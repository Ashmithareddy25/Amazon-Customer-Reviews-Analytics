B0007CNXUK|5.0|This is a terrific movie,\\"a Find\\"...It's a movie filled with a combination of humor,love,& sadness based upon real events!!!(The creation of Peter Pan.)It will be part of your permanent library.
B000AL730O|5.0|This is by far one of Paul McCartney's best works. The songwriting is as good as anything he has done with The Beatles. Many of these tracks would have fit nicely along side songs on \\"Rubber Soul\\" or \\"Revolver.\\"  <br />Yes, Paul sounds older, but his singing is still peerless.  Great album.
B00005ATQ9|5.0|without the amazing cinematography, serene settings, masterful costuming, and revolutionary approach to lighting, Barry Lyndon would still be a very good movie.  It is a beautiful stylized act of fictional biography more like a novel than any film of its genre. It should be metnioned however that the length and pacing of the film (which attributed to its popular failure upon release) can be a strong deturant to those of a nervous disposition.
B0002OERI0|1.0|1. They are the worst case of sellouts  2. They have barely any musical talent  3. Their songs all song alike  4. They tried to become new-generation rock  5. Anyone associated with them is a poser  6. They are posers and have made more kids into posers  7. After claiming hardrock they make terrible poser songs  8. Not one song they made has ever been good  9. Thanks to  them, all i can hear on radios is Holiday, the worst song of all time  10. I have to listen to people hum their retarded poser punk music in class    Now coems the best part....the poser wanna be rocker clicks no and tries to stay tough.......try listening to Zeppelin, if you arent too busy with the new-wave crappy excuse for music
B000AL730O|4.0|As a die-hard Paul and Beatles fan of many years, I have been anxiously waiting for the release of this new CD. I guess, I expected the usual balance of upbeat catchy rockers and beautiful ballads. I couldn't wait, so I rushed to listen to some poor-quality demos available online. I was in for a surprise. The first impression: disappointment. The music just didn't grab me, and I found myself impatiently skipping to the end of each song hoping to find that the next one will carry me away. It just didn't work the first time. Then I bought the CD (I _am_ a loyal fan, did I mention that? :) ) and gave it a good listen, this time - on a high-end stereo - and with a different attitude. I was amazed how much the songs touched me this time. It is, clearly, a different Paul. Mature, philosophical, a bit sad, but still hopeful and optimistic. The pace of the record is unusual for McCartney, it is more like something you'd expect from James Taylor, or, perhaps, even the recent Mark Knopfler. I had the same experience with the latest Mark Knopfler's CD - Shangri-La. The songs don't rock, they won't necessarily grab a casual listener who doesn't pay attention. However, if you _do_ listen, you immediately get mesmerized by the beauty and intelligence of the songs, you savor each sounds, each guitar lick, you recognize the genius behind the music.   This CD definitely contains some great acoustic guitar songs that, I know, I would enjoy playing on a winter night, sitting by the fireplace with my guitar, occasionally sipping a single malt. If you expect the likes of Helter-Skelter, Sgt Pepper, Beware My Love, She's A Woman, etc., you might be dissapointed. But if you can appreciate Winter Rose, Little Lamb Dragonfly, Teddy Boy, Blackbird, She's Leaving Home... the list goes on and on (it's Macca we're talking about) - you're in for a treat.  As for the rock-n-roll... I can't wait till next Tuesday when I see my boy Paul in concert in Boston! I've seen many live shows including theStones, but no one rocks like Paul McCartney in concert! The only people who disagree are the ones who haven't seen his live shows.
B000AL730O|1.0|Lord knows, I love Paul Mccartney & the Beatles. But this latest CD of his is an abomination. If Amazon alowed me to give it no stars whatsoever , that's what my rating would be . I listened to it once & then \\" regifted \\" it a fellow <br />Beatlemaniac friend in the vain hope he can derive something enjoyable from it. <br />I couldn't. It's a disgrace.
B00005TT77|5.0|Worth it for the Folds alone.<br /><br />Although, Ben Harper, Eddie, and Nick Cave really add to the album as well.
B000AL730O|1.0|I consider myself a McCartney fan however I'm not a fanatic and that's why I'm able to give an honest review of this album.  After listening to it I have to say that It wasn't what I'd expected it really lack flavor.  I tried my hardest to like it to find something that got me singing along I just couldn't find it.  \\"Flaming Pie\\" for me was a better album.  My advise have a friend make you a copy don't buy it until you hear it.  Next time he should try Jeff Lynne to produce him he did a great job with George's last Album don't you think? I give this album one star because I had to
B000A78Z82|5.0|Remember when Bob Dylan started playing with a full band with electric guitars?  Remember how many people rejected it yet even more people embraced it?  I have a feeling that with Devendra's new album \\"Cripple Crow\\" we'll see something similar, the only difference is that people won't be rejecting it at all.  Banhart is growing as a musician, a songwriter, a poet and an entertainer.  He's discovering exactly where he stands in today's music world and he knows he must grow better with each album, and he is, it's a conscience effort and you can hear it in this album. <br /> <br />There's no reason why you should not like this album.
B00006FM77|5.0|This album is really very good. The re-mastered edition is amazing. The set includes almost the same packaging extras of posters and booklet. This is from a devoted fan who wore out the 4LP edition and double 8track set when they were first sold.  <br />The fourth disc with previously un-released material is awesome. My favorite is \\"Hour in the Shower\\" which was from <br />Chicago III. You hear the amazing acoustics of Carnegie Hall with the opening chords of Terry Kaths' guitar. As you have read in the previous reviews, the LIVE IN JAPAN album is also  <br />very good. I hope they decide to release this in the same manner with the orginal packaging..
B000AU9UYM|5.0|This franchise has been revived by the smarts of Christopher Nolan and his colleagues.  Tim Burton's first two Batman movies were great, especially the first one with the ingenious decision of having Jack Nicholson as The Joker.  But Joel Schumacher ruined the franchise and I was saddened by the last two Batman films preceeding Batman Begins.  Thank God I can be enthuzed about Batman movies again and I can't wait until the next one to see my favorite villain of all time, the Harlequin of Hate, the Ace of Knaves, the Clown Prince of Crime, \\"The Joker\\"!!!!!  Rumor has it that Johnny Depp may play the Joker in the sequel, I think this is a good choice, but it is hard to fit the shoes of Jack Nicholson, he played such a great demonic clown.  This movie has to be in anybody's collection, it does not disapponit!
B000062YAZ|5.0|This album needs no hype. Korn couldn't possibly ever hope to even wipe these guy's collective asses. In the 80's it was all about speed--you just couldn't get any heavier than this. Despite coming after legendary bands such as Metallica, Motorhead, Iron Maiden, etc, Reign In Blood was, and still is in a class by itself. Remember, satanism in music was scary back then, not an overdone cliche like it is now, what with Marilyn Manson and these other numerous make-up wearing fruits. It also drove our parents crazy, never got any radio/video play, and spawned numerous imitators. If you haven't heard it, you're missing out on a piece of musical history.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|With all the recent albums that are being released by metal bands from the 80's(Saxon, Judas Priest,etc..) i wasnt expecting much from Brave New World and i figured it would be an almost comeback album with Bruce joining the line up again, but i was wrong. The album is epic, and now is my third favourite, next to Powerslave and Somewhere in time. When i first heard all the songs i couldnt believe that they were this new, with all the crap that is being churned out today i just didnt expect it. Wickerman is awesome, though i must say that i have listened to it too much and its lost the power it used to have, but this others hold the album up high making it a modern day masterpiece. Dance of Death is a good album, but its hard to listen to it all the way through. Brave New World is a must have, you must buy it. <br />1.Wickerman, i loved it but listened too much <br />2.Ghost Of Navigators, Pefect, the drums rock <br />3.Brave New World, starts out slow then kicks you in the head <br />4.Blood Brother, great use of string instruments, then the guitat solo makes you realize why you love metal <br />5.The Mercenary, wow thats all i can say <br />6.Dream of Mirrors, long but all worth it <br />7.Fallen Angel, fast and hard hitting like Mercenary <br />8.Nomad, great guitars and singing, also great strings <br />9.Out of the silent Planet, epic <br />10.The Thin Line Between Love and Hate, great song, listen to it all the way through then do it again and again.
0316548189|5.0|Mandela, in his autobiography \\"Long Walk To Freedom\\" has become an inspiration to me as a young African man. His humble beginnings with his mum at Qunu and later with his uncle, the regent, at Mqhekezweni, is typical of most Africans, me included.<br /><br />The \\"Long Walk To Freedom\\" is a book that brings out the brutal honesty of a man who's hunger for freedom overwhelms his desire to settle down at \\"...8115 Orlando East\\" with his family, and practice law at his \\"Mandela & Tambo\\" Law Firm, with the current Apartheid System of Government. It introduces us to the History of South Africa as a Nation under the brutal minority rule (Whiteman's rule). It open's our eyes to the continuation of his struggle against the Apartheid system even in the prisons he was sent to - Pretoria Local, Marshall Square & Robben Island. His struggle to remain sane in the face of apparent mistreatment from warders who were ordered to make his life unbearable.These warders were also ill informed on the reasons for his incarceration. While Apartheid had thrived for three centuries, he was determined not to let it survive his life time and devoted his life to make this happen.<br /><br />What stands out, is his loyalty to the ANC. In prison and out of prison he undertakes the task of teaching the people ANC policies, like a preacher devoted to teaching people about Jesus no matter his circumstances. Even in his talks to the government - who are bent on changing his view point - he refuses to accept anything short of what the ANC has been fighting for all along. The world has lessons to learn from the \\"Long Walk To Freedom\\". I recomend it to anyone who can get his hands on it.
0671027344|4.0|I found this book very interesting. It covers a lot of topics including (but not limited to) sexual abuse, homosexuality, physical abuse, drugs, and heartbreak. <br /> <br />I think charley was an interesting character, but was a bit out of place at some points. My favorite characters where Patrick & Sam. <br /> <br />When I was first told to read the book, I thought 'Oh, great. Thats that book that was all over MTV.'  <br /> <br />I didn't get the ending the first time I read it, but after I re-read it I did, and it put the whole book into a whole new perspective (one that made me read it again) <br /> <br />If you haven't read it yet, spend the $10 (or less!) and buy it, its worth it.
B000AADYYO|4.0|...the vanity plate on my truck reads OPETH. It's reached the point where Michael Akerfeldt could mike up a six-burner Viking range and release an album of him and the guys frying their own feces, and I would still preorder it. So, given that undying loyalty, the best compliment I can issue that still carries any weight is that this album didn't disappoint me. <br /> <br />Actually, maybe it did disappoint me a little. Peter Lindgren and Akerfeldt both made references in the Lamentations DVD that this album would be a true black metal album (instead of the melodic death metal that Opeth claims to be). Ghost Reveries is definitely not black metal. But, it's still awesome. The things that really stand out to me are the clarity, variety, and power of Akerfeldt's vocals -- he's really matured in his singing to the point where he finally seems to trust his voice. And the keyboards add a cool element too. Strangely, my favorite moment on the entire disc might be that little snippet just over a minute long that has negative counter numbers before the start of track 5 -- that guitar-and-synth progression is JUST SO COOL. I wish they had developed it into an entire song! <br /> <br />Martin Lopez is still the most buttkickingest drummer alive on earth.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|I will start off by saying that the album cover and the inside booklet look almost as crappy as the Blaze Bailey albums. But thats not the reason you buy an album, you buy one for the songs and material, and to be honest its not great, but its not bad either. Some songs on the album were excellent, worthy of Maiden. When i first heard Rainmaker i could have sworn it was from their earlier days, Gates of Tommorrow is also very good, and Face in the sand has epic bass kicks from Nicko. Most songs however i cant listen to like Wildest dream, Montsegur,New Frontier,Age of Innocence because they ae way too lame. <br />Dance of Death(the song), and the journeyman are great slow jams, but 5 songs cant surpport and album of 11. <br />If werent for Gates of Tommorrow and Face in the Sand i would never listen to this album, but it is still worth getting for those 5 tracks and to complete an iron maiden collection.
B0009I7NNA|1.0|Aveneged Sevenfold Waken the falling CD was prolly one of the best Cd's i owned, and their love for the music seemed to show very well. But everything changed once i heard Their single bat country. This song is by far the sadest thing ive heard in a long time, what happened to this band? This is prolly one of the WOrst and Most dissapointing Rock CD's ever. Their last cd had Amazing songs that were hard and put together amazingly with great strings in songs to make then great, not lame ass pop songs with no heart like this cd is full of. What blew me over the edge is when i read a interveiw with the lead singer, M SHaDOWs, Saying he doesnt care if the music is good as long as he make enough money to by his liquor and have fun. SO PLEASE PLEASE!!!!! do not by this CD it is without a doubt the biggest dissapoint ever, Expecially for ever Hard Avenged sevenfold fan from their last CD!!!
0789723107|5.0|This book has shed new light on usability for me. I've been a usability fan for some time, and although I feel I've got a good grasp on it, this book made a simple checklist for me to follow so as not to forget the most important points. My last 3 websites have been greatly improved as a result of reading this book and I recommend it to anyone working with web design, web development, project management and so on.
B000AL730O|3.0|Nearly two years later, this one continues to get better. Four-and-a-half stars. 6-07.       9-05  (It's still early) That's my caveat for the three-star rating. For me, McCartney's albums invariably take repeated listens to reveal themselves. I like the other comments I've read so far. This record is challenging, but probably not as difficult musically as Wild Life or Press to Play. It is a highly polished album, that much is clear. It definitely feels like music for adults, unlike parts of most of the rest of his pop/rock output. So far, the majority of the tunes sound similar, with the exception of Fine Line and Promise To You Girl, both of which I like a great deal. My favorite at the moment is Follow Me, probably because I already knew it from McCartney's appearance last year at Neil Young's Bridge School show.
B000002I2M|5.0|I've loved the Doors since I was a toddler, but it was relatively recently that I started collecting their albums.  This being said, L.A. Woman is essential to any Doors fan; it is not only the final effort of the original lineup and, therefore, a piece of musical history, but it marks a genuine return to form for the band.  The first three studio albums were excellent and unique releases, while the fourth and fifth were of debatable musical quality.  However, L.A. Woman proves that the band did not lose their creative edge, opting instead to go out with a bang!   <br /> <br />There has been much commentary regarding the \\"change\\" in Jim Morrison's singing on this album.  While it is probably true that Jim's hard living aged him a few decades since the Doors' first album, the \\"craggy, worn-out\\" vocals he utilizes in songs such as \\"Been Down So Long\\" and \\"L.A. Woman\\" appear to be little more than a stylistic change  (and not a bad one, I might add).  If this is not the case, then why do \\"L'America,\\" \\"Hyacinth House,\\" and \\"Riders on the Storm\\" feature Mr. Morrison's trademark smooth baritone?  Many have also commented on the strong blues influence found in L.A. Woman, stating as well that the Doors could no longer be classified as psychedelic (even though this label itself was very limiting to such a creative rock group and, therefore, somewhat inaccurate).  While it is true that L.A. Woman is probably the band's most blues-influenced album, it can hardly be classified as standard blues rock; there are still plenty of psychedelic touches on at least half, if not most, of the songs, not to mention the dark undercurrent that continues to distinguish the band decades after their time.  Besides, the strong influence of the blues is present on every single one of their prior releases.   <br /> <br />And now for the music itself!  \\"The Changeling\\" is an excellent opener; it is a fairly standard blues rocker, but it is executed with plenty of power and gusto, and the psychedelic interlude is a nice touch.  \\"Love Her Madly,\\" a bluesy, honkytonk rocker, is also a very good song, with some trademark Doorsesque organ thrown in the middle.  Other highlights include the raunchy title track, the creepy \\"L'America,\\" and \\"The WASP,\\" a cross between a spoken word piece and a strong blues rocker.  \\"Crawling King Snake,\\" which I believe to be a cover of a blues song, is, in my opinion, an excellent effort by the Doors.  It features some of the greatest and most innovative guitar work by Robbie Krieger, fusing blues leads with jarring dissonance that predates dissonant post-punk guitar from the late seventies/early eighties- it is unique even for the Doors!  The only really weak song is \\"Cars Hiss By My Window,\\" as it is a real snoozer.  And last, but certainly not least, is the brooding \\"Riders on the Storm,\\" a calm and jazzy (but trippy) number with a sprinkling of psychedelic flavor that serves as the perfect closer for the album.  Ironically, the song, as well as the album itself, also works as a beautiful farewell from one of the greatest and most unique rock acts of the 20th century.
6304602979|5.0|This film is great.  Best work from Tony Scott.  And this director's cut even better than the original seen on TV. <br />The end of the film should be the only reason to see this film. <br />Best end in years.
B00005Q66T|5.0|It's not often that a recording artist can actually stay true to the title of \\"Greatest Hits\\", while actually including all hits. See recent Hits packages by Hilary Duff, Michael Jackson, and Mariah Carey, where remixes, b-sides, flopped singles alternate cuts, and even non-singles must be added to fill up the disc.  It's even more rare for an artist to be able to fill a SECOND greatest hits package, without any overlap, and STILL have certifiable hits left off.<br /><br />GHV2 starts out where The Immaculate Collection left off, 1992.<br /><br />Deeper & Deeper hit #7 on the charts (#1 in Dance) and was the second single off of Erotica. It was a disco flavored house / pop hybrid.<br /><br />Erotica, the controversial, dark lead off single from the album of the same name, hit #3 (#1 in Dance). Human Nature hit #46, but was #2 in sales and in huge rotation on MTV & VH-1.<br /><br />Secret, the lead off single from Bedtime Stories, hit #3 (#1 Dance) is up next. Don't Cry For Me Argentina hit #8 (#1 Dance), is included in ballad form, not the Miami Dance Remix that was also very popular in the clubs.<br /><br />GHV2 then dips back to Bedtime Stories again with the way ahead of its time \\"Bedtime Story\\", the 3rd single from the album. It hit #42 (#1 Dance). We then skip to the 3rd US single from Ray Of Light, the hyperballad \\"Power Of Goodbye\\". It peaked at #11.<br /><br />\\"Beautiful Stranger\\" the glouriously delicious throwback to the 70's, hit #16 (#1 Dance, #1 Sales), follows. \\"Frozen\\" is up next. The lead of single from Ray Of Light hit #2 (#1 Dance, #1 Sales).<br /><br />We go back to the Bedtime Story album with \\"Take A Bow\\", which spent 11 weeks at #1, as well as 9 weeks at the top Sales spot. \\"Ray Of Light\\" (#5, #1 Dance, #1 Sales) follows.<br /><br />The stuttering \\"Don't Tell Me\\" comes up next and hit #4 (#1 Dance, #1 Sales). \\"What It Feels Like For A Girl\\" is next. It hit #23 (#1 Dance, #1 Sales). Drowned World wasn't released in the US, but this set was also intended for international release and it hit #10 in the UK. It's ashame this wasn't released in the US, as it is one of the most touching, heartfelt songs in her catalouge. \\"Music\\" the biggest hit in her 2nd decade in music finishes off the collection.

These include \\"This Used To Be My Playground\\" (#1), Bad Girl (#36), I'll Remember (#1), You'll See (#6), You Must Love Me (#18), and American Pie (#29).<br /><br />All in all, GHV2 is a true testament to the power of Madonna.

B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day to me has rarely been an album band. Many bands like say Pearl Jam or many U2 records song-to-song never falters. There's always a level of consistency. Not the case with Green Day. You'll have 3 strong songs then crap for a couple then one good, then couple more crap. I even can't stand most of their Hits album. But this actually is a very consistent record. While the songs may not be instant faves, there is a level of \\"well it's not that bad\\".    American Idiot: First single and while it is a good song, it's not really a good representation of the album. This could've easily fit on Nimrod or Insomniac. One of my favorite little bits is after the chords he adds in a little \\"stab\\" at the higher strings. Good but not awesome. 8.5/10    Jesus of Suburbia: One of the album's 2 long songs with 5 sections each and this one flows the best. My favorite section is the I Don't Care one and Tales from Another Broken Home. The Dearly Beloved section nearly derails the entire thing though. 9/10    Holiday: Incredibly overplayed I can't stand it anymore. It's a good song, good beat but god I can't hear it anymore. It does work as a song though and if you're new to the song you'll like it but for the rest of us with video stations and radio, you can't stand another listen. 8/10    Boulevard of Broken Dreams: Segues from Holiday nicely with some tremolo guitar and a catchy guitar line during the verses. One thing does disturb me though: the chorus chords are exactly the same as Holiday's chorus except the order is different. 8/10    Are We the Waiting: Green Day's attempt at making a big stadium sing-along but it sounds eerily similar to Youth of the Nation personally. It's not a bad song, just not a standout either. 7/10    St. Jimmy: I used to skip this but after seeing it performed on Storytellers I started to like it more. The dawning of our lives line is similar to Holiday though which of course I can't stand anymore. 8/10    Give Me Novacaine: One of those unsung album songs that doesn't really get attention until you sit through the entire album. It's a nice song, sung very well with almost tropical(best way to describe it) sounding chords. 7.5/10    She's a Rebel: Another rocker but I don't like it that much. I can't put my finger on it but I never did like it. Not much to say about it either. 7/10    Extraordinary Girl: Different sounding song with an Egyptian flavor but I don't know, never really liked this one either. Just doesn't appeal to me much. 7/10    Letterbomb: This is probably the oddest song on the album I actually like. It's not insanely catchy, takes awhile to get to the chorus but it's actually quite good. 7.5/10    Wake Me Up When September Ends: When compared to the other \\"ballads\\" the band's done like Macy's Day Parade and Good Riddance, it's not that great. Guitar is nice, vocals are simple yet emotional but something oddly turns me off. 7.5/10    Homecoming: The other 9 minute 5 part song and it doesn't flow as well as Jesus but it does have my favorite section of all of them: The final half of last section Coming Home Again where it gets all anthemic then it gets Zeppelin/military style. Awesome ending but the rest is just merely good. 8/10    Whatsername: Probably my favorite album closer ever beside Macy's Day Parade. Very laid-back until it gets big and awesome including the final verses. It seems rather odd to close the song rather than the ending of Homecoming but the \\"bigness\\" of this ending just fits and that final D chord sounds better than that damn kid from Homecoming. 9.5/10    If you're into Green Day, definately check this out. If you're into \\"punk\\" such as Black Flag or Dead Kennedy's well take a chance or try it out online but this is an album to listen to.
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|Yeah, the plot was a little slow and... non-existant. Yeah, Cloud was a little out of the character we left at the end of the game. But the others side characters were done well, even for the short cameo's they had. I could've put money on what Yuffie said when she first came on the scene, \\"Who has my materia?!\\" Vincent was his usual smooth, depressing self, Barrett was trying hard to be the hero and Tifa still seemed to have a thing for Cloud. All of this stayed wonderfully similar to the game. I was disappointed by Cait Sith's appearance, especially riding on Red XIII. I kind of wished they would have put Reeves in there instead of sticking with the doll. (He doesn't need it anymore, there's no one to play \\"double agent\\" to.) <br /> <br />I won't spoil anything major, but the plot did suffer a little bit. I've watched it twice now and I'm still not sure why certain things happen the way they do, or where the three men came from.  <br /> <br />Still, if you are a fan of FFVII at ALL it's definately a must... if only to see your favorite character's take on a third dimension... as well as actual limbs instead of blocks and triangles. The fight scenes were fast and hard to follow at times, but after watching it twice I still feel an extreme thrill watching Cloud in the end fight scene.  <br /> <br />Please note though, if you have the popular bootlegged, subtitled version that has already spread like a wildfire, you are OBLIGATED to buy the real one. Don't rip off the production company and the people who worked on this film just because you were a little impatient. Plus, think of all the extra's you'll be getting with the legitimate DVD!
B0006L16N8|3.0|Apparently I am in the minority, but I found this album to be over the top, especially in its production. The songs are so saturated and overly produced that you get lost in the muck. Coldplay's first two albums relied heavily on moderately progressive songwriting and interesting musical arrangements. This album is so self indulgent at times I can't help but think that the band is merely pandering to commercial interest, what they think will sell the most records, and what would get them the best contract with iTunes. This album is definitely the most pretentious of the three. That is not to say that there are not bright spots on X&Y, but the first two albums are a perfect example that \\"less is more.\\" To me, this album was a step back artistically.
0800141849|4.0|I like the romance, but I hate the idea of the beauty and the handsome living a perfect life. <br />This is a romantic story, about a man who believes in rationality, and a smart, women who believes in love and joy, and of course a perfect bite. <br /> <br />The only negative thing is the DVD doesn't have a menu, or any option.
B000683VI4|4.0|My husband rented this movie after a friend told me about it.  I did not really have any idea of the plot before turning it on, but once I did, I got right into the movie.  Yes, it sounds like another sappy love story (and I don't typically fall for those), but this movie was so touching it made me cry.  I fought back the tears until the end... the end is really touching.<br /><br />I am now in the process of reading the novel.  At this point I believe that this is one of those few cases where the movie is better than the book.  The movie has more detail in certain aspects of the plot and the cinematography really helps set the scene for the love story.<br /><br />Overall this is a story of a romance that could not be stopped.  Talk about dedication... just watch the movie, you'll see.
B0000028M7|5.0|This is THE gruge cd.Soulful electric blues,with a lovely taste of metal.This cd is probably the onley perfect recording of what we know of grunge,blues today.Evrything I hear I compare to this band and(or)Dirt.It's such a joy to listen to.Please take note,and i'm not jokeing.If you are a real fan of this type of music,Dirt will bring you to tears at some point in time.The odd part is you never know when it will happen while you're listening to it.What's your drug of choice?
B0000AKCLS|4.0|JB presents awesome and sometimes different takes on some great blues classics. Truly refreshing. An overall great CD, with only one or two songs straying away from the path chosen for this album. They are not bad songs, but should perhaps have been saved for another album. And JB really knows how to rip the strings when he has to. Wonder if he ever listened to Walter Trout the way he plays with the volume on his guitars?? <br />Bottom line: Buy this CD!! You won't regret it!
B00000272N|5.0|First of all,to let you know where I'm comming from,Alice In Chains is probably one of the top bands of all time.At least in my book.Although Facelift is probably not THE Grunge alblum,it does hit very hard and after the first four songs you are literly dazed and confused.Looking back now as I have done many times before at my collection of cd's,there are so many ways I compare them to Facelift,now more then ever.This cd gets more dreary then grungey.Buy this cd if you wanna know what the word Gruge realy is.In reality it means soulful,electric blues.This cd embraces the more funkyer type,almost jazz like blues with a hint of 80's rock and roll.In my opinion this is what defined the years when Jimmi and Cream ruled and Led Zepplen and Black Sabbath stoled and took off with...say what?
B000022TSH|2.0|I'd love to comment on the content of the film but it seems that neither of the Chinatown DVD's I recieved from Amazon will play in my DVD player. Instead they start to spin up and just make a strange noise and are otherwise not recognized. Both discs I recieved were/are in flawless shape. I have something in the neighborhood of 200 DVDs and none have ever had this issue. My DVD player is not defective, is new and a recognized brand so there just must be something wrong with the way these DVD's were made. They seem quite old from 1999 or so. I've heard of other older discs having issues like this such as the first version of \\"The Deer Hunter\\" so perhaps it's time this movie is rereleased so I can actually watch it. Hopefully amazon will recredit me as I've sent both of the discs back. I wish I could have watched the movie though.
0446310786|5.0|This is a very good book.When my teacher first gave me this to read I thought it was another dumb kid's book. I was wrong. This <br />book is so well written.It has a great plot and its so realistic. I felt I was right there with Scout and Jem. If you want something beautiful,fun, and heart warming to read this is the book.

B00005JKES|5.0|Too bad it couldn't have been renewed for the originally-intended 3rd season.  For the purposes of this review, I will concentrate on the series itself rather than the DVD value/quality; suffice it to say that I am less than thrilled that I was forced to buy a crappy Japanese import of the pilot, complete with ridiculously bad, unremovable English subtitles.   <br /> <br />Twin Peaks is vintage David Lynch, and all David Lynch fans (we are a rabid bunch) are guaranteed to cherish this show.  But it's appeal extends beyond that niche.  It is a murder mystery/soap opera, but this doesn't even scratch the surface.  Never have so many elements combined to make a show so compelling.  The murder mystery has some obvious Lynch trademarks, punctuated with creepy, meaningful shots, such as the spinning ceiling fan or the infamous domino.  The soap elements somehow blend in seamlessly, and that is a triumph.  When you are first watching the show, it is nearly impossible to know what will directly relate to the \\"who killed Laura Palmer\\" question and what doesn't, but everything has meaning.  There are no throw-away moments here.   <br /> <br />The element of Twin Peaks that is probably most enduring, having worked it's way into pop culture lore, is Kyle McLachlan's performance as FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper.  His hokey, folksy declarations about cherry pie and Douglas Firs give way, suddenly at times, to the intense visions and startling realizations that both disturb and excite a psychic like Cooper.  Did I catch you off-guard with that, if you haven't seen the series?  This important point is introduced just as casually in the show; Cooper acts as if it is a given that he is psychic and never bothers to \\"announce\\" this fact.  He is also highly intuitive and logical, a multiple threat of a detective.  All portrayed convincingly by McLachlan, one of the most underrated actors of our time. <br /> <br />Twin Peaks, of course, is a place where the more wholesome something seems, the more it actually isn't.  This is a theme that has been explored in countless books, films and shows, but never as effectively.  There are a few storylines that stand out (all will be related in the end) in the first season:  Agent Cooper and Sheriff Truman's investigation, of course, but also the continuing saga of Leland Palmer's deteriorating mental state.  There is undercover bad girl Audrey Horne's brazen snooping, not to mention her bordering-on-inappropriate yet exciting flirtation with Agent Cooper (and his barely restrained mutual attraction).   <br /> <br />I'll move on now to one of my favorite subplots in order to give an idea of what to expect from this show, the surprisingly compelling illicit relationship of high-school football hero/boyfriend of Laura Palmer Bobby Briggs and high-school dropout diner waitress Shelley Johnson, who just so happens to be married to a psychopath who may have had a hand in Laura's murder.  Here, David Lynch has taken something that could be overwrought and labored, as it would be on a soap opera, and made it one of the more suspensful subplots.  This highlights another of the show's great performances, Dana Ashbrook as Bobby.  This portrayal is rather difficult to describe.  From afar, Bobby appears to be the perfect popular boy--the quarterback with the prom-queen girlfriend.  Closer up, he appears to be a belligerent, smart-assed punk with little respect for authority and a penchant for getting himself involved in the darker side of Twin Peaks.  It is only in the scenes with Shelley that you realize that he is not as tough as he first appears, and beyond a doubt gentle and loving with women--it really is rather shocking.  The willigness of the seemingly selfish, cavalier Bobby to put himself in danger in order to protect Shelley from her abusive husband makes for some compelling viewing.  I really can't believe I'm writing this about an \\"affair storyline,\\" one of many on this show.  But that is David Lynch for you.You always know the characters Lynch is fond of, certainly Cooper, but the train-wreck Bobby Briggs as well.  Watch out for some of Bobby's signature quotes, some of the funniest on the show--\\"All of you hypocrites make me SICK!!\\" (Tastefully screamed at Laura Palmer's funeral).  Or the way he casually puts a cigarette in his mouth as his war veteran father attempts to have a \\"man-to-man\\" with him.  Look to Bobby and Agent Cooper for some of the series' wittier moments. <br /> <br />I could go on forever higlighting all of the things that make this show great, but it really is something you have to experience for yourself.  It is the kind of thing that sticks with you days after you watch it, and you will feel personally connected with and attached to the well-developed characters. <br /> <br />If you have an open mind, devour this DVD.  You won't be disappointed (except for the lack of the pilot--you HAVE to wathch it first and will unfortunately have to look for it seperately).
B000002I4S|5.0|another 5 star Coltrane affair. you cannot go wrong with this cd. ful of great harmonies that twist and turn from every angle and yet have the 'hook' power to get stuck in your head. you'll be humming some of these melodies for days on end. a classic recording full of timeless and brilliant music.
068987474X|5.0|Loved the book! At first while I was reading it, I became naseaous....it was upsetting that the authors were confirming something my intuition had always been screaming at me about...and I only wish I had this book when I was younger....I am certainly having my teenage daughter read this one!
B0000508U6|3.0|does anyone one really need to know another opinion about this album?
B0000640VN|2.0|I thought this movie had no plot whatsoever and it just dragged on and on. Slow and boring... you keep waiting for something to happen!! Too much bad language and NOT sutible for the whole family. I was so bored with this one!
B0002OERI0|5.0|As a reborn, moderate Green Day fan, I expected to only like and listen to the songs for which I bought the CD... American Idiot, Holiday, Boulevard of Dreams and Wake Me Up When Sept. Ends.  To my surprise, every song on the CD has become my \\"favourite\\".  Awesome CD!!!
B0007CNXUK|1.0|This movie was so boring! Cheesy (like the little English kids would just start playing with total stranger Johnny Depp). They mumbled the whole movie, I had my TV loud and understood less than 5% of what was said! I was still waiting for a plot and something to happen and then it was over! Very sad, depressing and dissapointing ending. Glad I didn't waste money seeing this in theaters!
B00005MM67|1.0|Aw man...This movie made me want to climb inside a volcano.  This movie is about to boring characters, (one who is an uptight snoozer, and the other a typical party boy) who argue about climbing a lousy mountain for half of the duration of the film. There are some useless and boring conflicts about one guy's wife not wanting him to go, and the other guy is a loser and has nothing better to do.<br /><br />If the ending was anything fun to talk about I would love to spoil the ending for you, but I found myself hoping they both die a horrible death up on the mountain. As a matter of fact,I was hoping I would die because the movie really is that terrible.
B000A6T1KE|2.0|Being a Trek fan for 30 something odd years I have seen 100's of hours of Trek from the time I was 5 until now so I think it's easy to see what works and what doesn't. This unfortunately does not. You have a movie that closely resembles the best Trek film Star Trek 2 but not nearly as good; The revenge storyline down to the sacrifice at the end of the film. Been there, seen that, but with out the humanity and adventure brought to the characters that was so evident in S.T. 2.<br /><br />I remember reading a lot about the movie before it opened and was eagerly awaiting this movie but they cut quite a few scenes with could have enriched the film and given the characters more to do. Gone are scenes at Riker and Troi's wedding (If you look closely you can see the character of Wesley) which I think would have brought this up a notch. There was another scene between Data and Picard over a glass of wine that was cut and a longer ending which would have brought more closure to the Next Gen. Crew.<br /><br />Why not reedit this for the fans that wanted to see it?<br /><br />As these Special Editions are rolled out every few months they get less \\"Special\\" and seem to throw things out there for money sakes.<br /><br />Why not a cast commentary?<br /><br />This will ever be known as the Trek film that altered the Even(good films)/Odd (Bad films). Ashame since this had so much potential. Maybe that potential is on the cutting room floor.
B000007RV5|3.0|I first heard this back in 1998, and I was overwhelmed by the raw sound this album contained. This is one of my all time favorite hard rock albums. Well... back then, I did not know that Fred Durst is an idiot. <br /> <br />This is best described as an \\"attitude album\\" (so are all other LB releases). Anybody who ONLY listens to serious music should stay away from this. The guitar, bass, drum playing are exceptional except that the vocal has nothing to spew but childish rants. It's fun. <br /> <br />It is SUPPOSED TO BE FUN! <br /> <br />...until Fred started saying at awards shows that \\"music is everything, music touches the soul... blablabla\\". Yeah right, people get touched in the soul when told to \\"get the f* up\\" or \\"I did it all for the nookie\\". The stupid lyrics wouldn't have mattered if Fred himself chose not to be taken seriously. <br /> <br />So there you have it--- critics and haters everywhere. If only Fred would just shut the hell up and maybe this band could've had a better reputation at present. <br /> <br />I just want to be completely honest with a few things: <br /> <br />1) In this album, Fred CAN rap. He's got some flow however little on most of the tracks here (\\"Pollution\\", \\"Counterfeit\\", \\"Stuck\\"). Saying he can't rap is an overstatement- and you know it. Hatred blinds you for the most part. <br /> <br />2) I cannot stress this any more clearer: STOP TAKING THIS BAND SERIOUSLY! If you want serious music, stop thinking Fred can give you that. Fred Durst can rot in hell, but this band's all about having fun. If you have gone to some of their concerts (before the damage done to the band's image became irreparable--- that is, sometime before 2001) it's all about dynamics. People enjoyed their live shows then. Today, I honestly do not know how the people would take it if they see Fred Durst on stage again. <br /> <br />3) For those saying Wes, Sam, Otto suck at what they do, again you are blinded by hatred. They are truly the reason why the band is popular. Wes is truly the talent of the band. He is innovative and his riffs are catchy apart from heavy. Sam has a unique groove to his playing... perfectly fits a rap-rock band. And otto, so far he's the only drummer of a mainstream band with the best groove- although at times his style can get predictable, but nonetheless, he is a good drummer. I just hate hearing comments that \\"Otto sounds like he just got out of his fourth drum lesson\\". These comments are all too stereotypical, I pity the commentator. <br /> <br />Anybody who wants to listen to hard rock as raw as it gets, get this album. If you're more into lyrics, go get Incubus instead. Lastly, if you hate Limp Bizkit that much, get over it and see the talent of the people behind Fred Durst's shadow. <br /> <br />Peace and love.

It's totally cool.\\" <br />\\" Nah man that stuff's just for wimps and 15 year old cred seekers constantly looking at Pitchfork or some lame-ass magazine and totally buying into what they say. It's horses*it \\" <br />\\" No way man, like it's totally cool. Have you listened to it fully man, don't judge an album just because it's been hyped to bits.

You wouldn't do that, would you?\\" <br />\\" Try me. Play that album one more time and I might just do it. I ain't afraid to either.\\" <br />\\" Man I never knew you could hate something THAT much.\\" <br />\\" You'd be surprised. I've come to the conclusion that indie now stands for 'innocent ninnies don't initiate enterprise.' The music's just not original anymore. It has no heart <br />\\" Oh but you didn't hear about the story that went behind this, it's so, like, heartbreaking.\\" <br />\\" No it's not. I completely empathize with their grief at losing relatives but that still doesn't make this album any good. Can we drop the subject. I feel like punching something.\\" <br />\\" OK, man, I'll drop it. I still don't understand your point of view but I guess I'll just have to accept it.\\"
B00005JOHU|4.0|I'm going to borrow an analogy used in the recent Supreme Court confirmation hearings for a moment. When Nicholas Cage comes up to bat, he frequently hits singles or misses, but when he hits a homerun, it is usually out of the ballpark. Cage has certainly made his share of crappy (\\"Gone in 60 Seconds\\") or mediocre films (\\"The Family Man\\"), but he has also, occasionally, made really good films. Films that he should be proud of. Films that would do a Nicholas Cage Film Festival proud. \\"Lord of War\\" is such a film.<br /><br />Directed by Andrew Niccol (the writer of \\"The Truman Show\\" and the writer/director of the underappreciated \\"Gattaca\\" and the rightfully forgotten \\"Simone\\"), \\"War\\" is a dark comedy that falters only once or twice. This coupled with a terrific performance by Cage make it a memorable film. Whether it becomes a remembered film has yet to be seen.<br /><br />Yuri Orlov (Cage) and his brother Vitale (Jared Leto) are second generation Ukrainian immigrants helping their Catholic parents run a Kosher restaurant in the Little Odessa neighborhood of New York. One day, Yuri witnesses a gang shootout and realizes that money can be had from selling guns. He talks Vitale into partnering with him and they start a business taking them into war zones across the globe. As the money rolls in, each spends on their vice of choice; Vitale starts snorting profit through his nose and Yuri romances Eve (Bridget Moynahan), a famous model from the old neighborhood. After they are married, the Cold War ends and business really picks up. A zealous ATF agent (Ethan Hawke) sets his sights on Yuri.<br /><br />Reportedly based on true events, \\"War\\" is a fast-paced, darkly comic look at a man we should loathe.<br /><br />Cage's performance is great. The film begins with Yuri breaking the fourth wall; addressing the audience from the screen, talking about his business and his morals (\\"I never sold guns to Osama Bin Laden. Not on moral grounds, just at that time, his checks were always bouncing.\\") setting the tone for his character and the film. Throughout the film, Yuri frequently provides narration which is light and breezy, a brilliant counterpoint to the subject matter. This also helps to make his character more memorable, because what he says is usually completely at odds with what we should be feeling or experiencing. Somehow, and I'm not entirely sure how he does it, Cage makes Yuri a sympathetic guy. Yuri is a drug runner who sells weapons and helps keep wars going so he can make more money. He occasionally uses drugs and also cheats on his wife, Eve. Yet, we care for him. When he gets into dangerous situations, we want him to get out safely. How did Cage accomplish this? Part of it is that we see him in dangerous situations. Other people die. The danger is there. Things happen to him. He isn't completely unaffected either. Because we feel for him, we laugh at ourselves for being taken in by this character which in turn adds to the dark humor.<br /><br />Niccol manages to tell a political story, without preaching. We learn or witness as the story unfolds. The beginning sequence, a terrific point of view shot of the journey of a single bullet from manufacture to use also helps to quickly establish what Niccol is trying to do. He uses Yuri as his mouthpiece, serious at times and completely unaffected at others. Because we are watching the events through this character's eyes, it would be impossible for the film to be very preachy. Yuri wouldn't stand around and preach about this or that, so Niccol doesn't either. Even though Yuri frequently makes statements about his impartiality to one conflict or the other, his statements and what he witnesses inform us. Parts of the story are serious and others are satirical. Niccol maintains this blend well throughout faltering only a few times in the last act.<br /><br />The supporting cast is good. Jared Leto is convincing as Vitale, Yuri's coked out, out of control younger brother. Bridget Moynahanis also good as Eve, Yuri's wife, who doesn't face the truth until forced to. Ian Holm makes a brief appearance as an old school gunrunner, Yuri's main competition.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke's role as Agent Valentine is little more than a glorified cameo. Hawke starred in Niccol's first film \\"Gattaca\\" and I get the sense they wanted to work together again, no matter the project. It seems as though Valentine is meant to be the character who reflects was we should be feeling, the conscience of the audience. In his few moments on screen, he says what we should say; he displays the disgust we should feel. But the character is, as mentioned, only on screen for a brief period. Thankfully. If the character did work, providing a Yang to balance Cage's Ying, the film would lose a significant amount of its dark humor. It's a small role and odd that they would use his name in the advertisements.<br /><br />\\"Lord of War\\" is not a perfect film, but it is a memorable one and it contains a great performance from Nicholas Cage.get Moynahan is also good as Eve, Yuri's wife, who doesn't face the truth until forced to.

B000002AH9|2.0|I listen to this cd because billie is my moms favorite singer and she heard this is one of her best boy were they wrong. Her voice is so bad becasue of all the drugs she has done and music is way overproduce. Billie was at her best with a more strip down sound with just a couple of musicans not a few blowed orcherstra. Fans like this because it is billie and if she sang the phone book they would by it and the fact that her life was just as bad as the songs that she sang. You make love a artist a whole lot but you got to admit when they have done something that is far from there best that does not mean that you should love them anyless. The one good thing about billie is that there is alot of her music to chosse from before you buy this.

B00005NWM3|3.0|This is not the worst CD I ever listened to. However, it is not the best either. See, the songs on it are very different from those on The Long Road. Some are worth hearing such as \\"How U Remind me\\" and \\"Just For.\\" Unfortunately, there are also some very crummy ones, such as \\"Too Bad.\\" The good thing is, this CD at least has some good in it and is not the album that ended the career of Nickelback, my favorite band, as said above. Even so, there are just a bit too many flaws for it to be in my top CDs. Then again, it still has enough good to be worth keeping. In short, this CD is alright, and if you must choose between a sucky CD and this one, you should get this one.
B000AL730O|4.0|Since the Lennon-McCartney break-up, Sir Paul has treated us to album after album filled with uninspiring songs, that often sound like he's making them up as he records them.  This isn't one of them; it contains at least three, maybe more, very good songs. In fact, I think \\"Jenny Wren\\" may be the best thing he's done in 30 years. Still, it's sad what the years and too many smokes have done to Sir Paul's voice. However I, for one, am just glad that he's not willing to sit on his billion, but is still creating. As long as McCartney's performing, making new music, I'll still feel young!
B0000024ZT|5.0|Basically, this album is a master-class in songwriting.  <br /> <br />This album, and The Wild, The Innocent..., went unnoticed before Bruce hit the streets with Born to Run. However, I started my Springsteen collection while this was still fresh and, although I had bought it by accident (Manfred Mann's version of Blinded By the Light was popular and I *thought* I was buying the album with THAT song on it!) and was deeply dissapointed with it at first, it grew on me quickly as I grew up, quickly. Now, except for Mary Queen of Arkansas (Hey, even Blood on the Tracks has it's one dud song), every track on this album has a special place in my heart. <br /> <br />(Actually, now that I think about it, all of Bruce's albums have at least one lame song. I've never really enjoyed any of his slow pieces, think it has to do with his voice...) <br /> <br />I love the lyrical poetry here, because for every moment it seems pointless and rambling there's a moment where it's surprising and thought-provoking. I like that the TEXT plays such a big role in the songs and in my opinion it surpasses Dylan's writing (I AM a Dylan fan). <br /> <br />When this came out, all the songs sounded so fresh, every moment on the album is a moment that had never been heard in recorded music before.  <br /> <br />I think the composition on this album is better than practically everything that came after it. There isn't even a hint of the breathless bombast that burst out of Bruce with Born to Run but but somehow I get an even bigger adrenaline rush listening to, for example, For You or Lost in the Flood than I do from the later albums. <br /> <br />Also, I'm from Pearl River, NY, a little town on the NY/NJ border that Bruce used to hang out in. I knew people who knew him, etc... There was a street in Pearl River called Springsteen Street and the town had to build a special heavy concrete foundation for the street sign because it kept getting stolen, lol. I saw Bruce at the Garden a couple times andone time he somehow got wind that we were there and he actually called out, \\"This one is for the boys from Pearl River, I know you're out there somwhere!\\". So, I'm sort of biased when it comes to his earlier works as the music was a huge part of my youth... Looking back, I have to say, it was one of the truly good parts, too.

B000646MNE|5.0|The reason why I say this is because they make the woman of new york,Look like whores,The funny reason is the producers are not even from here.People who come from other boring states tend to come here and at like newyorkers but really they don't know one thing about the real new york.They come here to live in manhattan and think they know new york.But to change the subject the show is really interesting and very funny the show stays with one subject \\"sex\\" and tells the subject like if your in school because of so much depth in the subject. The relationships will keep you glue in during the series,so even though every thing is not okay with this shallow show I must approve it's worth to see.
0316172324|2.0|Perhaps \\"Waste of Time\\" is a bit harsh of a description for this book.  While there are concepts and ideas inside that may be fresh to most people, some of the subjects Gladwell focuses on can be a bit boring or even a stretch to back up his point.  He talks about how Coke changed their formula after the Pepsi taste tests showed people in favor of Pepsi, and a police force that guns down a child they thought was pulling out a gun that was actually a wallet.<br /><br />In regards to the stories Gladwell uses to back himself up, he gets into explaining how our tastes change when we consume larger or smaller quantities of a product, which is why Pepsi fared better in taste tests.  He also got into how causing people to describe their feelings ended up changing the outcome of test results.  I guess he was trying to prove how initial feelings can be different than secondary ones, but is this really a new concept?<br /><br />In the beginning of the book there was something strange about him saying that he was only going to focus on what he calls \\"thin slicing\\" (a term he uses annoyingly often), and wasn't going to wander off into other topics.  Why would you have to say this to the reader?  I find when authors try setting up thier books in such a way, they end up straying from their original intended purpose as Gladwell greatly does.  While he says he spent a long time writing this book, the topics he chooses seem somewhat of a stretch to his original point that snap decisions are usually the best ones.<br /><br />What does all this tell us?  At the end I can't say I have a convincing argument as to how snap decisions (thin-slicing) are better.  In life I have found myself glad for not making quick decisions, rewarded by balancing all of the correct data.  I feel as if Gladwell could just as easily write a book as to why weighing all the options equally prove to be just as rewarding.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|Sigur Ros has easily become one of my top 10 favorite bands of all time, and over the course of only 4 years. I was introduced to them through the Vanilla Sky Soundtrack and just melted over Untitled #4 (a.k.a. \\"The Nothing Song\\").  <br />Takk Has a unique sound unlike their previous three albums. The songs on Takk have a more faster paced beat that turn into these long and amazing cries of guitar strings mixed with jonsi's voice that fit together so beautifully. Each track has just the most georgeous sounds of existensialism that post rock has to offer. I believe that Sigur Ros have a long life ahead of themselves and I will eagerly await their next great album.
B000AL730O|1.0|Well... I am a Wings fanatic.  And I also love his solo stuff.  And I really dislike when people compare an artist's work to their past efforts....  But, I can't help but think that this is his worst effort, topping even McCartney 2 and Pipes of Peace.<br /><br />I think the thing that misses most is any sort of rock.  \\"Promise to You Girl\\" has the most electricity to it... and that's not saying much (Well, the untitled jam at the end of the album, the last three minutes of \\"Anyway,\\" are pretty cool).  \\"Fine Line\\" has grown on me.  But the rest of it?  I've had the album almost a week now and STILL haven't listened to it all the way through (by contrast, when I downloaded Driving Rain off the internet, I had made several plays through in the first two days).<br /><br />The tracks I really don't like off Driving Rain, like \\"Back in the Sunshine,\\" \\"Your Way,\\" and \\"I Do,\\" these are the kind of fluff that fill this album.  It's supposed to be all inspiring and full of emotion?  Yeah... I guess if you strap on the accoustic and lightly play the piano, it makes it critically acclaimed.  The one Time critic said it was good the producer made Paul go solo on it.  I think there should be more Abe Laboriel and Rusty Anderson....<br /><br />I guess I sum it up this way... after hearing \\"Jenny Wren\\" and \\"English Tea,\\" it makes me wonder if we have another Paul imposter (ala a second \\"Paul is Dead\\" myth).... Because I can't see how these songs came from the same guy who did \\"Rinse the Raindrops,\\" \\"Hi, Hi, Hi,\\" and \\"Silly Love Songs.\\"
0634086782|5.0|this book is very very down to earth. i've seen many theory books and have recieved quite a few desk copies. most theory books give me the hives. they seem very far away from 'the music'. this book is right in there. talks about piano voicings for non-piano players, a section on improv. everything seems like stuff you can teach, students can learn, and everyone can apply directly to the music. which is what most of us want the book for, right? <br /> <br />tony miceli
B00005JM8V|4.0|Because of the sheer length of this documentary and the number of topics covered, it's hard to pin down an exact analysis of it, since so much is going on.  I agree this is a historically important documentary, with many powerful scenes, both during interviews and just during scenes when the camera is wordlessly panning over what remains of the camps today.  Although it would be too easy and simplistic to just automatically give this a 5-star review and say it's the best most authorative film on the Shoah ever made.  This by no means covers nearly everything that happened during the Shoah, even in its massive length of nine and a half hours.  About the last hour is devoted to just the Warsaw Ghetto and the uprising, but apart from that the ghettoes aren't covered.  What this documentary does cover are five of the six Vernichtungslageren (annihiliation camps) in Poland--Treblinka, Sobib&oacute;r, Belzec, Chelmno, and Oswiecim (Auschwitz), and what happened to the people on their way there in the death wagons.  There are interviews with people on all sides--survivors (including the only two survivors of Chelmno, Simon Srebnik and Michael Podchlebnik), ghetto guards and bureaucrats, people who ran the camps (particularly Franz Suchomel of Treblinka), villagers who watched the death wagons coming and going (their reactions to these peoples' fate and what they claim to have done for them seems mixed), the survivors themselves, and the Polish diplomat Jan Karski, who had begged the world to stop the genocide he knew very well was going on.  Among the survivors interviewed was Rudolf Vrba, one of my heroes, who escaped Oswiecim on 7 April 1944 along with his friend Alfred Wetzler to try to warn the world about what was being planned for Hungarian Jewry.  Another big plus supporting this documentary is that it was made in 1985, when there were more survivors around, and most of them were younger than they are today.  And though some people might be turned off by how much of the film is in subtitles, I enjoyed hearing all of that German, French, Italian, Polish, and Hebrew, and felt my own listening comprehension of German vastly improving as the film wore on, at times barely needing the subtitles.<br /><br />All of that said, this film at times feels like it overshot the mark, since it covers so much ground even within that specific topic of the extermination camps in Poland, and yet doesn't really seem to be very structured.  Many times this documentary has a very nonlinear feel and composition, which at one level works since when dealing with something like the Shoah, all concepts of time and place really did become unimportant and nonlinear, but even so, it can also have the feeling of just jumping back and forth between interviews and footage.  For example, we return to several interviews a number of times after having had long stretches in between covering other things.  There were also some segments that could have been cut and didn't really belong there, like the dancing couple in the German nightclub.  For the entire documentary, information is merely being presented; no conclusions are drawn, no analyses made, no archival footage used.  Some people might feel this is just as appropriate a technique as having such a nonlinear structure, but after finding out what Ron Rosenbaum has to say about Monsieur Lanzmann in the book 'Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil,' one is led to question why he used some of these techniques and why he doesn't feel there should be any analysis of the Shoah, no attempt to explain why these awful things happened or account for the great evil that took place, as though accounting for it somehow justifies it.<br /><br />Certainly this is an important film everyone should see at least once, but some of the effect is lessened by the lack of archival footage, the nonlinear structure and layout, and the refusal to draw any conclusions, make any analyses, provide any historical background for why these events were set in motion in the first place.  It's an important film about the Shoah, but by no means the most important one or the most authoritative one ever made.  The price also seems a little hefty; is it because of this film's huge reputation that it costs much more than most other four-disc sets?for why these events were set in motion in the first place.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is one of those rare programs that harken back to groundbreaking shows like Hill Street Blues.  As the viewer shifts his focus, new and wonderful avenues of exploration are brought to the fore. Each episode has a clear and complete plot line that at once satifies our desire for a well told story, and at the same time leaves the viewer yearning for more as new questions and character developments weave in and out of the narrative.  This is a must see series.
B000A3DFZE|2.0|Diet pop corn is the best way to describe this CD. It has nothing sweet sounding, is made from hot air and is corny. It's almost like Clapton is the Saturday morning cartoon version of himself. I understand the song subjects are important to him, but it's tiresome and boring and is not worthy of such a legend. The first song on the disc (So Tired) pretty much sums up the rest of the CD. Either he's tired or just damn lazy. If this were a James Taylor album I would say it's pretty good. But as an Eric Clapton album it blows.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|My CD collection heavily tends to the Prog Rock genre but I do have what I like to call a sizeable \\"Melody Section\\". By that I mean songs whose main purpose is to play a melody instead of exploring a melody like so many Prog bands like to do.  <br />When I first sampled Say You Will I was completely sold. What a rare event.  <br />I'm usually very critical of what I hear and hardly ever fall for a song the first time I hear it. But this album did it.  <br />Not all of it, of course, but 11 of the 18 the songs just have me floating every time I hear them.  <br />Aboslutely superb!  <br />I've never been much of a F Mac fan until I heard this album, and thanks to it I was able to discover anew the beauty from many of their old songs.  <br />How I wish I could thank them personally for it.  <br />
B000063V8U|5.0|If you've been getting all the Next Generation box sets, there's no reason to stop now.  Season Six pretty much fires on all cylinders, presenting lots of compelling episodes, a handful of entertaining two-parters (I particularly enjoyed the \\"Chain of Command\\" two-parter, where Ronny Cox replaces Picard as captain and starts slapping around the crew with his own version of tough love), and a minimum of soapiness.  You also get two great bookends to the season: the return of Scotty to the Trek universe near the start of the set and the action-packed return of the Borg (well, a slightly banged-up Borg splinter group, at any rate) at season's end.  The extras are once again generous, interesting, and well-organized.
B000002LE6|4.0|I didn't realized that the cd tracks are not separated, so you either have to listen to it in etirety or fast forward between songs.
B000AL730O|3.0|I've noticed that this CD is getting 5 stars or 1 star - thus I am guessing most people either love it or hate it.  <br />Let me preface by saying I am a dyed in the wool McCartney fan and own all the Beatles stuff together and solo. <br /> <br />On first listen, I thought this album was awful - boring as some other reviewers have stated. I didn't really like \\"Driving Rain\\" that much and was hoping for another \\"Flaming Pie\\". I was disappointed as this album didn't reach out and grab me - it was just there.  So, I gave it to a number of other people to listen to (not real Beatle fans, but people who know good music) - I figured I wouldn't miss it for a few days. Well, the response from everyone was that the CD is outstanding.  I decided to give it another \\"proper\\" listen - no distractions, just me and the CD, like the old days (and maybe a bit o' Jack and Coke).  <br /> <br />So, I must say, I've changed my initial view. This CD is GOOD - not the best, but certainly not the worst. The production, while sparse, is outstanding, and the music has all the late Beatles trademarks. Paul's voice is bad? Well, \\"English Tea\\" has the same voice as \\"Lovely Rita\\", another song could have been taken straight from \\"Abbey Road\\" - certainly the voice is aged, but it's still the voice we all know and love. Most of these tunes would have easily fit on the \\"White Album\\" or \\"Abbey Road\\" especially with a bit of tweaking by John, not much tweaking mind you. Is the \\"White Album\\" great? Of course I think so, but in 1968 it would have taken a lot of getting used to. Come on, \\"Piggies\\", \\"Don't Pass Me By\\", not to mention \\"Revolution 9\\"... Is it \\"Band on the Run\\", \\"Ram\\" or \\"McCartney\\"? No, but remember the gems \\"3 Legs\\", \\"Teddy Boy\\", \\"Junk\\"? All songs I like, but I'm sure the general public wondered what was up.  <br /> <br />In conclusion, McCartney has changed since Linda's death. He's who he is now, and it's obvious he's the same guy who penned and sang some of our most favorite later Beatles tunes. If you are a McCartney fan, you may need to warm up to this CD - if you are a casual listener I think you'll find this CD a great addition to your collection. If this is your first McCartney purchase, I'd suggest \\"Tug of War\\", \\"Flaming Pie\\", or \\"Wingspan\\"\\" as a better introduction.  <br />
B000244FDW|5.0|We have loved the tape version of this show for many years. The color was beginning to fade. Now we have the DVD - the color is back and to our pleasant surprise there are quite a few extra scenes not contained on the tape. These bridging scenes add a lot to the show.
B00080ZG10|2.0|How could Scorsese have messed up the story of HH so badly with this banal, cliche-ridden film, a supposedly accurate portrayal of HH?  Well, he did and he failed at it with Leonardo DeCaprio trying with all his might to look and act like HH.  But DiCaprio is not and could never look like, talk like or be HH...his round angular features and adolescent voice remind one of a teenage wannabe not HH, the aviator.  His scenes with Cate Blanchette as Hepburn are utterly laughable...a male teen fooling around with a woman.      But why would Scorsese subject his fans to this poorly written and hardly credible life story of Hughes?  When it's finally over, we care nothing about the characters, and we have been given a completely false version of historical events surrounding the Senate investigation.  If it's rewriting history that audiences want, why not just get Michael Moore to compile phoney footage?  Why wade through fancy sets and great costumes for what?  Nothing much here folks.  A shame.  HH was a fascinating man and Scorsese has made molehill out of a mountain.

B0007Y08IS|2.0|The first half hour of the first South Park movie was one of the funniest half hours I have ever seen on film.  It had me laughing so hard I hurt my ribs.  Team America had a lot to live up to.<br /><br />There are some big laughs in this one too.  The single funniest laugh is during a love scene between two of the Team America members, where these puppets are doing everything to each other short of getting out the whips and chains.  At first the scene is just funny, but then it gets so stupid and hysterical.  I'm not going to tell you what they do to each other.<br /><br />It has to be difficult to maintain the energy and humor over a full length movie.  The first South Park movie couldn't do it, but gave us an amazing beginning.  This movie doesn't rise to those heights, ever.  Despite having maybe about a dozen really funny parts in it, it really didn't keep me entertained enough to give it a rave review.<br /><br />One thing I give it credit for is being completely \\"politically incorrect\\".  It is the most right wing comedy ever made, and any reviewer who claims otherwise is lying.  To say that this is even handed or middle of the road is just a flat out lie.  It is as right wing as it can be, to the point of ridiculing every left wing actor they can think of and describing them all as fags.  This movie is Newt Gingrich on ecstasy.<br /><br />I don't care.  Comedies are supposed to make you laugh, so who cares what political position they take.  It had me laughing out loud a bunch of times, but overall I can't really give it more than about 2 stars.  Maybe 2 1/2.
B000053VAZ|4.0|I LOVE this movie.  It is a different type of story for sure, but in a refreshing way.  Johnny Depp does a blow-out job of Buster Keaton style comedy in this movie playing Sam, a cousin of a friend who comes to live with Benny and Joon.  He is funny, sensitive, serious, and courageous.  Mary Stuart Masterson does a fabulous job of playing Joon.  Mr. Quinn does a great job of playing the big brother.   <br /> <br />My son, who is 11, watched this with us and he laughed so hard at Sam's antics that he couldn't catch his breath.  He giggled throughout the entire movie. There is a love scene which in my opinion is tastefully done.  There is some language and ludicrous gambling.   <br /> <br />Three thumbs up!
B0007P3582|1.0|The only reason I'm giving this album a 1 is because dre makes some nasty beats, I personally like to hear songs that have more depth to them than money, sex, cars, and drugs.  If you like 50 cent then you've obviously never listened to anybody good.  If you want a good cd that's new buy the new Common album. Kanye makes the beats and Common knows how to rhyme.
0345451325|5.0|Awesome story.  I like reading about the Master Chief's beginnings. Reading the book allows you to get inside his head, in a way the video game can't.  To see his feelings, it gave me a new respect for the chief.
B000001EXR|4.0|Figures I'm nearly a hundred reviews down the road. Who will read this? Let's discuss KISS's music quickly. <br />Known for their melodic song writing, their sense of humor, their love of girls, and (most of the time) their sincerity. <br />This album is galaxies beyond all of that. And, to me, in a good way. Strangely, they sound like they're trying to be as angry as all the current groups are today. But with their musical maturity, it seemed like they had found a new niche. Then those pussies who they don't even have anymore - Peter Criss and Ace Frehley - couldn't even hack being in the group anymore - came back to ruin their progression. Kulick, I'm thinking of you, man. <br />The pussies' complaints were about Gene's and Paul's control over the band. Strange. When did Ace and Peter ever have ANY control? Never. That's right. But I guess Gene got his millions. Lucky guy. Anyway, if you need a description of the music on this record, think...WOW!!! Imagine music simlar to one of those giant tunnel-digging drills, combined with rocket launch noise, street jackhammers and Gene and Paul singing over it.I love this record! Every time I listen to it I think, \\"I love Kiss, why didn't they put out many records like this one?\\" If they did I would wear a KIss t-shirt!
B0009MDPYM|4.0|Keanu Reeves redeems his repuatation, and gives a memorable performance with his portrayal of exorcist John Constantine, who makes sure that the demons in Hell, and the angles stay in Heaven. Rachel Weisz co stars as Angela Dawson a , how can i word this, customer of Constantine, whose twin sister commited suicide, and wants to find out the truth behind her sister's death.  <br />  The movie will keep you entertained right from the beginning exorcism scene, where COnstantine delivers what I consider a memorable line-\\"This is Constantine. John Constantine. A**hole.\\"  <br />   Reeve's portrayal Constantine is very good, despite being different from the actual character from the Vertigo comic series. Weisz's performace is very good, her best since \\"Runaway Jury\\". <br />The special effects are very good. The fight/ battle sequences are well choreographed, and I can safely say that \\"Constantine\\" has a very different and interesting incarnation of Hell- a highway that looks like an atomic bomb was detonated there, rather than the standard firey cave. <br />The movie is very well done, and is Reeve's best since 1999's \\"The Matrix\\". If you are looking for an anti hero, or a good movie to watch on a Saturday night, then \\"Constantine\\" is it.
B000641ZA4|4.0|Genesis The Video Show is a good document of a once great band. The low budget films from the early Phil years are mostly of the band performing in various locations from sound stages, empty concert halls and broom closets. Robbery Assault and Battery is even acted out by the band.    After Abacab, the videos are more professional.  Land of Confusion is probably their best. It's an all-puppet lambasting of Ronnie and Nancy Reagan. Look for second Phil on harmonies and puppet Tony playing a cash register.    For some reason several videos from the poorly-received Calling All Stations were made. Although they are professionally produced, they cannot help these duds. By this time Genesis were only Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford (augmented by two or three unknowns).    There are a few annoying things about this DVD: The songs aren't in any discernable order; there is no bonus material; there are no videos with Peter Gabriel (Carpet Crawlers 1999 doesn't show any band members at the time). But the price is very reasonable for what you get.    [DW]
B000AU9UYM|5.0|The smash hit of 2005, and truely the best movie of 2005, \\"Batman Begins\\" is not a disapointment to comic book fans, and movie fans.  Christian Bale is Bruce Wayne, a Gotham City socalite, and orphan when his parents are murdered right in front of him. Wayne goes soul searching in the Himalayas, and learns the ways of the League of Shadows, a secret ban of ninjas. After, Wayne uses the skills he learned to fight crime and clean up the scum that runs rampant in Gotham.    Morgan Freeman costrats as Lucios Fox, the technicion that supplys Wayne with all his gadgets that make up the Batman suit. Michael Cain costars as Bruce Wayne's trusty butler Alfred Pennyworth, and Cicilian Murphy gives a chilling performance as Dr Crane, aka Scarecrow.    Christian Bale's portrayal of Batman in this movie is as definitive as Christopher Reeve's performance of Superman. Bale had the charisma of Bruce Wayne, and the darkness of Bruce Wayne as well. I will also say that this is Bale's best performance since \\"American Psycho\\"  To classify this as a comic book movie would be wrong. It is actually a realistic view of what Batman would be like in today's world. So do not expect this to be like \\"Sin City\\",\\"Superman III\\", or any campy lines and over the top fight scenes. Expect fight scenes like in \\"Walking Tall\\", or \\"Lethal Weapon\\".    The extras are very good.There is a short on the incarnations of Batman from the late 80s till now, a short on how they designed the costume, a feature on the Batmoble in the movie, a feature on making the movie, theatrical trailer, and a photo galary as well.    Overall, \\"Batman Begins\\" will not dissapoint. It will gain new fans, and win back old fans who were turned away with the turd sandwich that was \\"Batman & Robin\\".
B000096I9G|3.0|Like other fans, I grew up listening to The Cure, most of there songs/albums reflect time periods in my life.  I thought this concert was well done for being live.  Video is excellent, sound quality is good but the way they recorded the individual band accoustic volume levels needed work.  There are many songs as you know where Robert Smith's guitar should be more distinct or louder than the others.  Each band member seemed to drown eachother out to create a loud mess of guitars playing at the same audio level.  \\"Same deep water as you\\" and \\"Plain Song\\"  are a perfect exsample of this.   All in all, still a good DVD to purchase.
B00079FUI6|5.0|I'm a HUGE fan of Desperate Housewives and I think that this is one of the best television shows ever made.  The writing is fantastic, the acting is superb and the music is perfect.  This is everything one could ever want in a tv show, drama, comedy, and heart.  With the main characters being so different from each other there is at least one that everyone can relate to. Bree: the perfect housewife, Lynette: the down to earth mother, Gabrielle: the trophy wife, Edie: the vamp, and Susan, the ditsy, single mom. <br />This show represents so many types of real families today, I think Lynette's family is most representative of most families today.  However, there are many that are so much like the other women.  Bree appears to have the perfect life, the perfect family, the perfect house, the perfect garden, etc.  But behind closed doors we see how life is never as perfect as it may seem.  Gabrielle, the wife who's desperate to get the attention from her over worked husband.  Susan, the single mom who tries to get back in the dating world.  It's a very empowering show for women and a show that all of America should be proud of. <br /> <br />I'm so anxious to pick up this DVD tomorrow, it's been the most anticipated DVD I've wanted to get since the show's premiere!
B000002L5I|5.0|I think KWS has a wonderful gift of playing the blues with passion and intensity. No he is not Stevie Ray and how in the hell are you going to say he sucks because he isn't? And Stevie Ray is no John Petrucci or Al Dimeaola so I guess he sucks as well. Come on people, stop being such music snobs. I highly recommend it.
B0004Z33G4|3.0|The Rambo movies are great. I just finished watching them for the first time, and they are very entertaining, solid movies. However, this DVD release looks like it was just slapped together. <br /> <br />First, there are no subtitles of any sort in any of the three films. These would be especially helpful, as Rambo isn't exactly the king of enunciation. Some of the dialogue is very hard to understand, even after backing up repeatedly. <br /> <br />The vaunted \\"Survival Mode\\" isn't that great either. The only good feature is the \\"MetaScope,\\" which gives background to aspects of the film, such as foreign cultures and Rambo's equipment. All the other \\"Meta-\\" enhancements are extremely dull. <br /> <br />The bonus features consist of audio commentaries and deletetd scenes. The deleted scenes are pretty interesting, but of poor visual quality. I haven't listened to the commentaries. <br /> <br />I tried to watch these on my computer, and while it worked somewhat, there were problems. The discs lock up your computer for about 30 seconds just to ask whether to install extra features or play normally. The first two movies worked, but Rambo III crashed Windows Media Player and then, when I tried a second time, played the movie like it was some sort of slide show - a motion picture without the motion. <br /> <br />I watched Rambo III on a set-top DVD player after that, and it mostly worked; at 58:49, though, the movie freezes for a few seconds, then skips those few seconds. The DVD player also made weird, loud mechanical noises during this time. This sort of thing shouldn't happen with DVDs. <br /> <br />This set wasn't put together very well, from the simple three-DVD-cases-in-a-box packaging to the playback problems to the lackluster features and bonus materials.
B000AL730O|5.0|Some might consider this \\"McCartney III,\\" because although Paul doesn't play all of the instruments on this album, he does play most of them. But Chaos & Creation is really the third (and best) in the \\"McCartney\\" series mostly because it's a very intimate work. We get a sense here that this is the real McCartney, up close and personal, not so much Sir Paul the entertainer.     And I say it's about time that Paul made a record that really matters, an album that connects to his listeners on an emotional level. It's a quiet, understated record exploring inner terrain in the same way as Bob Dylan's Time Out of Mind. Like Dylan and all the other rockers of his generation, Paul has aged. But like Dylan on that wonderful TOOM album, Paul is showing here that he's come to terms with his aging, and the wisdom that it brings. Too many people (to borrow a Paul phrase) have stopped taking Macca seriously as a great artist. This album reminds us that Paul wrote some of the great melancholy and reflective songs of the Beatles: Yesterday, I'll Follow the Sun, For No One, Eleanor Rigby, She's Leaving Home, Mother Nature's Son, Long & Winding Road. Most of Chaos & Creation has that kind of melancholy feeling. It's not a grandiose rock/pop album made for stadium/arena performance. Rather, this is a record for listening at home when one has the time to absorb the melodic beauty, harmonic brilliance, and lyrical sincerity of the songs.     This record is not perfect. First, many will miss Paul's more humorous, rocking side that albums like Band on the Run offer in abundance. Chaos & Creation is not a balanced album in that regard, it's certainly tilted to the quiet and reflective side. Secondly, there are a couple of clunkers like \\"Too Much Rain\\" that simply don't hold up. But the rest of the album is original and challenging for McCartney. Obviously, Nigel Godrich did a great job in pulling Macca out of himself to get the most inspired performances and writing on tape.    Fine Line isa strong opener, the most upbeat rocker on the album, yet with a surprising lyrical perspective...Macca is talking to a male friend, a brother, who has gone astray. The chord progression has an oddly engaging dissonance, very intriguing and catchy, and it gets under your skin right away. How Kind of You is unsettling in its emotional frankness. I've rarely heard Paul this self-effacing, and it's a refreshing revelation. The melody matches the yearning quality of the lyrics. Jenny Wren, At the Mercy, two more masterworks. Jenny Wren has the delicate acoustic finger-picking style of Blackbird and Mother Nature's Son, with an equally poignant lyric about a heartbroken girl. At the Mercy is one of the sadder songs on the album, with a deeply haunting melody that darkly mirrors its bleak world view.     Then comes a true delight! Friends to Go was apparently written as a tribute to George Harrison, and how wonderful a tribute it is! Paul captures the bouncy harmonic style of George in the music, but even more fittingly, Paul evokes George's shy, self-effacing nature in the lyrics. This is perhaps the most knowing tribute that Paul or anyone could have conceived for George, because it's exactly the kind of song that George himself would write--although Paul pulls it off without sounding like he's imitating George. One of the loveliest Macca songs ever, and one of the highlights of the album. My eyes have welled with tears a few times already, hearing this and picturing George. The two men had their quarrels, but they were brothers who grew up together under the public glare of Beatlemania, and Paul shows just how much he loved George, and also how much he understood George's musical and personal style, by writing this song. Very moving in a subtle way.     Speaking of his former bandmates, Riding to Vanity Fair is Lennon-esque in its raw emotional bitterness, and it actually reminds me of Lennon's anti-Paul tirade, How Do You Sleep, with less of the sardonic venom, but with the same core of hurt. Vanity Fair is one of the most surprising McCartney songs. I've rarely heard Paul communicate with such open invective. The music has a brooding quality, with the hushed intensity of the strings and the haunting tinkling of the glockenspiel, that conveys the tortured emotion. Lyrically, Paul is bidding good riddance to a friend who has betrayed him and hurt him deeply. How refreshing to know that Macca still has such surprises within him as a writer.     The final two tracks are less melancholy, but more focused on the lush romanticism that Paul thrives upon, with stunningly gorgeous melodies, and heartfelt lyrics. This Never Happened Before is probably the loveliest melody on the entire album, a piano-driven chord progression that is right up there alongside Here There & Everywhere or Maybe I'm Amazed for its pure unadulterated beauty. This is a classic McCartney love ballad in every sense, with all of the good qualities and none of the drawbacks. Macca said he \\"loaned it out\\" to a couple getting married, and that makes sense: it's an ideal wedding song, as heavenly as it gets. The closing track, Anyway, is also a love song, with a darker melodic feel than the previous song, and with yearning lyrics and vocals to match the music. It's a great closer for the album, because it leaves an open door, an unanswered question. It reminds me, in fact, of the closing track on Ram, Back Seat of My Car, in the grandeur of the melody and the wistful romanticism of the lyrics.     A very thought-provoking album, in fact the most challenging album of Macca's entire solo career. It's not a \\"rock\\" album, but it is the most heartfelt collection of songs Paul has ever squeezed onto one album since the Beatles--quite an achievement. At this stage of his career, when many of us thought Paul was an afterthought, this is one hell of a comeback, another similarity to Dylan's Time Out of Mind. And like that album, Paul deserves a Grammy for this.
B000063JZQ|5.0|A flop in its day, Polanski's The Tragedy of MacBeth now looks more and more like one of his finest achievements. Unlike many Shakespeare adaptations, Polanski opts for clarity and accessibility rather than elocutionary gymnastics, providing a brisk narrative and staging it with a real cinematic imagination that prevents it from ever becoming stage bound. It's set in a believable, gritty world where the setting sun makes the very sands look bathed in blood and overcast skies and harsh elements provide an appropriate setting for betrayal and violence - LOTS of violence. Despite moments of black humor, it's pretty obvious what Polanski is trying to get out of his system in scenes of brutal murder or the ripping of MacDuff from his mother's womb. Francesca Annis doesn't quite scale the heights of madness as Lady MacBeth, but Jon Finch and Martin Shaw do well by MacBeth and Banquo and the supporting performances are pleasingly naturalistic. The use of location is excellent and well-served by Gilbert Taylor's Scope photography, while Third Eye Blind's scoring is surprisingly apt. Definitely one of the best Shakespeare screen adaptations, and a real movie as well.

0790729407|5.0|Michael Cimino was one of many who tried to bring the story of Irish revolutionary Michael Collins to the screen and on the evidence of the mess he made of Salvatore HGiuliano's story in The Siclian (and the bizarre gay love triangle in his proposed version) it's a good job he didn't. Kevin Costner's attempts resulted in some equally simplistic scripts that enshrined cliche over history before Warners decided to drop his version in favor of Neil Jordan's long-planned film. Even if they were motivated more by the success of Interview With the Vampire than the material, they made the right choice: Michael Collins is easily one of Jordan's very best films and a strikingly intelligent piece of political cinema. There are changes for dramatic purposes, but these generally seem made for sound reasons and don't change the essential truth of the Irish Republican hero who became a scapegoat for de Valera's failure to gain a Republic and ended up being assassinated by his former colleagues in Ireland's forgotten and bloody civil war.  <br /> <br />Clocking in at little over 130 minutes, Jordan keeps a sense of momentum that occasionally loses the odd detail that would be helpful to audiences unfamiliar with Irish history (such as the way the popular hatred towards the rebels who fought in the Easter Rising was turned around by the disastrous decision of the British to execute its leaders) but which still manages to find room for character as well, personalizing the tragedy surprisingly effectively. One of the last historical epics to use real sets and real extras instead of CGI, the film feels grounded in reality while still being an enthralling and cinematic political thriller. Sinead O'Connor's screaming over the assassination scene is unhelpful, but even that can't destroy the film. <br /> <br />Keeping his promise to cast Liam Neeson despite heavy lobbying from Michael Collins lookalike Kenneth Branagh (who lacks the presence necessary for the part), Jordan gets good rather than great performances from his leads, although Alan Rickman nails de Valera's  reptilian and hesitant delivery and Ian Hart impresses as one of Collins' lieutenants. The unwelcome presence of Julia Roberts threatens to turn the film into Hollywood but thankfully her extremely limited abilities aren't stretched to breaking point. Probably the only film about the IRA that protestants and Brits can see without bringing Molotov cocktails to the cinema, it's release fell foul of America's constant denial of the complexities of the situation, Ireland's denial of the civil war and the rest of the world's horror at the IRA breaking their ceasefire without warning and killing a little girl in the process. Rarely revived, it's definitely worth rediscovering. <br /> <br />The DVD comes with an excellent South Bank Show that fills in many of the film's historical gaps, including archive footage of Collins himself (who really was a dead ringer for Branagh), although it is irritatingly a flipper disc. <br /> <br />
B0002858YS|3.0|I think The Killers are a good band. They write very good songs and I like fresh sound on this record. But I must say that  <br /> <br />THE DRUMMER IS HORRID! <br /> <br />I actively dislike him for spoiling this album for me:-) Ronald's drum sequences somehow really bug me. Hello guys - get a new drummer! Maybe Interpol can lend you theirs. I dislike trashing records but I feel that here I am just giving a good advice. The Truth Must Be Told;-)
B0002KVULG|4.0|There's more than just a touch of disco to Frank Langella's costumes in John Badham's 1979 Dracula, and along with the copious amounts of dry ice accompanying his seductions and a Maurice Binder laser light love scene it occasionally hovers on the edge of turning into Saturday Bite Fever. But this is more of a lavishly mounted old-school interpretation, with W.D. Richter's screenplay reworking both the novel and the stage play to interesting effect: the film is set entirely in England, bracketed by two violent scenes at sea, and Dracula here is more of a serial seducer than a creature of the night. But by emphasizing the Byronic seductiveness of the role there's never an real sense of menace or threat: this Dracula is more like that smooth git who steals your girlfriend at a nightclub than the embodiment of evil, and it's only in the snarling violence of the finale that you get a sense of the animal beneath. That the forces of good are such a lifeless lot doesn't help much either: Laurence Olivier isn't quite as embarrassingly OTT as my memory had him, and Donald Pleasance's habit of eating in his every scene isn't as tiresome on the small screen as the large, but along with Trevor Eve's ey-upp lad northern lawyer type Jonathan Harker they don't exactly have you cheering them on. But despite the problems, the films is full of great little moments, such as the Count clawing away at the putty in a window to get to his first victim, boasts beautiful production design (the shipwreck and Carfax Abbey are particularly impressive) and has a wonderful romantic score by John Williams. The eagle-eyed will spot future Doctor Who and holder of the Guinness World Record for stuffing live ferrets down his trousers (it's genuine: look it up) Sylvester McCoy in a cough-and-a-spit part.    Sadly, the transfer on both Universal's DVD and their subsequent Blu-ray release loses the rich colour of the theatrical release for the prefered desaturated near-black and white look Badham originally wanted - one of those occasions where you can't help but agree with the studio, I'm afraid. Boosting the colour controls on your TV won't help either: parts of the film, like the establishing shot of Whitby Harbour, have no colour at all to boost, and the desaturation has been accompanied by a lack of background detail. The retrospective documentary on the Region 1 NTSC DVD and region-free Blu-ray is interesting and informative, but the photo gallery is poorly presented and the absence of the original trailer is disappointing.
B0009R1T7M|4.0|You really need to hear this album and listen to it because I think is beyond description.  I am half way through it and don'tknow if I should delete it or keep it.  It's sort of like chill out music for 4-6 yo kids at reccess,   It's unique =ness will definately bring me back.
1400032717|4.0|I read this book along with a few others I'd been hearing about, and I want to say that though I enjoyed Christopher's tale, and his strange world, and his unusual charm, I can't see why all the fuss...It's a good story for what it is, but it certainly didn't seem great  to me.     I gave it a high rating because I felt I learned a few things about autism and how those who are identified as such see the world around them. I also enjoyed the scenes with his father--and the way they expressed affection. All of this was eye-opening to me and for that, I can say I learned something new (and I'm all of 52 years old!).
B000002I4W|2.0|Yes I have on my night table \\"kind of blue\\" and \\"Giant steps\\" and \\"Chet\\"..... yes I am a \\"jazz nut\\".. but inspite of having listened at least 20 times to this CD, I just can't \\"get it\\"... I am giving it 2 stars as there is NO doubt of its historical value.. but I can't say that I really enjoy listening to this album.....  I will try again in a few years........ Again this is only my opinion so maybe I am ( and probably am) wrong!!!    April 2007; 2 years later I realize now that this is a fantastic album. I just needed to train my ears!5 stars!!!!!!!!
B00004XONN|5.0|First off, let me say that this review is from an unbiased point of view due to the fact I had never heard much (if any) Radiohead before purchasing this album. I listen to all kinds of rock music ranging from The Beatles to Metallica, and Radiohead has quickly become one of my favorite bands. Their sound is very unique and atmospheric, so it certainly won't be every casual listener's cup of tea. However, if you can allow yourself a straight listen through of Kid A or OK Computer in one sitting, the scope, imagination, and depth of sound will make you lost within the music. It is a truly amazing experience. I didn't know what to expect when I bought this album, and although strange at first, the strength of the music (just like any other great band) shines right through. The vocals are also very fitting and interesting. If you buy this album and listen to it with an open mind, I put my money down that you will enjoy it (and maybe even come to love it). I hope so, because I know I sure did.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I listened to Parachutes and A Rush of Blood to the Head. They were both good, but they were for someone who enjoyed softer, mellow kind of music. But X & Y is nothing like them.  <br />This album had a more louder, livelier vibe than their two other siblings. White Shadows has a beat that will be replayed in your head over and over. With its fantastic lyrics that move wonderfully with the music, it is one of my personal favorites. <br />I absolutely adore this cd. However, I would never recommend to just anyone. Rockers, actual rockers, will not find the music aggressive enough or the lyrics satisfying to their ultimate taste. I think this cd is for those who enjoy Indie-Rock. It has the rock vibe, but is a bit toned down from loud music with blaring voices that The Hives or The Strokes ;) present. The lyrics are sung in a clear and wonderful tone with great guitar of all kinds, including electric, bass, acoustic, etc.  <br />Coldplay has songs that are meaningful. Their previous two albums have great lyrics and the here or there good, 'rockish' type music. This album shows Coldplay has really come through and learned how to hone their skills to produce a good cd with great music and lyrics.  <br />Music we all need: <br />Franz Ferdinand <br />Saybia <br />Keane <br />
B0009XT8YW|5.0|This album was one of her best and still sounds great after all of these  years.   I enjoyed the interview on the dvd side.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|Gorgeous women! Beautiful music!  We listen to it almost every day and never get tired of it.  If you like Enya, you'll love this.
B00005JNTX|5.0|There are no words to describe how happy I was, after seeing this film. There are no stuipid love triangles and no friggin P.C. casting, character creation or issues. There's tons of wonderful violence and super hot babes. This is just what the movie industry needed.
B00004XONN|5.0|The musical evolution that occurred over Radiohead's first four records culminated with 2000's \\"Kid A.\\" After debuting with the lo-fi indie-rock of 1993's \\"Pablo Honey,\\" Radiohead metamorphosed from polished, melodic alternative rock (1995's \\"The Bends\\") into commercially viable progressive rock (1997's \\"OK Computer\\") before arriving at \\"Kid A,\\" uncompromising art rock almost completely stripped of mainstream sensibilities.  Trace the similar progress of the earliest Yes and Genesis records, and you'll easily see why Radiohead appeals to progressive rock fans. Radiohead perhaps forfeited short-term commercial success with \\"Kid A\\" (although it did debut on Billboard's charts at #1), but this record may stand the test of time better than any other Radiohead album.  Thirty years from now, music fans may speak of \\"Kid A\\" the way they now do about Yes' \\"Close to the Edge\\" or Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Kid A\\" represents a re-constructionist approach to rock.  Radiohead turns the idiom inside out without entirely eliminating the traditional elements of the rock band. Few songs on \\"Kid A\\" rely on conventional song structures; exceptions include the hard-rocking \\"The National Anthem\\" and the relatively accessible \\"Optimistic.\\"  \\"Kid A\\" undoubtedly demands repeated listening: first to scratch its icy surface, then to gain access to the labyrinths of sound that lie underneath.  The cover art brilliantly illustrates the record: ice-cold to the touch, \\"Kid A\\" burns with energizing fires within. <br /> <br />For all the precision of composition and performance, \\"Kid A\\" possesses the power to emotionally affect the listener. The ethereal \\"Everything In Its Right Place\\" opens the record with a palpable sense of excitement. Exhilaration sets in with \\"The National Anthem,\\" and segues into introspection with the dreamlike, Floydian strains of \\"How to Disappear Completely.\\"  \\"Idioteque\\" is imbued with apocalyptic fear, while \\"Morning Bell\\" delivers a feeling ofanxiety with its disconcerting 5/4 beat.  The record achieves a melancholic catharsis with the dirge-like finale, \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack.\\"   <br /> <br />Throughout \\"Kid A,\\" Radiohead expand their sonic palette with evocative synthesizers, vocal samples, experimental effects and drum loops. Amidst this varied tone color, Thom Yorke's plaintive, elastic falsetto is perhaps the most expressive instrument of all. <br /> <br />With \\"Kid A,\\" Radiohead has produced a work of imagination that extends and transcends the limitations of the rock genre.  This is an achievement of nearly unparalleled artistic integrity whose reputation is sure to grow with time.
0345440900|4.0|Being a first time Mum you soon realise that everybody you talk to is an 'expert' and apparently has the answers to all your 'problems'.  There is alot of myths and pressure out there to get it right. New mums don't want to be lectured they just want to be listened to and given understanding and options.  The baby whisperer helps to guide you on your way without dictating and making you feel clueless like so many other baby books do.  The best thing is the use of humour which made me laugh and see the lighter side of many of the situations I had found myself in with our precious little bundle. A great read that uses a gentle guiding hand instead of an over opinonated iron fist.
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|Ah, the Karate Kid.  This is the film that teaches us that when a bully won't leave you alone, the only way to solve the problem is to kick his ass in a karate tournament.  It introduced phrases into the American vocabulary, introduced us to Elizabeth Shue and made everyone attempt a crane kick at least once.  Now, you can view this film as kinda corny and watch it to snicker, but we all know that deep down this movie is actually very good.  Sure, the crane kick finale is a bit hokey, but doesn't your heart swell every time?  The sequels deserve any potshot you can take at them, but this was pretty cool stuff if you were young when it originally came out.  I remember everyone at school wanted to take karate after this film came out.  Ralph Macchio became a heart throb but went the way of Corey Haim after these films.  I did see him recently in an episode of The Outer Limits, so we know he's still alive and well.  My personal fave is Martin Kove as John Kreese.  Is this not the coolest performance?  Nothing like a crazed vet teaching the evil side of karate.  The whole \\"No Mercy!\\" philosophy is a hoot.  It seemed so overdone, but I'm sure there are men like Kreese out there who merely train boys to be bullies.  Morita of course does a wonderful job.  Where is Pat nowdays?  And of course, if you needed a jerk/bully in an 80s film, what better choice than Billy Zabka?  The always reliable Billy Zabka!  If you're a Zabka fanatic, you'll be happy to know his career lives on in Python and Python 2!  All in all, it's The Karate Kid-no fancy review needed, this movie sells itself.  There's about a half hour's worth of interviews with John Avildsen, writer Robert Kamen, Ralph Macchio, Pat Morita, Martin Kove, and of course, Billy Zabka(the amazing Billy Zabka)!!!!
B00005JNTX|1.0|Let me be straights, I liked \\"pulp fiction\\" it had a story to it.<br /><br />But, Sin City was nothing but gratuitous violence, bodies cut up, people tortured for no reason other than psychos wanted to. Beautiful sexy women turned on by blood and gore.  Sex, rape, murder, torture, cannibalism all glorified like these are the best ideas a person can have to make their life more meaningful.<br /><br />It should have been rated X, and the commercial should let you know how much nudity, blood, gore, sex, and violence is in the movie, instead of showing it as if it were artsy and clever.<br /><br />There is no story, or very little story. If it weren't for the constant violence the movie would be nothing but black and white boring depressive scenes. You feel no sympathy for any of the main characters through they certainly tried to make you feel sorry for them by beating them half to death.
B0000524CY|5.0|The epitome of classic horror. This motion picture was made at a time when the film industry still made horror for mature, thinking audiences. Gripping, overwhelming. To this day few films have matched it in being able to intelligently shock and disturb the viewer.<br /><br />There are many people who refuse to watch THE EXORCIST for religious reasons. They are cheating themselves. This film does not glorify evil. Rather it shows the Devil and his demons as prideful and arrogantly foolish (after all, wouldn't anyone or anything in rebellion against an omnipotent, omniscient God be arrogantly foolish?). The priests, Fr. Merrin and Fr. Karras, symbolize the Christian virtue of Faith triumphing over doubt and the ultimate expression of Faith, self-sacrifice.
B00005JNTX|3.0|Movie looked a lot better in the previews.  Was slow at times with not a ton of action and too much lovey dovey crap.
B000A3DFZE|5.0|a great contemporary recording of todays themes . As expected , I felt cheated when Eric and BB got together to do Covers , I expected the greats to come up with new and improved old blues ... Who cares about Slow Hand or 461 Ocean Blvd or Layla or Cream or Blues Breakers when it is already out there to savour and enjoy . We want New and Improved Old Blues , and this is what Back Home is all about , being awe ( respect combined with talent and wonder ) again by a classic musician and his electric and acoustic guitars ... Great Comeback ...
B000002KHH|5.0|The most versatile metal album ever created. OR the album that created metal, you take your pick.<br />Either way, PARANOID is a very well known and very well rounded album from my boys BLACK SABBATH.<br />It ain't my favorite because I've heard of albums like SABOTAGE that blow this thing out of the fire, but this album still ROCKS on its own right.<br /><br />WAR PIGS: is one of the most powerful songs of all time. Seriously, this song can do whatever it wants and get away with it.<br />PARANOID: If you don't know this song then you must stop reading this AND BUY THE ALBUM NOW!<br />PLANET CARAVAN: A moody, epic, atmospheric peice. Very nice.<br />IRON MAN: I HATE THIS SONG! WHAT?<br />ELECTRIC FUNERAL: Is a nasty metal song!<br />HAND OF DOOM: Is cool, it has the funky part and the metal part, very cool lyrics too.<br />RAT SALAD: Is a boogie like jam<br />FARIES WEAR BOOTS: Another well known. Good stuff.<br /><br />Theres no way you should be without this album, I'm pretty sure this was just issued to you upon junior high when I was a kid. WE sang Black Sabbath songs in the sandbox man.<br /><br />TODAYS LESSON: Push the needle in and face deaths sickly grin.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Nick from Louisville hit the nail on the head.  This album is a masterpiece.  If you love Britney Spears, please don't buy this album because you read about it in Rolling Stone then give it two stars.  It deserves five.   <br /> <br />This is an intense album and may not be as immediately accessable as the Bends, but like all great music, after ten listens you'll begin to see the beauty and majesty of this amazing work. You'll like it more after the twentieth listen that the first. It is not pop music.  It is musical art.  Don't bother comparing to anything (Pink Floyd?)... this is an original. <br /> <br />Flawless, beginnning to end.
B0000067L2|5.0|This is a great album. Cream had only three others, but none of them were as complete as this one. Nowadays you could just go with a greatest hits and get the goods from the other three albums but you WILL miss out on goods from this peice, cuz this album is complete. Not as straight up blues as FRESH CREAM, but this was 1967. You weren't allowed to release an album unless it was somewhat psychedelic. Well Cream answered the call mixing their blues with acid rock and a handful of EARLY HEAVY METAL...<br /><br />STRANGE BREW... Is a pretty tripped out song, I think its about dating a witch. Hah, tell me about it.<br /><br />SUNSHINE OF YOUR LOVE... Is the HIT.<br /><br />WORLD OF PAIN... Very trippy.<br /><br />TALES OF BRAVE... One of the first metal songs ever.It starts slow but these guitars really HEAT up.<br /><br />SWLABR: That actually stands for \\"she walks like a bearded rainbow,\\" I don't know if the songs supposed to be gay or what but its a very catchy tune. One of my favorites.<br /><br />Those are just my initial picks, the whole thing is good. If you just want SUNSHINE then maybe the greatest hits will be your route; I think you still get STRANGE BREW and BRAVE ULYSSES but you will miss out on other greats in exchange for crap songs like (crap) ANYONE FOR TENNIS.
B000ASATWQ|4.0|This album is indicative of the tremendous growth that Jr. Gong has experienced over the past ten years. in some ways it is a vindication for his hardwork and development since 1995 when he made his first and unfortunately, unfavourable appearance on the jamaican music scene for which he was critcised and his talents questioned. he has emerged so much stronger since then and is now getting his just rewards. this album is proof that he is one of the hardest reggae performers out there and of his immense talents. an incredibly well produced effort, it is reflective, exciting and uplifting from so many perspectives. for me the standout cut is  \\"we're gonna make it\\" which in many ways is the flip side of \\"welcome to jamrock.\\" where WTJ paints a grim and realistic picture of life in Kingston;s inner cities, the Jimmy Riley inspired track, presents a way out. a belief that despite it all there is STILL a light at the end of the tunnel. If WTJ speaks of lost youth led to criminal behaviour by political negligence and abuse, \\"we're gonna make it\\" shows that Junior Gong believes these youth can be saved. the key line is: 'Its not too Late..\\"  <br />The other tracks on the album display a coherence not found on his masterpiece, 'Halfway Tree \\" even if his lyrics are sometimes not as deeply personal as on 'still searchin,\\" 'stand a chance\\" etc.the incredible \\"road to zion\\" and both \\"Confrontation\\" and \\"Pimpa's Paradise,\\" illustrate why Junior Gong cannot be placed in a box. he is truly a gifted DJ and I hope that he continues on this path. he himself has recently stated that he now feels \\"very near to the beginning.\\" this is a truly great album that deserves a lot of attention. Onelove
B000002HJD|5.0|More than I expected anyway. I really like this CD. I actually owned it first on vinyl which I like even more sometimes.<br /><br />Strangely captivating and (for spoken word) surprisingly easy to listen to. This has greatly to do with all the little peices that go along with the spoken word.<br /><br />The original tape was just Jim and a bottle of booze reading his poetry into a mic. A few years after his death, the remaining DOORS recorded music to support the groove of the poetry.<br /><br />They actually spawned a single this way with GHOST SONG.<br /><br />Theres a lot of cut and paste here, and its very effective. Jim speaks to us through the left speaker, while a rare jim blues demo can be heard on the right. Stuff like this is very interesting. Also we get a complete live ROADHOUSE BLUES which opens up the second side.<br /><br />The poetry is good too. I didn't even know I liked it so much, although an avid DOORS fan. No, I really didn't think I was going to like this album, but it pulled me right in.<br /><br />Its the rawest version of a trip into JIM MORRISONS head your gonna get. The CD has bonus tracks too!
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Wow. Where to start! This is an amazing soundtrack, and is currently my favorite of all soundtracks I own (I own a lot). Howard Shore, although not very well known compared to John Williams, does just as good or even better than John does. The Symphony who plays this soundtrack are exeptionally well in tune(take it from a musician). My favorite tracks are:<br /><br />A Storm Is Coming<br /><br />The White Tree<br /><br />The Steward of Gondor<br /><br />The Black Gate Opens<br /><br />The End of All things<br /><br />The Return of the King<br /><br />Into the west<br /><br />The vocals are absolutely amazing. They hired the right people for the right singing parts.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you want mostly symphonic music, with a few songs with vocals, and want the best music ever, buy this CD.<br /><br />You won't regret it.
B000002KKK|5.0|The first couple of ZZ TOP albums don't impress me very much, and the ones that did them so well in the eighties don't impress me much either. Though all of the albums have at least one or two good tracks, I cannot recommend them as solid albums.<br /><br />THIS PEICE, is from 1979. They took about three years off after their highly succesful FANDANGO album before this one.<br /><br />I LOVE this album, when I think ZZ TOP, I think this album. It's got the sound that I listen to ZZ TOP for. This is the sound I expected to find in earlier releases but didn't. Its a real fuzzy, gritty, blues sound, which IS ALMOST BETTER on the next album after this EL LOCO, but slips into eighties madness after that.<br /><br />THIS and EL LOCO are the quintessential ZZ TOPs. The sound is everything I love in music, and the lyrical content (pretty much just about booze, broads, and being a bad ass) fits right along. Don't waste your money like I did on a greatest hits and span all the era's of ZZ TOP, the best days for these guys were between 1979 and 1981.<br />PICKS:<br />THANK YOU: Though it is almost like something that would be played at a wedding, the gritty production makes it cool.<br />BAD-NATIONWIDE: The best one here. Unstoppable lyrics (I had a fine fox in front, I had three more in the back...) I can't stop the grin!(THEY was smoking lucky strikes and wearin' nylons too!)<br />FOOL FOR HER STOCKINGS: more trash. YES<br />DUST MY BROOM: excellent blues cover<br />CHEAP SUNGLASSES: best bass solo around, funky riff peice<br /><br />EVERY TRACK IS A WINNER though so don't think thats all....<br /><br />A MUST HAVE!<br /><br />TODAYS LESSON: go out and get yourself some thick black frames.
B000000OQF|5.0|See how many people love this album? It's my favorite! Your gonna love it, so go out and buy it!

0385470819|1.0|I thought Grisham was an average writer who had gone down hill recently.  Then I tried this 500 page monstrosity.  I estimate that 75% of it is filler of the worst sort, banal and repetitive.
0060922583|5.0|As there have already been many reviews concerning the ideas advanced by Michael Talbot in his profoundly influential book The Holographic Universe, I want to refrain from reiterating them. Instead, I'll comment upon a number of reviews that only underline the continuing need for such books, and speak of those times when religion and science were virtually one and the same. The tales and memories of outrageous abuses committed in serving that worldview may be what continue to dissuade many scientists and realists from embracing a reinformed version of that genuinely troubled - and troubling - marriage.    Yet science has become, in so many ways, just another religion, choked off by the same dogma that holds our species hostage to a diminished, controlling idea of the reason for our being, Like religion, science is defined by a collection of beliefs that are substantiated within the context and boundaries of accepted understanding, failing to imagine that there are demonstrable answers and additional information to be had beyond them. But as with religion, science so often falls short because it cannot acknowledge the diversity of human - life - experience, that many outcomes cannot be repeated due to our beliefs affecting them, the most powerful notion that The Holographic Universe explores in every kind of light. This is also what allows joyless and dreary showmen such as James 'The Amazing' Randi to take advantage of similarly unquestioning skeptics, creating a cynical, self-fulfilling prophecy. It is truly terrifying to contemplate that others can exert such power over the direction of events in our lives as would a voodoo practitioner or kahuna (although both work in response to their victims' belief capacity) yet as with the clarity of purpose and direction that follows so many near-death experiences (including those of Talbot's) the awareness of this capability and how it relates to our true multidimensional nature (that, as the book suggests, of all matter) results in a self-policing sense of  responsibility that rarely falls prey to material need or weaknesses. The inherent (and somewhat irrational) fear of this demonstrates a distinct lack of faith in humankind's capacity to evolve.     What is faith? It is not another term for religion itself, but instead the spiritual maturing of a fundamental belief system, the butterfly of elegant understanding that emerges from a rough-hewn cocoon. More than anything else, spirituality is a recognition of relationships and interconnectedness, common origins in the energetic realm; faith, the belief that there are answers to every question posed, and that they are available to every person. Science also requires some faith, at least a belief, in the viability of a theory or hypothesis.  When what came to be modern science rose up during the Rennaissance as a reaction to an unenlightened Dark Age (yet not necessarily giving the lie to alchemy, a very misunderstood pursuit to this day) it was attended by curious, extraordinarily driven individuals such as Leonardo da Vinci, Galileo, Copernicus and even Sir Isaac Newton whose creative tendencies led them to rarely-visited paths of inquiry and what were then decidedly radical ideas. The atrophying of just such a creative process and the aforementioned fear of abuse is what prevents many of us from attending the remarriage of science and faith, failing to make the distinction between the latter and religion.     Nearly fifteen years ago, The Holographic Universe strongly suggested that marriage needn't forever be an unhappy one and can give life to a far richer view of just what Man and matter truly are, help us to visualize a more meaningful existence, seen through the eyes of both.

B000002OZY|4.0|I'm really not here to write a review of the music; there's already 181 out here alone.  However I'm disappointed that Amazon's editorial review implies this is the first \\"rock opera\\" giving no mention whatsoever to the Pretty Things, and pure misinformation such as provided by another reviewer here from Africa.  Sir, what are you talking about?  You state that Sorrow is \\"virtually the exact same story as Tommy\\".  Please, I look forward to your comparative analysis.  There is no comparison outside that they are both psychedelic, The Pretty Things much more so.  Tommy is much more deranged and twisted.  \\"Maria\\" offers a more honest opinion and I agree, EVERYONE should check out \\"S.F.Sorrow\\" if you have not already; it really is worth a listen.  I've known the album for decades and it is a true treat for headphones. <br /> <br />One last thing to clarify though, it is true that The Pretty Things' \\"S.F.Sorrow\\" was recorded and released in 1968, in ENGLAND.  In the USA it was released on Rare Earth records, label #RS-506, which was in August, 1969.  \\"Tommy\\" was released in the US on May 17, 1969.  Who came first?  In the States, \\"Tommy\\" really WAS the first rock opera - but in reality The Pretty Things did do it first, Pete acknowledged in several interviews that he was inspired by it, however the writing is no \\"rip-off\\", it is pure Townshend.  The Pretty Things is pure Phil May, however it's really not quite as strong and coherent as Pete's - but honestly in my opinion musically more interesting and a joy to listen to.  Pete is delightfully twisted, and Phil is delightfully wasted... take your pick.

0316172324|5.0|This is one of those books that some people will just 'get' and others won't. For me, it was like someone finally articulated what I inherently knew about my own mind and thinking --but couldn't describe. I hope Mr. Gladwell will delve more deeply into this theory of instant perceptions, reactions and judgments in a subsequent book. I am fascinated with the ideas he presents --so much so that I am buying the book (again) for my library after having left my copy on an airplane.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I totally missed this series when it was on the tube. After pestering by several friends, I finally gave in and bought the dvds. So MUCH better than Star Trek, really amazing. It's Outlaws vs the Feds, and Outlaws have more fun. Plus, the movie Serenity (based on the series) is coming out September 30th, so if enough people take a look, maybe Firefly will return...is that too much to ask? HUH? See it this month on the SciFi Channel!
B0007QJ1MU|4.0|Ever since Kyuss, Josh Homme has been an interesting and inventive musician.  He has found a nice home in QOTSA, which has become more an ongoing project than a band.  Anyone who has followed QOTSA will know that the core lineup has changed several times (recently with the departure of bassist Nick Oliveri) and that albums have increasingly featured guest appearances by outsiders. <br /> <br />The project/rotating lineup/guest appearance aspect of QOTSA is more evident on Lullabies to Paralyze than previous albums, in my opinion.  This is not to say the album is uneven or lacks a solid theme, however.  Homme clearly had an idea where this record was going, but you can definitely get the sense that many musical minds were involved in its production.  Somehow, the music on this disc has infectious hooks without being pop; it has a classic and nostalgic air without being overtly retro; it's inventive without being pretentious.  As always, QOTSA delivers. <br /> <br />Highlights (discounting the single \\"Little Sister\\") are \\"Burn the Witch\\" (featuring ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons and Jack Black [that's right... from Tenacious D and School of Rock]), \\"I Never Came\\" (which is just *different* and *good*), and \\"Someone's In the Wolf\\" (great dynamics and atmosphere, and with an interesting video on the DVD that accompanies the CD). <br /> <br />New listeners may find this album a bit quirky.  Those coming from the punk end of things should consider earlier albums (esp. Rated R).  Those with mainstream tastes who can't get \\"Little Sister\\" out of their heads should consider picking up Songs For the Deaf as a slightly more accessible disc. <br /> <br />I highly recommend QOTSA in general and this album. <br /> <br />
B000AL730O|5.0|I've been a Beatles fan since 1964 and never get tired or hearing their music.  I haven't liked most of what McCartney has done over the last 35 years.  His songs often sound like careless, throw-away melodies.  Driving Rain was a low point.  Before this album, my favorite was Tug of War.  What these two albums seem to have in common is a strong producer and good arrangements for the songs.  On first hearing, the songs on this album sound somewhat thin, but after repeated listenings the album starts to grab you.  Overall, it's now my favorite McCartney album.
014028009X|5.0|At last a book which is really, actually, laugh out loud funny! Its even funnier than the movie!<br /><br />Its heartbreakingly funny to read about Bridget's days - her inner thoughts (Which are always so ironic, funny and so very true...this is ultimately what makes them funny after all) Women will find a kindred spirit in Jones. The witty comments she writes in her diary are a real gem as we seea year in the life of  \\"30 something and  single\\" Bridget. And the best thing is that she writes all about it day by day. HAr life is hard because she is single and her watch is going tick tock tick tock -most of her friends need a bit of tact too \\"hey bridget and how is your love life going?\\", her married friends keep inviting her to dinner and asking about any boyfriends. She has this fearful image of living alone all her life and then dying alone and ultimately being eaten by her alsation.<br /><br />We can feel her elation when something goes as she wants \\"Yesssssssssss! yes!  yesssss!! lalalalala\\" and almost invariably  they turn into a huge disapointment and despair \\"Where? how? Why why why????....oh sod it!!!\\" But she can cope with it you know...she has lots of inner poise...lol.<br /><br />Also hugely funny are her comments after her daily suming up of how many units of alcohol she has drunk, calories consumed,cigarettes smoked and other various mindless obsessions that Bridget acquires throughout the year.<br /><br />she has such funny and insane theories of how she could have gained weight overnight... maybe food \\"could react chemically with other food, double its density and volume and solidify into every denser and heavier hard fat?\\"<br /><br />If you want to read a really funny book than do buy this one. You are in for a threat. :)

0393970116|5.0|In this 1910 story of Edwardian England, Forster illustrates the conflicts between the superior attitudes of the aristocracy and a developing feeling of obligation toward the \\"lower\\" classes which World War I will soon bring into sharp relief. Margaret and Helen Schlegel are intellectual and sensitive to the arts, with compassionate hearts for those less fortunate.<br /><br />When Margaret, at age twenty-nine, is affianced to a much older widower, Henry Wilcox, this conflict of attitudes is brought to the fore. Henry, insensitive and believing himself actually entitled to his family's privileges, is cold and reserved, though Margaret believes that \\"Henry must be forgiven and made better by love.\\"<br /><br />Helen, her sister, a 21-year-old with an enthusiasm for the life of the imagination, has no sympathy for Henry's staid pronouncements and failure to pay attention to the people \\"below him\\" who are dependent upon his whims. When a young clerk finds himself out of his bank job as a result of something Henry has said, Henry refuses his wife's entreaties to give the destitute Leonard a job.<br /><br />Immensely sympathetic to the economic position of the poor and women, Forster illustrates their financial dependence on others. Margaret, who secures the reader's total sympathy, must try to educate a close-minded dolt like Henry, but she achieves only limited success. Later, his belief that Helen reflects negatively upon himself and his family inspires a disaster with far-reaching consequences.<br /><br />Filled with incisive observations and great wit, the novel follows the narrative pattern of a melodrama, but Forster's sensitivity to both sides--the practical and conservative values of Henry vs. the emotional and idealistic sides of Margaret and Helen--elevates the novel above the tawdry.  With the action centered around the Wilcox home at Howard's End, the reader realizes that the estate is a microcosm for the conflicts of the nation.<br /><br />This edition, thoroughly annotated, is the definitive critical edition containing resource material and an explication of references.  Comprehensive background material for the period, critical analysis of Forster's themes, and careful notes throughout this novel provide a wealth of research materials for the literary critic and historian.

B000002O4X|5.0|Wonderful CD.  Enjoy listening to it regularly.  It's very relaxing, too.
B000252NAI|5.0|Paying homage to the Nat Cole Trio, the most popular jazz combo of its day, Diana Krall (piano), Russell Malone (guitar), and Paul Keller (bass) bring some long-time favorites and some lesser known Cole Trio hits to life. The arrangements are terrific, ranging from slow, bluesy numbers, to swing, a torchy ballad, and forties-style jive. In every case, the emphasis is on the trio, and though Krall sings on every track, more than half of each song is instrumental, with extended solos on piano by Krall and guitar by Russell Malone.<br /><br />Krall's voice is a full, sometimes husky, alto with very little vibrato, and though she can sing scat, and does on \\"Frim Fram Sauce,\\" she is at her best singing slow songs of aching loss, where, occasionally, her phrasing reminds me of Sarah Vaughan. \\"Gee, Baby, Ain't I Good to You,\\" sung slower than Cole did it, is a sad, bluesy number with wonderful, casual jazz piano riffs. \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams,\\" my favorite on the album, is torchy, the imagined tears kept under control as Krall pines for lost love, with the piano ranging into chromatic variations. In \\"You Call It Madness\\" and \\"I'm Through With Love,\\" Krall keeps her voice whispery, singing slowly, almost confidentially, as she maintains the slow beat and melancholy mood. By contrast, \\"Hit That Jive, Jack,\\" moves in a quick, toe-tapping rhythm, as Krall, Malone, and Keller sing together and have fun.<br /><br />The album has plenty of variety to the selections and features three fine jazz instrumentalists who toured together and perfected their ensemble for several months before recording this album. With the earthy voice of Krall added to the instrumental mix, this album is certainly one of Krall's best--a huge success. There are no drums here (except on \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\"), but that is not a limitation, and, in fact, may be an advantage, since the listener's attention remains focused on the tunefulness of the songs and their jazz variations. This is a fine homage to the Nat Cole Trio, which would have been justly proud of Krall's recording.

B000BB1MI2|2.0|This is not doubt one of Tim Burton's greatest works next to Edward Scissorhands. And I've been so waiting to get the dvd in November, but all of a sudden Amazon.com has taken off the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (Two-Disc Deluxe Edition) that is going to be released on November 8th, 2005. Why? It was obvisouly going to sell better than the 1disc widescreen edition. I don't know what Amazon.com is doing. Anyway if it doesn't get back before november 8th, I'm just gonna have to buy it in stores.

B0000027RL|5.0|This is pearl jam's first album and quite possibly their best. Every song on it is a classic starting with the hard rock song \\"once\\" going into guitar crazy \\"alive\\" and slowing it down with \\"oceans\\". It's a great album and I highly reccomend it.
B00002Z88D|5.0|Some fans, who thought making an album with an orchestra was a sell-out, thought \\"S&M\\" was a career killer. I, however, think it's a very creative and interesting idea. Metallica are the first ever(and only) metal band to attempt performing a concert (21 songs) with an orchestra sitting in, so there's no denying that this album is also innovative.<br /><br />And, if you ask me, they pulled this album off nicely. While the electric guitars sometimes drown out the San Francisco Orchestra, the violins, trumpets, and timpani usually make the songs sound fuller and make some boring parts interesting.<br /><br />Plus, even though some fans hated Metallica for making this album, \\"S&M\\" did make them even more famous, and helped expand their listening audience. And, as the old saying goes: any publicity is good publicity.<br /><br />This concert's set list consists of songs from \\"Ride the Lightning\\" to \\"Reload.\\" I think Metallica chose not to include any \\"Kill `Em All\\" songs because they didn't think the orchestra could keep up with that album's insanely fast riffing.<br /><br />Song ratings for disc one:<br /><br />1. \\"The Ecstacy of Gold\\": A cool, ominous introductory track. It sounds pretty, but it's too short. 6/10.<br />2. \\"Call of the Ktulu\\": The violins are really audible on this track, but so the guitars and drums are prominent, too. This is one of the many songs where the orchestra works well with Metallica, and the guitar solo is also still included. 10/10.<br />3. \\"Master of Puppets\\": This song sounds quite a bit different, here. First of all, frontman James Hatfield's vocals are deeper than they were when he first sang this song. Also, in addition to some trumpets making an entrance, James sometimes trades off vocal parts with the crowd. Finally, James drops an \\"f word\\" before one of the choruses. This expletive was (obviously) not in the original song, and it comes across sounding rather random, here. This isn't a bad song, but I just prefer the original. 8/10.<br />4. \\"Of Wolf and Man\\": The violins go well with the low, pounding guitars, and help make the beginning of this song have a dark vibe. Near the end, James asks us \\"Got any wolves out there?,\\" and then he lets loose a big howl. 10/10.<br />5. \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\": The heavy guitars usually drown out the orchestra in this song, and I enjoy how James laughs maniacally when he sings the \\"sanity\\" line. 8/10.<br />6. \\"Fuel\\": The guitars and drums charge straight ahead, and the orchestra really helps \\"fuel\\" and add energy to this song's rhythm. This song is possibly more energetic and all around better than the original. 10/10.<br />7. \\"The Memory Remains\\": I don't like how the crowd kind of takes over the vocal parts on this song, because you can't really understand what they're saying. Other than that, though, this is a good song; I enjoy how it ends with clapping and some classical-sounding strings. 8/10.<br />8. \\"No Leaf Clover\\": The creaky violin strings go well with the opening, soft guitar strums, and I enjoy how the violins play in between the pounding, bobbing guitar riffs at the end. 10/10.<br />9. \\"Hero Of The Day\\": This whole song, especially the beginning, could make better use of the orchestra. This song needs some spicing up. 6/10.<br />10. \\"Devil's Dance\\": I enjoy the ominous sounding violins and trumpets at the beginning of this song. This is a very catchy tune, and the orchestra gives it an extra punch. 9/10.<br />11. \\"Bleeding Me\\": The violins again make this song sound fuller and richer, and Kirk's guitar solo is as good, here, as it was on the original version. Unfortunately, this song is a little too long and boring in parts. 7/10.<br /><br />Disc two:<br /><br />1. \\"Nothing Else Matters\\": There's a cool flute-sounding instrument, and it helps to add some atmosphere to the beginning, but, other than that, the orchestra doesn't really add much to this song. 8/10.<br />2. \\"Until It Sleeps\\": This is a good metal song; it gains momentum well,but the orchestra should have been left out of this one. 7/10.<br />3. \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\": The violins ride the beat well, on this song. The orchestra plays at the same time as the guitars, thus making this song, in my opinion, sound better than the original. 10/10.<br />4. \\"Minus Human\\": The orchestra is really accentuated and blends well into this song's heavy, punching guitars. Unfortunately, this song ends kind of suddenly, and it sounds rather incomplete. 8/10.<br />5. \\"Wherever I May Roam\\": This is a great, classic metal song, but the violins sound kind of forced, here, like the orchestra felt like they needed to be included. 8/10.<br />6. \\"Outlaw Torn\\": The orchestra sounds right at home, here. It makes a nice, twinkling sound at the beginning, and the rest of the song has a good friction between the soft and heavy parts. 10/10.<br />7. \\"Sad But True\\": This song sounds louder and heavier, here, than the original, studio version, and there's some excellent violin playing, which make for some good background noise. 10/10.<br />8. \\"One\\": A great song in the `80's, and it's great live, too. The highlight of this song is when the trumpets begin and play with Lars' double bass drumming. 10/10.<br />9. \\"Enter Sandman\\": The riffs and rhythm of this song is as catchy as the original, and the violins again add some ear candy, but I kind of wish James sing during the chorus. It's a nice touch, too, when the song pauses briefly, near the end, for a couple of orchestral solos. 10/10.<br />10. \\"Battery\\": Almost as good as the original. Almost. I don't like the beginning, when the violins kind of drown out the acoustic guitars. 8/10.<br /><br />So, the orchestra works better in some places than others, but this C.D. is, overall, quite great. \\"S&M\\" is easily Metallica's most innovative album since 1986's \\"Master of Puppets,\\" and it has a set list of songs that kind of make this C.D. an unorthodox \\"Greatest Hits\\" album for Metallica. It's a good place to start for newcomers, and a great inclusion in every Metallica diehard's collection.<br /><br />\\"S&M\\" is a little bit too long (it's over 132 minutes in length), so you might want to listen to this album in stages, before you become bored with it.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is one of the best live albums I own, and even if you don't like it, you should at least give Metallica props for attempting something which was so risky and experimental.violins ride the beat well, on this song.

B00002Z88D|4.0|First of all, I have to admit that I don't own this CD, (yet).  So to be honest, I haven't actually listened to this recording.  BUT, I DID, watch the concert on PBS, and it was amazing!!  If you get a chance to see it, watch it!  And if it's available on DVD, buy it!  Trust me, it's worth it.  You can't imagine the energy and electricity in that concert hall that night.  This is something the band had wanted to do for quite some time, but for whatever reason, didn't persue.  So oddly enough, it was the conductor of the San Francisco Symphany that approached them.  Because the idea of playing with a symphany behind them was new and challenging, and something they had been wanting to do...AND because there was skeptisism and pressure to pull this off, they put everything into it!   Trust me, you've never seen them like this!  It was the LIVE concert of their lives!  Metallica's last few albums (from Metallica, the \\"Black\\" album on) have been so brilliantly produced, that I really didn't think they could sound any better.  I was wrong.  The merging of electric guitars, drums, and Hetfield's voice, to a symphany of of musicians and instruments is pure musical genius, and an absolute masterpiece!  You won't believe how incredibly the two blend together, and also feed off of each other.  While I was watching, I could see the give and take of intensity from the band, and then the symphany.  It was like a game of tennis, back and forth, back and forth...building and building.  Awesome!!True, there were some white-headed, season ticket holders that walked out in a huff, horrified that a \\"Heavy Metal Rock Band\\" had infultrated their precious concert hall.  But they were the minority, most stayed.  And of the open minded ticket holders surprised to see a heavy metal rock band playing with their symphany, a great many of them were won over by the performance. And I'll bet quite a few even became Metallica fans.  This is quite the collaberation.  The classical elligence, and sophistication of a symphany, combined with the, experimental honesty, and edge of a rock band.  We haven't seen anything like this, since the boy with the chocolate bumped into the girl with the peanut butter.  And we all know how well that turned out!  Honestly, this is like night and day.  But it works.  The music is intense, and beautiful, and it's all very dramatic and inspiring.  I've never seen anything quite like it.    If you're already a Metallica fan, you know their talent. But if you've only heard their studio albums, you're missing out, because they've stepped it up here.  I'm telling you, you need to hear this!  If you're new to Metallica, you won't be disappointed with this CD.  It's Metallica at their best...their most energized...and backed by other world class musicians!I'm so impressed with what I saw and heard.  And I'm so excited that they put their performance on CD.  My only beef, and the only reason I couldn't give this 5 stars, is because they left off one crucial song.  The song I looked this CD up for, \\"Fade to Black\\".  I'm very disappointed they didn't include their amazing version of \\"Fade to Black\\" from that night.  Hetfield's guitar solo's were very long and haunting.  And it was magnified by the darkness in the concert hall while he played.  And as his solo ended, perfectly on cue the symphany came thundering in.  It was incredible, it gave me goosebumps. This was the most memorable, most amazing song they did that night...and it's not on here.  That's a crime.  Guys, if you're listening?  If you ever re-release this CD, or need to add a song to a studio album, I'm begging you right now!  Please, for the love of god, and all that's holy, put \\"Fade to Black\\" from the San Francisco Symphany concert on there!  Put it on twice!!  Ok?  Cool. Thanks. :)Get this CD.  'Nuff said.
1400032717|5.0|I finished the book in one day. It was hard to believe it was fiction. The author was able to show the way the boy saw the world and how he was able to cope with his life. I am going to read the other books he wrote because he wrote it as if he was the protagonist. I highly recommend this book.
B00004XONN|5.0|This album emcompasses my `musical coming-of-age,' specifically because it's one of the most atmospheric albums ever recorded, and also an absolute masterpiece. It's a slick, multi-layered, and beautifully structured mixture of rock and electronica that reveals an entirely new dimension of Radiohead's capabilities and talent: starting with the piano driven Everything in Its Right Place, to the dreamlike Motion Picture Soundtrack, the band cycles through various styles and combinations, and does that quite successfully, if not perfectly. This album is especially significant for me because it's about subtleties; the excruciating amount of detail I heard on each and every track on this album completely blew my mind. There isn't any particular moment of distinctiveness; everything meshes delicately into one experience. This album is smart and well crafted, and it forever changed the spectrum of music I listened to. Everything loud suddenly turned to everything subtle, heavy riffs turned to delicate melodies, and my definition of music became something simpler to listen to, and infinitely more difficult to write.
B000ASATWQ|2.0|Yo this is straight played out copied generic reggae dub beats.  You think this is original?  You need to come original like 311 you know what I'm saying?
B00009V7T2|5.0|Arguably the most successful musical experiment ever. Get this: This album manages to mix jazz, funk, punk, prog metal, electronica, and a whole bunch of white noise into one cohesive experience. Pretty impressive, if you ask me. I HATED this album when I first listened to it; it grated on my ears and made no sense at all. For some reason though, I was drawn to it, and gave it more listens. Somehow heard it with a new attitude; I began to \\"understand\\" it. I discovered its complexities, cohesion (sort of), and sheer creativity. This album wedged a giant crowbar in my musical taste and pried it wide open. It thought me to LISTEN, and that the best music out there often takes more than one listen to fully appreciate.
B000000OUJ|2.0|I don't know why this album gets the props it does. there doesn't seem to be any point where the production or the emceeing tries to grab you....and yet this is heralded as not only a classic, but by many people as the greatest hip hop album ever. It's nowhere near an Illmatic, The Infamous, Stress The Extinction Agenda, 93 to Infinity, any Kool G Rap' early to mid 90's stuff, Stunts Blunts & Hip Hop, Bizarre Ride II The Pharcyde etc, etc, etc...it doesn't even come close to 36 Chambers. I think this album is boring.
B00000099Y|5.0|This album defined my `coming-of-age' musically. It is Tool at their most intense, full of the driving bass lines, heavy guitars, and thrashing drums that define so much of mid-90s metal. This album, though, is strikingly unique because the heaviness is intricately laced with moments of sheer melodic bliss. `H.', the album's third track is the perfect example: it starts with a pounding three note bass line and slowly progresses to moments of utter rhythmic beauty. Maynard draws a deep breathe before he sings softly over clean guitar scales and the ticking of drum rims, and suddenly bursts into a high-pitched scream, careening the song back into it's heavy beginnings. This album taught me to listen less for the next heavy riff and more for MUSICANSHIP, and in that respect, is probably the most important album I've ever listened to.
B0009R1T7M|4.0|The initial conclusion is one of high production value but, well, boring.  However, with repeated listening one becomes engaged and semi--addicted.  He who sticks with this recording, will be rewarded many times over.
B000AL730O|5.0|Now this is how I like my McCartney! Fresh, surprising, tunefull, up close and personal. Paul really delivers with this outstanding collection of songs.  <br />Since I picked up this album I have been listening to it. This is the album I've been waiting years for him to make! Kudos to Paul! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B000002UTY|5.0|This fabulous music, musicians, time, space and all your reviews, those who were there and wish they had been there...I just want to say how grateful I feel to read your reviews and to know that I am not alone in my absolute love for these guys and sounds and voices...and to say that Shady Grove, what a sweet album...long ago and far away there was love...and apparently there still is...thanks again. Absolute 10 stars...
B0007OCG56|5.0|I found the movie very funny and I liked the promotion of family values. I liked specially the way Cristina' mother teaches her to appreciate her heritage, which also happens to be my heritage. <br /> <br />I found the scene in which Cristina translates her mother's argument with her employer one of funniest since the \\"tantrum by the dry well in Baby Boom.\\" <br /> <br />For my taste they could have left out the racy scene between the husband and wife after he gets the review as Best Chef.
B00004BZ16|5.0|There is no doubt the redundance of reverb and annoying sythisised noise was nothing but filler to an otherwise fantastic \\"double\\" LP. What I found was a tamed yet still politically motivated rock band. They used their resources but nobody heard them.  <br />I enjoyed the use of kids and cameo guests on this lp. It worked for Pink Floyd. Not to draw a parallel.  <br /> I see this as an album that expresses where this band wanted to go but we wouldn`t let them. They obviously were influenced by the Mod/ Ska, Reggae,and Irish Folk or Bluegrass and possibly Zydeco. Might a stretch but it was not what we were expecting from them at the time which forced them to produce that POS Combat Rock. I much rather they went on with their experiments. At least there might be a chance they would still be making music.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|This is a beautiful cd!  It is just lovely.  Tradition meets modern capabilities!  Truely a good find!
B00005JODA|5.0|In a year full of really bad and extremely stupid movies, it's a blessing to have a film that is intelligent and thought provoking as The Constant Gardner. Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz do wonders for this magnificent thriller that will keep you on the edged of your seat to the very end. Fiennes once again proves to be a master of quiet mannerisms with his heartbreaking and intelligent performance as Justin Qualye, a shy British diplomat who must uncover the reasons for his wife's murder and uncover a government cover up of illegal testing of the poor and destitute of an African village who are being used as guinea pigs to test out experimental drugs for a pharmaceutical company. Rachel Weisz plays Tessa, Justin's late wife who was investigating the corruption when she mysteriously died. Weisz gives a supercharge performance that is full of bravado, guts, and humanity and Justin's flashbacks of her makes you not only respect and admire her for her bravery but makes you grieve for her as well because of the beautiful person she really was.  <br /> <br />The directing of Fernando Meirelles gives this thriller the spark it needs to fully in habit the world where Justin and Tessa lived and makes you just as weary as they both were because of the lies and corruption that darken this other wise beautiful landscape with human blood.  <br /> <br />It's good to know that good movies still can be made in this day and age and it's good to know that we have good actors like Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz to give life to characters that we all can believe in.  <br /> <br />If you want to be moved and entertained, you can do no better than this film.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JKC3|3.0|HULK is one of those movies that I found myself ambivalent about.  While director Ang Lee has a certain undeniable flair, the movie itself is not what one would expect, in terms of action.  Credible CGI effects are brilliant, and Eric Bana and Jennifer Connolly do a commendable job in filling out underdeveloped roles.  I must also admit that as I did in the t.v. version of the HULK, I wondered why Banner busts out of all of his clothes, but always seems to have his pants intact.  Seeing this behemoth bounce, jump and create pandemonium of course is the high point of the movie, but trying to legitimize the storyline as pathos only hinders the pacing.  Nick Nolte is effective as Banner's demented Dad and Sam Elliott is his usual cowboy self as Connolly's general father.  Josh Lucas in an uncharacteristically villainous role doesn't have enough screen time or motivation to flesh out his character.  While I found myself entertained for most of the movie, its nebulous ending and psychobabble finish weren't really what I wanted.  HULK pales terribly to the far superior X MEN and SPIDERMAN movies, but it's not the horrible disaster many critics claim.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I bought this disc on faith when it first came out.  I had heard that she was going to be the next Billie Holiday or Nina Simone.  I was getting into jazz at the time, and I was hoping to find some new artists.  What I found was something truly special.   <br /> <br />Come Away with Me is one of my favorite discs.  Norah has this sultry voice that permeates every song.  It has that quality that lets you escape from the world around you.  She's not quite all vocal jazz and not quite all pop, but instead she's something in between.  Someone who bridges the two to find music we can all enjoy. <br /> <br />The Nearness of You is my favorite track on the disc.  If you have someone special in your life, it's the kind of song that makes you want to be ... well, near to them.  Quite magical.  Just like the whole disc.
B00005JNQS|3.0|Rodney Copperbottom (Ewan McGregor) has never been a rich robot.  His dad worked in a restaurant as a dishwasher, so instead of shiny new parts, Rodney always had hand-me-downs.  But Rodney dreamed of a better life as an inventor.  So when he's finally old enough, Rodney decides to say goodbye to his parents.  He buys himself a one-way ticket to Robot City, where he'll finally meet his hero, Bigweld (Mel Brooks) and make his dreams come true.   <br /> <br />Once Rodney arrives in Robot City, however, he finds that Bigweld has disappeared, and he's been replaced by Ratchet (Greg Kinnear), who, with his mother, Madame Gasket (Jim Broadbent), is plotting to do away with hand-me-down robots once and for all.  Together, with his new friends (including Fender, played by Robin Williams, and Piper, played by Amanda Bynes), Rodney decides to find Bigweld and bring him back to Robot City. <br /> <br />Don't expect any Oscars for Robots-because it's just another animated movie.  Yes, the animation is pretty cool, but that doesn't carry this movie past its dull and unoriginal plot.  Robin Williams, who brought life to Disney's Aladdin, may be a bright spot, bringing plenty of laughs-but even he couldn't make this movie more than just so-so.  Robots is an amusing movie-good for a few laughs.  But after all the great animated movies that have come out lately-with original stories, spectacular animation, and plenty of humor-moviegoers have learned to expect more than just a few fart jokes and a neat animated scene or two.  Rent it if you've got nothing better to do on a rainy Saturday afternoon-or buy a copy to keep the kids entertained for a few weeks-but it's not a must-see.
B00078XGRO|5.0|It's awesome.  Period.   If you like Star Trek in any way, shape, or form, you'll love this movie.  It's got humor, suspense, romance, a story, (YES!  A LOT of sci-fi DOES actually have a STORY!) as well as enough wiz-bang special effects to make us drool. <br />The DVD itself features crisp video and perfect sound.  The special features, if you're into that sort of thing, are numerous and interesting. <br />A+ DVD.  A triumph. <br />
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I first heard of this band when the Sigur Ros message board was raving about them.  There would be at least one new post every DAY it seemed about this band.  Just people talking about how good it was.  Whenever this happens, I find it very difficult to get into a band.  I get very annoyed when a band is over-hyped and raved about by lots of people.  I'm not sure why...it's something that happened to me in Jr. High with Nirvana and NIN too.<br /><br />Anyway, I gave it some time to cool off.  They were on a local program where I live called \\"Turnpike\\" that features a different band every episode and shows a show.  My interest was piqued a bit by this, and after a while I finally bought the CD.  After my first listen through the album, I was hooked.  I dunno what it was, but the honesty and beauty of it just grabbed me.  It left me feeling good.  Now I'm just sad I missed them the last time they came through.<br /><br />Anyway, no doubt if you're not familiar with this band's sound, you might not care for the singer's style (thing Efrim from Silver Mt. Zion).  But once you get past the broken vocals, it really has potential to grow on you.  I'd like to give this a 4.5, but since I can't I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and go with 5.
B00000I8UK|5.0|The music of Eric Dolphy is always stimulating, but on OUT TO LUNCH we get a sonic masterpiece. This disc - although filled with nerve wrenching thorns - opens up intense thoughts and emotions as only a master craftsman could conjure. It's definately a prickley album - and not for the listener who prefers fluid, polished melodies... but if you like compositions that bend with exciting improvisations... this set will excite you! - this music is in its own category!!
B000089RVX|5.0|This is my favorite album ever. There is not one song I don't like. I've been listening to it for almost every day for about eight months, and STILL haven't grown tired of it!  <br />Just one general note before the track breakdown: Listen to the lyrics on this album, folks. This isn't like any other band's lyrics, where the motto is \\"I loved her, she dumped me, I was depressed, yatta yatta yatta.\\" No. The lyrics on Fallen are simply astounding, chilling, profound, haunting, intense, heartrending. Nine of the eleven songs on this album have made me cry. Go figure. <br /> <br />Going under - Amy Lee's favorite 'Fallen' song, Going Under is one of the three \\"Gothic Tracks\\" of the album, should you consider Evanescence a Gothic-inspired band. It is dark, angsty, richly-worded, very original, and overall, an enchanting opening to the album. 16/20  <br /> <br />Bring Me to Life - The most famous Evanescence song. A breathtaking and portent-filled piano melody begins the song and is then mutated into what has won numerous awards, including Best Rock Song and Best Hard Rock song. Amy Lee's vocals are absolutely incredible and the lyrics will render you speechless. 20/20 <br /> <br />Everybody's Fool - A dazzling guitar riff sets the tone for Everybody's Fool. Full of despair and determination, it is a perfect balance between the forces of good and evil. Perhaps the most powerful lyrics in the album are found in this song. Coupled with a sensational melody and administered by Amy Lee's passionate vocals, Everybody's Fool is more than a song. It's a tour de force. 17/20   <br /> <br />My Immortal - Pure pain and anguish spilled into a musical melody, Grammy Nomination 'My Immortal' is Evanescence's most popular song after 'Bring Me to Life'. Exquisite vocals, agonizing lyrics, soothing piano, and a stunningly beautiful melody combine to yield tears on the toughest of hearts. 20/20 <br /> <br />Haunted - The second of the three aforementioned \\"Gothic tracks\\". VERY dark and EXTREMELY disturbing. The choir addition at the end will only serve to haunt you further. Creepy and bone-chilling to the core, if the music in Haunted won't leave a strong impression on you, the lyrics will. Guaranteeed. 16/20 <br /> <br />Tourniquet - A magnificent guitar opening is steered into forceful, painful vocals and a torture-filled melody. Uniquely dark. The strings at the end of Tourniquet serve to lead up to its larger counterpart, Imaginary. 16/20 <br /> <br />Imaginary - Considered by Evanescence themselves to be one of the best songs of their five-year professional career, Imaginary is the epitome of classical music richly embellished with hard, dark rock, embroidered with a thread of pop, and laced with just a dash of metal. Add Amy Lee's spine-tingling voice to the mix and you've got yourself a celestial musical masterpiece. A true magnum opus. 20/20 <br /> <br />Taking Over Me - as with Bring Me to Life and My Immortal, Taking Over Me opens with a heavenly piano solo which opens the gate to a striking guitar sequence. Amy Lee's dazzling, powerful vocals and lyrical talent are oh-so-exposed in this heartrending creation. There is an angelic vocal solo with soft piano accompaniment near the end. Overall, simply beautiful. 20/20 <br /> <br />Hello - Written for the death of Amy Lee's sister. Gentle piano notes lead to ardent, passionate passages with a low cello solo near the end. Of course, Lee's voice only serves to enrich. Truly heartbreaking. 17/20 <br /> <br />My Last Breath - Interestingly enough, this song opens up with an almost pop-like sonancy. Commencing with synthesizer, it is then transformed into a classical Evanescence production. Very powerful lyrics and compelling melody. My last breath is what many consider to be the \\"love song\\" of Fallen. 14/20 <br /> <br />Whisper - This legendary song (Whisper and Imaginary are Evanescence's oldest masterpieces) speaks for itself. Orientally-themed, grippingly lyricized, and the third of the threeaforementioned \\"Gothic  tracks\\", Whisper is a mightily enchanting piece. The Latin at the end finishes off the album on a dark, angsty note. 16/20 <br /> <br />All in all, musically, lyrically, and vocally this album is absolutely flawless. Buy it! <br />
B0009R1T7M|3.0|Stevens has captured the sound of every familiar melody and wrapped it up in the most precious package. It's Paul Simon does Ssshhhh-Core. Ambitious and Talented, he is ushering in a kinder - gentler genre of music. Fun the first time around then when you start to think about it you want to smash something just to snap out of it. <br />Do not file under ROCK.
6305308659|4.0|PLEASANTVILLE is a remarkably filmed and superbly performed slice of Americana.  Director Gary Ross uses black and white and color in a unique fashion, as we watch the black and white world of Pleasantville erupt into gorgeous pastels and bright colors to signify its entrance into the real world.  If there's a problem with PLEASANTVILLE, it might be that instead of being a homage to those LEAVE IT TO BEAVER, FATHER KNOWS BEST days, it actually exposes its fake sentimentality and improbable wholesomeness, and suggests that the real color world is more desirable.  I don't see any harm in having those black and white comedies that made family life so pure and romance something that was more of a mystery than an experience.  It seems Ross and his screenwriters wanted to deflate those halcyon days of the fifties and sixties, and make us realize that even though our world is fraught with ugliness, it's better to be in color than black and white?  Anyway, the cast is marvelous:  a pre-Spiderman Toby Maguire exudes a wonderful naivete and wisdom; a pre-Legally Blonde Reese Witherspoon transmits a naughty and seductive undertone as the worldly sister; Joan Allen and William H. Macy are perfect as the parents; Jeff Daniels does well as the soda jerk and Don Knotts is good as the instigator of the whole Pleasantville transformation.  It's a delightful film but it still makes me question the need to deflate such an integral part of our societal background.  Enjoy, though.
B0002PUHF6|5.0|This movie is awesome.  I love cheesy horror, and this one takes the cake.  Lot's of blood and guts!!!!!!!!
B000009ROK|5.0|Luis Miguel is an exceptional voice.  My wife and I really enjoy his music.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I hear the guys that put this show on fridays and out of order are cleaning public water fountains for a living. Okay, maybe not, but when karma kicks in... <br /> <br />The writing on this show is just incredible. In a few episodes you will love all of the crew members of Serenity, even the ones you hated after the first couple.  <br /> <br />Without question this is a better series than any Star Trek. I think this is because it is a far more realistic, believable future with characters we can all understand. Who doesn't understand the idea of just trying to get by in the world with what you have?  <br /> <br />Fans frequently compare this to Star Wars. There is definitely a common idea or two. This series is every bit as innovative as Star Wars. I am not exaggerating. I'm just not talking special effects. The innovation comes from technological and conceptual backtracking to create a more natural, immersive feeling. <br /> <br />The heroes are not monodimensional good guys, but are clearly good at heart. Captain Malcom Reynolds will shoot first and not lose any respect for it. He's not the genius of a Star Trek Captain and that makes him more likable. He is a great leader of small groups of men. His care for those under his command is clear.  <br /> <br />The other characters are each unique and likeable for their own reasons. No one of them is perfect, but all have enough for anyone to sympathize with.  <br /> <br />Joss Whedon's writing is perfect for the current world. This is not a relaxed pace but at the same time everything is done for a reason and contributes to the characters and/or story. <br /> <br />This is not just for SCI FI fans. The setting is SCIFI, the stories are not. The characters are not, well 8 of the 9 could exist without SCIFI. <br /> <br />Arguably one of the best Series ever.  <br />
B0000C6E4D|4.0|This recent album of Sarah's is very well done and is relaxing.Like no other singer, she has a voice that captures your attention regardless of what mood you are in. I think it is worth listening to over and over....
B00005221M|5.0|I have enjoyed this film every single time I have watched it(which is quite a few times.) The scenery and cinematography are lush and beautiful, and the story unfolds well to its titular, yet sad ending. The Director's Expanded edition is fabulous; the scenes which have been cut back in flow smoothly and add new flavor to the mix. <br />I know that for James Fenimore Cooper purists the script wandered from the original focus and purpose, but to watch Daniel Day Lewis' intensity, Russell Means' stoicism, Eric Schweig's quiet strength and Wes Studi's burning hatred of the white man makes the change to a drama/love story worth the creative license. <br />Watch it at least once, and if you find it as entertaining as I think you will, you will understand my enthusiasm.
1881273156|5.0|I cannot praise this book highly enough.  So much of what I have experienced in life is explained so well with the simple concepts that Gary Chapman presents in this easy to read manual on human relationships.  Often relationships suffer when both parties are trying in ways they think are best, but leading to unintended hurt feelings.  This book helps you sort out good issues to think about.  I found it challenging to sit back and think about myself and which love languages I respond to the most.  Although the book offers suggestions on exercises to discover one's own love language, I found it difficult to prioritize them.  Some of the suggestions led to conflicting results in my own self assessment.  Nevertheless, this book offers insight unlike any other relationship book I have seen.
0895260131|5.0|Finally!  Somebody with the courage to tell the truth.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who can't understand why the islamic terrorists hate us so much.  President Bush frequently says that they hate \\"freedom\\".  That's the politically correct reason but not the REAL reason.  No one in today's establishment wants to offend anyone so they are afraid to tell the truth about the matter.  The simple truth is this... they hate you because you are an infidel and because you refuse to convert to Islam.  There are some Islamic apoligists who will tell you the religion is peacefull.  This book provides facts and quotes from the Quran that directly contradict that belief.
B0009UC7H0|3.0|What happens when you take a negative of a negative?  As an example, the novel Sahara was absolutely awful, a one-star effort that failed on almost every level of plotting and characterization.  Clive Cussler, the book's author, however, disowned the movie version of his novel.  Did this mean that the film would be good?  The answer is \\"sort of.\\"  Sahara the motion picture is a vast improvement over the source material but is essentially just an okay movie, neither bad nor good. <br /> <br />The movie version of the story follows Dirk Pitt (played by Matthew McConaughey) who is basically a marine version of Indiana Jones who seeks underwater treasure for a semi-private organization called NUMA.  He and his friend Al Giordano (Steve Zahn) go up the Niger River in search of a Confederate ironclad that apparently crossed the Atlantic and wound up in Africa.  Meanwhile Dr. Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz) is in search of the source of a mysterious ailment that is apparently coming out of war-torn Mali.  The dictator there is intent on eliminating all outsiders, and soon Dirk and Al are assisting Eva as they find the source of the plague and do a little treasure hunting on the side. <br /> <br />On the plus side, most of the truly awful parts of the book have been eliminated, most particularly a supposed plot twist involving Abraham Lincoln.  The movie's writers have just taken the book's core plot and characters and reworked it into a light action movie.  On the minus side, none of the lead actors are all that great.  McConaughey and Zahn are reasonably amiable and Cruz is nice to look at, but none are really good actors.  The best in the cast would be William Macy, but he is underutilized. <br /> <br />On the other hand, this is not the sort of movie that requires talented thespians, just some decent action and effects, and there is enough of that to keep most viewers entertained.  Overall, this is a three-star film, not particularly good or bad, a routine action movie that allows you to turn off your brain for a couple hours.  I cannot really recommend this movie, but I wouldn't warn people away either.   <br />

B00005ATQD|4.0|`Eyes Wide Shut' is Stanley Kubrick's last film and like every other film where he had complete creative control (For `Spartacus' and `Paths of Glory', Kubrick was largely an employee of Kirk Douglas), there is much which is both brilliant and puzzling.<br /><br />From the outset, I will say that while there is much nudity and some fairly explicit sex in this film, it is clear to me that all of this was done for a greater dramatic effect than simple `soft core porn'. This case should be clear if you compare this film with `The Story of O' which, while it has honorable intentions and high aspirations to be something more than a piece of pornography, the difference in the level of artistry should be obvious, as `The Story of O' is very high class pornography and `Eyes Wide Shut' is not.<br /><br />Much can be adduced from Kubrick's source, a work of fiction by Arthur Schnitzler entitled in German,`Traumnovelle' or `Dream Novel'. While I am not up on the details of Schnitzler's work, I know he worked in pre-World War II Germany or Austria at a time when the doctrines of Sigmund Freud were easily at their high water mark, especially among playwrights and novelists. One needs a copy of Freud open to work out much of the symbolism in, for example, Eugene O'Neill's plays such as `Mourning Becomes Elecktra'. This means that any sexual references are certain to have at least two or more interpretations, as Herr Freud and his students found sex to be behind most motives. And, for men, at least, that belief persists to today.<br /><br />At the very least, this literary source gives us a clue that a lot of what we are seeing has many dreamlike properties, if not explicitly scenes from a dream. Another thing this source explains is why the locations for the story are much more at home in Paris or Berlin or Vienna or Prague or Rome or London (where the film was actually shot) than in New York City. While American robber barons build their fair share of large houses and estates, they can't hold a candle to the opulence found in pre-World War I European houses of the nobility. It would not be a bit surprised if Schnitzler's original story took place in Vienna and its outskirts.<br /><br />The problem with the dream scenario is that there is no evidence that the highly improbable centerpiece scene of the story, a highly ritualistic pairing of strikingly beautiful virtually naked, masked women are paired up with robed and cloaked members, seemingly both male and female, of the onlooking crowd, in a very European looking suburban estate. Admission to these proceedings are exclusively by password changed every day, and given out, it would seem, to a highly exclusive group of (probably) exeedingly wealthy people. And, everyone participating in this erotic pantomine wear Venetian style maskes.<br /><br />I confess that it took me three attempts to watch the movie to its conclusion without falling asleep before the ending credits roll. Part of that is my fault for watching it late in the evening, but part is due to the fact that the pace of the dialogue and business is almost somnambulistic. This is not the Tom Cruise of `Top Gun' or `Days of Thunder' or expecially `Rainman' when he was in top form. I believe the relaxed pace was certainly coming from Kubrick's direction and not Cruise's acting. I tried to picture a more high powered actor in the role such as Nicholas Cage or Russell Crowe, and I could not see them adding any real energy to the performance.<br /><br />The very best scene in the movie occurs when Cruise's character, a highly respected doctor, rousts the owner of a costume shop out of bed at 2:00 AM to rent a tuxedo, cape, shoes, and mask in order to attend the password access only estate party. The shop owner, played by Rade Sherbedgia is a perfect study of a first generation immigrant shop owner in New York City. This scene also gives us some clue that all is not as it seems when the shop owner discovers his very nubile teenaged daughter consorting in secret with two very oriental gentlemen, while the shop owner and daughter seem to be or some central European nationality. The aura of strangeness is doubled when the good doctor returns the clothes the next morning and meets the two oriental gentlemen and the shop owner in polite conversation, with no trace of the fatherly rage of the early morning.<br /><br />To cut to the chase, this is certainly not Kubrick's best or most memorable film. `2001', `Lolita', `Dr. Strangelove', `Full Metal Jacket', and `Clockwork Orange' are easily better. Even his rendition of the obscure Thackery novel, `Barry Lyndon', starring Ryan O'Neill has some better moments than `Eyes Wide Shut'. And yet, it may still be better than 2/3 of the other movies made today. Like all Kubrick movies, it definitely succeeds in making you think about the film.<br /><br />Recommended for Kubrick fans and fans of all other `autre' directors such as David Lynch, Peter Greenway, and Ken Russell.teenaged daughter consorting in secret with two very oriental gentlemen, while the shop owner and daughter seem to be or some central European nationality.

B00005JN2Z|3.0|Let me tell you where the plot goes wrong. About 15 minutes into the movie, Tom Cruise gets into Jamie Foxx's cab randomly. So what you ask? The entire premise of the movie revolves around Cruise's character Vincent getting into Foxx's cab. Which is what makes it such a distraction. WHY would a hit-man use a cab when he could easily have rented a car? Or stolen a car? Foxx's character Max asks \\"why my cab\\" instead of the more pressing question: \\"why any cab?\\" <br /> <br />Cruise plays Cruise, and this film looks too much like \\"Ali\\", another Mann flick.  <br /> <br />Otherwise, Jamie Foxx is great and the film is entertaining. I recommend you fast-forward through the part where Cruise gets in the cab and invent your own story to explain what the writer and director didn't.
B000BB1MI2|3.0|I just went and watched the movie and was VERY disapointed by it. Most of all Johnny Depp was horrible as Willy Wonka. He was creepy and physochotic. Gene Wilder was 100 times better, he was more eccentric and magical and more true to how I pictured Willy Wonka from reading the book. <br />All in all the movie was fun to watch but nothing spectacular. I liked the actors/actresses in the older movie better, one exception being the part of Charlie.

The Shadow of the Wind, with its beautiful language, mysterious characters, tragic love and Fermin!!!<br /><br />Fermin made the story for me. The once homeless self proclaimed spy entered the bookstore and completely intrigued me.<br /><br />Zafon is a gifted writer...if you've ever dreamed of writing..his work will make you jealous. He is that good.<br /><br />I am so completely satisfied with this book. I find no flaw. I used to read solely for that reason: to find the flaw.<br /><br />No sense in looking here. The Shadow is hommage to excellent literature.
B0009UC7H0|2.0|The upside is that the movie has an interesting plot and non-stereotypical events & action scenes. It keeps you interested as the plot about the coins, ironclad and plague unfolds and you begin to put it together. However, the movie lacked character chemistry - it's supposed to be a \\"buddy\\" movie with the main characters friends since kindergarten. But the way they interact is more like annoyed co-workers. Of course there's also the romance angle, but that lacked chemistry too. Normally you look for the hero & girl to shack up by the end because you feel they're made for each other (or at least would be a nice couple), but in this movie I just didn't care. The ending was pretty unsatisfying as well - one expects that everything eventually gets artfully tied together to make sense to the viewer, but instead it is hastily slapped together. In the end, it's not a horrible movie and does have some redeeming qualities, but is lacking in several ways.

B0006284JQ|5.0|Isn't it ridiculous that such innocent music causes so much anger or even hate in some people? Thanks to this strange mystery these people make Spears' music uncommon in some way. It's simply high quality pop music, that's all. It can't be compared with rock icons. It's different caliber. Spears is huge in her own one. And don't tell me about bad reputation and poor sales because even Madonna had such periods in career. Today i'm asking: so what?!  <br /> <br />The bestselling artist in the 21st century Britney Spears summarizes with this collection first six years of her outstanding career and shows her story from teenage sensation to icon of pop-culture. She started with simple catchy pop songs which were written for her just to be hits, but in the 21st century she was converted to less commercial r'n'b and club music instead of selling incredible amount of records and above all she began to write her own songs. This album is a certificate of evolution from manufactured teen idol to professional artist and icon of pop-culture.  <br /> <br />Spears has as many fans as anti-fans, so there are varied opinions about her music. But we must to admit that facts are on Spears' side, because her music achieved not only commercial success with 60 million sold albums and twenty hits all over the world, but above all artistic with numerous nominations to the most prestigious music awards including Grammy. And no words can take it back from her.  <br /> <br />Spears with all these hits took over the throne from Queen of Pop Madonna and Queen of R'n'B Janet Jackson. That's why she sold much more records during her career than Madonna and Janet put together in the same period of time! And such hits like: \\"...Baby One More Time\\", \\"Oops...I Did It Again\\", \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" or \\"Toxic\\" are classics in history of pop music already.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately this is a US edition of this set, which means the poorest one. It has only 17 songs (14 international hits and 3 brand new tunes), because it omits these two hits from standard international version of this album, which were released on singles only overseas \\"Born To Make You Happy\\" and \\"I Love Rock'n'Roll\\". But why Britney's record company didn't put here a million-seller US hit \\"From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart\\" and chose little hit \\"Outrageous\\" instead of much bigger \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\". But this is special edition of this album so you can find a bonus CD with 6 very interesting remixes and \\"Megamix\\" of Britney's biggest hits instead.  <br /> <br />Like you see it's better to buy the most expanded version of this album, which contains 20 songs (with both non-US singles and \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\" as well) and which is also available in special version with bonus CD with all 6 remixes and \\"Megamix\\".  <br /> <br />And it's only beginning...
0784011710|5.0|Longish though compelling drama about a Polish woman, Sophie (Meryl Streep) who has endured Auschwitz; her schizophrenic Jewish lover, Nathan (Kevin Kline), who torments her; and a young Southern writer, Stingo (Peter MacNicol), who lives in the same Brooklyn tenement with them shortly after the war. Both Nathan and Stingo are in love with her, which figures into part of Sophie's \\"choice\\"; late in the film we are exposed to her other choice, made during her concentration camp days, which has riddled her life with guilt - a guilt that forces her to choose the sadistic Nathan and eventual suicide.<br /><br />The characterizations are excellent - we are drawn in despite the length and lavish development (the use of a narrator helps here); the acting is superb (Streep won an Oscar). It's a very moving and intelligent performance. An excellent movie; definitely worth a watch.
068987474X|4.0|This book is a straightforward, easy read with almost zero psychobabble -- and most importantly, it's all stuff that we women already know in our hearts, even if we can't bring ourselves to admit it at the time.  <br /> <br />It does a great job of cutting through the imaginary subtext we apply to dating situations that are actually pretty simple.  If he likes you, he'll call.  If you're his Ms. Right, he'll ask you to marry him. With a few exceptions, when it comes to how a man feels about you, it's that easy.  This book is just an entertaining and effective reminder of how simple it really is.

B00005JMYI|1.0|I keep waiting for a movie starring Will Ferrell that makes me laugh but I haven't found it yet. I think he is perhaps one of the most overrated comedic actors of this time. I figured I'd give this movie a try because it was on HBO and there was nothing else on. Boy, am I glad I didn't waste 8 bucks at the theater. Alright, I admit I laughed at a few scenes but I don't think Will Ferrell was even in those scenes. I'm sick of previews telling me \\"this is the funniest movie of the year\\" and then not delivering. It is very sneaky and underhanded. Don't even waste your time with this \\"comedy\\".
B0002IVN9W|3.0|a decent album for sure, with the shining exception of Neighborhood #1 (track 1).  This song is a masterpiece, i mean it really floored me, but unfortunately the rest of the album cant follow up that song.  The rest of it is just okay, with the David Byrne influence right on thier sleeve.  Honestly, the first song is so good that its worth having the album just for it
B0002IVN9W|4.0|The problem with The Arcade Fire is that they cater to the critics. This album is such a wet dream for those idiots. It has everything they look for: catharsis, diverse instrumentation, hip production, theatrics, and an empathic back story. Somewhere a critic is ejac ulating all over this album right now.    But I can't argue that The Arcade Fire doesn't make decent music. Despite all the critic-catering, this is not a bad album. There are no weak tracks. Some are better than others - like \\"Wake Up\\" is better than \\"Neighborhood #4\\" - but compared to the competition... The Arcade Fire wins.    Funeral starts off good and ends even gooder. All of the \\"Neighborhoods\\" are decent romps, and \\"Une Annee Sans Lumiere\\" is excellent. But the album really gets going near the end. After \\"Wake Up\\" breaks down to its jambling conclusion, the last three songs are standouts: \\"Haiti\\" reminds me of being on vacation; \\"Rebellion (Lies)\\" is like a faster, upbeat \\"Neightborhood #1\\"; and \\"In the Back Seat\\" purges emotions and brings the album to a confident close.    This is one of those albums when it's like a journey to listen through the whole. There's beginning, middle, and end, like a story. This is a no brainer to recommend to indie fans, and that's the main problem. I need my brain back. (8/10)
B000AARKOO|5.0|I went to see this movie very cautiously, because as a Christian and knowing that Ridley Scott is an Atheist worried me.  However, in terms of religion, the portrayal of Christians and Muslims is fair and seemingly unbiased.  Also, I am not a historical scholar, but I do realize that the Crusades were not a proud time for Christianity and that the Muslims were actually more civilized then the Christians.  So, in my opinion, the movie portrayed that correctly. <br /> <br />Now, to the movie itself.  One word came to mind after seeing this. <br /> <br />Wow. <br /> <br />In what was quite possibly one of the best movies of the year, the story of the crusades is put to life on the screen for everyone to see.  The settings and landscapes were simply breathtaking, and the cinematography was excellent. <br /> <br />As for acting, Orlando Bloom shocked me.  Before now, most of his rolls had been either supporting or sharing the lead, but I must say, he pulled off his character, that of young Balian. <br /> <br />The supporting cast, which included Jeremy Irons, Liam Neeson, and Edward Norton, were amazing.  They truly carried the movie. <br /> <br />Lastly, as a Christian, I know that many people who see this and who do not like Christianity in general will point to the Crusades and say that if that was in the name of Jesus, then that may be what Jesus stands for.  I want to let you know that Jesus does not stand for this.  The Crusades were men doing evil things and justifying their actions by claiming they were for Jesus.  So please, if you have any other questions about Jesus or what he stood for, go to a local church and talk to the pastor there.
B000BBYMA2|5.0|\\"Battle Royale\\" is a superb film, subtle and sad and over-the-top and loud all at the same time. The story is often compared to \\"Lord of the Flies,\\" but that is a bit of a misnomer. \\"Lord of the Flies\\" was about reverting to primitivism, whereas \\"Battle Royale\\" is a futuristic cautionary tale in the tune of \\"1984\\" and \\"Brave New World.\\" The caution at work here is the threat of absolute bureaucracy, and the dangers of the loss of the value of life and respect in a rules-dominated society. This is a threat quite apparent in modern Japan.<br /><br />The actors in \\"Battle Royale\\" all deliver excellent performances, including the amazing talent \\"Beat\\" Takeshi Kitano playing the appropriately named \\"Kitano.\\" The film was not directed by Takeshi however, so it lacks his beautiful visual style. It does however feature one of his riveting paintings. There is a good range of responses from the various actors playing the students, from outright suicide, to panic, to a drive to win to a drive to help. Unfortunately, the character of Kazuo Kiriyama (the machine gun boy) is woefully underdeveloped, and instead of the fierce, cold genius of the book he is a somewhat characterless villain.<br /><br />While a violent film, I wouldn't characterize \\"Battle Royale\\" as an action film per se. Anyone looking for a Hong Kong-style action film should realize that Japan and China are quite different countries with different approach to movies.. \\"Battle Royale\\" retains the quietude and patient pacing that is the hallmark of Japanese cinema, and which leaves some viewers bored, who are used to a quicker pacing. The bloodshed, while in great quantity, is also more cartoony in nature, which is also more typical of Japanese films, which does not favor a naturalistic approach.<br /><br />I think some familiarity with problems in modern Japan (ie: school violence, overwhelming bureaucracy) gives some necessary perspective to this controversial movie, and helps frame it as more than exploitation. It is a political statement, with a subtle message underlying the overt violence. Along with this, knowledge of Japanese culture deepens the understandings of certain scenes, such as when Kitano performs the prescribed exercises, and the training video shown at the beginning. Without understanding, these scenes might come off as merely quaint or odd.ion. It is a political statement, with a subtle message underlying the overt violence.

B000001GQY|3.0|Late in his career Emil Gilels took a turn into so-called monumental playing of Beethoven and Brahms that doesn't appeal to me half as much as his earlier, more fiery self. There is a great Brahms 2nd Concerto with Gilels the younger and Fritz Reiner that, to my mind, outshines this performance in every way. I have owned the present set twice and both times I discarded it after a few hearings. If you like slow, large-scaled Brahms for these concertos, the young Barenboim made a wonderful set with Sir John Barbirolli on EMI.
B00003CX8U|5.0|Song and Dance that is extra  special and a pleasure to see.
B000A3XY9Q|5.0|The is the best presentation of Evil Dead 2 I have ever seen. The image restoration is phenomenal, and the level of detail in almost every shot is now astounding. Its worth upgrading just for the new video transfer. The extra's are unfortunately mostly repeats from the previous special edition although a new documentary where the special effects suppervisor comments on a number of behind the scenes pictures is a welcome but not overly satisfying addition. THe movie speaks for itslef......its comic perfection.

B00013F38K|5.0|The contrasts between the lifestyles and values of the American \\"Wild West\\" and a Shaolin priest (trained in Buddhism and the art of Kung Fu) is candy for the mind.  The camera work and editting are excellent for a TV show and the scripts are always thought provoking and entertaining.
B00030IZY0|3.0|Although the show is AMAZING, the transfer is  just  a  little  off.  Her lips don't always match what she's singing &/or saying & the picture is a little grainy but, it's a great performance.

0380977788|5.0|This was such a wonderful and creepy story. Neil Gaiman's use of language was a true delight. Each page (if not each paragraph) featured some wonderful treasure of a phrase. In addition to that, the story was very engaging. I could see the \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" allusions, but this was less of a scary acid trip, and more just a wonderful spooky story. Gaiman's descriptions and wordplay were genius.  Often very succint, he could use just a small, simple phrase to make all the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.  (black button eyes?!?  Eek!!) Coraline was a very brave and resourceful young lady. Great stuff.
0375422889|1.0|Persepolis 2 is everything Persepolis 1 wasn't. In fact it's a bit of a yawn. The author's story of life as a student in Europe is ho-hum. It does pick up a bit when she returns to Iran, but never reaches the heights of the first book.
B00006M183|3.0|This is not your classic Pearl Jam. In fact, the beats, the rhythms, and guitars sound as if Pearl Jam was covering another band's songs. There is nothing wrong with that I suppose. <br />The only thing is that Eddie sounds really off key in a lot of tracks. It's kinda like an old school band whose singer has lost the plot. You can tell thr difference by hearing Eddie Vedder here and on Ten, or even No Code. Riot Act is not the best album since Vitalogy, or Yield for that matter. Granted, Riot Act is better than Binaural but, I don't know,..I guess the truth of it is alot of songs are just terrible. For example, Eddie really has trouble keeping up the pitch on \\"Get Right\\", I find \\"You Are\\" almost embarassing in a way. <br />Overall the album is listenable but it truly lacks the \\"vital\\" energy and solidity Pearl Jam once had...and as you go further towards the album it gets worse and worse.  <br /> <br />
B000005AYM|5.0|THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS IN THE 90. her style is so unique and diverse. everything she sings, sounds so real. her lyrics are like poetry. my favorite song is next lifetime.
0451197968|5.0|When I first read this book in the early 90s, I thought the plot was so far fetched ... now in this age of shows like survivor, I'm not so sure. Stephen King gives us a look at our not-so-distant future, only slightly exaggerating the world of television as we know it. Be prepared to be shocked by the lengths people will go to for entertainment!
B000AU9UYM|5.0|When I saw Batman Forever & Batman & Robin,I wanted to throw myself out the window knowing that Jerry Bruckheimer killed the Batman legacy in the movies (espicially with Batman being my favorite superhero and idol). <br /> But when I saw Batman Begins,I was in beyond awe of the such perfection Christopher Nolan has given the 5th movie. <br /> <br /> 1st of all Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale have definately outdone Tim Burton and Michael Keaton (which by the way did remarkabely for the first 2). <br /> <br /> 2nd not only did Bale do a top-knotch performance but got into the Batman psyche better than Keaton, Clooney, and Kilmer. <br /> <br /> 3rd the action scenes and visual effects were great;espicially since a lot of it was shrowded in darkness which a lot of people disagreed with but I thought was clever and great for the DARK Knight enviromentally speaking. <br /> <br /> 4th Michael Caine and Morgon Freeman seemed to be pretty into the rolls they were given making them good in the movie as well, and was a wise desicion on the movie casters part. <br /> <br /> 5th the plot and storyline went somewhere and served a purpose and didnt just have a bunch of action scenes for nothing. <br /> <br /> And finally with there being upcoming sequels to Batman Begins and a great visionary director, high talented crew, and a cast more than fit for Batman...there is only one thing i didnt think I would say after Batman & Robin came out...BATMAN LIVES!!!
6304498969|5.0|What does it mean to be a musician? I love music of many kinds but unfortunately for me I don't understand its structure, and so I can't seem to figure out how to play. I am a person who constantly has a song running through his head, I breathe in time to music, so music is very much a part of me. That's why it's fortunate for all of us who don't play that there are musicians like Eric Clapton.<br /><br />Ever since this disc was recorded not too long after the death of his son, Clapton has done some work that is \\"uneven\\" as the critics would say. It's like the Monty Python Contractual Obligation Album - I did it because I had to. He cranks out a lot of albums so it's natural - given that volume - that some will not be stellar quality.<br /><br />Not the case here. In these songs, you see Clapton's heart laid bare. There's \\"Tears in Heaven\\" - the song dedicated to his son who was killed in a tragic fall from a terrace in a high rise apartment building, an acoustic version of \\"Layla\\" that will surprise you with its appeal given the difference from the famous one you're already familiar with, there are several Robert Johnson tunes - from Clapton's idol and major influence, and some other songs that all just blend together like threads in a colorful fabric. Nothing seems out of place: the choice of songs, their sequence, the backup musicians... This overall character gives this DVD a certain listenable quality that makes you drag it out and throw it in fairly often. I can't seem to tire of it.<br /><br />At the time it came out, I was designing and selling high end Home Theatre and Music systems, and after hearing and seeing this disc at a Custom Electronic Design And Installation (CEDIA) convention, I picked up a copy to use in demonstrations for my clients. Every time I played it, the people stopped kind of \\"going through the motions\\" in the demo and were grabbed by what they were hearing ...and seeing.<br /><br />The whole MTV Unplugged is an intimate series where you're closer to the music (as it's all acoustic) and closer to the musicians, too. Here you get it all - the Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack is clean and tight with a rich undertone throughout. The instruments sound warm. The camera angles and the choice of shots allow you to really feel and appreciate the talent you're witnessing here not only in Eric Clapton but in the carefully chosen musicians for this session. Chuck Lovell on piano is a standout among them. Remember the \\"Clapton is God\\" era back in England? Well, Mr. Clapton may not be God exactly but his playing is divine... always.<br /><br />That's what makes this disc special out of all the others similar to it that you might own. While Clapton is always extraordinary in his technique and in display of his technical skills, on this disc he seems to be most comfortable with the venue, the style of play, the song list, and with his motivation. It's like he's trying to reach us and show us what this kind of music is all about, show us its heart and soul.<br /><br />Isn't that what a musician is supposed to do?'s all acoustic) and closer to the musicians, too.

B0009S4IHY|4.0|I bought this movie before I had even seen it hoping that the movie would be as good as my expectations were for it.  After the 2nd time I watched it, (first time I fell asleep) I really liked the movie.  Because I fell asleep the first I missed alot of storyline and when I woke back up, I didn't think it was that great, but I gave it another chance and really enjoyed this movie.  It is dubbed in English or you can just read subtitles, but you will miss a lot of the movie while you are reading.  The actions is great and made to be over done but that's what makes this movie cool.  It's like watching a cartoon knowing that real people would never survive half the things that happen to the people in this movie, but we accept it because it is funny to see what happens to them, just like in a cartoon.  I didn't care too much for the axe gang dancing around, I thought that was kinda dumb, but I did really enjoy this movie.  Check it out.
6304119046|5.0|I'm not very smart.  Just wanted to get that off my chest.  As if you couldn't tell.  And as you can see from my other reviews, I like both kinds of music, country AND western.  So that makes me a good movie critic.  Oh, and I like to post the same reviews under different names.  Wink, wink.  This is a movie that stupid people such as me won't like.  Aren't you happy that I cleared all that up?
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|Wow.  System of a Down's latest album is a glaring, critical look at politics in the modern world.  This band is unafraid to challenge the system, and they generally come out sounding great.  Not only is their music of top-quality in a world of cookie-cutter \\"I hate the world and everything in it\\" bands, but it's also bone-crunching and harmonious at the same time.  The lyrics to most of the songs are darkly satirical and blatently outraged. <br />  Top tracks include: B.Y.O.B. (a scathing indictment of Bush politics and the war in Iraq), Cigaro (a tune that seems inane at first, but give it a second listen), Question! (a haunting song about death), and Sad Statue (a beautiful song about the degredation of democracy). <br />  I enjoyed this album and am looking forward to their next release: Hypnotize.
B000AJJNPY|1.0|IF you like ENYA, guys who compose music with synths and dudes who think its clever to sing like they have an overload of estrogen, but without the energy-you'll love this stuff. Perfect music for your magic crystals, your Dungeons and Dragons gaming, your deep-tissue massage. In other words, it's not really music or songs at all. Its just soundscapes composed on a synth that you or I could make had we a couple of Roland synths. Pretentious, artsy-fartsy and utterly lifeless. Good stuff for those of you who like to think you're just a little bit more sophisticated than your average music listener. DOA.
B00000DCHD|4.0|Okay, I know that everyone considers \\"The Stranger\\" to be the end-all-be-all of Billy Joel's works for that time, but I have always disagreed with that.  THIS is it as far as I'm concerned.  Albeit  that is a good album.  My favorite song is \\"Scenes from an Italian restaurant\\".  Lord knows \\"Just the way you are\\" was played to death on the airwaves and maybe that's why I'm not ecstatic over it.  In my opinion \\"52nd Street\\" shows range and is more varied than \\"The Stranger\\".        The first of the  standouts for me is his ode to Phil Spector's Wall of Sound, \\"Until the Night\\".  This song very easily could have been sung by the Righteous Brothers.  I absolutely adore this song.  It's far from his mainstream and Joel had the guts to pull it off when 98% of the artists seemed to have a fear of paying tribute to a style that may have been 10-12 years out of date at the time.  He didn't care but of course the label did so it never got airplay.      Then there's my all time Favorite Billy Joel song \\"Rosalinda's Eyes\\".  Again unorthodox so he is being true to himself in it and you can hear it in his voice and phrasing.  There's a lot of passion and soul to this song.  The authentic Latin flavor makes me want to dance every time I hear it.  A true gem.     I've always known that he was a master of many styles which is what makes him the icon that he is. You can't put his music into one box and each type or style is done well.  Not all songs are hits but the ones that you remember are wonderful.  From Turnstiles which is a masterpiece that his highly underrated and hardly mentioned now a days to his Fantasies & Delusions classical CD he is a Mass-appeal Marvel with something for everyone, classical to eclectic.   Now that's a Musician
B0000027D5|3.0|I love this album, and yes, I have the vinyl version too (one of my rare duplicates). I won't repeat what the others have said, except to say that this is some of Santana's best music, done at his peak. Unfortunately, the recording quality isn't the best, and the trnasfer to CD is pretty bad. Parts are fuzzy that aren't fuzzy on the LP. I'm not impressed.
0060007737|5.0|An easy read and as far as I'm concerned one of the Bibles of marketing and branding
B0000CNY27|5.0|This cinematic masterpiece just isn't fair to the rest of the movie world, or to humanity in general.  It's just so epic in its scope, its haunting and, might I say, avant guard portrayal of New York a la 'Lord of the Flies' (but lord of the flies is more like 'a steaming pile of dung with lots of flies buzzing around its foul odor' compared to this work of genius).  I mean, the socio-economic implications of this movie are simply staggering.  Ok, I'm not sure what socio-economic means, or how it applies here, but I'm always right so I won't delete it.   <br /> <br />Look folks, I'm a complete off the flizzle PIMP when it comes to the ladies, and to kicking ass, being cool and not sucking.  But let's face it, Rudy don't have a sweet reptilian-inspired name like 'Snake'.. or even 'snapping turtle' or 'Limbless Snake-tooth Skink'; nor does he sport a hard-ass eye patch and talk real gruff in a crazy monotone voice that's just TERRifying to all who hear it.  I mean, THAT's how good Kurt Russell is.  He can pretend to be a horrible actor and never change the timbre of his voice but pull out the breakthrough performance of a lifetime.  How the Academy ignored his performance here boggles my higly evolved mind.  When he said \\"Call me Snake\\" I crapped all over myself and had to take a 20 minute shower to get the smell off of me.  The amazing thing is that even after the 500th time Snake said in that gruff voice to \\"Call me Snake\\" I still crapped myself.  Yes folks, I crapped myself 587 times that night.  But I still got laid, that's how good looking I am.  This is a GREAT date movie by the way. <br /> <br />Ah, John, you complete me.  John Carpenter made the super-cheesy quick zoom fashionable in this early 80's menagerie of perfection, much in the same way that The Vapors made the idea of \\"Turning Japanese\\" into the latest craze in uber-culture mimicry.  I sang \\"Turning Japanese\\" in this disco bar in Lafayette, IN one time, wearing a kimono with nothing under it.  I'm anamazing  interpretive dancer, plus I have a huge unit that was bulging out, so suffice it to say I scored some major asian tang THAT night.  But back to John Carpenter.  Ok, probably the most important part of any movie is the soundtrack.  We can all agree on that.  And this one scores in the top five soundtracks of all time.  Maybe top 3.  The dichotomy of using nothing but crap synth and horrible fx that I could easily create on my casio portable keyboard and somehow pulling off the soundtrack of a lifetime just floors me.  Bravo, Johnny boy, bravo.   <br /> <br />In summary, Johnny C. is a visionary and a scholar, Kurt Russell is the most versatile and non-repetitive actor of all time, this movie has a script that rivals Apocalypse Now or even (dare I say) Fast Times at Ridgemont High, and the soundtrack should win every grammy in every category ever invented.  Don't miss this movie. <br /> <br />-Rudy
6305428042|4.0|At first sight I figured that this movie was just another attempt by hollywood producers to make an extra buck.  However, I was completely wrong.   Hocus Pocus had a good combination of well timed humor, acting, and a well thought out plotline to make it a very good family film.  So if any family is looking for a movie for their 7 year old kids for halloween or entertainment purposes then this is your movie.
0394800192|5.0|This is a great book for a toddler.  Very simple words, and counting too.  There are a couple pages where the animals each have different numbers of apples on their heads, and I always stop my two-year-old and ask him to count the apples on each of them.  He also likes to identify each of the animals: dog, lion, tiger, bear.   <br /> <br />He is also learning to read with this book.  He can read words like \\"top\\" and \\"ten\\" and \\"apples.\\"  He really surprised me though by memorizing some of the text, so that on every page he knows the first couple words!  \\"Look, see!\\"  \\"Look out!\\"  \\"Come on!\\" <br /> <br />I loved this book as a kid, and yours will too.  I guess the board book is not the full book, so I would get the paper-paged book once your child is old enough to not tear it apart.
B000002MP2|5.0|This album was the first CD that I ever bought. My first taste in Green Day came in the Insomniac CD that came out after Dookie. But after I bought all the Green Day CD's that they have made, I keep saying that Dookie is their best CD. They have an excellent mix of punk music with new age rock that gives Green Day a unique sound that no band has matched to date. There is not a single song that does not have an awesome beat to it. Every song is catchy, and remains unique to Green Day and no other band. People say Green Day sold out by signing with a bigger label, but by signing with a bigger label, they were able to share a special type of music with the entire world.
B000A0GP4K|4.0|If you like Bob, you'll like this. I just finished watching it and have seen it all except for the bonus material -- which I'm really looking forward to watching... in about a week.  I definitely recommend letting time pass between watching the two parts.  This is a lot of Dylan to absorb in one sitting.  You might want to pace it out.   <br /> <br />The first half is essentially a pretty fascinating history of the folk music scene (and I'm not even a folk fan) and the ways that Dylan fit himself into the whole thing like a puzzle piece.  The second half is a look into how the avalanche that Dylan created caught up with him, and how he dealt with the chaos and the positions it forced him into.   <br /> <br />Yes, you actually get to see Dylan being asked by a newspaper photographer to, \\"Suck on your glasses.\\"    <br /> <br />There's some great, widely bootlegged footage, lots of very nicely cleaned up stuff from \\"Eat the Document\\" (no Lennon in the limo, though).  I think the most surprising stuff are the early outtakes of \\"Subterranean\\" in different locations from the famous alley, with Dylan flubbing the timing of the cue cards.  Quite hilarious, I didn't know it existed.  There are also clips of his Warhol screen test.   <br /> <br />In the end, \\"Direction\\" gives a lot of information but it doesn't really give many answers.  Sara is completely ignored.  The accident; the drugs; the individual latter albums are all blurred together.  Still, the bottom line, the beat is good and you can dance to it.   <br /> <br />And while I won't downgrade this disk for the previews, I too was wondering, \\"Why the hell are there previews for 'MacGuyver' in front of what's supposed to be a definitive musical document?\\"
B000AJJNPY|5.0|Words will never suffice to adequately describe the music of Sigur Ros. Coming from Iceland, in a little more than five years, they've made the universe their stage, with a sound that doesn't repeat anywhere else in nature and touching some of the deepest fibers you could ever imagine to be found inside of you.<br /><br />With a balance of instruments and ethereal voices that doesn't know barriers or limitations imposed by musical genres, their fourth album, \\"Takk...\\", exceeds all expectations by their previous fans, leaving their previous production, \\"( )\\", in the dust. It will take you in a trance you will not want to leave and it will force those riding with you in the car to tag along with you, something that they are not likely to regret.<br /><br />If you think I am exaggerating, take a pick: there's almost no part of this album that you can go wrong with. Whether you want to call their sound post-rock or any other name you care to give it, it doesn't matter. The truth is, if you could see their music... you would see heaven.

0689835604|5.0|My son LOVES this book.  The flaps are sturdy and easy for him to pull by himself. And he loves pointing to the baby's body part and then to his own (and whoever else is around).  As soon as we reach the end of the story he says \\"AGAIN\\". Over and over and over....  <br />But it's a great book, with cute illustrations.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I spent a long time in relative opposition to the Mars Volta, claiming they were pretentious. My newfound love for them doesn't deny it; they're pretentious as hell. They're also possibly the most innovative band out there in an age of cheap retro throwbacks and dime-a-dozen nu-metal. The music is breathtaking, blending improvisation, spacey effects, and Cedric Bixler's inimitable croon. The interludes can get to be a bit too drawn out (and I'm told it's worse on \\"Frances the Mute\\"), but sometimes they're necessary to take a breather from the onslaught of cutting guitars and machine-gun drumming. Omar Rodriguez is a front-runner for most unpredictable guitarist of all time. I'd feel like a jerk embellishing on single tracks; it's gotta be swallowed whole. Wow. Just wow.
B000AADYYO|5.0|After the double release of Damnation and Deliverence, not to mention the extensive (though somewhat lackluster) DVD - I never thought these guys would have a new album out so quickly, and Ghost Reveries is not a rushed project. <br /> <br />Opeth do not disappoint, remaining true to form yet finding a way to make this album stand apart from their other releases. Their signing to Roadrunner Records does not seem to have affected their approach one bit. If you are huge fan of their recent releases - Blackwater Park and Deliverence in particular, you are not going to be disappointed with Ghost Reveries. If you are new to Opeth, I recommend delving into one of those aforementioned albums before tackling this one. <br /> <br />Like all of their albums, Ghost Reveries provides a great deal to digest, and though I've heard it over 20 times, I am still discovering it. The song arrangements are detailed and journey through extreme changes from mellow prog rock to full on death metal in a seemless fluid motion. <br /> <br />Notable is the addition of a full time keyboard player which certainly adds a different feel to their music (Beneath the Mire, in particular). Another significant change is Mikael's singing vocals: Ghost Reveries finds him experimenting with different approaches - now the music doesn't drop to mellow when his voice does. The Grand Conjuration is a good example of a new vocal approach where during the verses he sings in a dark, almost gothic moan which contrasts his usual bittersweet approach. The overall effect creates one of the most climactic and epic tunes Opeth has ever composed. <br /> <br />Buy this album, it will not disappoint you.
B00004Y6NT|2.0|I really dont like this album!! The only good song on this <br />album is Lady Writer. Also another good song is Where Do <br />You Think You're Going?. Better off with DS Debut album. <br />I'll give this CD 2 stars because I like Lady Writer and <br />it is one of the best by them.
B00005YUPO|2.0|\\"Baby Mozart\\" is a better title, but my daughter's favorite DVD now is \\"Singing Babies Nursery Rhyme Time.\\"  Classical music is fine, but I wanted my girl to know all the classic nursery rhymes that I grew up knowing.  \\"Singing Babies\\" has gotten her making sounds and clapping.  I am very impressed. <br /> <br />
B00004Y6NW|5.0|Great debut from Dire Straits, originally released in 1978 Sultans of Swing was the number 4 in 1979. This album features<br /><br />songs like Down to the Waterline, Sultans of Swing, & Lions.<br /><br />My favorite song on this is Southbound Again because it has great<br /><br />riffs. I like many songs on this album, Six Blade Knife has<br /><br />great bass from John Illsley. and great rocks on Down to the<br /><br />Waterline & Lions. Number 1 ranked for Starts of Dire Straits fans before you buy Making Movies, Love over Gold, On Every<br /><br />Street & Brothers in Arms. Then you will want to start out with<br /><br />live albums such as Alchemy, On the Night, & Live at the BBC.
B00082IJ08|4.0|The Gorillaz are one of my favorite bands of today *...i mostly like classic rock...or the pillows....those guys are pretty good* In the beggining the Gorillaz were awesome. Eacbh of thier tracks had a cool Hippie-rock- techno kind of feeling to it. Each track unqie...then this comes out The second album fromt he Gorillaz, Demon Days, is not better then the original..contray to popular belief. I never really liked hip hop before but my favorite songs on here *which include mostly hiphop* are Dirty Harry, and November has Come. It starts to kicking ass and taking names, then quickly becomes a very slow, but cool kinda feel, until the  big endding. The two probably lightest sounding..almsot church like songs, I've ever heard from the Gorillaz are on this cd...and are the two final songs and for some reason...i can not get the lyrics to  Don't get lost in heaven out of my head. I just can't. This album includes everyones favorite Feel Good Inc....though i didn't really like that one. And well...that's the only song anyone that didn't buy this has ever heard of...which I think is kinda sad really. Well and some have hear dof DARE but...that's like maybe 20 random people from all over the world. These guys are a great band, but are simply not reciving the attentiont hey deserve, they have many good songs, not just the one song people think is good. If you do not buy this album you will be missing out on a wonderful experience. Although a few songs get quite annoying...*cough WHITE LIGHT cough* it is still great. Though White gives a rock feel....anyway BUY THIS ALBUM! Now that the Gorillaz have changed so much people might start liking them..though i have lost a little respect for them because of this alubm, they are still a great band.
B00079FUI6|2.0|I think all nice things about the show have been said.  I pre-ordered this Item since May. Unfurtunatelly in those days Amazon didnt publish all the feautures this DVD series would have. NO spanish subtitles or any other language. But it comes close captured + English subtitles (both)  <br />I really Dont understand why if Desperate Housewives is a great show, the DVD producers IGNORED the spahish market. How difficult could have been to put the spanish subtitles??? In Mexico we can watch this series with them or even dubbed. Fortunatelly my english is not bad. But my family doesnt speak english. <br />Salvador Silva, Monterrey Mxico

B000AP04FG|4.0|Mrs. and Mrs. Smith is a great summer movie starring two of the hottest stars in Hollywood, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. <br /> <br />I liked the chemistry between Pitt and Jolie and action behind this movie, especially the fight that destroys their house. The story starts out with the telling of why the Smith's marriage is failing apart. They attend marriage counseling and because of their profession, neither can reveal that their true jobs are assassins for hire. Both eventually discover their spouses' true profession and that is when the sparks fly. I also enjoyed the Vince Vaughn character who plays a fellow assassin and John Smith's best friend. <br /> <br />There are enough explosions, car crashes, high-tech gadgets, and shoot-outs to satisfy hard-core action fans, and the sly, witty banter and chemistry between the stars will please the romance/comedy fans. Jolie is so appealing that you can't take your eyes off her. She handles casserole dishes and automatic weapons with equal ease, and looks terrific the whole time. Pitt is also delicious eye-candy; they make a beautiful couple.  <br /> <br />The film is too long, but it's a well-made and funny, thrilling, and clever movie that is sure to delight Brad and Angelina's fans. The ending is somewhat disappointing but overall this is a fun movie.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This album is great and I find I keep having to place it back it my cd player for another listen.  Billie Joe, Mike, and Tre' have created pure rock 'n roll genius in that they have managed to pay homage to the sound of many great bands without plagiarising them ( The Who, Yes, Queen, and even Boston ) in the songs \\" Jesus of Suburbia \\" and \\" Homecoming \\" . I swear that if Bach or Beethoven ( the Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd of their day ) were alive today and heard those two songs, they'd be completely blown away by them ! There is plenty of the signature Green Day punk sound on this cd as well. To call Green Day sellouts because they are willing to experiment and grow musically is like saying that The Beatles ( you may have heard of this obscure '60's group ) should still have been playing Love Me Do and I Want To Hold Your Hand on their Let It Be rooftop gig in 1969 !! Those Beatles !! What pathetic sellouts ! If Green Day had wanted to stay with two and three chord punk rock tunes that would have been fine although I'm sure they felt they'd done quite enough of that already . The fact is that a band in their early thirties is going to write music that is different from what they did in their late teens and early twenties .  Many complain about how they are so sick of having heard \\" Boulevard of Broken Dreams \\" and \\" Holiday \\" ten thousand times on the radio . Hey, that sure as hell isn't Green Day's fault and it doesn't change the fact that they're both excellent songs. You can bet those stations wouldn't have given those songs more than a few spins if the majority of their listening audience didn't indicate that they wanted to hear them. Alot .   This cd does what every decent rock album should - rock you right down to the bone ( American Idiot, She's a Rebel, St. Jimmy, Extraordinary Girl ) and also on occasion ( dare I say it  ) touch you with well thought out lyrics and music ( Give Me Novacaine, Wake Me Up When September Ends ) . If I ever do find myself stranded one day on a proverbial deserted island , I'll be really pissed off if I forget to bring this cd .
B00003CXCW|5.0|The 1950 classic \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" is available on DVD with features like a behind-the-scenes/background story from director Billy Wilder's closest working friends, trailer, and the movie itself has been masterfully transferred into DVD with the latest technology. William Holden stars as Joe Gillis, an aspiring writer who moves to LA and Hollywood in search of fame as a screenwriter but gets more than he bargains for when he meets up with faded silent film star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson in a superb performance sadly overlooked by the Academy). While Swanson is perhaps too melodramatic in her performance as Norma, she can still pack a punch and I was certainly very moved by her performance as a bitter, deluded woman on the brink of madness. We are able to see her plunge into a Mad Scene at the very end of the film and how she gets there is the meat of the film. The look of the film is meant to resemble film noire (complete with monologue/narration by Holden's character Joe). After more than 50 years, this film is still terrific. It is part comedy, part tragedy, a slice of real life, a work of fiction. It is meant in a way to poke fun of the blind ambition of Hollywood and its negativity rather than its optmism. The look of the film is appropriate to its Gothic mood. <br /> <br />The movie opens with a close up on Joe's dead body - he is even narrating from beyond the grave in much the same way as today's current similar voice-over in Desperate Housewives. Joe tells of his struggles as a writer. He's broke, his writing is not very popular and he feels he has struck gold with Norma Desmond. She proves to be detrimental to his success and she keeps him virtually trapped in her world of illusion. Norma Desmond was once a great actress in the silent film era (1ate 1900's, 1920's during the days of Rudolph Valentino, Theda Bera and Mary Pickford). She is now forgotten and ignored, living a fantasy life, thinking she is still a great star. \\"It's not me that's gotten smaller, it's the pictures that got smaller\\" she says to Joe. She is convinced she is still beloved all over the world (\\"why do they still write me fan mail why ? why ?). Little does she know that it is her own butler and ex-first-husband Max that indulges her fantasies and is lying to her writing those letters himself. Norma is the true star of the show, though it seems that this movie made Bill Holden a star. The famous line \\"I'm ready for my close-up Mr. De Mille\\" is one of Swanson's lines. <br /> <br />A classic movie sure to remain one of the all-time great films.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I was an Avenged Sevenfold fan back in the day. I had Sounding The Seventh Trumpet. I thought it was ok. Now forward to the future. I know this cd came out in the summer of 2005, but the review I had written before didn't really show how I feel about this cd.<br /><br />\\"M. Shadows\\" or whatever he calls himself has, to me, always been the weak part of Avenged Sevenfold. I was never a fan of his screaming, or the way he sings. I love singing and screaming, and I don't think M. Shadows is good at either. The music on the other hand, has always been amazing. Synyster Gates and Zacky Vengeance are amazing guitarists. My friend has this cd, and I actually sat down one day and listened to about half of it. I was amazed by the guitar. The music on this cd is incredible. The Reverend is quite good at playing drums as well. I give this cd 5 stars and give Avenged Sevenfold credit for having great musicians.

1400032717|5.0|Christopher's autism just makes it harder for everyone, not least himself. Any description of Christopher's family, as seen through Christopher's own eyes, can only fall short of Haddon's unique text. It is a first-person narration, striking for its clear, simple, and almost inhuman style.<br /><br />Teen years are hard for any family, but harder when there's a chronic  illness to attend. And, although I've never met someone like Christopher, I do know that not all illnesses are created equal. Rather, not all people are created equal in their ability to cope with different illnesses, and failures can be tragic. Christopher's father does a superhuman job, but even that can't guarantee success.<br /><br />Christopher's frankness and naivete, his confusion about simple acts of everyday life and his prodigious skills, the things he sees and the things he misses, they all add up to a baffling but very real young man. Although wholly fictional (as far as I know), it's almost a documentary on his strange way of being as human as anyone.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B00003CXTG|1.0|Pearl Harbor, a black day in american history, and even blacker day when Michael Bay gets a great idea to make it into a movie. Historically this movie blows, Casting wise(except for Cuba) this movie is a bore-fest. There are so many true stories about that day, but they choose to make this movie a love story with some unrealistic war scenes on the side. I have a great story about that day, its about a real american hero, who was put into this movie as a sidenote, when he should have been the beginning middle and end. :<br /><br />This is a story about Dorie Miller its a love story about him and his country.<br /><br /> Dorie was the ship's heavyweight boxing champ on board the USS West Virginia (BB-48).<br /><br />Dorie was awarded the Navy Cross by Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, on board USS Enterprise (CV-6) at Pearl Harbor, 27 May 1942, for heroism on board USS West Virginia (BB-48) during the Pearl Harbor Attack, 7 December 1941.<br /><br />He was killed on 24 November 1943 in the line of duty while serving in action on board the USS Liscome Bay (CVE-56)during Operation Galvanic, (the seizure of Makin and Tarawa Atolls in the Gilbert Islands). While cruising near Butaritari Island, a single torpedo from Japanese submarine I-175 struck the escort carrier near the stern. The aircraft bomb magazine detonated a few moments later, sinking the warship within minutes.<br /><br />In 1973, the USS Miller (FF-1091), a Knox-class frigate, was named in honor of Doris Miller.<br /><br />The Full Story<br /><br />Doris Miller, known as \\"Dorie\\" to shipmates and friends, was born in Waco, Texas, on 12 October 1919, to Henrietta and Conery Miller. He had three brothers, one of which served in the Army during World War II. While attending Moore High School in Waco, he was a fullback on the football team and he worked on his father's farm.<br /><br />On 16 September 1939, he enlisted in the U.S Navy as Mess Attendant, Third Class, at Dallas, Texas, so he could travel, and earn money for his family. He later was commended by the Secretary of the Navy, was advanced to Mess Attendant, Second Class and First Class, and subsequently was promoted to Ship's Cook, Third Class.<br /><br />Following training at the Naval Training Station, Norfolk, Virginia, Miller was assigned to the ammunition ship USS Pyro (AE-1) where he served as a Mess Attendant.<br /><br />On 2 January 1940 was transferred to USS West Virginia (BB-48), where he became the ship's heavyweight boxing champion.<br /><br />In July 1940 he had temporary duty aboard USS Nevada (BB-36) at Secondary Battery Gunnery School.<br /><br />On August 3 1940, he returned to West Virginia, and was serving in that battleship when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941.<br /><br />On 7 December 1941, Miller had arisen at 6 a.m., and was collecting laundry when the alarm for general quarters sounded. He headed for his battle station, the antiaircraft battery magazine amidship, only to discover that torpedo damage had wrecked it, so he went on deck. Because of his physical prowess, he was assigned to carry wounded fellow Sailors to places of greater safety.<br /><br />Then an officer ordered him to the bridge to aid the mortally wounded Captain of the ship.<br /><br />He subsequently manned a 50 caliber Browning anti-aircraft machine gun until he ran out of ammunition and was ordered to abandon ship.<br /><br />Miller described firing the machine gun during the battle, a weapon which he had not been trained to operate: \\"It wasn't hard. I just pulled the trigger and she worked fine. I had watched the others with these guns. I guess I fired her for about fifteen minutes. I think I got one of those Jap planes. They were diving pretty close to us.\\"<br /><br />During the attack, Japanese aircraft dropped two armored piercing bombs through the deck of the battleship and launched five 18-inch aircraft torpedoes into her port side. Heavily damaged by the ensuing explosions, and suffering from severe flooding below decks, the crew abandoned ship while West Virginia slowly settled to the harbor bottom. Of the 1,541 men on West Virginia during the attack, 130 were killed and 52 wounded. Subsequently refloated, repaired, and modernized, the battleship served in the Pacific theater through to the end of the war in August 1945.<br /><br />Miller was commended by the Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox on 1 April 1942, and on 27 May 1942 he received the Navy Cross, which Fleet Admiral (then Admiral) Chester W. Nimitz, the Commander in Chief, Pacific Fleet personally presented to Miller on board aircraft carrier USS Enterprise (CV-6) for his extraordinary courage in battle. Speaking of Miller, Nimitz remarked:<br /><br />This marks the first time in this conflict that such high tribute has been made in the Pacific Fleet to a member of his race and I'm sure that the future will see others similarly honored for brave acts.<br /><br />On 13 December 1941, Miller reported to USS Indianapolis (CA-35), and subsequently returned to the west coast of the United States in November 1942. Assigned to the newly constructed USS Liscome Bay (CVE-56) in the spring of 1943, Miller was on board that escort carrier during Operation Galvanic, the seizure of Makin and Tarawa Atolls in the Gilbert Islands. Liscome Bay's aircraft supported operations ashore between 20-23 November 1943. At 5:10 a.m. on 24 November, while cruising near Butaritari Island, a single torpedo from Japanese submarine I-175 struck the escort carrier near the stern. The aircraft bomb magazine detonated a few moments later, sinking the warship within minutes. Listed as missing following the loss of that escort carrier, Miller was officially presumed dead 25 November 1944, a year and a day after the loss of Liscome Bay. Only 272 Sailors survived the sinking of Liscome Bay, while 646 died.<br /><br />In addition to the Navy Cross, Miller was entitled to the Purple Heart Medal; the American Defense Service Medal, Fleet Clasp; the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal; and the World War II Victory Medal.<br /><br />Commissioned on 30 June 1973, USS Miller (FF-1091), a Knox-class frigate, was named in honor of Doris Miller.<br /><br />On 11 October 1991, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority dedicated a bronze commemorative plaque of Miller at the Miller Family Park located on the U.S. Naval Base, Pearl Harbor.nd suffering from severe flooding below decks, the crew abandoned ship while West Virginia slowly settled to the harbor bottom.

076790592X|4.0|I loved this book.  It had a lot of lessons about life that I hadn't really thought of before.  I thought Morrie was courageous and it was inspiring that he kept his sense of humor throughout his ordeal.  But I wish there had been more about Morrie's wife.  She was there when the reporter and the TV cameras weren't.  She must have been a strong and wonderful woman.  But we don't know much about her.  Anyway, it is definitely worth reading.
B00003CXDD|5.0|When I first saw Willow I was 14-15 years old, and I loved it so much, in fact it was my movie of choice that year every time we went to the video store, you know \\"Its Laura's turn to pick the movie..Oh Willow again? Yeesh\\" My father would choose to work in the garage that night for some reason, he never was into the fantasy movies, unless it was \\"Debbie Does the Enchanted Forest\\". I fell in love with Val Kilmer, I had seen him in Top Gun, and Real Genius, but MadMartagen pulled me under. I realized even then that it was ripping off a lot of Fantasy Genre Icons, like Maleficent from snow white, The frozen people in Sleeping Beauty, Even Skelletor from He-man, but it all worked out to be an original vision overall. The effects were good then, and they hold up pretty good now, I cant ever get the \\"Change me back wiiillllooww\\" out of my head, and knowing that Val Kilmer was falling in love with Joanne Whalley at the time makes that relationship more believable (too bad that didn't work out for Joanne).

B00079FUI6|5.0|When I first saw snippets of this show, I was intrigued by the idea of an evening soap opera.  I don't know what makes that so special - there's been a bunch of them (\\"Dallas\\", \\"Knots Landing\\", \\"Melrose Place\\" and the like).  I guess it's because there hasn't been an evening soap opera in YEARS.  Everything released by the networks has been reality based or true crime or medically related.<br /><br />I was deliciously surprised and overwhelmed by the multiple plot lines, personalities, devious doings, and twisting turns!  It's a great piece of fantasy to immerse yourself in.  I hadn't really seen Teri Hatcher in anything since \\"Lois and Clark\\" and Felicity Huffman is the perfect frazzled mom.<br /><br />I'm just VERY glad I don't live on Wysteria Lane.  That's too much drama for this ordinary housewive.
B00005JMX6|4.0|I was quite pleasantly surprised by this one.  It was excellent!  Funny, when I saw the previews on television, for many weeks, I kept thinking: this really reminds me of the movie Risky Business.  I never saw it in the theaters.<br /><br />I enjoyed how this movie was set up: very unique to make the \\"nerd\\" a President of the school.  I always remember the president of my schools being the \\"cool\\" kids.  Emile is the president, but hangs with some wanabee cool kids, who don't quite fit in with the jocks, etc.<br /><br />Of course Emile Hirsch is very attractive, which helps move the story on, so the nerd image only holds for a little bit.  Elisha Cuthbet is also excellent as the girl next door, and potential girlfriend of our hero, the Hirsch character.<br /><br />I like Emile's buddies, and they also help to carry the story.  I enjoyed the \\"road trip\\" to Vegas to attend the Porn convention, and that has been one of my regular fantasies to attend that show, so it was cool seeing it (or at least the movie version.)  I wonder how many extras were actually porn stars?<br /><br />I really noticed how many similarities there are between this movie and Risky Business.  I didn't read every review, but nobody that I read, gave all the similarities, so I thought that might be a unique approach.  So here are the similarities that I found.  I guess you might consider them homage to the original.<br /><br />Risky Business featured a unique non-vocal soundtrack by Tangerine Dream, that featured prominently in the movie, especially the sex scenes (remember \\"making love on a real train?\\")  A small clip of this exact music played during the scene when the friends of the Cuthbet character (other porn stars) are being introduced to the parents of the Hirsch character, when pictures are being taken before they go to the prom.<br /><br />Both movies involve the male character being tricked and seduced in various ways (Tom Cruise has his parent's car dropped in Lake Michigan; The Emile Hirsch character \\"loses\\" his clothes, and again finds himself naked, in his principal's pool.)<br /><br />Both male characters end up \\"recruiting\\" the ladies of the night, to help settle a huge debt.  (Tom hires the prostitutes, Emile hires the Porn actresses.)<br /><br />Both movies feature somewhat clueless friends of the main male character, who give him poor advice, and move him in a direction of complete failure to fix the problems.<br /><br />Both feature mean-spirited but knowledgeable \\"pimp\\" type managers.  Timothy Olyphant, one of my favorite characters, and a former classmate from my high school, really gives new meaning to the expression \\"low-life.\\"  (I promise, he's really a nice guy, take it from me.) While we never performed in any high-school plays together, he and his brother were quite the athletes, especially down at USC in his younger days. (I'm quite certain his brother was a tennis ace in our hometown of Modesto, California, and later in college at USC.)<br /><br />I'm sure there are many other similarities, but that's what I noticed.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend this one to any age older than 17.  It was a great movie!  Two Thumbs Up!!!finds himself naked, in his principal's pool.)    Both male characters end up \\"recruiting\\" the ladies of the night, to help settle a huge debt.

(I'm quite certain his brother was a tennis ace in our hometown of Modesto, California, and later in college at USC.)    I'm sure there are many other similarities, but that's what I noticed.    All in all, I highly recommend this one to any age older than 17.  It was a great movie!  Two Thumbs Up!!!
B00005JNQS|5.0|I just don't get it, I really don't!?!<br /><br />I got an advanced copy of this DVD, and went into it expecting it to be okay, and by the time the end credits ran, was a true fan of this remarkable film.<br /><br />What I DON'T get, is all of the mediocre reviews that I've since been reading on this film.<br /><br />The animation is incredible, the characters are alive, individuals, who you like and care about, and the story is fun and full of great gags, both sight and verbal.<br /><br />So, why all of the so-so reviews then?<br /><br />One reviewer mentioned the \\"Fart\\" jokes, as if this were a bad thing, I mean come on people, this is suppose to be a kids movie after all, and believe it or not, kids (and most adult males :) still find \\"Fart\\" jokes funny.<br /><br />Another reviewer felt that the story wasn't so much a story, but rather a bunch of gags strung together, which isn't true at all, as there is a story (be it a rather simple one, but a story none the less) with the gags helping to both flavor and move the story along.<br /><br />But the most amazing criticism that I read was that the animation was only so-so.<br /><br />First, let's take into consideration that the first film that this company produced was Ice Age, a film who's animation and character designs where of very low end quality (when you compare it to stuff like, Finding Nemo) and that this is only their second computer animated film, and you'll see what a HUGE jump in design and animation, has occurred.<br /><br />And secondly, even the much beloved, The Incredibles (which, up till, Robots, was my all time favorite computer animated film) is no match, in detail, to Robots, where every scene and character, is textured in rich detail, from shadow, to grease, to corrosion, to background action.<br /><br />And the gags, oh man, the gags are plentiful and hilarious, I mean, how can you not laugh when a robot, surrounded by an enemy bent on it's destruction, in sudden desperation, suddenly brakes into a Brittney Spears dance routine, thus distracting and destroying the enemy, in the process.<br /><br />And Robin Williams gets to have fun, ala Aladdin, being left to run wild, but also being edited, so that only the really funny and clever bits are kept in the film.<br /><br />So, do yourself a favor, and dismiss all of the mediocre reviews, and rent or buy this DVD.

0783229526|5.0|Terry Gilliam does the original book justice, within the limits of any film.  Thompson's narrative is ably delivered by Depp and the film captures the warped decadence of early 70's Vegas in a way you won't see anywhere else.  This film isn't for everyone, but if you get it, you'll love it.
0451169514|2.0|What a horrible ending to an almost brilliant book. I cannot fathom what King was thinking by ending the book in such an absurd, senseless and gratuitous manner. I needed an outlet after reading one of the longest books I have ever read and then having it shock, disappoint, and frustrate me all in the same breath: writing this review seemed the perfect solution.<br /><br />90% of the story was a masterpiece as other reviewers have described and by now the premise and plot of the book is very familiar to you; if not, the Spotlight review describes the story and lead characters perfectly. King's books, unlike his movies, are all about amazing, potent, and absolutely real characters that awful and horrifying things happen to-and this book was no exception. However, the last 10% of the book in all honesty was absurd: it was so absurd that the puzzles and mysteries throughout the story fell apart and were never really solved. In consequence, the whole book fell apart; even its earlier brilliance could not redeem it entirely.<br /><br />I cannot divulge the ending without ruining the book for you but what I will say is this: throughout the story the evil entity that It was seemed to manifest Itself and derive Its power from childrens' persistent belief of the \\"bogyman\\"; whatever \\"monster\\" the  child feared the most that's the face It would wear and show to the misfortunate child that happened to cross It's path-in short it was an evil of the Unknown; King also portrayed It as a haunting type of evil, but instead of haunting a house, It was haunting a whole city-Derry, Main. Unfortunately, King began to give It more power in the middle of the story and in one of the lead character's childhood memory, It took on a whole new type of entity: an outer-dimension, all-knowing and all-seeing entity. And the first question that pops into the reader's mind is that if that's what It really is, then why would such an evil and powerful creature ONLY RESIDE IN DERRY, MAINE? That whole premise was the beginning of the end of the book and its catastrophically bad ending. It even gets worse as the story tries but never delivers in tying \\"Its\\" loose-ends and de-mystifying \\"Its\\" conundrums.<br /><br />So go ahead, I know you will click on \\"no\\" when asked if this review was helpful or not since I gave the book a 2 star rating. But for once, I did not feel guilty writing a bad review on one of the greatest authors of our time.beginning of the end of the book and its catastrophically bad ending.

B000000H40|4.0|Obituary's sophmore effort isn't as good as their debut a year earlier, but it definitely doesn't suck. All the classic things to love about Obituary are still available here -bone crushing riffs, heavy mid-tempo drumming, and John Tardy's indeciferable voice. <br /> <br />Obituary also got a boost in the arm by acquiring session guitarist James Murphy recently of Death fame (ala Spiritual Healing). Murphy doesn't fit as well with the band as Alan West did, but some of the solos are slower and more harmonic. The general pace of the album is faster than 'Slowly We Rot' but there are still a lot of Sabbath-like dirges here and there. <br /> <br />There is also a cover of Celtic Frost's \\"Circle of the Tyrants\\" from the 'To Mega Therion' album. The \\"Cause of Death\\" tour in '90 was also very sucessful for Obituary and seeing how Sadus and Sepultura opened up for them it only got better. Still though, Obituary had yet to deliver the best album of their career...which would only wait another two years.  <br /> <br />A good place to start any (old-school) Death Metal collection and definitely worth owning.
B000001A3H|5.0|This is a must own for your collection, period.  It's great music and I hate catagorizing music other than good, great and crap i.e. <br />almost anything played by Clear Channel.  Buy it, enjoy it and figure out what what you like not have the man tell you what to like.
B000A6T1HC|5.0|This new release by Cecilia Bartoli is absolutely fantastic!!! It certainly establishes that she one of the most prominent singers of our time. Her initial Mozart and Rossini albums are beautiful, as are her more recent Gluck and Vivaldi albums. I was never really keen on Salieri though. But Opera Proibita has dispelled any doubts. I am a huge fan of Handel oratorio, and especially his early Italian works. La Ressurezione is a gorgeous work and Bartoli does extremely well with the 2 arias, equaling Emma Kirkby in her early recording with Hogwood. Lac'ia la spina is a real find aswell. The recently discovered works by Caldara and Scarlatti and no less intriguing. First Scarlatti track displays Bartoli's dazzling technique, and then her simplicity of tone in the proceeding aria. This compilation indicates that more works from this period should be performed, not just by Handel, but Scarlatti, Caldara, Vivaldi, Porpora, etc. The ensemble under the baton of Marc Minkowski admirably accompany Bartoli. I hope there will be many more recordings in come from this superb artist, from Baroque right through to the bel canto period! Bravo!
B000002KBA|5.0|yes deep purple considers 'in rock' as their finest effort!    great hard rock albums are those which succesfully reconcile heaviness with melody. this album is a forerunner in this genre marred only be mediocre sound reproduction.    the album kicks off with the ferocious 'speed king', where ian gillan, rocks greatest vocalist, snarls with reckless fury. the song also showcases the trademark guitar/organ duel between the \\"bach in black\\" and jon lord.    'bloodsucker' and 'into the fire' shine in the album with catchy riffs and intense screaming vocals by gillan.    'living wreck' is a hummable tune with a catchy bass line with some fantastic vocals by gillan.    but the highlight of the album is the slow to build up, legendary 'child in time' which showcases gillan as the undisputable king of rock vocalists.    ritchie blackmore is without doubt one of the greatest of the axemen in the history of rock and there're many moments in this album where his \\"pull off\\" wizardry shines through. but still this album is undeniably gillan's whose vocal prowess has simply no peer in the field.    deep purple would follow up in rock with an even more fantastic 'machine head' where the drummer ian paice would jump in to be counted amongst the band's geniuses.    you cannot call yourself a hard rock fan if you dont own this!    other dp recommended listening : machine head, fireball, burn and also 'deep purple - the early years' - which compiles material from the three pre-gillan albums.
B00025ETIW|5.0|this is a really great album. i think it's getting really old all that categorization of emo, hardcore, scene-whatever the hell else there is. IT'S JUST MUSIC. it's a fun album, and i like it tons..but i'm not emo or this or that or blah blah. just listen to it and if you like it then u like it. if u don't then you don't. there really is NO need to bash stereotypes and what not. you'll just look bitter and stupid.
B00005JNTX|5.0|First off, if you didn't know already, this movie is NOT for kids.  Ok, with that out of the way, I loved this movie.  I really did.  As one of the 3 people on the planet who hasn't read the graphic novels (at least thats the way it feels), this was my first trip into Sin City.  From the theme song (Cells by The Servent) to the use of color (the intro will show you what I mean), this movie was excellent.  The writing/dialog is fantastic, and the acting is perfect.  Some complained about Jessica Alba seeming lost, but I thought she fit her role just fine.  I actually thought Clive Owens voice seemed too monotone, but I'm sure thats exactly what Frank Miller was going for, so I am happy.  Now, here comes the REAL good stuff.  In an interview over at IGN, Frank Miller talks about sequels (\\"You ask if there will be a second, I ask if there will be a fifth.\\"), and the special edition they were putting together at the time of the interview.  This special edition really will be one, with TONS of extras, and interviews, not just a \\"making of\\" and a cast bio.  I can't wait for it to come out, but since I can't find any release dates for it, get the movie now (or rent it) if you really need your Sin City fix. <br /> <br />Can't wait for the special edition, and will meanwhile rent this a few more times.  Just love getting lost in the story!

0793542049|5.0|When I first purchased Building Walking Bass Lines, I knew how to read notes in the lower five frets of the bass, and played bass at a high beginner's level.  I'm also a full-time college teacher (business), so I know solid teaching of any kind when I see it.<br /><br />Unlike other books on walking bass lines I'd tried to learn from, this book got me walking over chord changes quickly and fluidly, and with a minimum amount of pain.<br /><br />Friedland gives a brief overview of how to read notes on the electric bass, briefly discusses how to construct chords, and then launches into the clearest and most gradual explanation of how to walk over chord changes I've ever seen.  He has a lot of \\"hands-on\\", play-along exercises at the end of each concept, and they're stripped of unecessary complexity so you can see the concepts clearly.<br /><br />A major strength of this book is how you see results in your playing immediately, which encourages you to keep practicing.  It's important for anyone learning something for the first time to see immediate progress in their ability, and Friedland has written this book to achieve just that.<br /><br />The exercises get more and more difficult as you go along, but were never out of reach for me.  The end of the book gives the chord changes to 10 jazz standards.<br /><br />After working through this book, I knew enough to hold my own in a gigging fusion band with some ex-music teachers and university graduates in music.<br /><br />Also, I found the concepts I learned in the this book made me a better rock and folk player, because I understood how to construct interesting bass lines under chords in any style -- all this was an outgrowth of my jazz knowledge gained from the book.<br /><br />Anyone who writes that this book is \\"too easy\\" or \\"too basic\\" is actually complementing Friedland, because it takes a master to dissect a complex topic into something everyone can understand.
B000002H33|5.0|I prefer Master of puppets over Ride The Lighting and ...And Justice For All. Here are my reasons. <br /> <br />Ride The Lighting is a very good album, with each song telling of different types of death. It even has my 3rd favorite Metallica song, Fade To Black. But A couple of songs (Trapped Under Ice, Escape)are only decent. Slightly simpler instrumentally, however it's very Good lyrically. 9/10  <br /> <br />...And Justice For All is also great lyrically. It has my 2nd favorite song, One, on it. But a few of their songs drag on way to long, and sound too much alike(Shortest Straw, Harvester of Sorrow.) If they'd just left Shortest Straw or Harvester of Sorrow off the cd, I'd probably give it a 10. <br />9.5/10 <br /> <br />Then there was Master of Puppets, Metallica's 3rd album. In my opinion, if I were to say Metallica had a masterpiece, this was it. Every song on here is distinct and has it's own theme. And every song kicks a$$.  And of course, there's Master of Puppets, my favorite Metallica song-though One and Fade To Black Come very close. <br />Lyrically, every song is distinct. On Ride the Lightning, every song was about death. On ...And Justice For All, every song was about...well, the lack of justice in the world. But on Master of Puppets, they kind of mix it up. Not 2 songs sound alike. <br /> <br />1Battery: Great intro, fastest song on the album about a gun ripping soldiers to pieces. <br />2Master of Puppets: Also very fast paced, great middle section, great solo. One of greatest metal songs of all time. Maybe about an addiction? <br />3Thing That Should Not Be: Great, slower paced song. About an evil being? <br />4Sanitarium: beautiful intro. Insightful song, though not as good as Fade To Black or One.  I'd prefer the title Welcome Home over Sanitarium. Lyrics won't haunt you, don't worry. About a person living in a Sanitarium. <br />5Disposable Heroes: Good song, drags on for too long though. Would be great if it ended 2 minutes earlier. About a soldier who has just been seriously injured in battle. <br />6Leper Messiah: Very catchy guittar rift, even though i may not agree with the lyrics, this may be the strongest song lyrically on here. I guess you could say Metallica's not a big fan of church. <br />7Orion: Great Instrumental. Not many bands could pull this off. <br />8Damage Inc.  Very slow intro, which kicks off into a very fast song. Shortest song on album, about 5 minutes. Short but sweet. <br /> <br />There you have it. Metallica doesn't really ever lose your attention on Master of Puppets, despite it being 54 min. long. With the exception of Disposable Heroes, they also never get too repetitive. And every song could be considered a classic, like Master of Puppets, if it were on any other cd. Thought it was sort of downhill after And Justice For All, No one will ever forget just how good Metallica was in their prime-Master of Puppets <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0393035158|4.0|I think one of the major strength's of Harris's analysis of the role of religion in terrorism is that he is not afraid to offend where necessary. And for the more rational among us--generally well-educated and, often, liberal--this claim is hard to absorb because we're so used to pointing out the real, deleterious effects of U.S. imperialism. Indeed, it was this point in particular that I found hard to swallow initially. That the U.S. has plenty to apologize for, Harris admits, is hardly a matter for debate.  But what he does well is point out how, in many ways, the issues are seperate. Sure the U.S. has done many things that it should be ashamed for, things that may contribute in the aggregate to the whole phenomenon of terrorism, but to ignore the role that religion plays is to exercize the same sort of rigid adherence to an irrational idea that zealots of any stripe can be accused of.  To this end, the logic of Harris's arguments is pretty solid and convincing. <br /> <br />The book manages to weave together from various points in history instances where religion was the culprit of pointless killing. And it's not just Islam he has a problem with: he makes the case that followers of Christianity have been the most violent and sadistic of any religion, and that Christianity's legacy, thus far, has been the bloodiest. (Judaism makes a brief cameo but it seems Harris has found it historically less violent as one of the big three.) The people who take up arms in the name of religion, Harris says, are not simply misinterpreting their religious texts as moderates claim, but interpreting them to the most literal extreme. Christianity in the West has been tempered by the Enlightenment and industrialization, so a more-or-less moderate posture is the norm. Islam, in contrast, is experiencing growing pains as it clashes with modernity. And in an era when it's possible for the most industrious of terrorists (who tend to be overwhelmingly Islamicists) to obtain a weapon that'scapable of killing many, many more than a few airplanes or bombs on a train can, it behooves the rational among us to point out how absurd all beliefs are that allow or lead to this sort of behavior.  <br /> <br />But the book certainly has its flaws. At one point Harris attempts to make the case that it is ethically justifiable, indeed imperative, to torture a suspected terrorist if the information extracted will prevent people from dying in the long run. On its face, the argument may be sound. As an effective, long-term tool against terrorism, however, I would think the results are impossible to quantify. How many terrorists, afterall, were recruited after seeing the images that came out of Abu Ghraib? The moral calculus required for this ethical problem is simply more complicated than Harris allows and would've been better left out. <br /> <br />Other potentially muddy territory that Harris ventures into is his endorsement of some forms of mysticism and meditation. I don't want to say too much on this point except that I think that Harris merely wants to emphasize the quantifiable benefits that meditation has for its practitioners. Since meditation is not, strictly speaking, a form of prayer but a method of breathing and focusing attention inwardly, it is not necessarily religious activity. Nor would it then smack of hypocrisy on Harris's part to mention it. Some readers may choose to believe that it is too problematic and subtracts from the coherence of the author's overall argument. While this point has its merits and points out where the book is gray, I think it is sufficiently addressed by the author and amounts to an addition rather than a subtraction to the book. <br /> <br />On balance, this is a very compelling and well-reasoned polemic. If you're interested in contemporary religious issues, this book should definitely be on your to-read list.
0140187537|4.0|John Steinbeck is one of those writers who get in your face, who engage you in passionate conversation, if not downright argument, almost as soon as you turn the first page. I read this book in a paperback version, printed in 1962, whose dogeared cover featured an angry young man in tie and shirtsleeves, seated; a sleazy cigarette-smoking blonde, standing behind him with her arm over his shoulder; and another woman, younger and more wholesome, profiled in the rear. I loved this book and found it laughable at the same time, and the fact that I couldn't wait to finish it and write this review is, I think, a testimonial to its singular kind of greatness.<br /><br />What kind is that? The greatness of perversity. Although Steinbeck meant this book to be a stern-browed statement on How We Live in America, Today -- as if tomorrow would never come -- forty-odd years later \\"Winter\\" is a remarkable antique, a pitch-perfect evocation of its much-ballyhooed era.  Here are all the usual fifties tropes: neighbors all knew and spoke to each other, every kid had a mom and a dad, families stayed put for generations, corner bank, corner grocery -- and here is Steinbeck happily blowing them all to smithereens, reveling in the locals' hypocrisy, corruption, and xenophobia, having a splendid time steering his virtuous hero -- one Ethan Allen Hawley, something of an UberW.A.S.P. -- around various tempting and lethal shoals, pullling off a grandstanding switcheroo ending in which the hero's fate remains unclear till the last sentence.<br /><br />So why was it laughable? Because Steinbeck's ripsnorting righteous exposure, of course, is as worn-out as the plasticated happy-days delusion it condemns. \\"Winter\\"'s world is deader than Dickens, buried under so many layers of historical effluvia -- electronics and mass media, computers, feminism, relativism in all its forms, the end of the Cold War -- that even those old enough to remember those times groan aloud over this Ozymandias of a novel. Was there really a time when a man could talk nonstop in graduate-level literary references to a wife who appeared to have the I.Q. of a chipmunk? After I identified the 13th Shakespearean nugget in the one-sided banter of overeducated Ethan and his acorn-brained wife, I found myself wondering whether the right medication might have made Steinbeck more ready to edit himself (for the record, I doubt it). Would the nation snatch up as an instant celebrity a fourteen-year-old boy who'd won honorable mention -- honorable mention! And one of five at that -- in a patriotic essay contest?  Was there actually, and did I live in, a time when the federal government would -- on an anonymous tip -- dispatch agents to hunt down one -- one! -- illegal alien? (I must admit I bonded at once with the grocer Marullo. He was after all the only ethnic in the book, and like Steinbeck's diverse Californians magnificently rendered). And was there ever a town mattress as friendly and presentable and prescient as Margie Young-Hunt? Why, this gal sleeps with every man in town, from the not-so-picturesque local drunk to the police chief, and no doubt the dogcatcher; and upstanding Ethan and his doe-eyed wife leave their CHILDREN with her for the weekend.<br /><br />Steinbeck's rendition of the Hawley children -- actually teenagers -- remind me of Timothy Leary's remark, made in the early 70s: \\"the genocidal hatred of a generation for its young.\\" Allen and Ellen Hawley are nasty brats, but their parents barely seem to notice their existence, and when they do, it is mostly to plot an escape from the troublesome offspring.  There is, throughout the novel, an almost palpable antipathy on the part of Ethan Hawley toward his son. Allen is unpromising, to say the least, but one wonders what he and his sister might or might not have been, if someone had bothered to love them, or at the minimum make their acquaintance.<br /><br />The tight-lipped coldness of these people ... UberW.A.S.P. is an understatement. These people eat ham and cheese with butter AND mayo, they wash down onion sandwiches with bottles of milk. Ethan Hawley drinks a martini and straight away praises the brew as a \\"sacrament.\\" Here we have men and women who don't argue; they just fold their lips like Jo in \\"Little Women\\" and retreat into another room, or a drunk night. By the ethos of this novel, or that of the culture it purports to represent, it is better to be drunk in public than to display sober emotion. In some ways, Steinbeck's New Baytown's as exotic as Bhutan.<br /><br />The book works anyway, and I repeat I loved it, in large part because Steinbeck took such loving and inspired effort in its construction. Hawley's genealogy, the DNA cross he must carry, is its own potentially fascinating, if not entirely original, story.  His motives and actions are consistent, as well as psychologically sound. The narrative/P.O.V. switches are seamless, and in fact I barely noticed the shifts from third-person to first and ] back again.  While in good old reliable Steinbeck the reader always knows where he/she \\"is\\" -- no somersaults in time, no leapfrogging back and forth in the mode of Joyce or Conrad -- those who seek will discover envelope-pushing aplenty.  Withheld information, delayed description, shell games with various characters, all testify to Steinbeck's monumental storytelling power.  Dated and ridiculous as \\"Winter\\" may be, the novel is not about its setting in space and time. Ethan Hawley may be an annoying and motormouthed snob, but the reader wants to like him, wants him to end with some money in his pocket and some pride in his arid heart. Steinbeck, the writer, gets into your face; his characters creep deeper, and stay there.tatement.

B0006L16N8|5.0|Of course Coldplay does it  again and beats its last album and makes Coldplay that much better. I really like coldplay there songs are very meaning full and are not just random stuff put together (Example Coldplay threw out tons of songs that they did not like to put on this album). Coldplay is also really dedicated to ther music and fans. They are very careing and they really love to make music. Some of the best songfs on here are: <br /> <br />Square One <br />What If <br />Fix You <br />Talk <br />Speed of Sound <br />Low <br />Swallowed In The Sea <br /> <br />One of there main hits on this album Speed of Sound was probably so popular because it is very similar to CLocks there smash hit on A Rush of Blood To the Head. Anyway get this it is great and is another perfect ablbum from Coldplay keep up the good work guys.

Rather than being chalk full of anecdotal evidence and unsupported claims it presents a very easy to understand and readable overview of hard-core, objective scientific research.  The author is not trying to sell you anything.  He presents the results of extensive scientific research on the affects of nutrition on disease.  What you do with this information is your business, but if you strive for a high quality, disease-free life, you'll appreciate the information presented in this book.

B00005JNTX|5.0|What a fantastic movie!  Not usually a big fan of ultra violent movies but this movie got me absolutely hooked all the way through.  Would highly recommend this....
0060586230|3.0|I'll start by letting you know that I read the book about ten years ago. I was looking through my libraries meager selections of books on CD and happened to see this, and having always been a fan of Kurt V. I decided to give it another go. <br /> <br />Have you ever heard Stanley Tucci act? No, I guess you mostly see him act, if you even know who he is. While he reads this book, it seems like just that: reading. I have listened to many books and most of the time the reader is a skilled storyteller. Stanley, I am sorry to say, is not. He gives no difference to any of the characters in the book; they all sound just like him talking. This was not my favorite Vonnegut book to begin with and Tucci's voice did not make it any better. <br /> <br />This novel reminds me of life as a train wreck. One can see Kurt at the throttle of his locomotive, plowing over all the characters while heading towards its ultimate derailment at the end of the book. I do not know his personal situation at the time of writing, but I'm guessing that he was drinking heavily and having suicidal thoughts. I am surprised he didn't kill himself after sobering up a few years later and finally reading this, because he obviously did not proof it. <br /> <br />Vonnegut has stated that this is one of his least favorite books. So, if you have to read them all than go ahead. At the very least, it will give you insight into the mind of a genius. <br />
B00076ZZ9I|5.0|I can't claim to be a complete hard-core AC/DC fan. I've always loved the stuff they play on the radio, but I don't think I'm as much a fan as most people who have reviewed this edition of \\"Back In Black\\". Having said that....    Review Part I: The album is awesome, but we all know that. Three of my favorite AC/DC songs are on it - \\"Hells Bells\\", \\"Back In Black\\", and \\"You Shook Me...\\". I remember my Aunt bought this when it first came out(!). Considering I always listened to her Beatles albums when over her house, this album was quite a change in gears. I can't say I loved it right then and there, but I knew there were some good tunes on it. \\"Back In Black\\" was my first exposure to AC/DC, so I never knew there was an original singer before Brian Johnson. I wasn't aware of this until I hit high school and my musician buddies enlightened me to Bon Scot. As a result, for ME, Brian Johnson was always THE singer for AC/DC, and \\"Back In Black\\" was their first truly great album - even though I appreciate that this is not the case for many out there who may be reading this.    Review Part II: I'm not sure why this edition is getting so many poor ratings. The audio CD copied over just fine to my iTunes, and then onto my iPod with no problems whatsoever...... and this DVD feature - which I am watching as I write this - is pretty cool. It's as good as anything I've seen on VH1(!), and I did not detect ANY glitches in the playback of the DVD video portion of this disc.    I have not run into anything that would cause me to give this CD anything less than what it deserves: 5 stars.    If you haven't bought \\"Back In Black\\" yet and have been thinking of buying it soon, you'd not be making a mistake purchasing this edition. But, if you don't need the \\"risk\\" of problems, then just buy the CD format.
038551123X|4.0|This and much more alliteration await you in this first chronicle of Dexter and his \\"dark passenger\\". Dexter is the brainchild of first-time author Jeff Lindsey. This makes me wonder about a person who seems so well in tune with the sociopathic mind. You see, Dexter is a serial killer, not just any serial killer. He only kills other, more heinous killers (killers of kids and helpless women, so far). He meticulously seeks out and tracks these evil doers while in the process of making a living at the Miami police office, as a blood splatter analysis technician. Oddly, Dexter hates blood! <br /> <br />The story follows Dexter as a new killer enters town. This normally doesn't bother Dex but this new killer seems to be following him, and even taunting him to the point of breaking into his apartment and leaving him clues as to his identity. <br /> <br />Now, at first I thought the story was a little rushed and I wanted more background on this awesome character. I was willing to attribute this to first time author folly. However, I have recently seen that Lindsey is writing a series of books about Dexter and fleshes out his past and family history more thoroughly. <br /> <br />Highly recommended to anyone who loves dark humor (Palahniuk is a good example). I can't wait to read the next! <br />
0553208845|5.0|This book is great since it was given as a part of high reading list. Talks about how siddhartha came to be and what paths he had to take to become enlightened. Besides reading this book for school purpose, it gave me a better outlook for being a buddhist. So read it if u must for a enlightened feeling.
B00082IJ08|5.0|The first time I listened to this was on my way to work. I wasn't very impressed, songs two and three begin with the same line is sung over and over, that ploy is used throughout the cd. I couldn't tell the songs apart on my first listen. It didn't help that when I got bored, I would skip to the next song. <br /> <br />Thankfully, it was the only cd I had at work and the antenna of my radio is broken. This left one option, to listen to this cd over and over again. The backgrounds, too subtle for the truck ride, were entrancing, and I wondered how I ever thought they sounded similar. After repeated listening, my appreciation for Demon Days only grew. <br /> <br />If you do get this don't expect a rehash of their first outing, Danger Mouse brings his own style to the table. You may just have to sit around that table a few times to get the full effect. Do not judge after one listen, as I almost did. <br />
B0007GAEW6|2.0|I like at the drive-in.  I like Tremulant.  I like De-Loused.  Up until this album, i liked pretty much everything Cedric and Omar had a hand in(not counting De Facto and that atrocious solo album Omar did)-but this, i just cant get behind this album.      De-loused walked a thin line very well.  They knew when to jam out, and they knew when to keep the song under 7 minutes.  I give Rick Rubin alot of credit for this, because the second he left it all went to hell.    The truth of the matter is, through this over-wrought mess of an album, the only band member who's talent still shines through is the drummer, Jon.  Omar took over production duties, and that, i believe, is the biggest downfall of the album.  He cant produce...Hell, he can barely play guitar.  His personal weakeness really stand out here, and his lack of musical knowledge brings the entire album down with it, because he's helming the whole thing.    this album is 77 minutes long.  a good 40 of that is spend making us listen to random guitar noodling and birds chirping.  Are they trying to make the album like seeing them live?  If you've ever seen them live, you can only hope thats NOT what theyre trying to do, because their live shows could bore an amsih family to tears.      This album makes one thing quite clear: Omar cant be succesful on his own.  He just isnt good enough.  He needs someone with more knowledge and experience to hold his hand through the process.      the only song i dont have any problems with is l'via l'viaquez, it's a rockin track.  But Cygnus is way too unfocused and sloppy with horribly off-key solos by loveable omar that ruin any quality it has, the widow is just plain bad, miranda is unbelievably bland, and cassandra gemini is 15 songs congealed together to create one 30 minute pile of dung.      As the Mars Volta expand in members(they apparently have like 15 now? And are they all as useful as Marcel, standing on stage with his shirt off banging tambourines that arent even miced?), and as their names JUST KEEP GETTING LONGER, their music is getting worse.  Their own ambitions and egos are really sending them in an awful direction, and it's a horrible shame to see talented people like jon, juan and ikey get overshadowed by the less talented members of the band.
0375507256|5.0|I hope that 'Ford' is just the word that replaced 'car' or 'vehicle' in one of the most interesting portions (a corporate controlled, clone fueled Korea) of Mitchell's most recent work. It is also sad that most who start out reading this may never make it to that story. I myself would have never finished Cloud Atlas if I had not been listening to it on compact disk to supplement the book.  <br />  <br />The first couple of stories, while interesting to me, are in a highly stylized lexicon that may put off many readers. The first such story takes place in the 1850's and is that of Adam Ewing, who is on an expedition in the Pacific Ocean. If you're used to the dialogue and situations of most TV shows you'll be scratching your head and cursing the dork that recommended this to you. So, let me save you the trouble of trying to read this. That way you will not miss that rerun of Desperate Housewives you've been dying to watch. <br /> <br />The six stories in all follow the pattern a-b-c-d-e-f-e-d-c-b-a. During the first time through (a through f), the stories are cut off in mid stride. A trick so brilliant that I do not think I could have stopped reading/listening if I wanted to. I needed to get to the second half of the book (f through a) to discover the conclusions of the first half. <br /> <br />Many reviewers have tried to link the many incidences of coincidence that occur thru out the stories. Some think this novel is a diatribe against the evils of corporations. They may be correct. I, on the other hand, believe Mitchell just wants to tell a great story while exemplifying the '6-degrees of separation' as functioning through the course of time. All of the narrators and characters link to one another in small, almost random ways. Mitchell's explanation of this is not forth coming and seems to be the topic of debate among reviewers. Thus, in my opinion adding to the novels appeal. <br /> <br />I would highly recommend this to any Neal Stevenson fan (esp. of the Baroque Cycle) or any erudite reader with a considerable attention span. Happy reading. <br />
0553573403|4.0|I usually avoid so-called 'epic' fantasy on the grounds that it's nearly always cliched and overly convoluted. I found Tolkien horribly boring and confusing (and no, I am neither stupid nor a lazy reader - I expect books to be entertaining and Tolkien was not), and since a lot of the fantasy you see is little different, at least in terms of flaws, I keep a safe distance.<br /><br />And now to Game of Thrones. It's convoluted and very, very, complicated... but it's good. In Tolkien I lost track of the characters because there were a lot of them and none of them were very distinctive. But in Game of Thrones, though there were dozens of people to keep track of, every one of them stood out. I have a bad memory for names, but whenever a character reappeared in a chapter I'd think 'so... who's this guy again?'. Then the character would speak some dialogue, and I'd think 'oh, yeah! That guy! I remember him!'<br /><br />That's how much they stand out. They're so well-drawn and vivid that you recognise their faces, if not their names. Beats me how Martin does it, but he ought to be given some sort of medal for it.<br /><br />The plot is complicated with lots of characters all moving about and constantly changing their place and current motivation, but you're willing to put in the mental effort needed to keep track of it all. I usually grow impatient if a novel's plot is confusing, but in Game of Thrones I was so intent on not missing anything that I was willing to work at it. In short, Martin made me a willing partner in his scheme. You sure as hell can't buy reader loyalty like that. You've got to be good. And Martin is. Oh, yeah.<br /><br />Much of what happens isn't pretty - some of the violence and X-rated stuff made me cringe - but it's not there for it's own sake. It adds an edge raw reality that only enhances the reading experience. So this book is hard work, but worth it. The only reason I give it four stars is because Martin is a little careless sometimes about setting the scene- I kept forgetting wher the characters were.kept forgetting wher the characters were.
0060922583|5.0|This book enjoys a respectable sales ranking at Amazon.com after nearly fifteen years in print, and for good reason.  It was decades ahead of its time, and the world is only now starting to catch up with the quantum theorists.  I am one of the Johnny-Come-Latelies to this field, and what an introduction it is!  If you saw the indie documentary What the Bleep Do We Know?!, here is the extra meat that you hungered for afterwards.  Talbot begins by introducing the scientists and their extraordinary evidence suggesting that our universe operates like a hologram.  Talbot does so in a highly readable way that non-scientists like me can easily understand.  From there, he demonstrates how all sorts of phenomena, from the mundane to the extraordinary, can be explained by the holographic model.  Every page is fascinating, and the author provides many resources for further exploration.  It is not often that a book comes along that can fundamentally change a person's view of reality overnight, and this is one of them.  I encourage everyone to catch up with the \\"quantum folks.\\"  This book is the perfect start.
B00008BRB5|5.0|Let's go through this one track by track.  It starts off with the catchy Synchronicity I, which should have been a single.  It's energetic, to say the least.  Walking In Your Footsteps wonders if humans are destined for extinction like the dinosaurs were, and O My God demands to know why God seems to be so distant from the world.  It reuses a verse from \\"Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic.\\"  Mother is strange -- I envision Sting singing it while clawing at his face.  I'm apparently one of the few people who actually likes it.  Miss Gradenko is a quick song about a woman who has been \\"letting her feelings show\\" in some place where this may not be safe for her to do. <br /> <br />That's five songs out of eleven.  So far it's a decent album, but except for Synchronicity I, nothing special.  But this is where it gets good, with the best second half of an album I've ever heard. <br /> <br />Synchronicity II has good music, but the lyrics make it great -- Sting spends the last 45 seconds of this repeating \\"Many miles away\\" and with every repetition, the monster of the dark Scottish loch gets closer to the suburban father with his aching eyeballs.  Every Breath You Take is one of those songs everybody knows, and almost everybody likes.  The lyrics are simple without being trite, and I'm too young for radio overplay to have ruined it for me.  King of Pain isn't clearly about anything, but the images create a painful mood as they should.  I would pick it as the best song on the album.  Wrapped Around Your Finger, with its story of total power reversal, always gets me motivated to totally outplay someone at poker and leave them psychologically (and financially) destroyed -- turn their face to alabaster.  (Did I mention I'm competitive?  And I'm not that good yet.  I just want to be.) <br /> <br />Tea in the Sahara is a little close to inaudible unless I turn the volume up after Wrapped Around Your Finger, but the wispy lyrics draw me in.  It would have been a good final track (and, I understand, originally was) but Murder By Numbers is good too.  Sting follows a serial killer developing, from \\"making a stone out of [his] heart\\" to -- in a surprise twist -- \\"becoming the leader of the land.  For murder is the sport of the elected -- you don't need to lift a finger of your hand.\\"  The religious fundamentalists who accused this song of being \\"written by Satan\\" back when it was the B-side of \\"Every Breath You Take\\" completely missed the point, as usual.  Governments have always been the greatest murderers of all. <br /> <br />And that's it.  I'd give a 3.5 or so for the first five songs, but a 6 for the rest -- none of the last six songs is short of great.  That averages to a 4.75, so a 5 is what this gets.  As my title says, this is a great album.
B0002B15PG|2.0|One measure is what I draw from a movie.  For the life of me, I can remember little but Crow hanging from the riggings, powder smoke, some island research and wine drinking.  That's it.  No catchy phrases, no memorable scenes.  Nothing.   <br />    Its been probably eighteen months since I viewed the film.  At the time I thought is was a bit dull.  I served in the modern submarine navy and I think a film about the sub during even my time on board would have proven more interesting.   <br />    Good production value, though.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Its the kind of bench mark you use to see if a girl has half a brain or is a dappy t@rt. ou ask them do they like Green day, they either say not really, or yeh I like some of their stuff in which case you give them the all clear or you get the girl who will list Green Day as one of her favourite bands of all time in which case they're usually worth avoiding. <br /> <br />I find this album is excellent at weeding out that kind of girl. <br />Simple fact is that this album is brilliant if you've just put two gaping big holes in your ears and wear a tie or you are a girl looking in the mirror wondering what those lumps on her chest are. <br /> <br />Three cheers for the guy who said buy a Led Zeppelin Album! <br />Oh look a box to tick beneath where you write the review just to say if you're over the age of 13, I can't imaghine too many of the other people who reviewed this album get the pleasure of ticking that box. <br /> <br />If you're realy just a fan of pop music and remember buying a spice girls or robbie williams album back in the day then this is a great album for you to buy and claim you are being rebellious. <br /> <br />Its when 50'000 people all chant \\"I want to be in the minority\\" that I just cry with laughter. <br />Why buy this album when you could burn your money and enjoy the warmth and light it provides, its much more worthwhile, you could roast small sausages over it, think about it.
B00001IVOF|5.0|This CD is straight fire. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Every track is hard to me.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|A few years ago, when i first saw this movie, i absolutely loved it!! Now that i have the \\"bootleg\\" edition, i love the movie even more! the extra footage is great at adding more depth to the characters and to the story!! if you're a big fan of the movie as i am, you should definitely pick this up!!
B00005RHGL|5.0|In my opinion this movie if not the best, but one of the best modern day westerns I have ever seen.  I have seen several versions of the Wyatt Earp story, but this by far is my favorite!  Val Kilmer is the best Doc Holiday and Kurt Russell is a great Wyatt Earp.  I had previously watched it on VHS, but having this director's cut DVD with all the extras is so much better.
0452284392|3.0|First and foremost, Barabasi's writing style comes as a pleasant surprise as it skillfully explains intricate ideas in simpler terms. From technical networks utilizing microprocessors to personal networks facilitated by notions such as the \\"six degrees of separation\\", it provides adequate clarification to those like me who may not be well versed in networking concepts. While I'll admit I do not grasp every concept in its entirety, the basic theories of nodes, links and hubs are very comprehensible and their relevance to telecommunication and interpersonal communication is overwhelming.<br /><br />Furthermore, I believe the real world examples Barabasi provides concerning \\"scale-free\\" networks work well and adequately clarifies his outlook. This book also passionately sheds light on the importance of how nearly all \\"networks\\" operate in identical ways. On a personal note, I find the relationships between such networks to be more apparent in my interactions with the East-West Center (E.W.C.) [...] of which I am affiliated. Linked exemplifies how \\"traditional\\" E.W.C. networks are efficiently reinforced by newer technological networking capabilities (i.e. The World-Wide-Web). If nothing else, Linked will invoke an inevitable contemplation as to the vital roles in which different networks play in our daily lives. So then, one must ask: Is this interwoven connectivity of infinite networks a \\"new science\\"?<br /><br />Get Linked and find out.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|I've lost most of my coolness after my third kid- I can admit that. That is how it happened that I'd never even heard of Death Cab for Cutie until my (single and \\"out there\\") best friend from Philly introduced me to this incredible band from Seattle. After listening to \\"Soul Meets Body\\" for the first time, I do believe I feel a resonable facsimile of my former self seeping into my veins.<br /><br />  It's difficult to put a label on DCFC, as their sound rings familiar, yet unique. For example, \\"Different Names for the Same Thing\\" reminds me of an early Crowded House. \\"I Will Follow You Into the Dark\\" has lead singer Benjamin Gibbard (who writes all the songs) sounding vaugely like Paul Simon, while the lyrics are as off-beat as They Might Be Giants. \\"Summer Skin\\" reminds me a bit of The Samples. It's easy to tell who DCFC's influences may have been, but their sound is all their own. There are certainly more ballad-like songs than on their other CD's, but even still, \\"Plans\\" doesn't disappoint. Bottom line: this is CD that will quickly become a staple in your car/computer/etc.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|Gilmore Girls Season 3 never fails to entertain and delight.  Funny, smart, and emotional.  I loved it!
0684800713|5.0|\\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is without doubt the novel that propelled Hemingway into stellar heights. The autobiographical tones give this book a warm feeling that embraces you with every turn of the page.<br /><br />Jake Barnes, the main character, is the archetypical intellectual of the lost generation. He lives in Paris and associates with other expatriates, while trying to distract himself through excessive drinking. Long way from Kansas, working as a correspondent, Jake tries to find meaning in life after the Great War.<br /><br />And then there is Brett, the liberated heroine that makes every man who crosses her path crawl to her feet. The dynamics of Jake and Brett's relationship go beyond carnal desires. Jake's impotency turns the situation into a platonic affair that stretches through the entire storyline.<br /><br />The only way that Jake can overcome his suffering is by trying to find strength in the daily activities. He is a manly man. He likes fishing, hunting, binge-drinking, and most-dearly bullfighting. Hemingway goes into detail describing the excessive partying that goes with the \\"running of the bulls\\" event in the Basque country. It is understood that \\"The Great Gatsby\\" influenced Hemingway when he wrote this account.<br /><br />The most impressive aspect of the novel is the language without a doubt. The short and sharp sentences paint an image in one's head, very similar to an impressionist painting. Reading this book is almost like walking through an art gallery where all the pictures are smoothly related. There are great philosophical observations that are going to make you want to close the book and reflect about them for a few minutes.<br /><br />Highly recommended for all recent classics lovers.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|Achilles was known as the immortal created by the dark waters of the river Styx. His heroic story reverberates across the centuries and is illuminated in the film, TROY. Director Wolfgang Petersen draws well on his extensive talent and has created an enormous masterpiece for audiences for years to come. Combining the enormous talents of such notables as Peter O'Toole, Eric Bana, Brian Cox, and Orlando Bloom the setting awakens with true panorama of both spectacle and historical value. The few flaws wound within the beautiful tapestry of the film are only apparent to those who have any knowledge of the works of Homer or studied classic antiquity. The most obvious is the intimate relationship between Achilles and his lover Patroclus. Also noticeable is the Spartan soldiers allowing women at their feast instead of their traditional partners. Other minor flaws consist of squeezing the ten year siege war into the space of two hours and of course, for the more aesthetic among us, the unattractive \\"Trojan Horse.\\" Nonetheless, the spectacular, panoramic fight scenes are impressive and magnificent. A classic film if ever there was one. ****  <br /> <br />
B00003CX9E|1.0|Maybe on the list of the ten worst pictures...but the best???? <br />Only for brainies out there.  I'm a little more down to earth than this.
B00000099Y|5.0|A strange phenomena - regardless how much new and talented music I listen to, Tool's Aenima\\" remains my favourite album that is always a joy to come back to. And not only a sensitive, but a cerebral joy as well. I mean, if you do not like deep, dark, cathartic and artsy music you might not get what Aenima is about, but why uderestimate yourself? <br /> <br />Aenima teaches you. Not only to have self-respect and dignity, but to be aware what's going on aroud you, not to sink into a pig's existense, to (the infamous) 'think for yourself', to be human and humane, to see that people are a priori united, to reach out for others and so on. In fact, all of Tool's music does, but Aenima is the band at its best balance of focus and quality. The word 'teaches' may scare you away, but it is no brainwashing or hypocritical moralizing. Maynard shares with you his experience of searching for what is the core, the reason, and the aim of a thinking and soulful man. He seems to have found some of its characteristic traits which you are also about to discover if you are going to listen to Aenima. <br /> <br />What makes the album such an outstanfing landmark is that it is probably the first alternative album with such a deep and all-embracing concept. It came out in 1996, when alt rock/metal seemed stuck in pointless pitiful whining with no less pointless anger. Not that Tool lacks anger, but, as Maynard said, anger is nothing wthout compassion. Unlike other things bands that were around, Tool is not at all anti-social (don't get the title track wrong - 'read between the lines'!), simply because a human aware of his surroundings can't be one. Nor is Tool in any way pessimistic; music might seem depressing at first, but when you sink into it, you will probably be 'enlighted' and get energy needed to do positive things, to push things forward. <br /> <br />My review may mislead you so far as I have spoken only about Maynard, the singer. The truth is, the whole emotional and cerebral delivery is carried by all the four members of the band. All the instrumental sections are so precisely elaborated and expressive, all suit the lyrics in such a way that the music becomes really expressive and even if you do not get the lyrics, instruments will help you understand the meaning of the songs. Technically, it is absolute brilliance, especially the work of Danny, the drummer. The band is so powerful - eveything from headbanging to multi-sectional operatic is done amazingly (not that operatic means pretentious like, say, Queen; do not believe reviews that say there is too much pretence and self-indulgence). The production is muddy to further emphasize the darkness and deepness of the songs and the subjects they touch (one unexpected association comes with the books of Dostoyevsky, which are too dark for some people, but again - how can you deliver subliminal, creepy and controversial emotions in other way?). <br /> <br />The songs themselves (there are actually 9 of them, other tracks are interludes to catch breath) are rather long, multi-sectional progressive pieces, each one on a different subject. My favourites includes Stinkfist, Eulogy and 46&2, but every song, even enery minute is absolutely brilliant. With Third Eye, the album reaches a logical conclusion; this track might be the deepest of the deep, a tremendous cathartic experience.  <br /> <br />Chances are that you will have a rush of happiness when you will undergo the experience of listening to the whole album in case you understand it. And it is not animal or plant happiness; it is human happiness. Enjoy.  <br />

B0000025D0|5.0|In \\"Born to Run\\" Bruce's characters seem almost optimistic about the future. They're all going to get out on that highway, pull away to win, find a better life somewhere down the road. With \\"Darkness...\\" perhaps those same characters have found that the working-class life ain't so easy and that just making it to the end of your day is good enough. The songs however are fairly upbeat sounding despite their downtrodden lyrical content. Bruce is the master at this, disguising pessimistic lyrics with buoyant guitar and saxophone by Clarence Clemons. A song like \\"The Promised Land\\" though is one of Bruce's most uplifting. I get chills every time he says \\"Blow away the dreams that tear you apart. Blow away the lies that leave you nothing but lost and broken hearted.\\" Who doesn't yearn to do that? We all have our demons but \\"Darkness...\\" characters are full of them. It sounds great though and that's all that matters. If you don't own this album you should of course, along with numerous other Bruce albums.

B0009SOFFY|5.0|The Stooges in their driven naivete have seemed to recorded an album that rocks so hard, that no other album has yet to match it's awesome majesty, and even the great reviver of the garage rock sound Jack White quivers in its presence.  These guys knew how to tap into the most primal parts of the mind and expand it into throbing waves of noise and sonic fury.  They take the general \\"T. Rex\\" boogie and send it into the outer stratosphere on every track.  \\"Down on the Street\\" sucks you in with it's brooding groove, which completely knocks you against the wall when it kicks in halfway through.  Then \\"Loose\\" takes the same general idea but increases the energy and turns into a swirling molten river of sound that never dies down.  Afterwards the band kick it into even higher gear on \\"T.V. Eye\\", in which Iggy wretches the most agonizing sounds from his vocal cords that is humanly possible (it's kind of funny to hear him coughing afterward, but it doesn't matter because the song rocks that hard).  After the listener is pummeled with that amazing trilogy of songs, \\"Dirt\\" brings down the mood for a breather.  This song isn't at all boring though, it rocks on a slow blues groove with plenty of funky wah-wah guitar thrown in for that trippy sound.  Then \\"1970\\" kicks in to rev you up again into \\"Fun House\\", during which the whole band and a sax player play a proto-punk avant-garde jam while Iggy sings the words.  Finally, \\"L.A. Blues\\" roars in with 4 minutes of complete, chemically-induced noise, in which the guitars, drums, a saxophone, and Iggy's throat go all out in creating the most racket possible.  The bottom line is that this album gnaws up and spits out any other album recorded before or after it, and any musician with dreams of experiencing rock ecstacy should pay homage to this manna from the Gods of Rock.<br /><br />*just to add, Fun House owns any track on Raw Power, except for maybe Search and Destroy!
B00005JOHU|2.0|I guess this is supposed to be some inditement of the International Arms Market & Trade, when it can direct it's plot as it wanders around in it's own little world. Don't find fault with my opinion personally, I have no more agreement with the atrocities that occur on our dear Planet Earth than any other rational being, but this wandering fairy tale is a waste of time. From all the P-R Hype issued for this thing, I thought it was a comedy along the lines of \\"Deal of the Century\\", but, instead, it plays out as some kind of war story written by some Vestal Virgin from Vassar who, in her sheltered, RichBitch life, has never personally witnessed real violence, nor even seen, much less handled a real weapon! The writers evidently got all their technical information and most of their historical background from R. Lee Ermy on History Channel's \\"Mail Call\\" or from Soldier of Fortune Magazine!<br /><br />A die-hard Cage fan might want to see this not to miss something he appeared in, but, overall, \\"National Treasure\\" was a FAR GREATER entertainment value, as well as just as close to reality!<br /><br />Oh, by the way, INTERPOL is a STRICTLY intelligence-gathering entity, and does not have ANY ENFORCEMENT POWERS WHATSOEVER, much less fielding the SWAT Teams that appear in this fairy tale. If one does not believe me, go to their own website [...] and readit for yourself<br /><br />If you want to see a REAL War Story, go see \\"Great Raid\\", a far greater example of reality. Otherwise, save your money, 'cause \\"Lord of War\\" ain't even worth the price of a matinee ticket. I almost asked for my money back!<br /><br />The ONLY reason I even gave this TWO Stars is the \\"surprise\\" ending, which, with the ending text, contains MOST of the truth and entertainment of this two hour+ visit to FantasyLand!
B0009UC7H0|5.0|I must admit I had not heard of Sahara until one day Episode III was sold out at the theatre so I thought I'd go out on a limb and see something that the theatre clerk recomended.  What I got was waaay more then I anticipated.  I came out feeling like I'd seen a great adventure, something that we really haven't seen since National Treasure.<br /><br />Ok, so the pros and cons.<br /><br />The story is quite interesting, won't give away any spoilers but there are two parallel stories going on at once, one from the doctor played by Penelope Cruz and the treasure hunting one from Mathew McConaughey.  Both are fairly interesting and the producers get them intertwined pretty well.<br /><br />The acting was not great but good enough for their respected roles, which is nothing to shake a stick at mind you.  The only real outstanding acting I saw was on behalf Steve Zahn, who played the hilarious sidekick Al.  There's something about a sidekick that just fills in the comic humor gap and Zahn did a great job of filling it with his smart-aleck attitude and his funky \\"Hi, how are ya\\" voice.<br /><br />The villian is just an evil warlord bent on making money and saving his own hide; nothing special there but he has a cool helicopter so that's gotta amount to something.<br /><br />The action is pretty good, from the gun fights to the dramatic James Bondish boat scene, which ironically has music that sounds like something from a James Bond movie.  Sahara even has a climatic climax atop a giant tower where McConaughey is trying to save the girl from the evil villian and his henchemen.<br /><br />Basically, Sahara is a James Bond movie without all the suggestive remarks and sex scenes, making it a family movie, a rare thing these days.  All in all, I give Sahara a 95% since the acting was not entirely steller, but it was still a great movie.
B00006WUWQ|5.0|Please, give us a fourth and wacky one. Austin Powers is way more enjoyable than Bond or XXX. Humor is what's needed.
1400032717|1.0|Since I have been diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome, let me just say that Mark Haddon should spend some time interacting with individuals who have Asperger Syndrome. The character he has created is not an Aspie, it is a sick coagulation of characteristics that span the broad range of autism all thrown together and labeled by him as \\"Asperger\\" because he needs his character to be gifted enough to write a book. <br /> <br />Most people with Asperger Syndrome lead very normal lives and are able to learn to function and interact in society. I'll admit that I would much rather sit and read a book then go to a party, but I wouldn't sit and read this book. I couldn't finish it because the portrayal was so upsetting, and the foul language was overwhelming. It is this kind of trash that makes life for people with Asperger so difficult, and increases the misunderstanding that society has for us. If you really want to understand how a person with Asperger thinks and feels then talk to one of us, or look up information on the internet. Don't go to a fictional book written by an uneducated author.
B00079FUI6|5.0|Superb acting,writing and directing. This show will go as far as they want it to.  Probably the best thing out there right now.
B00025ETIW|5.0|Whats really sad about My Chemical Romance is they don't get a fair shot these days. Everyone is worrying about wether they're \\"Emo\\" or \\"punk\\" or \\"Pop punk\\" etc. People care more about what types of people are listening to MCR and how the band dresses than the music itself. I myself do not wear black eyeliner or nail polish and my hair is always clean and groomed. So now that we know I'm not some \\"emo\\" kid can we focus on the music?<br /><br />At first I couldn't stand My Chemical Romance. After I first saw them I thought they were just another typical band these days. Playing up depression and sorrow and whining about it with fast guitars and screams. But then I listened to their album a couple times and I realized. Looks can be so very decieving. This album is amazing. While it may not be everyones style if you like The Used or Thursday, you'll love this band and especially this album.<br /><br />My scores for each song:<br /><br />1. Helena - 10/10<br /><br />2. Give 'em Hell Kid - 9/10<br /><br />3. To The End - 10/10<br /><br />4. You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison - 8/10<br /><br />5. I'm Not Okay(I Promise) - 6/10<br /><br />6. The Ghost Of You - 10/10<br /><br />7. The Jetset Life Is Gonna Kill You - 10/10<br /><br />8. Interlude - 4/10<br /><br />9. Thank You For The Venom - 7/10<br /><br />10. Hang 'Em High - 7/10<br /><br />11. It's Not A Fashion Statment, It's A Deathwish - 6/10<br /><br />12. Cemetary Drive - 8/10<br /><br />13. I Never Told You What I Do For A Living - 5/10<br /><br />Overall this album gets a 8/10. As you can tell, it starts out amazing and then drops a little bit after the interlude. That's because while the songs are still good, they start sounding like so many of the ones before the interlude, yet ones previous to the interlude come out better. But all in all its a good album. If you can get your head past the labels and the general listening audience I highly reccomend you give this album a listen.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|The only concert that I purchased resently on a DVD. I think that the great quality of performances from the assembled group on the disc really proves this out. There is a lot of love for George on this. Everything is well produced. I would highly recommend this DVD!
B00004YYDI|5.0|I grew up with the short American version that cut out about 1/4 of the film at least and I still thought the movie was awesome.  It's a classic tale of an Assassin that doesn't have a care in the world, he just lives, kills, eats, sleeps and repeats process.  Until one day he finds something to care about and it turns his world upside down.<br /><br />The acting is superb, Natalie Portman is just creepy as a 12-year old girl that grew up waaay too fast in a broken-down home.  Her dramtic rantings, while over the top, are quite fascinating and downright funny to watch.  I swear, I still can't look at her the same in Star Wars with her awesome outfits after watching the International Version of Leon a few months ago.<br /><br />I also love all of Jean Reno's acting; he always plays a foreigner and a rather calm character, which makes him quite the action hero from Godzilla to Ronin to Mission Impossible.  He did a great job as the emotionally confused assassin.<br /><br />Gary Oldan is VERY creepy in Leon as the disgruntled DIA agent gone seriously wrong.  I watched Batman Begins a while ago and his character as the \\"good cop\\" just wasn't right because I know him as the detective from Leon.  See how much an impact this movie has on my future movie viewings?  This should be a hint as to how this movie stays with you.<br /><br />The story (as mentioned before) is quite an original and classic tale.  It gets really funny when Portman's character learns the art of being a \\"cleaner.\\"  I only wish they made more room for a sequel.<br /><br />I love the uncut international version since it's longer and more intriging.  Thanks to Amazon, I was able to find it since they really don't sell them in your mainstream movie stores unless you wanna fork over a large amount of coin.  Thanks amazon!<br /><br />All in all, a 97%

B000AVFLX0|4.0|'2046' was not the movie I expected.It was advertised to me as an extremely offbeat sci-fi tale with alot of visual effects and little dialog-this film is about anything but.'2046' is the story of Chow Mo-won.As played by Tony Leung Chiu Wai,Mr.Chow is a newspaper writer who leaves behind the love of his life to and ends up living in a hotel room labeled 2046.This number sets off the idea for Chow to begin writing a novel about a city of the future of emotional release.Suddenly the reality of his life becomes intermingled with the fantasy of his writing as he smoothly seduces and uses many diverse ladies-the affairs themselfs to become mere characters in his novel.<br /><br />  Come to find how Chow does find himself having actually falling in love with his ghost writer until he actually finds himself too emotionally distant to make any kind of commitment.Struggling to merge a happy ending in his prose with he's seemingly unhappy real life Chow ends up an disipated,<br /><br />broken man who continues longing for the love of his life,gambling his life and his money away-with no resolution to his real life drama or his written fantasy.<br /><br />  '2046' is not without it's adherants.It makes an obscure but significant personal statement and it's use of photography and visual effects is very compelling and unique.Yet on the other hand the movie has a few flaws.For one it seems to run too long and has alot of slow moments.The film is filled with false stops and tends to drive the point home almost endlessly.As the other reviewer of this film here pointed out,another problem is that most of the characters in this film are highly unlikable.Chow and most of the ladies with whom he keeps company are selfish and sometimes shallow people who end up insensative to everyone else and tend to exist for little else then carnal pleasures.It's only when they fall in love do they show any kind of vulnerabilty,which is sad considering that the few likable characters (including Chow's ghostwriter) are reduced insignificant plot devices.<br /><br />  '2046' works better visually then it does as a character piece-the acting is brilliant and the storyline is very involving.Yet at the same time one is drawn into the style of the film making-a surreal use of shadows,slow motion and distortion effects that are all tastefully done.The plot likens Chow's real life and his science fiction world-dropping in and out of both worlds until one cannot tell which is real or fantasy.So this romantic drama/avante-garde science fiction fusion really hits you either way.w's ghostwriter) are reduced insignificant plot devices. <br />          '2046' works better visually then it does as a character piece-the acting is brilliant and the storyline is very involving.Yet at the same time one is drawn into the style of the film making-a surreal use of shadows,slow motion and distortion effects that are all tastefully done.The plot likens Chow's real life and his science fiction world-dropping in and out of both worlds until one cannot tell which is real or fantasy.So this romantic drama/avante-garde science fiction fusion really hits you either way.
B0006SSOHC|4.0|This is not a film for the faint-hearted nor for Best Oscar for Acting critics. Filmed in a blueish tint, SAW opens with Dr. Larry Gordon (Elwes) and young Adam (Whannell) waking up in a smelly, dirty, grimly room. Each are handcuffed by the ankle to pipes, and when the lights turn on, a dead, bloody body separates the two. They each discover a tape, that when played, explains why there are there. Jigsaw, a crazed \\"killer\\", has confined them to this room for their individual failures to appreciate living. Jigsaw puts Dr. Gordon and Larry, like several others, in a situation that they must kill in order to survive. While bloody, the film is also a psychological thriller as it examines the human need to survive, and what ethical boundaries one will cross in order to do so. Reminiscent of Battle Royale, the movie is filled with twists and turns until the final scene. Danny Glover and Monica Potter have secondary roles. While gruesome and enjoyable, the movie as a whole is hampered by a few suspect editing moments and a sub-par director. While Elwes has a history of solid roles, Whannell is fairly amateurish in his acting and Wan's directing only exacerbates the situation. Ignore these details, don't think about the twists, and you'll have a grand, if bloody, ol' time.
B0006IF92U|5.0|Now, most people will compare this to her first and I have heard many like her first better. I think her first is rather boring compared to this one. \\"Mistaken Identity\\" is far better because she is more sure of herself and the lyrics are better overall.<br /><br />The songs aren't as commerically poppy as her debut either, now she has grown into a true artist. The singles are more challeng-<br /><br />ing musically than her others from \\"Innocent Eyes\\" and the other tracks on this album simply take your breath away.<br /><br />Several of the songs seem to be about Delta's recent battle with cancer and this makes the songs seem a little more realistic and vivid. She can become a bit imaginative with her lyrics and is starting to create lyrics that rank up there with Tori Amos,Alanis Morissette and Bjork, which is a true honour.<br /><br />She ropes in some awesome songwriters like Billymann, Cathy Dennis and Guy Chambers. These songwriters add more to the album on the whole. The album has a more stronger presence of strings than the first did which was basically piano based.<br /><br />Her voice is alot stronger than the little girl next door of her debut, her voice has always intrigued me because of the power she generates with it. The texture and her range are also superb.<br /><br />Overall, phenomenally better than her debut and ranks among some of the great albums by Australian artists. The best track on the album is without a doubt \\"Last Night On Earth.\\" This song shows off perfectly why Delta is such an amazing artist.
B00000DGUY|4.0|I've always liked the group since the first time I listened to them.There maybe a song to two that is missing from the CD but I would recommend this CD for someone who wants to get a \\"taste\\" of the group. The CD is clean to listen to.
B00008H2LB|1.0|Several months ago I saw them at Live8 and saw them perform, and I was sold that this band is not metal at all. The only instrument this band needs is a dj because one thing I noticed is that no one was playing an instrument during a song and how the hell you call yourself a rock band? Any hoo, the songs really got old fast and annoying which brings me to the vocalist, Chester can't sing and has a pathetic girlish growl and sceaming is his only skill(sidenote doctors recommended to chester not to scream or his stomach might kill him). But the reason I stopped liking them was the album with Jay-z, I hate Jay z's guts and anyone around him. I suggest anything from Tool, Slayer and Pantera instead for real metal.
B00097A5HW|4.0|The French verse that opens this album shows the kind of diversity that the listener enjoys with Shakira. Given that she is a Colombian who speaks several languages fluently and plays several instuments, the eclectic beauty of this album did not surprise me in the least.    Shakira swings from the more relaxed sounds of her and her guitar in 'En Tus Pupilas' to the upbeat studio sounds of 'La Tortura' and back again absolutely seemlessly. There appears to be almost no style of music that she cannot give an original reworking. Her switches in style also lead her to a slightly operatic sound in 'Obtener un Si', one which she carries well. Also two acoustic versions of earlier songs are used at the end of the album. I was impressed by the first version of 'La Pared' and blown away by the second.    I would urge all fans of Shakira to buy the Spanish version of this album. I have not yet heard the English version, but it is in her native language that she is most effective. My only regret here is that I dont speak Spanish, as if her lyrics are as graceful and as beautiful as her sound, then I'm sure I am missing out on another fantastic experience.

B00005JMJG|5.0|ETERNAL SUNSHINE is a touching and introspective look at the human heart. For anyone that's been through a mutually destructive relationship but whose soul still burns with hope, this movie will carve out your insides and then fill it with joy. Written by Charlie Kaufman (the snazzy BEING JOHN MALKOVICH and the disappointing ADAPTATION), ETERNAL SUNSHINE introduces us to two \\"opposites\\", quite and demure Joel (Carrey) and crazy Clementine (Winslet). Joel discovers that his ex Clementine has erased him from her memory. Still heartbroken over the relationship, Joel decides to have the procedure done to him as well to ease his broken heart. However, as he experiences his memories one last time, his heart prevails and he struggles to remember every detail about Clementine. The main story of Joel and Clementine, shown in an existential flashback/journey is mirrored by the relationship of two office workers (Dunst and Ruffalo) who also examine their lives through this procedure. <br /> <br />Most will find Gondry's directing good but not as brilliant as his videos. The acting, excluding Wood (though his character is the least developed), is top notch. The soundtrack is excellent.
B00005JNTX|5.0|A masterpiece of cinematic art! I can't wait for the sequel which is in pre-production I'm told.
0441003257|3.0|The book has its moments.  The one thing I didn't like was the random character intros.  It really broke up the flow of the book, but the plot is interesting and the characters likeable.

0316776963|5.0|As a fan of the author, I'm going to write a glowing review of his work regaurdless of content.  I followed his example, writing stories about my family and turned them into somewhat tall tales.  But David Sedaris absolutely, poisitively rocks.    While here we take another look at his ever evolving path in life as he teaches French classes and eventually moves to France with his boyfriend Hugh, the stories about his personal experiences and his family are the true gems.  We can all relate to his stories as a child, in his case being picked on and forced to undergo the humiliation of speech therapy in school.  That was a good point, if they singled out the future homosexuals through this process then what did they do for the future drunks or wife beaters?  And what's so hilarious is that when I look back on the kids I went to grade school with I see signs of that behavior in the adults they became.  But who knew then?    I roared with laugher about his family pets and how Lou and Sharon loved their Great Dane, Molina, more than their own children.  Now that my sister and I are out of the house, my parents did the same thing (only they have cats).  12 Moments In The Life of an Artist was wonderful as it preys on every pretentious artist I've ever encountered.  \\"It's all about my art! You just don't understand! I'm too creative to lead a 9 to 5 type life!\\"  Yeah, they're too creative to lead a mundane life and they're always broke, but they have plenty of money to buy drugs and are creative enough to make messes rather than a living all in the name of art.  His father made one story by shouting \\"Hey there, sport!\\" during one of his preformance art presentations, and the whole audience thought it was brilliant and revolutionary.  HA!    And how can we ignore the baby of the family, his brother Paul, a.k.a. The Rooster?  You could write a book about that nutcase!  His hillbilly, obnoxious, crass brother getting into fist fights and floor sanding for a living whose speech is a complex hybrid of rap music, New Yorkese and a South Carolina drawl.  You couldn't make that up!      A hilarious, yet serious look at life.  A must have for any writer for wonderful inspiration and a zest for life.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I couldn't believe my ears when I first heard this record. Initially when I saw the promo for this album \\"The Return of the Voice\\" I was like We'll see... but it is indeed the return of the voice, and return to form for Mariah Carey. This album is really good; I mean I was blown away by every track. I could bump to It's Like That and then get blown away by the vocals in We belong Together (It deserved to be #1 for 14 weeks, that for sure) then the rest of the album just took me on a nice journey that I don't mind reliving over and over again! Truly the best album of 2005, and one of the best albums of Mariah Carey's career! I cannot wait for the re-release of this album! Can it get any better?

0451169514|5.0|This book could easily be in King's top 5 ever, and is as well as mine. Overall, the book is great, and the characters and story have lots of life and juice in em. <br />Heres a very brief summary: <br />Something is terrorizing the small town of, Derry, Maine, killing off kids. A group of brave friends known as the \\"Losers\\" seek out this evil and try to kill it. Afterwards, they make a blood promise that if It ever comes back, then they would come back and face it again. And what happens? 27 years later, kids begin to be reported missing suddenly, and some are even found dead.  <br />   An unspeakable force is bringing the \\"Losers\\" back to Derry, Maine, so they can destroy It---once and for all. <br />This is an extremely long book, exactlly 1092 pages, but if your a short attentioned span person, there is no need to worry.  <br />Even though u have ADD or whatever this book will grip u and not let go. <br />Like quoted from the Los Angeles Times: \\"Scenes to be read only in bright-lit rooms!\\"

B00005K3O4|4.0|apalling as the title is, the film lives up to it! <br /> <br />This is trully a tacky B grade horror flick, which combines the theme of a typical B grade horror flick with tasteless acts perpetrated by aliens dressed as klowns. <br /> <br />The effects are cheap, the laughs low brow and the plot predictable all making a gloriously funny film which will appeal to anybody who  thinks \\"Plan 9 from outer space\\" is a classic. <br /> <br />enjoy!

B0007PAMR4|3.0|After waiting for Universal to finally release this extended version after pushing the release date back several times, I had hoped that they would have done a better job.  Unfortuanatly, this was not to be the case.  I am a fan of the movie, and I liked the idea of including both the theatrical and extended versions of the film on the same DVD.  I also thought the packaging was done very well.  I am disappointed, however, in the quality of the extended edition. The extended version was originally broadcast for television, and as such, certain scenes had to be deleted that, at the time, were too graphic to be shown on television.  Moreover, they changed the opening prologue to add more explanation to the backstory but maintained this same narrator throughout the rest of the film.  In the original film, Princess Irulan's voiceover is used and is completely deleted in the broadcast version.  It seems that Universal, in what appears to be a lazy effort, simply transferred this television broadcast to DVD.  In doing so, the quality is noticably different from the theatrical transfer in terms of sound and picture, and the movie loses some its original scenes that were actually included in the theatrical cut and added to the movie's richness.  It would have been better if they had extended the theatrical cut by including the deleted scenes within this version.  They, then, could have included the storyboard sequence that was in the original broadcast television version as an \\"alternate opening\\" sequence and included it in the extras or special features.  Given that it is a storyboard, it seems out of place in the film anyway.  By doing this, they could have retained the quality of the original film and extended it by simply reediting the deleted scenes back in.  I'm very disappointed with this transfer.  This could have been and should have done much better.
B000AL730O|5.0|Being a Beatles fan for many years I have followed the boys on their solo efforts.  Always enjoyed Ringo Starr very much.  His music was always fun to listen to. Paul has been hot and cold in his solo efforts in my opinion.  Chaos and Creation In The Backyard will rank very high on the list of his best recordings.  This is not \\"Beatle\\" Paul on this CD.  This is an artist who has matured. The CD is filled with many good songs with deep lyrics and moving melodys.  \\"This Never Happened Before\\" in my opinion may be one of the best songs he has written.  A wonderful song for those of us who have been lucky enought to meet, marry and have a lifetime of happiness with our spouse. Way to go Paul!! You did good.
B000A7Q2DM|4.0|I bought the CD and looked at all the reviews here written about the downloading problems. The deal is I have a Mac and use iTunes and an iPod. I had absolutely no problems importing the disc onto iTunes and then putting the songs on my iPod. I don't know anything about PCs and music, but if you use a Mac, you shouldn't have any problems. Thank goodness because I pretty much only use my iPod to listen to music:) If it didn't work, I would never listen to this, and I quite like it! :)
B000003N7K|4.0|Coltrane's sax and Hartman's vocals are perfect together.  The album is a reminder of how great the greats were and how soulful jazz can be.  However, it's also a reminder that CDs can hold a lot more music than LPs, which this CD was obviously taken from.  Its a shock to find the changer moving on to the next CD just when you are getting in the groove.

B0000029DD|4.0|This was a shot in the dark but I was intrigued after I heard a thumbnail sketch of the life and times of Mr. Buckley.  After hearing the cd once I went on a bender reading everything I could on him, he is still incredible. I have to admit; I can only listen to small parts at a time.  Generally I avoid live peformances of most people but again, I took a chance with a live cd and this man could do on stage exactly what he did in a studio...his voice is amazing, combined with his devotion to his muse and his mastery of craft -- I understand the devoted fans.   <br /> <br />By the way I thought, oh dear, another version of Hallelujah, just what we need.  You know what?  He turns that tune inside out and makes it his own.  Ok, three and a half.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|I first heard this album when it first came out back in March. To be honest, I didn't think much of it then. Perhaps my musical tastes were too limited and narrow. Perhaps it was Cedric belting out the Spanish in L'via L'viaquez. About a month ago, I returned to listen to this album after having listened to the Mars Volta's debut album, De-loused in the Comatorium. I thoroughly enjoy both albums. Frances the Mute is certainly not the type of album you understand on the first listen. Hell, for me it took about 6 months. <br /> <br />\\"Frances the Mute\\" is supposedly based off of a diary the bandmates found of ex-sound technician/producer/friend, Jeremy Ward, who died shortly after De-loused in the Comatorium was released. This album is haunting. Even more so because I cannot grasp one sentence of Bixler's lyrics. So mysterious... The band takes everything they achieved on De-loused in the Comatorium, the blend of rock, progressive, jazz, metal, and salsa, and improves it to the tenth power. This album does get a little out of hand during the spacey-prog moments (see Miranda that Ghost just isn't Holy anymore), but dear god, when these songs peak, THEY PEAK!!! <br /> <br />The album starts off with Cygnus...Vismund Cygnus, a mind blowing song with enough intensity from the whole band to dismantle your ears. Great vocal performance from Cedric, and an interesting scratch-jazz solo in the middle via Omar. The ending of this song (before the spaceness) is the mother of all endings. I am addicted to it! Still my favorite song off the album. \\"The Widow\\" is the only radio-friendly track on this album, as it can be edited to a fitting 3 minutes. I laughed when I heard about all the people who bought this album for The Widow alone, and returned it complaining it was \\"too weird\\". HA! People these days... L'Via L'Viaquez is the next track, and features two blistering guitar solos from guest star, John Frusciante, of Red Hot Chili Peppers fame. Cedric Bixler-Zavala channels the likes of Robert Plant, as he wails his way through this salsa-esque epic. The next track \\"Miranda\\" is as about as spacey as they come, and features Flea (RHCP bassist) on trumpet.  And, oh, they bring back that ending from Cygnus...Vismund Cygnus that I love so much! Next is the 30 minute epic, Cassandra Gemini. Filled with repeating themes, and a brutal guitar solo (that's a good thing), this 8-track sweet never fails to entertain. When I hear the part with Cedric whispering, chills shoot all across my body. The album ends with the familiar acoustic riff that launched it all in the beginning of Cygnus...Vismund Cygnus. <br /> <br />I highly reccomend this album to anyone who is looking for something fresh and exciting in the new world of rock music. I rate this album as the second best of the decade, losing by a narrow margin to Radioheads' Kid A.  The band is much more tight as an ensemble on this album. Omars guitar has improved greatly, as well as Cedrics vocals. The bass plays a much larger role in this album than it did in De-loused. Jon Theodore is much more musical with his drumming, but nothing on this album matches up to \\"Drunkenship of Lanterns\\" as far as drumming performances go. This album is definitely one of my favorites ever, and I only expect more good things to come out of this band. Apparently, they are releasing a live album in October..cant wait! Buy this while its cheap. I got it at Best Buy for 6.99. 77 minutes of pure excitement for 6.99...wow. <br />
B00003CXXP|4.0|A.I. is not about robots.  It is about the near universal cruelty and selfishness of humans.  Specifically, their complete and utter inability to truly love another being without getting something in return.  The humans in this film create the illusion of love for themselves, only to dispose of it when they no longer need it.  Sound like anybody you might know?   Sound like everybody you might know? <br /> <br />What better way to get this message across than through the narrative device of robots.  Specifically, a robot who is programmed to love and therefore in posession of the purest love there is -- he doesn't love in order to get something in return; he loves because he actually loves.   <br /> <br />In terms of robots having emotions -- aren't humans merely flesh machines which are programmed to react to stimulus?  We fool ourselves into thinking our behavior is somehow ultra-complex and more than animal.  We are kidding ourselves.  The only thing that sets us apart from other creatures is that WE SHOULD KNOW BETTER.  But we keep hurting each other anyway.  Over and over and over and over and over again. <br /> <br />In short, A.I. is a very dark movie.  And the first chapter is easily the darkest.  There are moments here that truly moved me to tears.  Although the rest of the film is indeed excellent, there are several uneven moments to beware of (basically the typical Spielbergisms -- you'll know 'em when you see 'em).  However uneven certain segments may be, the overall excellence of the film makes up for it. <br /> <br />That being said, I can only imagine what A.I. would have been if Kubrick made it.  Although he saw it as a fairy tale more suited to Speilbergs' taste, this ain't no E.T.  Not by a longshot.   In short, this should have been Kubricks movie, but Spielberg does an admirable job despite himself.  I was truly surprised that Spielberg could do it.  I almost wonder if he understood what Kubrick was trying to say? <br /> <br />Anyway, there is much more to say, but, you should decide for yourselves.  I highly reccomend this film.  It's worth every penny.
B00005JKG9|5.0|Probably in my all-time Top 10...the only other ensemble film I can think of in the same league is 12 Angry Men. There are lots of similarities:  a group of men caught in the same situation, whose starkly  distinct personalities expose a cross-section of humanity that is terrifying in its realism.  GGR of course has no Henry Fonda as a pillar of justice and reason, nor a Robert Webber/Jack Warden character to ease the tension.  It is not a feel-good movie, and if you're looking for some sort of plot-driven pay-off, you'll be disappointed.  The \\"plot\\" is inconsequential to the film - the thing could have taken place any day of the week in this office...which gives a viewer with any imagination even more reason to sweat bullets. True, people either love it or hate it.      Jack Lemmon:  Bold words to ascribe to a man of his stature and legend, but I think this could be his finest performance. The character is pathetic and reprehensible at the same time...and it appears Lemmon was able to tap into a part of his soul that recognized had his life not gone the way it did, he might very well find himself in this horrific situation. The desperation is, as another reviewer said, very difficult and painful to watch. You see him slipping a few notches in each succeeding scene...a man literally crumbling before your eyes...made worse by the all-too-obvious self-illusion and fantasy that he is operating under: The Machine is on the comeback trail. What makes this performance bearable and wondrous is Lemmon's mastery in making you want to believe in the legend: unfortunately, the dying embers of his former smalltime glory do little to shelter one from the relentless rain that pours down on this movie and on this sad character.     Al Pacino:  I have to believe that this is withtout a doubt his greatest role.  He was born to play Ricky Roma...it's pure poetry, astounding. His scenes in the restaurant selling the dupe are as good as anything I've ever seen in cinema. Interesting (for me at least) that for all of the huffing and puffing Pacino is known for, it's the sly,  whispered, understated dialogue here that leaps off the screen with a deftness of touch that is awe-inspiring. The scene with Lemmon at the office in front of the reluctant client is a delightful master class in portraying deceit (probably the only moment that offers some temporary relief)...and it's so convincing, you want him to prevail.  The relationship between he and Lemmon that reveals itself in the last part of the film is heart-wrenching; Lemmon sees what he once was, and what he mistakenly believes he can be again; Pacino demonstrates a half-hearted deference for Old School, and sees what he wants to believe he won't end up as.    Kevin Spacey:  Cold and ruthless as they come...as another reviewer pointed out, he only tolerates Pacino's character because he's currently the producer in the office. We all know that situation has to - and will - change. Spacey's skillfully-nuanced relationship with the others immediately establishes the graduated office hierarchy - from Blake and the boys downtown, to the office doormat (Arkin). Spacey's scenes with Lemmon are the most difficult of all to watch, it almost makes me wonder how they did it.    Ed Harris: Dripping with venom, and bringing new meaning to the word \\"bitter.\\"  The kind of guy you feel for on one level, but nontheless despise - until you see him confronted by the likes of Alec Baldwin.  This character is the ticking time bomb in the movie, and you cringe to see the influence he's having over Arkin. Their scenes together are fascinating, as you realize neither of them is going to make it.  The dialogue between them is brilliant, and the editing enhances the urgency of their predicament.    Alan Arkin: I was so glad to hear his commentary in the Special Features, because his description of the background he invented for his character matched precisely my ideas about the guy.  Mealy-mouthed, weak-kneed, and swimming amongst sharks, he'd be the first to die if this were an action flick. Part of what makes his character so compelling is that he reminds us  scruples and morality have no place in the seedy business of third-class sales....  It's tough to see someone doing a job that you can tell from a mile away they don't have a prayer at.    Alec Baldwin:  Every actor should be so lucky to get 10 minutes like that....an extraordinary opportunity for an extraordinary role amongst the top people in the profession.  He was perfectly cast, I can't imagine another actor in this part. This SOB could make ANYONE feel like a complete failure.  There is a strong underlying sexuality to the character, and a hypnotic appeal that makes you hate and fear him (of course), but there's more.... he brings out in the viewer a dark side that admires this kind of power and determination - an almost giddy, willing subservience. Part of you actually starts thinking his way: \\"Yeah, geez, you guys are losers.\\"        Jonathon Pryce:  It's a strange sensation rooting against a victim!  This guy was a tremendous launching pad for Pacino's character. A brow-beaten, hen-pecked, shadow of a man who has difficulty standing up for himself even when he's right.  Lulled and reeled in by the vituoso Roma over drinks, you end up resenting him for spoiling the dream and tarnishing Roma's golden touch.  A great and understated performance.    Again, the storyline is almost superfluous IMO. As for the language - it would be odd if the film were not steeped in crude invective, that's how this class of businessman talks;  it's absolutely essential to the film.    I really like another reviewer's remarks about the deadly atmosphere generated by characters we never actually see:  Mitch and Murray, Jerry Graff, Shelley's daughter in the hospital, Mrs. Lingk, the Nyborgs, etc.  They weigh gloomily over the characters, and create a genuine sense of un-ease within the viewer.  I've never seen this device used so effectively.    This film is far more disturbing than any conventional violence or horror, because this is the kind of horror that touches many more lives than guns and ghouls. It happens everywhere - grown men grovelling to eke out a meager existence under the thumb of inhuman bosses, and brown-nosed middle-management. As awful as it is to witness, the performances of this stellar cast are so far out of the ballpark, I find myself inexorably riveted to every single word, line, gesture, and facial expression.      This is a monument of horrible beauty, epic in its dissection of a brutal world, and the men that are consumed by it. I'll watch this film for a long time to come.  Thank you David Mamet, James Foley, and the aforementioned actors for making this masterpiece.
B00000F169|3.0|A classic.  I loved the talking bomb and the beach ball alien.  I also notice that George Lucas ripped off the hyperdrive effect he uses in Star Wars from this movie. <br /> <br />Very silly, but I liked it anyway. <br />
B000002OX7|5.0|Baba O'Reily is the first track on the disc.  It starts out with a three note ascending line played on the synthesizer.  Pretty cool.  In the very early 70's when the album came out, synthesizer music was still avant garde, not an everyday thing at all.    After a few bars, the piano kicks in.  Duuum,  DUM DUM.  We're all familiar with the ditty.  Pretty cool as well.  We now have the keyboard over the synthesizer.  Duuum, DUM DUM for a few bars.    Keith Moon then adds a thunderous drum intro, then picks up the beat.  Moonie is playing very reserved, but hitting the skins as hard as he can.  We now have the synth, piano, and drums for a few bars.    The Ox then comes in with that fat, awesome bass, just a heartbeat before Daltry starts \\"Out here in the fields\\".  He sings the first verse, accompanied by the synth, piano, bass and drum.      Just after \\"Yeah yeah yeah yeah...yeay\\"  BOOM...a stupendous power chord by you know who, and for several bars we are treated to the whole ensemble just pounding away..Duuuumm, DUM DUM.  Heaven.    I used the intro to show classes of mine how the different layers in rock and roll are laid down.  It never ceased to get their attention.    The song ends with a scintillating violin solo, and the album soars from there.  \\"My Wife\\", \\"We Won't Get Fooled Again\\", \\"Going Mobile\\", the disc contains some of the absolute best music, songs, and playing ever produced.  The Band (Moon, Daltry, Townshend, and Entwhistle) had been touring for years and years, and were at the peak of their powers.  With a rhythm section rivaling Cream's, and the greatest power chording guitarist of all time, the musicianship is fantastic.  Daltry added the rough-voiced vocals and great stage presence the band required to keep up with the frenetic drumming of Moonie and the windmilling style of Townshend.  And under it all, Entwhistle, the late great Ox, lays down, as usual, the greatest foundation ever heard in rock and roll.
B0000033OZ|5.0|This is the breakthrough album that helped launch the prog-rock genre. ELP's debut album combined the talents of keyboardist Keith Emerson, Bassist/vocalist Greg Lake, and drummer Carl Palmer. The first time I listened to this album, it was apparent that Keith Emerson had finally found band mates who were his equal (as opposed to the mediocre sidekicks in his former band, the Nice). The pieces on this album are big, bold, and rendered with incredible power. A \\"must have\\" for prog-rock fans and one of prog-rock's true cornerstone albums. <br /> <br />A personal note:  <br /> <br />I had the good fortune to see ELP one night at the Hollywood Bowl shortly after the release of this album. My friend and I arrived late, and while out in the parking lot, we could hear the band in midst of \\"take a pebble\\". Since we were behind the bowl, the sound of Greg Lake's voice and Keith's piano could be heard resonating magically off of the Hollywood hills. Absolutely incredible! <br />
B0009XNUK0|4.0|Truth is, Michael Jackson needed a 2-disc collection as much as anybody. Those single discs didn't quite do it for somebody who's still often called the \\"King Of Pop\\". So, the pros and cons. I personally don't need the Jackson 5 material myself, but some might. I also think this is a bit shy on his most recent work. I do miss \\"Earth Song\\" and the duet \\"Scream\\" with Janet too. However, many of his best songs came from \\"Thriller\\" and \\"Bad\\", and we get most of those here. In fact there are 7 of the 9 songs from the original \\"Thriller\\" album, and even more from \\"Bad\\". Plus we get the best of \\"Off The Wall\\", and again some of his earliest stuff. The fact is, after listening to this collection of Michael Jackson, you almost can't not like him. It's just \\"Human Nature\\".
0385006896|3.0|Not totally happy.  The paper cover of this hard-cover book was torn, due to poor packaging :-(
076790592X|1.0|Tuesdays with Morrie makes no attempt to be more than what it is: a dumbed-down bestseller for the dumbed-down American public: not only because of Mitch Albom's grade school writing style, but because of the content as well. The book consists of little but insipid propaganda to allow the Oprah Winfrey crowd to pat themselves on the back and feel holier than the rest of us. I felt, at innumerable points, offended by the almost patronizing tone of the book. While Morrie's philosophies are all good and nice, they fail to offer a single new or interesting perspective on anything. The few attempts Albom makes at subtlety made me groan with their blatancy <br /> <br />The irritating thing about the book is that it forces its theories down your throat in an unforgivably preachy manner. From what I can discern of Morrie's personality, this is not the way he would want his philosophies treated. Books should show the reader a situation, and allow them to come to their own decisions about what is said. Tuesdays with Morrie, however, being formulated specifically to appeal to the general public tells you how and what to think, thus making it one giant piece of hypocrisy. In fact, everything about this book and its status as-and clear goal to be-a bestseller makes it a giant hypocritical mess. It also begins to feel insincere at points, increasing said hypocrisy to a sickening point. <br /> <br />So, in the end you are left with nothing but a poorly written, hypocritical, completely banal piece of \\"literature\\" with very little redeeming quality. The book describes itself quite well with the phrase \\"he coughed, which turned into a long-drawn-out gargle, ending with another glob into a crushed tissue.\\" The book is 190 pages long. Though that is relatively short, it is overly long for this mess. It's horrifically repetitive, and could be summarized in a handful of sentences. In fact you can fully experience the book just by reading the chapter titles in the table of contents. It certainly is predictable enough to do so. In fact, I don't think I was even marginally shocked or surprised by a single sentence in this book. Not once did I feel the need to sit back and contemplate the profundity of any part of it. The entire book can easily be blown through in a single sitting, and forgotten within five minutes. <br />It's globby too-globby with sap, that is. <br /> <br />I feel slightly guilty bashing this book, for fear that it may be thought that I am bashing the man himself. Obviously, I never knew the guy, but he seems like a fairly nice person; and someone who deserves a tribute. Unfortunately Mitch Albom's book succeeds at being nothing but thoroughly craptastic, and as I'm writing a review of the book, not the man, I have no choice but to give it a fitting review.
B00004ZAV3|1.0|The Beatles shouldn't have a greatest hits because they never wrote any good songs.  They were an influental band, I'll give them that, but everybody calls them the greatest band of all time, and that is just wrong.  I'm a huge classic rock fan and listen to everything from blues to jazz, but the Beatles are by no means good music.  Their songs range from sappy trash with no musical value (I wanna hold your hand) to boring songs that make me want to shoot myself in the foot so i don't have to listen to the rest of the song (the second half of Hey Jude).  There are much better bands out there; don't waste your money on this trash.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Shaun (Simon Pegg) is a 29-year-old electronics store employee.  Shaun is an entirely likable and sympathetic character, who gets dumped by his girlfriend, Liz (Kate Ashfield) for various reasons; his bad habits, hanging out with his best friend and roommate, Ed (Nick Frost), who neither works nor pays any rent to speak of, and for never taking her anywhere except The Winchester, a local pub. <br /> <br />The story centers around Shaun, Ed, Liz, David (Dylan Moran), Dianne (Lucy Davis) and Shaun's mother, Barbara (Penelope Wilton), whose husband and Shaun's stepfather, Philip, is played impeccably by Bill Nighy.  Peter Serafinowicz is also quite good as Shaun and Ed's roommate, Pete.  And of course, there are the zombies. <br /> <br />After the zombies appear throughout the city, Shaun goes about his normal morning, not even noticing that his neighborhood is running, or more appropriately, walking with zombies.  A very appealing, albeit disheartening, comment on society contained in this film is that many people move listlessly through life, like zombies.  Shaun doesn't detect any difference at first. <br />Down and out after Liz's dumping, Shaun (and Ed) take charge; save Mum, save Liz, and go to The Winchester, a secure and familiar place.  David and Dianne decide to tag along. <br />From beginning to end, the movie consists of one hilarious scene after another, but the movie is not without its poignancy. <br /> <br />It contains some of the funniest scenes ever, including a side-splitting performance of \\"White Lines\\" by Shaun and Ed, with a little help from a neighborhood zombie.  Another scene, among many, which comes to mind is one in which the crew mimic an impaled zombie with the intention of blending into the crowd of zombies to make it across the street to The Winchester. <br /> <br />The film is absolute fun the entire way through.  I had to watch it several times just to hear the lines I'd missed from having laughed uproariously over them.  Brilliant writing and acting, with flawless timing.  It is a perfect blend of horror and comedy, with just the right amount of gore. <br /> <br />I discovered this film by accident and immediately purchased it and watched it numerous times.  It is my fave film at the moment and I don't think I'll ever tire of watching it.  It contains some of the funniest moments ever on film and is destined and guaranteed to be a cult classic.
B0002ON6ZK|5.0|Can you please tell me how the speical effects in  <br />Forrest Gump's movie got achieved.
0375830995|4.0|Wow- I had noo clue what to expect when I took this book home. Being a 14 year old avid reader, I hadn't expected such an intriguing story, to say the least.<br /><br />Ed Kennedy is your basic, 19-year-old, underage cab driver with friends who play cards and intense barefoot soccer games. At least... that's until the holdup at the bank. After Ed manages to stop the robber, he finds himself being given not-so-easy tasks on Ace cards by some unknown instructor. With each address or name he finds on the card, he must help who it pertains to. Abusive men, lonely women, young teens struggling, families and people of all types- he even must try to break the 'message' behind some of the people he cares about most. It turns out that Ed has a lot to learn in the end- and many have a lot to learn from this dynamic character.<br /><br />This book is absolutely brilliant in its pure wit and charm. Ed and his friends (stubborn Marv, laid back Ritchie, and the enticing Audrey) have so many wonderful quirks- even his aging dog, The Doorman, has a personality of his own! This book delves into the character's limits- showing the reason and antidotes behind being human. The writing itself has obvious and entrancing style- I didn't want to put the book down! Though it was a bit hard to follow at some points in the story- for the main character's mind set is constantly fluctuating- the end packs a particular punch that manages to tie everything together suddenly and beautifully!<br /><br />I loved this book, and the many messages behind its pages, and am truly honest when I believe this could become a future \\"need to read\\" of Language Arts classes across the world. :)
B00005NZBN|5.0|Being a recent Dylan fan, I was drooling to know his latest studio album. So I got my hands on Love and Theft, a double disc set.  <br /> <br />Overall this album is excellent. The musicians are wonderful, the sound is crisp, the instruments are varied. The different styles used by Bob make this record very appealing to fans of rock, ballads, rockabilly, blues, etc. The lyrics are very hilarious too, and some of them really make you think, as we have come to expect from Mr Dylan.  <br /> <br />Now, we all know that Bob has been singing and playing harmonica for 40 years now, so his voice sounds nothing like it used to in the sixties and seventies. If you have listened to \\"Time out of Mind\\", you can make yourself a good idea of how he sounds. A person that does not know him, though, may not be impressed. He has an excellent crooning, though, and this is why \\"Moonlight\\" is one of the best songs of the album.  <br /> <br />And there are many gems in here: \\"Mississippi\\", \\"Floater\\" and \\"High Water\\" are my favorites. The latter is dedicated to Charlie Patton, the Delta Blues singer and composer. The banjo sounds excellent in this one! <br /> <br />The final track is a beautiful and sad ballad, the longest running song of the package ( the same that he made in Time out of Mind and Blonde on Blonde )It closes the disc just the right way, leaving you with the desire of playing it again soon. And like all Dylan's records, you hear and discover more and more things with each playing. That's why it will steal your heart.  <br /> <br />About the two extra songs, the best one here is the alternate version of \\"The Times\\". Bob plays his guitar only, so the track is shorter, a bit darker, and very simple. The other one is a traditional song, very sad, and not that good.  <br /> <br />If you like Bob Dylan ( and who doesn't? ) , you can buy this record with the knowledge that you get a bang for your buck, and that you are in for hours of pure listening enjoyment.  <br /> <br />Now, if you are new to Dylan, I don't think you are gonna like or appreciate this disc. I would recommend getting an anthology first ( the Essential Bob Dylan is an excellent choice ), and when you get to like Bob's music, then don't hesitate to pick this Sugar Baby up.
B00005JNTX|4.0|While there is plenty to find unfulfilling in this movie, Robert Rodriguez, has a unique vision that recreates the edge and darkness conveyed in Frank Miller's original graphic novels. The director's sparse use of color, intense violence, and narration, doesn't so much develop characters but establishes them in very specific roles. Three-dimensional these characters are not, but because of the world they inhabit, this should be no surprise. The main characters in each vignette are anti-heroes, not called forth to protect the innocent or week, but to seek out redemption for the wrongs that have slighted them or the ones they care for.  <br />Out of all the vignettes, it was Mickey Rourke's turn that is truly a stand-out. His career has always seen him take roles as anti-hero ne'er-do-wells but in this role, he clearly relishes the power his character possesses. The brutality and hunger for a fight come across genuine, with no attempt to endear the character to the audience. He is there for one thing and one thing only, to seek out those stacked against him and brings them all down to the hell he inhabits in his own mind. <br />This movie, while gratuitous in its use of violence and sex, is breathtaking in its presentation of that violence and sex, giving each raw energy and focus that, in such a limited amount of time, captures so much of what was remarkable of Mr. Miller's work.
B000AJJNOK|1.0|Ok first of all let me say i've never liked 50 cent! Not even close but he pushed the buttons when he dissed my boy Fat Joe (Boricua 4 lyfe). He disses people that don't have much rep' anyway. Also he's doing the same thing he dissed Ja Rule for doing! He's singing his own hooks and is making 'Pop-Bubble-Gum-Rap' just like Ja did. This album is way over rated and only has a couple of good beats. I cant stand 50 and I can't wait til' his time is over. So please spend your money on something better . . .
B0007GAERG|5.0|How ecstatic and proud I am of Mariah. Now this is REAL Mariah right here. I like EVERY SINGLE song off of here. I'm glad that she maintained her voice over the past 15 years. I have been disappointed in her past two attempts of making music \\"Glitter\\" and \\"Charmbracelet.\\" Getting with Jermaine Dupri, The Neptunes and L.A. Reid proved to be advantageous for her.  This album has a balanced array of upbeat and slow songs. My favorite songs are \\"One and Only,\\" \\"Fly Like A Bird,\\" and \\"Stay The Night.\\" This album renewed my faith in you Mimi!!
B00008PW2D|5.0|im very satisfy to be a client of amazon.com
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I am a rookie on the A7X bandwagon, bat country being the first I have ever heard from them. They were always one of those bands that I figured I would get around to giving a try, not knowing that they would find me and kick my ass! This CD is so unbelievably good that I can't really put it in words, but obviously I'm gonna try. After I heard bat country on MTV2 I downloaded a bunch of stuff from there previous albums and I must say one thing, I love it when bands aren't afraid to change for the better. I know that I'm gonna piss off a bunch of you die hard fans because yes, I am new to A7X, but I am not new to music. There previous albums will blend in with any of the Screaming, obviously can't hear themselves, daddy didn't love me death metal that is all over headbanger's ball. Things like mushroomhead. Anyways, I am not hear to come down on other bands, If they can relate to someone or if that music inspires you to feel or do something then more power to ya, I just don't get it.<br /><br /> Back to City of Evil, the lyrics are average to poor, and M.Shadows is a sufficient enough singer to make the album listenable too. What amazes me is the musicianship of this whole thing. The solos are just freaking nuts, it's like taking the theme music from an old SNES game and fast forwarding it. But the one thing that I must say is incredible is the drumming. I have heard very few bands come close to that kind of insane yet melodic drumming, Slipknot is the first one that comes to mind. This album is a must have for any metal fans and I'm sorry for all of the fans that feel alienated by the changes the band made, but if you feel left out just go buy a mic and yell in your shed its about the same thing. Thank you for your time.
0446614459|2.0|Sean King, GQ secret service agent makes a mistake and spends his life regretting it when his right-wing candidate is assassinated by a seemingly harmless professor at a presidential rally. He teams up with ex-olympic athlete turned secret service agent Michelle Maxwell when HER presidential candidate is kidnapped many years later. Are these too incidents combined? Does anyone care?<br /><br />First off, I was very disappointed in Split Second. I thought the plot was really implausible. The villain and mystery were too far-fetched. And I just didn't care for either of the main characters. Sean King, was a self-satisfied, smug martyr and I hated the way he treated his ex-girlfriend Joan. Michelle was a cardboard cutout of a character, and I found the romance between Sean and Michelle tad icky. Not a big fan of May/December romances.<br /><br />As far as the villain/Mystery goes... Who cares? I think in this book I might've gotten more interesting if the villain had actually succeeded in his vile plot. At least then  I might not have to hear Sean whine about how his 'life was over' after the assassination.  2 stars for the first quarter of the book which was actually half decent.
B00006IU73|5.0|I have been a Prog Rock fan since my Uni days in the mid-70s in the UK. When this Brand mostly died in the 80s and 90s, I thought it would never re-surface. Furthermore having moved to Australia in mid-80s, I felt isolated. Recently I found the Amazon site which opened me to a whole range of excellent Prog Rock music and Bands from the 90s and today. I've bought a stack via Amazon.  Porcupine Tree's In Absentia is one and I just could not believe the quality and tightness of the band's music and lyrics. It is just one heck of a brilliant album. The opener is a solid rocker (must be played loud), then they seamlessly shift to slower ballads and acoustic rifs, then full-on again. Just simply breathtaking. For example, track 6 is something King Crimson would be proud of. Overall, I think they've been successful in creating their own signature sound (like Mostly Autumn). Great stuff!!
B0009F2C34|5.0|It probably wasn't something he considered over 10 years ago when he started to piece together his debut album, but after DJ Shadow released Endtroducing the game was changed for good. At the time a sample-based instrumental album was almost nonexistent, especially on a mainstream level, now it seems to be its own genre. There are many who try to capture the feel and emotion of Endtroducing, but most fall short, simply lacking <br />the soul. <br />The first disc is a remastered version of the seminal album, and contains the track list from the original UK release, which includes an ambient three-part transmission theme that launches one song to the next. Unless you spent many irie hours studying each layered instrument (which might be the majority of DJ Shadow fans), the revamped version may not seem different; however, the trained ear should appreciate the opened up sound. It was an incredible album out the gate, and this time around it's even better, if that's possible. <br />Disc number two is where things really get interesting with a collection of remixes, unreleased tracks and alternate takes. For each track off Endtroducing, the second disc offers an alternative such as Cut Chemist's remix of \\"The Number Song,\\" or the extended overhaul version of \\"Organ Donor.\\" Some of the more memorable alternates include the Gab mix of \\"Midnight in a Perfect World\\" and the unreleased \\"Red Bus Needs to Leave.\\" As a bonus there is also a 12-minute DJ set recorded live in Oxford. The little quirks in each song will have you listening even closer, while refreshing your interest in the originals. <br />Not that there was any question, but after withstanding the test of time, Endtroducing can officially be labeled a classic. Eventually someone would have come along and made an instrumental hip-hop album, but Shadow did it first, and raised the bar so high that we'll forever have our hands up. <br /> <br />- Corey Bloom <br />Synthesis.net
B000AJJNOK|1.0|sure he might have made a video for every song on the album, but he pulled an Usher all the way. He added a remix, and one new song, but got rid of the Hate it or love it remix. If thats not greedy, I dont know what is. This album is VERY bad (I kinda like the outta control remix cause Mobb Deep is in it) but the videos he made that werent the official ones are very low quality. I hate how he hates every rapper out there and I hope he will stop making music. This is bad. Dont buy it.
0975991477|5.0|Great book.  I heard Dr. Lipton speak at a conference and ordered his book.  It is easy to read and understand, even with the scientific terms.  Great book about how our beliefs impact our bodies, and our lives.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|As blockbusters go, Titanic is a good one. A certain amount of melodrama is expected for such a story, and it is done so well in this movie. Enough care was taken for accuracy of detail to satisfy those who want to learn more about the ship, its passengers, and its sinking. There is a fine love story which also touches on class issues.
B0006399FS|5.0|I never buy music because there are few artists these days that impresses me.  My lovely wife bought me this CD and I have been listening to it for months with great pleasure.  Perfect guitar layers through out the CD.  If I had to pick a favorite song it would be \\"Miracle Drug.\\"  The Piano and Guitar duo while Bono begins the lyrics \\"Of science and the human heart\\" phrase just proves they are awesome musicians.  \\"Crumbs from Your Table\\" reminds me of Alex Lifeson's guitar style.  \\"Vertigo\\" is cool.  The only complaint is that they tried to impress me by blaring the guitar level on \\"Vertigo\\" into my left ear drum! Ouch!!  \\"Love and Peace or Else\\" is my second favorite.  You can tell Brian Eno's production on this song.  Sounds like sirens but cool vocals!  Love it!  Really the entire CD is great.  Other than that? I'd sell my first born to see these guys in concert.  Wish I had kids!
B0007PALZ2|5.0|Time travel is a particularly difficult sci-fi concept to get right. This version is the best I've seen in many a year. Bruce Willis gives one of his most vulnerable performances; Brad Pitt is wonderfully crazy (I believe he received an Oscar nomination for this role); and Madeline Stowe has great chemistry with Bruce.
B00005JNTX|2.0|There is no denying this movie's technical and stylistic excellence, but Sin City is a pretentious film noir wannabe. It takes gratuitous violence to uninspired levels of depravity, and it pretends at a plot by interweaving multiple storylines and characters, all of which is too clever by half and amounts to a house of cards. This is a movie in which every male character is either a killer or a cop (sometimes both), and every female character is a Black Belt prostitute. Almost nothing makes sense, so you must watch the film as a pure sensory experience - albeit a very gruesome one. Some characters possess supernatural powers; we never discover why. I liked Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, but even though Sin City adopted elements of those two films, I absolutely hated it. If viewing two hours of violence and torture is your idea of entertainment, then by all means, see this movie. If it is not, stay away. At best, you will feel bored; at worst, you will feel disgusted. This film creates a new genre: The Sadomasochistic Fantasy.
0316172324|4.0|Excellent book that looks closely at how and why we make the snap decisions that we make... also helps one to re-evaluate why we make these decisions and how we can change our mindsets, if we so choose.  Really liked the eyeopening,  descriptions of why some people are so good at making snap decisions, in spite of the reality that we can't explain \\"the why\\" of our decisions very well.
0767830555|4.0|It's fascinating reading the divergent opinions of Taxi Driver, both here and among working critics; what's fascinating is that I tend to agree with most all of them!      When this film made its initial theater run in 1976, I was totally blown away (no pun intended!) by its unique cinematic style; a sort of introspective color noir dripping with modern operatic expressionism.  We experienced the salacious and gritty Big Apple street life from the cynical perspective of an alienated young cabbie--manifested through Paul Schrader's dark introspective first-person narrative, the sheen of Michael Chapman's surrealistic night cinematography, and Bernard Herrmann's alternately pensive and powerful scoring--brought together beautifully by director Martin Scorsese's obvious feel for the subject and milieu. It managed to strike a chord with many in the midst of the post-Watergate era...and unfortunately struck a wrong chord with a certain John Hinckley, but that's another story.    The \\"romantic\\" opening slo-mo shot of a yellow cab emerging from a cloud of billowing steam to the progressively rapid beating of a one-handed snare drum sets a dark underlying malevolent tone, and for the most part, that tone is maintained through to the end credits. We meet Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), a twenty-six year old ex-Marine who suffers acute insomnia and harbors an utter contempt for what he perceives to be the filth of his urban surroundings and all the depravity it engenders. He takes a job as an all-night hack in a bid to quell his anxiety. The tone is interrupted only by Bickle's inept attempts at social intercourse, especially with a beautiful \\"uptown\\" campaign worker named Betsy (Cybill Shepherd, whose presence reminds one of no less than Claudia Cardinale's idealized woman in Fellini's 8 1/2). However, the viewer always senses Travis's lingering malevolence just beneath the surface.  A chance meeting with Betsy's candidate gives him a brief but prominent locus for his frustrations, what can't be given by his colleague cabbies (including Wizard, memorably played by Peter Boyle), but it also eventually gives him a locus for a misdirected \\"sense of purpose\\". Later, another female/male pairing engages this \\"purpose\\" as Travis tries to befriend a pubescent prostitute named Iris (a young Jodie Foster) who works under the \\"aegis\\" of a slimy pimp named Sport (Harvey Keitel).  The narrative eventually boils to an explosively violent climax.    Though I found the personae of both Ms. Shepherd and Ms. Foster somewhat off-putting and incongruous, their respective characters serve the narrative well.  A Betsy who's a little less \\"ideally beautiful\\" and an Iris who's a little more mature would have suited the tone of the film much better, in my opinion.  Travis's abject social ineptitude belies his Marine training (A porno flick on a first date?  C'mon!), not to mention the absurdity of Betsy having anything to do with Travis in the first place. (I never knew Kris Kristofferson could so warp a beautiful woman's senses!)  One could point out a myriad of such incongruities in Taxi Driver; but I must admit that the possibility of the film's coda being Travis's dying fever dream never crossed my mind. It would certainly make more sense than a straight literal reading and puts an added interesting spin on it.  Any shortcomings aside, the film's sheer \\"cinematicism\\" is truly a wonder and a reason to have it in one's collection.  De Niro's portrayal of \\"God's lonely man\\" is one of the most memorable in late twentieth century American filmdom, only to be surpassed by him a few years later in Scorsese's masterpiece Raging Bull.
6302477751|5.0|This \\"Frankenstein monster\\" film by Tim Burton is a perfect model of compact and compelling storytelling; it brilliantly distills into thirty minutes what normally takes two hours. Frankenweenie is about love, acceptance, and redemption, and it's got a good moral. It's in black and white (which looks great!), it's funny, and, for younger children, even a little scary. Frankenweenie is my hero! (P.S. See if you can spot the clue that Frankenweenie has nine lives)

B00012L786|4.0|This review is for the 2004 Criterion DVD. <br />  <br />The story starts in a New York subway where a young woman named Candy gets her wallet stolen from her purse by a pickpocket named Skip McCoy (Richard Whitmark).  What Skip doesn't realize is that he \\"lifts\\" some valuable microfilm for a top secret formula.  Meanwhile, Candy was under surveillance by the FBI and Agent Zara (William Bouchey) witnesses the theft, but Skip gets away before Zara can catch him.  Zara goes to the local police to see if Skip can be identified and tracked down.  To speed things up, the local police Captain named Dan Tiger hires an informant named Moe Williams (Thelma Ritter) to identify the pickpocket.  Meanwhile, Candy realizes that her wallet is gone and has to find it for the sake of her former boyfriend Joey (Richard Kiley) who plans to sell the film to some communist sympathizers.  When Skip returns to his waterfront hangout, he finds the microfilm in the wallet.  This sets up the rest of the movie where the police, Candy and Joey all have their sights on getting the microfilm from Skip, but since he knows he has something valuable, it won't come cheap. <br /> <br />There are a lot of things to love about this film.  This is a great example of classic film noir artistry.  The use of light and shadows in this film works wonders.  The settings and backdrops are perfect for this movie and the characters are unique and animated.  You really need a \\"Street Hood to English Dictionary\\" to understand all of the jailbird euphemisms used in this film.  Thelma Ritter steals the show with her street-smart performance as fast buck artist/stool pigeon.  The movie does just about everything right except tell an original or interesting story.  There weren't any major surprises or twists - which is a shame because this movie could have been a classic for the ages.  To its credit, the film takes a strong anti-communism stand, which was obviously a relevant issue during this time in the height of the Cold War. <br /> <br />Twentieth Century Fox originally released this movie and it looks like Criterion picked Fox's pocket on this one.  A year after Criterion released this film Fox released their \\"Noir Series\\" of films.  With the current popularity of noir films I bet Fox would like to have this one back.  <br /> <br />The DVD transfer is stunning with very sharp images and the black and white tones appear to be balanced and virtually free of any imperfections. The sound is excellent for a film this old.  There are plenty of bonuses including lots of director Samuel Fuller material including some commentary and career highlights. <br /> <br /> <br />Movie: B+ <br />  <br />DVD Quality: A
B000A0GP4K|5.0|Great! Watching Dylan himself tell the story of his life up to '66 seems almost Bizarre after so many decades of silence.The footage is incredible, I have seen most \\"rockumentaries\\" for the past 25 years, I really think this is the best, it is better than \\"Beatles Anthology\\" too, for me anyway. I couldn't believe that half the stuff on this movie existed on film, & since it does, why was it it was never seen before? Was Dylan waiting till the last part of his career? It is the best music-related product to come out in many a year, (many a decade). This is my opinion anyway, I think if you like good music, you will agree.
B0007OCG4W|1.0|With such a great cast, how could this movie be so boring, unbelievable, and depressing?  Ugh!
0739302043|2.0|I'm glad I heard this book simply because it was such a popular book.  However, I didn't enjoy it very much.  The plot, while moderately amusing, was NOT believable at all.  Everything came too easy for them.  They never mulled anything over.  There were far too many \\"aha!\\" moments and that really annoyed me.  I like the character Langdon a lot but the others were pretty annoying.  By the last CD of this set, I was very tired of the whole plot, all the characters and was ready for it to be OVER.  Mildly entertaining but not anything I would EVER listen to a second time.
B0007OCG56|5.0|What a fun movie! Each actor is perfect in their role. This is a movie you can watch many times. The comedy is balanced with important messages about love, family, child rearing, and marital mistakes.
0316172324|5.0|Im not sure why I, as a 14 year old, chose to pick up a book such as Blink and read it for fun.  But nevertheless I did.  With my dictionary handy and my advil on the beside table I opened the book.   <br />  As I began Blink I thought I was in for 288 pages of sheer philosophical confusion.  But I am glad to say I was wrong.  Malcolm Gladwell is a very understandable and vivid author.  Blink is a book about the phenomenon of split second thinking, or \\"thin slicing\\" as he refers to it.  Thin slicing, is the art of taking apart a decision into sequential segments and deciding the most beneficial option for the situation.  The beauty?  This all occurs within about two seconds, almost a first instinct if you will.  All of this process occurs unconsciously, under your radar of noticing.  The problem with individuals today is that we have been taught that thinking a problem over, evaluating each part, and probing it dry.  Thin slicing is often correct but society doubts the reliability of the quality of a 2-second decision. <br />  Gladwell conveys this fact with the help of a series of very interesting examples.  Each example tells a different story that somehow relates to thin slicing.  This is probably my favorite part of the book.  Such stories such as: marriage, heart attack triage, speed dating, choking on the golf course, selling cars, military maneuvers, and that coke really IS better than pepsi.  These stories each push his point and give different examples on how thin slicing really is a very useful tool. <br />  So if you have a few empty summer days, or some snowed in winter nights pick up this book.  You will be amazed at how amazingly clear Gladwell tells about these \\"blink of an eye\\" decisions.  A very enjoyable story, I found my self laughing out loud at times, and sometimes I found my self sitting there thinking \\"wow\\".
B0008F1146|4.0|While not as balls out brutal as their Chaos A.D. album Roots was the album that caught the publics ear.<br /><br />It is a much more diverse album than many of their others, acoustic guitar tracks like Jasco contrast with the infamous brazillian drums and breakneck guitar riffs of Ratamahatta, all the way to tracks completely composted of native brazillian tribal music. The title isn't just a word, its a description. This is a band getting back to their roots, and being frank and honest about it.<br /><br />This 2005 re-issue (to celebrate the excellent label RoadRunner's 25th birthday) is the best version to own by far. Adding a second CD of demos and remixes, as well as adding the bonus tracks that were present in the original Digipack release, it is a much more complete look at the band and its, now faded, glory.<br /><br />If you like clever modern interpretations of Brazillian music, then you should own this album. If you like metal... well then you shoudl already own this album. If not buy it now. There is no excuse with such an excellent double CD on the market.<br /><br />Certainly one of the best Metal albums the 90's produced, and largely better than anything so far this decade. A must have for all fans of heavy guitars.
B00000342V|4.0|I love the music, but I wish I'd bought the original soundtrack instead of the anniversary edition, which is really for hardcore fans.  Why would I want to listen to two slightly different versions of \\"Freddie's Dead\\" and \\"Superfly\\" on the same CD?  Not worth the extra money.
0920668372|2.0|I know MOST people enjoy this book and find it endearing, but it freaks me out!  It starts out innocently enough with a mother rocking her sweet baby to sleep and singing a little song to him.  She continues rocking her child after he's gone to sleep through his boyhood and into his teenage years, then is shown driving down the street with a ladder strapped to the top of her car to do the same thing when he's grown and moved away, (apparently not far enough away though...). Then, one day she calls him up and tells him he'd \\"better come visit\\" because she's getting old and sick.  This part bugged me as well.  Perhaps she wouldn't have to tell him he'd better come visit her if she wasn't constantly invading his privacy by sneaking into his home nightly... <br /> <br />It doesn't help that this book was given to us by my mother in law.  She's been known to peek into her adult children's windows at night to see if her grandchildren are asleep yet. Fortunately, we now live in another state. <br /> <br />Borrow a copy from the library if you think you might like this book, or check out Goodwill, you might find mine.
0739404911|5.0|This book is wonderful.  It is far more sensitive and sweet than the movie version, but it still gives vivid insight into the effects we have on others- how we can all change for the better if we just have someone in our lives who expects it of us.

1400076943|5.0|39 other reviewers have hit the main points of plot, character, award-winning writing, etc., but I'd like to emphasize the possible allegory (intended by the author, or not)that the Nation is a Family, and that the family she writes about represents the struggles of her native Nigeria.  For me, this interpretation enhances her treatment of characters and plot.  This book also stimulated me to search the Internet for information and photos about Nigeria (foods, plants, maps, and political analyses), of which, like most Americans, I know so little.  Tagged by some as a \\"coming-of-age\\" story sadly misses the depth of this novel. I look forward to reading more from this young, insightful writer.

B000003N7K|4.0|an interesting album in the Coltrane discography. back in the early 60's, people kept waiting for John to unleash his furious free jazz sound into the world; but he baffled everyone by releasing a set of standard soft albums of exquisite ballads. this duet album with Johnny Hartman was one of them. and what a pair they make. i am not a fan of vocal jazz, but Johnny's velvet voice just drips and melts around these soft warm notes. an irresistable and soul soothing audio treat.
B000003CMC|5.0|Arguably the best studio work of the ABB career, with gems like Blue Sky, Stand Back, Ain't Wastin' Time No More, Les Brers and Melissa, plus the definitive versions of One Way Out and Trouble No More.  Mountain Jam twists and turns finding every nuance of the tune, much the way good jazz players turn a fairly simple standard inside out.<br /><br />Perhaps most interesting to me is that you can see the incredible growth of the band in just 6 months since the Fillmore record, and sense the search for a new voice in a post Duane era.<br /><br />essential music.  Played with pride power and passion.  Great songs, great performances
B000003N8R|5.0|i have been a fan of John Coltrane for a long time; first discovering his music in high school and then working my way through his back catalogue. it's always an amazing experience to hear a John Coltrane album for the first time; but even more so for the second and third times. his music transcends time and there are always new things to discover with each listen. his music signifies true beauty, power, compassion, and spirituality. when people ask me what Coltrane album they should buy first, i recommend Crescent. it is impossible for me to say that this is Coltrane's best album (in my opinion he has about 20 \\"best\\" albums), but it is a defining Coltrane record. one that clearly demonstrates his love for a melody, his unique dynamic control, and his band member's undeniable talent. Crescent is an album of stunningly beautiful contents and worthy of your time, exploration, and deepest respect. a record that makes life worth living.
B000002G87|5.0|This thing is so hot it still burns my hands when I put it in the CD player 35 years after I first heard it.  Incredible songs of passion and musicians that wring every ounce of pain  and joy out of them.<br /><br />Notable for the Clapton/Allman collaboration, perhaps the most overlooked feature of the record is the incredible drumming of Jim Gordon.  His capacity to drive a band while playing delicately nuanced drums makes this thing work.  Clapton and Bobby Whitlock trade vocals and while they invite you to enter their circle of hell, they make it so enticing you sign up for the journey.<br /><br />A take it to the desert island performance.  You can count the records better than this one on one hand and have fingers left over
B00004VXF2|3.0|This album is some sort of grand statement about society. It's trying to illustrate how painful it is living in the modern world. Or something like that. Hahahahaha- NOT!<br /><br />Aside from being one of, if not THE strangest records in rock music history, \\"Metal Machine Music\\" (which was designed as an \\"up yours!\\" to RCA records) is also one of the hardest to review. As everyone and their grandma knows, the album is an hour's worth of earsplitting feedback created by two intertwined guitars. The sheer sound of the album (imagine the static-y sound you get when you're watching TV, and you come across a \\"snow\\" channel) is an hour-long audio assault that NO death metal band could even come close to approaching.<br /><br />Is it fun to listen to? Eh, sort of. The feedback patterns are really clever sounding, and you'll find quite a few \\"Whoa. Now how did he get it to make THAT sound?\\" moments along the way, too. The avant-garde weirdness of the album makes this a great disc to spring on your friends/enemies/ex/whoever and the noise of the album must've had substantial influence on Sonic Youth and My Bloody Valentine.<br /><br />That sounds good enough, but the fact is: if you venture too far into the album, it WILL give you the headache of your life! Granted, I think that's the entire point of the album, but your eardrums will hate you to no end if you aren't careful with this thing. And since it's an HOUR of feedback, there are some moments where it just gets VERY monotonous, contrary to what some of the other reviewers are saying.<br /><br />That's why Metal Machine Music is such a tough one to review: Everyone is going to think something different about it. Some will see it as the most annoying thing ever, some (read: arty hipsters) will see it as a platform for their elitism, some will be impressed by Lou Reed's hilarious sense of humor...I dunno. Try it for youreslf, and see what happens.<br /><br />In the end, I give 3 stars as an amalgation of all the different opinions about it.<br /><br />One thing this makes me think about, though: Who would win in a \\"guitar effects\\" battle between Lou Reed and Kevin Shields? That'd be a fun fight to watch.akes me think about, though: Who would win in a \\"guitar effects\\" battle between Lou Reed and Kevin Shields? That'd be a fun fight to watch.
B0001WTVUW|4.0|I remember this movie on TV in the early 80's.  I vaguely remember my mom warning me of scary images and how I would have nightmares.  Sure enough, it worked.  It will go down as a time when I wished I listened to mom.  Over time, the images of the movie disappeared, but my view, and fear,  of a possible nuclear war stayed with me and haunted me for quite some time.  It makes a person wonder how someone would want to live through a full nuclear strike. <br /> <br />While the movie is a good portrayal of a nuclear exchange, I found a few flaws that are noticed only after several open-minded viewings of the show.  At first, the viewer is in too much shock and awe of the nuclear war scene to notice anything else. <br /> <br />1.  We see the effects of the Electro-magnetic pulse weapon bursting high in the air, and disrupting electrical services on the ground.  Cars, computers, lights, and other stuff become useless.  Then, all of a sudden towards the end of the movie, we see National Guard trucks driving around, transporting supplies and sick people around.  Were they in the garage when it happened? <br /> <br />2.  After the war, we see the disturbing images of \\"survivors\\" gradually succombing to radiation sickness.  This includes animals of all kinds.  For a time we see dead, decaying horses in the middle of pasture.  Then, we see Steve Guttenberg's charactor drive a wagon with two horses - in seemingly excellent health.  I did a research project in college on the effects of a nuclear war on humanity, so I do understand that radiation levels would decrease over time.  However, again it begs the question, \\"Where were those horses when the bombs hit?\\" <br /> <br />3.  As the end credits suggest, this movie, overall, presented, for lack of a better word, an \\"optimistic\\" view of a nuclear war.  Going back to my college research project, the aftermath of such a barbaric act could linger for as long as 10 years after the fact, and likely for many decades.  When you think of the sharp, perhaps total, decrease in the human population, one needs to consider the loss of those that are not even born yet because anyone that does survive would likely not be fit to bear children due to the rise in cancers and other sicknesses because of the radiation.  <br /> <br />This is still a strong movie despite some minor inconsistencies.  Of course, I don't think anyone is up to finding out what a real nuclear strike would be like!
B000063V8S|3.0|I love Star Trek TNG.  The CD's could have been higher quality.  The package for season 4 was not the same as the rest.  Mainly the labeling on the others I bought were applied with a sticky that peeled right off.  Season 4 was applied with a tape that did not come off so it now looks bad.  I feel a better job could have been done with the packaging and the quality of the CD's.  Other than that, I do watch them a lot and will complete the set.

B0009MAO46|5.0|Cowboy doll Woody is Andy's favorite toy, and as part of that comes the privilege of being the leader of all the other toys.  His world is suddenly turned upside down when Andy gets a Buzz Lightyear action figure for his birthday.  Suddenly, Woody finds himself in danger of being replaced as Andy and all the toys flock to Buzz.  Worse yet, Buzz doesn't know he's a toy.  He thinks he's the real Buzz Lightyear.  But when the two toys get lost a couple days before Andy moves, they'll have to work together to get home.  Can Woody work with Buzz when they don't have the same goal?<br /><br />I can't believe it's been ten years since this movie came out.  It's had an immeasurable impact on the animation field and movies in general.  At the same time, its flaws are evident.  The humans look as plastic as the toys, and the fur on the dog is laughable.  Computers have come a long way in ten years.<br /><br />Whether this movie was any good or not, it would have been an important milestone.  Fortunately, it succeeds on an entertainment level as well.  The story is masterfully told revealing plot points and character equally.  The movie is extremely funny as well; with lots of jokes for the adults in the audience and some classic lines I quote all the time.  Plus it introduces us to a Pixar staple, the climax that will not quit.<br /><br />Pixar has released great DVD's from the start, and this two-disc set is no different.  The movie is transferred directly from the digital files, so the picture is perfect.  Sound is wonderful in two separate 5.1 surround tracks.  Many of these extras are from the Ultimate Toy Box release of a few years ago, and they are well worth having.  The commentary is very informative.  The deleted scenes are interesting, but it's obvious why they were deleted.  The new features looking back at the movie from ten years later are wonderful as well.<br /><br />This is a ground breaking movie that is just as much fun to watch as it is historic.  I hadn't watched it in quite some time and was reminded just how fun it is.  I've got to watch it more often.hadn't watched it in quite some time and was reminded just how fun it is.

B00006879E|1.0|All the Maroon 5 fans will hate reading this, and will probably vote this review as \\"Not Helpful\\", but you know what?  The truth hurts!  Face it people, this band stinks.  Anybody who thinks this garbage is worth four or five stars must be braindead from huffing fumes.    I just don't understand it really.  How could anybody like this?  How?  I don't understand how anybody could walk into a record shop, pick up a Maroon 5 cd, and then hand over $24.99 of their hard earned money for this soulless two dimensional rubbish.  It simply boggles the mind.    What we have here folks, are twelve brain numbingly pointless tracks tailor made for adult contemporary radio stations.  You know the ones: those radio stations that play the same mundane Top 40 hits over and over all day long in an endlessly repeating loop.  After a few hours of listening to one of these stations, the songs by Coldplay, 3 Doors Down, Jason Mraz, John Mayer, Gavin Degraw, Ryan Cabrera, Kelly Clarkson, Rob Thomas, etc. start to run together and sound like carbon copies of each other, so dull and lifeless that they can't be distinguished from each other.  They just drone on and on and on, blending seamlessly into the background as a bunch of uncreative, unoriginal white noise.  That's the kind of music you'll find on Maroon 5's 2002 debut, \\"Songs About Jane\\".    \\"Songs About Jane\\" is (like all adult contemporary music) absolutely pure trash, completely shallow and meaningless.  Every song on this piece of cr@p is completely POINTLESS.  This is music about nothing!  Its a bunch of nonsensical gibberish.  They have nothing meaningful to say with this music, its just a bunch of inane chatter.  The songs sound exactly the same as all the other adult contempory bull$hit on the \\"Light FM\\" radio stations.  And if you've ever suffered the misfortune of accidentally turning on one of those g0d forsaken adult contemporary radio stations, you'll know what I mean.  All this Adult Contemporary cr@p sounds like the same annoying song being played over and over.  Adult Contemporary \\"musicians\\" (and I use the term loosely) lack the talent to express ANY original or creative musical ideas.  What you end up with is a bunch of inane chatter that means nothing!  Its nothing but gibberish!  I think I'll end my review of Maroon 5 here, because I can't find the words to describe how embarrasingly inane and largely pointless this band is.  Its the kind of thing that has to be heard to be believed.    PS: If you ever hear Maroon 5, or any other Adult Contemporary artists being played on the radio, for g0ds sake turn it off!  Listening to this idiotic gibberish will rot your mind and cause brain damage, just like sniffing glue!  Just the thought of Adult Contemporary music makes me feel stupid.  Just the thought of Maroon 5 crooning \\"She wiiiiiiiiiillllll be loooooovvved\\" makes my IQ drop about ten points.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|Madeleine Peyroux.  What to say?  She will be a name to be reckoned with. Her voice and timing of her words and music brings us a fresh clear view of life and takes us to an earlier time.  When you listen to her CD close your eyes, you will be taken back in time to a smoke filled blues / jazz bar. She is on stage with the band belting out her tunes as Billie Holiday or any of the earlier jazz / blues female talents would.  What a time you don't want it to end. <br /> <br />I thought when I first got the CD that one or two of the songs would be good.  Let me tell you the CD is absolutely delicious.  It is something to put on when you have an intimate gathering of friends for dinner or just want to relax with a good book and a glass of wine.  <br /> <br />And, amazingly you can listen to the whole CD and want more.  Madeline is a talent to be reckoned with in this day and age.  <br /> <br />This is, without question, my favorite record/CD this year.  It does not matter that it is a year old.  I heard Dance me to the end of love on our local jazz station and I was hooked. I give Careless love the highest recommendation.  You will love it!! <br />
B00009V8Z9|1.0|Ah...\\"Chariot\\" by Gavin DeGraw.  There is no better example of how popular music has reached an all time low in the last five years than Gavin DeGraw.  Just a few years ago, Gavin DeGraw would have been working a day job, because his lack of talent would have made it impossible to get a record deal.  But today, people have no problem with lack of talent.  Just write a bunch of pointless songs completely devoid of any original songwriting ideas, and you've got a platinum record on your hands!  Whatever happened to being an individual?  Whatever happened to coming up with your own sound?  Whatever happened to originality?  Gavin Degraw is typical of all that samey stuck in a rut gibberish that plays round the clock on the \\"Adult Contemporary\\" radio format, where all the songs have the exact same monotone sound, with pointless songs about nothing.  Every song sounds the same.  Listening to adult contemporary music is like listening to the same annoying song over and over again.  Every chord and every word of these predictable songs just rings hollow.  In fact, something tells me that Rob Thomas, Ryan Cabrera, Jason Mraz, Maroon 5, 3 Doors Down, and all the other generic, faceless, WORTHLESS adult contemporary artists could have acheived as much musicality if they were playing  their songs with whistles and aluminum pie plates as opposed to musical instruments.  At least it would sound different compared to the other 39 identical soundalike songs on the top 40 countdown!  In fact, I'm pretty sure that an industrial sized electric fan running at full speed is more fun to listen to than this pointless gibberish.  Gavin DeGraw is an absolutely CHEAP excuse for a musician.  Although this IS adult contemporary, a genre that is, by its very nature, inane and meaningless.  RRRHHHHHGGGGGHHHH!!!!   I HATE Adult Contemporary music!  Its the worst music EVER!!!
B000003TA4|5.0|..It is considered one of the greatest '90s albums for a good reason, even if it was hyped out of proportion. It didn't \\"start\\" alternative, it just brought it closer to the masses. For someone like me, that's just a great thing. Putting history aside, here's a few misconceptions from naysayers: <br /> <br />\\"Nirvana's music only appeals to suicidal and/or emo kids\\" --> I know plenty of people who listen to Nirvana who love their lives, myself included, and although I used to hate it, my liking of this album had nothing to do with that. \\"Nevermind\\" isn't even that gloomy. If I read this review, I'd think it were a review for a goth band or something. This isn't the Sisters of Mercy. There's humor on \\"Nevermind\\", which shows that Cobain did have some high points, whether you loved it or hated it. <br /> <br />\\"I blame them for inspiring (insert inferior band)\\" --> Nice shot, but every band who makes it in the mainstream is bound to influence some people who don't have a clue or talent with their music. You may not like it for this reason but it's not that valid to why these guys \\"aren't that good.\\" <br /> <br />\\"The guitar playing isn't very good\\"--> Well, it looks like you just need to open your mind: It's YOUR problem. Just because they aren't being complex doesn't mean anything. Listen to prog-rock bands for that; fans of it annoy me to begin with. Nirvana's inspired by PUNK, which is meant to be simple, and these songs have hooks and edge in them, which makes \\"Nevermind\\" so great. <br /> <br />\\"it's overproduced garbage, the other two albums are REAL Nirvana\\" --> Sure, Cobain may have claimed to be ashamed of the production. But if you like albums such as \\"Grace\\" by Jeff Buckley which were also mixed by Andy Wallace, you suffer from HYPOCRISY. This actually brings a diversity to the band's music, where the other albums would've sounded a bit more same-y if done otherwise. I like how it's got that crystal-clear shining through, although it's probably not what Cobain wanted the album to be. It was really well recorded and that's why \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" still sounds wonderful in the context of this album. <br /> <br />\\"it isn't metal!!!\\" --> Yeah, and what does it matter. Lots of Nirvana fans don't like metal anyway. <br /> <br />I won't argue that it's highly regarded, but some of the people on this site are just being ridiculous. I also don't like how some people ignorantly judge the audience and THEN whine about how others judge them. Look at yourselves. This was influenced by the loud/soft dynamics of the Pixies, although it's not quite as quirky and a bit more pop-based. \\"Nevermind\\" is an album that is worth owning, even if people have blown its praises out of proportion. Either way, I think an even better choice would be \\"MTV Unplugged in New York\\". \\"In Utero\\" is great as well and is on roughly the same level as the album. However, the songs here seem more developed and \\"complete\\" which is why I tend to enjoy it slightly more.
B0001GF2DS|5.0|I think the Italian artists who worked on this screenplay enriched the telling of an old West tale.  My first viewing of <br />it in the late 60's was entertaing, just as was \\"Once Upon A Time in The West\\".  But I really think this one has stood the test of time in a classic way.  It was really the logical next step for the career of Eastwood when you think about it.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|I just got this DVD today, having received the CD set last week.  I thought I knew what to expect, but it is so much more.  It's an historical  event the likes of which I haven't experienced in quite some time.  An emotional journey through the 60's, and even before.  Being of the generation from which he came, I can honestly say I have grown up, and grown old with Bobby Dylan, and have loved him forever.  Still, I was surprised at how wonderful this was, and it can only be Martin Scorsese's genius film making that makes Bob's story so accessible. The usual cliche's won't work - this is just something everyone that has ever loved him should own.  It's a very important piece, and it's an emotional wringer.  I can't wait to share this with everyone I know.  It's that good.
B000009EAD|5.0|iced earth's fifth cd is a masterpiece, and i think we all can agree. matt barlow blaring on vocals, jon busting out his insane guitar, and all the other members to give good feedback. this album starts with \\"burning times\\" which is an incredible song, and leads to \\"melancholy\\" which is a well-written very touching song. other songs like \\"my own savior\\" and \\"stand alone\\" are headbanging greats, and the something wicked trilogy to finish off the cd..nothing less then a buy
0553583182|4.0|Great book, but substantially repetitive in places. <br />The religious aspect of it is not for me. I liked the interpretation of 'faith'...faith in ourselves rather than 'faith' in some myth or fairy story.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|Whoever lessens the rating based on previews is an idiot. We are rating the movie, not the previews.
B00000DGUY|5.0|Sultans of Swing is one of those noteworthy pieces of Rock and Roll history that the listener can identify immediately upon hearing the first three notes, sort of what you have with the Stones \\"Satisfaction\\" or Hendrix \\"Purple Haze\\". The song is the insignia of Mark Knopfler who along with Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page, enters the stage as a gonzo guitarist and musical magician.Add songs like Tunnel of Love and So Far Away which also highlight the band's versatility and unique delivery and you have the trappings of a first class rock and roll dynasty with Knopfler as the signature element. Buy this CD for excellence and necessary inclusion to any collection that needs to be complete and reflective of solid rock and roll performance.<br />Jay R. Adler-Massapequa, NY
B000A0GP4K|5.0|This is a remarkable film in all aspects. Scorsese does a wonderful job of illuminating Bob Dylan's career through 1966. In the process he not only reveals a lot about Dylan as a person, but about the times in which Dylan was a part. The interviews (including with Dylan), the archival materials, the choice of music, the editing, and so on are outstanding. The film conveys a lot of passion and compassion for Dylan, for his colleagues, his fans, and even his detractors. It is hard to believe that it could be done so well, but given the director, perhaps it is not too surprising after all. Buy it, and treasure it.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|For those of you who have seen and liked Shaolin Soccer, please let  me recommend that you also see Kung Fu Hustle. It has some great comedy in the form of references to Looney Tunes and various pop references scattered throughout the entire movie. The martial arts and special effects for the movie are top notch as well. All in all I feel this would make a great addition to any martial arts-comedy movie collection.
B000065V3H|5.0|Definitely one of my favorites movies, as fun as tender and no one should miss it. Also one of the greatest speaches in movies history (Along with sense of a woman, death poets society and recently among 100 women)
1400032717|4.0|When I began to read 'The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time' by Mark Haddon I expected to experience what the life of an autistic child might be like.  Upon finishing the book (which I did enjoy) and reading some reviews, some of those with autism argue that the story of Christopher is not a completely accurate portrayal of life with autism.  For all its strengths, this may be a significant deficiency in the book.    The story's strengths:  - touching character portrayals, especially Christopher, his parents, and Mrs. Alexander, an older neighbor who befriends the main character.  - engaging writing style.  Mr. Haddon achieves a compelling voice for Christopher.  The inclusion of Christopher's diagrams, drawings and math work make this book inviting and interesting.  -  crispness of the story and its pacing  -  the overall upbeat plot progression    I would definitely recommend this book because of its uniqueness and appeal but would also caution those who want to read it to learn more about autism.  There may be better choices for those with that goal.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|Batman Begins a new generation of Batman movies and if this movie is anything to go on the movies to come will be worth watching and buying.  In this movie the as the title states shows the beginning of Batman from where Bruce Wayne was before to how he decided to use the bat and because \\"Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies share my dread\\" This movie shows the training that Bruce goes through to become batman.  I think that Christain Bale (Equilibrium, Reign of Fire, American Psycho) is the best Batman to date, I believe that he will be in the next movie which is at this point untitled.  But I eagerly await the release of the sequel
B0009PBNFW|3.0|Sin City is one of the most beautiful films I've seen in a long time and I think it is will be a hallmark in the history of film equal to the use sound and color. Micky Rourke,and Bruce Willis are two of the most underated actors in America. Micky Rourke could have been one of the great American actors and here he shows what he could been.Bruce Willis has grown as an actor and is maybe at a point where he no longer needs to be an action hero. Jessia Alba has the present and the beauty of Gene Tierney. But for a film to be great it must make you as the viewer believe that it's real. It doesn't matter if it's the Wizard of Oz or Raging Bull. I never felt that what I was seening was real mainly because the dialogue <br />was not real, the violence wasn't real.
B000A2IPP0|5.0|After JAWS and Raiders of the Lost Ark became Steven Speilberg's biggest hits, One film legendary film would become the peek of his successful career and one of the greatest american films of all time. \\"E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial\\" A film with a legendary title character,music,quotes and it's one of the greatest science fiction films of all time. Aside from Star Wars Episode IV, E.T. is my favorite SC-FI film and overall one of my favorites. E.T. is a Masterpiece, a wonderus gem to behold, the most beautiful friendship since \\"Casablanca\\" You could never forget this film and if you insanley did, you might as well forget what a movie is. I recommend this marvelous landmark masterpiece for anyone who loves the movies as much as I do, You should love it no matter your taste in cinema. \\"E.T. Phone Home\\" \\"I'll be right here\\"
B0007OCG4W|3.0|Sip a nicely chilled glass of a really good chardonnay as you watch this: with its beautiful locations, gorgeous looking people, and cutting edge fashions, this simply isn't a movie to watch with a crumpled bag of Doritos.  The look and feel of the film aren't the only things that are sharp, either; the dialogue can give a ginsu knife a run for its money.<br /><br />In the end, I enjoyed this very adult drama, though at times the exchanges do feel a little bit obviously \\"written\\", and overall the characters are extremely self-indulgent.  Also, for those who care about such things, not everything works out well for everyone in the end, though it does for some.  To the movie's credit, though, even if a character deserves his or her bad fate, you still feel kind of bad for that character, thanks to the actors doing a good job creating well-rounded characters out of the generally sorry specimens they're handed.<br /><br />  Finally, the DVD offers a sharp yet warm image that really makes those scenes in the opera house bar and at the chic gallery exhibition (yes, it's that kind of movie, remember?) really shine.
B0001WTUH6|5.0|The movie had a little bit of Romeo and Juliet, but with Vampires, Werewolves, and cool weaponry. This movie had a bit of everything for everyone. A must see!
B00005ASHM|5.0|WHY did no one make me listen to this album during my pop music college days? It is WONDERFUL! \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" is now one of my top five favorite songs, a ranking that is VERY hard to get with me. I love how it manages to be innocent and sexual at the same time. I love the song \\"Sloop John B,\\" too. This album is beautifully done both musically and lyrically. Definitely one to buy and listen to many, many times.
B000268QB2|5.0|Keane's music soothes the wild beast within, somehow communicating in almost a subliminal way, that you are not alone (with a groove). Great morning music as well as music to cook by!
B00005IC2H|5.0|This is less a review of _Ágætis Byrjun_ (OW-guy-tis bi-r-yun ['u' is like the \\"eu\\" in \\"deux\\". 'ow' should rhyme with the \\"ou\\" from \\"loud\\".]) than a handy guide for those of you who want to be especially snobbish (or \\"enlightened,\\" ahem) when describing your new favorite ambient wunderband.  I have for many years said 'See-gur Rohs' when name-dropping the band.  I was surprised to learn when visiting their official website I had been wrong.  Here is the scoop: \\"Sigur Rós; si-ur rose (the 'i' is like the i in \\"hit\\". \\"rose\\" is said very quickly).\\"  So, no \\"g\\" at all.  Amaze all your horn-rimmed-glasses-wearing friends with this knowledge.  There is a full pronunciation page ([...]) with the guide to all their most popular song titles and even a \\"general icelandic pronunciation guide\\" for those awkward times when you have job interviews with all the Jónsis, Birgissons, Kjartans, and Sveinssons of the world.  My two cents: The album is amazing... 'Svefn-g-englar' & 'Starálfur' worth the price of admission alone.  Guessing by the timing of my 'review,' most of you looking at this are also contemplating the purchase of _Takk..._ as well, and I could not more strongly recommend it without pulling the debit card out of your pocket for you.  It is more traditionally structured (translation: it's got more straight-up songs, man!) but still has all the atmospherics and ethereal soundscapes that made you love them to begin with... so just save yourself the trouble and get 'em all (Von, Ágætis Byrjun, ( ), & Takk...).  +=!?
0375704027|4.0|This is an incredible novel, marking a departure for Haruki Murakami away from his more \\"magically real\\" settings and characters. In this book, Murakami writes a very vivid, realistic love memoir of Toru Watanabe, which you can read all about it the editorial reviews.  <br /> <br />It is interesting to note that before writing this book, Murakami bought and read the collected works of Natsume Soseki, which was a huge influence on the style of the book (Soseki is one of the only Japanese novelists that Murakami has read). <br /> <br />I would definitely give this novel 5 stars, but the translation is a bit sub-par and unnatural at times. If you can, I would DEFINTELY suggest reading Murakami in the original Japanese!
B000AL730O|3.0|As a songwriter, I can appreciate this album. I can also conduct an honest review. Musically, this is a more mellow album than his most recent offerings. Lyrically, well, let's face it, Paul is no Lennon when it comes to lyrics. He's more of a melody writer. The album has a 70's feel, if they told me that \\"Fine Line\\", \\"At the Mercy\\", \\"Too Much Rain\\", and \\"This Never Happened Before\\" were Wings hits, I would believe it since I don't own a single Wings album. Concerning the latter ballad, while it's musically beautiful the lyrics are so Pre-K, rhyming \\"sure\\" with \\"sure\\", \\"be\\" with \\"see\\". He basically wasted a great melody. Now for the good stuff: \\"Friends To Go\\" has Rubber Soul written all over it and is a fitting tribute to George as a composer. \\"Promise To You Girl\\" has the drive of \\"Lady Madonna\\" when it kicks into gear, and \\"English Tea\\" is a lost track from the White Album or Abbey Road. \\"Jenny Wren\\" is a classic with a mysterious instrumental part. \\"How Kind of You\\" is a great track with some interesting sounds. \\"Riding To Vanity Fair\\" is a dark and moody track with very good lyrics. Paul has really opened up. Again, he's almost 64 now, this is not the Paul from 1964. I enjoyed this album more than \\"Flaming Pie\\" and I have been listening to it everyday for the past week. Compared to \\"Driving Rain\\", this is a GREAT album. Nigel did an excellent job producing it and people should stop expecting Paul to record an album that's filled completely with \\"future\\" greatest hits. That is not a realistic expectation. It was really refreshing to see Paul trying something different and experiment.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|Ok, so if you've read his book (Chronicles) you probably won't get any new information here.  But should that deter you from viewing this film?  Absolutely not.  The sheer joy of this film lies in seeing and hearing the actual people, performances, critics, etc. in their space and time.  So, while you won't get any new information you are bound to get a perspective on Bob in some way that just isn't possible without watching this film.  The bonus material of Bob's performances is just icing on the cake.  A must have for any Dylan fan and a must watch for any casual listener wanting to gain some perspective on this artist.
B00079FUI6|2.0|Gee, I wish that I could sell my Desperate Housewives boxed set to one of you people who actually liked it. I didn't really enjoy it.

B00000JG41|5.0|I found this album in my friend's case and had never heard of these guys before. Very glad I ended up grabbing the California album. My friend was very into music and got high to this stuff. It's clear why, Mr. Bungle is so eclectic. They blend so many styles and borrow from so many genres. It's more than you can even break apart and analyze.  <br /> <br />The lyrics are hard to decipher and even when you get them online, they rarely have a clear message or story. But perhaps that's partly the point. Mr. Bungle makes noise-rock. The songs aren't written for their lyrics; those are secondary to the music.  <br /> <br />I still have no idea what most of their songs mean, even after looking up and learning the lyrics. Even still, \\"Sweet Charity\\" and \\"Retrovertigo\\" are my favorite songs. The overly sexual songs like \\"Girls of Porn\\" (off the Mr. Bungle album) aren't that hard to figure out. \\"Vanity Fair\\" is fairly clear. Side note, \\"Girls of Porn\\" is such a dirty song, but it has such a pop-y melody, I love singing along with it.  <br /> <br />Mr. Bungle is often compared to Faith No More. Although I like some Faith No More, I think that Mr. Bungle is much better. Since trying out that CD I'd never heard of from my friend's case, I've heard Mr. Bungle's Mr. Bungle and some of Disco Volante. I like California better, but Mr. Bungle  has a ton of great tracks. I've only heard some of Disco Volante and I didn't really like it as well, but it's truer to Mr. Bungle's noise-rock.  <br /> <br />Mr. Bungle is an acquired taste, but if you like a lot of different kinds of music and are willing to take a risk, I doubt you'll be disappointed with the California album. I think its Mr. Bungle at their best.  <br />

0800177177|1.0|This movie is cofusing as hell! <br />I had to watch the first 15 minutes about 5 times to actually understand what was going on. I was looking for more of a thrill and I didn't get it with this film. The acting is alright, though I wish they would've picked someone else besides Winona Ryder.  <br />Save your money and get Queen of The Damned, or the Vampire Cronicles.

B0002Z0EYK|4.0|I like this movie a lot. In fact, I come close to loving it. The battle scenes between the Greeks and the Trojans were super-everything from the throwing of spears to the swinging of swords to the firing of arrows to the catapulting of fireball rocks. Oh and there was plenty of blood, too(Niiiiccccceee!)Blood flying everywhere-in pints! Wicked. Achilles, by the way, was my favorite character. Brad Pitt did him superbly and Hector was in close second place, as Eric Bana played him like a dream and he showed that just as Achilles was the Greek of all Greeks, Hector was the Trojan of all  Trojans. All of this is true as far as I'm concerned. On top of that, Helen was wicked sexy and more beautiful than any woman I've seen in any movie, and King Priam was  very brave for someone who did little fighting. However, despite that, and the fact that the Trojan Horse was built very well, I did not like Paris very much. He was a coward and a wimp. But other than that, this movie rocks!

B000BB14YY|5.0|Now that Amazon is offering the Criterion DVD of Kurosawa's RAN with a ton of supplementary material order it now!  In this two disc masterpiece will be AK the 74 minute film by Chris Marker which in itself is worth buying.  Set to classical music this tribute on the filming of Ran long ago distinguished itself for being a superb film.  Add a recent interview with RAN star Japanese actor<br />Tatsuya Nakadai, and you have it.  Both my Japanese version of RAN and AK on laser discs have seen better days, and I can hardly wait for this great work to finally get a decent DVD transfer, and with Criterion you know it will.  Just push the order button, and pray that November's release date comes real soon ... and NOW IT IS HERE, and it is simply amazing.  One of the best DVD's I have ever owned, and the supplemental disc on the making of Ran will blow you away.  Mieko Harada the actress who plays Lady Kaede in her interview tells how Kurosawa's blunt comments as the film was being made got the actors and the production crew to form a very cohesive unit, and get the filming done right, and many times on the first take.  Chris Marker's 74 minute visual treat \\"AK\\" is also included the first time this film has been available outside of Japan, and actor Tatsuya Nakadai's interview is wonderful.  if you purchase no other DVD this year purchase this set.  You will wear out your DVD player watching it time and time again!

B0007DHJT0|5.0|I first read the book & loved it so when the movie came out I had to watch it. It is the only movie that followed the book totally. If you have read the book you will love the movie. The charters are so real. And the white trash girl who said the black man had raped her really wants you to slap her down. Her father is a red neck idiot. You will like the black man from the beginning. He really is a good man & would never touch a white woman. He would not rape any woman. And Gregory Peck is wonderful as his lawyer. And the children. So interesting. And the slightly slow man who is their friend. A+ movie from beginning to end. Top of the line movie.
B00005JMXX|5.0|I have to admit I am a huge fan of disaster movies.  My favorite was the Posideon Adventure; however, the movie has been surpassed by TDAT.  The special effects are incredible.

0451196716|3.0|\\"The Long Walk\\" was a decent read when you consider that the only thing happening in the novel is the Long Walk.  King does a good job in describing the physical and psychological effects the Walk has on the boys.  It's not every author that can take something as mundane as walking and turn it into a horror novel.   <br /> <br />I wish King had gone into more detail as to why the boys signed up to do the walk in the first place.  They weren't forced nor was there some law forcing the boys to participate.  More information about the government that created the Walk would have added to the horror of the novel.  I also agree with the other reviewers about how aburpt the novel seemed to end.  The story didn't feel finished. <br /> <br />Overall, \\"The Long Walk\\" was a enjoyable read, but one that won't stand out as a personal favorite.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|The opening scene is so beautiful it makes you long to jump into the screen for a visit...we see a Victorian neighborhood, with some of the most exquisite Victorian houses ever to grace a movie screen, at night with snow falling and Christmas carols being sung softly; this is simply fantastic and a great introduction to the high level of quality throughout the feature.<br /><br />Lady is a Christmas gift for Mrs. Darling from her husband Jim. At first, Lady is the apple of their eyes and the only one with the special attention accorded a new member of the family...and all is well until one day Lady finds out that soon there will be a new tiny Darling arriving soon to the household.<br /><br />Not knowing what a baby is, Lady at first isn't too concerned until her new friend the Tramp paints a dark, dire picture of life shared with a human baby...\\"Baby moves in-dog moves out.\\"<br /><br />Lady's neighbor dog pals, Jock and Trusty hasten to reassure her but she is too panicky to calm down.<br /><br />Jock is a sturdy little square bodied Scotsman, (Scottish terrier) a true gentleman and a wee bit thrifty with his bones, which he carefully buries in his own secret spot, singing \\"Bonnie Banks of Loch Loman\\" in a thick Scottish accent as he hides his cache.<br /><br />Trusty is an elderly retired Bloodhound who has vivid dreams of the good old days, chasing convicts for miles; so vivid his legs move and he howls throughout his dream. He wakes up and finds a striped caterpillar on his nose and it takes him a minute to realize this is not a real convict wearing stripes.<br /><br />When he visits Lady, he calls her \\"Miss La-dy...Miss La-dy Ma'am...\\" with touching respect.<br /><br />Both Jock and Trusty disapprove of Tramp and dislike him on the spot. This bothers Tramp not at all, and Lady is captivated with this rough and tumble vagabond, with an exciting life so different from her own.<br /><br />After the baby is born, the Darlings have to go out of town so they ask Aunt Sarah to come and baby sit. This is very bad news for Lady as Aunt Sarah detests dogs and bings her own very naughty kitties, Si and Am, 2 Siamese cats with the devil in them.<br /><br />Their first act upon entering the Darling house is to get Lady into serious trouble, and thus earns her a huge demerit in Aunt Sarah's eyes. Their next act is more serious as they make a mess in the baby's room and when Lady goes in to see what all the noise is, she gets caught by Aunt Sarah and blamed for the whole mess. She takes Lady to the pet store and makes her wear a muzzle.<br /><br />Of course, this is dreadful, and Lady runs away and finds Tramp who rescues her after she is chased and threatened by a pack of mad dogs, and he takes her to the zoo to have an obliging animal remove it for her.<br /><br />Once at the zoo they visit several animals willing to do the job but they are a bit too eager and far too ferocious to trust with such a delicate task.<br /><br />Eventually they wind up at the home of a busy beaver (is there any other kind?) and he bites off the straps in one quick snap.<br /><br />It is getting dark now so Lady and Tramp head to Tony's Italian restaurant, where Tramp is known as Butch and is a favorite with the owner and his cook.<br /><br />They are served a huge spaghetti dinner with lots of extra \\"meats-a-balls\\", much to their delight. This scene is one of the highlights of the movie and the two dogs fall in love sharing a strand of pasta with \\"Bella Notte\\" being sung to them.<br /><br />When they finally arrive back at Lady's house, they find a huge rat trying to get into the baby's crib. Tramp finds it and kills it, but Aunt Sarah comes in and again leaps to the wrong conclusion and screams and Tramp is picked up by the dog catcher.<br /><br />Jock and Trusty rush to Tramp's rescue and Trusty is hit by a car on the way. It says much for the character of the two dogs, especially Trusty, that they would risk life and limb to save a dog they didn't really like at first. Eventually the Darlings come home in the nick of time to save Tramp and Aunt Sarah is sent packing, cats included.<br /><br />Then we are at Christmas again and this time Lady and Tramp are surrounded by tiny puppies, half Ladies and half Tramps.<br /><br />Jock and Trusty, healed from his injuries but still wearing a cast, come in and join the festivities.<br /><br />We pull back from the Dalring house, now happily filled with dogs, puppies and people and leave them to enjoy their best Christmas ever.<br /><br />Fabulous animation, from the Golden Era at Disney, and a real treat for everyone and anyone of any age. GREAT story and beautiful to see, funny and sad and exciting, has it all.Tramp and Aunt Sarah is sent packing, cats included. <br />Then we are at Christmas again and this time Lady and Tramp are surrounded by tiny puppies, half Ladies and half Tramps. <br />Jock and Trusty, healed from his injuries but still wearing a cast, come in and join the festivities. <br />We pull back from the Dalring house, now happily filled with dogs, puppies and people and leave them to enjoy their best Christmas ever. <br />Fabulous animation, from the Golden Era at Disney, and a real treat for everyone and anyone of any age.

B000641ZA4|5.0|The 5.1 DTS sound of this video collection is worth the price alone. Even though I have small speakers, the songs still come across as crisp and vibrant, a definite upgrade to the normal stereo format previously available for these videos.<br /><br />The video quality is, as expected, outstanding. More notable goodies are the \\"Calling All Stations\\" videos which feature Ray Wilson in the last era of Genesis. It's too bad that the band did not continue after this because he was vastly underrated as a lead singer. Then there's \\"Carpet Crawlers\\", the late 90's version, which is simply amazing. An awesome Peter Gabriel / Rael \\"clone\\" is in the video and if every LAMB song was produced like this on video the band could easily make a movie of that brilliant album. Of course, the \\"fluffier\\" Phil-era songs like \\"Invisible Touch\\" and \\"Throwing it all Away\\" are here too, and they sound great. \\"Illegal Alien\\" is a hilarious video showing that Genesis indeed had quite a sense of humor.<br /><br />I'm glad this is finally available. After years of trying to collect each promo on video, Rhino has now made it possible to buy them all on one collection. Now if only we could get some great \\"live\\" archive material as well....:-)
B000AA4LAK|5.0|Whether you're a Killers fan like me or just a fan of music, this album is the 'cherry on top' of your music collection. The international No.1 selling album that introduced us to a new super-band destined for the timeless leagues of U2, Depeche Mode and The Cure. A band that will exist years after their contemporaries have been labelled one-album-wonders. This limited 'Hot Fuss' is the true marriage of song writing, performance and production that has been lacking in modern music for way too long - with extra tracks!
0201485672|5.0|This book presented a very methodical approach to refactoring that I found very useful.  In practice, it can be tricky to follow.

B000A6T1HC|5.0|These terrific arias from Roman oratorios are bravura pieces of the highest order and nothing more than thinly disguised opera showpieces, an art form banned by the Vatican and forbidden to be performed in Rome.  I agree with almost everyone when I state that I think that, musically and scholastically, it is Cecilia's best effort (and that's saying quite a bit).  The coloratura pieces are delivered with Cecilia's customary flair, panache and spot on intonation and breath control but the laments are equally impressive not only for the same reasons but for her ability to conjure a genuine sense of pathos, without resorting to melodrama or self-indulgence.  This is a banner year for Mr. Minkowski; first with his fantastic \\"Une Symphonie Imaginaire\\" and now with \\"Opera Proibita\\" he's finally showing us that he can tackle works of emotional depth and intensity with the same commitment he does the more overt music.  This is his best Handel conducting to date.  One thing that I didn't care for and it has nothing to do with the performance and/or production, the latter of which is first rate, and that is the cover and the accompanying booklet photographs.  I don't care for any of it.  I love Fellini et al. and think \\"La Dolce Vita\\" a first rate film (though not his greatest achievement); however, aside from the fact that the these composers were pulling the wool over the Vatican official's eyes in almost open defiance and the fact the Fellini exposed mid 20th century Roman decadence (defiance / decadence = wicked) and the fact that Rome was the birthplace of both these arias and Fellini's film, there is absolutely no reason for the correlation.  Paris was the birthplace of both Marais and Godard, should Jordi Savall dress a la Jean Paul Belmondo in cheeky imitations from \\"Breathless\\" in his next Pieces de Viole CD cover? It may seem a silly comparison, I know, but that's how I see it.  Aside from the hideous cover art and design, everything is classy, first rate and a genuine musical treat; one that you won't regret buying.

B0006IUDXA|5.0|I had seen most of the MacGyver series back in the late 80's and early 90's when ITV used to show it every Saturday afternoon at 5:15pm, but never got to see all the series because Sky bought the rights half way through season 3. So when Paramount *FINALLY* released this fantastic show on DVD I just had to buy it. I still enjoy this show as much as I did back then. I have since bought seasons 2 and 3, and will also buy seasons 5, 6, and 7 as soon as they are released! <br /> <br />A must see T.V show for any fan of action and adventure. 10/10

Using both Kaplan and Princeton Review books offers the perfect well-rounded preparation. Princeton Review offers advice on how to read the questions and eliminate answers. ButKaplan has the advantage in sample problems (challenging and, for the most part, well-explained).<br /><br />In my mind, Princeton Review seems to have less respect for the test. They want you to beat it by understanding its design amd seeing through its tricks. Kaplan, on the other hand, wants to help you do well through thorough review of the material. Both are important appraoches, and they complement each other well.

It touches on the inextricably intertwined concepts of growth, self-determination, responsibility, accountability, self-awareness and success, just to name a few. Jack's principles clearly come from a lifetime of learning and he shares them in a way that is easy to digest and makes perfect sense. I have read this book twice and each time I'm done, I just go ahead and start it over again. It's really that good.
B000001DQG|5.0|The sequel to Goodbye Yellow Brick Road \\"Caribou\\" was written between tours. I don't know why most EJ fans shun it. <br /> <br />1. The Bitch is Back: A great song showing EJ returning. Fun and catchy and a hit in my book. I love to sing it. <br /> <br />2. Pinky: A nice laid back song about someone named pinky. Soft mellow chords from EJ. <br /> <br />3. Grimsby: A great toe-tapper about a man and his boat. Great work from Davey Johnstone! <br /> <br />4. Dixie Lilly: Catchy song, takes me back to Tumble Weed Connection. I like the train whistle from Ray Cooper. <br /> <br />5. Solar Prestige Agammon: I'm one of the few EJ fans who loves this song! Fun nonsense from EJ! <br /> <br />6. You're So Static: From the first few piano notes to the clam shells to the stomping drums to the blasting horns, this song wins my heart over the two hits TIB and DLTSGDOM. <br /> <br />7. I've seen the Saucers: Not too many songs I've heard about aliens. awesome vocal work! <br /> <br />8. Stinker: Old schoolish blues. Great horns and \\"down\\" lyrics. Way to Go Bernie! <br /> <br />9. Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me: I like this song. Who knows the the number of hearts it has touched <br /> <br />10. Ticking: Following the aucustic footsteps of \\"This Song Has Know Title\\" An 7 min epic about a boy who goes crazy and kills people. The lyrics alone sends shivers down my spine.  <br /> <br />11. Pinball Wizzard: Like most fans I agree that it kicks butt better than the Who's version. <br /> <br />12. Sick City: So far the only EJ song I've heard with a disorted piano. (I maybe wrong though) Me likes it! <br /> <br />13. Cold Highway: An audio flaw? Nice song with a slow bridge but I have to turn up the volume to hear it. <br /> <br />14. Step Into Christmas: Yay! I'm so glad that he made a Christmas song when he was young. I play it a lot durring the holidays. Great drums and guitar and everything! <br /> <br />I love this album and this quality reaches GBYBR standards! It's worthy to becalled an Elton John Classic! <br />

B0009IOR6Q|5.0|When I first sat down to watch this movie, I didn't know what to expect. I thought the movie was going to take itself seriously. WRONG! I couldn't stop laughing at all of the blatantly ridiculous stereotyping and corny one-liners! <br /> <br />This movie seems to balance on the line of seriousness and satire. It pokes fun at everything of that time, and yet the plot isn't really all that far fetched. There was also some \\"fantabulous\\" music in there as well. If you don't watch it for the plot, the actors (Johnny Depp included), or John Waters, then watch it for the music. <br /> <br />All of the actors gave stunning preformances and the rolls seemed to be tailor made to each of them. A better cast couldn't have been assembled if you tried. <br /> <br />Are there a few stereotypes? Yes. Is the plot predictable? Oh yeah. But it's also a fun movie that I would recommend you see at least once in your life. It's like a less serious version of Grease. So go see it. Now. I assure you that you won't be able to see it just once!

B000AWYOGE|2.0|*<br />Hello... Hollywood? May I ask a \\"special request\\" of you?<br /><br />PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE!!! *STOP* remaking influential Asian Horror movies! ENOUGH ALREADY! Okay??? Please STOP destroying these pictures and distorting the stories (and the impact) of the original Asian releases!<br /><br />Yes, I know we in America are lazy and don't like reading subtitles. Yes, I know 'conventional wisdom' insists that ''all [insert whichever respective 'ethnic group' here] look alike'' to us and that by giving us some of ''our own'' to look at makes it all the easier for us to 'relate to' and whatnot. Yeah, yeah... all well & good IF that's what you are all thinking over there sitting behind your executive desks and in your decision making 'groupthink' sessions. Fine. BUT PLEASE STOP CHANGING AND DISTORTING VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING ELSE about the original movie material your so-called \\"remakes\\" are based on!<br /><br />I can overlook-- even forgive --a few not terribly significant reshapings here and there (which is why I hold no grudge [no pun intended] against Sam Raimi's relatively 'faithful' remake of \\"JUON,\\" titled \\"THE GRUDGE\\"). But just like Gore Verbinski's overly-loud & over-the-top remake of Nakata Hideo's \\"RING,\\" Walter Salles has changed so much of the original movie presentation of \\"HONOGURAI MIZU NO SOKO KARA\\" that I was sighing and shaking my head throughout much of the movie. The changes were so many and so disturbing that I would have given real consideration to asking for my money back, had it not been for the fact that I saw it at our local ''second chance'' dollar-theater for the matinee price of fifty cents.<br /><br />As a 'stand alone' movie, for someone who's had no exposure to the original movie (which was also directed by Nakata Hideo), I'm not going to diss it too much; but if you have by chance seen Nakata's version prior to this one and you want to compare notes, be forewarned!<br /><br />I knew this movie was headed for trouble right from the very beginning when it became apparent that the \\"Yoshimi\\" character (Dahlia) spent no real time looking for housing and that the \\"Ikuko\\" character (Cecilia) was a real snotty little b*tch NOT because she was tired of walking & looking at places to live with her mother (as was the case in the original movie) but because she was just a snotty little b*tch. From there it was all downhill. The red \\"Mimiko\\" purse (which, for familiarity purposes, becomes a \\"Hello Kitty\\" backpack) is no longer central to the plot of the movie; EVERYBODY'S motivation(s) for their actions and behaviors have been thoroughly distorted to the point of non-recognition; the \\"Mitsuko\\" ghost-girl (Natasha) is no longer shrouded in mystery; and on and on!<br /><br />Typical of Hollywood, the \\"subtlety\\" of the original has been dispensed with and everything has been spoonfed to us -- much of which was never explicitly expressed in the Japanese film -- and where there WERE insights into the characters and motivations in that first film, these were either reshaped or covered over or done away with altogether. The only somewhat positive thing I can credit this particular remake for is that it managed to retain some of the eerie atmosphere of Nakata's film, an area where the remakes of \\"Ring\\" and \\"Juon\\" paid next to no attention.<br /><br />So I suppose it's going to be no great surprise to anyone when another team of Hollywood Hacks get their hands on Thailand's \\"SUTTER KODTID WINYAN\\" (''SHUTTER'') and totally & completely render it, too, into an unrecognizable pile of mish-mash.<br /><br />Here's a challenge for all of you Hollywood elitists:<br /><br />Rather than taking \\"GOOD\\" movies and ruining them by 'remaking' them (since it's become quite apparent by your endless hunger to produce remakes that you can no longer generate an original idea of your own anymore), why not dig up some of the many \\"BAD\\" movies out there (like \\"REPTILICUS,\\" \\"LASERBLAST,\\" \\"STREET FIGHTER\\" and \\"FANTASTIC FOUR,\\" to name a few) and try making them into something better? That way, you could do a much more convincing job of proving that you have ''creative'' talent instead of the ''destructive'' variety!ould do a much more convincing job of proving that you have ''creative'' talent instead of the ''destructive'' variety!
6305095442|3.0|I realize that it is very fashionable to love really bad films just for the love of their badness.  And Dead By Dawn is the worst kind of badness -- a totally awful sequel to a film that was a parody of the totally awful films I grew up with.  It is a film where one can actually see the actors suddenly realize that they are acting too well and, with a jerk, dumb everything down even more.  At some point one has to wonder whether Sam Raimi is making fun of the whole genre, just scream films, or me.  The latter, I suspect.  And everyone else who goes through contortions explaining why really bad films are actually 'cool.'<br /><br />Standard hokey plot - one after another a group of people are drawn to the cabin of an archeologist working on a translation of the Necronomicon.  Lovecraft turns over in his grave.  A section is read and draws the attention of an ancient evil.  Soon people are being possessed, the dead rise, and parts mix with axes and chainsaws in an ever-growing chaotic pile.<br /><br />Every effect is studiously arranged to ring a bit false.  While there are spectaular makeup jobs, the effect is intentionally comic.  But the comedy, the sight gags, the windows that are perpetually broken and then boarded up again, and the tiny cabin with it's infinity of rooms really don't hold the film together, any more than they would a burlesque show.  This is a film designed for intermittent attention.  Any 10 minutes tells you exactly the same thing as every other 10 minutes.<br /><br />As a result I kept staring at the cabin's clocks with the 'dead by dawn' refrain repeating in my mind, hoping against hope for a glimpse of sunrise.  As much popularity as this film enjoys, it never made it over my own bar, and I'm not really all that much of a snob.  But each viewer should decide for him or herself.  It is entertainment, after all, with all the comfort of the horrible made less so by our ability to laugh at it.
B00005LQ04|3.0|Jessica Harper truly sums it up when she says on here. I WANTED TO PLAY THE LEAD, BUT THE cast spoke  noenglish so i keptlaughing. Yet, her focused intense performance makes this film work for me, As an american studying ballet in Fryberg Germany she is believable as Suzy Banion. The film has some genuinely frigghtening moments and some hideously hilarious acting, oh god the international cast, the bad dubing, that soundrtrack oh god help.

B0006L16N8|2.0|Of course it was just a matter of time for a band to mellow out, but chris fell in love with Gwyneth and had kids what more does he have to accomplish. Remember how it took 6 months longer to finish, because even they knew it sucked. You know what I'm talking about if you bought the live cd and heard the two new songs, this is more of the same. The first six songs are painful, Songs 7,8,9,10, are great coldplay songs, 11,12,13 go back to the suckin'. I've been trying to make myself like them but there is just nothing there. There's always a good chance that Gwyneth exits this picture, if it doesn't happen soon the next cd could be worse. In ten years people will still be listening to the first two cds but not this one. I've seen them twice in concert, I will see them many more times.
B00005JNTX|5.0|Yes, the violence is completely over the top and sensational. Yes, it is difficult to believe that a single man could take on a squad of fully armored riot police and win.  These are not what make this movie what it is.  What makes this movie one of the best I have seen in years lies in three areas: <br /> <br />The first is believability of character.  I never onced doubted the  truth of these characters, definitely a testament to the skill of the actors involved. <br /> <br />The second is a distinct and totally immersive style.  The colors the lighting all serve to bring you completely into Sin City.  This is due mainly to the films close adherence to the books it was based on. In fact with the exception of a few lines of dialog , Director Robert Rodriguez could not have adhered more closely to the comics. <br /> <br />The third, and most important to me, is the completely real morality of this movie.  Morality in life is never black and white, although we might like it to be, it is always shades of gray.  This departure from your standard hollywood trash really puts this one over into 5star category.  This is one case where ambiguous is not a bad thing.  They are not all bad and they are not all good, they fall right in where the rest of us are. <br /> <br />As for the DVD itself, it comes with a very interesting behind the scenes featurette with cast interviews.  The DVD also shipped to me with a limited edition slipcover which is definitely an incentive to order early. <br /> <br />In summary this film has incredible style, raw emotion and a refreshing realistic morality. All of which serves to make this one of the best films to come out in any category in the past several years. <br />5 out of 5!

B00028HBKM|4.0|Although not completely accurate, it's the best and most realistic film of the suffering and crucifixion of our Lord.<br /><br />I had seen it the day it was released in theaters, but this was only the second time I've viewed it. It made for an interesting experience. Not only was i moved and drenched in tears...again, but i was also able to be more of a film critic this time. I noticed they reduced the amount of gore and injuries on the body of Jesus. It would have been much worse than what they showed. Not that that was their fault...it was most likely advised to them because audiences would already be in shock for what they were seeing. I would rather have seen it the way it actually happened, but this telling was enough to get the desired effect.<br /><br />As you watch Him recieve His stripes, you cannot help but think that, with every lash, another disease was just erased from our life. All our sickness was taken upon Him.<br /><br />I doubt that Mary stood under Him and was sprayed by His blood, but overall, this was an egrossing and powerful viewing experience.<br /><br />Children under 8 years old should not watch it, unless you feel they're truely mature enough. I would think it'd be too much for their young minds to grasp, but 8 and older should see it. Children by that age know right from wrong good enough. They should see what it took to have all their wrongs erased. It might make them appreciate things more as well.<br /><br />Some of you might think it traumatic for a child that young to watch. I disagree. I don't think God would let that happen. If your 8 year old watches this film and has nightmares, then I'd be fasting, praying and making sure my own life was in order. Because if that is the case, it's not the film that's giving him nightmares...it's evil spirits...in your home.<br /><br />****1/2 4 and a half stars (to earn 5 stars it would need to be Scripturally perfect)

0515123447|5.0|\\"Killing Floor\\" begins:  \\"I was arrested in Eno's Diner.  At twelve o'clock.\\"  The pace never slows, and the reader quickly learns that the protagonist and first-person narrator, Jack Reacher, is the toughest character to appear in print since Stephen Hunter introduced Bob Lee Swagger in Hunter's fine novel, \\"Point of Impact.\\"  Like Swagger (and Robert Parker's Spenser, and Thomas Perry's Jane Whitfield) Reacher is not a fully fleshed-out, three dimensional character; he is instead almost a mythological figure, a comic book super-hero -- Batman, only a lot tougher.  But Reacher is also smart, very smart, and it is a good thing that he is, because beneath the surface of this tough-guy adventure story lurks a genuine, Agatha Christie-caliber mystery! It is this combination of a great action hero and an intricately plotted mystery that raises \\"Killing Floor\\" to the top level of the tough-guy genre.  If one is looking for character development, elegant prose, and thought-provoking ideas in this genre, he would probably be better served by reading John D. MacDonald's Travis McGee books, or Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe books. But if one wants a good mystery and a great protagonist, there is no better place to start than \\"Killing Floor.\\"
B0002XDODU|5.0|First, let's explore a small detail concerning Rammstein in general.  How has a German band that has refused to sing in English with the exception of \\"Stripped\\" from \\"Seinsucht\\" and a chorus from \\"Amerika\\" off \\"Reise, Reise\\" managed to commandeer such a prominent place in American metal?<br /><br />  For myself, the lyrics have never mattered.  Some people like good lyrical content, others like the music, some like a combination of both.  You can access Rammstein lyrics on the web easily.  All I need is the stomp.<br /><br />  After a long day at work, or a need for an adrenaline boost to get you through heavy traffic in a big city, Rammstein provides the beat (which should never be overlooked) and the riffs.  Yes, the lyrics sound funny, but the banks of guitars locked in tighter than the lid on a Mason jar full of radioactive waste are the big attraction.  \\"Reise, Reise\\" also has a few tricks up its sleeve in addition to the martial beats and synthesizer atmosphere.  An acoustic number that still manages to conjure up images of the Nazi Army parading in pre-WWII Germany (not that Rammstein should ever be compared to Naziism - you just gotta admire that precision marching), a somewhat clumsy attempt at a swing beat, and a slap at the US in \\"Amerika\\" spice this platter up.  The best track for sheer power, however, is \\"Moskow\\".  Here, the guitars are multitracked into one note riffing that is one of the heaviest guitar tones ever - it would embarrass Tony Iommi!<br /><br />  The drawback to any Rammstein CD is the lack of guitar solos.  Obviously neither guitarist is eager to solo, but what few have made it onto CD were enough to convince me that at least one of them is a fine lead guitar player.  Some ripping leads would go down real good.  Other than that, \\"Reise, Reise\\" is stronger than its predecessor \\"Mutter\\" and the debut \\"Herzeleid\\", but not quite as catchy as \\"Seinsucht.\\"  Still, it's a headbanger worth the price.
B00000DHZJ|2.0|I think that artist whose all albums are good does not need any collections. They are just for money making purpose. Never buy collection if the artist has good albums to offer. <br /> <br />My major complaint is that there are too few late stuff. From unfinished album there should be Freedom, Angel, Room Full of Mirrors, Ezy Ryder, Drifting and In From the Storm. Maybe Stepping Stone too. Dolly Dagger and Night Bird Flying that are included, are not so good as those tracks I listed above. <br /> <br />Of course, to make album more comprehensive, there could have been some Band of Gypsys track in the end. And why not something like Pali Gap? Also Burning of the Midnight Lamp and Long Hot Summer Night (both from Electric Ladyland) would have been better than some tracks included - not to mention the title track from Electric Ladyland, in which Jimi proves how great singer he can occasionally be.

B00005JNTX|5.0|It helps to be familiar with Frank Miller's wonderful graphic novels (Sin City, batman returns,etc) to appreciate the incredible effect this movie has, but regardless this cinema delivers in full an amazing experience.  Consider it film noir on steriods, the atmosphere is so darkly textural that there is a complete suspension of disbelief and emersion into the hard and cold world of Sin City.  Acting and casting was superb.  It holds considerable violence, buyer beware.  You can't have a dark story about corruption, prostitution, murder, revenge, and redemption without some graphic scenes, but they are still treated with incredible skill.  My advice is to read the books first, then marvel at the interpretation to the screen, but regardless, it's the best movie I've seen in many years.  If you like that sort of thing, that is...
0375507256|5.0|I wasn't sure what I was getting into when I started this book and it quickly switched from one genre to another, but after investing some time into it I really enjoyed the weaving of the various plots and the pieces that connected them all. I found it incredibly enjoyable and a fun read.
B00042YBTK|5.0|I will never understand rock critics, especially the way they put a tag on a record or artist and manage to contaminate other critics with their wrong ideas. There are many many records in rock history which have been underrated, maybe sometimes rediscovered when some rock star casually let understand that \\"actually it was a big influence on me, even though I was the only one listening to it\\" and blah blah blah. \\"Love is\\" by Eric Burdon & The New Animals is one of likeliest to win this bizarre competition that will never be thrown (how sad critics are so reluctant to admit they were wrong). Try as a might, from the first time I listened to it back in 1977 (hey, I was just 7 when it came out!) to the last of the innumerable listens so far, I could never understand what was wroong with it, to dismiss it at best as lacklustre, out of focus and uninspired and at worst with the deadliest insult, \\"unlistenable\\". To me, this as a single collection stands as the absolute best of Eric Burdon as a vocalist and the music is so creative that it just bursts from your speakers as if alive, the band is very tight and very loose at the same time and the overall effect is totally mesmerizing. I like everything and I mean EVERYTHING this man has produced from 1964 to 1980 at least (plus his recent very good comeback album), but if I were to pick one for the Desert Island, it would be this one. Just think about the phenomenal covers, especially \\"River deep-Mountain high\\", or maybe you like experiments a lot and then you have \\"The Madman and \\"Gemini\\", but the track that will really blow your mind is the blues \\"As the years go passing by\\" with its moody beginning as an almost \\"normal blues\\" close to the version by Albert King, then Eric launches an incredible battle between a bluesy guitar and a very distorted one (one of the two is future Police Andy Summers!) that reaches an impressive climax only to be replaced by the out-of-this-world vocal return by Eric, who delivers one the mostpowerful blues vocal ever by a white man and then slowly fades away intoning \\"till the day I die\\" until it becomes inaudible and you feel like he's really dying. Listen to this record without preconceptions and you'll surely find many delights. Down with rock journalists!
B000000W5P|4.0|Yes, Some Girls IS awesome, though there are a couple filler tracks cluttering up the premises, it's still far better than the overrated Tattoo You, essentially a glorified odds-and-sods collection. The funk-disco thump of Miss You topped the charts and lost the band a bunch of fans. I'm not a big disco fan, but I love this tune! Bill Wyman's funky bassline; Sugar Blue's harmonica and a cool sax solo courtesy of Sonny Rollins all add up to make this one a just classic. When the Whip Comes Down is the resiquite cool, fast, hard rocker. A sort of punk tune, and it turns out these \\"dinosaurs\\" could play punk. I say SCREW their cover of Just My Imagination, they turn a lush masterpiece into an unlistenable piece of CRAP. Skip this, and get your hands on the Temptations' version. Trust me on that. The sleazy title track is more like it. THIS, ladies and gentlemen, is how you play rock 'n' roll: loud, crude and borderline offensive. Lies is a HUGE step down, a failed punk tune. And the downhill slide continues with Far Away Eyes, which wastes funny lyrics on an annoying country arrangement. Grrgh!!!!!!! Thankfully, things get better. First up is Respectable, the updated, Chuck Berry-esque blues boogie. Then Keith's Before They Make Me Run continues the stretch. It gets better - Beast of Burden and Shattered are amazing classics.<br /><br />Yeah, get your hands on this!
B000062Y44|5.0|A great soundtrack for the \\"About A Boy\\" movie. This eclectic, energetic, wistful music conjurs up a range of emotions depicted in the movie. My wife loves the CD too. Very original.
B000000W5F|3.0|No masterpiece, no awesome, definitive Stones release. Tattoo You is none of these. It's an \\"eh\\" album, an overrated disc that sometimes manages to live up to the hype (Start Me Up; Waiting on a Friend; Little T&A; Neighbors; Hang Fire), but mostly wallows in misery. Slave has a nice sax solo, but is way too long, and the ballads on side two (Worried About You; Tops; No Use In Crying; the \\"spacy\\" Heaven) all are miserable pieces of crap. Isn't this the band that once made masterful ballads such as Wild Horses, Moonlight Mile, Ruby Tuesday, Shine a Light, Let It Loose, No Expectations, and the immortal You Can't Always Get What You Want? Yeah, I thought so. What happend? But there are several great tunes. Start Me Up rocks, a true classic with an unforgettable riff and yada yada yada. Waiting on a Friend shimmers, great sax solo and poetic, thoughtful lyrics. Plus Little T&A is a big, dumb, fun piece of sleaze with great vocals from Keith. Hang Fire is cool, and Neighbors isn't bad either. I can take or leave this one. I'd recommend the Big Four plus Some Girls and A Bigger Bang, plus maybe Voodoo Lounge, instead.
1932100385|5.0|This is important information. I've been influenced by diet fads and I'm not even overweight. The book demystifies the subject of what we should eat. It's simple - vegetables. Not only that but it turns out that it's fun eating better and different food. The author obviously has his biases but intelligent readers will recognize them and benefit from this information nonetheless. Importantly though, this diet is what will prevent heart disease, cancer, and a number of diseases of affluence. And for crying out loud, quit drinking bovine secretions (cow's milk).
B000000W5B|5.0|The first time I heard GHS, I hated it. I thought it was miserable, half-baked and boring. Then I gave it another chance, and I changed my mind severely. It is none of those things. In fact, it has quickly slipped past Some Girls into my Top 5 Stones albums.<br /><br />The thing about this one is that it doesn't grab you immediately with the big hook song the way the previous four did. Dancing with Mr. D in truth can't compare to the previous four album openers (Sympathy for the Devil, Gimme Shelter, Brown Sugar, Rocks Off), and in fact isn't one of the Stones' better moments, but it's a decent song, slightly funky, just with laughable pseudo-Satanic lyrics.<br /><br />So onto track two. Here's where things start getting good. I really like 100 Years Ago, which merges country and funk - I love that \\"Call me laaaaazzy bones... ain't got no time to waste away\\" part in the end, not to discount the rest of the song - a good uptempo ballad. Even better is the next song, Coming Down Again. This was Keith's first vocal showpiece on a longish love ballad (not counting You Got the Silver, which was short and ended as a blues-rocker), and it's by far his best - he spent most the rest of his career with the Stones trying to recreate the song's hushed, smokey atmosphere, but this pounds all the others in the dust. Another bit to listen for is the sax solo. There are two other classic ballads here - I used to hate Angie, now I love its graceful strings, wonderful melody and Mick's all-out vocals (he sings, screams, whispers, croons, cries...), and Winter, again sung perfectly by Mick. Like the lyrics, too.<br /><br />But can the Stones rock? It's still the Stones, of course! Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker) is yet another winner, a funky radio favorite packed with wah-wah guitar, clavinet, epic horns and the maddeningly catchy chorus to end all maddeningly catchy choruses: \\"Doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo (babababababap!)\\" and then the lyrics... gritty, street-level commentary, Mick spitting \\"Heartbreakers... with your forty-fours... I wanna tear your world, I wanna tear your world a-pa-hart (Doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo (babababababap!))\\" What a SONG! Silver Train is close to All Down the Line, but I don't care - Mick Taylor's slide guitar won me over! And Starf#@)(%er rocks. Now, the lyrics were rather controversial (then again, any song titled \\"Starf#)!#er is bound to be controversial even if it preaches staying in school, saying no to drugs and chastity till marriage), but I think it's hilarious: the random celebrity name-dropping coupled with whatever sex acts Mick could think of (which were plenty, Mick being Mick). Oh, and they repeat the f-bomb a good 65 times). Fun, sleazy Chuck Berry boogie - just don't play it for the ten-and-under crowd.<br /><br />There's exactly one loser track, and it's Can You Hear the Music - if there's a hell for bad songs it can go there (where it would be awated by every Eagles hit except Already Gone). I like to skip it. The rest is normally quite good. First-rate Stones!!gritty, street-level commentary, Mick spitting \\"Heartbreakers... with your forty-fours...

B00004R99U|3.0|Let me start by saying that our family loves the original Pocohontas video.  When I first watched Pocahontas II, I was extremely disappointed to see Pocahontas wind up with John Rolfe.  What happened to John Smith?  Then I went back and reviewed my history and was reminded that Pocahontas DID in fact marry John Rolfe.  While Disney often plays fast and loose with the historical facts, they did get it right on this one.  Overall this is not a bad sequel.
B000000OSE|5.0|Ok, a while back I did a reveiw for UYI 2, but not for this one. I will say the same thing here that I did for that one. YOU NEED TO HAVE BOTH! Do not buy the single CD version that mixes some from this and some from 2. You miss out on a ton! If you can only afford one, my suggestion would be to get no.2, however, most fans would tell you that this is the stronger disc. EITHER WAY, you need to have both. This one contains more RADIO songs, heres my breakdown (I put a little star next to the extra noteworthy songs.)<br />RIGHT NEXT DOOR: I dont know why but I think this is the weakest song out of both discs. Just me?<br />DUST N BONES*: YES!<br />LIVE AND LET DIE: Better than the WINGS version, its enjoyable.<br />DONT CRY: Pretty great ballad.<br />PERFECT CRIME*: Very intense!<br />YOU AINT THE FIRST: Good tune for the not so good one nighters.<br />BAD OBSESSION*: If you love blues rock, like me, you'll love this tune.<br />BACK OFF BITCH: some more solid rock<br />DOUBLE TALKIN JIVE*: Short and sweet rocker with some sultry acoustic at the end (YOU DIG WHAT I'M SAYIN?)<br />NOVEMBER RAIN: You're bound to like this ballad, your girlfriend will too! Sneak this one in the stereo when you try to make your move, the ladies melt to this.<br />THE GARDEN*: Very excellent, you got guest vocals from ALICE COOPER and the the dude from BLIND MELON. Oh but hey, theres guest vocals from ALICE COOPER!<br />GARDEN OF EDEN: its punk.<br />DONT DAMN ME: OH YEAH THAT SUCKED! No, its awesome, man.<br />BAD APPLES: Another sub-par track, still rocks.<br />DEAD HORSE: I dig these lyrics.<br />COMA: Well a little long but stick with it cuz theres a lot of change ups, worth it just to hear him say \\"WHAT THE [...] IS GOING ON!\\"<br /><br />Yeah so thats that. GET BOTH. Thats the best peice of advice I can give you.<br /><br />TODAYS LESSON: nothing lasts forever, EVEN cold November rain.
B00006AW2O|5.0|Abkco reissued their 1963 - 70 Rolling Stones catalog to coincide with the Stones 40th anniversary \\"Licks\\" tour (and album). If the band's debut was aggressive, visionary, and inconsistant, this followup is more measured, detailed yet still swinging and authoritative - a big leap forward. And, they just kept leaping with their third (\\"Now!\\", an A plus album), but if you haven't bothered upgrading your old vinyl, or the terrible cds Abkco issued in 1986, the Abkco catalog now sounds superb overall. In this case, there are noteable 'bonuses'. The Stones may have covered some classic (and some forgotton) r & b, blues, and soul gems, but they always made them their own - the only competition might be the New York Dolls' covers on \\"Too Much Too Soon\\". Here they outrock Chuck Berry on \\"Around & Around\\", one of several tracks recorded at Chess in June '64. Now the Chess tracks can all be heard for the first time in beautiful stereo, and \\"It's All Over Now\\" sounds apocalyptic; the classic instrumental \\"2120 South Michigan Boulevard\\" appears in its full 3:40 glory (until now it had been edited at 2:08, just before Keith's great solo!). They write their manifesto on the hard funk original, \\"Empty Heart\\" ('is like an empty life'- how unpretentious, how true) and the oh-so-prophetic \\"Time Is On My Side\\" (mono take - the stereo version is found on \\"High Tide, Green Grass\\"). Only a fair \\"Under the Boardwalk\\" can be said to be less than excellent, and I for one don't understand how anyone could resist the scorching, revved-up \\"Suzie Q\\" from the whiplash guitars to the Chess-style handclaps mixed to the fore during the fade. This is by far the best sounding version of one early Stones classic, and it must be said that even at age 21 Mick Jagger had the power and confidence to own each song (original or cover). Charlie and Bill are already, here,  the best rhythm section in rock and roll, and with Keith and Brian still working together can I describe what it's like to hear this fantastic band, at a peak so early in their long, long, astonishing career? Like it's great to be alive. Again.
B000000W5P|4.0|Buying Stones albums has always been hard for me to do. I'm very rarely satisfied with the whole thing.<br /><br />HOT ROCKS is very good and STICKY FINGERS is a masterpeice. I have others but they virtually never touch the cd player. Even the ultimate fan fave EXILE, I just don't get the point. I'VE TRIED, but its just not my cup of meat I guess.<br /><br />However, SOME GIRLS, I find to be an enjoyable album, I don't know why. EXILE has the raw sound that I look for but the cuts just ain't there for me. SOME GIRLS is produced, and with a lot of late seventies party tricks that went into every thing from then. However, the songs were made to fit in with the time.<br /><br />They aren't as profound as some of the stuff on STICKY FINGERS but still can give a little edge. SHATTERED is there for that.<br /><br />Mostly though the sound is on the verge of disco. IT's GOOD THOUGH! MISS YOU, great tune!<br /><br />Its seventies pop, but its the STONES and its one of their few consistent records as far as I'm concerned. FAR AWAY EYES and BEAST OF BURDEN are ballads at opposite ends of the ballad spectrum.<br /><br />Yeah, it ain't the raw sixties stuff but I've got all that.<br /><br />Get a hits package if you are new.<br /><br />TODAYS LESSON: if you're downright disgusted, and life ain't worth a dime, find a girl with far away eyes.
B000AL730O|5.0|Working with a different producer (who noted he would not allow Paul to play any songs he didn't like) took Paul to new and unexpected places. For example, 'Too Much Rain': on first listen I was waiting for the melody to go to the same places it always does...the cliche or obvious. It didn't. It went somewhere unexpected and it took me a while to get used to it. Same too with the minor chords in 'How Kind of You'. Also true of the verses in 'Certain softness' on '...got me hooked...'. As someone who writes songs as a hobby, it's not an easy craft and it's all to easy to judge the artist. When I read that Paul really liked and was proud of this new CD, I took it to mean even he's not always happy with hiw own output of songs. Even the artist struggles to like all he/she does. Other highlights that make this CD a pleasure: the sparse instrumentation on 'How Kind of You'-holding back has not been one of Paul's strengths. The Abbey Road Like 'Promise to You Girl' with Paul's simple guitar riffs and great harmony vocals. The Beatle-like (and cocktail bar-like) piano on 'Certain Softness' reminicent of the lower piano keys heard on 'Not A Second Time'. Also, the way 2-3 of the songs end are dramatic and engaging: 'How Kind of You' and 'This Never Happened Before'. I don't think George Martin could have done as cool a job of producing this as Nigel did. PS: the Special Edition DVD gives great insight into the making of the CD. Sadly, in some of the shots, Paul looks like an old man sitting at the piano (in others he seems like a kid). I'm just glad he's still with us and hope he brings us more gems like this one.

0684800713|5.0|There is a reviewer (C. Hager) who trashes this book as being inane and uneventful. In fact, it is a story of relationships, desperation and reality.

1573223026|4.0|I'm excited to discuss this novel at our next book club meeting this Friday.  I'm sure some will love it and some will hate it.  This was my first Hornby read, and I really liked it.  My husband read his soccer hooligan one and loved it.   <br /> <br />The character that appealed to me the most was Jess; she was just SO outrageous.  It was funny how she was so predictable and yet spontaneous too.  The character work on the others was interesting too, but Jess took the cake.   <br /> <br />The whole premise was a bit contrived, but the group dynamic that it created totally got me to suspend my disbelief.
0141439807|4.0|In this somewhat atypical Jane Austen novel, Austen abandons her precise characterization and carefully constructed plots, usually designed to illustrate specific ethical and social dilemmas, and presents a much broader, more complex picture of early nineteenth century life. Though the polite behavior of the middle and upper classes is always a focus of Austen, and this novel is no exception, she is more analytical of society as a whole here, casting a critical eye on moral issues which allow the upper class to perpetuate itself. Fanny Price, the main character, is the daughter of a genteel woman who married for love but soon found herself in poverty. When Fanny's aunt and uncle, the wealthy owners of Mansfield Park, invite Fanny alone, of all the children, to live with them, Fanny enters a new world, where she is educated, clothed, and housed, but always regarded as an \\"outsider.\\"<br /><br />Through Fanny's two cousins, Maria and Julia, Austen shows the complex interactions of the upper class as they negotiate marriages, try to maintain the family's reputation and wealth, and react to those \\"beneath\\" them socially. Fanny, having experienced both poverty and plenty, comments on what she sees, and though she lacks the witty charm of some of Austen's other characters (such as Elizabeth Bennett), she shows an intelligence and conscience lacking among her cousins. Only Edmund, the youngest of the Bertram sons, pays genuine attention to her, and her love for him is real, though secret.<br /><br />This is a darker novel than Austen's others, showing conflicts between late eighteenth century rationalism and the growing romanticism of the nineteenth century. Sir Thomas maintains his wealth through his expedient participation in the slave trade, a business that his sons Thomas and Edmund abhor. Often unfeeling toward his own family, Sir Thomas also shows cruelty toward Fanny when she rejects a marriage he has negotiated for her to a man she does not love. Cousin Maria chooses to marry Rushworth for his fortune, but she succumbs to her passion for someone else, and introduces a romantic, new sexuality into the novel. Unfortunately, Fanny, though sweet and reasonable, is also quiet and predictable, while Edmund, the only other potentially empathetic character, is naïve and often appears to be weak. Austen's light touch and quiet humor, which make her other novels vibrate with life and come to a satisfying ending, are less obvious here, and the abrupt conclusion leaves many questions unanswered. Mary Whipples to marry Rushworth for his fortune, but she succumbs to her passion for someone else, and introduces a romantic, new sexuality into the novel. Unfortunately, Fanny, though sweet and reasonable, is also quiet and predictable, while Edmund, the only other potentially empathetic character, is naïve and often appears to be weak.

B00005JNEI|1.0|I've watched this movie almost 20 or more times, not because I like it, but because I want to know my enemy. This movie is for people who have no education, and seem to have no determination to study world affairs and government. Do we know enough about our complicated aliance with Saudi Arabia? Do we know enough about the Palestinian Israeli conflict? Do we know about the distructive socialist agenda of the ACLU? Do we know enough about the intricate aspects of our government and why we have Congress, the House, the Senate, and our system of checks and balances? Do we know about world history?

029784752X|4.0|When eleven-year-old Daniel Sempere awakens early one morning, screaming, because he has suddenly forgotten the face of his deceased mother, his devoted father comforts him. As dawn breaks, Daniel's father, a bookseller, takes him on his first visit to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a secret, maze-like library which preserves books \\"no longer remembered by anyone, books that are lost in time.\\" Each person who visits must adopt a book, guaranteeing that it will never disappear, and when Daniel sees The Shadow of the Wind, he knows it \\"had been waiting for me there for years, probably since before I was born.\\" Captivated by this book by Julian Carax, Daniel tries to find out more about its mysterious author and locate additional novels, but he discovers that some other unknown seeker is also searching for Carax's books--in order to burn them.<br /><br />Lovers of the Gothic romance will be handsomely rewarded by the action-filled plot, as a sensitive and loving young boy comes of age while trying to unravel the mysteries associated with the elusive Julian Carax. A ghostly apparition in the misty lamplight, a faceless man who seems to have an inordinate interest in Daniel, a sadistic police inspector, and an incarnation of the devil himself all materialize as Daniel begins his search for information about Carax.<br /><br />Heavy, sensual imagery creates a sense of foreboding, while night-time mists, storms, and winter cold add atmosphere to sensational scenes and coincidences. A mysterious photograph, letters which go astray, false identities, an abandoned mansion with a sobbing ghost, a matricide, an evil stepfather, thwarted love, mysterious disappearances, revenge which never dies, and murder most foul all complicate the action. The evil characters are truly villainous, Daniel and his father are truly virtuous, and the women whom Daniel and Julian Carax love are pure and true of heart.<br /><br />Though the novel offers a good escape, it is almost six hundred pages long. Extensive background information for virtually all the characters (and even a house) gives more information than the reader really needs, and many scenes could be compressed. Occasionally, the mood is broken by mild profanity and bathroom humor.

B000AP04FG|2.0|\\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\\" is a massive fraud thrust upon the naive moviegoing public who'd laugh every second to Sunday at this ludicrous thing if it didn't star Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Whole chunks of the plot aren't just missing - they've gone fishing. Don't fool yourself: The end of this movie is some cobbled-together compromise of a disastrous shoot; it resolves nothing, it's about nothing and involves no clear villain. Whatever it is writer Simon Kinberg created with this script, director Doug Liman used about half of it. The rest is bullets, Pitt's blue slushie eyes and Jolie's alien physique. This puppy's \\"Gigli\\" with nifty guns.  <br /> <br />John (Pitt) and Jane (Jolie) have hit a lull in their marriage. They're bored with each other, predictably so, since they're contract killers for rival death squads and neither spouse knows the other's profession. Not-so-coincidentally they're led to the same place for the same job, after which they discover each other's identities. Then they fight, a lot, trash their house, blow it up, make up, and then realize they're bosses are targeting them. Cue up elaborate car chase and final showdown in, yes, a sporting goods store against a slew of masked men. End of picture. <br /> <br />Once upon a time \\"Mr. And Mrs. Smith\\" starred Keith David and Angela Bassett as Jolie and Pitt's respective bosses. Their roles have been lopped off. Gone. Vince Vaughn and Kerry Washington, the best friends, play no role in the final act. It could be said we have no idea who the masked men are in the final scene, or who hired them. They don't speak, they get shot. Movies aren't required to have plausible stories, but if a contract squad is after you, much less two, chances are they'd be a little more subtle about it than this.  <br /> <br />The leads have requisite chemistry, but this Jolie \\"blue steel\\" persona is getting a little old. Here's a woman with pedigree and talent wasting time as the ice queen in forgettable B-movies. Pitt slums,too - it's been six years since \\"Fight Club\\" - but he has a humor about it. Jolie reserves whatever warmth she posseses for food missions and refugees.   <br />
B00005JLKB|5.0|When Smallville first came out I thought it was just another Superman movie.(yawn) BUT then a local TV station was showing previews of it because they are bringing it on this fall and it got me interested, so I ordered the first season from Amazon. I definatly was not disapointed and will have to get all the seasons. The cast is great, they couldn't have picked better people to play each of the roles. For some reason when I seen Chloe it reminded me of watching Veronica Marrs???? And of all things for me to hope to be Lex Luthors best friend should be unthinkable but he is a great guy in this season. I will recomend it to anyone. They won't be disapointed.

B0000DJZ8R|3.0|The story of the Joad family - and more than anyone, Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) is simple, realistic, and pretty heartwrenching. They are thrown out off their family land in the Dust Bowl and forced to move west, seeking mythical work as fruit pickers promised by some well-circulated handbills. Along the way, they deal with death, sickness, poverty, cruelty, oppression by the wealthy and jackal-like need by their fellow impoverished. It's not a happy story, and really, no one would expect it to be. The lead is played quietly but effectively by Henry Fonda, always very good as the somewhat yokel-ized, simple and silent everyman (as opposed to his friend Jimmy Stewart's monopoly on the clumsy but smart average guy). His performance is overshadowed, though, by Jane Darwell as Ma Joad, and John Carradine (yes, that John Carradine) as former preacher Casey. These are also quiet, strong performances, and it's in these performances that the real strength of the story comes out. You can relate to these people, to their hardship, and to their various reactions. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the film has a significant pacing issue that gets worse with every passing scenario. When the film starts, we get a good ten minutes of pure dialogue - no doubt lifted straight from Steinbeck - between Tom and Casey. This is riveting film because the characters are coming to life before our eyes. The same trick is repeated later, in other sequences that take their time: Ma Joad going through old possessions before the move, Pa Joad and the youngest kids trying to buy bread in a diner, and the climactic speech by Tom. As a director, Ford really seems to want to take his time with the material, and I wouldn't be too surprised if he'd originally wanted a four-hour film. As it is, though, we get a film of just 129 minutes (still at the long end, for the time), and for each of those remarkable sequences there's two or three that fly by so fast they don't have time to make an impact. In fact, a fairly pivotal point - that they lose more and more family members with each stop - is glossed over because there's not enough time to see every departure. You just hear the decreasing number, and the family drives on. Other scenes that should have been important, like the shocking death of one character, seem thrown away as transitions between bigger scenes. By the end of the film, it starts to feel so episodic that the ending just pops out of nowhere. <br /> <br />The ending is a problem, too. The book's original ending - exceedingly bleak, and a bit scandalous - would have been far too controversial for a film in 1940. (Although, ironically, the silent era would probably have done just fine with it.) Instead, we get an \\"inspiring\\" speech from Ma about how the Joads will just keep going and going, representing the \\"common people\\" - stirring sentiment, yeah, but it doesn't make any sense. The Joads have been torn apart as a family unit, and the idea that their ship is going to suddenly come in just over the next rise is laughably silly, and a betrayal of these characters. The whole point is that they, most likely, won't survive, and they'll be left as one more sacrifice on the road to progress. It's the same sort of goofy speech, patriotic or nearly so, that heralded the end of so many '40s-era B pictures. It's okay in that sort of context, because the material has an inherent cheesiness and, often enough, a propoganda message; \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is neither cheesy nor particularly complimentary toward the government. You can tell a producer forced this decision. <br /> <br />I haven't mentioned John Ford much in this review because he is, to me, almost an \\"invisible\\" director. His guiding hand is there - you can see it in the pacing, in the lingering close-ups on faces and long-shots of the truck moving slowly down the road, but he eschews the visual tricks of many other filmmakers of the time. In fact, the entire visual feel of the film is largely down to award-winning cinematographer Gregg Toland's beautiful photography (perhaps better remembered for \\"Citizen Kane,\\" the following year). No, the main way to tell a Ford movie is by this quiet, studious pace, and the use of a certain \\"company\\" of actors; many of those seen here, and especially Henry Fonda and John Carradine, would be seen again (or had been seen) in other Ford pictures. That's not a problem for me. The \\"invisible\\" touch is just as valid as the showier approach, and there's certainly no denying Ford was a talented man. I do feel, however, that this is not one of his more successful films - possibly, as I've suggested, because he might not have had as much control over the end product as he liked. It's still worth seeing, and it's still a good movie, but there are many other films - Ford films, even - that I would put above it.

B00003CX8V|5.0|I would first like to make the comment that this is no comedy.  For those that consider this film a valuable part of Hollywood cinema due to the comedic aspects need to get their eyes examined along with their minds.  I do not think that I laughed at all during this film, but I would like to mention that I do not think that is a bad thing.  Not laughing at this film means that it hit you at a different level.  I witnessed a beautiful film with some highly intelligent actors painting a dark and disturbing picture of a sexual world circa 1960.  I suppose I was thinking that this was going to be a \\"screwball\\" comedy, which completely threw me off balance when the events of this film occurred.  Never have I witnessed such a bold attack on the sexual revolution of the 60s and its effect on the business world.  It was a slap in the face to see the way that Billy Wilder represented corporate America and honestly, it felt really good.  To see this lonely man turned away from his apartment at all hours of the night because his boss needed a place to take their mistresses was sad, not funny, yet in The Apartment it worked beautifully.<br /><br />To begin, this film revolved around the actors.  If you would not have had such strong actors like Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine, and Fred MacMurray honestly conquering their roles than this film would not have succeeded as it did.  It won Oscars for a reason, and even watched by today's standard of Hollywood I think that everyone involved should be very proud.  Their work was the best Hollywood had to offer.  Lemmon successfully portrayed this hurt every-man that you could easily find yourself engulfed within.  MacLaine, beautiful in her young age, was an emotional powerhouse. Her eyes could have told the story without any words.  You could feel her emotions through her eyes, and it was outstanding.  I must say that my favorite actor in this entire film was Fred MacMurray.  His portrayal of the typical \\"boss\\" who seems to use his powers to control instead of help, was perfect.  In fact, even if you watch the film today, you may still be able to see your boss in MacMurray's portrayal.  For once, it was a solid cast.  It had a structured story that was heightened by sublime actors that knew exactly what they needed to do.  I would have to say that this is one of the greatest pairings in cinema history, these three together could have taken Hollywood by storm, and it is evident in The Apartment.<br /><br />As I stated before, the characters are exceptional, but coupled with their performances is a rich story that seems developed well before its time.  I was not expecting to see such a sexual driven film released from the 60s.  Films of this nature typically hint towards sex, but never quite spell it out, but in The Apartment it is in your face throughout the course of the film.  From the opening sequence until the end, sex seems to be the biggest underlying theme of this film.  In the world of C.C. Baxter, all he seems to know is sex, business, and the occasional conversation with the elevator girl.  You can't help but wonder if that wasn't what was going through the minds of our fathers as they headed to the corporate world on a daily basis.  It was such a slap to the face of the day to day America.  To think that in this nation portrayed with family values and moral uprising that The Apartment would emerge as the breakout film of 1960.  It shocked me.  I think the reason that it did so was because of the strong writing, the powerful story, and the emergence of such innocent \\"characters\\" (as mentioned above).  There were moments during this film that I honestly wanted to walk into the television, tell everyone to stop, and explain what was happening because I didn't want anyone to get hurt in the end.  Isn't that a sign of a long-lasting powerful film?  To me it is.<br /><br />Overall, I must say that The Apartment left my jaw on the floor.  While my wife will disagree with me, I thought that itwas a brilliant moment in cinematic history.  Jack Lemmon could not have been handed a greater roll, nor could he have pulled it off with such beauty and pizzazz.  The story will shock and amaze you for nearly two hours.  We are taken into a world in which we feel comfortable in, we feel as if we have been there before, and we can only thank the imaginative mind of Billy Wilder for that.  He takes those moments in our lives that we wholeheartedly want to forget and places them in the window for all to see.  His mockery of corporations, of the small man working his way to the top, and the disasters that follow are nothing short of classic.  I have never witnessed a film quite like this and I hope I never do again.  The Apartment was a once in a lifetime enjoyment, and I cannot wait to revisit it soon to see what I may have missed!<br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****hat it was a brilliant moment in cinematic history.

0790729644|5.0|Unforgiven is one of my favorite modern westerns including Silverado and Outlaw Josey Wales.  It is more akin to the latter in that the tension builds up on the character until he just EXPLODES all over the story.  With Josey Wales its much sooner in the story, unlike Unforgiven when you know by reputation that Eastwood's William Munny is a low-down, dirty killer who struggles with what he is good at (\\"the killin'\\") and the promise to lead a better life imposed on him by his now deceased wife.   <br /> <br />  Gene Hackman is great as the law man \\"Little Bill\\" Daggett, who has a dark side that is much darker than most villians that you'll find.  Richard Harris has a small part as a famous gunslinger, that I'd like to have seen expanded, but he plays his part as another would-be killer who gets in Little Bill's way.
B000A7Q2DM|3.0|First off, this is good music. I give it three stars simply because of the copy protection encrypted within the cds \\"enhanced\\" material. The music itself, I give a 4, but since I am unable to find a way to import the music files to Itunes, It gets a three. Restricted burning is unbelievable. When you buy a cd, I'm told you buy the rights of the cd for personal use. Thus putting myself under the assumption that I will be able to do what I please with the music, as long as I do not distribute it illegally. In the future, I will not buy another cd with this type of copy protection within, reguardless of importance the music is to myself. A sticker on the packaging would be nice, allerting the consumer of the new system. I, at least, have never come into contact with the protection; I buy about 10 cd's a month. If I am going to start having to research lables, and/or cds to see if they carry the encryption, so be it.<br /><br />Does anyone know where the \\"secret files\\" are uploaded to when you put the cd in so I can delete them? Please post.
B000AA305M|5.0|The music is great.  I especially liked Alibi and Lately tracks. <br /> <br />     However, as manufactured by Sony, this CD is defective.  I return defective stuff. <br /> <br />     I don't understand why Amazon didn't let its customers know that this CD does not work with an iPod, and, when you put the CD into a Windows computer - you are required to agree to a complex legal agreement that limits your ability to listen to the CD in the way that you want. <br /> <br />So, I'm sending my CD back.  I expect I will avoid Sony stuff when I can.  So, I might see a movie they distribute, but am not likely to buy any of their CDs or electronics.  And, Sony used to make great stuff.  Not lately. <br /> <br />I don't believe in rewarding stupid greedy companies that go out of their way to annoy their customers. <br /> <br />If I had known that the CD was crippled I would not have purchased it.  I'm annoyed at Amazon for not providing this information (I know I said that, but I really annoyed). <br /> <br />I'm reluctant to buy other new CD(s) I would have bought, like the new Dar Williams, because I don't need this grief. <br />
B0000DK3A1|4.0|As the title itself says, I'm extremely ashamed to admit this but I like this album. I think Britney's song composers have improved a lot. Or better, she made the only right decision she ever made to change composers, and here's the result: a very cool and enjoyable cd!! She's very clever, she knows what's fashion...she turned her pop and catchy music into hip hop one, with new beats. I personally find that in this collection even her voice has got a little little little bit better!! Thanx to the back vocals and to the fact that she doesn't sing so much, she \\"raps\\", she talks. Better for the listener!! ;0) Well ,my fav songs are Me Against The Music, Outrageous, Brave New Girl (okay this is the most silly song in the whole cd but I can't help it, it was the first one to capture me when I had my first listen) and Breathe On Me, while I really don't like The Hook Up and Early Mornin'. I didn't like very much the single Everytime, too banal. I have the copy with only one bonus track, The Answer. Very cool but it looks like Slave 4 U, like someone else has said before. I've heard also Don't Hang Up and it's a really good song, a bit weird for Britney's standards. Pity that these 2 songs weren't in the \\"official\\" tracklist!! I think this is the best album by Britney, and I have to say that although I hate her and her commercial music. If u absolutely wanna buy something of her, then buy this, it's worthy!!! :0) <br /> <br />Here are my votes: <br />Me Against The Music 5/5 (catchy) <br />(I Got That) Boom Boom 5/5 (dddanceeeee) <br />Showdown 3.5/5 <br />Breathe On Me 5/5 (very sexy) <br />Early Mornin' 2.5/5 (boring) <br />Toxic 4/5 <br />Outrageous 5/5 (catchy) <br />Touch Of My Hand 4.5/5 (sexy) <br />The Hook Up 2/5 (sooo boring) <br />Shadow 5/5 (cool) <br />Brave New Girl 5/5 (although the most pop in the cd) <br />Everytime 3.5/5 (so fatuous) <br />Me Against The Music Rmx 3/5 (useless) <br />The Answer 4.5/5 <br />Don't Hang Up 5/5 (it isn't in this cd edit but it's cool) <br />
B0009A1AS2|4.0|Dream Theater's last release, Train of Thought was a very aggressive and powerful album with a lot of amazing guitar riffs and equally powerful drumming. However, their new release Octavarium is a more peaceful album with elements of all their previous albums. The first track The Root Of All Evil is most similar to Train of Thought because it has an unstopable beat and a powerful guitar riff dominating the song. This actually is my favorite song from this album, the solo is really incredible, but short. Next is a relitively slow song that I personally am not really attracted to. However some may like this more than me. Third is a song called These Walls. This song is really catchy especially at the chorus \\"Tear down these walls for me, stop me from going under.\\" Overall a good song probably my second favorite. Next is a song that sounds very simular to U2 entitled I Walk Beside You. This song is okay but Dream Theater isn't really known for copying the sounds of other bands. A relaitively good pop song though. Next is a really heavy song called Panic Attack which is dominated by the spit of John Petrucci's lethal guitar riffs and Jordan Ruddess' keyboard synth sounds playing in unison. An alright song however I really don't like the singing durin ghte chorus, hi svoice is rather high and I really don't think his voice is great for the really high sounding notes. Next is a song entitled Panic Attack which I found to be very simular sounding to Stockholm Syndrome by a band called Muse. A pretty good song with a lot of nice drumming especially when the song starts with the low keyboard sounds and increases in power with powerful stomping drums. Next is a song about war called sacrificed songs that clocks in at around 9 minuites. I like this song although it is kind of slowish, the singers vocals in this song are truly amazing. Finally the last track, the title, Octavarium is a 24 minuite song that is relitively soft compaired to their other releases, I wasn't really moved by this song because it didn't really capture my attension. Perhaps a few more times listening to it could change my mind. Overall, Octavarium is a good release due to The Root of all Evil, Sacrificed Sons, These Walls, Panic Attack, and Never Enough. The rest of this album didn't really stand out too much to me but I tend to like the harder and more faster songs of Dream Theater's past releases Metropolis Part 2: Scenes From A Memory and Train Of Thought. This album DOES deserve a good listen though if you are a fan of one of the best progressive metal bands of all time, Dream Theater.

B00012L786|5.0|\\"Pickup on South Street\\" was the 6th film directed by the colorful Samuel Fuller, who started his career as a tabloid journalist in New York City, followed that up writing 7 pulp novels and 7 screenplays, and fought as an infantryman in World War II before arriving in Hollywood to become a prolific director and screenwriter. Fuller adapted this screenplay himself from an unpublished story by Dwight Taylor. Career pickpocket Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark) lifts a wallet from a woman's purse on the subway. Unbeknownst to him, the woman, Candy (Jean Peters), was under surveillance by federal agents who were waiting for her to deliver an item to Communist agents. When Candy discovers that her wallet was stolen, she regretfully reports to her ex-boyfriend Joey that she is unable to make the delivery for him. Joey (Richard Kiley) is frantic to track down the missing wallet and the valuable microfilm that it contained, and he begs Candy to use her street connections to help him.  Her efforts lead her to Skip, but not before Police Captain Tiger (Murvyn Vye) and Federal Agent Zara (Willis B. Bouchey) have told Skip what the wallet contained and implored him to turn over the microfilm.<br /><br />At this point in Richard Widmark's career, he had begun to consciously depart from the sleazy villain roles for which he is so fondly remembered by film noir fans. But he was a contract player, and he was assigned to \\"Pickup on South Street\\", and he's terrific in it. The film's major themes are the sadomasochistic relationship that develops between Skip and Candy and the validity -or not- of the concept of patriotism among petty criminals. Writer/director Samuel Fuller had some admiration for the skills of pickpockets and strove to recreate their mores realistically. They are referred to by the slang term \\"cannon\\" in the film, and Skip eschews politics to the point of mocking it. Unmoved by appeals to his patriotism, Skip asks, \\"Are you waving a flag at ME?\\" Widmark rises to the dual challenge of making Skip unpatriotic without offending the censors or alienating the post-war audience and of making him likable even as he vacillates between gentleness and brutality toward undeserving Candy. Thelma Ritter also gives a memorable performance as Moe, a pathetic woman who sells neckties and information to whomever will pay, saying, \\" I have to go on makin' a living so I can die.\\"<br /><br />The DVD (Criterion Collection 2004): \\"Sam Fuller on Pickup on South Street\\" (19 minutes) is an interview by film critic Richard Schiekel filmed in the last years of Fuller's life.

0312323859|5.0|It's amazing that you can actually like a character who starts off telling you how beautiful she is, but Giffin pulls it off. Darcy is so flawed, so completely oblivious to the world around her, yet I couldn't stop reading about her. This book is every bit as good as Something Borrowed, and Darcy may even be more interesting than Rachel. I have to admit, I was hoping they'd reconcile their friendship, but wasn't distracted by Dex and Rachel - Darcy was just too darn interesting a character. Readers who loved Something Borrowed will not be disappointed.
B000AADYRQ|3.0|I think Ned is being a tad harsh, but overall, this album is slightly disappointing from Death Cab, after the comparative brilliance of Transatlanticism. It is consistent and the tunes are uniformly catchy. I do agree with Aidin Vaziri's assertion in that there are perhaps one too many ballads. But there are some excellent tracks here, namely, \\"I Will Follow You Into The Dark\\" and \\"Sarah's Song.\\" \\"Soul Meets Body\\" is also very catchy and seems the logical choice for first single. Overall, the album is good and probably one of their most accessible releases to date. I guess from Death Cab, I'd expect something more heart-grabbing, rather than just \\"good.\\"
B0009XNUK0|5.0|This is just as strong and vibrant as the box set that came 8 months before it! I sent a copy of it to my uncle in Georgia a few days after it came out on July 12! Sony made a smart move to release this after Michael Jackson was declared innocent.  This one, like the box set, combines his Jackson 5 hits, his Jacksons hits and his solo hits going up to 2001.  Past albums stopped at Thriller, but this goes even further to Invincible.  But my favorites are on here, from Got To Be There, I Want You Back, Shake Your Body, Blame It On The Boogie, Off The Wall, Beat It, Billie Jean, In The Closet, Remember The Time, Another Part Of Me, Bad, Dirty Diana(the hummable song), Smooth Criminal, Dangerous, and You Rock My World. The sound's a little loud, but I think they wanted a full, complete listening experience to the listener.  The packaging said 37 songs, but there are 38 songs here, and what a spectacular collection of Michael's hits. I know there are people saying, \\"But why isn't Butterflies or State Of Shock on here?\\"  It must have been tough deciding what to put on here, because Michael has always made quality music.  To Usher, Justin Timberlake, Omarion and the top singers/dancers, you are all great artists, but you need 20 more years or so in the business to catch up to the greatness and artistry of Michael Jackson! Keep working at it! I could play these CDs all night long because all my favorites are on here! Can you hear those funky beats and rhythms in the distance when you hear this album going down an interstate for 100-170 miles or so on a road trip?  This is yet another great compilation album of Michael's hits, probably better than 2003's Number Ones. Get multiple copies to send to your family members and friends!
B000069AT7|5.0|THIS SHIPMENT HAD BEEN VERY FAST AND EASY. THE ITEM IS ONE OF TH BEST I HAVE EVER SEEN. IT IS THE PERFECT PRODUCT.
B00003CXTG|1.0|This movie is so bad I don't want to waste my time writing why. One can easily read everyone elses' comments to see why. I just had to add my two cents worth. If you want to see a good movie about Pearl Harbor, watch \\"Tora, Tora, Tora\\". If you want to see a better movie about Spitfires, watch \\"Battle for Britian\\". If you want to see a better movie about The Doolittle raid, watch the movie \\"Jimmy Doolittles' Raid on Tokyo\\". So on and so forth...What a terrible movie.
B0009VRHLK|5.0|however I cannot personally endorse the entire film.  This is because my girlfriend is a strict evangelist Christian type, so she took our copy of the movie to a local movie editing place (which are perfectly legal per the Supreme Court) that removed a scene which I hear contains some naughtiness.  But I did see the rest of the movie and I can say that it is downright brilliant, and more beautiful than seeing life through my own eyes.  I also liked the driving scenes because for unrelated reasons the state of Florida permanently revoked my driver's license, so driving scenes bring back fond memories of, well, driving.  By the way what was in that missing scene anyway?  I would search for it on the Internet but my girlfriend got us signed up on one of those ISPs that filters things.  But I stay with her because she can drive.
B000ASATWQ|5.0|This album hits every point on the spectrum of what people love about music.  Right off the bat it's lyrically stunning and melodically mesmerizing.  This album is deep without being cheesy and the music is creative and deliciously un-pop.  It moves the listener through great beats, love songs, and fun dance songs without seeming contrived and it never loses it's distinctive flavor.
B0009MAO46|5.0|TOY STORY is the first animated film completely done on computer, but it's got so much heart and humanity in it, that's a moot point.  Carefully caressing the toys of our youth, from Mr. Potato Head to Battleship, TOY STORY is a delight not only for children, but for adults as well.  With a marvelous cast of vocal talent (Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Annie Potts, Don Rickles and Jim Varney to name a view) and a loving appreciation of the fragility of childhood, TOY STORY is an amazing cinematic achievement, with many delightful inside jokes and humorous asides.  Woody's fear of being replaced by the supercharged Buzz Lightyear is poignant; the evil Sid and his mistreatment of toys bears a hidden message to kids to take better care of their belongings.  TOY STORY is warmhearted and unprecedented fun for all.
0553284347|5.0|This book proved to be such a help in working to overcome my abusive childhood and dealing with my adult relationship with my abusive parents. I wish the author would be available in my area for therapy! It is written in a very readable style; not at all like a textbook. I have recommended this book to so many people.  I wish I could rate it higher, I think this should be one of the recommended books to all people dealing with abusive \\"Toxic\\" parents.
B000777J2S|1.0|Thank goodness Red Star \\"Macca\\" from Yarmouth has pointed out that this album is terrible, I was beginning to think that I was the only one.  It's awful, it really is.  People, get a grip on reality - no, it's not what you watch on TV - and listen to this away from the hype.  It sounds like Spike Milligan singing Danny La Rue's greatest hits.  Abysmal.  If there was a zero star rating, this album would win it.
B00005JNJV|4.0|There's certainly some fun to campy versions of comic books -- such as the previous batman movies -- but for my money this is the way a comic book is meant to be adapted. At least this series.<br /><br />This movie has resonance and relevance. It has heart, soul, and action. It has an interesting, engaging plotline filled with multi-dimensional human beings, struggling with human emotions.<br /><br />All of which heightens the action-adventure because it gives it real stakes.<br /><br />Like Spiderman I & II, Batman Returns heralds a new age of comic book and action films. Films that are intelligent, written as well as any highbrow drama. And the audience interest is obvious. They bought tickets for these films. They didn't buy tickets to STEALTH, which lacked these resonant elements.<br /><br />Similar to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, these films all have the chance of resurrecting the power of myth in our movies. And as we become used to them, there is the very real chance of creating new myths for our new millennium.<br /><br />Truly, Batman has begun again in BATMAN BEGINS, and I truly appreciate the skillful and soulful work of Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer.<br /><br />Derek Rydall<br /><br />Screenwriter - Script Consultant - Author<br /><br />Founder, ScriptwriterCentral.com
B00063EMJG|3.0|The DVD disc in this package is not full DVD Audio that has been used for Greendale, Harvest, American Stars and Bars and On the Beach (ie MLP compression). The type of compression on this disc is the type that is present on movies. This is a very strange move as Neil is a big fan of the DVD Audio format, and I cannot understand why thislower quality format has been used at the sacrifice of the spinning vinal disc when a song is playing, when true DVD-Audio could have been so easily used. Does anyone know why this has been used and if the forthcoming Prairie Wind uses the true DVD Audio MLP compression <br />The music is good, but the DVD disc is fairly pointless
0070511136|1.0|While I appreciate the effort to create a book on consultative style selling, this book just doesn't cut it. It may be a little better than the hardsell techniques espoused by some sale trainers, but it doesn't hit it.  <br /> <br />Obviously this book was written by people who have never sold anything besides books and overpriced seminars. Also quite obvious, is that the reviewers giving this book 5 stars have never sold anything either and are merely creating aliases and giving themselves \\"helpful\\" votes to earn points for an \\"Amazon Top 1,000 Rating\\" which is about as worthless as this book. <br /> <br />One reviewer made a challenge here sometime ago. Doesn't look like he/she got any takers. Now I wonder why?
B000000IT1|1.0|I don't have anything against long compositions and/or extended solos. Provided, that is, that you actually have something to say. But listening to Atom Heart Mother is like listening to somebody who takes an hour to explain to you that 1+1=2. Fascinating, indeed.
B00062ZE3U|5.0|All the critics, reviewers and DJs are saying that if you like Evanescence, Within Temptation are your new favourite band. Well, Evanescence have never been my favourite band, HIM are and always will be. However, I do like them, and as soon as I heard \\"Stand My Ground\\", I went out and snapped up the album. I was pleasantly surprised. It is a mixture of harder, faster songs, with slower, more graceful string and keyboard-based songs. Sharon Den Adel's voice soars on every song, not a note out of tune, and is every bit as beautiful and haunting as it is reputed to be.<br /><br />1. \\"Intro\\" - 4/5. It is beautiful, but somehow you just want the actual songs to start.<br /><br />2. \\"See Who I Am\\" - 5/5. Busting in straight away, it grabs your attention from the very start; a fantastic song.<br /><br />3. \\"Jillian (I'd Give My Heart)\\" - 5/5. Fantastic yet again. There is some really impressive choral work going on at the start and throughout, mainly standing out in the chorus. Sharon Den Adel's lyrics are very sweet during the verses, but then burst out in the chorus.<br /><br />4. \\"Stand My Ground\\" - 5/5. The radio classic. It's extremely catchy, a definite hit. The one that started it for me.<br /><br />5. \\"Pale\\" - 4/5. This is a slow song, with gorgeous keyboard work and a beautiful chorus, with what sounds like pan pipes accompanying it.<br /><br />6. \\"Forsaken\\" - 4/5. Bursting with pomp, right from the start. Not a favourite of mine, but nevertheless, a very good song.<br /><br />7. \\"Angels\\" - 5/5. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. The lyrics are brilliant, and the tune is flawless. Sharon's voice is definitely angelic in this song, and it is a real feel-good one. In a gothy way.<br /><br />10. \\"Memories\\" - 3/5. Another slowy, it is a little too slow. The vocals as usual are impeccable though, and is worth a good listen.<br /><br />9. \\"Aquarius\\" - 4/5. This song's tune is a little unusual in my opinion, and also not one of my favourites, but I wouldn't skip it when listening to the CD. It is technically a very good song.<br /><br />10. \\"It's The Fear\\" - 5/5. This song is absolutely amazing, and when it gets to the chorus, you just want to jump around and dance! A personal favourite. The lyrics are quite simple, but the tune is fantastic.<br /><br />11. \\"Somewhere\\" - 3/5. Very slow and light in texture. If you like that sort of thing, this song is for you. Technically speaking, it is a very well put together song, just not one that does a lot for people like me.<br /><br />12. \\"Destroyed\\" - 5/5. This song is also amazing, as it has a really exciting, gothic feel to it. The better bonus track on the UK edition.<br /><br />13. \\"Jane Doe\\" - 5/5. Unusual in its sound, kind of like \\"Aquarius\\". It has quite a dark sound to it, especially the growling male vocals during it. Definitely worth a listen.<br /><br />If you haven't bought the UK CD/DVD edition, chances are you haven't got the last two tracks as they are bonus tracks. But I definitely recommend that you download them, or get them off someone who does have them, they are fantastic and definitely worth the effort of getting them.<br /><br />All in all, in my opinon, the best songs on this album are \\"Angels\\", \\"It's The Fear\\" and \\"Destroyed\\". Go get this album, it's amazing!ng. <br />10. \\"It's The Fear\\" - 5/5. This song is absolutely amazing, and when it gets to the chorus, you just want to jump around and dance! A personal favourite.

0694003611|5.0|This is my daughter's favorite book!!  It's so simple, so touching, so sweet.  When you read this book to yourself you will probably wonder what the big deal is, but when you have a child on your lap and you don't rush through the book but you take your time and point to the pictures as you read, you will be taken into another world.  'Goodnight Moon' just goes to show that a book doesn't need to be long to be good, and this book isn't just good, it's wonderful!!<br /><br />Goodnight Stars<br /><br />Goodnight Air<br /><br />Goodnight Noises Everywhere<br /><br />:) :) :) :) :)<br /><br />I get a smile on my face just reading to myself as I think how much my little girl loves this classic tale.<br /><br />***** HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION
B00009YXHN|5.0|Whilst this DVD looks like it is a direct transfer from a Vestron Video tape, with new credits for some of the recent companies( Vestron went bust, I heard), the DVD is a decent watch, and has everything I loved and vaguely remember.  Unless there is something done in the recovered edition that I am unaware of for  REANIMATOR, West is NOT killed, and Megan Halsey is not saved ... Megan most definitely dies, and she may be reanimated, but then it is conceivable that someone had dismembered her in death if her reanimation was partial( especially since Megan's  heart is separated, but it may be a convenient plot point, however... WHO CARES ?? ). What is really aggravating about this budget disc, is that the extras are clearly  available, but if you check out the other disc reference for BRIDE OF, the prices are outrageous ... especially  when REANIMATOR MILLENNIUM EDITION has a bundle of goodies with it, and is virtually the same or comparable price as the minimalist BRIDE OF REANIMATOR.  The FX  are great. Screaming Mad George, and the other FX  people do a superb job, even with the over the top Bat winged head of Dr Hill . The elements are virtually  seemless.  For the nature of the story, it is quite a decent piece of work.  At worst it is a very fun popcorn film, at best, it is a fun horror-comedy that has \\"Dr West\\" spouting many dead-pan and funny lines that totally work with an actor like Jeffrey Coombs.  The So-called Nudity is extremely minimal; the gore is not excessive, and is always in context ( what do you expect when an arterial line is severed????), and basically it works.  It's not as good as the original, nor BEYOND, but it is a great fun piece... or pieces, and dare I say, a cut above the rest that gets under your skin :-)
0767853636|1.0|A John Huston disaster! Some nice touches, a great Annie and a nifty Punjab..but too much overacting in this overproduced musical.  But thank heaven the songs weren't ruined by this rococo mess. <br /> <br />Call me spoiled, but l saw and greatly prefer the Broadway version which respected a more sophisticated audience and which gave us several \\"inside\\" and tongue-in-cheek jokes. The movie rams everything down the viewer's throat. And the ending was worthy of Ziegfeld...who's been dead for awhile.
0307276902|5.0|I had a hard time finding this book in my local bookstore, because, based on the description I had heard of the storyline, I assumed it would be located in the literary fiction section.  When I finally asked for help, I was ushered to the non-fiction area, and to my surprise, there was the book!  This amazing memoir of the author's time spent in rehab for an addiction to alcohol and crack is one of the best books I have ever read.  The prose is written in an almost poetic style, and his thoughts just flow from his mind onto the pages.  One of the most compelling aspects of the story is the honesty with which he treats the discussion of his struggle, as well as the struggles with those in his life - his family, his friends, and the people he meets while in rehab.  As the reader, you root for James in his struggle, and want to help push him to triumph.  So wonderfully written, this book is recommended for anyone who wants to share in the unbelievable life of one of our fellow human beings.  Excellent!
B00005JKDQ|5.0|My 4 year old grandson thoroughly enjoys this movie and will watch it over and over again.
B000A6T1KE|4.0|For me I thought it was one of the better Movies-ST:II is still my favorite. The only problem with ST Movies is their inconsistancy. There are so many things that they allude too, but never include as part of the ST Universe. I was disappointed in the orginal DVD release of this movie. But I kinda figured that they would do something like this. I hope they at least put in all the deleted scenees (i.e. the part you see in the trailer but not the movie where Shinzon is in the Turbolift and says-\\"Don't fear\\"!) I think certain scenes if included would have made the movie better. Possibly from the viewer's perspective they expecte dmore walking into the movie.
B000AL730Y|4.0|I read the online reviews and like many was a little untrusting of the rave reviews, however I must say this is one of his best solo albums and nobody paid me anything to say that!    Unlike many, I discovered Paul McCartney before the Beatles and have every album he's recorded. I would rank this one up with \\"Flaming Pie\\" and almost hitting the heights of \\"Flowers in the Dirt\\" which remains my favourite. If you don't own it you're missing out!    Some gems on this album are \\"fine line\\", \\"follow me\\", \\"too much rain\\", \\"friends to go\\" all of which are very catchy. Some fun songs such as \\"English tea\\" bring some diversity to the album.    As for comments about which Beatle was the true talent - give it a rest. Paul, George and John were/are phenomenal song writers, legends of our time.
B00006EXL5|5.0|that sounded gay but... this is a great cd MCR rox these cud all be singles but they wont (:D) <br /> <br /> <br />great CD go buy!
B00006BTCA|5.0|'Turn on the Bright Lights' is a stunning first album. Effortlessly synthesising the influences of Joy Division, Echo and the Bunnymen, The Chameleons and even The Cure, they nonetheless escape the charge of being too derivative, as their idiom, though tinged with nostalgia, is cathartic, angular, sharp-edged and above all, fresh. Interpol sound like The Strokes without the slavish modishness and adolescent egotism. Remarkably mature for their age, they write songs that drip with the neon of anomie and disenchanted hedonism. In fact, it is textural singularity that defines their debut. Without falling victim to monotony, they have crafted an album whose darkly atmospheric consistency lends it cohesion and continuity. As a consequence, 'Turn on the Bright Lights', unlike most albums the current 80s revivalism has produced, should be viewed not as a patchwork of singles and filler, but as an album that works as a monolithic entirety. <br /> <br />Interpol's emergence was accompanied by a hyperactive avalanche of acclaim and publicity so that, once the hype began to subside, a backlash was just about inevitable. It's such a shame when the hormonal music press stirs up an unsustainable buzz in whose wake a similarly disproportionate sceptism almost always sets in. For the record, Interpol are not rock's messianic saviours. Neither are they a band whose suits are more important than their guitars. What Interpol do is simple: they wed style and subtance, vision and expression, and in 'Turn on the Bright Lights', they have created a compelling and compulsive debut. Taking a step back from all the provisional journalistic PR is helpful because it helps one realise that, believe it or not, Interpol are actually what people were claiming all along: a good band.
B000002MP2|5.0|i got this as my first green day cd and is on top along with insomniac and nimrod and every song is wonderful. i remember i got this when i was 10 and i repeated it on my stereo in my room and sorta hopped around singing the lyrics (...)    i was gonna list the best songs but why waste space writing every song on the cd. if u like the new green day then go die somewhere. but if u just want a new punk cd get this baby (...)
B000A7DVR2|5.0|I already own the regular R2 version with no extras so when I found out that there would be a Collector's Edition I was thrilled. This is one of the best and funniest movies I have seen. Then I look at the extras. No commentary! Why doesn't it have a commentary trak? I won't buy it. Plus I think they could have done a better job with the cover. This one really sucks. <br />But fantastic movie 10 out of 10.
B000002N2P|5.0|this is probably the best green day cd in my opinion. billie joe wrote it when he had his first kid and was tired the whole time so it has alot of darker lyrics but thats cool. i love green day. (whyd radio green day listeners ruin my fun?)    go buy this one unless ur one of those kids who bought the new american idiot cd to be cool HAHAHAH
B000001FV1|5.0|I dont know what to say bout this album. Apart from Jazz music I am too much hooked with music of Traffic for quite a long time. A long time back I have heard Low spark and high heeled boys and can't even forget the tune. But this album is something which has really surpussed \\"Low Spar....\\". Every Friday evening I chill out in night with Roll Right Stones which has become a mantra to me. The expression of Steve Windwood is something very delicate which once heard can't be erased from mind....

B00005Y6YB|5.0|I just want to add mine to the rest of the favorable reviews for this DVD.  The story is absolutely beautiful as is the writing.  The characterization is great and Duvall's acting is superb.  What an artisan !  The only complaints I have are that the film is too grainy at times causing the transfer to suffer and the original special effects are just not good.  But these factors would not cause me to give it less than five stars because the movie is just so darn good.  Make time and watch this one.
B00005J6UP|3.0|The movie is really cute, but the language was very unexpected for PG rating. I had seen this movie back in the 80's and thought it was really funny, but guess that was before I watched it with kids! The children in the movie are the ones that use the inappropriate words, not really want I wanted my kids hearing. This will not be a movie that I keep on the shelf for them to have access to. I recommend renting before buying if you can find it.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|I went and saw this movie with high expectations because of all the hype and I have to say that I was NOT dissapointed.  It held it's own as the best batman movie to date.  Christian Bale was the PERFECT batman, well, moreso the PERFECT Bruce Wayne and that is precisly the point of the movie.  This movie is more about Brce Wayne than batman and that is half the reason why my kid brother wasn't as impressed.  The action is reserved for the end, the guts of the movie is more Bruce growing up, realizing his destiny and coming to grips with the murder of his parents.  Besides Bale Cillian Murphy and Liam Neison do AMAZING jobs with what little screen time they are allotted and Katie Holmes, while not spectacular is still sweet and charming.  The storyline is great, the plot is worthy of the title and this movie hopfully will catapult with an amazing series of SERIOUS and DARK movies that do the batman justice, the way he was always meant to be portrayed.
B000B5XOY8|5.0|Acclaimed filmmaker Tim Burton brings the legendary caped crime-fighter to the big screen in the spectacular 1989 blockbuster \\"Batman\\". In the dark streets of Gotham City, an urban myth known as \\"the Batman\\" (Michael Keaton) uses the night to strike fear in the hearts of criminals. When the city is threatened by the psychotic criminal known as the Joker (Jack Nicholson), the mysterious Batman becomes the city's only hope. \\"Batman\\" is an outstanding action-packed spectacle that honors Bob Kane's popular creation. Director Tim Burton's unique style gives the story much emotion and depth. Michael Keaton gives a fine performance as Batman/Bruce Wayne and Jack Nicholson is terrific as the Joker. The movie also contains some nice visuals, impressive action, great humor, cool gadgets and a rich music score. The cast also includes Kim Basinger, Robert Wuhl, Michael Gough, Billy Dee Williams and Jack Palance. This comic book film became the runaway smash hit in 1989 and launched a multimillion dollar franchise.<br /><br />For fans whom been waiting years for a special edition release, \\"Batman\\" Special Edition really delivers. The 1989 blockbuster is presented in its original 1.78:1 theatrical widescreen format. The DVD contains a truly vibrant picture quality and an intense 5.1 Dolby Digital sound. Its supplemental extras include a detailed audio commentary by director Tim Burton, the comprehensive 40-minute \\"Legends of the Dark Knight\\" documentary, several behind-the-scenes featurettes, \\"Heroes & Villains\\" galleries, theatrical trailers and three music videos by Prince. With such new bonus features, \\"Batman: Special Edition\\" obtains an \\"A\\".

B000PC6A3E|5.0|Director Christopher Nolan (Memento & Insomnia) and star Christian Bale (The Machinist) resurrect the popular caped crusader in the remarkable summer blockbuster \\"Batman Begins\\". After the tragic loss of his parents, young Bruce Wayne (Bale) travels the world to understand the criminal underworld and learns the means to fight injustice. With a striking new disguise and some high-tech gadgets, his dark alter-ego Batman begins his quest to protect Gotham City from crime and corruption. \\"Batman Begins\\" is one of the finest comic book adaptations to hit the big screen. The movie avoids the colorful silliness and the bland one-liners that deteriorated the \\"Batman\\" franchise. This impressive comic book movie contains a well structured and engrossing plot, solid emotional depth, dazzling action sequences and fine performances. Christian Bale is certainly engaging as the emotionally tortured Bruce Wayne. The all-star cast also includes Liam Neeson, Michael Cane, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Ken Wantanabe and Morgan Freeman.<br /><br />If you already purchased \\"Batman Begins\\" on HD DVD then you might be disappointed that Blu-Ray holds no big surprises. \\"Batman Begins\\" is presented in its theatrical 2.40:1 widescreen format. The picture quality is the same as the previous HD DVD release but is still an excellent transfer. Its 5.1 Dolby TrueHD Dolby sound offers a great home theater experience. The special features are the same as in the previous 2-disc DVD and HD DVD versions. They include eight short behind-the-scenes featurettes that deeply explore the making of the 2005 blockbuster, a few picture galleries and its theatrical trailer. \\"Tankman Begins\\" is a funny spoof of the film that was broadcasted during the 2005 MTV Movie Awards. With such terrific presentation and worthy extras, \\"Batman Begins\\" gets a solid \\"A\\".
0142001104|5.0|This is not another book simply suggesting calling a glass of water half-full instead of half-empty. Instead, it suggests a different view at the reality stating that we are living within our own limited frameworks carefully built since our childhood and basing on grades given by others or - later - by ourselves.<br /><br />As the conductor of the Orchestra, Benjamin Zander had a chance to free Musicians of appraisals bondages and prove the fact that when a human being does not see fake limits imposed by the education, society, by himself or herself, he or she can make miracles, achieving wonderful results and succeeding to pass transcendentally his or her true feelings to other people. The authors propose to make one's life full of possibilities and give practical techniques on how to make it possible.<br /><br />The book is written so that the impression of a long waving line of narration without gaps or inconsistencies accompanies the reader.

B00006JQU1|5.0|I have many different versions of Bach's Sonatas and Partitas for solo violin, but I must say this is the best one I have heard.  Rachel Podger's violin has a richer tone not found in most contemporary violins, and her interpretation of the music is quite original.  The way she plays makes it seem almost effortless without sounding too lackadaisical.  She has a kind of flow that is enlightening as well as dramatic.  In my opinion, this is the best rendition of Bach's famous solo violin works.
B000056VJ7|5.0|In 1977, I remember seeing an album called \\"Bat Out of Hell\\" by an artist named Meat Loaf.   My first reaction would be Meat Loaf???    I As I got older, I soon realized that this would soon become one of the legendary albums of all-time.  <br /> <br />The reason why \\"Bat Out of Hell\\" is such a great album is because it really is a triple-headed monster - Jim Steinman, Meat Loaf, and Todd Rundgren.   Many people know that the songs on \\"Bat Out of Hell\\" were written by Jim Steinman.   For all practical purposes, \\"Bat Out of Hell\\" marked the breakthrough album for Steinman.   It was Steinman's innovative songwriting that many people think give \\"Bat Out of Hell\\" its edge.   For the most part, Steinman assembles a product that is for all practical purposes a Rock Opera (this is now called Wagnerian Rock).   The concept seems to revolve around the thoughts of an a teenage/young adult male.    \\"Bat Out of Hell\\"'s signature song \\"Paradise By the Dashboard Light\\" really epitomizes the Rock Opera theme - especially during the part when \\"Boy\\" and \\"Girl\\" trade vocals in a musical dialogue which is considered to be true songwriting genius. <br /> <br />Steinman recognized he couldn't do it alone.    While Steinman would provide the innovative songwriting, he needed a vocalist to pull this off.   And he would need a special vocalist to do this.    Steinman would find that special vocalist in Marvin Lee Aday - most commonly know as Meat Loaf.  When I look at pure vocalists today, I have to put Meat Loaf at the top of that list.    Not only does he have powerful vocals, but he delivers a passion that really makes his singing special. This might come from some of Meat's theatrical experience (i.e. \\"Rocky Horror Picture Show\\").   It is this passion that really makes carrying out the music that Steinman wrote work so perfectly.  By his own admission, Meat is not a songwriter.   Steinman and Meat would realize early on that they had a special combination when they started working together.   Meat isn't just a hired hand in this case.   While Steinman may be the author of the songs, Meat had significant input into the concepts of this album - and no doubt Steinman was able to translate this input into lyrics. <br /> <br />The third part of the Triple Headed Monster is Todd Rundgren.   Rumor is that when Meat and Steinman were in the process of trying to get record company to take the concept of their album, they had much difficulty.   Word is that guitarist Todd Rundgren heard it and decided to take the role as producer.   Todd Rundgren is truly one of the most underrated names in the music industry.   It was his leadership that really helped put Steinman and Meat's concept into reality.    One way that Rundgren succeeded in doing this was by bringing him some top musicians to work along side the team.    While Steinman would work keyboards and Rundgren would provide guitar work, Rundgren clearly recognized that a lot more was needed.     Two big names that were brought to work in to work as studio musicians came from Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band - pianist Roy Bittan and Drummer Max Weinberg.  Bittan contributes his work to all seven of the tracks on this collection.  Weinberg plays Drums on three tracks.   These top-notch musicians  help to carry out some of the most terrific music on this Rock Opera.  I'm sure it was Rundgren who would recognize what a special voice he had in Ellen Foley - who would become most famous for singing the part of \\"Girl\\" on \\"Paradise By the Dashboard Light\\". <br /> <br />With five of the seven tracks over 5 minutes long and three of these tracks over 8 minutes long, this wasn't an album that was going to be heard a lot on Top 40 radio.   However, it would be the Album-Oriented Rock Circuit and in general \\"word of mouth\\" that would garner this album popularity and help turn it into one of the greatest selling albums of all-time. <br /> <br />A Brief Synopsis of the songs: <br />\\"Bat Out of Hell\\": Longest track ofthe album.  Terrific mix of keyboards and guitar.   The song reminds me of something The Who would do (who embraced the Rock Opera style).  You can also hear the trademark Roy Bittan sound.   Meat actually doesn't start singing until about 2 minutes into the song.   Meat delivers the vocals in a theatrical style and giving the song an added dimension. <br /> <br />\\"You Took the Words Right Out of My Mouth (Hot Summer Nights)\\": The spoken dialogue at the beginning gives this song a Rock Opera feel.  The song breaks into a trademark Roy Bittan led Piano melody.  Meat's vocals once again come through with passion.  Terrific background vocals that feature Foley and Rundgren help out. <br /> <br />\\"Heaven Can Wait\\": This is a softer ballad that often gets overlooked.    Meat proves he can do the softer stuff as well as the harder stuff. <br /> <br />\\"All Revved Up With No Place To Go\\": This song brings in the use of a saxophone.  Steinman and Rundgren do a great job at letting the saxophone be the \\"driving instrument\\".    Rundgren's guitar combined and Bittan's piano are on form.  Ellen Foley also provides background vocals. <br /> <br />\\"Two Out of Three Ain't Bad\\": A short enough song that it got mainstream airplay.  Meat's vocals are the story here - a simply legendary song. <br /> <br />\\"Paradise By the Dashboard Light\\": As mentioned the album's signature song - and probably Meat's signature song.   This song is almost a Rock Opera in itself - especially Meat and Foley's musical dialog at the end. <br /> <br />\\"For Crying Out Loud\\": Another underrated track.  This song has that bombastic \\"Rock Opera Finale\\" type of quality to it that make it the perfect wrap-up song. <br /> <br />Overall, this is truly one of the great albums of all-time.  Meat Loaf and Steinman always prove they are at their best when they work together.  This album proves it -  a must have.
B0009XT8YW|5.0|Unfortunately, they pretty much let anyone write reviews on Amazon, even those people who have no idea of what they are talking about or feel the sad need to vent...<br /><br />So to \\"Mr. Peron\\"... maybe you should get your facts straight... your comment is listed on \\"Guilty\\" when it clearly should have been posted on \\"Guilty Pleasures\\" (pathetic attempt at a review that it is)... and clearly you are out of step with current successful movies or you would know that Barbra Streisand starred in last years \\"Meet the Fockers\\" which has become the highest grossing live action comedy of all time. So much for needing to \\"revive\\" her film career.<br /><br />Get a life.
B0000640SA|5.0|From my title...you can tell i love this movie. I like a lot of psychological thrillers/horrors. Same with comedys...anyway. <br />This movie redefines  psychological thriller. It makes you think. Leonard is a man with a short term memory disorder. Not to bad right? So what? He can still live. He remembers things from  before the \\"accident\\". Right? Well....not really. Since he has short term memory he can't remember things for at least 5 mins. before he forgets what just happened. Without giving to much of this great and sometimes confusing story, i will now tell some of it. Because of his condition he can't remember things *you know this already....* but he now wants to find his wifes killer. When the \\"accident\\" happened. His wife was killed in the accident that made him get short term memory. He now is seeking vengence. To remember things he  stays organized and keeps notes. He even had some of them on hid bodhy, as tattos.  He is seeking a guy named John G., his friend Teddy is helping him find her. Along the way Leonard runs into a woman, Natalie, who helps him out of pity. What is most amazing about this story is 1) the way it is presented, they start from the end and work to the begginging. No movie has done that before, and this movie has done it very well. 2) All the ways people translate what happens, many people translate the endding *or should i say...begginging* differently, which makes this movie a very interesting discussion. It drives deep into the human pshyic, and shows  us things we simply cannot accept.  An amazing movie, with some of the best acting I have ever seen. You have not lived, or seen a good movie till you see this. What i think is sad is that Guy Preace was never recognized for this performace. Because it is so well done. I'm about one of the only people in  my town *very big town....*...or in my state probably that has ever even seen or heard of this wonderful movie. You must go out and buy this movie now, if you don't you will trulybe sorry you didn't. It gives you a wonderful experience that you've never seen before. Give this  not very well known movie a chance, you will not be dissappointed
B0006B29Z2|5.0|The quality is certainly good on this one. Everything from the old concerts to the interviews is just nicely done. The interview where Harris remembers the mid-70s and how Maiden got to be is really cool. You can check other reviews for details about what's included, I'll only tell you my overall satisfaction about the product. I'm a big Maiden fan and this package is a blessing, since it not only has arguably the most important Maiden interview ever, but also all their videos, TV appearances, live concerts and Derek Riggs' drawings. If you are a Maiden fan there is no question about whether you should own this or not.
0743200748|4.0|Ambrose normally gives much detail to popular history when he writes, but this book was a very different approach. Some historic details were given, most of which can be found in his other books. The thing that was different about this one was the brief glimpse of Ambrose's personal life. We heard much of his relationships with other men. These are manly relationships, the kind we all need. It dealt with his two brothers and how they were close as well as some of his best friends through life. The most inspirational was the chapter that told of his relationship to his father. I wasn't deeply moved or anything, but I did appreciate the personal side of Ambrose. You will enjoy this written picture of proper male bonding. <br />
B000AU9UYM|5.0|This movie doesn't just raise the benchmark for comic to big screen translations, it reestablishes the more subtle and realistic style of action flick. Gone are the gross absurdities of the Matrix and cartoonish violence of Kill Bill, and in their place is an action flick fit to compete with the best of the James Bond movies. It's well written, directed deftly and manages to be both true to the essence of Batman and a worthy movie unto itself.
B000AM4PBS|5.0|Looking at the beautiful boxed set makes me want to cry. Being an avid fan of Friends, I have been buying each season's boxed set since the first season DVDs came out. Back then, Seasons 1 and 2 cost more than 50US$ each.  <br /> <br />Now, they have all ten seasons in a very nice packaging at 21US$ per season! I can't help but feel cheated.
B000AL730O|5.0|I'm a 17-year-old L.A. girl who absolutely adores the Beatles.  Can't get enough of them, even as my classmates listen to 50 Cent.  I even love the Beatles' solo music, but Paul has always been my favorite.  I'd be lying if I said I was in love with every solo song he ever wrote, but I do love nearly all of the ones I've heard, whether it was from McCartney, Ram, Band on the Run, Tug of War, Flowers in the Dirt, Flaming Pie, or Driving Rain.  Every album of his is so different from the others, I love that he's constantly experimenting and creating fresh new music.  Which is why I shouldn't have been surprised to discover that Chaos and Creation in the Backyard is one of his best albums yet.  But wow.  This is a great album, and while I may have some big favorites and some lesser favorites, there's not a single song that makes me cringe or look frantically for the \\"skip song\\" button.  I'm not going to try to describe the beauty of each song, or to compare each one to some prior Paul song.  I'm going to say that this is truly one of Paul McCartney's best albums, and the fact that he released it at the age of 63 makes me giddy to think of the boundless untapped creativity he still has.  I would whole-heartedly recommend this album, for people young and old, Beatles fans and Paul fans, and especially fans of good music.
B00097A5HW|5.0|The best artists always make us wait a while for their latest and Shakira was no exception after her 2001 english debut. Now, 4 years later she returns with her first full Spanish album since 1999's \\"Donde Estan Los Ladrones?\\" which features the exhilarating Morroccan-tinged hit \\"Ojos Asi.\\" Now comes \\"Fijacion Oral Vol. 1,\\" the first of a two-part album project (part 2, an all English CD, comes out later this year), which is proof that she is getting better with age and experience. There are no weak songs here, and the songs that are the weaker half of the album are still better than most of the recent new releases by Latin artists or American ones for that matter. This is a work of rich melodies and beautiful words, phrases and thoughts. There is almost a weird connection between Shakira and Patti Smith in the way their words are almost literary in that modern Punk style. Of course Shakira is less rough than Smith and more akin to Alanis Morrissette. There is a deep personal feeling here, it helps that Shakira writes the bulk of her material which shines with in-depth probing into her thoughts on romance, the world, death, tragedy etc. \\"No\\" is an intoxicating ballad with dreamy acoustic guitars and visions of heartbreak and poison while \\"La Tortura\\" is a sexy, sultry break-up tune with sounds and rhythms from Shakira's native Colombia, especially the coastal areas, guest singer Alejandro Sanz provides a great secondary vocal with his rough Spanish voice. Some songs have a fun almost New Wave feel like \\"Las De La Intuicion.\\" \\"Escondite Ingles\\" displays Shakira's love for rock n' roll and \\"En Tus Pupiles\\" is full of memorable images, almost cinematic. For this album Shakira is produced by Rick Rubin, the man behind the scenes for other artists like Audioslave and the late Johnny Cash. Here Rubin helps Shakira find a defined, sharp sound that keeps her original roots but pumps up the volume and shows off more style and studio technique. There are moments like \\"La Imprescindible\\" where Shakira sounds more dangerous and edgy, and more mature. \\"Donde Estan Los Ladrones\\" established her even more firmly in Latin America, Americans were frankly catching up when she hit our shores, but with albums like \\"Fijacion Oral\\" Shakira proves she still has what it takes to stay on top, in any language.
B0009X766Y|3.0|If this is the first of Universal's \\"Legacy Collection,\\" they should be ashamed of themselves.  First, it took this long to get the widescreen edition out, and second, at this price, there should be a commentary and booklet, not just recycled interviews. <br /> <br />There is SO much to say to today's viewers about this wonderful film, it's a shame Universal missed the boat badly on this on.  Thanks for the Widescreen at last, but that's it.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is a great political statement for our times from the disinfranchised voice of Billie Joe Armstrong and the others Green Day members.  Before I always felt that Green Day has been nice with their pop punk guitar hooks, but nothing special until now.  With this album they have matured and our unafraid to let their politics shine.  This is the best album I've bought in years.
0805053883|2.0|This is cute- but, it's not as good as Brown Bear. <br />The words don't just roll off your tongue like Brown Bear. <br />I don't find it as \\"catchy\\". <br />
B00005QY5Y|5.0|This album is a great eclectic mix of old time stonesy rock'n'roll.  Hardly a miss on any of the tracks.
B0009KA7BS|3.0|I enjoyed the movie very much.  However, what was up with the sound quality.  I had to turn up my volume in order to hear them speak.  The music was loud and the vocals were very low.  Some one should check these movies before they go out to the public.  A movie is no good without sound! I watched the whole movie with the subtitles on.  In case your wondering, I have surround sound so I played with different settings to see if I could improve the quality -- didn't work!  I wonder if anyone else experienced this, or if I just got a bad copy! <br /> <br />
B00005LC1H|5.0|Great series.  John Cleese has once again made me laugh so hard!
B0001GOH6Q|1.0|Tim Burton, what has happened to you. Batman, Edward Scissorhands, and other great movies. Then things went downhill with Planet of the Apes and just snowballed into an avalanche from there. This had to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Was the movie full of lush visual effects like all Tim Burton movies-yes. Did the movie have a ridiculous plot and terrible acting-absolutely. I love Ewan McGreggor but this was just a sad movie that wandered here and there with no purpose.  <br /> <br />I do not know the main characters names, but a guy played by Daddy Warbucks is about to die and recalls his life to his family. Now Daddy Warbucks doesn't tell stories like a normal person, he likes to embellish the stories, so you get these ridiculous sequences throughout the movie of flashbacks to when he was a child (in this case played by Obi-Wan Kenobi). Of course, Billy Crudup, playing Daddy Warbucks child, is still bitter at his father for embarrassing him for all these years and always taking the spotlight, even at his own wedding!  <br /> <br />Unfortunately for me, someone failed to tell me the truth and told me to see this garbage and my wife and I ended up wasting $15 combined to see it.  <br /> <br />I will give them props for casting people who look exactly alike Jessica Lange and Alison Lohman, but other than that, save your time and watch something better like Ishtar or Waterworld.
B00005JOHU|2.0|MOVIE: Ever wonder what reading a script is like? Well, with Lord Of War it becomes a first hand experience.  Lord Of War is a film about a guy who is one of the hottest arms dealers around. Yuri (Cage) tries to find his calling in life, and he stumbles into international arms dealing.  What the entire movie basically talks about is if it's moral, and when I say \\"talk\\" I do mean it.  The entire movie is narrated by Nic Cage's character, every thought and every action. Each scene is layed out by narration and then wrapped up with narration. It gets to a point where you feel like yelling at the writer and tell him \\"to shut that goddamn inner monologue off\\". What seperates a film from a book is that the action is performed in a film rather than described. People call this film an \\"action/adventure\\", but I find no justification for this to be placed in that genre. The only thing this movie has going for it is that there are some interesting ideas being thrown around. Unfortunetly all those ideas don't make an impact because the audience becomes so bored with the film. In terms of cinematic achievments, there are a few well done scenes.  A scene involving Nicolas Cage and Ian Holm was pretty tense, and so is a scene that shows Nicolas Cage going through some hallucinations. The opening credits were  brilliant in my opinion, but then again I couldn't wait to see the closing credits.  The relationship between Cage and his wife was also pretty bad. Basically she married Yuri for the money, and then she gets angry with him when she finds out what he actually does and that he had been decieving her. Talk about true love. The movie never finds its direction, and that makes the audience suffer for two hours. It had some nifty camera work and cinematography, but the satirical points the movie was trying to make was lost due to poor pacing and no direction within the plot.<br /><br />ACTING: Nothing stellar, we've all seen what these actors can do and they don't do much more than that here.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Not very enjoyable, you may get a chuckle or a smile from a witty line a few times throughout, but all the 3rd person narration will bore you to tears.an that here. <br /> <br />BOTTOM LINE: Not very enjoyable, you may get a chuckle or a smile from a witty line a few times throughout, but all the 3rd person narration will bore you to tears.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|i can believe that there are reviews that blast this album. this album is amazing. the drums, guitar, everything. the only thing i would change is some of the \\"noise\\" fades between tracks. but overall, this album is amazing. the musicianship and production rival anything good out there. to all those who didn't like this album, maybe you should listen to it again. maybe you weren't paying attention or just don't know what good music is. this is it. it can hardly get better than this. the disjointed track to song relationship may bother new fans, but it does help to change perception of how a song should be listened to. i love it. if you don't, i feel sorry for you.
0895260131|3.0|A brave book, given the tenor of our times. For a serious student of Middle East conflicts, the book is a bit simplistic, and would benefit from a greater appreciation of forces impacting the Islamic world since the beginning of this century.<br /><br />Not all of Islam's woes are attributable to following the literal dictates of the Q'uran. The author relies a bit too much on exposing the often horrorific implementation of Muslim law, or Sharia.<br /><br />Not a bad introduction to the topic, particularly those with right wing views. But to get a wider appreciation of this pressing problem, be sure to read other books, too, such as The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict (2nd Edition).
0060989157|5.0|This book is extraordinary because it comes straight from the mouths of the men who experienced it. You laugh, you gasp, and find yourself wanting to pull them out of their downward spirals even though they're rock stars that can have anything, and did, minus some much needed self-discipline. I carried this book everywhere so if I had the chance, I could open it and fall back into their world. Being a Cr&uuml;e fan made me love this book and being a cautious and music obsessed 21 yr-old made me secretly want to join them. Whether you're a fan or not, this is a GREAT and unique read...<br /><br />!WARNING: NOT FOR THE PRUDISH OR CLOSE-MINDED!
B000ASATWQ|5.0|Well, the master has come back! This is an exceptional return to recording for Damian \\"Junior Gong\\" Marley. There is a message in all the tracks that shows how much the artist has grown and how much aware he is of what is going on in his society and the world. The combinations with Nas, Bobby Brown, and his older brother Stephen Marley are also real delights for any music lover. Personally, my favorite tracks are: There For You; Welcome to Jamrock; The Master Has Come Back; For the Babies; Road to Zion; Hey Girl; and We're Gonna Make It.
B00005NEUF|5.0|the cover of this album rules, that's all that needs to be said. The Strokes are great, sure, but man, that artwork...yummy.:D:D oh and to all the people who voted my review as not helpful, go find something else to do with your lives losers.
0671006932|5.0|John Steinbeck, in his novel Of Mice and Men, immediately floods the reader's mind with an image of the Salinas Valley in California, back in the summer of 1937. A hot summer afternoon introduces characters Lennie and George, two migrant workers looking to accomplish their dreams. They come to learn to recognize their differences and the beginning of a new friendship in their quest for work and happiness. <br /> <br />George Milton, the smarter and more realistic of the two, is described as \\"small and quick and dark in the face\\" whereas Lennie Small, who is in the least bit small, is mentally inadequate, and is physically described as being almost bear-like. The image Steinbeck creates of the two friends is almost comical, because throughout the book you can imagine a witty little man and a large, hairy guy that resembles a beast. Lennie's actions are always compared to those of animals, which play an important role in novel's end. <br /> <br />The story begins when the duo flees from Weed, a city in California, to the Salinas Valley and they find work as farmhands on a ranch. At first, the boss of the ranch is hesitant in hiring Lennie because he isn't very talkative, but George convinces him that Lennie is \\"...sure a hell of a good worker. Strong as a bull.\\" Sure enough, they get the job. <br /> <br />As I said, the setting of the novel falls into the time period of the Great Depression. Lennie and George, like most migrant workers back in the Depression, don't have families and live day to day on the food they have and the money they make, often promising themselves to remind each other of their goal: owning a ranch of their own one day, where they could be a family. George would be his own boss and Lennie could raise his very own rabbits.  <br /> <br />At the ranch, George and Lennie meet lots of new friends and other farmhands. The characters they meet all have dreams of their own. For instance, Crooks, a \\"negro\\" stable-hand is much discriminated against by theother workers. He dreams of being able to be accepted and to feel like he belongs. They also have to deal with Curley, the spoiled and ruthless son of the boss, who always corners Lennie. <br /> <br />Throughout the book, George must control, or rather attempt to control, Lennie's animal-like characteristics. He promises Lennie to always take care of him. However, when Lennie's animal characteristics take over and something happens to Curley's girlfriend, things get hectic and George must make a decision that will affect the rest of his life... <br /> <br />And this is why you have to read the book. <br /> <br />The book is unlike any book I've ever picked up before. Throughout the entire novel, the quality of Lennie and George's friendship is challenged, but it only ever strengthens. John Steinbeck is a literary genius, and his development of such a wonderful friendship between two fictional characters keeps the reader hooked from beginning to end.  <br />

B000B5XZLU|5.0|I AGREE W/THE REVIEWER FROM NY, THIS CD IS THEIR BEST WORK YET...IF I HAD TO CHOOSE A FAVORITE TRACK, I WOULD SAY ALL OF THEM.  CAN'T PUT THIS CD DOWN.  I'VE BEEN A TRUE FAN FROM THE BEGINNING AND THIS LAST ONE WAS WELL WORTH THE 4 YEAR WAIT.  AS FOR THE CHICAGO FANS...JAMIROQUAI IS GOING TO BE AT THE CONGRESS THEATER ON OCT. 30TH. I BOUGHT MY TICKETS THE DAY THEY WENT ON SALE.  LOVE THIS CD...
B00000JNOJ|5.0|As the other reviewers have already clearly said, this is one of the 25? 10? 5? 3? greatest Albums of all time. I never tire of hearing it and the extension tracksa are nicely chosen. If you like the blues just a little, you'll be happy you bought this.<br /><br />But it is not only a great album of the unique Muddy Waters, it is at the same time a wonderful example of acoustic guitar playing by Buddy Guy, and Dixon's basswork is also impeccable. If everything falls into place, you get a classic like this.
B0009W5K0Y|4.0|All We Know Is Falling is a great album to purchase. Hayley Williams has a magnificent voice, especially for a 16-year-old. However, her voice isn't for everyone, because I know that I myself can get tired of her voice at times.  <br /> <br />Some critics remark that Williams' vocals sound like pop solo artist Avril Lavigne except with a punk band. Paramore is no where near punk if one compares the band to punk legends such as Rancid, Bad Religion, and Operation Ivy. Paramore's label would be indie rock or rock alternative. Also, Lavigne's voice doesn't even compare to the great timbre and quality of Williams' vocal chords. This frontwoman succeeds at sustaining notes for long periods of time, which she seizes a myriad of times on All We Know Is Falling, especially \\"Conspiracy.\\" <br /> <br />Lasting only around 35 minutes, all ten songs on this album are as eclectic as youth and freshness can get without stepping too outside their box's genre. For example, track seven, entitled \\"Whoa,\\" has very mellow and soft verses while its choruses are upbeat. The exact opposite occurs in \\"Here We Go Again,\\" which is probably deemed as the poppiest song on the entire record. The transition between each slow and fast part lies solely in the hands of Paramore's drummer, 15-year-old Zach Farro, and he does it well. Another way this Tennessee band proves they are different from other bands is by getting guitarists Jason Bynum and Josh Farro, Zack's brother, to sing back up to Williams in the last two tracks of All We Know Is Falling, \\"Franklin\\" and \\"My Heart.\\" In \\"My Heart,\\" Paramore proves how they can also record a decent screamo song. <br /> <br />Most of Paramore's lyrics aren't a Godsend or anything, but they are above average. \\"Never Let This Go\\" has such amazing lyrics that I used transfer paper to iron-on the opening line on a tee shirt. However, \\"Whoa\\" and \\"Here We Go Again\\" have a poppy, childish feel that I can see myself getting tired of soon because of its repetition ofunmoving lyrics. <br /> <br />\\"Pressure\\" and \\"All You Need are one of the more major reasons to listen to this album. \\"Pressure\\" is as addicting as a coffee lover's addiction to their favorite mug; its powerful choruses can make a person want to listen to the song on repeat. \\"All You Need\\" has beautiful guitar riffs and outstanding vocals. <br /> <br />All We Know Is Falling has an indie/rock feel with just an inkling of pop. Despite their high school ages, Paramore proves that these far from mediocre teenagers can indeed make a successful record.
B000AA305M|4.0|<br /> I pretty much picked up this album on a whim.  I first got into DG through White Ladder.  After that, I pretty much lost interest in his music.  Thanks to this new album, the Love Affair is back! While he isn't for everyone, I think he is Amazing!  And this album definitely proves it.  It was definitely worth the wait.  I won't go through all of my favs, but I will say, if you didn't like it after first listen, give it another chance!  Its definitely a grower!  I NEVER expected this CD to work with iTunes/iPod, with all the frustration I had with other albums with this new Technology (Foo Fighters, Dave Matthews Band) I think it's totally unfair that it will only work with Windows Media Player.  I looked at the Single Disc version of \\"Life in Slow Motion\\" and immediately noticed that it was only compatible with Windows.  I assumed the same went for the DualDisc.  But I was wrong!  I stuck it in the computer, copied 1 Track, and figured it was going to keep skipping like the others.  IT WORKS!  I'm soo Happy!  I dunno if this is just a Fluke, or if thats the way DualDiscs are made?  If they all work like this, I'll be sure to pick up DualDiscs from now on!
B000002H33|5.0|I like every song on the album. <br />I never buy an album if I only like 2 or 3 songs on it. <br />There is not a single sucky song on this one.
6304119046|5.0|Sure, the polls are interesting...but the film itself will always be far more so.  Watch it alongside run-of-the-mill pictures from the late 30s/early 40s and the reasons why it's such a watershed become quite apparent.  I don't think anything that's appeared since matches it in this respect, and among earlier films only Birth of a Nation (which is repugnant to enlightened taste in so many ways) and Potemkin (which is brilliant but rhetorical and polemical) are in the same league.  Like, say, Kind of Blue or Beethoven's 9th or War and Peace, Kane has to suffer the heavy burden of being the traditional poll-topping \\"#1,\\" which makes it a target for people of any level of ignorance; but no one with a serious appreciation of film history can deny the greatness of this picture, especially given how well it holds up to repeated viewings.
B00006JQU1|5.0|Rachel Podger has become one of the top artists of the Baroque violin and - like most of the great violin masters past and present - faces one of Baroque music's most challenging tests in these solo masterpieces of Bach.  Musical technique aside, Podger's solo works here stand out from others for their smooth, warm, upbeat tones and most impressive intonation - but perhaps less for its sheer panache (as heard in her red-hot Vivaldi 'la Strav.'concertos).      Part of her beautiful tone must be due to 1739 Persarinius she used in addition to the pristine and vivid, all-digital recording Channel recording.  But, where other performers emphasize the deeper, edgy emotive qualities of these intricate works, Podger takes a most pleasant, sunny line that with a smoother, less 'edgy' tonal quality.  She presents a most human side of these works with an intonation that borders on perfection along with a fluidity and ease that commands admiration.  If you prefer a strict Baroque 'astingent' sound, it will not be found here.    But not all 'warm' to Podger's purely warm tone here.  Reviews from the music press were quiet divided, ranging from top accolades from Gramophone (and Gramophone highest 'Gem' Award) to outright dissing reviews from ClassicsToday that gave Vol. 1 an insultingly low 2/10 rating for \\"Artistic Quality.\\"  As other reviewers note, Ms. Podger's readings here have a more 'relaxed virtuosity' and are thus less overtly dynamic as compared to recordings by say, Perlman, Kremer or Grumiaux.  To me, Podger's readings here stands out for their approachability.  She tames these rather daunting, scholarly classics and translates them with great humanity.  Milstein's classic readings should also be noted for their impeccable tone, technical ease, fluidity and artistic beauty.    In these pieces, Ms. Podger's greatest strengths lie in the bright, major-key works which exude a wonderful, extraverted and carefree joy (BWV1006 preludio or the BWV1005 allegro).  She reallybrings out a vivid glow and effervencent dance rythym in such movements that can elevate the cloudiest spirit.  Similarly, her crisp articulations and bowing in the marvelous A-minor allegro is both powerful and silky-smooth in its \\"echo\\" effects.  She truly finds the joyful, sunny side of these works, which most should find delightful and most appealing.      However, the situation is a bit different in the pathos-imbued, minor-key works.  In these compared to others, Ms. Podger still retains a warmer tone and does not quite emphasize the darker recesses of the compositions.  An example is her reading of the famous D minor chaconne that is relatively mild-mannered (some even say dull and lacking) compared to other's readings in terms of intensity and panache.  But, while some might see this as \\"short-changing\\" the music, I like the result for its overall refinement.  Some will like her more restrained style in such works - others will not.      These impressive discs add to the many current high-quality offerings in the catalog.  The sound quality is beautiful, full and vivid as any without being \\"reverbed out\\" like some.  If you can only get one volume to start, I would say Volume II is the one to get for its carefree and effervescent lyrical qualities in the major-key works.  Even if you have a favorite or two for these works, this exceptional musician is really worth hearing if you are not familiar with her Baroque specialties.   Compositions - 5 stars; Performance - 5 stars; Sound quality - 5 stars.

My husband, on the other hand, has always REALLY liked him.  I rented this dvd for my husband. <br />Ten minutes into the dvd, I was hooked.  Twenty minutes into the dvd, I got online and orderd one for us, one for my daughter in SF, and one for my 30 year old son.  WHAT A TREASURE!  I loved seeing the making of Dylan's career...I was intriqued with the passion he had for folk music, and the love and respect he had for all other music. Every note he heard was never wasted!  He is an amazing man with a fasinating career.  I am a Dylan fan now! <br />TRUST me ... this a dvd WORTH owning!!!
B000A0GP0Y|4.0|Remakes usually surface like the bubbles in a bathtub, with an expected reeking sensation.  However, this remake is rather amusing, even though it does not measure up with the original.  The cast is decent and the story amusing without much greatness to be pondered, which leaves the audience with an enjoyable cinematic experience that is worth a viewing and several laughs.<br /><br />In football, individuals put in hundreds of hours over the off-season in the weight room to get into ideal shape and the team polishes its plays to perfection through countless hours of preparation by coaches and players.  Despite all the preparations, one single mistake could break the whole situation, which could possibly result in a loss, or injury.  This in turn could have a downward spiraling affect on the team as a whole and affect the whole season.  Thus, when it happens, the coach is usually in the face of the player to make sure that it never happens again, as mistakes are what separate the winners from the losers.  This is why football is the ultimate team sport. In the testosterone pumped remake The Longest Yard, Paul Crewe (Adam Sandler) embodies the mistake of all mistakes in a football career, as he is sent to prison for the theft of his girlfriend's Bentley.<br /><br />Paul Crewe destroyed the valiant notion of hard work and dedication that surrounds football some years before the film takes place by shaving points in a football game for personal gain.  In disgrace, Crewe has withdrawn from public life while his girlfriend, played by Courteney Cox Arquette, flourishes in exposure.  This personal conflict between the two leads the drunken Crewe to steal her car, as she has it reported stolen.  The combination of alcohol, smart mouthing, and the car theft among other things lands Crewe a lengthy prison term in the Texas penal system.  Crewe ends up in Texas due to Warden Hazen (James Cromwell) who has pulled some strings to have Crewe sentenced in his prison, as he wants to win the Texas penitentiary league.<br /><br />When Crewe arrives to the prison, he quickly learns that both the guards and the inmates do not desire his presence.  This is also one of the reasons why he declines to help the Warden, as the guards are disgusted by his past in the professional league where he was appointed the most valuable player.  Immediately Crewe sets an example through which he acquires some respect, but it also means that he must help the warden.  He finds himself suggesting that the guards should play a tune-up game against some bad players, which gives Hazen the idea of a game between the guards and the inmates.<br /><br />At first, some inmates join up with Crewe, but there is a severe lack of talent among the prisoners and many of them are suspicious about Crewe.  Eventually, some talent emerges out of the secret hiding places and offers services to the team.  Many join the team to get a chance to repay the guards for years of humiliation and pain.  With the help of former Heisman winner Nate Scarborough (Burt Reynolds) and Caretaker (Chris Rock) Crewe has four weeks to prepare this rowdy bunch into a well-oiled Mean Machine that will be ready to stomp the guards.  However, it is not a painless journey for Crewe and company, as they face much adversity from within the prison while the heat begins to build up for a game that is beginning to gain national attention.<br /><br />Once again, Peter Segal partners up with Adam Sandler with whom he made Anger Management (2003) and 50 First Dates (2004), but it is not where Segal began his career directing comedies.  It is clear that Segal possess the skill of delivering decent comedies, yet much of the humor in the film is unoriginal and recognizable from other films.  Despite the formulaic approach, Segal succeeds in creating an entertaining concept that works and offers both humor and drama.  Some of the success might be due to that the film staying close to the original by Robert Aldrich from 1974 with Burt Reynolds.  Whatever it is in the film that makes it work, it ends up creating a story of trust, unity, and loyalty, which emerges in one of the least likely places in the world - prison.h from 1974 with Burt Reynolds.  Whatever it is in the film that makes it work, it ends up creating a story of trust, unity, and loyalty, which emerges in one of the least likely places in the world - prison.

B0002Z0EYK|3.0|I enjoyed watching this DVD for what it is: a Hollywood version of Ancient History (and also to see the hunks of Brad Pitt and Eric Banna). Although it was very romanticized, it still was an enjoyable flick. <br /> <br />I was expecting to see a little more realism in this modern version, but I think the producers want a ticket-guaranteed-formula of a romantic-heroic epic in the traditional sense. You have Brad Pitt in the nude with some chicks (blockbuster guaranteed), romantic drama (Paris and Helen and Achilles and his slave), and war scenes.  <br /> <br />What I don't understand is how they were afraid to portray Achilles as an homosexual if contemporary society is more open to homosexuality (and Hollywood seems to have been exploiting homosexuality nowadays). It is widely known that ancient Greek young men were expected to carry out homosexual relationships, and in this case, it makes sense that Achilles, who despised this war and its motives, would enter the battle only after going crazy for the death of his beloved Petroclus. I know that the relationship of Achilles and Petroclus is debatable. Some argue that this homosexual relationship was never stated in Homer's work. But I feel that it is important to the plot that Achilles loved Petroclus with deep intensity and that only his death would fill Achilles with immense rage to the point of craziness and would want to enter the war to avenge his lover. To portray Petroclus as an orphaned cousin of Achilles and that Achilles would protect him as a son is understandable too, but where does it say that Petroclus was indeed a cousin of Achilles? <br /> <br />Achilles was really disturbed by Petroclus' death, so much that when he killed Hector, he did not respect his corpse and carried him around Petroclus' tomb for 12 days. Only after Achilles' mother asked his son, he returned the body to the Trojans to receive a funeral. This would be further evidence of Achilles' deep love for Petroclus, yet, in this movie, they focus on Achilles' romantic relationship with the Trojan woman as if this was a major feature in the story. As I said, I like verism in a historic movie, but I guess I can understand the producers wanting Brad Pitt (Achilles) to be a true hero and a ladies man. <br /> <br />Also, despite the fact that Helen might have been a great part on the motive of this war, I think it was one of many other events that lead to war. Yeah, it's sounds romantic, but politically, really, it has to have more than that. It would have been nice to see a more accurate portrayal of ancient political affairs. <br /> <br />I enjoyed though how they did they Trojan horse. I couldn't picture a trojan horse with people in it before. The idea sounded so funny I just couldn't picture it. Good job on this. Also, I REALLY enjoyed watching Hector (played by Eric Banna). Besides being a hunk, great performance, acting, etc. he was to most likable hero to me, and too bad he died too soon in the movie. <br /> <br />Achilles, (Brad Pitt) was also accurately portrayed. It is said that Achilles was very arrogant and disrespectful of authority and although these are not likable traits, well, these were true of our beloved hero. <br /> <br />All in all, if you are looking into finding an enjoyable way to view history, to just have some sort of idea how the ancient times would look like and to enjoy a romantic and heroic fictional story I would recommend this film, but don't expect to be accurate to history or just to human nature.

That is still sadly my reaction.  I tried so hard to like this CD. But they've let me down. Upon over 20 listens this still doesn't grow on me. There are a few good songs. Overall though this album is the decline of Musical Growth and the beginning of contented mediocre nu-metal. Sorry SOAD, I haven't even bothered checking out Hypnotize yet.    So long and farewell...  Money and Fame has taken creativity hostage.    Favorite Songs: B.Y.O.B., Question, and Sad Statue.  -2 Stars (And that's being generous!)

The Music is incredible, like Dark Side of the Moon all over again. It is really nice, and the songs are just beautiful. The Pink Floyd sound is the same, just with no ausom Rodger Waters... But so what?! just becasue the Pink Floyd genious isn;t in this album doen;t mean you shouldn;t give it a chance! this is Pink Floyd's last album, and it really is sort of saying good bye, the songs are sort of speaking to you, (if you listen to it enough). In conclusion, this is an essential for a Pink Floyd collection no argument.

B0009NSE1K|4.0|Robot Hive: Exodus was simply another impulse buy for me after hearing \\"10001110101\\" on Sirius. Prior to this week, I knew only of Clutch as the guys that did that song from a while back (last year?) called \\"The Mob Goes Wild\\". Well, one thing is for sure: I'll be familiar with a lot more of their songs now, because I'll be keeping this CD in my car changer for while.<br /><br />I must say that I listened to this disk with a smile on my face the whole way through. Not just because I was thoroughly enjoying the music, but because I was picturing this good ole ZZ Top lookin dude fronting a Lynard Skynard crew jamming the songs out. But I just caught their video \\"Burning Beard\\" over on Launch and what I got sure kept the smile on my face....It looked more like Joe Cocker meets Henry Rollins!<br /><br />So my visual perception of the band is a bit out of whack now, but that doesn't take away from the fact that Robot Hive: Exodus is an extremely fun, rockin disk. A lot of the songs have this Rage Against The Machine backbeat, but rest assured, don't expect Zack Delaroche or Chris Cornell. What you get is a unique, Southern vocal sound that kinda sticks to you. But I think that I heard that these guys are from Maryland, so go figure.<br /><br />Anyway, Robot Hive is mostly a rocker that keeps your head bobbin, your toes tappin and your mouth smilin'. It's also fun getting the chorus right to \\"10001110101\\" in order to sing along to.<br /><br />Rockers should give it a try.

0156907399|1.0|Please, let's put a stop once and for all to this farce that Virginia Woolfe is a good author.  She's awful.  Just terrible. Can any one of you honestly say you enjoy her books?  No, you can't. People just claim to like them so they sound scholarly and sophisticated.  Every single book is filled with rambling insanity about every little thought that pops into the heads of her boringly depressing characters.  Nothing happens in her books.  By the 5 page you want all the characters to die anyways.   <br /> <br />This one is even worse than the others, because it is basically an autobiography of this lunatic, arrogant woman.  Want proof she's an arrogant snob?  She once claimed that James Joyce was \\"illiterate and underbred\\".  James Joyce!  And as for her lunacy, how many times did she try to kill herself? 4 or 5 times?  And the worst part is, she kept failing!  What a loser!  She finally had to fill her pockets with rocks and walk into a river to finish the job!  And yet somehow, people keep exhaulting her as this great tortured artist, as if being out of your mind insane automatically makes your writing great.  It doesn't.  She sucks.  Don't read this book. <br /> <br />I hate Virginia Woolf.

1932100385|5.0|This book is fascinating, as well as extremely well-organized.  Dr. Campbell discusses the findings of his studies, the ramifications on our health, and then devotes a segment to answer the inevitable question: \\"If what you're saying is true, then why haven't I been hearing about this?\\"   <br /> <br />The answer, unsurprisingly, is money.  The meat and dairy industries represent huge, well-funded lobbying interests, and anyone telling you that meat and dairy aren't healthy is going to run into a wall of opposition.  Do you really think these industries are going to spend millions of dollars advertising their products each year, yet sit by idly when research detracting their products surfaces?  Of course not. <br /> <br />That's why you should find the reviews claiming Dr. Campbell's work is 'pushing an agenda' to be as laughably off-base as they truly are.  Unlike Atkins and the other snake-oil salesmen, Dr. Campbell stands to make no money if you begin the diet he endorses.  He is not selling any products or supplements, or defending his profits.  He is just pointing out what his research has shown him - that a meat-free, whole-foods diet is be much healthier than what we're currently eating.   <br /> <br />But don't take my word - read the book, and lend it to people you know who take their health seriously.  Dr. Campbell's integrity shines through on every page.

B000AMB21O|5.0|Based on the real-life diary of a south-of-the-border serial killer, \\"Santa Sangre\\" is a revelation. Directed by visionary film maker Aljandro Jodorowski, \\"Santa Sangre\\" tells the demented story of a mind gone south into the abyss of Opidial incest, murder and guilt.   In Jodorowski's film-- nothing is as it seems. Only in the final scene do we understand how sick the world, we humans call home, really is.  This is Jodorowski's most accessible film and probably the best intellectual slasher/horror flick since Hitchcock's \\"Psycho\\".  Don't miss it.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|Forget about what to 'call' this music, 'prog rock,' 'post rock,' whatever rock, who cares?  Music is what matters not labels.  What matters is these musicians produce such amazingly beautiful music that soars in places rock music rarely travels.  This music will make you cry tears of joy, sadness & everything inbetween.   <br /> <br />I think if you like Godspeed You Black Emperor!, Mogwai, Explosions in the Sky & perhaps Radiohead & Elbow you'll find much to enjoy here.  <br /> <br />Personally, I like their third album '( )' the most, because it seems to me to be one continuous piece of music that builds slowly to a terrifying climax.  This is a little more an accessible album (nothing wrong with that) & has some great moments.   <br /> <br />'Hoppipolla' is unbearably beautiful & majestic-- listening to this at a loud volume, you can't help but get swept up by the pwerful current of emotions swelling in the song.   <br /> <br />Track 4, 'Saeglopur' begins with music boxes chiming away with all these wonderful vocal tracks from Jonsi.  I swear you can hear little gears working away in the background!  But it turns into something of a cool groove.   <br /> <br />'Milano' is an interesting one with string drones & seems at many times to have the quality of a lullabye.   <br /> <br />'Gong' rocks & is just a melodic line that won't stop & the drums are fantastic!   <br /> <br />'Andvari' is particularly nice for its string arrangements-- as if they got Arvo Part to do some orchestrating for them.   <br /> <br />But the best thing about this band is MELODY MELODY MELODY!  Just when I thought melody was all but extinct in rock music, this band represents I hope a revival of melody.   <br /> <br />I really can't compare too closely a band as just as plain gorgeous as what Sigus Ros is like.  If 2005 produced a great album, this is it!  Go buy it NOW!  Submerge yourself into this bliss! <br />
B0007TKNL0|4.0|The musical was already amazing, breathtaking and beautiful masterpiece.  Now the Film, directed by Joel Schumacher, is a wonderfull experience that will take your soul and pulls it into it's world of lust, passion and endless love.    The story is so spectacular, ammazing, and written with such passion, it will take your breath away.   Andrew Lloyd Webbers masterpiece is as timeless as love itself and will hold your breath the whole time.    The movie has spectacular sets, beautiful music, songs that you'll never forget, and a cast that hits the bullseye.    Gerard Butler, the one I actually never considerd playing the phantom, does a fantastic job! He portrais the phantom with perfect emotion, passion, lust and hate. He knows how to portray the clouded soul of the phantom with great acting.    Emmy Rossum: Wow! A true beauty with a voice of an angel portrais the lovely Christine, the woman who enchants the phantom's hart. She acts wonderfull.   Just like Gerard Butler: she makes the film work.    I've finished watching this movie for the first time about an half an hour ago, and the songs are still echoing in my mind. The scenes are still playing in my toughts.  So do you want to see a beautiful musical drama: this movie is definitly the adventure for you.  Full of emotion, drama, lust, pasion and most of all, full of love and music.    Spectacular...    A film that I will never forget.

1593082649|5.0|I approached this book somewhat warily, knowing that Northanger Abbey was to some degree a satirical take on the immense popularity of Gothic romances such as Ann Radcliffe's The Mysteries of Udolpho, a book I dearly love. Happily, Austen's means of poking fun at Gothic horror literature are far from mean-spirited and, as a matter of fact, can be delightfully humorous indeed. Her heroine, Catherine Morland, is by no means the type of heroine to be found in the giant tomes of Radcliffe and her indulgent imitators, as Austen tells her reading audience directly from the very start. \\"Almost attractive\\" on a good day, this unintellectual tomboy has reached her fifteenth year without inspiring a young man's fancy, nor would she be able to delight him with musical skill or even draw his profile in her secret notebooks if she had. Having encountered no strangers who would prove to be a lord or prince in disguise, her heroic ambitions seem stymied at best until fate steps in and grants her a stay of several weeks in the delightful town of Bath. Making her transition from naïve girl to equally naïve young lady, Catherine almost immediately falls quite in love with young Henry Tilney, while at the same time she becomes intimate friends with an older young lady named Isabella, whose inconstancy as both friend and intended beloved of Catherine's own brother eventually brings her much pain. To her intense delight, however, Catherine is invited by General Tilney, Henry's father, to spend some few weeks in his home, Northanger Abbey. Her joy at spending such private time in the company of her beloved and new best friend Eleanor Tilney is immense, but equally exciting to her is the chance to spend time in a mysterious former abbey of the sort she has read so much about. Such Gothic romances as Udolpho have been the source of her recent heroic training, and she is wildly desirous and fully expectant of discovering hidden passages, dark secrets, frightening circumstances, and possibly even incalcitrant perfidy in the halls of her beloved's family home. Her overactive imagination runs wild in Northanger Abbey, bringing her a fair share of embarrassment, but the very sweet and tender sensibilities that fuel her fire for Gothic mystery make her all the more endearing to me. Catherine is remarkably innocent, and as such she is absolutely delightful in my eyes.<br /><br />Much of the story does fit in with your typical Gothic novel, but the frightening and dismaying things Catherine eventually discovers are of a far from supernatural sort. Ever so gradually, a true monster slowly coalesces from the pages of this remarkable novel. I, like young Catherine, was somewhat overenthusiastic concerning the Gothic qualities of this adventure I feel I shared with her, and the truly despicable thoughts and actions of the book's villain did not immediately strike me as forcefully as they should have; the afterword by Elizabeth Hardwick included in my Signet Classic copy of the book, however, served to make me fully comprehend its import. Greed, selfishness, pride-these are the horrors of Northanger Abbey, and it does deeply hurt a reader of romantic sensitivity to stand idly by, unable to aid and assist a sweet young lady such as Catherine in her time of despair and emotional suffering.<br /><br />Lovers of Gothic horror or literature in general will surely find nothing but delight in the pages of Northanger Abbey. Austen's critique of Gothic literature is quite subdued, and I actually find immense pleasure in the overindulgence the author sometimes employs in her attempts to satirize it. Written by Austen at a tender age (though not published until the year following her death), Northanger Abbey features incredibly human, complex characters full of wit and charm. The hidden motives of seemingly delightful friends is brought to light, teaching young Catherine as well as the reader a painful lesson in real life, yet romance stands at the ready to right the wrongs of self-interest, deception, and greed. I absolutely adore this novel and everything about it.rongs of self-interest, deception, and greed. I absolutely adore this novel and everything about it.

B000A0GP4K|5.0|When you get to the end, you want to start all over again. That's the No. 1 reason to own the DVD version of Martin Scorsese's \\"No Direction Home.\\"  Coming from a project so awash in audio and video treasures, it seems odd that the only meaningful extras are complete versions of Dylan numbers trimmed in the documentary. That said, there are some great performances in the extras -- for example, the 8-minute version of \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" with the band that became the Band.<br /><br />The DVD's Dolby Digital 5.1 audio achieves reference quality. Images are TV-friendly full screen, with pleasing grays and medium contrasts. The video texture is amazingly consistent given the Babylon of sources.<br /><br />The film's subtitle should be something like \\"Bob Dylan, 1960-65.\\" Dylan acts as his own witness throughout -- at ease, clear, sometimes funny and seemingly pleased to take control of his legend. \\"I don't feel like I had a past,\\" Dylan says, but the assembled evidence proves otherwise. Part 1 unspools much like a video companion to Dylan's vastly entertaining biography \\"Chronicles, Volume One,\\" which covers his years on the Greenwich Village folk scene, the epicenter of American hip in the early 1960s.<br /><br />\\"No Direction Home\\" becomes A Film By Martin Scorsese in its dark concluding act. Like \\"Mean Streets\\" and \\"GoodFellas,\\" it captures the paranoia and disintegration as the central character's life implodes. The artist faced a far-flung confederacy of dunces, Scorsese shows us, over and over: moronic reporters, abusive audiences, uncomprehending music lovers, petulant folkies, teenagers who shrieked, fawned and grabbed. No one seems to have any sense except for Dylan and his in-crowd.<br /><br />Dylan's songs play non-stop in that gorgeous DD audio, but there is little discussion, surprisingly, of the groundbreaking music he produced in the mid-'60s -- no recognition of the vast Baby Boom audience that heard the genius in his explorations and embraced them. No one testifies to the deep and immediate influence of  \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" on rock innovators up to and including John Lennon.<br /><br />Still, it's easy and satisfying to buy into Scorsese's view of Dylan as underdog.

0312330529|5.0|I have no idea what the matter is with the few - very few- folks who did not like this book.  This is a universal story, rich with life-like characters and experiences in Bombay and Afghanistan.  Of course, they came from Roberts' life and he has translated them to his pages in wide-screen Technicolor.   <br /> <br />I have recommended this to an Anglo-Indian friend who is from Bombay, and she couldn't put it down.  Read it in three days.  Another friend had the same experience.  This is quite a feat, since the book is a tome, over 900 pages.  But each page is a gift that is to be savored, devoured and digested in sated satisfaction. <br /> <br />Johnny Depp has bought the rights, and I truly hope he will produce this into a film, as it will be like no other.  Roberts is writing the script, plus writing a sequel, and I only hope it doesn't take him 13 years, like it did for Shantaram.  You can check out Roberts' web site for the latest news by entering \\"Shantaram\\" in your search engine. <br /> <br />
0307276902|5.0|This book is undoubtedly not only the best memoir I've ever read, it's also one of the best books I've ever read, period.  The writing style is gorgeous, immediate, and unique, but the subject matter is unbelievable.  The writer's life--of drugs and crime and violence and sadness--is almost too much to bear at times, as is the suspense of knowing that any moment he might return to all of it.  (The story is about him being in rehab...but this is no \\"28 Days.\\"  This is relentless.)  I still worry about him after reading it, and after reading its sequel, \\"My Friend Leonard,\\" which is also great, but sadder.<br /><br />At times reading this book is a lot like being beaten up, but even in some of the book's harshest moments, there are little moments of kindness and friendship that are so touching, that I'd start to hope again, and my heart would melt.<br /><br />This book is full of sex and violence and drugs and explicit language, yet I would recommend it to every high school and college student out there, just to remind them of the danger of drugs.  And I would recommend it to everyone else, just because it is an amazing book.  My brother was so moved by it, he named an album after it.  Kudos to Oprah for choosing it for her club; I almost can't believe it--I thought she was into Steinbeck and \\"Their Eyes Were Watching God\\" and that kind of stuff.<br /><br />Read this book, read its sequel, and read everything James Frey ever writes.  He is a literary genius, he's alive today, and I couldn't be more grateful.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|this double CD thing, I'm pretty impressed, is it wrong for me to posit whether or not Dave shoulda sang on some of Nirvana's songs? (maybe he did, i don't know for sure). Did he always have such a good voice?  <br />   After buying this CD, I might have to take a look at some of their earlier work. I'm getting ahead of myself though. This album fits me well because in my teens I embraced alternative rock and grunge and had a deep appreciation for the groundbreaking music coming out of Seattle. Now that I'm a little older, I've mellowed outr a bit.  <br />   Most of the songs on CD 1 are quality, I'm not knowledgeable enough to critique music but in my humble opinion, it is good. The second CD, however, is better, but not by much. I liked the lighter songs on \\"Nothing left to lose\\" and these are comparable, but perhaps better. My personal favorite is \\"Razor\\". I've lsitened to the track four times already and I've only had the CD for three hours.  <br />   As for the whole crap about the copyright thing, it's a cat and mouse game. And I ain't playin cuz I haven't a IPod. So it doesn't effect me at all. I'm old fashined, I listen to music on my CD player. Does that make me old, I'm only 21.  <br />   That's it, I reccomend what ever.
B0002OERI0|5.0|At first I thought that there was no way I would like Green Day. I was totally against punk music and I was like \\"No way will I EVER listen to them!\\" But then my sister downloaded their cd off Itunes, and I decided to listen to it, just to see if I was wrong. I was COMPLETELY wrong! This is a truly amazing CD. There isn't a single bad song on it. Some of the songs remind me of Queen songs, and are up to that standard. This CD is a must-have! Don't pass it up. It's one of the best CDs I've ever listened to.

068983571X|4.0|With echoes of Edgar Allan Poe, this 1902 novel continues to delight mystery-lovers. Elegantly written in formal prose, the story focuses on the moor surrounding the ancestral home of Sir Henry Baskerville, an American who has inherited it upon the mysterious death of his uncle Charles. The moor is so treacherous that no one dares venture upon it at night-one step off the path, and the mire will swallow the unfortunate victim.<br /><br />Family legend says that a sadistic Baskerville from the eighteenth century once loosed a huge and ferocious dog in pursuit of a woman who had escaped his clutches, and that she had died of fright when she heard the dog panting behind her on the moor. The lecherous Baskerville, in pursuit, had had his throat torn out by this \\"dog from hell.\\" The ghostly dog can still be heard howling on the moors, and many believe it was the dog which caused the elderly Sir Charles Baskerville to have his fatal heart attack.<br /><br />In classically Gothic style, the novel features mysterious cries from the moor, foggy nights, an escaped prisoner, signals by candlelight, a butler who knows more than he says, a beautiful woman with a mysterious past, a small boy who carries messages, and someone who spies on the dark and isolated Baskerville Hall. Sherlock Holmes plays a lesser role in this story than he does in most others, remaining in London while Dr. Watson accompanies Sir Henry to his estate as an observer and protector.<br /><br />Holmes, of course, is operating behind the scenes, learning about the activities at Baskerville Hall through the daily accounts which Watson sends him (and which reveal much of the action to the reader). By no means the bumbling character which films have portrayed, Watson offers sensible advice to Sir Henry and shows a keen eye for details of interest to Holmes.<br /><br />Though the prose is often \\"purple\\" with melodrama and overwrought description, this contributes to the fun of the novel, providing a dramatic counterweight to the extreme logic of Sherlock Holmes, whose late appearance in the novel comes as a carefully timed surprise. The story is intriguing, the mysteries are well developed, the atmosphere is suitably spooky, and the resolution, though not really surprising, is appropriate. Even if the story had not been made into a memorable film with Basil Rathbone, The Hound of the Baskervilles would still be justly famous as Conan Doyle's best developed mystery, a genuine classic of the genre.

B000002LR6|5.0|While many people hold this in high regard as one of the best albums the ministry ever made. I think it's more of an update on what was left off with The mind and Land. Every track this record spews into your face is just another heavy assualt on the ears after another. Opening the right way with NWO, utilizes the use of catchy beats from the synth and proper guitar riffs and so forth, Al's distorted growls go well with the endless samples. Concerening Al's old heroin habit it looks as if Just one Fix takes a life of its own with loud Sabbath-esque riffs and pounding drums, this track puts you into Al'ss perspective with his addiction problems, good remixes with WSB on the single too. TV2 is built louder and faster then the original (which is the same only with a better vocalist), shame how connelly got screwed over, Al's screaming on this song is boarderline annoying, but nothing's better then laughing along to the lyrics. Hero is noisy crap about war, good lyrics and a nice solo through the middle of the track. Then the old hit Jesus Built my Hotrod captures the beauty of fast cars and insanity with a completely new singer taking charge, the vocals are hilarious and catchy but very incoherent at the same time, awesome guitaring too. I do prefer the mix with the samples more. Things progressively slow down with the almost grunge-metal sounding sludge of Scarecrow, I've no idea what the lyrics actually mean, but the slow jam is awesome, also there's those Led Zep similairities and whatnot. Title track is another slow desend into samples and reilgious madness (PRAISE JESUS!) good actual song outside of the sampling. But the industrial metal stops here with some of the harshest noise/dance tracks I've ever f**king heard outside of the earlier industrial acts. Corrosion is a favourite of mine only to crank real damn loud and to annoy everyone else around me, with a brutal beat and an even more brutal sound and to top it all off whatever vocals that would've sounded even slightly appropriate are just roars of terror. I love that track. Then the noise-exprimental Grace is the perfect example of Ministry using a synth to their advantage. I do warn Grace will give you a headache if you aren't tripping on any substance. <br /> <br />Even though this album failed to make as much as an impact NIN did during the same year, I do think that this is a waaaay more important and intelligant (wrong word to use) then anything Broken offered. Broken was getting back at those wronged Trent (isn't it that way all the time with Reznor?) Psalm 69 was a balls-out depiction of all things evil during that period of time. Why ministry failed after this is a mystery to me but everyone will still have all of the great musical memories. <br /> <br />Even if they make our ears bleed.
B000A6T1KE|5.0|a lot of long time fans did not approve of this film...i however am a long time fan in respects to age. i am 19 and have been a star trek fan since the series premire of voyager in 1994. i own all 7 seasons of TNG on DVD i dont like this movie because of the action scenes or the explosions...i like this movie because it gave a very fitting end to my favorite character...when i say character i mean the intricate details because i am a theatre student so i like to analyze...for the past for the 15 years before the movie we see data start as no more then a curious android...someone who always listens to what he is told to do and takes everything that is said literally...why? because he is programmed to do so...we very quickly learn however that his wish is to be as human as possible but he will never get emotions. we watch this evolve through the series where he is studying human emotions and tendencies...finally he gets an emotion chip from his brother but decides not to use it until Generations...at that point we get to see the character evolve even more with the feelings but still he is not fully human...still machine...at the end of nemesis he finally makes the final transition from machine to human when he makes the ultimate sacrifice...he knowingly sacrifices his own life for that of his captain and friend...i think it brings completion to the character and is ironic because the thing he strived to achieve his whole life was only accomplished in his death...that and that alone makes it the best of the star trek films yet...and of course the explosions are cool too :)
B000AJJNPY|5.0|I never feel good about reviewing a Sigur Ros album, because their albums seemingly take forever to even start to really dwelve into.  It feels impossible to listen to such amazing creation, then come on here and review it with words.  You could say that Sigur Ros doesnt follow your usual \\"verse;chorus;verse\\", thats for sure... their music is an epic landscape on every album made for open minds only, each individual album can transport you to a different place - With this album, they make you feel like you're in heaven... the songs here arent sad, theyre just beautiful & emotionally overpowering at times - Whereas most bands sink in quality after their first 3 albums, Sigur Ros seems to be getting better with each release...  <br /> <br />Today, I think Sigur Ros finally deserve to be officially recognized as the most futuristic band on earth.  Sigur Ros take the soundtrack to Earth 3000 years down the road, and bring it home here to the present time.  As a band, they're literally to this generation what Beethoven was to his.  As with any Sigur Ros album, anything less than 5 stars would be blasphemy, & I cannot recommend this album enough.

What a joy it is to be led by this talented author down a path where conventional reaction to daily events is challenged by the protagonist.  Why do we perceive things a certain way?  Why is what we consider 'normal' right?  Or is it?   <br /> <br />As you read this book, you follow Christopher Boone as he attempts to solve the murder of his neighbor's dog.  Naturally, this 'investigation' leads you down several paths which provides the reader the opportunity to live life as Christopher.  You meet strangers, deal with technology, and even become a parent to Christopher's pet rat Toby. <br /> <br />A great read - one that will open your eyes to the world of autism and the world around you.

B00009V8Z9|4.0|It's kind of funny how in many respects this is so much like Destiny's Child's album \\"Destiny Fulfilled\\". Why you ask? Because it seems like for much of the album he just bangs away at his piano. The songs sound quite alike and at times he seems too sorry for himself, this isn't saying the album is bad. Hopefully on his next album he will learn from some of the mistakes he made on this album. Some parts of the album are perfect, it's just not all of it is. Some of the lyrics seem a bit out of proportion for this album and don't seem to fit. Like the lyrics on \\"Belief\\" are a bit sexually driven and are quite stupid and lame. The whole album doesn't have a very sexually driven attitude at all, anyway that song is the only one that appears a bit out of the ordinary. \\"Chariot\\" has a very mature and overall wholesome feel to it. DeGraw seems to have real talent, writing all the songs himself in all, yet the comparisons I can make to Destiny's Child is unforgivable. Some of the songs are really amazing though, such songs as \\"Follow Through\\" and \\"Chariot\\".<br /><br />So, I do recommend this album as you may find it different to how I found it. But this is my opinion and you know what I think I'll stick to that for the time being!
B000A6CLL0|1.0|I loved seasons 1 & 2 - couldn't wait for season 3 to see the continuation of humanity's progress into space, evolution of our technology, etc. <br /> <br />Disappointment is not a strong enough word. <br /> <br />Least importantly \\"they\\" have messed with the theme tune (for ratings?). It's got the Quantum Leap beat now and doesn't pick up at the chorus anymore - the cool guitar bit behind \\"no-one's gonna bend or break me\\" is gone too :-( . <br /> <br />The entire season feels like a cross between the worst bits of Voyager and the dreary slow drawn out end to DS9 where ONE single predictable plot gets spread out over pretty much a whole season (like not enough butter over too much bread ;-) ). <br /> <br />You can tell where these plots are going (or rather, HAVE to go) and \\"the clock's ticking for the whole season\\" which kills off any chance for variation in story types and introduction of new ideas because the crew would be negligent to stay in any one place for longer than they had to. <br /> <br />I can go to work to feel that kind of pressure, thanks. <br /> <br />In my opinion it takes until the end of the second disk before there's a good episode.  Also there are a few less episodes than previously. <br /> <br />I wish I had not bought this. <br /> <br />SEASONS 1 & 2 ARE WORTH BUYING!!!
B0000019PA|5.0|Jeff Mangum sings the things most of us don't dare say aloud, both beautifully, and tragically. This album is one of the few in a collection that one can throw on no matter what mood they're in. this album is almost flawless. It may not appeal to everyone's tastes, but not everyone has good taste.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|The item I ordered was in excellent condition.  I received <br />it quickly too.  I would order from this seller again.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I didn't know that a band called Green Day existed until this album which just exploded onto the music scene, though I do remember a song called \\"Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life)\\" a couple of years back and really liked it. Though I didn't know it at the time that song was by one of the greatest bands ever.<br /><br />What this album shows is the superb class of Green Day. The concept of the album is so innovative and the structure of songs such as \\"Jesus Of Suburbia\\" and \\"Homecoming\\" is brilliant. The whole album tells a story and they don't just bash Bush the whole album as you may have been inclined to think.<br /><br />With so many songs on an album, yes I am including those 'mini-songs', it is hard to find an outright shiner because they whole album seems to sparkle with inspiration. But there is one great song \\"Holiday\\". \\"Holiday\\" is just one of the singles released from this album an although the video isn't that good the song itself is amazing. The guitars have an amazing melody.<br /><br />While their presence in my CD player is less now there will always be a special place for this album. Amazingly when I wrote this review the album was ranked at #11 in music (Amazon Sales Rank)just 5 days before this album celebrates its 1 year anniversary! A truly timeless classic that will chart for months probably years to come as we eagerly await their next album.
B000025XKM|5.0|Basically if you like dark melancholy folk then you will like this. I'll try not to sit here and gush about this album like an old woman, because I know both you and I have better things to do, but I will say that it is simply beautiful. There's some very good guitar work here that, although very sparse, is quite captivating along with Drake's subtle voice. This CD is so easy to listen to...it really amazed me how many people said it was boring. I really don't like the idea that Drake's music is just a current fad that will have been dusted off only to maintain it's popularity for a year or so at the most. It really robs his music of it's merit. Although he probably wasn't a \\"genius\\" like everyone whines these days, his music stacks up against ANY folk (including iron and wine, which i personally think sounds completely like artsy fartsy crap; sorry all you iaw fans out there). Nick Drake's music is really down to earth and enjoyable. This is his best album. Buy it.
B0000A1WNY|5.0|This album contains some of Frank Sinatra's best music.  His voice is at its peak and the Count Basie Orchestra is right with him.  You MUST have this album if you are a Sinatra-phile -- your collection will not be complete without it.
B00008OLYN|5.0|I'm not an Opeth fan, so I had no trouble enjoying Damnation. I was introduced to Opeth through Porcupine Tree. It's a beautiful album. There are no \\"cookie monster vocals\\", which is a hugh help when it comes to me liking a  CD. The lead singer's voice is beautiful. The lyrics are insightful. The music is mellow. If you like this album, I don't suggest you go and buy up the back catalogue of their music.  <br /> <br />I'm not Ed Pervin. He let me use his computer.
B000007S5B|5.0|Waiting for the sun if the third Doors' record. It has an unusual title. Again, it is an excelent piece of music and art and very remarkable. It features only 11 songs, although they can't all be called songs, there is some rock tunes, a chant, a waltz, it's very diverse album. The twelth song that the Doors recorded for Waiting for the Sun, The Celebration of the Lizard, was too long to fit the 45' LP so they threw it away so now only the live version of this one can be found on the In Concert LP I think. The songs on Waiting for the sun are all great, this are <br /> <br />1. Hello I love you. A pop song about finding a girl in LA, features an amazingly slow tempo refrain and a fast catchy tune. Simple guitar, drums, synthesiser and drained vocal arangements and the song was a radio hit in 1968. <br /> <br />2. Love street. A ballad about a wise girl, very poetic. Krieger's guitar sounds like a piano or haphiscord, it's a great. <br /> <br />3. Not to touch the Earth. Quite unusual song, I love it. It starts with fearful atmosphere with music resembling some march, turning into faster and faster happening. It's about escaping to some mansions and running or something, can't quite remember the lyrics at this moment...  <br /> <br />4. Summer's almost gone. Jazzy, dreamy piece about seasons changing. <br /> <br />5. Wintertime love. Calm and gentle waltz piece. <br /> <br />6. Unknown soldier. This song, to wich members of the Doors, who were recent students at Californian film school UCLA have made video to it, is timeless. It's about a soldier killed in a war. <br /> <br />7. Spanish caravan. One of the best spanish guitar openings in rock'n'roll music. One of the best Doors' songs, if not the best. <br /> <br />8. My wild love. A chant, and a native american and afroamerican blendure type of form, with four vocals and percussion. Very interesting piece. A song about whereabouts of man's girl, pure poetry. <br /> <br />9. We could be so good together. Rock'n'rollsong about man's aspirations. <br /> <br />10. Yes the river knows. A nice song about a river of wine. Very melodic, Densmore is a great drummer on this slow and silent tune, Krieger's guitar solos are simply superb while Manzarek's organs rooock. <br /> <br />11. Five to one. Pure delirium by Morisons vocals.

B0002Z0EYK|5.0|I just saw Troy last night and I've got to say that it was more gay than \\"Gladiator\\". Yes, both films show scantily-clad, muscle men sweating, getting dirty, duking it out and professing love of one thing or another.    In \\"Gladiator\\", the homo-erotic components is a little more subtle. Maximus is totally hot and Commodus is not. Commodus' dad, Marcus Aurelius has sublimated home-or-sect-chew-all attraction for Maximus and of course Maximus responds to it positively by going out onto the battle field with nothing more than a jock strap and some armor in order to cut off some German heads. Commodus is jealous and so he kills his dad, but then he wants to assume his father's role by consumating his (and his father's) attraction to Maximus. At first this takes the form of a loyalty enticement but when Maximus rebuffs this, Commodus unleashes a chain of murderous events that result in Maxiums performing in the Colloseum with a jock strap and some armor, a lot of tight, sweaty muscle men and even a few animals. Go Maximus! Anyway, Commodus transforms himself from observer to participant by doing a little disabling S&M routine on Maximus and then playing with him in the arena which is both scripted homo-erotic behavior and flagrant exhibitionism. So much for \\"Gay-ladiator\\".    \\"Troy\\" ambitiously sets out to out-gay \\"Gladiator\\". From the beginning  the eye of the homo-erotic hurricane is Achilles played by Brad Pitt. My what a bad boy Achilles is. He's late for battle with Thesaly because he's sleeping in late (nood) with a couple of Ancient Greek chicks who look like a couple of Ancient Greek boys. This movie is clever about that because it gives the chicks the same hair style as the little servant boy and fails to show their distinctive feminine traits such as their love tunnels, fun seats, and chest-o-plenty.    Achilles shows up at the battle field where he performs homo erotic combat with a total leather man from Thesaly. Then he goes home and plays with his cute little cousin, whacking wooden swords around and giggling while wearing cute blue dresses and having his hair sort of braided in blue.    Then it's off to Troy which might as well be a gay disco spread out on the beach at day light. BOM PID DEEEEE, BOM PID DEEEE, BOM BOM BOM will you just look at all those scantily clad muscle men charging around on the beach and jumping on and stabbing each other!    Ever the narcisist, it isn't enough for Achilles merely to do Hector. He also has to drag his body around the city wall behind his chariot boasting in a sort of modern prison movie manner, \\"Yeah, Hector: I DID him!\\" Achilles also shows as much of his nude body as he can get away with AND...       he shows his sweet sensitve side not to mention his pouty bad boy nature.    Oh and that combat scene between delicate little Paris and husky, aggressive Meneleus--c'mon. Gay! Gay! Gay! It's soooooooo gay!    Not that there's anything wrong with that.
B000002UWL|5.0|Behaviour perfectly captures the other side of Pet Shop Boys. Considered. Quiet. Very introspective. Adult. This is an incredible set of songs, one I have yet to tire of. And it hasn't aged a bit like some of their earlier material. I think it is the best the Boys have to offer. In terms of consistant songwriting, lush, rich, layered instumentation and production, and some of Neil Tennant's best vocal performances. Incredibly heartfelt and full of nuances. Every song on this disc is a winner. Nothing here that can be called \\"camp\\" or \\"ironic\\" ( things PSB have often catered to ). Behaviour is, along with \\"Very\\", the peak of the Tennant/Lowe partnership. They have since come very close at times  to capturing what is in spades on Behaviour, but they have yet to better it, and I don't think they ever will. Highly recommended.
B000AL730Y|5.0|Paul McCartney has released three 5 star albums in my opinion. The first one, Ram, is a flawed, quirky masterpiece. Band On the Run, his second 5 star record, is almost un-McCartneyish in it's consistency and slickness. Now with Chaos and Creation we have an album that isn't as beautifully odd as Ram and not as slick as Band on the Run. Instead we are treated to a full album of pure Paul McCartney writing, singing and playing. The album seems to be a road map or a history of the man's musical journey.    For tried and true fans, those of us the don't cringe at 'Silly Love Songs' and 'Listen to What the Man Said' and those who actually like the occasional silly lyric (in fact find a charm in it) this album is a boon. For those of us who search bootlegs for forgotten McCartney mini-masterpieces that were never released, Chaos and Creation is a pure heaven. The album is full of melodic songwriting we've come to expect from Paul McCartney. There's the double tracked, sentimental 'This Never Happened Before' which sounds like it could have been on Speed of Sound; the bouncy and catchy 'Fine Line' and the very twee 'English Tea' that harkens back to McCartney circa 1967. But then there are the surprises like the dark 'How Kind of You' or the George Harrison sound-a-like 'Friends to Go.' There are plenty of melodic hints of McCartney's past like 'A Certain Softness' which would not have been out of place on A Hard Day's Night or Help. But amazingly he never falls back to rewriting himself and the album is ultimately consistent and well produced.    With all of this in mind, Chaos will probably not convert existing skeptics. In fact it will probably drive them away. It could win new fans especially those in search of great melodic songwriting or people who want to understand the roots of melody driven bands like Oasis. The bottom line is that this is a melodic, sentimental and sometimes strange album and it will have its fans and its detractors but probably not too many folks in between.    Whether or not to purchase the DVD edition comes down to personal choice. It is not critical to own the DVD and the \\"making of\\" special seems a bit like an infomercial. If you can spare the extra bucks, get it \\"just because.\\" If not, save your money.It's the music that matters.
B00080ZG10|5.0|Reviews of THE AVIATOR seem to fall into three camps.  Those who hate it because it rewrites history...I'll admit right here that I don't know enough about the \\"true\\" history of Hughes to comment on the accuracy of every detail.  Others hate it because they find it boring or don't find Leonard DiCaprio credible as Howard Hughes.  The third group likes the movie. <br /> <br />That's the group I'm happily in.  It is by no means the greatest epic ever made, but for me it hearkens back to the glory days of the early Cinemascope, Technicolor Hollywood epic, but with better special effects.  The sets and costumes are completely luscious.  No expense has been spared.  You feel glamorous just watching the darn thing.  The acting, while very good all around, teeters close to going \\"over-the-top,\\" which is just what this sort of film needs.  It is not a subtle film.  It is trying to tell the epic story of an epic American who achieved epic things and endured epic personal battles.  A bit of bluster and scenery chewing is in order. <br /> <br />For example, everyone loved Cate Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn(heck she won the Oscar).  I admired her performance too...but when you watch it, you see that it is pretty unsubtle.  Was Hepburn, even in quiet moments, really so full of PERSONALITY?  But the film needs this to work. <br /> <br />Alan Alda was great...he plays slimy so well now.  In my mind, he's going to totally shake off Hawkeye Pierce and emerge as a key player of political villany.  In real life, he seems like a terrific, open, intelligent and easily amused person.  Scary how just a tiny tweaking of those dials makes him creepy.  Good stuff!!  Kate Beckinsale, out of her league, does okay as Ava Gardner, but the role is generic.  You never feel Ava Gardner...just some nameless starlet.  Gwen Stefani got a lot of mileage out of dressing up like Jean Harlow, but she's hardly in the film.  She looks great, though.  Jude Law has a tiny part as Errol Flynn...how perfect that casting is!! <br /> <br />And finally, DiCaprio.  Here's a huge role for him, one leaving him open to great failure.  Yes, I know he still looks like young teenager.  In GANGS OF NEW YORK, that worked against him...his anger in face of Daniel Day-Lewis was never threatening...heck, the guy could hardly grow a beard...how could he take on a master-thug?  In CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, he uses that boyishness to perfection...a role he was made for naturally.  In THE AVIATOR, they don't really try to make him seem older.  DiCaprio is forced to make us believe he is Howard Hughes by force of his acting...not his impersonation of the man.  At first, Hughes hits Hollywood with his wealth and boyish enthusiasm and starts making huge films.  He's full of nervous energy and driven to succeed.  That actually suits DiCaprio's natural look pretty well...so early on, we can see the boyish DiCaprio as the boyish Hughes.  As Hughes ages, DiCaprio can't (and other than a few subtle lines, the makeup artists don't try to age him), but by this time, we already buy him in the role.  His personality becomes more complex as his mental disorders become harder and harder for him to combat...and DiCaprio and Scorcese beautifully stage these scenes.  One great moment has Hughes in a public restroom, having just obsessively washed his hands.  Another patron askes Hughes to hand him a towel...but Hughes' problems simply won't let him.  He knows there's no reason not to help the guy.  We see DiCaprio's face racked with shame.  He wants to get the towel, but can't.  He groans out a \\"I Can't\\" over and over, as he's frozen in place.  He can't even make himself run away...his horror at himself is too complete.  This is pretty good stuff.  Later, when Hughes has gone totally off the deep end, and locked himself into his offices, letting his hair grow and his hygiene become questionable (at best), his demons have totally evolved.  So when he finally summons the strength to fight them down long enough toface a Senate committee (and the outcome will determine the survival of his airline), we root for him quite enthusiastically.  And finally, there are the scenes where Hughes flies his experimental aircraft.  First, he flies over a field and is forced to make a rough landing.  His exhilaration, even as he must know at some level that he could die, is palpable.  He's a kid in a candy shop...multiplied 100 fold.  Later, he crashes into some fancy suburban homes.  This scene is brilliantly staged, with great sound and editing, and we really feel we're in that crash with him.  It's horrifying.  And finally, the flight of the Spruce Goose is an emotionally climactic moment. <br /> <br />There's no doubt that Hughes was a \\"difficult\\" person...even without his madnesses.  He wasn't much good at forging close personal relationships with women.  But what Scorcese and DiCaprio have captured with THE AVIATOR is the spirit of a time in our history when great things could be done by great individuals with great ambition and drive.  It's exhilarating. <br /> <br />To those who found the movie boring and clich-ridden, I have no answer.  People keep saying that THE AVIATOR \\"isn't TAXI DRIVER or RAGING BULL.\\"  So what?  Spielberg's MINORITY REPORT ain't E.T. or JAWS, but each is a masterpiece on its own terms.  Frankly, Jake LaMotta in RAGING BULL is so unlikeable, the film has always kept me at a bit of an emotional distance (great though it may be).  At least in THE AVIATOR, I could root for Hughes and even sympathize with him.  And DiCaprio, despite all his foolish, tabloid-baiting activities after TITANIC, is truly one of our most gifted actors.  GILBERT GRAPE?  CATCH ME IF YOU CAN?  A BOY'S LIFE?  And now, THE AVIATOR?  He's the real deal. <br /> <br />Personally, I recommend this film VERY highly.  It's the finest mix of old-Hollywood ambition with new-style technology.   <br />
0307276902|5.0|I read approx. 10 books a week and this book is single handedly my read of the year.  The best non fiction book I've ever read.  This book left me breathless and I couldn't put it down.  I loved it.  I also love the follow up My Friend Leonard.  Awesome!!!!!!!!!
B00005ABKC|5.0|If you don't like this album you're dead to the world. Best song - Something Big. Makes you wanna pull a gun on the man before you put a gun in your mouth. Classic period. Sorry all you music aficionados it's a feeling not a review.
B000AL730O|5.0|Paul McCartney has released three 5 star albums in my opinion. The first one, Ram, is a flawed, quirky masterpiece. Band On the Run, his second 5 star record, is almost un-McCartneyish in it's consistency and slickness. Now with Chaos and Creation we have an album that isn't as beautifully odd as Ram and not as slick as Band on the Run. Instead we are treated to a full album of pure Paul McCartney writing, singing and playing. The album seems to be a road map or a history of the man's musical journey.    For tried and true fans, those of us the don't cringe at 'Silly Love Songs' and 'Listen to What the Man Said' and those who actually like the occasional silly lyric (in fact find a charm in it) this album is a boon. For those of us who search bootlegs for forgotten McCartney mini-masterpieces that were never released, Chaos and Creation is a pure heaven. The album is full of melodic songwriting we've come to expect from Paul McCartney. There's the double tracked, sentimental 'This Never Happened Before' which sounds like it could have been on Speed of Sound; the bouncy and catchy 'Fine Line' and the very twee 'English Tea' that harkens back to McCartney circa 1967. But then there are the surprises like the dark 'How Kind of You' or the George Harrison sound-a-like 'Friends to Go.' There are plenty of melodic hints of McCartney's past like 'A Certain Softness' which would not have been out of place on A Hard Day's Night or Help. But amazingly he never falls back to rewriting himself and the album is ultimately consistent and well produced.    With all of this in mind, Chaos will probably not convert existing skeptics. In fact it will probably drive them away. It could win new fans especially those in search of great melodic songwriting or people who want to understand the roots of melody driven bands like Oasis. The bottom line is that this is a melodic, sentimental and sometimes strange album and it will have its fans and its detractors but probably not too many folks in between.
B00005MP58|3.0|I'm disappointed with this supposedly enhanced/improved version.  For some reason, the picture quality of the movie is somehow \\"paled\\" in comparison to the earlier DVD release version which, even though has some digital glitches, has warmness to it.  I tried to compensate by adjusting the TV color, hue, brightness, etc. but to no avail.  Despite this new version having bonuses, I think they're not worth it if the movie itself suffered from the enhancement.  I wished I didn't give away my original copy.  Now, I'm only reviewing the DVD, not the movie.  The movie is absolutely fantastic.  I never get tired of watching it.  If you want to buy a copy of this movie, get the first release version.
1567184855|5.0|I found this book to be extremely interesting.  I have just started exploring this subject matter and found Journey of the Souls to be not only informative and interesting but exciting to read as well.  I still have numerous questions regarding our souls however am now reading his next book Destiny of the Soul in hopes some of them will be answered.  This is a \\"must recommend\\" book.  I talk about it with everyone I see and have already loaned it to someone else.  Thank you for the research and time put into these books.
B000AA305M|5.0|A pocket full of melodies, a unique voice and an excellent production: David Gray - Live in Slow motion. <br />It's magic.  <br />I heard first ALIBI and that's it. <br />OK. It's a little bit like COLDPLAY but the voice of this man sounds better than everything I heard from COLDPLAY, and I am a fan of them.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Iron Maiden fans will not like this because it doesn't sound as classic as brave new world or any of their older stuff but from a musical standpoint they are progressing and I must say that this album is better than brave new world.
0393317552|4.0|I do not care if Bill Gates likes this book. Neither it is important that American beer tastes like urine just because productivity of excellent German beer industry is only 43% of that of US beer industry.<br /><br />It is the first time that I truly realized after reading \\"GG&S\\", how important was (and still is) \\"geographic determinism\\". Check for example East Africa where the rainfall is greatest in the interior of the continent, so most people live there, far from ports and international trade routes. Much the same situation applies to other impoverished parts of the world, notably the Andean and Central American highlands and the landlocked countries of Central Asia. Being economically isolated, they are unable to attract foreign investment. Rural areas therefore remain stuck in a vicious cycle of poverty, hunger, illness and illiteracy<br /><br />This book is a very inventive, powerful and detailed historical study of human societies. Historical systems are complex and chaotic behavior tends to make history unpredictable, colorful and explosive. But we humans are all the same, capable of hurting, killing, exploiting each other regardless of race or ethnic background. This is how ultimately we tend to compete: exterminating or enslaving our neighbors, using techno and military advantages, spreading at the expense of other groups. This means for example, that complex and advanced society of North America Indians would have been as nasty (murdering, bringing under control, locking in reserves, spreading diseases) as greedy and cruel Europeans, if they had existed at a different geographical location. Well, the above conclusion by the author makes me sleep better.<br /><br />There is certainly need for a shorter, more condensed version (say 200 - 300 pages) for students who want a fast course on how some civilizations immerged and some did not make it.<br /><br />The most interesting chapters, one should not miss are: \\"Necessity's Mother\\" (the evolution of technology) and \\"From Egalitarianism to Kleptocracy\\" (the evolution of government and religion)..litarianism to Kleptocracy\\" (the evolution of government and religion).. <br />

0679721037|5.0|Next to Night by Elie Weisel, this is a very affective and powerful book that gives us a glimpse of the actual people that were affected by historical tragedy. While reading this book,i couldn't help but feel sick to my stomach to think of my own country's stupidity to release an atomic bomb on Hiroshima. Many debates or thoughts that may surround this book is whether or not it was necessary for this event to happen, or if the war could have ended differently if it weren't for this tragedy. But more than anything, it  will make you think of how so much carnage could ensue from a man-made weapon, and esp. make you think of how lucky we are in the 21st century to know for sure that nothing like the bombing in Hiroshima will happen again. If you are into history, esp. Japanese history, or the history of WWII, i believe that you will enjoy this. Even if you aren't a history buff, i think all people should read this. It may not be the BEST book to read about the event that occured in Hiroshima, but it's probably the first if not the only book that has first-hand accounts of the people who actually went through it and lived.
B000000W6R|5.0|What surprises me most about Pisces Iscariot is the sheer eclecticism that it represents.  These are songs that range from the barely-there acoustic opener Soothe to the all-out amps on 11 grind of Pissant.  Corgan forces sounds out of his guitar that don't seem to all be coming from the same place.   <br /> <br />The guitar on Plume sounds more like a truck revving its engine than any instrument I can think of, but the sound doesn't overcome the dry sarcasm of the line \\"Oh yeah, another day. Oh yeah, gotta play.\\"  There's a juxtaposition of the empowerment of being a rock star with the self-realization that life is boring.   <br /> <br />Pisces Iscariot is a statement of what music the band felt had gone too far to fit on a conventional record; material that's too personal, too indulgent.  There's a cover of Landslide on here.  There's an epic monster.  The booklet itself is made as if just thrown together at the last moment on rice paper. <br /> <br />It's an album of disparate songs, but they somehow fit together.  You can hear cars going by in the background.  It sounds like Chicago. <br /> <br />Ironically, it's in the b-side collection that I find music that I think best reflects what the pumpkins were about. <br /> <br />And it's totally great.
B000AL730O|5.0|Wow! Paul McCartney has given us a stunning album. That exquisite voice and the music matchup perfectly on every song. The unusual instruments and the strings are all beautiful. No stinkers on this thing. Of course some of the songs remind us of others from his catalog. After hundreds of songs there has to be a little overlap. Hearing this cd does not make me want to put on another McCartney album, it makes me want to hear THIS ONE again!   <br />Wow!
B000089A07|5.0|After 3 movies had chronicled the exploits of the deranged, cannibalistic doctor, Hannibal Lecter, with great critical and commercial success I might add.  Universal Studios felt it wise to return to Lecter's beginning as a serial killer by making the Thomas Harris novel, Red Dragon (this book contains the first appearance of Lecter), into a movie yet again.  A previous version already existed called \\"Manhunter\\", starring William Peterson as Will Graham and Brian Cox as the 'good' doctor Hannibal Lecter.  Universal Studios, for the sake of continuity, wanted to remake the movie \\"Manhunter\\", this time starring Anthony Hopkins who had portrayed Hannibal the Cannibal as he became known, in \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" and \\"Hannibal\\", so that all recognized movies in the Lecter series would feature Hopkins as the doctor.  Though many critics felt this was doomed to be a mistake on Universal's part, critics felt that Hannibal's story was played out after \\"Hannibal\\".  But to Universal's credit they marched on, hiring director Brett Ratner (Rush Hour & Rush Hour 2) to helm the movie, and casting Edward Norton to play Will Graham alongside Anthony Hopkins.  The choice of director's was another cause for concern for the critics, and many fans as well, but all nay-sayers were quickly silenced, when the positive reviews started rolling in for this prequel to \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\", and \\"Red Dragon\\" went on to do big numbers for Universal, earning it's place as an incredible opener to one of the Studio's darkest movie series'. <br /> <br />\\"Red Dragon\\" begins as FBI agent Will Graham (Edward Norton) is set to retire.  Graham is the man responsible for the capture of Dr. Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), but before Graham can retire he is asked to profile, and hopefully hunt down a vicious killer that is dubbed 'The Tooth Fairy', before he strikes again.  To do this, Will must come face to face with the one man he hates and fears most in the world, Hannibal Lecter.  In siding with Lecter, Graham hopes to shed some light on the deranged murders of this new killer.  But at what cost to himself or his family? <br /> <br />Brett Ratner really shined with his direction for this movie, he had shown his knack for action/comedies with \\"Rush Hour\\" and \\"Rush Hour 2\\", and his ability for drama with \\"Family Man\\", but there was still nervousness surrounding the young director, since this film focused on one of the most famous movie villains of all time.  With \\"Red Dragon\\", Brett Ratner solidified his place amongst Hollywood's best directors, earning him the respect he deserved.  Edward Norton was great as Will Graham, and his scenes with Anthony Hopkins were terrific.  He expertly portrayed the fearful respect Graham has for Lecter, while at the same time conveying the underlying hatred he harbors towards the doctor.  Anthony Hopkins, though looking somewhat older than he did in \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\", does a wonderful job of showing a somewhat more energetic and younger Hannibal Lecter.  Universal Studios clearly made the right choice in remaking \\"Manhunter\\", as \\"Red Dragon\\" does an excellent job of bringing the series together with Hopkins as the evil Lecter. <br /> <br />If you enjoyed the movies \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\", \\"Hannibal\\", or \\"Manhunter\\", then \\"Red Dragon\\" is for you.  In my opinion, after you see \\"Red Dragon\\", I doubt you'll have a need to watch \\"Manhunter\\" again, except maybe for nostalgia.  That's not meant as anything negative against \\"Manhunter\\", Michael Mann did an excellent job with the adaptation, but after reading all of the Thomas Harris novels, I feel \\"Red Dragon\\" really gets the job done in a more truthful way in regards to what is contained in the book. <br /> <br />\\"Red Dragon\\" is rated R for violence, language, and brief nudity/sexuality.
B000001FI7|4.0|This is essential Portishead. This is what started the whole thing for me. The sounds are amazing -- sometimes sweet and melodic, sometimes gutteral and disorienting. I think most bands today try to layer some pretty female voice over mediocre moody/techno music in an effort to copy Portishead, but it always sounds amateurish. I just loved this CD. \\"Glory Box\\" has to be one of the most fantastic songs ever made. I highly recommend this CD to anyone and everyone!    (buffysummers@excite.com)
B00005OMTT|5.0|Love it!! This is one of Engima's best albums ever.
0425152251|5.0|I had a great time reading this book. It has a fun premise and does a wonderful job of summarizing the theories and ideas of several famous philosophers. It definitely got me to think, and I thought it was great fun. I would recommend this book to anyone who needs a little lesson in critical thinking -- or in using their imagination!
B00006SFBD|5.0|\\"Deliverance\\" is yet another example of Opeth's brilliance. This album came out in 2002, only a year after the release of \\"Blackwater Park\\" (because they had good success with that album), and it might be this Swedish band's heaviest album. All of their albums are heavy, so calling this one their heaviest is really saying something. These songs are fairly consistently heavy and show quite a bit of death metal influence.<br /><br />Part of why \\"Deliverance,\\" Opeth's sixth full length, is so smart is they figured out a way to make it clock in at 62 minutes flat. But this album's songwriting is also great. The key to their success is recognizing the value of contrast (balancing and blending things which are very different). \\"Deliverance\\" is just so many things all at once. It is pretty and ugly, progressive and heavy, fast and slow, bold and subtle, punishing and satisfying. Some other metal bands (not mentioning any names, here) are afraid of adding melody, because they think it risks being called a sell-out, while others add melody just to break up their C.D.'s monotony. Opeth, however, do it just because they're so darn good at it! In addition to this album being full of soft breakdowns, singer Mikael Akerfeldt displays a very impressive vocal range by seamlessly switching from bellowing (like Deicide's Glenn Benton and Immortal's Olve Eikemo) to imitating a voice (which could be Justin Timberlake). The end result is an album full of great friction (between the beauty and brutality).<br /><br />\\"Wreath\\" begins with a fast drum intro before rocketing into a guitar assault, with some death metal roars. The drumming (by Martin Lopez) is very fast and talented throughout this song, and some melody is included, but it's thrown in late in the song (when the soft hand percussion makes an appearance).<br /><br />The title track is also driven by fast, thumping drumming, but there's an acoustic breakdown around one minute and twenty seconds in, where the drums slow way down and Mikael sings properly. The lurching, crunchy riffs and blinding double bass drums re-enter and take over the track again, but, even when the music is heavy, Mikael sings melodically about half the time.<br /><br />\\"A Fair Judgement\\" is a very atmospheric and depressing track. It begins with a piano (and some feedback from the piano keys), then the drums tap lightly, and the song stays soft until the electric guitars kick in (and even then, the beat isn't super heavy).<br /><br />\\"For Absent Friends\\" is a beautiful acoustic instrumental which is slow and melancholy.<br /><br />\\"Master's Apprentices\\" returns to form, with booming riffs, amazingly fast drumming (which sort of sounds like a drum machine) and more death metal barks.<br /><br />\\"By the Pain I See in Others\\" has more surging, sometimes machine gun riffs and a sprinting drum beat. To end the song (and the album), however, there's about a minute of silence, then Mikael comes on and sings a capella, with a dreary voice.<br /><br />In addition to being their heaviest, this album could be Opeth's best. It matches past greats like \\"Blackwater Park\\" and my personal favorite, \\"My Arms, Your Hearse.\\" So, if you own those albums, definitely get this one, too. And if you're new to this band, and you're wondering if this album is any good, my answer would be: of course it's good, it's Opeth!n and Mikael sings properly. The lurching, crunchy riffs and blinding double bass drums re-enter and take over the track again, but, even when the music is heavy, Mikael sings melodically about half the time.  <br />\\"A Fair Judgement\\" is a very atmospheric and depressing track. It begins with a piano (and some feedback from the piano keys), then the drums tap lightly, and the song stays soft until the electric guitars kick in (and even then, the beat isn't super heavy).  <br />\\"For Absent Friends\\" is a beautiful acoustic instrumental which is slow and melancholy.  <br />\\"Master's Apprentices\\" returns to form, with booming riffs, amazingly fast drumming (which sort of sounds like a drum machine) and more death metal barks.  <br />\\"By the Pain I See in Others\\" has more surging, sometimes machine gun riffs and a sprinting drum beat.

B000069HJL|5.0|This CD is a document of an almost perfect live-performance! <br />What I like most on this disc is the scenes between the songs: For example the introduction to \\"Breakfast in America\\" when Hodgson describes the meal on the concerts' eve (with an amusing english-french language-mix): <br />\\"We went to a petit restaurant and had langostinos, deux types of spaghetti, une type of ravioli, beaucoup de vin and deux grande espressos. Sorry, but.... it was an italian restaurant...\\" (barracking from the audience, because the Frenchman wouldn't accept that someone prefers foreign food in THEIR country of \\"haute cuisine\\", but then he continues: \\"... but it wasn't as good as BREAKFAST IN AMERICA!\\" (Loud cheering from the crowd as the first sound of the song begins)!  <br />If THIS doesn't give you goose pimples, what else does???
B00005JNNZ|3.0|Everyone says Samuel L Jackson is terrific as Coach Ken Carter in this film inspired by the true events.  I agree.  But at the same time, this unanimous praise suggests, when Sam Jackson is not on the screen, the film is your standard sports film with familiar characters in familiar situations.  Delete any scenes without Samuel L. Jackson, and this long (136 minute) film would be much better. <br /> <br />[COACH CARTER] 'Coach Carter' is about Ken Carter, who accepted the job of leading an ailing high school basketball team in Richmond.  Thanks to his coaching with hard training and strict rules, the team revives.  Richmond is on the way to the State when an unprecedented thing happen. <br /> <br />That is, because of the players whose grade in the class couldn't reach the required mark, Coach Carter not only blocks out the gym, but cancells the games themselves.  When being a good player means scholarship, Carter sticks to his principle that the adults cannot send a wrong message to the students -- message that being good atheles mean they could be above the law.  Quite natural that his decision enrages the parents and the community, who require that Carter should be dismissed. <br /> <br />[DIRECTOR CARTER] What happens next?  As you see, the 'real events' depicted here pose important question about education (which is probably a universal issue).  However, Thomas Carter ('Metro''Save the Last Dance') relies on cliched storytelling methods that were done again and again in the past.  I do not say predictability is an evil thing.  I'd rather welcome it in ususl sports films, but not here, because obviously Coach Carter made no usual decision, which should be more explored, and given more time than the 'house party' sequences we are not interested in.  It sounds cruel to say this, but Diretor Carter reduced the whole issue Coach Carter proposes to the formulaic story with 'big game' showdown. <br /> <br />Another defect of the film is its descriptions of the students outside the school.  The film's cursory treatment of the teenagers and their life is doing harm to the well-intentioned film.  Serious issues like drugs and pregnancy among teenagers are taken up and all settled in the most convenient way.  Clearly Director Carter has no guts to tackle the social issues as Coach Carter did. <br /> <br />Good news is that Samuel L. Jackson is back in good form after so many below-average films like 'Basic' or 'Twisted' (I don't count his voice appearance in 'The Incredibles').  And the scenes of the basketball games are realistic with the kids who can really play.  If only the film paid as much attention to the message that the real-life Carter is sending to us.
B000002JS6|4.0|I play guitar and I like rock music.  I have 5 of the bands' CDs, and this is by far their best overall work.  After the unfortunate death of lead singer Bon Scott, Bryan Johnson replaced the singing role.  Johnson does an excellent job singing and Angus and Malcolm show us how it's done with the guitar shredding.  If anything, I would have preferred more backing vocals by the Youngs, as in the album \\"Highway To Hell\\".  Probably the best three songs are \\"Hells Bells\\", \\"Back In Black\\", and \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\".  \\"Shake A Leg\\" and \\"Have A Drink On Me\\" are alright songs, but they aren't the best in the band's history.  The other 5 songs are in between on the rating scale, but don't take my word for it, buy the CD.  You won't be disappointed.
B000957O82|5.0|This movie has style and though the plot is predictable, the characters are engaging and believable. Will Smith is ultra-smooth as Alex Hitchens, a \\"date doctor\\" who mentors nerdy-type men into mastering their first 3 dates with the women of their dreams. He is coaching Al Breneman, a clumsy, kind, and completely desperate accountant who has fallen in love with New York's number one socialite, Allegra Cole.  <br /> <br />Honestly, Kevin James is fabulous in this movie as Al. His relationship with Allegra is occassionally more engaging than even the feature romance between Hitch and Sara. Most of the funny parts in the movie belong to Al as whenever Hitch and Al are together, Hitch has to play the \\"straight-man\\". It's only when Hitch is around Sara (played by Eva Mendez) that he looses his cool.  <br /> <br />The dialogue is well executed. There is a great scene when Hitch first meets Sara in a bar after Sara has dismissed a guy who tries to pick her up. Instantly, Hitch realizes that he must step up his game and approach Sara from an entirely different angle. Because the dialogue is so witty and fresh, the movie comes off easily.  <br /> <br />This is not a hard movie to watch by any means. Instead of watching cookie cutter characters which are sometimes common in romantic comedies, we get real people who have different perspectives on love and relationships. While they ultimately must serve the overlying function of the romance, we never get the impression that Hitch, Sara, Al, and Allegra are acting the way that they are in order to get to the end of the movie.  <br /> <br />All in all, this was funny, original, and great to watch. It's a good movie to add to your collection because you won't get bored watching it a second time.
B000069AUI|2.0|I don't get it.  These guys are not THAT good!  Other than the song \\"Clocks\\", I have a difficult time finding anything on this CD that is memorable.  I do have to hand it to the band - they did keep this album simple and it is not the same over-processed garbage that the music industry is putting out, but this band is not \\"there\\" yet.  But this album does not compare to anything Pink Floyd has done.
1878424319|4.0|This is a simple book filled with nuggets of wisdom. It describes people today living with a disease that is so common that almost no one knows that they are sick. Because of this disease, we wound and are constantly wounded by those around us. Part of the cause of this disease is the daily agreements we make to keep our wounds open and to support others in doing the same. When we make new agreements, our wounds heal and we see the world from a new and freer perspective. <br /> <br />Our first step toward healing is to become impeccable with our word. Here we learn how to change our communication to uplift ourselves and free others from our verbal poison. Next, we must learn to never take anything personally. When we take things personally, we give our power away to someone or something else. Sometimes, we give power away to our mind's subpersonalities rather than our core self. Our third step involves releasing the need to make assumptions. Often, we create problems in life because we don't ask questions. We pretend that we understand when we don't and then miscommunication and disappointment occurs. Our final step to freedom is to always do our best. This agreement helps us when we fall into old patterns and forget any of the above agreements. Doing our best keeps us on track and reminds us to be compassionate towards ourselves. <br /> <br />This book is written in a very basic language that is easy to understand. Its images are easily translatable no matter what culture we live in, which makes the book approachable. A teenager  could read it and understand it as well as an MBA graduate. <br /> <br />It reminds us that life is intended to be simple, but we complicate it through our agreements to be somethng other than what we are. Ultimately, the information in this book is information we have seen over and over again throughout our lives. How many times have we heard our parents and teachers say, \\"Just do your best!\\" or \\"If you don't have anything good to say about someone, don't say anything at all!\\" The lessons are ones that we hear over and over because they are universal.  <br /> <br />What makes this book unique is that the language is non-judgmental and non-threatening. There is no pass or fail, so if you find yourself making a mistake, you still receive the same amount of compassion from this book as you do when you are keeping all four agreements. The book encourages you to be compassionate toward yourself rather than to use the ideas as an excuse to load yourself with guilt or reproach. I cannot say the same for other books with this information.  <br /> <br />While in general self-help and new age books are designed to inspire and uplift you, occassionally, you finish a book and find that there is a stigma attached to making mistakes. The truth is that this is what the human experience is all about--making choices and then learning from them!
B000002UJQ|2.0|Please....someone explain this to me.  I have listen to this album a dozen times and there is nothing memorable about it!  The only reason I will give this 2 stars instead of 1 is that this album is better than most of the crap the music industry puts out there and then desperately markets.  But to compare this to Pink Floyd?  Come on, there is not a single PF album that \\"takes five listens to\\" in order to appreciate.  I am sorry, but give me \\"Animals\\", \\"Meddle\\" or \\"The Wall\\" any day over this album.
B000AJJNPY|4.0|well the guy who wrote the synth review doesnt know much but anyone at this page probibly knows that. its all guitar, bass, some keyboard action, alot of strings, some horns and drums. not as good as ageatis byrjun but nothing is. (favorite cd of all time, yeah I wrote a review) This cd is ( ) and ageatis put together. it really isnt the strait forward rock it was supposed to be but it is sigur ros all the way. great cd, up there in the top 5 of the year along with Feels (animal collective) and Illinoise (Sufjan Stevens).
B000005H7D|5.0|this is great album from John's musical career in the late 50's. the title cut is a classic as well as \\"Moment's Notice\\" which is one of my favorite Coltrane songs ever. love that melody.

B000003N7R|3.0|this pairing of jazz greats is such a strange idea. two very different musical thinkers who you might think would clash in the studio, join together in a nice little collaboration. the problem is, it's a little too nice. there is no real spark here and the players seem to be genuinely delighted to be playing together, but there is no overt displays of passion in these songs. \\"In A Sentimental Mood\\" starts off very warm and nice and it's great to hear Coltrane's playing over Duke's piano. but once you get the general idea, it's all of the same. overall, it's a nice little cd, but i cannot recommend it highly, there are many many more worthwhile albums that were made seperately by these two artists. still, if the mood hits you, you can slip on your cardigan and your pipe and slippers and listen to this by the fire.
B0002O39A2|5.0|before joining Gong, steve hillage gathered this ensemble to perform the music that had been fermenting within him while at college. This is some of his most progressive and complicated songwriting with elaborate time signatures and dense arrangements. the music has a thick texture of progressive improvisation and elaborate composition thanks in no small measure to the presence of dave stewart on keybords fresh from his work with egg; in fact this resemble very closely some of egg's great albums but apparently hillage wrote the material. in fact hillage and stewart started their musical careers together in a band 'uriel' in high school actually recording a very psychedelic jam session together under the pseudonym 'arzachel' which is also excellant but very differant from this. on this album steve hillage brings all his emerging talent to the table. hillage and stewart have a keen telepathy and the intelligence on this album soars. the music (like egg) is very involved and will probably require keen attention or several listenings to hear the canterburian magic of this great album. every single track is fantastic, including the two bonus tracks. hillages guitar is superb and abundant all thru as is stewart's keywork. the high level of craftmanship never falters and this ends up being one of finest recordings of hillages career. he actually composed material for a second khan album which ended up being used on 'fish rising' which also utilized the talents of his friend stewart. while not as psychedelic and quite a bit more progressive than his later work, this is an absolutely beautiful example of canterburian space rock.
B0009P42S2|3.0|I have been on an anime kick for sometime. My latest anime pic I recently rented is Katsuhiro Otomo's \\"Steamboy\\". The story takes place during the industrial revolution. A young boy named James Ray Steam receives a package from his grandfather which contains a powerful ball that pretty much harnesses the power of steam. Just as the package gets to his home, two suspicious looking gentlemen arrives at his home and tries to take the ball from James. James doesn't allow the agents to take them when he sees the note from his grandfather that the men are not good. This quickly sets off a chase between these agents and James. Slowly but surely the premise of the film of the goodness of humanity vs. the evils and dangers of technology is revealed.<br /><br />I loved the animation of the film. The combination of hand drawn animation and computer generated animation was gorgeous, especially towards the end of the film. The first hour of the film had me deeply engrossed but the last hour started to drag on for me. Sometimes I think director's cut versions of films are really not necessary 'cause they have a tendency to bog down the story of the film, and this is the case here on \\"Steamboy\\". I also was annoyed for most of the film by Miss Scarlett. I never understood her relationship to Dr. Eddie Steam. I only watched the Japanese version. America needs to stop ruining anime films with their dreadful English dubbing. It just takes so much away from the magic of what the Japanese created. All in all I did like \\"Steamboy\\" but the pace of the film was too slow for me at times.

0140277447|4.0|This book is one of those necessary but painful documentations of a historical period that can make one a disbeliever in humanity.  The Rape of Nanking was an event of history that really makes one question where the human ends and the animal begins.  In the beginning, the descriptions of torture, rape and pillaging actually made me feel physically sick and mentally depressed.  But as you continue through it, you start to get involved more in the curious question of How did this happen?  What happened to those who came out of it (both the Japanese, the Chinese and the foreigners) and the recognition that it was a human catastrophe, not a Japanese or Chinese catastrophe.  From it, we can learn more about what happens in periods of duress, anger, nationalism, and when people are let loose and given power and no limits.  It's not a fun read but the fact that Iris CHang researched this and put it all down for historical contemplation is an important thing.
0393317552|4.0|Jared Diamond offers a comparative study of the sociological and anthropological evolution of the world's different societies. Though his idea is no new discovery, Diamond reasserts the importance of the different environments in producing different societies. He writes that while science can fix a date for the evolution of homo sapiens form ape, it remains hard to tell why the different civilizations witnessed different jumpstarts at different times in history.<br /><br />Accordingly, Diamond employs his encyclopedic knowledge of human and social sciences to draw conclusions about how environment caused certain peoples to develop in certain ways. The difference in development eventually defined the human civilization's history.<br /><br />For those who have played the computer game civilization, this is the intellectual version of the game.<br /><br />Diamond's style is attractive even though at times, the reader might feel that the author has included some details - such as explaining the mechanism of carbon dating - that might seem boring for the reader.<br /><br />Also, notwithstanding the comparative character of the book, such a work should have focused on one or two civilizations at most, not include examples form world history at large. The book is interesting for those who are interested in the history of human civilization. Politics junkies might not find it as entertaining.
B0008ENIAC|5.0|What more can be said about this great movie, definitely one of Crawford's best. Great melodrama, and superbly acted by the entire cast. Joan Crawford's turn as the selfless, ambitious single mom is quite convincing, and Ann Blyth's performance as her selfish, spoiled, and unfeeling daughter is truly gut wrenching to watch. As the story unfolds, you wonder why mom continues to jump through flaming hoops to please her witch of a daughter. Eve Arden is at her scene stealing best as Ida, her restaurant manager. She is truly a joy to watch, and I found myself wishing her role would have been larger.  <br />This dvd also includes a documentary about the legendary Crawford, with interesting tidbits about the rift between Joan and Bette Davis, wonderfully narrated by Angelica Huston. The only sad part about the documentary was the inclusion of Christina Crawford's commentary about \\"Mommie Dearest.\\" Brings the larger-than-life Crawford back down to earth. Truth, probably, but didn't seem to belong here. Definitely a worthwhile movie to own for all who love the classics. Highly recommend!!
B0001I55OC|2.0|I wanted to like this movie, I really did.  It had everything I like (time travel, medieval Europe, a touch of romance, and Gerry Butler).<br /><br />BUT this movie was so ill-cast and so disjointed that it ended up being a mess on so many levels.  I realize that in any time travel movie there will be plot holes that the viewer must be willing to overlook - it's the nature of the beast.  But since the screenplay basically butchered the book and the movie run time was less that 2 hours, it was impossible to fill up enough plot holes to make the viewer willing to \\"suspend belief\\".<br /><br />Now to the casting:  who was the creative genius who decided to give top billing to a wet-behind-the-ears boy instead of Gerry Butler?  Hello?? Gerry stole the show and was clearly the male lead in this movie.  Poor Gerry, so talented and attractive - yet given so little to work with in this \\"time bomb\\".
B0002JJBZY|5.0|This was an amazing purchase.  I grew up watching Star Trek: TNG mostly, and had never really paid much attention to The Original Series.  I figured, \\"What the hell, I'll give it a try.\\"  I was not disappointed.  The characters are well-played; the concept, refreshing for the 1960's; and the writing, downright witty on many occasions.  Star Trek The Original Series is a great addition to my library.
B0001WTVUW|4.0|I go it to show my son what man kind can do to one's self, so lets hope for all of us that it never happens.
B000000W6F|5.0|And I don't view that as any kind of a hyperbole. No matter how you put it, the Pumpkins stand out on their own. Once I was listening to some of the songs on the first Pumpkins show, and it seems like by the time that they released this that they were just releasing amazing stuff. As for the thing about them being the best Chicago band since Ministry, I almost completely agree. And while I love that band, I happen to think that these guys put Al Jourgensen to shame. That says a lot, doesn't it? Well, for one thing, that's just my opinion. <br /> <br />A good thing about noting with this album is that most people seem to think that the band had two great recordings, \\"Siamese Dream\\" and \\"MCIS\\". Those are exceptional records that are actually a little bit better, but to me, not by much. If you like the hard-rock side of the Pumpkins than these three are a very good first buy (\\"Adore\\" if you like the more full-blown goth). This album has the psychedelia, metal, goth, and lots of other elements. After releasing singles from Limited Potential and Sub Pop, where do they go next? Instead of going for major label immediately, they went on Caroline. Also, if you found the lyrics on later works to be too self-obsessed (I really didn't), this is better for you because there aren't too many major themes on \\"Gish\\". It's a lot more of a humble record than it seems. <br /> <br />It is also clear that you hear the sound of an actual band on this album that you don't hear quite as much on future SP albums. \\"I Am One\\" even has a bass solo from D'arcy! That song shows where the band was at this point and it was really a good sign of how they could jam out. If anyone wants to prove someone that all of the band members were really talented musically, this would be the track to do that with. The punch continues with \\"Siva\\", which has amazing guitar work of Billy and James. I like it when the song gets more clean and \\"dreamy\\" as well. It's like a taste of more greatness that was to come. <br /> <br />Bass still shines in some of these songs that come later, too. A great example of this is \\"Rhinoceros\\", a good mix of new wave and hard rock that was kind of what the Pumpkins were. Once again, the guitar solo is amazing. Billy and James are such overlooked guitarists; nothing they do ever sucks. The vocals have some of my favorite melodies on Pumpkins tracks, as well. I like the way it fades out in the last thirty or so seconds, also. <br /> <br />Other highlights appear. The ones that don't stand out as much are actually great but in the company that they are in get overshadowed, unfortunately. \\"Crush\\" is notable for its interesting playing and one interesting thing of note is that the percussive sound in the guitar solo is actually Billy's jewelry. I am glad that \\"Suffer\\" got re-tooled for the trip-hop world, and this is one of two moments where the gothic side of the Pumpkins really shines. You should also check out the great music ability that is shown on \\"Window Paine\\". <br /> <br />In competition with the excellence of the first three tracks is probably \\"Daydream\\", where D'arcy shines on vocals, and there is some string in it. It's kind of like Cocteau Twins with less shoegaze, but don't worry because that sound is prevalent in most early Pumpkins work. It is backed by an alright hidden track, a performance of \\"I'm Going Crazy\\". A softer track and the only one on here where Billy spits out the f-bomb, it is nice to hear although it is not as great as the ten that are heard on here. <br /> <br />And while it could be argued that this could be classified as grunge, the Pumpkins have always had more of a variety in their music than their contemporaries. It is not as boundary-pushing as \\"MCIS\\", as layered as \\"Siamese\\" or lush like \\"Adore\\" but it still sounds out. And \\"Machina\\" unfortunately doesn't have the competition that the other four records do (it's not bad, but it's spotty). While not my favorite debut record of all time (that nod goes to \\"Visual Audio Sensory Theater\\" by Vast), I still think this is something of exceptional quality. Very few records today even come close to matching this album.
B000AL730O|1.0|I wanted to be amazed, but I haven't been for so long. Did success kill the spirit and the songs? Has there been no foil to push the creative envelope? Such raw talent. (sigh) I know there'll never been another Beatles, but I've always held out hope for Paul. Despite what the critics wish for, this is no groundbreaking album. It's just plain dull McCartney again.
B000002LK1|5.0|Yep, you read right. While they may have singles and remix collections, if there is one studio album that I could guarantee that you'll enjoy from Depeche Mode, it's \\"Violator\\". Nine tracks and not a single moment that you won't like. I was very, very young when this was out, but my parents were big DM fans. I can see why. I honestly think the only reason someone wouldn't like Depeche is because they don't like synthesizers. Which probably would ruin it for you, but you've also got \\"Songs of Faith and Devotion\\" and \\"Ultra\\" if that's what you wanted. <br /> <br />Every one of these songs is excellent. Not just listenable, not just good. Martin Gore's lyrics shine and so do Gahan's vocals. \\"World in My Eyes\\" has a memorable synth solo and is truly addictive. The album's also several of DM's well-known songs that you'll never get tired of. The endlessly-covered-but-never-as-good-as-the-original \\"Personal Jesus\\" appears, and it's a great, somewhat edgy and rocking tune, with a blues kind of melody. It shows that DM had a lot of energy and fuel in them at this time. Then it gets into the complete aural bliss of \\"Halo\\", one of the best songs and maybe my favorite. There is not a single thing that I dislike about the track. The dark feel of the song and the pulsing sound of the synth on this particular track are just too hard not to get into. \\"Enjoy the Silence\\" is one of their most popular tunes as well, and one of my favorite songs ever. I'm sure you've heard it, as it's one that I recall from the majority of my life. It's an example of pop music that works really good. The part towards the end is my absolute favorite part, though. \\"Policy of Truth\\" is equally as catchy and memorable. The riff is memorable and then you get into more pure greatness in the sexual come-on \\"Blue Dress\\" with its hypnotic structure and \\"Clean\\" with its catchy lyrics and nice beats. Towards the end it sounds more industrial and dark, but in the rest of the song, it's Gahan's melodies that standout. So yeah, start to beginning is really where \\"Violator\\"'s greatness is. <br /> <br />The mellow moments are nice, too. \\"The Sweetest Perfection\\" isn't any less appealing of a DM track, although one of the more sinister melodies on the album. I especially like \\"Waiting for the Night\\", which actually reminds me of some of Bjrk's mellower moments. In spite of this, it is definitely DM and this was when she was a Sugarcube still. The song's peaceful feeling is matched by the lyrics. <br /> <br />The segues at the end of \\"Enjoy the Silence\\" and \\"Blue Dress\\" are really interesting. They are also really entertaining, so even if it doesn't flow into an actual song, it's nice to hear. They can also work as good intermissions; sometimes I'll leave to do something else while those are on. <br /> <br />There are very few times when an artist's sales reflect their quality, but \\"Violator\\" is one of those albums. It's catchy, yet it's also got some actual musical depth and lyrics you'll enjoy. The segues are really interesting and I think that with its great price, there's so little you won't enjoy. They are a bit prolific for someone like me to really know what to buy next, but it's inevitable that you'll enjoy \\"Violator\\". Its five-star amazon.com average is not unwarranted. If you want to hear what alternative rock was based in before Nirvana, this is a good call. Or if you like electronic music, DM were real groundbreakers for that. And it sure helps to know that there's an album for you where you don't want to skip a single track.
B0000A4GAK|5.0|The unexpected tradgedy of Duane Allman left the band with a continuation of what they were left with, and the Band did its best, which was Jam! Wth defined Soul, and Blues, the Allman Brothers Band strived for this continuance for many years. Dicky Betts, was obvioulsy a limiting factor in the Allman Bros. Band's later progression, and then came Warren Haynes, form Gov't Mule with a reinvigorated \\"Southern Rock 'n Roll\\"!  <br /> <br />However, what Derek Trucks passionately embraces is the brilliant diversity of what Duane Allman was searching for (Remember  Duane Allman An Anthology), continuing to incorporate the diversity of appreciation and foundations from which they learned, within the defined already successfull style of The Allman Brothers Band>>>   Never forget how it was Duane Allman who was the creative spark, and intuitively so, Derek Trucks is running with the torch in a way that will make Duane Allman proud of how magnificent Coltrane's AFRO BLUE could sound with the smooth manifesto of a slide guitar. An hey, what's wrong with a flute intro???  <br /> <br />This \\"KID\\", which is a joke for calling him young, for discerning his musical appreciation, as well as his bravado for attempting to record measures fromm the brilliance of John Coltrane, deserves a more acute measurement in the dimension the Derek Trucks Band is presenting here in the 21st Century. <br /> <br />This Band is a deserved embodiment of how the blues, jazz, and pure rock 'n 'roll can all come together. An amalgum of music is what every musician strives for in there fortitude of composition!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000AJJNPY|5.0|This offering from Sigur Ros is outstanding. The typically hypnotic vocal style that permeates their music is here mixed to perfection; so well that at times almost clean vocals sound like backward recordings. This is complimented by clever, wonderful music comprising orchestrated strings, organ, piano, bells, horns, and at times a surprisingly heavy bass.     Expect a few more childlike, almost broken musical sounds and phrases, a la Mm, and a little less guitar - although, as usual, the guitars are soaring, dreamy sound-scapes. The Special Edition has nice packaging and looks fantastic with some beautiful pastel artwork, but really it's all about the music.     All up, this wonderful recording is full of unreserved optimism and is probably their best yet. If you like your music to be moving and inspiring, and just a wee bit unusual, this is it. It has more depth, variety, and better songs than ( ), which is saying something.      By the way, the editorial that states this is their first sung in Icelandic rather than 'Hopelandic' is wrong. gtis Byrjun was in Icelandic too.  Cheers, and, uh, 'thanks'.
B000AGTPUA|2.0|Ick - I thought this movie was dark and creepy.  The computer animation was odd and the elves looked like they came right off the set of Deliverance.  I couldn't wait for this movie to end and would have walked out in the middle of it, except my 5 year old wanted to stay and see how it ended.  She didn't ask to see it again, though, and now her school is having a Polar Express party for the 1st Graders - and they're going to have to watch this movie again. Ugh!
B00067189O|1.0|There is a reason this recording is the best selling jazz album of all time. The music is magical - I loved it when I was a teenager in the early 70's (despite being a \\"rock\\" fan), and it's still special 35 years later. I highly recommend getting the pure CD format.  <br /> <br />This disc is not a pure CD - it is a special new format called DualDisc, with \\"CD Audio\\"* on one side, and DVD video content and 5.1 audio on the other side. Seems like a great idea, a great way to get people to buy CD's instead of downloading them. NOT! Notice that asterisk next to \\"CD Audio\\"? There is a warning on the outside of the disk that it does not comply with the strict CD-Audio format, and it may not play on some CD or DVD players. If that was the only problem with this disc I say fine - the risk is worth the possible reward.  <br />  <br />But no. Despite the added content of the DualDisc format with various extras, the DualDisc format is treacherous, very treacherous. If you want to play this \\"CD\\" (DualDisc - CD side) on a computer, on a Windows machine it installs a small hidden piece of software on your machine altering the driver for your CD or DVD drive reducing the CD/DVD's functionality. I have not yet been able to reverse the damage this disc has done to my machine's software despite reading many posts about methods to do this. I never agreed to any software installation (I never would have), and yet my CD/DVD drives have lost the ability to do DMA. And to add insult to injury, the DualDisc - CD side will not play on my computer - I cannot even listen to it where I spend many hours a day. Outrageous.  I've wasted so much time on this DualDisc that I haven't had the time to watch the DVD side content. Unbelievable that I paid for this abuse - this is the way the publisher Sony/BMG - Columbia treats a legitimate customer? I don't have enough words to describe my loathing for the purveyors of this current DualDisc product.  This DualDisc seems to violate the first rule of customer relations - \\"treat your customers with respect.\\"
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I am so excited to see this available in the U.S.  I watched this on BBCAmerica and I was totally hooked from the first moment to the last.  I love Pride and Prejudice and am eager to have this also.  I will watch it six times a week.  It is an awesome film and has a great story line.  I think that Mr. Thornton is absolutely gorgeous and Ms. Hale a very independent heroine.  All the characters and actors are wonderful.  It is a must have. I can't explain how much I LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie!! Thank you Amazon.
B000002LND|5.0|This Album is a living proof that what has been said about her since 1983, is  even truer now: Madonna is unique... <br />This album includes some of the best Pop songs EVER: Vogue, Express Yourself, Like a Prayer and Crazy For You, and all of them  were Top 5 Billboard hits back in the 80's. <br />Definitely a must have for every Madonna Fan.
0792833279|5.0|Word's can hardly desribe the genius film. It is without a doubt the peak of mystery, romance, action and pure cinematic brilliance!  The fantastic screenplay perfectly shows how equally amazing Elmore Leanord's book is to the movie. It is also, by far, John Travolta's best role ever, and without him the movie would be nothing. This film is perfect for everyone, the alluring plot, amazing acting, entertaining screenplay.   It is truly, a gem.
B00006IK1C|3.0|While this CD really shines in certain areas musically, I felt overall it was more a sign of things to come. <br /> <br />The problems I have are the inconsistency of the writing, the slightly ragged, unpolished quality of some singing, and the  cheese of the sterile 'eighties sound' combined with verging-on-pretentious performances in a few places. <br /> <br />I took to Bruce's stuff a lot more after he left Maiden, regrouped, and went toward a fatter, more organic sound and regaining his powerful wail. <br /> <br />This is a nice little collection of ditties but it feels almost painfully earnest to prove itself as a pop record. Bruce made the point he could do that genre and write huge singles. The man later proved he could be a lot more interesting than that.
6305784116|5.0|Disney took a cue from French animation and created a wonderfully eccentric cartoon from its usual fair. This is a very light-hearted romp, as much fun for adults as it is for kids, with action scenes made into highly amusing capers.  The aristocats and the animals they meet along the way take on rich human voices, with O'Malley the Alley Cat stealing the show.  Song and dance are inseparably tied together like the musicals of a bygone era, such as An American in Paris.  It is all postcard-type scenes but wonderfully drawn, providing darling backgrounds for this family of lost cats.
B000A0GP4K|2.0|Dylan plays the same old cat and mouse game during this movie.  He give out no new information and ignores most major things we all want to know about.  For example, we never hear a thing about his wife Sara or his extremely heavy drug use. <br /> <br />A lot of this movie is a fraud to make Dylan out to be some mythical hero.  For example, booing is inserted into many parts where no audio of it exist.  The famous \\"Judas\\" scream is made to look like it was screamed as soon as Dylan came out on stage witht the band when it really came before the last song of the show.  Also they talk about a controversial speech Dylan gave, but never mention the controversial part where he talks about how he could see himself in the man that killed John F. Kennedy.   <br /> <br />Even with the people who put this movie together trying very hard to make Dylan come across as a Christ figure we see cracks in that shell.  We see Dylan being arrogant to fans and reporters while oozing with a very hateful hipper-than-thou attitude.  Through all this though the movie wants us to feel sorry for Dylan which is hard to do because his drug and party habits are what caused him to burn out.   <br /> <br />Overall, besides the concert footage this movie is a drag.
B00004XPQM|4.0|This teen scare flick is a cut above most others. Here, it is not some crazed killer which does away with most of the cast but, rather, the fickle finger of fate that selects the next denizen of the great beyond.<br /><br />The movie starts off happily enough with a class of high school seniors about to depart for Paris. Once they board the plane, our main man, Alex, cannot quite overcome his fear of flying, as he has a premonition that the plane is going to blow up upon takeoff.<br /><br />His hysteria is such that he, as well as four other students, is escorted off the plane, accompanied by faculty members, one of whom returns to re-board the plane. No sooner does the plane take off, it blows up in mid air. It seems that fate has snatched these lucky individuals out of death's clutches...or has it?<br /><br />Their relief, at having escaped being blown up on the plane, turns to terror, as it appears that fate will not have them cheat death. The lengths that these young people go to evade fate, and the steps that fate takes to hunt them down one by one, makes for a crafty and clever thriller. Teens and adults alike will enjoy this flick.
068987474X|5.0|Some readers might dismiss this book because it is written in a hip, yet humorous, style. It's a fast, easy read, but the message to women is timeless and dead on: actions speak louder than words. Especially when the words-of love and committment-aren't even spoken.<br /><br />The examples of when a guy is just not that into you are so obvious they should be placed in the Duh! category. But it's still worthwhile to read them again in this book. Once you get beyond the specific examples in the chapters, several larger messages comes through. These messages are: 1)pay attention to behaviors. Behavior reflects feelings, 2)people don't change, and 3)don't need to be in relationship so desperately that you'll put up with neglect, indifference, or even cruelty just to have a man. Learn when to bail.<br /><br />If reading this book motivates a woman to stop chasing a dream and, instead, spend her time finding a man who treats her like she wants to be treated, then this book will have been very much worth the time and money spent.
B00065JTBA|4.0|This box set revealed to me a couple of interesting bits of information about this band that I was unaware of.  One, not only is David Bryan an excellent keyboard player he can really sing as well.  Two, the drummer sounds like Tom Waits. <br /> <br />Effin' A! :)

B0000844I8|4.0|In 1968, a man named Erich von Dniken wrote the book \\"Chariots of the Gods\\" in which he proposed the idea that the pyramids of ancient Egypt may have been built by extraterrestrial aliens and not by ancient humans.  Though few Egyptologists gave any credence to Mr. von Dniken's idea, his concept may have inspired Roland Emmerich to direct a very entertaining sci-fi film in 1994 that was entitled \\"Stargate\\" that he also co-wrote with Dean Devlin. <br /> <br />The film begins in the early part of the twentieth century on the Giza Plateau in Egypt where archeologists uncover a very unusual object: a large circular stone with never-before-seen symbols engraved upon it.  Beneath the circular stone was an even more puzzling object: a circular wheel with the same unknown symbols engraved throughout its circumference.  One of the archeologist's daughters, a teenaged girl named Catherine Langford (Kelly Vint) finds a gold necklace with a pendant that contains an etching of the eye of the Egyptian god Ra, which she keeps.  The film then moves back into the present where a eccentric language expert named Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader) is attempting to give a presentation to a less-than-receptive audience.  As the members of the audience leave shortly after he begun his presentation, an older woman waits towards the back of the room to speak with him.  The woman is Catherine Langford (played by Viveca Lindfors, 1920-1995), who had earned a Ph.D. of her own, and presents Dr. Jackson with an interesting proposal to make some much-needed money to translate some mysterious symbols.  He accepts the offer and is whisked away by the U.S. military to an underground military base in Colorado.  There, Dr. Jackson quickly impresses everyone by successfully translating a message written in ancient Egyptian that contains the mysterious name \\"stargate\\".  He is then presented with the large circular cover stone and given the task of translating the symbols.  At first, he has no idea whatthe symbols are, but upon seeing some zodiacal star drawings from a newspaper, Dr. Jackson quickly realizes that the mysterious symbols represent star constellations.  Apparently, other Ph.D.'s that include Barbara Shore (Rae Allen) and Gary Meyers (Richard Kind), had already figured out the same thing; but they were missing the translation of one particular symbol and they needed a total of seven.  Since the project was controlled by the U.S. military and required top secret security clearance, Dr. Jackson had no knowledge of the actual stargate's existence, but had already understood from the cornerstone that a total of seven symbols were required to travel: six that identify the destination and one that identifies the point of origin.  The military commander, Col. Jonathan 'Jack' O'Neil (Kurt Russell), then tells the others to show Dr. Jackson the device and he quickly shows them what they had all been waiting for: the seventh symbol.  Upon entering all seven symbols, which the stargate rotates to lock into place, a massive wormhole resembling a sideways whirlpool is created.  Where the wormhole goes to no one knows, but the U.S. military intends to find out.  However, there's just one problem: who would be able to translate the symbols on the presumed stargate on the other side of the wormhole?  Dr. Jackson says that he can.  With that, he, Col. O'Neil and a group of soldiers venture into the wormhole and emerge on the opposite side of the Universe on an alien planet.  There, they will discover things that had been unknown to humanity for many thousands of years; but what they discover may also be very dangerous.  Will activating the stargate threaten Earth?  If so, can Earth be protected and from what?  Will the travelers even be able to return to Earth at all?  You'll just have to watch this truly imaginative film to find out! <br /> <br />With a combination of good dialog, an interesting plot, a creative way to expound upon ancient mythologies, mostly engaging characters and good special effects, \\"Stargate\\" is a very entertaining film.  Other important characters in the film include Skaara (Alexis Cruz), Sha'uri (Mili Avital), Lieutenant Kawalsky (John Diehl), Anubis (Carlos Lauchu), 'Good Father' Kasuf (Erick Avari), Nabeh (Gianin Loffler) and the leading alien known as Ra (Jaye Davidson), whom ancient humans thought was a god. The film did fairly well in theaters when it was released in 1994, and the Sci-Fi Channel began production of a TV series based upon the film and named \\"Stargate: SG1\\" three years later.  In 2004, another TV series based upon the original \\"Stargate\\" film and the \\"Stargate: SG1\\" TV series was unveiled on the Sci-Fi Channel and named \\"Stargate: Atlantis\\".  Both \\"Stargate: SG1\\" and \\"Stargate: Atlantis\\" have greatly expanded upon the storyline that was created in this original film that I give an overall rating of 4 out of 5 stars.  Other films that Roland Emmerlich directed include \\"Universal Soldier\\" (1992) and \\"Independence Day\\" (1996, which he also co-wrote again with Dean Devlin).
B0009PVZWI|2.0|In my opinion, the only two songs that distinguish themselves from the rest are \\"Best Of You\\" and \\"In Your Honor\\".  Aside from those two songs, Disc 1 is just a jumble of B-side mild rockers with nothing special to offer.  And I have to admit, I haven't listened to Disc 2 all the way through.  I keep falling asleep.  I fell in love with every previous Foo Fighter album at first listen.  But they have nosedived into mediocrity with this album.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|While I firmly believe that the Firefly legend is growing out of hand, it was a good show.  I watched all  the episodes when they originally aired and thought Fox was making a mistake by pulling the plug on the show.  It was however, as the DVDs show, not the best hour of television ever.  It was not even as original as its proponents make it out to be. Star Trek was the first western in space.  It was reliably good TV that confronted the capacity for good and evil in the same person, had moral ambiguities and examined ideas that seem especially relevant now, such as is it okay to steal under extreme circumstances.  I would watch the series if it started again.
B0002858YS|1.0|Im tired of hearing about how all these new bands are being put in the category of Rock or Punk Rock.  How can anyone even compare this Pop Crap to Rock? Im sorry but rock in roll is not about some girlfriend who looked like some boyfriend, that just means the chicks a cross dresser or shes really ugly and this band is talking about how jealous they are of her with another guy? what the hell? And im a song writer and its hard to come up with some good lyrics but who in the hell rights about that? COME ON! Rock is suppose to be about the Guitar Solos and lyrical combintation, the Drum Solo's, hell, even a bass solo, and alls this crap is some guy talking about god knows what, yeah, hes not even singing! there is NO talent in just steping up to a microphone and talking into it, come on? wheres the vocals? I can do that, its not that hard.  This cant even be considered punk rock, GREENDAY IS PUNK ROCK, these guys are in the category of TALENTLESS CRAP.  Rock N'Roll, PLEASE Come back! we need you more then ever now! Show this crap what REAL talent is!
B000001F9E|5.0|I know we all know, Zeppelin ,sabbath, Deep purple, but what about Thin Lizzy.<br /><br />If \\"Fighting\\" made Lizzy sound like a real great hard rock band, \\"Jaikbreak\\" had made them eternal.<br /><br />Perfectly mixing melodic riffs with heavy tones, Jailbreak is outstanding.<br /><br />Like all the albuns from this era, the most distinctable thing are the guitar duets between Gorham and Robertson (don't ask me which one is better)<br /><br />Check out \\"The boys...\\" \\"jailbreak\\" and \\"Angel from the coast\\"
0440224764|1.0|A complete waste of  time. After several Grisham books, I am used to the fact that after reading 450 pages, you leave with the feeling that 400 of them were superfluous. Still, most have a plausible plot, even when stretched to fit that precious inch of shelf space. However, this one has a plot so ludicrous, so inane, that I felt angry at myself for wasting my time on it.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and ignore this one!!
B00022TPTI|5.0|I've read many controversials about this record, most of them saying that this is a sabbath's uneven record. The very first thing that comes to mind when you think about Sabbath's vol.4 is experimentalism. So far, a heavy metal band, Sabbath decided to sound a little more expansive. I can certainly point a psychedelic influence in the whole album atmosphere, not only  the riffs but also the lyrics without devil rubish. The album is melancholic sometimes, but also happy, it floats like that, sounding refreshing, younger and reckless.<br /><br />It's a turning point from heavy metal to mid seventies hard rock sound the band would further develop.<br /><br />If you listen to this as a hard rock record from the beginning of the 70's then you get the spirit, I mean it's anacronical listening to this only as metal record. They had already created their own style and begun, from this point to diversify, and of course th influences will be everything that was going on around during that time. So you can hear the start of a compostion process that will be further developed on \\"Sabbath bloody sabbath\\", and yet you may recognize the typical Sabbath heavy riff from the previous records on \\"Cornucopia\\" and \\"Under the sun\\".<br />after all said and done, let's see the tunes here.<br /><br />Wheel of confusion - marvelous opening track. Perfect example of what is yet to come through the intire album. Melancolic, heavy, fast and slow, reflective. yes it's a new Black Sabbath 10/10<br /><br />Tomorrows dream - great song, great riff short and sharp. Perfect for a single release. The cowbell always helps - 10/10<br /><br />Changes - sorry, but for me is boring, not much for the synthetizers simulating a string session, but Ozzy's voice is over here. - 5/10<br /><br />Fx - overexposure to psychotropics. - 5/10<br /><br />Supernaut - Here's another example of a new Black Sabbath spirit, the song has a very groove feeling, with lots of percussion, maybe one oft he best Bill Ward's work on Sabbath during the 70's. A high time upbeat song hard to find on Sabbath's records. - 9/10<br /><br />Snowblind - Amazing hard/psychedelic track, the major hit of the album along with \\"Changes\\" and \\"Tomorrows dream\\". Despite the fact that the  subject is quite sad (cocaine addiction), the song is very beautiful. - 10/10<br /><br />Cornucopia - the song opens with a dark riff like the previous records and develops onto a psychodelic track with nice lyrics and a groove part in the middle. simply astonishing - 9/10<br /><br />Laguna Sunrise - It's clearly a derivative of the instrumental parts on \\"Master of reality\\" and a prepararion for \\"Fluff\\" on the next record. It's OK but repetitive. - 6/10<br /><br />St. Vitus dance - Wierd song with Ozzy giving love advices!!!. Anyway, i like it a lot. - 8/10<br /><br />Under the sun - Another gloomy riff and then things go lisergic and then goes a short track inside speeding up everything and then back to heavy/psychedelia until the increasing slowing dynamic that close the record. 8/10<br /><br />I still have my vol. 4 cover t-shirt, and i still get some good thrills listening to this. Certainly one of the 20 itens to take with you to that famous desert island.hard to find on Sabbath´s records. - 9/10    Snowblind - Amazing hard/psychedelic track, the major hit of the album along with \\"Changes\\" and \\"Tomorrows dream\\".

B00009ATIX|5.0|Never read the book, never saw the original movie..and I was completley riveted, had no problem following Solaris. I read many newspaper reviews for this movie and remembered they were very mixed--yet I was drawn to seeing it for mysef.  <br /> <br />Solaris is an emotionally deep, stunningly beautiful movie. My husband and I couldn't turn it off although we had other plans...we watched it straight through. The lighting, music and editing contribute to the effect...the pacing builds steadily, fraught with tension. I have been haunted by the images and feelings from Solaris. <br /> <br />Now I want to see the original movie too!
B000B5XZLU|4.0|this album is pretty much combination of all the past albums(funk/rock/disco). this is their best work to date. it's a shame their label doesn't promote them better.  it's usally by accident that i find out an album is about to drop. my very favorite traxs are 1,4 & 7.  if you are a true fan... Pick this one up!!!
B0007XT7V8|5.0|Pah!This is it. Pure rock music, nothing more. A brilliant voice and superb musicians comes in a firstclass production. These guys rock the world with overdose intention. Everything works fine. One of my faves for 2005, in line with JamisonParker, Jack's Mannequin and Tommy Lee. If you hear bands like Default (TOAD seems a little harder) or Ra (TOAD seems a little more directly) this is the perfect item! Enyoy and all the best for you.
B000A88F22|5.0|CHAOTIC is a crazy show. Some people say it's too much, some say it's great. Well basically if you know anything about Britney's personality, you know she really doesn't give a crap about what the press says and what bad things people have to say about her. In CHAOTIC you can really see and understand the happiness between her and Kevin, and that she has with all her friends and family.    The DVD includes all 5 episodes, the \\"Someday\\" Music Video, \\"Do Something\\" Music Video, never before seen footage, and a great bonus disc which includes \\"Someday\\", the full version of \\"Chaotic\\", the real version of \\"Mona Lisa\\", complete with brand new music, vocals, and lyrics. EDIT: There is no Remix of \\"Someday\\" on the US DVD.    The only downside to this is the cover! Britney and Kevin could have made a better one, but the content in this is a great buy for all fans and for anyone in general.
B00019PDKC|1.0|I think I might be one of the only people that thought this was crap but in my opinion it is.
B00003CXRM|5.0|Remember when a movie told a great human story?  They do still. No, do not read the reviews and/or plot descriptions.  No, do not read the fawning comments of others regarding the Coen brothers.  This movie IS BEST when the viewer goes in COLD, knowing nothing.  So, NO READING, just watching.  Unplug the phone, make some popcorn, settle back in your chair and SEE THIS MOVIE.  You'll thank me later!
B000A0GP4K|5.0|I love this music DVD, I learned so much about Bob Dylan that I never knew, I am glad I bought it.
B000002U82|5.0|This cd first got me into Pink Floyd.  Not only did this cd get me into Pink Floyd, but also got me out of the nu-metal trap that alot of young teenagers get into.  this Cd blew me away, and changed the way i looked at music.  Although not my personal favorte Pink Floyd  CD (Wish You Were Here taking top honors), It is still one of the best CDs ever made.
B000AL730O|5.0|I have to scratch my head and wonder about all the self-professed true-blue McCartney fans who are panning this with 1 and 2 star reviews.  No, I am not one of those fanboys who give everything the man releases an automatic 5 stars.  Yes, Macca has released some albums over the years that don't warrant more than 1 or 2 stars. <br /> <br />But this album struck me immediately as something of high quality.  McCartney seems to have invested a real sense of purpose and discipline in it.  In recent interviews, he has said he went into the studio with the thought \\"I want to make a great album.\\"  You might assume any artist of his stature and reputation approaches all his recording projects with that attitude, but when asked, Paul said he didn't.  He said something to the effect that he just recorded the songs and hoped everything turned out alright.  Going in with the conscious thought of making a great record seems to be new to him.  To my ears, that attitude must have really been strictly adhered to, because there is a cohesive feel to the record.  The songs flow from one to the next very naturally, making it hard for me to listen to just a few tracks - I end up listening (again) to the entire thing.  There aren't any weak spots on the album.  I can't honestly say that about very many McCartney albums.  The melodies seem to get lodged in my brain, not in an annoying way, but in a way that makes me want to return to the album. <br /> <br />As for the lyrics: most fans will admit that McCartney is not (and never has been) at his strongest when it comes to words.  He's not in the league of Bob Dylan or Bruce Springsteen, for instance, when it comes to telling stories and conveying messages on a purely lyrical basis.  But I will also submit that Macca is a good lyricist, and when he clearly makes an effort he can be a very good lyricist.  One of his biggest weaknesses, though, is leaving sloppy, lazy lyrics on the finished product.   <br /> <br />I feel this album uniformlysidesteps that problem.  Yes, there may be an awkward line or two here and there if you break down each song verse-by-verse.  But unlike some of his previous albums, I don't get the feeling that these are unfinished songs.  The lyrics are solid throughout, each song conveying specific emotions and meanings - with the words complementing the melodies and arrangements.  To reference the opening track, \\"there is a fine line\\" between simplicity and simple-mindedness.  And McCartney has walked that line, tipping over onto one side or the other quite often.  While he is far from the wordiest songwriter you'll find, at his best he can connect emotionally with his audience by using perfectly simple lyrics that often have a universal appeal.  On \\"Chaos and Creation,\\" that occurs time and again, especially on songs like \\"Too Much Rain\\" and \\"At the Mercy\\" (to name but two). <br /> <br />Before I wear out my welcome with a longwinded review (I know, too late!), I will say that I did hem and haw a bit about whether to go with 4 stars or 5.  Basically, as others have pointed out, uptempo and/or rock-oriented numbers are in startlingly short supply here. If you're looking for rock'n'roll, this is simply not the place to find it.  That bothered me a little initially, because I've always loved the versatility so prevalent on most of McCartney's albums.  But I found that as the album grew on me more and more (I was highly impressed even after the first listen, but I have found this album truly improves with repeated listenings), the lack of rocking material seemed to matter less and less.  Again, as I said earlier, there is a sense of unity and cohesion that holds these 13 tracks together and makes them seem part of a larger whole.   <br /> <br />One additional note, it's really 14 tracks as there is an instrumental piece tacked onto the end of \\"Anyway\\" that is untitled (but actually runs longer than many of the proper songs).  It's actually one of my favorite parts of the album because it does rock a bit and adds a real shot of energy that is very welcome after the concluding pair of ballads that close the record.
0375751513|2.0|The Picture of Dorian Gray is well-written, contains compelling ideas, and evocative. But it lacks substance. In my opinion this story is not really a novel because Oscar Wilde just uses it as a medium through which he can profess his views. While his views are not banal in the least, they are forced. He should not have to lower himself and preach to the reader.
0380778556|4.0|Rebecca is the story of a rather clueless and sheltered woman's experience of love, wealth, and illusion. It is a classic of the genre and the progenitor of countless imitations. It is also a bit like an extravagant work of confectionary--it is great for its few passing moments, it may even haunt your palette for some time, but ultimately--so what?<br /><br />Ms. Du Maurier is a master of the well turned phrase to be sure. Just read the book's opening lines. The ever-tightening web of suffocation that she weaves is truly impressive.<br /><br />Still, Rebecca is no lasting masterpiece. If it is the mentally haunting effect of the work that you crave, let me suggest you turn instead to the Man Who Was Thursday by Chesteron or any of the novels of Charles Williams. If you are a devotee of the well turned phrase, Austen, or even Shirley Jackson, is more effective.<br /><br />All in all, Rebecca dwells in the borderland between a 3 and a 4 star book.<br /><br />A classic? Yes. Due to its impact on subsequent writers.<br /><br />A masterpiece? I had dreamt a little more of Manderley than I found there.
0316096199|5.0|What can I possibly say about a book that begins with rape and violence (all the more horrifying because it's true) and carries on through conviction and aftermath? I love this book. I will carry it with me in the marrow of my bones -- her strength bolstering mine. Rape is entirely too common in this ridiculous world and the pervasive silence about it only gives it more strength. Alice has done all women, and the world, a great service in telling her tale. Now to get out and be LOUD about what's really happening. We need to cultivate a culture that does not tolerate rape.
B000AL730O|1.0|i dont understand why paul mccartney should have to reinvent himself for any producer or critic.i love paul every album he has done except this one and driving rain,those two recordings will put you to sleep before the 6th song is over...this effort makes flaming pie sound as good as band on the run....all the good material probably got sacked for being to simple for this great producer who worked with such great bands like radio head he might be great for them but not for the likes of a legend like paul mccartney..next time paul should go into his home studio with an engineer and do it his way and anybody who does not like it can hit the highway......brian foley

0689825498|5.0|I don't usually take the time to write reviews, but this book is so amazing that I just had to comment. I read several books to my son every night. He is only 4 months old and usually reacts more or less the same to each book (generally lseems mostly to just enjoy sitting on my lap and looking at pictures). But Dear Zoo is different! He now has started to understand that the point is to lift up the flaps. And he just can't get enough of it! He actually started crying when I tried to go on to \\"Goodnight Moon\\". The rhythm of the text and the simple pictures, plus the fun of the flaps really has him enthralled. Highly recommended!
0399152717|2.0|I'm a Cussler fan. When he does it well, he is among the very best. But Cussler is also uneven and sometimes he turns out a dull book --- and \\"Polar Shift\\" is probably the dullest Cussler novel to date.<br /><br />  Cussler's plots are always at least somewhat far-fetched. But in a good Cussler adventure, this just adds to the pleasure in its own way. The story moves so fast that you automatically overlook the sudden plot jolts or the bits that are simply beyond the pale.<br /><br />  This time the entire plot is so overblown that there is no way to do that. Part of the reason is that the whole book is silly. The characters are flatter than any I've seen in a Cussler novel. The dialog is often simplistic to the point of absurdity. There is a heavy reliance on characters eating and drinking to set the scene and sometimes it is just silly: do we really care that Kurt Austin uses Kenyan coffee beans?<br /><br />  For a thriller, the action is not only sparse, but unbelievable. You can stretch an incredible escape from danger just so far before it becomes farce. Here, unintended farce occurs often, particularly at what should be the climax. The scene in which the bad guys meet their fate reads like an outline of what was intended.<br /><br />  As a Cussler fan, I know he can miss on occasion, but I've never seen him miss this badly and sincerely hope it doesn't happen again.<br /><br />Jerry
B00005JKG5|5.0|For anyone who loves all things 80's this movie is a must have.  Jennifer Beals is stunning (even if she didn't do her own dance moves), and after watching this movie is it no wonder that her performance led girls across America to don leg warmers and sweatshirts with the neck's cut out.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves cheesy movies that are so bad they're good.  This movie is a classic, and worth owning even if it is just to see the stunning Ms. Beals take her bra off with her shirt still on.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|PLOT: The film begins at a Pennsylvania news station a couple of weeks after the events in \\"Night Of The Living Dead.\\" The zombie plague hasn't died down at all, it's getting worse. The station is sending out information about rescue stations as well as the probable causes of the zombie plague and what to do about it. Two people working there are Fran (Gaylen Ross) and her boyfriend Stephen (David Emge), the news station's helicopter pilot. The two decide to escape from the chaos by stealing the station's helicopter along with two SWAT team members, Peter (Ken Foree) and Roger (Scott H. Reiniger). They keep flying over the countryside until they can find a safe place to stay away from the zombies. They soon find out that there are zombies everywhere, even in rural areas. They finally find a large shopping mall and decide to land on the roof. The outside is crawling with zombies. There are also about 50 zombies within the mall. They almost take off, but decide to stay when they notice a way into the attic, which has no zombies inside. The group soon realizes that they are sitting on a gold mine. If they could just sneak down into the mall, kill all of the zombies and lock the doors to prevent more from getting in, then they could have the whole mall to themselves. It's a perfect shelter. It has everything they could ever need. It could be their own personal paradise, just as long as nobody goes and screws it up...<br /><br />COMMENTS: This spectacular sequel to George A. Romero's \\"Night Of The Living Dead\\" is ofen considered the best entry in his \\"Dead\\" series. Some feel that it is the greatest zombie film ever made. The film has a multi-genre feel: it has elements of horror, action-adventure, comedy, and drama. Romero continues to show how humans are just as bad as the zombies. The main theme of this film, however, is that consumerism has turned our society into zombies. The zombies don't keep coming to the mall for food, they keep coming to the mall because their instinct tells them that they want to be there. The mall was an important place when they were alive. This film also marks one of Romero's first collaborations with EFX wizard Tom Savini (who couldn't provide the make-up for \\"Night\\" because he was drafted to Vietnam at the last moment.) The gore is a lot more graffic in this film than in its predecessor. At the time, this was the goriest film anyone had ever seen. The film was later remade in 2004 by director Zack Snyder. The remake is a great film, however it is an extremely unfaithful remake. The only things that it has in common with the original is that it is about people hiding in a mall during a zombie plague; that's about it. The remake is not a sequel to the remake of \\"Night\\".  Romero followed up this film with the sequels \\"Day Of The Dead\\" (1985) and \\"Land Of The Dead\\" (2005). Italian horror director Dario Argento agreed to fund half of the budget in exchange for the rights to recut and distribute the film in Europe. In Europe, it was simply titled \\"Zombi\\". Italian horror maestro Lucio Fulci made an unofficial sequel to \\"Zombi\\" with his film \\"Zombi 2\\" (1979) [called \\"Zombie\\" in the U.S.] Zombi 2 even \\"out-gored\\" Dawn Of The Dead, and was followed by two Italian sequels. \\"Dawn\\" was also paradied by British filmmaker Edgar Wright in 2004's \\"Shaun Of The Dead\\" starring Simon Pegg. No zombie fan should be without this fine film. The Ultimate Edition is an awesome DVD collection. It contains 4 discs which include the Theatrical version, the Extended Version (which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival), and Dario Argento's European version (Zombi). The collection also contains several special features including two documentaries entitled \\"The Dead Will Walk\\" and \\"Document Of The Dead\\", a tour of the Monroeville Mall, theatrical trailers, and more.tells them that they want to be there.

The collection also contains several special features including two documentaries entitled \\"The Dead Will Walk\\" and \\"Document Of The Dead\\", a tour of the Monroeville Mall, theatrical trailers, and more.
B0000029GA|5.0|Without any exageration, this is unarguably the greatest hip-hop album of all time.  From \\"N.Y. State of Mind\\" to \\"It Aint Hard to Tell\\", you WILL NOT HAVE TO SKIP A TRACK!!! Any negative reviews should be disregaurded, as the reviewer is probably new to real hip-hop, and due to the vintage sound, didn't give the album a good listen. The tracks are as follows: <br /> <br />Genesis - The Begining... <br />N.Y. State of Mind - Will have you hooked, the lyrics are crazy. <br />Life's a Bitch - The only song with guest appearances: a young, hungry A.Z. and Nas' father, Olu Dara. In my opinion, this is THE GREATEST SONG EVER CREATED!!! The chemistry is simply amazing! Don't sleep. <br />The World is Yours - Dope song with catchy lyrics. <br />Halftime - Laid back beat with relentless rhyming. <br />Memory Lane - Familiar voice (Biz) sampled on the hook, another laid back song. <br />One Love - Extremely creative and original. Convinced me that Nas was one of, if not the greatest to touch a mic. <br />One Time 4 Your Mind - Nas showcases his skills on the mic one time for your mind. <br />Represent - Three words: Hardcore, raw, gangster. <br />It Ain't Hard to Tell - Tight beat with a Michael Jackson sample in it. Nas steals the show even with the outstanding production. <br /> <br />Conclusion: Love this album and it will love you back. If you're a hip-hop head like me, these are the 10 commandments.  Study them.  Share Them. Live Them.   <br /> <br />*It is important to note that you should refer to the tracks by their name and not by the track number.  The album seems to be constructed in a way that each track flows to the next, making it easy to remember them.
068987474X|4.0|I had been dating a guy for 4 years when I got this book.  He didn't want to live with me when I brought it up two years into our relationship.  So I thought it might be interesting to read this book.  Well according to Greg if a guy doesn't want to live with you after a year I think it was then he's just not that into you.  I didn't want to believe it at the time.  I figured we were young, not even 25 yet maybe he just needed to grow up.  Well he broke up with me a few weeks ago he told me he just wasn't sure if I was the one.  He had to have felt that way two years ago as well.  So ultimately the book was right he just wasn't that into me.
B000002KHB|4.0|The best Deep Purple I ever got the chance to listen.
0671449028|5.0|I loved this book from the first read. It is one of several books I read numerous times to my kids and is committed to our memories. It is one I enjoy sharing with anyone who has a baby - it can be read to a child of any age, but the toddlers love it, because they can relate to the message: bedtime can be fun! I give this book my highest recommendation: Terrific!
B0002S94OS|5.0|This is without a doubt the sickest batch of songs to be released in a long time. These guys are flawless both live and on tape. I can't stress enough what a major release this is for this band. I predict Lamb of God to be as huge as Slayer.  <br /> <br /> Killer CD, every track is ferocious as hell. Grab their others also.
1400032717|5.0|I am an ESL teacher and I am interested in different learning processes. This book allows you to look at life through the eyes of a 15-year old boy with autism. Very enlightening!  I thoroughly enjoyed this book!
B000002MTR|4.0|The Chilli Peppers are one of the defining bands of my generation, (we're getting older, yo!) These guys are still pushing sales and still got some goods left I'm sure.<br /><br />I was never really into most of the music that was popular growing up, I always liked the stuff that most kids didn't like.<br /><br />Maybe that was why I always dug this album.<br /><br />Yeah, its the weird mid-nieties one that everybody put down because it had DAVE NAVARRO on it instead of the other guy.<br /><br />I think this is my favorite RHCP album other than BLOOD SUGAR SEX MAGIK. It has a lot more gritty stuff that takes you back to the much much lesser known eighties material, its got the hits AEROPLANE and MY FRIENDS, one a rocker and one a ballad, both are cool. Driving bass from FLEA all over the place COFFEE SHOP comes to mind off the bat.<br /><br />This album is a lot of fun, and its a little diffrent, but compared to what? The only album before this was BLOOD SUGAR SEX MAGIK and that was completley different from anything before that. And wasn't that John Frisianti's first album? He was a new fish once too. The guy was coming off of junk, man. He was back a few years later. The later stuff gets a lot more ballady, though still good.<br /><br />Whatever FOOLS, I like this bit.
B000AA305M|5.0|This is by far the most sophisticated album he has released. very moving lyrics and incredible performance. this album makes you really want to hear his next album, becuase its soo good. he really has risen his game up on this album. it puts all the crap thats coming out of the same musical genre to shame. incedible. Just buy the album, and you will understand what this album really acheives.
B0000C1733|5.0|Ok, they did it in the early nineties after releasing ONE album that was a hit. Maybe thats why that album was called WHAT HITS?<br /><br />So, these guys should have a greatest hits package. After all, UNDER THE BRIDGE is still as huge as it was back then- although I believe that BLOOD SUGAR SEX MAGIK is a must own album.<br /><br />But, a lot of people like AEROPLANE and MY FRIENDS but not the rest of ONE HOT MINUTE and maybe I'm just in the mood for the radio friendly stuff instead of the crazy weird stuff some day. Not to mention SOUL TO SQUEEZE, one of my favorite RHCP songs that does not have a home on any other album. GOD FORBID I go find THE CONEHEADS soundtrack, you know?<br /><br />This is a pretty damned good collection.<br /><br />Weird. This is like the third greatest hits package that I haven't sh** on in like two days. It feels good.
B0002YLC24|4.0|Obviously, if you haven't seen the movie and don't want to know the ending blah blah blah, but one of the points many reviewers missed (both amateur and professional) about the rather nebulous ending was talked about in the first minutes of the film.  One of the bookstore audience--basically to paraphrase--asks Jesse if his character and the girl's (Celine's) ever meet again and get together?  Jesse answers that it is up to the reader to decide. An optimist will believe that they live happily ever after and a pessimist will believe that it never worked out between them and everything falls apart.  I believe Linklater/Hawke/Delpy deliberately left the ending up to the audience's interpretation, which I think is always an interesting technique.  The optimists quote \\"Just in Time\\" and the pessimists remember how Celine talks about being driven crazy by too much intimacy.  I'm an optimist, so I believe that they found each other again and won't let each other go so casually this go-round.  And they'll live complicatedly, messily, not always happily but completely together ever after.  <br /> <br />
B000002LQR|5.0|There are constantly less and less bands around that feel like they are going to be around forever.<br /><br />Red Hot Chilli Peppers, who proved in 1991 that they were more than an underground band (which they had been for almost ten years before the release of this album) have also proved that they are going to be on the scene for years to come.<br /><br />A lot of underground acts from the eighties found success in the early to mid nineties but never as profound. Usually they got their one big single and that was it.<br /><br />The Peppers had a story to begin with. They were pulling it together after their founding guitarist died from junk, and a petrified Anthony Kiedis was trying to get clean. This story would be the inspiration for the most powerful song they would ever have. UNDER THE BRIDGE broke them wide open. ANd with good cause, that song is still as relevant now as it was in 1991. EVERYBODY knows that song.<br /><br />As for the rest of this album, its all good. A few funky cuts, a few softer cuts....<br /><br />If you've heard any of the albums that pre-date this one, you'll know that there was NOTHING like UNDER THE BRIDGE. The old stuff was extremely bass driven and often times just off the wall madness.<br /><br />This was definatley the most inspired work by these guys and is one of those albums that we'll be hearing about for a long time to come.<br /><br />WORTHY OF A PURCHASE

0790729350|3.0|I spent a couple of nostalgic hours viewing parts of Woodstock, Monterey Pops, and The Celebration at Big Sur last night.  It was enough immersion to bring to mind the feelings of those times, not so much for the music, which in many cases was more raw and authentic than actually good, but for the hopeful sense that we were all being transported to Nirvana.  Not the later band, but the eponymous place where everything is vaguely \\"groovy.\\"  I have had the good fortune to have been a teenager in those times and I recall a definite connection to a youth-centered cultural movement that I imagined was going to result in a fine, fine world.  Of course, for teenagers, reality is easily summarized like this.  In its denouement, the movement, if it ever really existed at all, melted away like MacArthur's cake in the rain that became the seventies.      With the somewhat jaded perspective of thirty five years later, I now realize that there was a great deal of competition between groups and individuals even then, but it was more subtle.  Who was Hipper (German World War I admiral, worked his side's battle cruisers at Jutland), who grooved the most, who had the hottest licks on electric guitar, who destroyed his guitar better (Jimi Hendrix or Pete Townshend), who was the most far out, etc.  It was nicer in its being somewhat more undefined than who has played the most \\"quality minutes\\" in the games that now infest our current society's consciousness under the rubric of \\"Sports.\\" But for those who were in the business of rock and roll, it was undoubtedly a matter of life and (all too often) death.  Witness Stephen Sills and John B. Sebastian \\"jamming\\" offstage at Big Sur, and you quickly identify Sills as \\"Alpha Male.\\"  It's scary seeing Townshend at Woodstock looking at Daltry in \\"See Me, Feel Me,\\" knowing now what we didn't then.  Janis Joplin's Ball and Chain, with Big Brother and the Holding Company at Monterrey is erratic and scarcely a virtuoso performance.  The best partof that is how blown away Mama Cass appears to be.  You can't say much better of the vaunted Hendrix's work at Monterrey in his cover of The Troggs' \\"Wild Thing.\\"  Although you can see where Prince (not sure if we call him this or not now) got his ideas for some of his stage antics in Purple Rain.  Joe Cocker at Woodstock seems drunk and spastic, really kind of crappy.      The best Woodstock performances in my opinion, are Joan Baez' \\"Joe Hill,\\" 10 Years After, \\"I'm Going Home,\\" and Richie Havens \\"Freedom\\" and \\"Marching\\".  If you watch these, you have the essence.      Most importantly though is the unfortunate realization that a good deal of it was done for money.  One cannot help but cynically read between the lines of groovy talk from Woodstock organizers Michael Lang, his sidekicks Artie Kornfeld and the barmy \\"Wavy Gravy\\" (real name, Hugh Romney) that they are planning on making a killing by shrewdly harvesting from the all-too-gullible Nation they named Woodstock.  The presence of all of the documentary filmmakers gives betrays the idea that the film distribution and soundtracks were the moneymaking plan, not the gate receipts.  Piquant incidents, wherever caught, were lovingly recorded, and produced in the then novel split-screen format.  It was sort of a Reality Show prototype.  The actors were pretty much unpaid, even the bands were given less or nothing on what were shockingly small contracts.  In The Who, \\"Live at Leeds\\" album, memorabilia includes a contract for $3,200.00.  The \\"financial disaster\\" lamented on film by Kornfeld surely became profitable millions for someone along the way.      Irrespective of the cynical views above, I can testify that real, sincere brotherhood was closer in those grimy days than in the wealth and comfort of today.  Endless competition today stratifies every aspect of existence.  The fact of inequality cannot be ignored.  It's not clear that we are any better off, through it all.  It doesn't seem that music has made anyprogress.  And all of my friends from back then are dispersed, preoccupied and will probably never get together in any big way again.  The chance of any future be-in grows smaller as age begins to overtake us.  And sadly, the potential population of a sepia-toned reunion of those who remember, ratchets down almost daily.  Those were the days, my friends.  We probably didn't think about whether they might end, because just thinking about such things has a way of ending them. But, we've got the memories and they can conjure the feelings once in a while.  They were good.
B000001Y5J|4.0|Nine Inch Nails never has dissapointed me so far. When I first got this cd and I listened to the whole thing I didn't like it that much. but every time I listen to some of the songs on this cd I just like them more and more. A couple of these songs on this cd are some of Trent Reznor's most angry and innapropriate of all. (Especially the infamous Hapiness In Slavery) There are a couple songs on this cd though that I don't like. Including the opening guitar solo called Pinion. Also Help Me I'm in Hell. But the rest of the songs are definately worth listening to. Wish, Hapiness In Slavery, and Gave up are probably the higlights of this cd.  <br /> <br />Pinion 2/5: This is just a boring guitar solo to inroduce this cd <br /> <br />Wish 5/5: This is a great, fast and loud song to begin this great cd <br /> <br />Last 4/5: At first I didn't like this song, but like all of Tren't work it started to grow on me. I don't know if it's me but this song sounds a lot like  a song from Godsmack.  <br /> <br />Help me I'm in Hell 1/5: This is a really boring and unecesarry instrumental song. <br /> <br />Hapiness in Slavery 5/5: One of the angriest and obscene Nine Inch Nails songs I've heard. Basically it is about a man being tortured. <br /> <br />Gave up 4/5: A very weird and great song. It's impossible to know what he is saying without reading the lyrics. My only complaint is that his voice is a little too distorted. <br /> <br />Physical 4/5: This song I think is about a girl who just likes it rough. I'm not sure what Tren't singing because this song isn't even listed in the lyrics page of the album. It also sounds really different from the rest of their stuff, it's got more of a heavy metal feel to it. <br /> <br />Suck 4/5: Another hidden song on this cd. I like it a lot and it is pretty loud. <br /> <br />So there you have it. This is a very awsome and cheap cd. Besides the fact that it is only eight songs you will definately not be let down. <br /> <br />
0789723107|4.0|I recently purchased the first edition back in Jan. 2005 after several years designing interfaces for sites (please note that, now, there is a second edition released in Aug. 2005). I found the information provided in this edition useful and I think any web designer will appreciate having this book as a resource for good interface design. <br /> <br />There are enough reviews and editiorial about \\"Don't Make Me Think...\\" that I will not rehash what has already been said. However, I do believe that some may buy this book and say to themselves, \\"I already know that!\\" I did that too -- at times. Nonetheless, one thing I have found after several years in the business is that we sometimes forget the innate foundation of why we do the things we do when we design.  <br /> <br />This book not only reminded me of \\"why\\" we  \\"must\\" design for users of all skill levels, but it taught me quite a lot about some of the things I was doing wrong and thought was correct. <br /> <br />\\"Don't Make Me Think...\\" discusses how the majority of users approach and read a page on a site, and how they respond to various elements of a given page (and pages). The illustrations are incredibly helpful and concise in support of the text. The overall text and flow of the book makes for an easy read. Every chapter is a digestible body of great content -- a pleasure to read and/or review. <br /> <br />Initially I thought this book would cater more toward beginners -- however, it caters to experienced designers as well. As a matter of opinion, I think this book may very well benefit more those who have at least some experience under their belts than beginners since points made by the author can be applied to previous experiences.  \\"Don't Make Me Think...\\" is filled with practical advice, supporting educational material, common sense and affirmations for all levels of educational or professional experience. <br /> <br />Just a note: This is not a tips and tricks book but a practical educational resourcefor web usability. <br /> <br />Summary: <br /> <br />\\"Dont' Make Me Think\\" has a lot of great information in a well laid-out publication supported by excellent examples, charts and graphical illustrations. An essential resource for the novice webmaster and a great reference (reminder and affirmation) for those experienced professionals interested in efficient interface design.
B000063UR2|4.0|It looks like R. Scott has been taking lessons from George Lucas(the MASTER when it comes to screwing up classic films). <br />BE GLAD YOU GET THE ORIG. VERSION IN THIS PACKAGE!!!!!!! <br />Without a doubt...the orig. version is one of my favorite films of all time. Too bad all you would usually hope for in a director's cut edition ends up making this film suck! If you're a huge fan of the orig. film, you will most likely be VERY upset with the \\"new\\" version. Deleted scenes spliced into the film and the removal of the orig. score (some consider it dated...I don't) and the addition of a new one (more traditional) REALLY destroys all that I've always loved about the film. Also, the deleted scenes that are spliced into the film are in NO WAY useful to the story or your enjoyment of it. It's not even the same film after all the changes. So, whoever did the editing and score for the ORIG. \\"Legend\\" gave us a thing of beauty that in my eyes stands the test of time. This \\"new version\\" makes me ill as well as the other people I have shown it to. If you buy this item, watch the orig. first then the director's cut. I'm almost certain you'll feel the same way. Hell, I even missed the stupid YES song....and I hate YES!
B0007Y08IS|5.0|This movie made the whole history of civilization come into focus for me. Who would have thought that puppets having sex would give me such a throbbing woodpecker for days....? The tingle, even today....one year later, still keeps me up at night. The dialogue, the pulling of strings, the awkward lumbering movements, Kim Dung Eel....\\"So Roanery\\"....I will never stop peeing my pants over that one. I can now die a happy stupid Amerikan, knowing that the truth has been exposed, that the Apocalypse is now officially \\"ON\\"...and if your haven't changed your Depends Undergarments..........now, would be the time.<br /><br />Karma is a bitch....<br /><br />Amerika......Faulk Yeah
6305313687|5.0|THE MOVIE:  I cannot praise Edward Norton enough for this role.  In my mind, he is the 1998 Acadamy Award winner for best actor in a leading role.  His performance was outstanding and I believe this to be his best movie role ever.  Don't know if he will ever top this one. His portrayal as \\"thee\\" skinhead was on the dot.  His character Derek Vinyard, an all american boy, turned into racist, goes to jail, finds redemption and comes back to his old life to save his brother.  Very real movie.  Amazes me how somebody like Derek Vinyard could turn from such a deep rooted hate monger, back to a human being. It showed me that anybody can be saved.  And I DON'T mean saved in the born-again christian parrot cult way of the word.  I mean in the way of humanity, as being human.  Good movie, great acting by norton.  A must see for a lesson on racism, to any person of any racial group that they belong too.        (...)

B00004R9A4|5.0|This is a great family movie, right up there with Mary Poppins, and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.  My oldest children were brought up with them.  I was very glad when they came out in DVD so that my grandchildren could see them also.  I also enjoy watching them again and again.  They are the types of movies that when you want to feel good and lose yourself into the world of Magic and Beauty without alot of violence and sex, they hit the target right on.

B00006V9A0|3.0|Time for me to make a confession: I LOVE Nirvana. They were probably the best band of the early '90s, and a welcome return to the classic rock sound (which I also love) that had been abandonded in the '80s. And hey, when a band only released three studio live albums, two live ones and an outtakes collection thanks to Cobain's tragic suicide (which robbed us of an open-minded, compassionate person - not enough of those nowadays - and a great songwriter) , you'd better do a hell of a job compiling them. This is in no way an accurate representation of what Nirvana was capable of. Why do I feel so? Read on...<br /><br />Bleach<br /><br />Selection(s): About a Girl<br /><br />This isn't all that good of an album in my eyes. I love About A Girl, though - great pick. But hey Courteny Love, ever hear School, Floyd the Barber or Blew? I have my doubts...<br /><br />Nevermind<br /><br />Selection(s): Smells Like Teen Spirit, Come As You Are, Lithium, In Bloom<br /><br />This one needs no further introduction, of course containing the ubersmash Smells Like Teen Spirit and a wealth of other first-rank hits. Some are included here (Lithium, which I feel is even better than Teen Spirit; Come As You Are; In Bloom), but Polly, Breed, Drain You and Something in the Way could've all just as easily made the cut.<br /><br />I haven't heard the odds-and-sods Insecticide yet, but Been a Son and Sliver were pulled from that album, and both belong, especially the latter.<br /><br />In Utero<br /><br />Selection(s): Heart Shaped Box, Pennyroyal Tea, Rape Me, Dumb<br /><br />I love this album - I think it's better than Nevermind myself. And to only pull FOUR songs from it when it's also got the hits Serve the Servants, and Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge on Seattle - not to mention the several great album tracks. They did pick four great songs, but come on, wouldn't you rather have six songs from In Utero than four?<br /><br />MTV Unplugged<br /><br />Selection(s): All Apologies, The Man Who Sold the World<br /><br />This is my favorite Nirvana album EVER. And guess what, it's a botched job. All Apologies just may be my favorite Nirvana song in this incarnation, and The Man Who Sold the World is no slouch either. Still, Where Did You Sleep Last Night? is MIA, shame because that's either my favorite or second-favorite Nirvana song - though you can find it on the Australian import.<br /><br />The one song, You Know You're Right, is pretty good too. But Verse Chorus Verse and Sappy (two different songs, contrary to popular belief - Sappy features a lyric from Verse Chorus Verse, which may have lead to the conclusion) would have been better. So while every selection was great, if you've gotta overview Nirvana, you need more than one disc./>This is my favorite Nirvana album EVER. And guess what, it's a botched job.

B000002GB9|5.0|I first listened to this album not long after it was released in the mid 70's.  I continue to listen to it on a weekly basis.  Maybe it's the things we did back when we were teens, when we played this album over and over.  But somehow, it just rocks on.
0596007124|5.0|I am software engineer and have read the Gang of Four book on design patterns. This book puts the Gang of Four in perspective in a pleasurable, easy to read context. The examples are in Java and provide easy to follow code. I think the best take away with this book is noticing when to use a particular pattern and then referencing the Gang of Four book as a catalog. I like that they caution the reader to make sure that not everything looks like a design pattern after reading this book (Typical hammer scenario, where everything looks like a nail). I have not read other Head First books, but would be encouraged to read them as the style is a fun easy to follow format - pictures, diagrams, silliness. This also makes the book information easier to recall than some more stodgy perspective. Fun Book.
B000002C2E|5.0|So Bob Dylan went into a dry period in the 80's musically, releasing such albums as 'Shot of Love', 'Infidels' and those crappy religious ones. So in the 90's at a time when he was pretty much considered past it, and recieving life-time achievement awards and such, he produces 1997's Time Out of Mind. What a comeback! Now my favourite album of all time is 'Blood on the Tracks' so while it's not that good its bloody close. 'Blood on the Tracks' displaced 'Blonde on blonde' in my top 5 (yes I'm sad, ever since reading 'high fidelity', top 5 lists have been prominent in my life). So I bought this album whilst already a big Dylan fan.  <br />       I must admit i put this Cd in my player and was a bit sceptical at first, his voice sounds so different to that of his 60's albums that I love so much. So I played on and it struck me how brilliantly the voice sounded older and wiser and befitted an album that was so full of lyrics that told of lonelyness and regret. Its inspiring. I do urge you to go buy some Dylan albums, start with Highway 61 revisited but don't wait to long before you buy this. I'm only 19 and yet I can already feel what he is saying here. <br />      Standout tracks for me are 'Not Dark Yet'  and 'Make you feel my love' both have a tinge of sadness about them yet also hope, which is refreshing, even his masterworks cannot claim to be both- look at Like a Rolling Stone...harsh and brilliant though it is. well I've probably said enough, I'm going to do what I read someone does when listening to Blonde on blonde, lie on the floor, turn the volume up and close my eyes, for 70 blissful minutes, then i'll put this on and be reminded that Bob Dylan is still a force to be reckoned with and rejoice in the fact that thers more to come!
B000AL730O|2.0|While Paul's latest is considerably better than Driving Rain, <br />that's not saying much. I found 9 of the 13 tracks listenable, the other 4 boring. Of the listenables, there is nothing \\"Great\\" as you would expect at least something great on every album. When the best material is just OK or not bad, to me, that constitutes a sub-par McCartney album. <br />What became of the \\"man of a thousand voices\\"? Paul is down to 1 or 2. Paul needs a reminder of what Ringo wrote (and sang) 35 years ago - \\"Get yourself together now and give me something tasty; everything you try to do, you know it sure sounds wasted.\\" <br />While this album may be Paul and sounds like Paul, Beatle Paul is not present.
0553573403|5.0|Two friends of mine kept bugging me, \\"Read Martin!\\" but I was skeptical. I'm not a typical fantasy reader. All the swords and sorcery stuff usually bores me. I've tried on numerous occasions to put a dent in Jordan's first book but usually I fall asleep or my mind wanders. Give me King, Gaiman, De Lint, Tolkien, Keyes, Fforde, and Salvatore... any of these guys and I'm a happy man. But I try to stay away from straight D&D fantasy. \\"He's not like that,\\" they told me.<br /><br />Then, A Game of Thrones came in to our bookstore with a special price of $3.99. So I bought it. I'm a sucker for a good deal!<br /><br />Now, a few weeks later, I've finished it. And HOLY CRAP! That was GOOD! It was better than good it was GREAT! The characters are rich and fantastic and devious and wonderful and heart-breaking and maddening. This is character-driven fantasy. There are no huge plot points that are not created by the characters' interaction. Whether they are warring, backstabbing, screwing, avenging... everything in this book is driven by an amazing cast of characters. I found myself taking my time but wanting to know what happened next so damn bad my slow reading pace was killing me. Also, there are hints at things in side stories and small glimpses of what to come. And I can't wait! I'm going to take a small break from Martin but I've already bought Clash of Kings and can't wait to leap back in.<br /><br />If you've been hemming and hawing about reading his books, stop, and read them. You will not be let down.
B000AP04FG|5.0|This movie is not perfect, but I gave it 5 stars because it was so fun to watch! The movie is filled with a powerful sense of lust and chemistry between Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Add some violence and a bit of humor to this formula, and you get pure entertainment. The attraction between Pitt and Jolie feels completely real---unlike anything I have ever seen in a movie before, and that alone makes this movie worth watching.
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|Yeah I know -  I hate them too. The ones claiming FF7 is the best game ever. While the game was extremly fun and interesting - I, like most, was frustrated with all the loop-holes in the story. However, alittle googling can bring great rewards. After seeing the movie; I was once again frustrated as to what was happening. This game (and now movie) has a hard time actually explaining whats going on.. everything moves too fast and has vague dialog writing. This is where a fanbase site/community comes into handy. I realised that my lacking of what \\"Jenova\\" is, was the key reason why I couldn't figure this movie out... or the game, for that matter. However, I found this site: [...] - best site ever for FF7 information. I read through the entire thing, each section and finally understood FF7 MUCH clearer now. After finally getting a grasp of the events that took place in FF7 and now taking place in Advent Children - the storyline as a whole is very fun and deep. This is the type of storyline where you actually have to do some digging to figure out whats going on - and to fill in the gaps. <br /> <br />The movie was stunning. While alittle corney at times (due to all the \\"fighting in the air\\" anime style - and the overuse of \\"bullet-time\\" slowing down effect) it still pulls off as an action-packed, jaw-dropping CGI movie. This is a movie you watch 3 or 4 times to see everything. It's very fast pace and sometimes (specially with subtiles) you will miss a lot of things - things that are important to the storyline. The battling scenes give off an epic-feeling - 'specially the ending battle between Cloud and Sephrioth. Reno and Rude were my favorite characters in the movie. They make themselves out to be so bad-ass - but get there butt's kicked throughout the entire movie... until the end, when they get the last laugh. <br /> <br />Whether your a fan or not - its worth a watch; whether by download or not, its worth the watch. The CGI alone will blow you away. If you have a loud system (or some good headphones, that are clear) this movie is very intense, the sound FX are clear and loud, and the music is dynomite. You will be lost if you have never played the game or done research to its storyline. Consider yourself warned. <br />
B0001CCXGG|3.0|The trio (JS, SV and YM) was in a complete shape in their show at Boston in 2003. But still, the package wasn't perfect as it was in G3 when Johnson was playing. It is true that Eric is uncharismatic but his guitar tune and uncompetitive rythym led to a Perfect package along with Steve and Joe. Yngwie is more into speed guitar rather than ryhtmic and fusional tunes(as johnson is). Yngwie's songs were not all good to listen to, meanwhile all of joe's songs were good(As usual). Although the last 3 songs played by the trio were good, they weren't as great as in the original G3. Speed doesn't guarantee a perfect play. To note that at FLEET PAVILION, another G3 is still in bootleg(can't imagine why there is no official release) where John Petrucci, Steve and Joe were playing. There Play was better than this G3 but conspicuously less perfect than the original G3.
B00003CXHJ|5.0|I found this to be an exciting and suspenseful story. I've read the book and the movie follows the book exactely.
B000003TA4|5.0|So Nirvana may not be as great as the \\"legendary\\" status suggests, but \\"Nevermind\\" is a great album nonetheless. Many songs that are a great listen! You just have to get over all the noise people make about them and see that they are just a decent band from the early 90's.
B000ANVQ0K|3.0|Before I start, I find hilarous that the person who gave the product a 1 has some nerve telling the company that's releasing the DVD set not to do so! Excuse me, but YOU do not work for Paramount or Fox, and you have NO say into telling the people that work for both companies what they should and shouldn't do. Honestly, it's funny how so many people late their hate for this movie blind them by writing crap like this guy has! I do not care if people don't like the movie, we all have differing opinions and sure a lot of non-fans can justify what they dislike the film but just posting the crap this guy has is again, hilarous. <br /> <br />I would like to say to the person who said that the DVD will be the exact same thing as the standard edition is wrong. The 1998/1999 DVD does not contain a anamorphic enchancement and does not have very *high* quality audio, although it's quite good. In this DVD you will get an anamorphic enchancement and very high-quality audio with a lot extras as well. However if you have a region-free DVD player or a hacked one that can play a certain region or all and has the ability to change from NTSC and PAL or vice versa, buy the deluxe set. Just a suggestion if you want the ultimate edition of Titanic.  <br />
B00025ETIW|5.0|Previously, I never imagined myself liking this type of music, but I found that nearly all the songs on this album are really good! The songs that I like best are Helena, Ghost of You, and Thank you for the Venom. The songs are very energetic and great for running =)
B000AL730O|2.0|I first want to state I own every McCartney release. He has certainly been prolific since the Beatles.I have always been frustrated as to why paul always performs the same songs live and never takes a risk or believes strongly in his own material. His commercial slide began when he teamed up with Michael Jackson.He has been inconsistant since 1984.Since then he has written some fine songs, but he doesn't showcase them.  I personally believe that Kicked Around No More (CD single B-Side?? from Off The Ground) and Somedays on Flaming Pie are his best songs since his Beatle days. I enjoyed  several tracks on Driving Rain, most of which he didn't even bother to include on his last tour. After seeing his performance at the 9/11 benefit in NYC (including the aweful song, Freedom )I thought his voice was shot. I went to the show at Nassau Coliseum on Long Island, not knowing what to expect and was suprised at how he seemed to rebound. The show was so good, I scalped tickets to two more show at MSG.  Paul has lost his muse and he needs someone to tell him when his material is weak and his ego gets too big. I was disgusted when he embarrased himself trying to change the credits on Lennon / Mccartney songs.  The songs on the new record are disappointing, the lyrics painful at times; nothing that interesting after all the hype. It's not the end of the world, it's only a record .I still have plenty of great McCartney music to listen to. Chaos will quickly fade away.   He can't sell records anymore.He should have given  a copy of the new record with each ticket to fans who paid exorbitant prices to see him perform on his new tour, like Prince did with the benefit of the giveaways helping him on the charts. He's a billionaire after all.  I am going to see him three shows in NY, but I no longer have the excitement of previous tours.  Finally, if he wants help with lyrics, he should call Billy Falcon in Nashville who is peerless at lyrics.    P.S. I will be wearing a leather belt tothe show
B000ASATWQ|4.0|This is a great record, but let's not call it a reggae record, because it's not.  This is Jamaican music, but just isn't reggae.  I would say there are MAYBE 3 songs on this album you could classify as reggae.  That's not a bad thing, it's just what it is and I've been able to really appreciate the album once I stopped looking for a reggae album.  Every song offers something a little different and almost every song on the album is worthwhile.  Standouts so far:  Road to Zion, There for You, We're Gonna Make It and Pimpa's Paradise.  Also, to the reviewer who thinks Stephen Marley and Ziggy Marley are one and the same; WRONG!  Stephen Marley is Ziggy Marley's younger brother and a member of the \\"Melody Makers\\", Ziggy's band.
B000AADYYO|2.0|Too much synth, too much awkward clean singing, not enough metal. Don't want to call them sellouts, but they have definitely taken their music in a whole new direction under Roadrunner's management.
6305095442|5.0|Depending on what your mood and company is, this movie can be seen a raucous black comedic romp or a very effective pieces of edgy weird horror. I see very few movies more than once and in general am not a fan of horror, but I have seen this movie about 5 times to show it to different people. Its visuals are quirky and experimental but rich and almost everything works though some things are obviously tongue in cheek. Whether you are in a mood for comedy or horror this movie will not let you down. The only proviso I add is if you have a low tolerance for gore, shock or intense weirdness this movie will probably be too much for you. P.S. A fun game you can play with the movie is trying to count the number of times the lead charecter Ash gets hit in the head.
B000AJJNPY|1.0|Extremely irritating.<br /><br />This new CD from Sigur Ros was played in my workplace for a week. I am glad that week is over. This CD was juxtaposed Cecilia Bartoli's new 'Opera Proibita' CD, which was simply magnificent and daring. Sigur Ros sounded like some strange bit of nonsense from the tail-end of old fashioned TwenCen ambient music.<br /><br />When Takk first came on the CD player, I listened with some interest. I hadn't heard much Sigur Ros before and I was genuinely curious. However, after hearing this recording quite a few times I have to say that it is simply an irritating noise that starts, lingers for a while and then stops.<br /><br />If you want to get an idea of what this album generally sounds like imagine a teenager on a bus with an i-pod turned up so loud that you can hear it. The ambient music is distorting. Unaware that other people can hear him, this teenager sings, or should I say moans, along with the music. This is actually what this album sounds like.<br /><br />One of my colleagues mentioned that the singing reminded him of his cat.<br /><br />Caterwauling, is generally the word we would use for such unmusical noises.<br /><br />Be warned! If you love music and expressive, interesting, purposeful, daring, competent, intellectual, colourful, exciting and engaging music, look elsewhere!<br /><br />Yes, extremely irritating.
1573226521|4.0|The book is in great condition.  However, when I ordered the book they promised two to three business days and it took almost two weeks.  I needed this book for school and if I had known it was going to tak this long I would have gone to the bookstore.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|First off...this album is great.  I think it's the Foo Fighters best so far.  The problem I have is that the company that made this CD is violating our right to Fair Use. The Fair Use Act guarantees us the right to create back-ups of CDs/DVDs that we purchase legally, so that in the event that the original is damaged, we don't have to buy another copy.  You cannot back this CD up because of the stupid program installed on the disk that automatically runs when you insert it.  For information on how to remove this \\"SPYWARE\\" that is installed, you can find articles on the internet.  This is a violation of our rights.  I urge people to fight against this.  Write your representatives and let them know you won't stand for this.  While your at it write the record company and send them a copy of the Fair Use Act.
B000AL730O|5.0|This album is very evocative of Macca's first solo album, and alot of the songs do remind me of when he was with his band Wings. In the song Fine Line, if you imagine it, you can almost hear Linda singing in the background. Exellent job Macca!! <br />He's the last of a dying breed. Let's hope he's around forever! <br />
B00068NVI4|4.0|The good:  The concert is well paced, song selection is fantastic with too many highlights to name, the band is mostly \\"on\\" with particularly excellent bass work throughout, Jon is in fine voice, elegant Roger Dean stage, ...     The not so good...:     video - I understand that, for \\"Symphonic\\" they did not film the first night in Amsterdam and the lighting was different to optimize filming of the second show on November 22, 2001.  That crew got the lighting and filming right IMHO.  On Tsongas, the filming fails to capture the elegance of the stage and the lighting of the two shows I caught in 2004.  There are constant washes of blues that often obscure much of what is happening on stage.     sound -  There are few excuse for producing DVDs with anything but impeccable sound given today's technologies. The PBS site states \\"...SOUNDSTAGE has been reborn! The production uses state of the art high-definition video equipment, and is digitally recorded and mixed in Dolby 5.1\\"  However, compared to the dts track on Symphonic or, for example, the excellent Boz Scaggs Greatest Hits and ELO's Zoom, Tsongas falls below today's standards.  (With \\"Zoom\\", listening to the dts track is like standing on stage next to Jeff Lynn.)  When I read others' feedback my first thought was that, in contrast to Symphonic, Tsongas must default to 5.1 and that other reviewers were not adjusting their receiver accordingly if their unit did not perform this automatically.  Wrong!  In fact, when I listened to the dts track, I thought that someone had fooled around with the DVD player and inadvertantly changed the setting from bitstream.  I then put in Symphonic to make sure it wasn't the system.  Nope!  Switching from LPCM to 5.1 seems like someone draped a sheet over the speakers and switching to dts was yet another sonic step down.  I also found Alan White often much too low in the mix and JA a tad too high.      Yes remain my favourite band  but listening to Tsongas in LPCM using our receiver's \\"concert hall\\" setting is not what I had in mind but to my ears this is the best option for me.  One might argue that such a setting more closely approximates being at the show than does DD5.1 or dts.  I recall reading that, with Symphonic, Alan White was so thrilled with the outcome his enthusiasm prompted him to call his bandmates...   I understand his enthusiasm and when friends come over to check out the system I most often use Symphoni for the demo.  Given the DVD's put out by other artists as well as the stellar YES Symphonic, IMHO, 5 stars would not give users of this forum a fair nor accurate benchmark.  However, the good easily eclipses the not-so-good and Tsongas is a must have for fans and I anticipate enjoying it for some time to come.
B0000027RL|5.0|C'mon give me a break.....This album not good...I dare any grunge lover to say this....c'mon man this is one of the most brilliant starts a band can get...And ya if anyone doubts Eddie's Song writing skills my only words of wisdom are-F*** You...And I read a kiddo saying the lyrics(particularly Alive) are not meaningful.This shows his immaturity...ofcourse he's a kid and wont understand the lyrics perhaps he may want to know the song was written as a trilogy consisting of Alive,Once and Footsteps...and the lyrics are bout a boy and his troubled childhood(In alive),his rage and crimes(in once) and then his execution(In footsteps)...C'mon man you doubt Eddie's lyrics....The one thing a person can be sure of is impressive in Pearl JAmis Eddie's Lyrics....Hear Elderly Woman....Hear Release....Hear Deep....Hear Better Man...Hear Immortality....Black (The Lyrics are simply mindblowing for your kind information...now dont say they are not meaningful)...Hear Even Flow....Love Boat Captain... and i dont find ny of Eddie's Lyrics un-meaningful....But ofcourse thats my opinion... a die hard fan of pearl jam
6304806434|4.0|For some reason this movie didn't do well in the theatres, however I'd have to say that it's one of the best action movies that has been made in recent times.  Sure the \\"prisoner gets a chance to do good\\" premise isn't the most original, however Nicholas Cage pulls off an entertaining performance with a lot of quality stunts and great effects.
B000000WJZ|5.0|A Masterpiece....Simply Mind Blowing...Man I am at a loss for words....Simply amazing...I mean the lyrics,guitars,bass,drums everything...The Beautiful 'Disarm' is worth the price alone....Whenever i listen to it and reach to the path where he utters 'A Killer in you is a killer in me' I always get Goosebumps...Man They rock.....Definitely an album which is going to mark The Pumpkins' name in golden letter in the history of music
0307120007|2.0|I gave this book to my daughter for her first birthday.  Due to the cheap binding, she took it apart on the first day!  The pages inside are interesting, so I'll give it two stars for that.
B0009SOFGI|5.0|The new remastered version is 100% worth the money.  The sound, the extras, and the liner notes are all great.  The extras include some cool versions where they don't fade out Ron Asheton's extended wailing guitar solos.  They just let him jam for a minute or longer than on the originals.  That's exactly what I wanted, because it's his guitar that I really love.  I agree with the other reviewer who said that this albums sound beats the pants off of the old version.
B00008PC2O|2.0|Okay... <br /> <br />I love T2...Five stars on the film. I crave the special edition cut...even better than the theatrical. <br /> <br />BUT HELL PEOPLE! With 3 different DVD versions of the film, which do you buy?? <br /> <br />Sure as you can guess, don't buy the single DVD edition. But don't you dare buy the EXTREME DVD version Artisan pushed out. What crap. Seriously. Special features are the commentary, a lameo interactive piece that plays a long with the film, 2 short documentaries, and a trailer for the better, ULTIMATE EDITION. Oh yeah...and if you like to watch movies on the computer, you can watch the theatrical version on WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER. <br /> <br />Seriously...where do people get off packaging a DVD like this? The special features are sorely lacking here. <br /> <br />Lastly...this lame metal case tears the spine of the DVD case to shreds. Piss poor, Artisan. Now I'm out to hunt for the Ultimate Edition.
B000062YAZ|5.0|It's funny how you say that us Slayer fans were duped, yet you very next sentence was \\"I just bought a Slayer CD\\".  Which tells me that yourself was also duped.<br /><br />Comparing Slayer to Slipknot is probably the most retarded and ridiculous thing I have ever heard..I would really like to see some one manage to show any type of comparison between the two.  I don't recall anytime I have EVER heard or seen of Slayer dressing up in some kind of outrageous makeup or masks to try and extend their image.<br /><br />They have had almost zero air time on radios and zero time on MTV, and yet they have still held a very loyal fanbase throughout the last 20-some years, and will continue to do so until well after they stop making muic.<br /><br />Now \\"Elitest\\", I can see why Slayer's music would upset you, being a very religious person, most likely a christian, seeing as how they are the majority of the people who bash Slayer for their \\"Satanic\\" lyrics.<br /><br />And \\"Eli-testicles\\" also claims that Metallica and and Megadeth are far superior musicians..but take a look now and see who has survived through the past decades, staying true to their music and not selling out to \\"MTV\\" and \\"Radio friendly\\" music.  After the dust clears there is only one still standing and that is Slayer.
B000AL730Y|5.0|I wrote a review for the regular album, which I love, and the 5 star rating is for the actual CD.   <br /> <br />So this review is mainly to talk about the DVD that comes with this edition.  The main reason it's worth it is for the \\"making of\\" special that is a half-hour long.  I don't think it goes into things as much as it could, and in a way it feels like a promotional piece that would be designed to get people to buy it (in fact, VH-1 showed this as a TV special recently).  But it is still cool to see Paul in the studio working on these songs and giving some background info on them.  One thing I think is great about Paul is how unpretentious he is about talking about the craft of songwriting.  He admits that he doesn't even really know where his inspiration comes from, just something magical that happens.  And he really sounds like even after all these years he is still appreciative, even humbled, by the joy his music brings to his fans. <br /> <br />The video for \\"Fine Line\\" reminds me of the old video for \\"Coming Up\\" where he is shown playing all the different instruments from different camera angles.  It's fun to watch, but you can tell from the documentary that they made more than one of these videos - I might sound greedy but it would've been cool to see more of these. <br /> <br />The \\"line art\\" thing was just sort of boring and I didn't finish watching it.  Basically, three of the songs play in instrumental versions while the camera pans around the artwork from the CD booklet.  It's not animated or anything, just the still drawings from the booklet.  I won't go back to that anytime soon.
0393317552|4.0|I found this book highly insightful and visionary. In the sense that this man took so much of his time to write a \\"true\\" novel of human societies and existence, one not biased or racist,and one knows how difficult a feat that is!I read on occassion, in spurts, since I work alot and spend alot of time with my family on off time as well.I spent a couple of years in a simple business college. My point being that I am certainly not on the in-depth level in any sort of scientific field, and yet I found the novel to be somewhat difficult in certain areas yet so worthwhile to read through the \\"tough\\" chapters and to be awarded with a view changing (life view altering) chapter!!! This book certainly helped to broaden my understanding of humanities being,evolution,as well as todays people, of course in the broadest historical sense. People complain that he (Diamond) wasnt detailed enough, I say \\"short & sweet\\", I got his point and essentially just filled in many of the blanks myself. If you are in high school as one of the reviewer's mentioned then maybe you do not quite yet have the patience necessary to understand or want to understand of novel such as this. Thank you Mr.Diamond for your love , it shows in your writings!!
B000AL730O|5.0|It's not like there's a rule saying \\"Paul McCartney\\" must rock out every time he releases something new.  A lot of his albums don't have much, if any, true rock music.  In the Billboard special issue covering this release, Paul says in an interview that he decided early on this wasn't going to be a rock album, but instead a \\"whatever it is\\" album.  So yeah, it's quiet and somber and mostly down-tempo.   <br /> <br />That's fine with me, I have been getting into this CD more with every listen.  About Paul's singing voice, if you think he doesn't sound quite like he did in 1975 it's because nobody retains their youthful voice for their whole life.  Where have these fans been for the past 20 years?  Paul's voice started declining seriously around the mid-to-late '80s.  His early '90s live recordings could be a little painful to listen to at times.  Around the late '90s, his voice started recovering for some reason.  Whatever caused it, I'm very glad because starting with \\"Flaming Pie\\" and continuing ever since, Paul seems back in control of his voice for the most part.  It's never going to sound like it did 30 or 40 years ago.  But on this album his voice is front and center, even if it means revealing a slight straining to reach high notes.  That's better to me than hearing it buried in mix and altered by studio effects like it often was in the late '80s/early '90s era. <br /> <br />Highlights... <br /> <br />\\"Friends To Go\\" is an awesome song.  I guess I can see the George influence everyone (including Paul) is talking about, but if no one ever brought it up I'd still love this song.  I just love the idea of this isolationist hiding out, perfectly content to be alone.  A classic. <br /> <br />\\"How Kind of You\\" is like a very sad \\"thank you\\" note to someone.  Paul sounds like he's in a bit of daze, conveying the gratefulness of the lyrics but without any trace of the happy-go-lucky Paul we're used to.  I like the low-register voice he uses on this. <br /> <br />\\"Too Much Rain\\" is just another classic.  I like the optimism in the lyrics and the genuine feeling Paul invests in them.  The falsetto voice he uses to sing the title line is delivered perfectly.  And I can still hear a little sadness in the song, which deepens it so much more than I think Paul would've done if it had come out years ago.  It's like he's acknowledging, without literally saying, that he knows life isn't easy or carefree. <br /> <br />Those are just a few of my favorite songs on the cd.  One thing about the cd I thought was odd, while Paul plays almost all the instruments himself, there is a drummer brought in for \\"At the Mercy\\" and \\"Riding to Vanity Fair\\".  The funny thing is, the drumming on these two tracks is nothing Paul couldn't have handled himself.  Just struck me as odd, also that a guitarist plays on a couple tracks but isn't (as far as I can hear) featured in any significant way.   <br /> <br />
B0006213WG|4.0|\\"Chuck,\\" a (suprise surprise) politically driven album which stays its ground in its ambiguity. For those of you that enjoy the perks of a backstory to their listening experience: The Canadian pop-punk quartet named their album in honor of United Nations peacekeeper Chuck Pelletier, who escorted Sum 41 safely to a U.N. compound when gunfire erupted outside their hotel during their humanitarian visit to the Congo in late May of 2004. Deryck told Chuck if they made it out alive, they would name the album after him. I'm sure it was inaudible girlish shrieking to Chuck's ears, and he is probably unaware at this time of his tribute, but nonetheless it's a pretty interesting concept. \\"How is the album, Andrew?\\" you may ask. \\"I need your opinion of the album because I cannot rely on the inconsistencies of my own musical tastes, Andrew!\\" you may declare. Relax...In advance, I give you Sum 41's \\"Chuck.\\" <br /> <br />1. Intro - Slow guitar chords are strummed while layered with more intricate picking. As much as I would like to grade an intro, I refuse to let the rest of the album sway in my rating by letting a 46 second clip get included. I will incorporate this into \\"No Reason.\\" So my rating for \\"Intro\\" will be declared N/A. <br /> <br />2. No Reason - The intro leads well into hard punching power chords and shouting by Deryck Whibley, \\"All of us believe/ That this is not up to you/ The fact of the matter is/ That it's up to me.\\" \\"Hey, hey, hey's\\" line a decent drum pattern and a rhythm which could definetly be impressive live as well. The song is essentially placing responsibility on the population for making change when things are the way we would like. The chorus, I'll just say, is catchy as all hell. A great intro with nothing but what is expected of a hard rock/pop/metal/punk band like Sum 41. Driving verses build up to a chorus which you're humming to yourself after the first listen regardless of the fact that you can't quite remember the words. Sum 41 in a nutshell,my friends. It's a great song, and perhaps all that it lacks is ingenuity and the extra kick the boys need to progress to the next level. This is only the start of \\"Chuck,\\" though, and it's quite the start. A- <br /> <br />3. We're All to Blame - The first single off of \\"Chuck\\" is an agressive thrash at our own faults for the American tragedy. Impressive approach lyrically, and the change ups from metal riffs and vocals into a soft, slow-tempo chorus. The chorus starts out with a simple guitar effect in parallel with Deryck's vocals into an anthemic, soaring composition of harmonies and rhythm. Extremely catchy, but borderline rip off. If System of a Down's \\"Chop Suey\\" had never been released then this could be leaning on originality. The change ups and tempos are very similar toward's Serj's and the boy's first big hit. Aside from these irritations, \\"We're All to Blame\\" is a great effort, and deserves its place on \\"Chuck.\\" B <br /> <br />4. Angels With Dirty Faces - Deryck begins with somber vocals behind slow guitar strumming. Of course, this changes within the first 20 seconds. \\"Angels\\" is a song which attacks the corruption within oneself. \\"Obsession had begun/ Possessed by destruction,\\" Whibley shouts. Short, hard, slightly different from what Sum 41 has done in the past due to the fact that there are quick pauses in which Whibley sings in utter silence for 4 seconds before the Steve-O and Dave pound into another fast-paced section. Much like \\"*******\\" off of their last album and \\"Never Wake Up\\" off its previous, \\"Angels\\" is their hard, relentless two minute song which always winds up within the first four tracks of a Sum 41 album. Call it filler, call it a developed pattern, but it manages to stand on its own. B- <br /> <br />5. Some Say - Deryck begins singing with a mid-tempo recording reversed (ala Somewhere I Belong - Linkin Park). When hearing this song, I'm reminded of \\"Handle This,\\" off of All Killer No Filler. Same rhythm and structure, particularly inthe chorus, with a few extra touches such as the verse arrangements. Unique effects and rhythm accompany Deryck's vocals, seperating it from its comparisons to past work. The funny thing is that it's also taking a similar tone lyrically as \\"Handle This,\\" except instead of the chorus saying \\"Cause I will bring you down/ I don't wanna miss/ I don't think you can handle this,\\" Sum 41 is declaring, \\"Think before you make up your mind/ You don't seem to realize/ I can do this on my own.\\" Perhaps Sum could have taken a note from Metallica and called it Handle This 2, but if they did that they would have to call their album \\"St. Chuck,\\" and actually suck balls. It's risky territory, and I'm ranting way too much. More than filler, less than exceptional, entirely acceptable. B <br /> <br />6. The Bitter End - Great intro. They've really got the metal influence shining through the beginning of this song. Fast foot work by Steve-O compliments the thrashing riffs of Dave. There's even some decent solo work by Dave throughout the entire song. This is a perfect example of why Sum 41 is one of the most popular punk rock bands, yet they are highly underrated. Coming and going before overstaying its welcome, \\"The Bitter End\\" grabs a hearty B <br /> <br />7. Open Your Eyes - This song began without taking me off guard. It was almost hard to discern the beginning of this track from a continuation from \\"The Bitter End,\\" but Sum 41 decided to step it up. Deryck thrusts quick lyrics in a bouncy verse arrangement - almost reminiscent of Fat Lip but much, much harder. The chorus is, of course, simple and catchy enough you can just picture a Deryck Whibley head bouncing along the lyrics in a Karaoke bar. It's a hard-driven catchy peice of work. It's Sum 41. B+ <br /> <br />8. Slipping Away - Very interesting and long overdue: Sum 41 has gone acoustic. Deryck's vocals are distorted in the intro which can be best compared to the Deftones. The chorus even bring strings into the picture. Catchy, somber, and it's different to say the least. A great effort by the band, but a little on the short side. Clocking in at about 2:30, the songs ends before it starts. It's as if the boys want to try something soft, but not enough to make a dent in their set list. Based on this song, that's a potential shame. B+ <br /> <br />9. I'm Not the One - The verses made me nervous in this song. Deryck's vocals reminded me of the verse of Limp Bizkit's \\"Nookie,\\" but of course there a driving, punk-like chorus which dismisses any notion of Sum 41 ripping off another genre (slight sarcasm). Decent effort, but nothing to bring up while playing poker with the guys. B- <br /> <br />10. Welcome to Hell - Quick punching song which leans more on the side of some of Sum's punk counterparts like NOFX, Lagwagon, or Pennywise. I was surprised to hear some quick finger-picking by Cone on the bass, and of course it's nice to hear a pure punk effort on this album. Short of noteworthy, yet packs a decent offering into this album. B <br /> <br />11. Peices - Another power ballad by the group. Surprisingly, some of the bands slower efforts on \\"Chuck,\\" are the ones which have shined the most. \\"Peices\\" has some half-assed rhymes in it, but the simplicity of their catchy chorus is more concentrated by a new approach by the band, as well as some decent verses lyrically. Overall a commendable little number. B+ <br /> <br />12. There's No Solution - Hearty filler in the guise of Linkin Park's \\"Numb.\\" C+ <br /> <br />13. 88 - Creative change ups and catchy everything. This is a preferred direction for Sum 41. Try and avoid nodding your head at the bridge. They accomplish a mainstream appeal while trying something totally different. Sounds a tad bittersweet, but entirely enjoyable. Great way to end the album, especially due to the jam at the end. This is a song which keeps me buying Sum 41 albums upon each release. A
0385512058|3.0|So Keith went to a prestigious school. He repeats this over and over again from beginning to end. His book is 65% personal stories of meeting other VIPs, MBAs and PhDs, which could be motivational but leaves the reader in want to be inspired. <br />Keith apparently has no family ties or obligations, no spouse, no children, no parents to take care of. (Ironic when you reach the Health, Wealth and Children chapter.)  He writes as if every other business man or woman is in the same care-free state of living as he.  His life is \\"pinging\\" with colleagues and VIPs and making appointments 24/7 with as many prestigious and pedigreed people as possible and if he can't reach them, try the gateway lady (aka Admin. Assistant) because her only importance is her connection to the CEO. BTW, he never mentions taking the Admin. out to lunch. <br />He defends his way of living by saying that being balanced is B.S. I guess if you don't have a life either, by all means, have your lavish dinners and ping away.

B0009KA7BS|3.0|The premise behind Constantine is terrific. A downbeat cynic with a grudge against his creator is given the power to help maintain the balance between good and evil on earth in an effort to \\"buy\\" his way into heaven.  That says a lot since most of us who do have faith pray with basically selfish motives, then act as though we're doing it to glorify God. Also, I thought the concept of Constantine's smoking captured mankind's affection for spite in a very clever and funny way. Add to that the idea of \\"half-breeds\\" living among us and \\"the wager\\", and this movie is, theologically, darn interesting.<br /><br />The problem with Constantine, like so many other big-budget hollywood productions, is that it tries to satisfy all audiences by blending all genres.  Sometimes that works, but not here. Constantine is not scary as a horror movie, and it's humor works more in its recurring gags than its intended comic relief. Granted I never read the comic book, but even if this is a faithful adaptation, a seasoned crew should know what wouldn't work in a transfer to the big screen. Comic relief characters are overused anyway, being that they distract more from the story than they add to it.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves was a good choice for the lead, but the show is nearly stolen by Tilda Swinton's gender-bending Gabriel.  Always classy and fun, Tilda injects the most vitality into Constantine despite her only being present in three scenes! She and Gavin Rossdale appear to be the only ones smart enough to not take their roles too seriously.

B0006L5RT2|5.0|Fabulous fabulous album!  I was on vacation in the south of France in late August 2005 when the \\"You're Beautiful\\" video caught my eye one morning in my hotel room.  I was transfixed . . . mesmerized . . . haunted . . . all the more so after having listened to the full album, so much so that this is the first time I've ever bothered to write a review on anything.  Anyone not moved by some portion of this beautiful album hasn't yet been touched by something/someone who's made their heart both sing and break into a million pieces.
1591391105|4.0|This book is very good at pushing you into action.  I've made many transitions in my career and had previously used my first two weeks on the job as a settling-in period.  90 Days is a wake up call to getting moving early and getting moving fast, or you might spend you're whole first year playing catch-up.  I'm in the middle of another transition and this book really helping me avoid some serious missteps.
B00006LWSF|4.0|I am not much of a rap fan but I do enjoy Eminem albums / songs.  If you like this kind of music and will not be offended with profanity, then this is an album I believe you will enjoy.  If you have seen the movie, then you know what kind of music this soundtrack is.  And if you like the movie, then you appreciate this album.  That's it.  If you are going to purchase this album, have fun because I am.
0440180295|5.0|This book is excellent, and I reccomend it heartily as a novel.   However, the figure of 135,000 to 250,000 killed in the bombing of Dresden is a gross exageration of the true numbers, which were at most 50,000, but probably something like 30,000.   The range 135,00 0 to 250,000 comes from proven Nazi-sympathizer David Irving.  For an account of how he fabricated his information read Lying About Hitler, by Richard Evans.  During the bombing, Vonnegut was housed in an underground facility outside of the city so didn't see the bombing and was involved in the recovery of bodies, so all of his information on the death toll is second hand, which has since he wrote the book been proven false. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, quite worth a read.

B00004RFFI|4.0|It's the special effects that are the star of this megahit; the script and performances are run of the mill, offering nothing extraordinary at all.  But if you like a good disaster film, TWISTER delivers.  Director Jan DeBont(Speed) keeps the action sequences tense and volatile, but the film bogs down when it tries to focus on the failed relationship of stars Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt.  Throw in Jamie Gertz and Cary Elwes in derivative roles as Paxton's new fiancee and his self-absorbed competitor, and you have the ingredients for standard disaster cum personal crises film.  But who can argue with the awesome dynamics of the terrifying twisters; the flying cows; the eighteen wheeler oil tanker, and other SEs which permeate and validify this blockbusting movie, which has the honor of being the first movie released on DVD.
0446310786|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel about prejudice and racism.  The story is about a girl named Scout and her family.  Scout has a lot of normal and interesting experiences which are fun to read.  The story was a smooth read.  Later in the story Scout's father, who is a lawyer, is put in a position where he is to defend an innocent black man.  The tension builds in the story as the town almost lynches the innocent man because of prejudice and racism.  The story is interesting and inspiring.  I recommend this as a must read for anyone looking for a book t about courage and standing up for what is right.  I give this book five stars.

B000AA305M|2.0|My first introduction to David Gray was through White Ladder. I loved the way he combined sparse electro-beats with sweeping melodies and emotional piano riffs. His lyrics spoke of self-doubt, despair and lost chances - subject matter that and I could really relate. \\"Please forgive me\\" was my highlight from this superb collection of songs. <br />\\"A new day at midnight\\" received a luke warm review from the critics, but I think it is Gray's best album to date. There are some fantastic up-tempo tracks like \\"Caroline\\" and some beautiful ballads like \\"Last boat to America.\\" The balance is perfect. <br /> <br />These two albums were not produced in studio and the \\"home made effect\\" gave them a certain charm; slightly rugged, a bit rough yet oozing with character. <br />\\"Life in slow motion\\" has lost this as it was recorded in studio and the result is a rambling collection of overproduced \\"filler.\\" Where are the drum 'n bass inspired beats? I played the CD once and not one song stood out. Not one melody looped over in my mind. Nothing. <br /> <br />This album is a huge let down. I love David Gray, but I will definitely remember him for a his previous albums.

B00005JKC3|1.0|I can't believe there are actually good reviews for this waste of time and money on both the filmakers and their backers AND the tortured theater goers. This in no way had any resemblace to the comic book. Oh, they changed his name back to Bruce.BIG DEAL... The Bixby/Ferrigno TV series is remembered fondly because they (and all others involved) did a great job with their interpretation. Ang Lee,Eric Bana and all others involved did a reprehensible job with their interpretation.Bruce Banner is supposed to be a scientist.Eric Bana couldn't even convince me he barely graduated high school.At least Bill Bixby made me (and millions of others) believe that he knew alot about science and medicine. Now that's great acting.This CGI Hulk didn't look like the hulk at all.Just a big green man. Animatronic would have been the right way to go.I even like the Hulk from the Marvel Superheroes GOT MILK? commercials way better than this. Ang Lee:The Hulk should move rike Diss,ARGGHH.The Hulk should move rike datt,ROARRR.Oh! and Ereek Just say your rines. Da Bruce Banna character is not impawtant. That was the extent of his directorial participation of the film.Near the end of the movie in the rainforest the film finally started to pick up momentum and become intense(probably helmed by a second unit director) if so, he should direct Hulk 2. Then WHAM! End of movie.Even the worst episode of the TV series was far superior to this hunk of trash.Bonus Features? Don't make me laugh.you wouldn't like me when I laugh.Hours and hours of look how much CGI we used, and watching Ang Lee jump around like an idiot in a CGI suit telling the computer people how Hulk should act, and a bunch of cast and crew kiss ass interviews.\\"Oh,Ang Lee is brilliant\\" \\"Oh'Ang Lee has vision\\".The only thing Ang Lee has is an grossly undeserved large bank account. So far the best incarnation of the hulk from the comic book is the 1996 animated series.And I'm STILL waiting for them to get off their dead asses and release the rest of that series. If I were Stan Lee I'd Punch Ang Lee right in the nose.Twice, one; for ruining my creation and two; shaming my last name.
0446677450|5.0|I bouoght this book earlier tonite and read it in a few hours. It is an easy read. Fun. Enjoyable and educational. It made me realize that I threw away many years of commonality, of doing what felt good. What Uncle George and Aunt Martha and cousin Billy and brother Jim told me was the right thing to do, but really wasn't. <br /> <br />I am now setting up a plan of action to go into real estate, the Rich Dad way. Yeah, I know everybody thinks that the real estate game is over and that is because like me they are getting the wrong information from the wrong people. How in the world can you expect people making $50,000-$75,000 year, chained to their employers coat tails to tell you how to become financially independent and earn over $100,000 a year? It doesn't make sense. <br /> <br />This book was very enlightening for me. I highly recommend it. Regarding my real estate plans, I'll let you know how I make out! <br /> <br />
B000AM4PBS|5.0|How can Warner Bro. do this to us?! We have been so loyal and bought every season and now they came out with something that they know we probably will not buy! We put every penny to purchase each season as it comes out and we have stood by FRIENDS every second and supported it ever since the pilot show, but I would have never thought WB would come up with a scandal like this to say loyal fans are stupid to purchase the seasons one by one and should have waited the very last minute. How do you think us fans think about that kind of message? WB should show us the rewards of standing by FRIENDS and not the other way around! Agree fellow FRIENDS watchers?
B0009QTS1M|5.0|This \\"Quintessential\\" Gladiator DVD release has it all. Hours of behind-the-scene extras beautifully crafted with consistency throughout. The extended edition was a real treat, as well as the fresh commentary by Scott & Crowe. The only GLARING omission was the lack of DTS sound track which is only found on the very first DVD release. That was a major disappointment!
0440241413|4.0|I rate this book 4 because, I dont know.. The story is nice! When I first read it 2 years ago, I thought it was a bit shallow. But just recently, because of a friend of mine, I suddenly got into it. I took the book from my book shelf and started reading it. <br /> <br />My god! I couldnt bloody put it down! I love just how Rebecca can get away with things! and of course, Tarquin! =) Who could have thought he had something for Rebecca? Haha! =) I wish Sophie Kinsella and some producers would decide on making a movie on this book series, just like Gossip Girl, by Cecily Von Ziegesar. <br /> <br />WATCH OUT FOR THE UPCOMING SERIES! DEFINITELY A SERIES TO DIE FOR!

1878424319|5.0|I've read a lot of different psychological development books, self help books and classic spirituality texts. The Four Agreements is, by far, the most accessible and simple seeming yet actually very profound. Yes, it seems a little \\"new agey\\", yes it seems too simple to be effective. Yet, in spite of all the systems I've studied it was this little book that helped lift from out of clinical depression and rereading it is always good for a lift. An easy yet not so easy way to reprogram your inner voice or freudian Superego that was drummed into you by society and family.  <br /> <br />To previous reviewers who try to pull some intellecutal high ground and make it seem as ifonly an ingorant or stupid person could enjoy it or benefit from this book .... it's okay. I know you're doing you're best! ;-) <br /> <br />I've bought 3 copies of this book for friends/family members. Also, I've heard the audio version, and Peter Coyote does a terrrific job giving this important message a voice!

B000002H33|5.0|This, along with Slayer's \\"Reign In Blood\\", is one of those albums that simply stands out, something that simply seems to thrum with a life of its own as it sits there in my CD rack, glowing from within with a special kind of light. Most albums are simply that - a collection of songs on a circular piece of plastic. But \\"Master Of Puppets\\" is simply something more...it stands out in way that the Mona Lisa stands out from a group of paintings, a masterwork, something historical, something purely classic, something simply...special. This album, along with \\"Reign In Blood\\", Carcass's \\"Heartwork\\" and Iron Maiden's stunning greatest hits package, \\"Edward The Great\\", is not a CD but a part of me, of my life, something that represents a time in my existence, a period where the music filled my soul and gave me unknown quantities of joy. \\"Master Of Puppets\\" is a devastating, brutal, soul-wrenching musical landmark, something that raised the bar for every other metal band in being on the day it was released to the world. I can think about this album with a tear in my eye...I love it like a brother or sister. The classic, legendary tracks: the ultra-fast, eye-licking, soul-whipping races of \\"Battery\\" and \\"Damage, Inc\\", which bookend the album; the beautiful yet savage dynamics of the title track; the utterly brutal, crushingly heavy \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\"; the breathtaking \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\" which pulls at the heartstrings in a way no modern, cheesy power ballad ever could; the throbbing \\"Disposable Heroes\\"; the gut-punching chug of \\"Leper Messiah\\"; and of course the Cliff Burton's searing farewell to the world, the mind-blowing instrumental \\"Orion\\". <br />Ok, so the production sounds muted and dated by today's standards, but SO WHAT? With music like this, it just doesn't matter how cheap or shoddy the production job is - the true inspiration behind it can shine through anyway. The drums and guitar still sound unbelievable - Kirk Hammett's solos blend melody and tastefulness with a shreddy, head-banging quality; Hetfield growls like a bear, backed up by his intense rhythm guitar-playing; the godlike Cliff provides simply some of the best bass-work heavy metal has ever known, truly making sure his last album on this earth would be his best; and good ole Lars sure pounds the life out of the skins. <br />\\"Master Of Puppets\\" is a reminder of what made the '80s the best decade in metal ever - crunching, head-banging intensity, combined with a true youthful lust for life, something that makes you know how genuine and passionate these guys were about simply playing the music that they loved. \\"Master Of Puppets\\" is not a mere collection of music - in my eyes, to my ears, it is a milestone in history and a veritable work of art.
B00080Z53O|4.0|\\"The Sea Inside\\" achieves something many foreign films don't: it translates well. So much so that English speakers could forget they're watching a film in Spanish. The English subtitles manage to capture the poetry of the film's Spanish script, with such lines as \\"I refuse to give in to the inertia where I can only be thankful for what I've been given because I have no other choice than to accept it,\\" as spoken by supporting character Julia (Belen Rueda), who faces a degenerative disease. And for Spanish speakers or the bilingual, the DVD allows you to change the subtitles to Spanish, and the Spanish subtitles are actually the same as the spoken dialogue. (Often DVDs will put in Spanish subtitles that don't match the spoken language exactly, but here that's not the case.) <br /> <br />The DVD features a director commentary in Spanish (unfortunately with no subtitles) and excellent deleted scenes that fill in some of the holes regarding the story of Ramon's lawyer/friend Julia. <br /> <br />The editing and cinematography is first-rate. In a montage, the quadriplegic Ramon, played by Javier Bardem, recalls how his life flashed before his eyes when he was injured; meanwhile Julia, his lawyer/friend, looks through photographs of his past in another room. <br /> <br />The story moves quickly with slices of humor, irony, and tragedy in a film that breaks the cookie-cutter euthanasia narrative. Bardem brings a great complexity to his portrayal of Ramon in one of the most astonishing performances in years. This film has great universal appeal, but is also perfect for someone who has ever been injured for a long time or permanently, or for someone who knows or cares for someone in such a state. It brings humanity not only to euthanasia, but also to sickness and/or injury. <br /> <br />
0385335482|3.0|A cute Bridget Diaries type fable.  A little too sweet, fantasy, happy ending kind of story, but still worth a few page turns on a subway.

B000268QB2|5.0|Keane, a British Pop artist with some musical resemblance to Coldplay, has released the best British Pop album of 2004 with 'Hopes and Fears', a confident album of passionate proportions. To their credit, they depart from Coldplay's guitar chords and sometimes lyrical repetitiveness to create an album that speaks volumes about love in a fragile world. The most stunning tracks here are 'Somewhere Only We Know', 'Bend and Break', 'We Might As Well Be Strangers' (my personal favorite), and 'Bedshaped' (a VERY close second), for their soaring vocals and catchy hooks and superb delivery. Some songs grow on you over time, like 'Can't Stop Now' and 'She Has No Time'. They may never reach superstar status and fill up stadiums like their distant cousin Coldplay, but they are definitely destined to have a strong, solid fanbase in the mold of Robbie Williams, a legendary British artist who may soon pass the \\"legendary\\" label to Keane. They are indeed destined legends after one listen of this fine, remarkable debut album.

B0006399FS|5.0|U2 is famous for being a visionary band in a rock music world that doesn't like to take risks and stand out with a distinctive sound, and it shows in all its glory on 'How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb'. The album is a graceful, ambitious, and epic execution of rock style and substance, never straying away from U2's signature soaring guitar chords and lyrical honesty. All of the aforementioned qualities are noticeable on the album's opener 'Vertigo', a thrilling execution of rock mania, 'Miracle Drug', which succeeds greatly due to the breathtaking guitar chords in the middle of the song (the Edge is still very edgy), and 'Yahweh', a reflective look at a man's journey with God. Bono's vocal work is most impressive on other standout tracks like 'Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own' and my personal favorite, 'A Man And A Woman', the most inventive U2 song since 'Exit', off of their Joshua Tree album. The other songs on the album execute U2's musical formula while at moments showing glimpses of true genius (can you say 'Love And Peace Or Else?'!). The album is their best work since 'Achtung Baby', showing that even after several decades, U2 is still capable of producing challenging and edgy music that's soulful and awe-inspiring.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I have never played a final fantasy game in my life.  But I will admit that this was by far the coolest movie i've seen this year.  If you are an action movie fan or if your obsessed with final fantasy definently pick this up!
B000AMPZGC|5.0|Without a doubt, the Burton/Elfman/(Depp) pairing (or trio) has been a profitable and impressive one in the past.  With outings such as THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, BEETLEJUICE, SLEEPY HOLLOW, and CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, I am amazed at what an outstanding director and composer/conductor can do together.    CORPSE BRIDE is certainly no exception.  Elfman's talent pours from this impressive compilation of ditties and instrumental pieces set in the Gothic-like days of yore.  Victor and Victoria, who have never met, are set to be wed, and their families react differently to this occasion in the track entitled \\"According to Plan.\\"  This delightfully funny and rich tune sets the stage for the rest of the album, which contains a mix of several more vocal tracks and many instrumental tunes.    The gothic feel prevails elsewhere on the album, with liberal use of the harpsichord and organ.  Instrumentals such as \\"In the Forest,\\" \\"Moon Dance,\\" and \\"Finale\\" ooze with gothic mystique and a sense of times gone by.  Each time, Elfman captures the essence of emotion and action from the film, translating it flawlessly into music, both with and without words.    In the moving \\"Tears to Shed,\\" Helena Bonham Carter laments the Corpse Bride's dilemma with humor and a touch of sorrow.  Elfman himself voices Bonejangles, who belts out \\"Remains of the Day\\" with jazzy style.  The final vocal track, \\"The Wedding Song\\" is a melliflous mix of styles that sends the listener on a truly marvelous journey.  Its exciting, allegro pace is full of transitions as those involved with the wedding take turns sharing their points-of-view -- all building to a truly magnificent and brilliant cadence.    I must say that I disagree with the Amazon reviewer's opinion that this album shows Elfman overextending himself.  While the soundtrack to CHARLIE... was most excellent, CORPSE BRIDE runs in a different musical vein.  Its style, while often satirical and humorous, is distinctly old-worldly; perhaps even other-worldly.  The notion that Elfman has overextended himself simply isn't the case -- the orchestrations here are rich and full, the lyrics clever and appropriate for all ages, and the overall ambience created by the album is one of slightly spooky, very kooky fun.    Elfman's delicate touch and distinctive style should not be missed here.  You won't regret the chuckles you'll get from the vocal performances, nor will you the humming you'll do as you continue to sing the tunes to yourself long after you're done listening.  Very highly recommended.

1573223026|1.0|After liking all of Nick Hornby's other novels I was greatly disappointed in this book. Whether it were the narrative device of telling the story via the voice of each of the four characters in turn or the shear unlikablility of some of the characters, but I found just getting to the end of this novel to be a challenge. Read, one of his other books, this is easily his worst.

044022165X|3.0|I really enjoy John Grisham books, I usually read them very quickly because I get so into them that I can't put them away. The Rainmaker easily fits this category. It really is quite entertaining and for the most part you will really like the well developed characters and story line.  <br /> <br />It has its flaws though. (FLAW #1) Grisham spends most of the first half of this book developing these characters (Birdie, Price and Bruiser) that you think are going to be really important to the ending but in the second half he just gets ride of them because, I believe, he couldn't figure out what to do with them. (FLAW #2) This is also one of the most unrealistic novels I have read in some time. Judge Kipler would never be allowed to be that biased towards Rudy (at least I hope not), Rudy would never been allowed by any sane person to have that case by himself and Kelly would never immediately fall in love with a man she's barely met especially when she's in a very abusive relationship.  <br /> <br />(Spoiler coming... be ware!!!!) <br /> <br />(FLAW #3) The main thing that ticks me off with this book is the fact that they spend the whole entire book showing you how Great Benefits was a liar and a crook etc and how they are the most unethical company in the whole entire world. Thank goodness there is Rudy to defend the world against such immoral beats of the devil. Then at the end of the book Rudy kills Kelly's husband with a baseball bat and lets Kelly take the blame and while he is trying to get Kelly out of prison he lies to everyone so he can achieve his means. WHY IS IT A GREVIOUS SIN FOR GREAT BENEFIT TO LIE BUT OKAY FOR RUDY? WHY IS OKAY FOR RUDY TO MURDER SOMEONE DIRECTLY WITH A BASEBALL BAT BUT NOT OKAY FOR GREAT BENEFIT TO DENY A CLAIM THAT LED TO SOMEONE BEING KILLED. This is a drastic double standard and it really just left a very bad taste in my mouth.  <br /> <br />P.S. It's also amazing that someone is murdered and they don't even bother to look at the murder weapon and run some prints on it. They also dropped all the charges against Kelly and let the \\"murderer\\" out of prision and on her own in less than two days. Just totally unrealistic.  <br /> <br />EASY BOOK TO READ, ENJOYABLE FOR THE MOST PART BUT JUST TOTALLY UNREALISTIC AND WITH ANNOYING DOUBLE STANDARDS  <br />
1400031087|5.0|The best chronicle of pain and suffering and addiction to date....Inner strength is all there is.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|I was a skeptic when I decided to watch the first season, but figured it was only 12 episodes.  I was positive anyone watching the show had to be single and sexy and career oriented and live in a mega-metropolis to even understand these 4 women's lives.<br /><br />Well, if I still don't totally understand their lives, I can sure cheer them on or empathize whatever the case may be.  Everyone goes through the ups and downs of dating, choosing to have children, choosing to have a career even if all our choices are different.  We can sympathize with and encourage each other nonetheless.<br /><br />The show was great at delving into human emotions.  The ultimate reality show.
B000060P79|1.0|Don't even think of bowing down to Simple Plan. Like a regular wise-old grandfather would say: \\"Ignore the hype. Don't read the positive reviews if you consider it not worth bought\\".
0307276902|5.0|A real life story of addiction and how it can tear apart, rip up, and consume not only the addicted, but all relationships involved.  After reading the book, I felt like I'd been shredded to pieces as well.<br /><br />Very thought provoking and moving.  Whether an addict or someone close to the addicted, the emotion of this book can be related.  A heart-breaking story, one that won't soon leave your memory.
B000AJJNOK|1.0|If you dare to purchase this album, beware of the consequences because hell will await you. As a reference let's say that the 'devil' is Curtis Jackson A.K.A 50 Cent. Being bad as (not bad-ass), and make music for the money and not for the music, the 'devil' will get you by screwing over your wisdom and IQ making it less than 20, you'll never escape the wrath of 50 Cent; ever! So, be with Jesus Christ and he shall bless you at all times. Pray to him and ensure you're not messing with the 'devil' or being posessed by the 'devil'.

B000002C1W|4.0|Great continuation of Pink Floyd's later phase (after Sid Berret). Good album, even after having lost Roger Waters. Right now, I am into a very 80's phase, and A Momentary Lapse of Reason fits well. Yes it has a strong 80's style, but the music is great, especially David Gilmore, Richard Wright, and Tony Levin(great bassist). I'm glad that Floyd continued their ambient, mysterious sound in this album.
B000AA305M|3.0|Life In Slow Motion by David Gray lives up to its name.  The album moves methodically and deliberately with Mr. Gray setting a trotting pace.  While the album drags in places, it has a lush and inviting sonic landscape with strings, brass and keyboards that sweeps you along.  Mr. Gray raspy voice nicely contrasts to the meandering folk-rock songs.  This is an album for anyone who enjoys great instrumentation, but the lyrics leave a little something to be desired.
0689835604|5.0|Both of my boys loved this book.  The flaps aren't too difficult so even an 18 month old was easily able to operate it.  Simple, colorful and great words.  Interactive, but doesn't require mom or dad to help.

B000AL730O|5.0|It's fun skimming through all of the reviews of Chaos and Creation. McCartney's solo career has typically been an \\"either you love it or you hate it\\" affair (though, probably most diehard Macca fans, like myself, agree that his solo work has been very inconsistent, though rarely without at least one or two gems on each album). And his new album seems to be no exception to the rule. I just wanted to chime in with those who firmly believe that this is, by far, the best thing he's done in many years. Easily, the best since Band on the Run and possibly his best solo effort, period. Frankly, I think many of these songs hold their own with the best of his work with the Beatles.  <br /> <br />Now, it is a very different McCartney album. As just about everyone notes, it's much more reflective and pensive than his other solo work. I think that's what has turned off some people who are otherwise fans of his post-Beatles work. But I love it! Songs like \\"Riding to Vanity Faire\\" and \\"At the Mercy\\" sound very different from most of what he's done before, but they are marvelously successful. I also think \\"Follow Me\\" and \\"Jenny Wren\\" are McCartney classics. \\"Follow Me\\" is beautiful in its simplicity while \\"Jenny Wren\\" evokes a deliciously mournful tone (to that extent, it's not readily comparable to \\"Blackbird\\" as McCartney and others have done - the mood is more like \\"Eleanor Rigby\\"). <br /> <br />Who knows if you'll like this album, but you should certainly give it a listen. Consider your purchase a somewhat risky investment. You may really wish you had your money back, but there are a lot of people (like myself) who consider the 10 or so dollars we spent on this cd a STEAL considering how good the music is.
B0007GAERG|3.0|I've never listened to an entire CD of Mariah Carey's because she acts superficial and slutty in her videos and the content of her music has never prompted me to buy one.  But she's had three consecutive hits that desperately made me want to buy the album.   And i am glad I did.  This CD made me temporarily forget my issues and groove.  I will admit it took me a couple of tries before i could get into it, but that's typical for me.   <br /> <br />All of the cameos are nicely done (Snoop, Twista, Nelly).  Some of the songs felt old school but i like a little old school.  So i can't complain.  Overall, this is a great CD to drive to and sing to while other drivers wonder what you're grooving to.
6301752686|5.0|This is a Disney tape with three vintage shorts on it but they are all very good and one is a certified classic and perfect for Halloween.  The run time is than a 1/2 hour but I still think it's worth it, if you can still find it that is.<br /><br />Trick Or Treat (1952) This is a certified classic in my mind, and based on a great story by the legendary Carl Barks, I love the spooky, opening shot of the town.  Donald would rather play a trick on Huey, Dewey, and Louie than give them a treat on Halloween. Witch Hazel overhears the problem and casts a spell on Donald and boys get their treat after all.  Just a great short with gorgeous animation.<br /><br />Pluto's Judgement Day (1935) an Early Technicolor short.  Pluto's cat-chasing days come to a close when he dreams that he's sent to hell and put on trial for killing lots of cats. The jury is composed completely of cats!  Not a true Halloween episode but still a spooky atmostphere.<br /><br />Lonesome Ghosts (1937)  This one is great as well.  Four green phantoms want some fun, so they invite ghost busters Mickey, Donald, and Goofy over to their haunted home with the aim of driving them crazy.  Great early Disney slapstick.<br /><br />This is still a favorite of mine as the animation is all fantastic.
B0007P3582|3.0|This album gets on my nerves. His first album was alot better. I'm sure alot of people will agree. I really don't like rap that much. The only rap/hip-hop I like is by tupac, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, The Notorious B.I.G. and Kanye West. I think 50 could've done a lil better on this.
B000AL730O|2.0|All the critical applause of this new McCartney CD had me foaming at the mouth waiting for my copy to come from Amazon.  And as I write this review, I see that this is the #1 selling CD on Amazon currently.  So, is it me or is it them?  \\"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\\" is bland and without inspiration.  I guess I could blame the producer but I can't imagine this material being very interesting, regardless of who helped Paul put it together.  I've only given it 2 stars on the hope that it might grow on me over time but that seems unlikely.  Sir Paul McCartney has been and will continue to be a musical hero of mine but I should have known better than to trust the critics this time out.  Maybe they all hope to get stage-front tickets from Paul for his new concert tour by pumping-up their acclaim.  Save your money for seeing Sir Paul live if you get a chance.  He won't disappoint you.
B000002C2E|5.0|having just revisited this album recently, I am amazed at the voice, poetry, and instrumentation (that \\"live\\" recording that Dyan insisted upon...with all instruments going and mikes hanging from the ceiling; the \\"old fashioned way\\") that breathes such an incredibly unique sound.<br /><br />Can you hear anything like this anywhere else?  That was my driving thought...is there anything like this, anywhere today?<br /><br />In conclusion (this is short)...I think that Time Out of Mind rivals anything that Dylan has ever done.  I don't know if he could give more than he does on \\"Standing in the Doorway\\", \\"Not Dark Yet\\", and \\"Highlands\\", which sounds so much like he has his heart in eternity.<br /><br />Dylan is so much more self revelatory than he is credited with.<br /><br />this album is a work of genius.
0895292211|5.0|A great book to help take the mystry out of food choices and managing a healthy lifestyle. These concepts will help eliminate obesity simply because it sets forth medical studies and concepts that encourage taking control and managing many health problems. <br />If anyone is tired of yo yo lifestyle this book helps create more time and the ability to take control of our lives, if nothing else, simply because you will cook less and eat more raw foods.
B000929AJQ|3.0|I bought Pretty hate Machine about 6 months after it was released and have been a HUGE fan of NIN ever since. I have loved every single original release from NIN, except for disk 2 of The Fragile, and I don't care for the remix CD's, except Further Down the Spiral. <br /> <br />This one feels like NIN stripped down and made with little effort. Not at all like the other albums. I have always felt that Trent is a true artist, unlike most musicians, but this one feels like there is no artistic effort. <br /> <br />Trent has always had a bad habit of ending songs with 1-3 minutes of repetition, sometimes it works(The Perfect Drug), sometimes it feel like the filler that it is(The Becoming, and shamefully ruins the otherwise awesome and beautiful The Great Below). This bad habit has reach critical mass on With Teeth. <br /> <br />1. All the Love in the World - 4/10 lackluster song with lots of filler. Starts off the CD with a whimper, which is fitting. <br /> <br />2. You know what you are? 2/10 Weak version of anything off Broken <br /> <br />3 The Collector - 7/10 Not bad if it were 30 seconds shorter. Trent needs to stop adding filler, too many potential great songs are ruined because of his habit <br /> <br />4. The Hand that Feeds 7/10 Catchy, throw-away song <br /> <br />5 Love is not enough 5/10 middle of the road would have been a 6 but too much filler at the end <br /> <br />6 Everyday is the Same 5/10 would have been better without the needless filler <br /> <br />7 With Teeth 1/10 AWITHA TEETHA 'nuff said <br /> <br />8 Only 4/10 crappy remake of Down in it <br /> <br />9 Getting smaller 4/10 paint by numbers nin song <br /> <br />10 Sunspots 5/10 Musically decent, lyrically adolescent <br /> <br />11 The Line begins to blur 3/10 sounds like it is a reject of Disc 2 of the fragile, not a compliment <br /> <br />12 Beside you in time 4/10 No reason for this to exist, other then to fill up the CD <br /> <br />13 Right where it belongs 10/10 No filler, outstanding song. The only classic on this pitiful disc. <br /> <br />All things considered, you have to wonder what Trent has done for the past 5 years. This is by far the worst he has put out. It is only one misstep(other then disc 2 of The Fragile), so he can be forgiven. The problem is, we have to wait until 2010 to find out if he really is drained of good ideas, or this was a fluke. <br /> <br />To the poster who tries to prove its quality by sales, please get real. Album sales have nothing to do with quality. Look at the list of best sellers, lots of disposible, corporate created crap on that list.  <br /> <br />It is still better then 99% of the tripe that get released, but that is more of a statement of the sorry state of the music industry as it is a comment on the quality of this CD.
B0006399FS|5.0|From the first track, 'vertigo' to 'sometimes you can't make it on your own', 'city of blinding lights' and 'all because of you', HTDAAB is a quality record throughout. Almost every track is superb and this is one of U2s best albums.
B000683VI4|5.0|I never expected this movie to be so touching and endearing.  What an aswesome movie.  I can watch it over and over and it would still have the same affect on me.  You can actually feel the love the main characters had for each other.  I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who has been in love or long to be in love like Allie & Noah.
B000AA305M|2.0|What made David Gray so lovely and raw and vulnerable was his barren, acoustic style--crackling recordings with little or no background. Look, for a prime example, at his early LPs and \\"Flesh.\\" While some might criticize these low-budget recordings, they became Gray's hallmark and what differentiated him from the rest of the overproduced talent littering the radio.  <br />This seventh album deviates severely from anything to date, giving us elaborate orchestrations and electronic interludes that muddle Gray's tender lyrics and melodic poignance. Producer Marius de Vries has introduced all the bells and whistles (literally) that distinguish mainstream radio pop from the folksy/soulful pop Gray previously turned out. The full orchestra (of synthesizers or humans, one remains unsure) detracts almost as much as the limpid songwriting. <br />For, gone is much of the singer's expression. Those pained and strained vocals once heard are no longer. Instead, he breaks occasionally into a chorus of \\"da-da-da\\" (\\"Slow Motion\\") or a rickety falsetto (\\"From Here You Can Almost See the Sea\\"). There is no vocal exertion behind the words, and none of the melodic build or cathartic breakdown that used to mark Gray's music. <br />While I support artists' development over the years, this seems less like a coming into one's own and more like an attempt to curry favor in the cluttered world of pop radio and production. This belongs on the adult contemporary station alongside Joshua Kadison and Michael Bolton--but not in my reportoire, nor, I suspect, in that of many longtime David Gray admirers.      <br />

0312995423|1.0|Well, this is the first Dan Brown book I have read.  It wasn't all that I expected it to be.  I thought I was going to be riveted and filled with anticipation, but I wasn't.  The plot is interesting, but the storyline was dry.  It was unrealistic.  The book is about a beautiful cryptographer name Susan Fletcher.  She works for the NSA, creating the ultimate computer, TRANSLTR.  TRANSLTR can read people's email without them knowing and decode encrypted messages in no more than three hours.  Ensei Tankado, a Japanese computer genious, did not like the idea of the U.S.A government invading people's privacy.  He decided to create a computer software that gives people the power to hack the NSA.  It is up to Susan and the NSA to stop Ensei Tankado, but Ensei is killed.
B0006399FS|5.0|\\"U2's lost lost the magic\\" <br />\\"Very disapointing\\" <br /> <br />Blah blah blah! This album is awesome. I own every U2 cd every released (except for a few of the singles). HTDAAB ranks among the best.
B0007ZIYWY|5.0|\\"Goo\\" never sounded any better.  Sonic Youth's first major label album had mixed reviews, from hardcore fans, the \\"industry\\", the mainstream, and yes, even the band itself. However, this deluxe edition sounds incredibly good and is just as new and powerful sounding as any other current modern release.  This re-master finally gets the band's stamp of approval as well.  While \\"Goo\\" is helmed as a transition album, some of the songs on this album are \\"classic\\" Sonic Youth songs, and rock just as good as scream and drone.   <br />    The new re-master of the album is much more clearer than the original release, allowing you to hear the songs breath and flow, especially with the demo version disc of the album.  These group of songs sound ten's of times better than the old original 'bootleg' release, and show you what a true \\"re-master\\" of an album should sound like.   <br />    The new bonus songs are pretty good as well, particularly 'Tuff Boyz' and 'Issac'.  One thing I wished they would of done is included the live songs from the 'Dirty Boots' single, in which 'The Bedroom' from disc one comes from.  Otherwise, this re-master makes a great album sound even better, and bring some of those older fans down memory lane for a bit.   <br />     If you got the dough, I recommend getting this album, and if you already own it, but if for the demos.  Rock on!!
B00003CXCW|5.0|Sunset Boulevard is perhaps the most creepy and disturbing film from the 50s. All of it's power remains intact as it still mystifies and creeps you out well into the jaded new millineum. It it very rare when a film not only captures a bizarre atmosphere, but, the atmosphere is so strong it actually becomes a star of the film. It should have received third billing in this wonderful film.  William Holden and Gloria Swanson were perhaps the most strange pairing in this era, but, the chemistry they exude together must be seen to be believed. Every word of the their dialog is precise, intelligent and important. Every scene is a gem, and not many simple stories like this can be so multi-layered to acheive a depth rarely seen in films. Sunset Boulevard is truly a film to cherish forever, and I can't praise Gloria Swanson's masterful performance enough. It is a film that will reveal a new layer every time the viewer watches it, and it never loses any of it's strange and explosive impact. It's basically a  quiet and subtle film that's the equivalent  of a crate of dynamite exploding. It's a \\"must see\\" film that will linger in your mind long after the final frame. Trust me.
B00000IFP6|3.0|This set is back in circulation and, apparently, all the recordings are now available individually. This is probably the more important development for people that want to sample Zinman's review of Beethoven using period speeds and the Bahrenreiter edition.<br /><br />My overall impression of this set is that the recordings are uniformly rapid, or fast, and that the orchestra plays with exceptional clarity. I would say the two best performances in the set are the Symphonies Nos. 5 and 7 and would call the momentous Symphony No. 9 a miss. The others are good if this approach is what you want to hear.<br /><br />For listeners used to performances by the likes of Bernstein, Bohm, Karajan, Furtwangler or other big names in the late 20th century tradition, this set may seem superficial. The speeds are uniformly fast -- the third movement of the Symphony No. 9 is done at such a rapid presto that you won't believe it -- and the performances may seem superficial as a result. No one will ever accuse Zinman of dragging his feet or being dull in this music.<br /><br />Before acquiring this set my only Beethoven experience with Zinman was a performance of the \\"Creatures of Prometheus\\" ballet on the Vox label with the Baltimore Symphony. I thoroughly enjoyed that recording for years and looked forward to Zinman's traversal of the symphonies.<br /><br />Apparently others did, too, since the set sold over 1 million copies in its original printing. This time, it is back at an even lower price. You can buy them on the cheap through an Amazon dealer, making this one of the most economical sets of Beethoven symphonies ever produced short of the famous  set by the London Symphony Orchestra and Josef Krips, which continues to show up now and then on ultra cheap discount labels.<br /><br />There is no comparision between the two sets, of course, since Krips adopted a Cenral European mid-20th century approach while Zinman adheres to period performance style, if not using period instruments. His vibrato is nonexistent, his speeds are rapid and his phrasing is clipped. All this tends to defeat the drama people loved in older recordings, but people attuned to 21st century performance style and sound should love these.<br /><br />Personally, I find Zinman's approach secondary to the first set produced by Roger Norrington on EMI. What Norrington taught us about period performance -- that wasn't copied in Zinman's better sounding recordings -- is the Beethoven's orchestral tutti's build far more rapidly and explosively than anyone ever knew or portrayed on record, tape or CD. Norrington manages this while retaining every bit of drama and scope in the monumental odd-numbered symphonies while pushing the enveloped in the even-numbered symphonies.<br /><br />Norrington's second set of Beethoven symphonies, recorded in concert for Hannsler Classics, is closer in style to this set by Zinman. For me, Zinman's performances, good as they are, do not readily compare to the drama put forth by Norrington 1 and are, by comparison, closer to being ordinary than exceptional. Still, this set is good value for the money and will give many hours of pleasure.instruments. His vibrato is nonexistent, his speeds are rapid and his phrasing is clipped.

B000002MP2|5.0|My mom bought me this cd when I was 11 years old,  I'm 21 now and still listening to it.  There's no songs that you have to skip over.  Every song on this cd could be a hit single.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I heard about Firefly on Michael Totten's blog, and bought it based on his review, and don't regret it one bit!  Can't wait for the movie to come out 9/30 - the trailer looks awesome.<br /><br />The story is basically a western-style drama set 500 years in the future.  The special effects are very good, and don't overshadow (or replance!) the plot or acting, which are both quite good as well.<br /><br />If you like Sci-Fi and lament the dearth of quality available on DVD, this one's a keeper!
B00092ZMDY|5.0|We watched this show three times in the week after we received it and it never failed to mesmerize.  Some songs are edited to be shorter, which is disappointing but overall a wonderful show.  They play all the great classic songs and several new ones.  The concert lasts for about 2 hours 40 minutes.  A great buy, highly recommended.
B00008438V|2.0|John Hughes took the teen drama/comedy to a new level.  His work was one of the things that helped define the 80s, but has unfortunately become one of the most trite, overplayed, bit of fluff in the world.  It's time to move on, people!  80s music / films, was what disco / Blacksploytation was to the 70s, and grunge / extreme violence movies were to the 90s!  But that aside, I liked this movie. <br /> <br />This was a pretty strange premise, a modern day Frankenstein film with teens, but it worked!  It worked because it speaks to a part of us, no matter who we are, that wants to be accepted and be able to control others.  The two nerds who want to be cool but are shunned because they are skinny and awkward, making the audience root for the underdog.  They, as only horny adolescent boys can, create the perfect woman, a slinky, exotic sex kitten who was to satisfy their every need.  It is pretty funny though, when they create this woman who is supposed to be their dream come true, but when they have her, as only horny adolescent boys can, they are so terrified of her that they wear their pants in the shower with her. <br /> <br />Their dream woman Lisa pulls them out of their shell enough to be somewhat accepted by the popular kids (or at least the ones who are obnoxious enough to think they are cool - that Slurpee in the mall was so mean), if not spark a curiousity.  They throw a typically huge, destructive party where they are both exstatic that they are at long last accepted but terrified of the house being ruined.  Along the way, the same popular bullies swindle them into making a perfect woman for them as well, only to have it backfire.   <br /> <br />What prevented me from giving this any higher than 2 stars was the fact that it was just too stupid to be believed.  Sure, its the Frankenstein story again, but how everything just completely works out like magic (the house getting cleaned up, Lisa becoming their mentor, they get the girls, avoid disaster, etc.).  And that scene with the older brother, Chet, getting turned into some kind of monster made it all the more cartoony and silly.  But, huzza for the nerds!   <br /> <br />It's semi-smutty humor with an odd sci-fi twist.  Have fun with it if you like.
0140143505|3.0|A blurb on the front cover claims Hanff's 84, Charing Cross Road to be a \\"beloved classic.\\"  While I wouldn't necessarily go that far, it is a cute book.

0425180638|1.0|I have read all of the Scarpetta novels through The Last Precinct, and I have never wanted hours of my life back as I did when I finished The Last Precinct. <br />  Cornwell tried to go in a new direction with her writing, and it failed. If Kay Scarpetta was a fortune teller, this book may have been alright... <br />  What I mean by that is, in at least 2-3 separate occassions in this book, Kay says \\"I had a feeling I knew exactly what [so in so was going to say/do to me...\\" <br />  Really Kay? Out of absolutely nowhere, you just believe that the unusual way Marino has been acting is due to the fact that you are going to be prosecuted by a special grand jury for homicide even though NOTHING led up to your supposed \\"revelation.\\" You are truly impressive. <br />  Reading this book makes me want to steer clear of Blowfly and Trace, but then again, maybe Cornwell read some reviews and saw that she had to shape up. <br />  This book really ticked me off and I wouldn't recommend it to an enemy.

6302878527|4.0|This is a wonderful caper and a film made for Albert Finney and Audrey Hepburn. Several scenes stand out such as the one where they are in the hotel and didn't realize that breakfast was included. The constant flashbacks are not at all irritating and only add to the sense of film at the time it was made. For anyone who admires the light breeziness of Albert Finney and is madly in love with Audrey Hepburn this is a film for you. Great stuff.
038533348X|4.0|\\"Cats Cradle\\" tells of the story of a man simply setting out to write a book about the atomic bomb. From this simple objective, our hero finds himself thrown into a world of dwarfs, banana republics, Hoosiers, scientists, and one secret formula called Ice-9. The plot is a wild one, but the theme remains constant as Vonnegut pits science against religion in a no holds cage match. In the end, our hero barely survives both as Vonnegut seemingly thumbs his nose at the rest of the world.     \\"Cats Cradle\\" reminds me of Salinger's \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\", both books speak in powerful ways to youthful angst and both tend to grow and develop with their audience. There's no protagonist like Holden Caulfield here (a youthful soul most readers related to strongly) but there are a number of characters that represent the worst society has to offer, characters we see each night on the news. The book starts with \\"Cradle's\\" protagonist, Jonah, coming up against a guarded and cynical scientist who in turn leads him to the three children of Doctor Felix Hoenikker, inventor of the nuclear bomb. Each of Hoenikker's kids, now grown, have some of their father's last experiment Ice-9, a chemical, which freezes all fluids on contact. A small amount could freeze the planet we learn, this while the Hoenikker siblings are running around the globe, each with their tiny thermos of Ice-9, the very future of the world in their incapable hands.  The trail of the sibling's flows to San Lorenzo, a small island, that is responsible for the creation of Bokonism...a religion based on lies. It is here where Ice-9 and Bokonism go head to head and the results are devastating.     Of course Vonnegut's true villain in all this is man and his incredible talent of making wondrous things, be it through God or test tubes, that are very good at destroying us.

0786856297|5.0|THE LIGHTNING THIEF begins with a warning (shades of Lemony Snicket) --- that everything in this book is purely fictional unless the reader starts to experience stirrings and have feelings like those of the hero. Then the reader is advised to close the book and stop reading immediately. The hero, 12-year-old Percy Jackson, is far from your ordinary, everyday high school student. In fact, he is about to be kicked out of his third high school.    Try as he may, Percy just cannot behave himself and settle down to study. His mother understands, for reasons unbeknownst to Percy. After beating up a bully who is attacking his best friend, Grover, strange things start happening to Percy.    In fact, after only one or two chapters, Percy's math teacher turns into a horrible, terrifying monster who tries to kill Percy. Then a gigantic Minotour (yes, a Minotour from Greek mythology) chases Percy until Percy tears off one of his horns and he dissolves into sand. Then, a few seconds later, Percy's own mother disappears before his very eyes in a cloud of golden haze.    What is going on? Grover leads Percy into Camp Half-Blood, which, as it turns out, is inhabited by creatures straight out of ancient Greek mythology --- only all this is happening right now, in the 21st century! And Camp Half-Blood is where students like Percy, who discover they are really demigods, are trained in the ways of the Greek gods (shades of Hogwarts School).    Because of Percy's outstanding clever behavior at the camp/school, he is awarded a quest. Someone has stolen the god Zeus's most precious symbol of power: his lightning bolt. Percy's mission, should he decide to accept it, is to find the thief and return the powerful lightning bolt to Zeus before a war breaks out between Olympus and the Underworld.    As you might imagine, horrible things happen to Percy and his two friends, with monsters and disaster at every turn. (Good thing this is all fiction!). If you can suspend disbelief, you will find this book similar to the old-time movie serials, except that the villains and heroes are Greek mythological figures, right here in present-day America. Uh, oh. Better stop reading this review.       --- Reviewed by Robert Oksner (...)

0440180295|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut claims that he's never had formal training in writing.  It's pretty evident here, but in a good way, if that makes sense.    Slaughterhouse Five is quirky, funny, and ultimately a dispenser of prudent political advice--in both the modern and ancient interpretation of the word.  The book is essentially about the fire-bombing of Dresden in World War II, or even more generally, about the nature of people killing each other.  The following excerpt from the book summarizes it nicely:    \\"...it was a movie about American bombers in the Second World War and the gallant men who flew them.  Seen backwards by Billy, the story went like this:  American planes, full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield in England.  Over France, a few German fighter planes flew at them backwards, sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen.  They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground, and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation.    The formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames.  The bombers opened their bomb bay doors, exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires, gathered them into cylindrical steel containers, and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes.  The containers were stored neatly in racks.  The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own, which were long steel tubes.  They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes.  But there were still a few wounded Americans, though, and some of the bombers were in bad repair.  Over France, though, German fighters came up again, made everything and everybody as good as new.\\"    There's a great deal of satire and irony in the book.  Some of its most poignant sections deal with men deciding to kill other men, using logic in reason in ways that Vonnegut shows to be callous (a judge's long-winded order to execute a deserter, and a military historian's argument in favor of Dresden's fire-bombing by the Allies, among other things, all followed by the book's \\"So It Goes\\" motif).    All in all, a terrific read, and something that ought to be required reading at higher levels of English, or perhaps even in social studies classes.

B00005JKJA|5.0|This is one of the best movies of all time, a classic film noir and one of the most disturbing movies I've seen. <br /> <br />If you are familiar with Lynch's movies you will know that his work is a little off-beat.  Mulholland Drive is no exception.  Even though I understood the movie on first viewing, my second and third viewings since have helped me to understand deeper levels in the plot.   <br /> <br />In a nutshell the movie is about {warning - this may spoil the movie for some who have not seen it yet} the sexual and professional jealousy between two women in a lesbian relationship; one a struggling starlet, the other a Hollywood success.  The movie is shown from the perspective of the struggling starlet (Watt's character).  Betrayal, love, hate, passion, fear, suicide and murder set amongst the backdrop of Hollywood.  I agree with other reviewers that Hollywood is itself a third character in the movie.  Lynch manages to portray it as both its fantasy image (dreams of stardom and glamour) and its reality - a town that more often than not chews up and spits people out.  Profoundly sad and disturbing.

6301640659|5.0|I really don't understand some of the negative reviews that I've read for this film.  And really, why has this film always upset the gay community I never understood.  The film states in the beginning that it is not an \\"indictment of the gay community\\".  The film happens to be set in a gay community and many of the club scenes are at freakshop leather fetish bars.  No matter what side of the coin you fall on personally...(gay/straight), hardcore leather bars are going to be shocking.  It just so happens that the serial killer of this film happens to like to select his victims from these mondo bizarro environments. Anyone other than that of the gay hardcore persuasion would be scared sh*tless in any one of the featured clubs in \\"Cruising\\"!  The killer, always featured behind the same mirrored sunglasses that so many of the other leather freaks in the film wear...the viewer is only aware that they're in HIS prescence when he speaks and his soft, but way freaky voice is heard.  I've seen this film a million times and have loved each viewing.  It's funny though, the scene in the movie booth (for couples only!)...the voice of the featured music playing will enthrall any fan of hardcore punk!  It took me a few times..before I said, \\"I know that voice\\"!  COOLCOOLCOOL!!!  Scorscese-esque a la \\"Taxi Driver\\" freak shopish in the vein of the baddest freak flicks you've ever seen!!

068983571X|5.0|\\"He wasn't walking on his tip-toes, Watson, he was running...running for his life.\\"<br /><br />Written in 1902, The Hound of the Baskervilles is probably the most famous of Conan-Doyle's Sherlock Holmes mysteries, and understandably so. What is there not to love here? Setting this tale amid the legends of the lonely moors of rural Devonshire, Conan-Doyle revived his protagonist from a watery Swiss grave and let Watson take us back a decade to the day a nervous client comes to call on 221-B Baker Street. The man believes full well in the legend of a murderous hellhound which preys upon the male heirs of the all-but extinct Baskerville line, and he fears for the safety of the new heir, who is soon to arrive to take possession of his ancestral home. Whereas the tale of a predatory dog that arose after a 17th century curse might be laughed off in the enlightened Victorian Era, the stark truth is, the previous owner of Baskerville Hall was found dead on his grounds after a nocturnal stroll, his face a mask of terror, and about his body lay the paw prints of an enormous hound! Holmes is asked to determine whether this creature of myth, recently blamed for the suspicious death of the elderly Sir Henry Baskerville, is an apparition or a being of flesh and bone. Holmes sends Watson off to lead the quest for truth, and stays behind in London.  Over the distance of this story, a hyperactive anthropologist, a law and order fanatic local busybody, a slinking, creepy butler and his wife, a beautiful Brazilian lady and the lady's giddy brother are all introduced to us, as is the last living representative of the Baskerville line, an American who disregards all notions of any danger existing from something as silly as a demonic hound. The atmospheric story is super and sucks in even the most resistant mind as it simultaneously zips us back a hundred and ten years and confronts us with a case that is either supernatural or murder most dark.

B0009UC7H0|3.0|A bit disappointing. I was hoping for a closer portrayal of Clive Cussler's recurring cast of characters. Dirk Pitt isn't a jokey, flippant person like Matthew McConnaughey. He's much more brooding and serious. And Steve Zahn??? He was funny, but Al Giordino is supposed to be a short, Italian fireplug who's a solid backup man of few words. He and Dirk have such a close friendship in the books that they understand each other with just a look. None of that here. In the movie they don't seem that connected at all. Rudy Gunn should be older and very intelligent (not whiny and confused). William Macy was the closest, in appearance, anyway. But where's the tough-as-nails banty rooster? Just using a few swear words doesn't get it. Had I never read the books, I would have liked the movie better. It was still fun, though. I just had to stop thinking of it as a Clive Cussler novel. As for Penelope Cruz, well, whatever. She's not that attractive, not that good an actress. Unmemorable. But the movie is a mildly enjoyable 2 hours.

B000A88EV4|5.0|It has been said that there is a fine line between genius and madness and this is certainly epitomized by the protagonist of Mike Leigh's Naked, a scathing, uncompromising portrait of an angry young man. Does genius preclude or cause madness? Most people can't see the dots to connect them unlike geniuses who are able to see the bigger picture. Naked is a film that is as direct and honest as its title suggests.<br /><br />Mike Leigh's portrait of London is a drab, grungy one filled with desperate lonely souls and dirty, rubble-strewn streets - the antithesis of the warm, romanticism of Richard Curtis movies like Notting Hill. There is nothing romantic about Naked and it is Johnny's cynical worldview that dominates the film and is one of its most intriguing aspects. Naked is one of the most important films to come out in the 1990s. It is an angry howl of protest against Margaret Thatcher's `80s England.<br /><br />The first disc features an audio commentary by writer/director Mike Leigh and actors David Thewlis and Katrin Cartlidge that was taken from the previously released laser disc. This is a smart, extremely informative track with excellent comments from all the participants.<br /><br />Also included is the original theatrical trailer.<br /><br />The second disc features \\"Neil LaBute on Naked.\\" The director of Your Friends and Neighbors (1998) discusses what he likes about Leigh's film: the relationships between people living in a city like London and how they don't quite connect with one another.<br /><br />\\"The Art Zone: `The Conversation'\\" features novelist Will Self interviewing Leigh in March 2000 for a BBC arts show. Self comes off as pretentious at times (especially when he talks about his own work) but does have some spot-on observations like when he describes Leigh's work as being \\"spiritual\\" in nature.<br /><br />Finally, there is \\"The Short and Curlies,\\" a short film Leigh made with Thewlis and Alison Steadman in 1987 about a romance between a hairdresser's daughter and a young man.

B000002H33|5.0|The masterpiece of thrash metal, following and enhancing its predacessors Ride the Lightning and Kill 'em All, it has a more mature compositional structure and a wider range of lyrical themes. <br /> <br />The lyrics all feature manipulation in various forms and awaken the disgust for it within the listener. <br /> <br />The first track, Battery, starts off calmly, possibly depicting a smooth flow of life. Then it suddenly explodes into a slow but very heavy drum pounding, finishing off with a thrash frenzy. The lyrics feature violence and anger as a sort of manipulation, and express the opinion that people shouldn't let anger control them or use violence to relieve their frustrations. <br /> <br />The song Master of Puppets is immensely complex in structure, and the most amazing feature is that although it lasts over 8 and a half minutes, not one part of it is boring. After the 2nd verse the song heads into a slow solo, one of the rare solos James Hetfield performed, suddenly exploding into a very fast and hard drum beat. The lyrics of this song are centered around drugs and their manipulation of people. <br /> <br />Following up is a song featuring cult followers as a distinct sort of \\"puppets\\". The Thing That Should Not Be is certainly an unfitting name for such a musical masterpiece. <br /> <br />The fourth track is the second time Metallica experimented with the inclusion of slow songs, such as Fade To Black on Ride the Lightning, and the subsequent Nothing Else Matters, The Unforgiven (Metallica / The Black Album), Until it Sleeps, Mama Said (Load), etc. Welcome home (Sanitarium) speaks in the name of an imprisoned lunatic, describing how locking people up isn't going to make them any better (\\"Keep him tied, it makes him well / He's getting better, can't you tell?\\"; \\"They keep me locked up in this cage / Can't they see it's why my brain says \\"RAGE\\"?\\"). <br /> <br />The next song, Disposable Heroes, features the mind of a fatally wounded soldier reflecting uponhis inability to change his fate and rebels against the inadequate level of care the government gives the people who it sends off to war, worrying only about victory and not lives. The chorus is particularly well written (\\"Soldier boy, made of clay, now an empty shell / 21, only son, but he served us well / Bred to kill, not to care, do just as we say / Finished here, greeting death, he's yours to take away!\\"). Also the solo is very commendable as is the militaristic atmosphere of the song's music in general. <br /> <br />The sixth manipulation is religion, featured in Leper Messiah. It rebels against blind devotion and the manipulation of people who worship the church because of their beliefs and contribute to them finantially. <br /> <br />The seventh track features an instrumental masterpiece, lasting over 8 minutes and discarding any voices whatsoever, it also includes Cliff Burton's last solo before his unfortunate demise. <br /> <br />The album finishes off with advice to keep being true to yourself and step away from the manipulation, showing that heavy influence of Cliff Burton on the rest of the band. There are also signs of anti-violence, somewhat resembling the song Seek and Destroy (Blood follows blood and we make sure / Life ain't for you and we're the cure). <br /> <br />I strongly recommend this album to ANYONE, even people who have never fancied metal as a musical preference, and if ANYONE is to call himself a fan of either thrash metal or its pioneers, Metallica, not having this album would be a crime, as it's certainly one of their best.
B0007GAERG|5.0|My oh my....those Virgin execs must be burning up inside and kicking themselves for letting this one get away! If there was EVER any doubt regarding mariah's retun to top form, this album most certainly did away with those doubts!...Every detail of this album proves that the newly christened \\"Mimi\\" is back and is ready and able to take on all challengers...    I must admit I had mixed reactions about the realease of this record after 2002's Charmbracelet didn't nearly meet my expectaions, but i will most gladly admit that this release not only met and surpassed those expectaions but althogether blew me away!    From the bewitching pose Mimi strikes on the front cover of leaflet, to the last echoing sounds of her high hitting note on the closing track \\"Fly like a Bird\\", Mariah Carey's 2005 release is nothing short of remarkable when you remember where she was just a few years ago when it seemed everyone had written her off as yeserday's news after the flop of \\"hurricane Glitter.\\" But she held her head high and has gotten past that and  evidence of her happiness is showcased all through her latest release.    This album can most easily and acurately be  described as a party record but is is indeed more than that... Tracks like the highly infectious \\"shake it off\\"... the lead party single..\\"It's like that\\" and defiantely one of the highlights of the album...the awesome \\"Get Your Number\\" showcase the free atmostphere of the record. She enlists the help of such personalities as Jermaine Dupri, Snoop Dogg and Twista who serve to not only add their own livlely touch to the album, but really serve as a compliment to Mariah's silky and sultry vocals.    On songs such as \\"One and Only\\", \\" Circles\\" and \\" i wish I knew you\\", Mimi's versitile voice changes with emotion that makes the listener feel the pain and other emotions that one goes through in a relationship at one point...    Similarly...on songs such as Mine again, the smash hit \\" we belong together and my personal fave\\" fly like a bird\\", Mariah's voice is unmistakeable.. every note adds to the mood of the song which in these cases is lonelyness...a theme which she is able to use her voice to make you cry...The closing track is where Mariah really lets go...its a gospel flavoued tune about trust in God and surviving life with that trust...    Throughout the album, the strength of Mariah's voice is very evident. With every tune she delivers exactly what is needed to get the messge across as only she can. No matter the theme of the song she is able to showcase her voice with all the emotion that has become assosiated with her...   And although thrughout the album it seems that she has given up on those glass shattering notes...fans need not despair... for as the album draws to a close she delivers that as well...proving to the last critic that this is indeed The Return Of The Voice!!    this album comes highly recommeded, and if you love the singles that are curently out...stay tuned there's much more to expect from Mimi!!
B000AMPZGC|5.0|Elfman has done it again, another outstanding soundtack to a soon-to-be-classic film. Contrary to the Amazon review, I think there is not a dud among these songs and find the soundtrack flawless. The soft flowing themes, the vibrant upbeat moments and the bonus tracks-WOW!! The best soundtrack so far this year and maybe in the last 10 years and Elfman's finest moment. I give 10 stars if allowed. A must have...
078681859X|4.0|The Bartimaeus Trilogy has a great voice--comical, cynical, realistic.  Good read for anyone who likes fantasy.  Has great examples of moral struggles with Bartimaeus--a demon who has no loyalty to anyone, but seems to have a conscience at times--but you don't have to head them if you are just looking for light entertainment. <br /> <br />Highly recommend the read!
B0000025T6|5.0|When I first bought this CD, I gave it two spins and put it away, disgusted. It was dark, morose, depressing and anything but inspiring. Nothing in it really held my attention. Plus, it didn't have the kick that attracted me to so much of Bruce's other work.  <br /> <br />Years later, I heard a couple of cuts from the album on an alternative radio station and enjoyed them. So I decided I would give the album another chance. Oh what a day that was.  <br /> <br />This ain't your daddy's Springsteen. None of the characters that Bruce sings about are going out for a night of dancing or riding in a Cadillac, long and dark, shiny and black. No way and no how.  <br /> <br />This album is full of stories and its truest value is in its lyrics. The people in the stories are the downest and most desperate you ever heard about. Many reach middle age and can't find work in the one thing they're any good at. Many stand convicted of crime. One even pleads with a judge to put him to death instead of forcing him to sit in jail for years on end. Still others are searching in vain and in the cold for the days when they were young and felt so capable.  <br /> <br />So yes, the album is dark and morose. But it is also inspiring. Springsteen tells stories with words and melodies that grab at your guts and squeeze. When you are listening, you know you looking at life inside of those greasy little towns you've seen along the Jersey Turnpike -- the ones where everyone seems to have a junked car and a chained-up dog their barren back yard. <br /> <br />The album ends with a curious selection, titled \\"Reason to Believe.\\" It's all about how some people have lost love and have lost loved ones and who still find a reason to believe. Is that a coincidence? I bet not.  <br /> <br />
B000BB1MHS|5.0|Wow.  I took my children to see this film and they absolutely loved it.  They are very familiar with the original version, as we have watched it many times.  It took me a while to \\"get it\\" so to speak, but when I did, something really weird happened.  Has Tim Burton figured out a way to send real physical euphoria through a movie screen?  I ask this because I left the theatre and could not stop laughing. I could not believe what I had just seen and that it was affecting me physically.  Mind you, in a very strange (but fun) way.  Let me put it this way, it's true, you can get \\"high\\" without drugs.  Of course this went completely over the heads of the kids so no worries there. <br /> <br />The songs were so much fun that we immediatley went out and got the soundtrack!  Depp was very good.  The only strange thing is that he had this Michael Jackson thing going on.  By the time the euphoria hit, I did not care.  There is a sub-plot that is not in the original movie and a nice little story in itself. <br /> <br />About the visuals...(I am laughing just writing this), just phenominal.  There was so much to look at and appreciate in this film.   <br /> <br />I went to see this knowing that I was going to hate it.  I put it off until the very last day it was at the theatre. I would not even have gone, but the kids talked me into it.  Don't make the same mistake.  Buy it, and enjoy it.  This is most definitely a film that you can watch over and over.
0312323859|5.0|This was the sequel to Something Borrowed and I really enjoyed it.  Hearing the story from Darcey's point of view made me shake my head a lot and really dissect all of her shallow behaviors.  I didn't suspect the ending until the end, so that kept me from putting the book down.  Very fun read.  You should read Something Borrowed to understand the characters and dynamics amoung them.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|By far one of the funniest movies about a nobody!!!! This will be a classic!!!
0151008116|5.0|I didn't really know what to expect when I started reading this book.  Even halfway through the book I still hadnt realized that it was not a true story.  The writing style is fresh and entertaining.  The language used is wonderfully penned.  The story itself is told in a truly engaging way with lots of detail and color.<br /><br />I've recommended The Life of Pi to all of my friends and family and bought a copy for a friend of mine as a birthday gift.
B000AL730O|4.0|With the average success of his last album \\"Driving Rain\\", McCartney took quite a time to polish his new creations. Fortunatly, the result is quite a great worth !  <br /> <br />The first time I listened to this album, only a very few songs really stayed in my mind. After a few tries, I got used to the new style and I began to enjoy McCartney's new creations. Without any doubt, the music sounds a bit old (Beatles fans will enjoy, 90s fans may feel quite lost). However, Macca has succeeded in avoiding the trap of repeating old hit songs.  <br /> <br />Mostly, the album sounds dark and if it wasn't of \\"Fine line\\" and a few rock melodies, you would definitely get quite a moderatly slow result. The styles are varied from the thematic \\"English Tea\\" to the beautiful acoustic guitar melody on \\"Jenny Wren\\". Lyrics are well written and focused on the essence of each song.  <br /> <br />As he did before, Paul plays all the instruments on this album, including piano, guitars, drum, bass, cello, harmonium and others. The result is impressive and shows Macca's tendency for perfection. <br /> <br />Obviously, this not Macca's best album, but if you have respect for his past masterpiece, you should give it a try and chances are that you will enjoy and add this title to your \\"must have\\" collection.
B000AL730O|5.0|After a four year drought, Paul McCartney has graced us with a new material studio album. The wait was worth it. If you have read a few of the reviews already posted, or those of actual critics, you will find them discussing the topic of people thinking that such long standing artists such as Paul who deliver new material are in some kind of special creative high peak. These critics usually dismiss such notions, although there are a few that agree. However, there are other people out there they don't mention. Those people who will dismiss and slam new product just because it is new material and that nothing can match the output from their legendary heyday. Or in this instance, people who will, no matter what, critique new material from Paul harshly because it is not up to Beatles code. This is sad since this new album is quite striking. Beautifully done, arranged, and put together. Other albums Paul has put out in the last decade or so have been better, entertaining-wise anyways, like 1997's wonderful \\"Flaming Pie\\", and 1999's rockingly brilliant \\"Run Devil Run\\". This latest CD finds Paul in a more low key mood, and there is no real rave up guitar rocker in the bunch. Anybody looking for that classic Paul wail or hot guitar work will be disappointed. There are a handful of huge highlights here, and just as many throwaways. The album starts off with \\"Fine Line\\", a classic up tempo piano tune from Paul that has a mesmerizing piano catch, and that all too familiar counting down in the beginning. Great way to start off the album. Classic Paul piano tune. Other highlights include the haunting and beautiful \\"Jenny Wren\\". Played on accoustic guitar, the song has a classic \\"Beatlesesque\\" melody that is reminiscent of \\"Blackbird\\", which Paul has said in many an interview as well. \\"Friends To Go\\" is a very George Harrison sounding tune, and \\"At The Mercy\\" is a lovely piano tune. It has a nice lyrical catch, and has a darker sounding melody to it. \\"Follow Me\\" is a nice littleditty, and it has a classic sounding quality and lyrical vibe to it. \\"Riding To Vanity Fair\\" is a very well put together tune, and it has a very pretty melody to it. \\"Promise To You Girl\\" is my favorite song on the CD. A classic, catchy as heck piano tune that finds Paul in incredible form. This one you will be playing over and over. The last track, \\"Anyway\\", is gorgeous. The piano meldy sounds an awful lot like the song, \\"People Get Ready\\", but it's incredible. Make sure you keep listening after this track is done. An up tempo instrumental pops up. Producer Nigel Goodrich, who has worked with Coldplay, brings a new sound to the proceedings that is new and fresh, but at the same time is still very Paul McCartney. Paul plays all the instruments on this disc, like on his 1970 solo debut release, \\"McCartney\\", but there is some help from other musicians on a few tracks. What is most spectacular is McCartney's voice. It's amazing. He sounds incredible on this CD. This album is consistent, well written, with some incredible vocals by Paul. His musicianship is untouchable. Even though there are songs here that aren't quite the best, what is good is really good. A top notch release from McCartney. Keep 'em coming Paul.
B000002U9E|5.0|Kate Bush is as we all know a phenomenal singer that has influenced many of todays greatest artists such as Tori Amos, Sarah McLachlan and Fiona Apple. Yet what makes this album so superb is the progression that she has made with music. In the mid-80's music was typical 80's with no real progression, yet when Kate Bush released this album it became her biggest hit yet overseas and it was a huge critical success because of the progression she has made with music. The music offered on this album is rather haunting, a mix of alternative and progressive rock alongside lovely piano ballads. The album is split into two parts/sides, Side One: \\"Hounds Of Love\\" and Side Two: \\"The Ninth Wave\\". This album is also available on a 1997 re-issue with 6 bonus tracks. That is also a good album however I am reviewing the original, \\"Hounds Of Love\\". What do I think?<br /><br />Side One: \\"Hounds Of Love\\".<br /><br />Possibly her most well known song overseas is \\"Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God)\\". This song is a dark song with a great wailing synthesizer in the background. It tells the story of someone wanting to make a deal with God and change places with someone else. Kate's voice is quite operatic on this song.<br /><br />The title \\"Hounds Of Love\\" is really lovely and has vivid background vocals which sound  like dogs howling. The strings are superb keeping the song flowing throughout. The lyrics are quite special as well, \\"Take my shoes off and throw them in the lake..\\".<br /><br />On the 1997 re-issue there is a remix of this track \\"The Big Sky\\". This song is an upbeat Kate and is perfectly suited for summer listening. The vocals are really cute.<br /><br />As the only sombre song on side one, \\"Mother Stands For Comfort\\" seems a bit out of place. However it is nice to see a slow song after three relatively mid-tempo to fast, upbeat songs. Well balanced. She sings about how Mother's are comforting.<br /><br />\\"Cloudbusting\\" is a tie with the first track as the best song on the first 'section' of this album. She sings about wanting to make something happen and you can hear the longing in her voice.<br /><br />Side Two: \\"The Ninth Wave\\".<br /><br />Now as we progress into the \\"The Ninth Wave\\" you will have to prepare yourself for an intensely emotional experience, to start that journey is the almost Tori Amos sounding ballad \\"And Dream Of Sheep\\". This song wouldn't be out of place on Amos's album \\"Little Earthquakes\\". This ballad is very lovely.<br /><br />\\"Under Ice\\" seems like a song off \\"Medulla\\" or \\"From A Choirgirl Hotel\\". It really is quite scary and dark, undoubtedly the darkest song on the album. It's a good song though.<br /><br />The piano takes force well into the next song as well, \\"Waking The Witch\\" which seems like a ballad to the dead. The song is so absolutely amazing and has a fluttery start then falls into a very challenging mix of different styles that is quite robotic.<br /><br />The next song sounds like Bjork's \\"Venus As A Boy\\", at the start though and paces along quite smoothly. It is probably the most boring song on the album though, not to say it is bad at all.<br /><br />\\"Watching You Without Me\\" takes a while to really start.<br /><br />\\"Jig Of Life\\" may be the best track on the album because it is so catchy and uses traditional Celtic music well. Reminds you instantly of the Scottish highlands. Towards the end it has some superb narration and mid-way through the song it changes tempo slightly. An amazing song with great lyrics.<br /><br />\\"Hello Earth\\" has a chant going on towards the end of the song and is one of the longest songs on the album. The long silence at the end could be avoided though but other than that the song is great. The choir could shorten their interludes slightly.<br /><br />After all the darkness of the \\"The Ninth Wave\\" the last song, \\"The Morning Fog\\" closes the album perfectly and seems the resolution to the story Kate was telling through the whole album.<br /><br />I thoroughly recommend this album and the 1997 re-issue with the phenomenally beautiful ballad \\"Under The Ivy\\" (bonus track), yet this album, the original, is amazingly real and seems like a life-long journey and eventually she comes out on top, a resolution was found to her struggles.r />I thoroughly recommend this album and the 1997 re-issue with the phenomenally beautiful ballad \\"Under The Ivy\\" (bonus track), yet this album, the original, is amazingly real and seems like a life-long journey and eventually she comes out on top, a resolution was found to her struggles. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000AL730O|1.0|After reading such a buzz about \\"Chaos and Creation\\", I was really disappointed when I finally heard the whole thing. I heard the single \\"Fine Line\\" on Paul's website and wasn't impressed. But after hearing the entire album, it does seem to be one of the better songs. In Rolling Stone, which claimed it to be his \\"Best work in years\\", they confess that the album doesn't \\"rock\\", which it doesn't. It's bland, boring and, I would say, one of his worst. A few of the songs are downright embarrassing (like \\"English Tea\\") If you want to buy it, please listen to the samples first. This is for DIE-HARD Macca fans only. And it does not rock!

Would recommend it to any music lover <br />Keep rocking Rod :-):-):-)
B000AMPZGC|5.0|This soundtrack is wonderful! It lives up to Danny Elfman's astouding career easily. Let's go through the songs:<br /><br />1)Main Titles- A great opening piece. The mysterious elements blend seamlessly with the Victorian sound Elfman plays with throughout the movie.<br /><br />2)According to Plan- You know a song is good when it entertains and informs at the same time! It's tons of fun to hear these wonderful British actors singing together.<br /><br />3)Victor's Piano Solo- Pretty self-explanatory. Beautiful tune.<br /><br />4)Into The Forest- A soft beginning turns into a tune of wonderment, soon followed by ringing notes of terror. Classic Elfman heard here--very cool.<br /><br />5)Remains of the Day- The song where Elfman's voice shines, it is also the introduction of jazz into the story. A highly morbid song, sang with happy sounding music, is always awesome and welcome in Burton/Elfman collaborations. (My personal favorite!)<br /><br />6)Casting A Spell- Another song that blends mystery with some Victorian. Eerie, yet... catching.<br /><br />7) Moon dance- This song is beautiful, and has a very creative tune. It brings curiousity to my mind, for some reason.<br /><br />8)Victor's Deception- The music portrays many emotions in this song--from horror vibes at the beginning to sweet and sad in the end.<br /><br />9)Tears To Shed- I love this song as well! 8 provides a perfect introduction. Helena Bonham Carter's voice is full of emotion, and Jane Horrocks and Enn Reitel have wonderful character voices that make the song what it is.<br /><br />10)Victoria's Escape- Full of Victorian Horror music, with some pretty melodies played in the middle.<br /><br />11)The Piano Duet- Excellent. Just excellent. This piece is just so cool; especially near the end. The voices at the end are very cool too.<br /><br />12)New Arrival- A very short, very jazzy piece. Catchy.<br /><br />13)Victoria's Wedding- An interesting piece, with rapidly changing emotions. A happy ending is there.<br /><br />14)The Wedding Song- The fourth and last lyrical piece. This one is absolutely wonderful! At times slow, at others fast, it's always a happy excitable smash.<br /><br />15)The Party Arrives- This song seems to have a different tune every couple seconds-it seems to describe everyone arriving, one by one. Very cool.<br /><br />16)Victor's Wedding-At times, it is quiet and almost morose, but eventually, the happiness can be heard coming back. It's filled with hope and joy, with only a touch of sadness.<br /><br />17)Barkis's Bummer- Very low note song. Mysterious with a touch of fear. Intriguing chords.<br /><br />18)The Finale- This is the lightest song on the soundtrack. You can feel the happy ending in each individual note.<br /><br />19) and 20) End Credits parts 1&2- A very fun way to watch the credits. Jazzy, cool, and a good summary of the songs heard throughout the movie.<br /><br />Bonus Tracks- Excellent interpretations of songs from the movie-it could pass for a jazz act!<br /><br />This is an excellent soundtrack! Trust me, you won't regret buying it.emotions. A happy ending is there. <br /> <br />14)The Wedding Song- The fourth and last lyrical piece. This one is absolutely wonderful!

B00000DGUY|5.0|I love Dire Straits. I love Mark's attitude, and he's an excellent guitar player, plus he can adapt his voice to any song they are playing. Their videos are really fun to watch, too, so I recommend getting the DVD with this.  <br /> <br />Dire Straits began as a band with really groovy rhythms, take Sultans Of Swings, Lady Writer or Down To The Waterline (not available here, shame). And, with an ever changing lineup, the band began evolving. Not that they were better, because they've always been equally good, but Mark was becoming more emotional with his music and you can see much more emotion in songs like Your Latest Trick, On Every Street or Wild Theme. <br /> <br />Sultans Of Swing - One of my 10 favourite songs of all time. Mark's guitar sounds great here. The whole band is doing an excellent performance. Two of the greatest solos ever recorded in rock, and for guitar players, the second one isn't as difficult as it seems! /10 <br /> <br />Lady Writer - Another song with a great rhythm, and once again excellent guitars. Great song, I love it. 10/10 <br /> <br />Romeo And Juliet - Never been a fan of this, but when I do listen to it, I have a huge blast. Some good lyrics. From this point onwards we don't get anymore of the groovy rhythm of the first two songs. 9/10 <br /> <br />Tunnel Of Love - Huge epic. Excellent song. I like the instrumental near the end. Great video too, except for the dancing in the tunnel scenes -- What the hell? 10/10 <br /> <br />Private Investigations - Has got some nice guitars, but the vocals sound horrible and the ending is boring. 5/10 <br /> <br />Twisting By The Pool - Classic tune. Not very memorable, but a huge blast. Nice solo. 9/10 <br /> <br />Love Over Gold - Perhaps the most mature composition yet. I love the instrumental breaks. Great song. 9/10 <br />   <br />So Far Away - I love this song! Great riffs, great bass, and excellent lyrics. 9.5/10 <br />    <br />Money For Nothing - I will commit the crime of saying the 4 minute version is pretty good. This one's great though, because near the end you get to listen to that riff over and over again. I love this song. 10/10 <br /> <br />Brothers In Arms - Classic. I don't know what I like so much about this song, but it rocks. And so does the video. Really good track. 10/10 <br />   <br />Walk Of Life - And yet another song from Brothers In Arms, a a great track. Who hasn't listened to this before? Great backing vocals in the chorus. Yeah! 10/10   <br /> <br />Calling Elvis - Weakest song here (not counting Private Investigations). 8/10 <br />    <br />Heavy Fuel - Not crazy about this but it's a real blast. Heavy heavy fueeeeel! 8.5/10     <br /> <br />On Every Street - Closes with a great instrumental part, and has got an excellent saxophone riff. Really good. 9/10 <br /> <br />Your Latest Trick - Wow! Awesome saxophone riff. I love it. One of my favourite songs ever, and in my top 3 by Dire Straits (Sultans Of Swing, Money For Nothing and this one). The stuido version is even better. 10/10 <br />     <br />Wild Theme - Pretty good solo, very melodic, unlike some solo guitarists out there. Great song, again, very emotional. 9/10
B00004RF9B|5.0|Not your blood and guts space flik as may be presuemd from the cd cover.  (The scene never happened.) <br />Good effects for its time.  My daughters, 8 and 12, who have seen all the recent sci stuff still thought that this was pretty cool. <br />
B000002MU3|2.0|If there are a glut of these CDs on the used market, it's because it's just not a good album.  I'm an REM fan, and I own nearly all of their CDs and this one is far and away my least favorite.  There are a couple of decent tracks on here.  I actually think \\"What's Your Frequency, Kenneth?\\" is a bit OVERrated, but it's not bad.  \\"Bang and Blame\\" is pretty good, but it's not worth suffering through the rest of the album to get there.  Repetitive lyrics, repetitive songs, and entirely too much distortion make this one to pass.
0895260131|4.0|This book makes a strong case for Judeo-Christian culture by contrasting it with that of Islam. Islam is the religion of the sword, and always has been. That is an essentially uncontested fact. There is a world-wide effort to obscure and deny the obvious implications of that fact, and Spencer unmasks the deceptions. Unpopular truths are illuminated in the process, and they may make some readers uncomfortable. Those ashamed of their white European ancestry owe it to themselves to see the other side even if they have to hold their noses while reading. If they are honest, they will feel much better when they are done.
B00008BRB5|5.0|Synchronicity was a term created by Carl Jung to describe the confluence of \\"universal forces\\" and the life experiences of an individual.  This concept is very heady stuff and an unusual choice as a concept for a pop album.  However the musical and lyrical brilliance and creativity of the Police, led by Sting, manages to make an album that was more than enjoyable, it was the most successful album of the group, selling more than 8 million copies, yielding a Grammy Award, and a place on best albums lists.<br /><br />The fast-paced opening song lyrically describes the concept of synchronicity well.  The catchy hooks of \\"Synchronicity I\\" is pleasing, though hard to do more than hum to because this song is anxious to speed a listener into the album.  I am unsure of how \\"Walking in Your Footsteps\\" fits into the concept of synchronicity.  This song compares us to dinosaurs, and asks whether we to might follow dinosaurs into extinction.  The African beat of this song is enjoyable, and the lyrics are easy to master.  Though this song is slower than the entry, it is more interesting for those of us that like to sing along, even if we do so only in our own minds.  The following song uses pop riffs with a nice jazz theme to ask the musical question, where is god?  \\"O My God\\" asks what others have asked; how can God allow bad things happen?  Sting also makes the point that he seems to be on the wrong end of events.<br /><br />Now for a totally strange interlude; every time \\"Mother\\" is playing, anyone who walks by who hears this song wonders whether I have completely lost my mind.  Perhaps I have, but this experimental number is a nice exploration of the negative effects mother-son relationships can have.  Certainly it reminds me of mine.<br /><br />Follow one unusual song by another.  I have read several interpretations of \\"Miss Gradenko.\\"  The one that aligns most closely with my own, which is that Miss Gradenko is a member of the Soviet bureaucracy.  All the references seem to relate to the Soviet Union much better than the interpretation that Miss Gradenko is a teacher.  This short song with guitar counterpoints is more complex than it first seems.<br /><br />\\"Synchronicity II\\" is a musically heavier number that lyrically has many layers.  The father is caught up in his workaday world, trying to deal with the sameness of his job and the responsibilities of his family.  The other theme that alternates is that of the Loch Ness monster crawling from the lake.  Does the creature represent escape?  Perhaps it is the monster in our brains stealthily coming to consume us.  This powerful song hit #9 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart and #16 on the Billboard Hot 100.<br /><br />The next song is creepy.  \\"Every Breath You Take\\" is about an obsessed stalker.  The lyrics are catchy and repetitive, and the music is pretty, but that prettiness hides a thematic ugliness that makes this song one of Sting's best musical tricks, nearly a joke.  I find it bizarre that this song, which reached #1 on two charts and appeared on four charts total, was mistaken for a love song.<br /><br />I think \\"King of Pain\\" is one of my favorite Police songs because the lyrics are evocative and poetic.  There is a dark tone to the singing that is slightly in counterpoint to the beat of the music, which tends to be a characteristic of Sting's music.  This song hit #1 in Mainstream Rock, #3 on the Billboard Hot 100, and #33 on the Adult Contemporary chart.  Another interesting song is \\"Wrapped around Your Finger,\\" which includes such lyrics as \\"...caught between the Scylla and Charibdes...,\\" which are mythical references, of which there are many in this excellent and catchy song.  This song hit #13 on Adult Contemporary, #9 on Mainstream Rock, and #8 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts.<br /><br />The song \\"Tea in the Sahara\\" is another dark song that is hard to resist.  The music is quiet and eerie, as the song tells the story of at least three sisters (\\"My sisters and I...\\") waiting in the desert for a man who never returns.  In the end their wait is in vain.  The hopefulness of the sisters is balanced by the actual details of their forlorn and unrealized hope, and their ultimate sad fate.<br /><br />The last song has an interesting twist.  \\"Murder by Numbers\\" initially appears to be about a single killer.  Then the song moves on to the development of serial killers.  However, the capper is the final stanza, where Sting sings that the peak of the profession of killing is to become a leader of the land, whereupon you can murder without lifting a finger.<br /><br />The Police burned brightly in the five albums they recorded from 1978 to 1983.  Even now songs such as \\"King of Pain\\" and \\"Every Breath You Take\\" sound fresh.  Sting's experiences and knowledge attained as a secondary school English teacher frequently enhanced the power of the lyrics.  The skill and creativity of the three members of the group also led to conflicts that led to the group's permanent dissolution after the release of \\"Synchronicity.\\"  Perhaps there is a bittersweet pleasure is listening to this music time and again, but at least a legacy of their creativity and musical influence remains, with \\"Synchronicity\\" being the best of the group's albums.isters and I...\\") waiting in the desert for a man who never returns.

However, the capper is the final stanza, where Sting sings that the peak of the profession of killing is to become a leader of the land, whereupon you can murder without lifting a finger. <br /> <br />The Police burned brightly in the five albums they recorded from 1978 to 1983.  Even now songs such as \\"King of Pain\\" and \\"Every Breath You Take\\" sound fresh.  Sting's experiences and knowledge attained as a secondary school English teacher frequently enhanced the power of the lyrics.  The skill and creativity of the three members of the group also led to conflicts that led to the group's permanent dissolution after the release of \\"Synchronicity.\\"  Perhaps there is a bittersweet pleasure is listening to this music time and again, but at least a legacy of their creativity and musical influence remains, with \\"Synchronicity\\" being the best of the group's albums. <br />
0060763280|4.0|\\"Think Rich To Get Rich\\", says the book jacket.   <br /> <br />In Secrets of the Millionaire Mind, T. Harv Eker, motivational speak and seminar host, gives his valuable insights in to the mentality and thought processes of the rich (and those who are on their way) versus the poor.  He frequently compares and contrasts the two classes, not for character flaws, but for \\"thinking\\" flaws.  He makes a compelling case and I people for fit each of the types he describes. <br /> <br />In the first part of the book he introduces the \\"Money Blueprint\\" that each of us carries in our heads.  This is the set of ideas and attitudes towards money, work, wealth and success that we pick up from parents, friends, co-workers, etc.  This blueprint determines how successful we will be in accumulating wealth.  For example, if you think all rich people are bad, then you will probably not become rich (because you do not want to be bad).  He contends that you will subconsciously mishandle your resources so that you never succeed in accumulating wealth. <br /> <br />The second and longer part of the book contains Eker's 17 \\"Wealth Files\\" or principles for attaining wealth.  These are all good, if not particularly new, insights and are valuable even as reminders.  He refers to his seminar many times, pulling anecdotes and examples from them.  That is OK, but it tends to get old.  There is no detailed advice on exactly HOW to gain wealth (other than his general recommendation to purchase real estate), but rather, how to mentally gear up for the process. <br /> <br />This is a good motivational book and most readers should find something to think about. <br /> <br />The only reason I gave this 4 stars is that he plugs his seminar a lot.  A LOT. <br />
B00064AM6C|4.0|If you are a White Stripes fan who did not really feel the new record, I've gotta tell you something. If you do not own \\"Under Blackpool Lights\\" then I've gotta tell you to buy it because, for one thing, I really shouldn't have to need anything to back it up with, but if you really want to know why someone would, well here's why: <br /> <br />It's got all of the stuff that the Stripes did before that album. Besides, there are some things that are worthy of being seen. I thought the guitar solo on the studio version of \\"Ball and Buscuit\\" was great, but listen to this on the DVD. It's amazing how it sounds on here. That is one of the reasons you should buy it. <br /> <br />If you're a casual fan, don't worry. Even though Jack doesn't ever perform his stateside breakthrough, most of the hits are performed anyway. I really like the drum clicking of \\"The Hardest Button to Button\\" and the crowd seemed excited too. Also performed was easily their most popular song ever, \\"Seven Nation Army\\". It's performed basically how you'd expect. But then again, this live DVD was pretty much what I expected. <br /> <br />Even when the electric piano is used like in \\"Apple Blossom\\" or the organs on \\"Truth Doesn't Make a Noise\\", he doesn't forget to rock with the guitar. <br /> <br />You also get two Son House covers in a row (both faithful in that they are both done very bluesy), the great \\"Jolene\\" rendition (which you may have heard), as well as covers from obscure bands who only really were known in their local areas. <br /> <br />There's also the big morph they have after the first two songs, which includes covers of Bob Dylan and Ledbetter. There's also two original Stripes songs in that mix as well as another cover. <br /> <br />It did not thrill me like the Cure's \\"Trilogy\\" DVD, but nothing really does to be honest. It just gets a four because for whatever reason I feel that there was something missing, I don't really know what it was. I don't know if the DVD I had was the problem,but the sound quality was even a bit rough for my tastes in general. But I don't understand how you won't like this if you like the White Stripes.

I have had Wheels of Fire as my \\"Cream-fix\\" go-to for the last couple of decades and hadn't paid much attention to this until the remastered came out. <br /> <br />It is a little surprising that that there are more rock/pop tunes than standard blues songs on the album. <br /> <br />However, most of the songs are great and \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\" is still in my Top 10 of all time. <br /> <br />It's too bad they broke up, because Jack Bruce is really a much better singer than Clapton.

B0009MAP9A|5.0|As early as his third album Dylan started showing signs of the changeling artist that we know today. And we all know that he kept on changing and changing throughout the years. In fact, for Dylan the times never stopped changing. It remains true today.<br /><br />Dylan's previous album from 1963, \\"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\", was funny and rollicking in places. The lighthearted struck a good balance with the morose. 1964 saw a new album with a totally new mood. \\"The Times They Are A-Changin'\\" shot wildly to the morose side of the spectrum. It contains mostly down and out stories of tragedy and \\"world gone wrong\\" tales. Nothing here inspires laughter or joy. The still very young Dylan weaves lyrics and tunes with the sensibility of one who has \\"seen it all and is sick of it\\". Regardless, this album remains one of Dylan's greatest albums, though its darkness may not appeal to everyone.<br /><br />Dylan does his best Woody Guthrie impersonation on the cover (the photo almost completely mimics an early photo of Guthrie). To get a sense of just how much Dylan looked up to Guthrie, read Dylan's own \\"Chronicles, Vol. 1\\". There he speaks about the first time he heard Guthrie's music. He may as well be speaking about the rapture. The experience changed Dylan forever, and had a lasting influence on his music. \\"The Times Are A-Changin'\\" represents the pinnacle of that influence. One could almost call it a tribute to Guthrie's legacy (though admittedly Guthrie also had a well developed lighthearted side). Guthrie's own \\"Dust Bowl Ballads\\" evokes a similar mood to this album. Both albums take themselves very seriously and succeed incredibly.<br /><br />This album put Dylan right in the spotlight of the then burgeoning folk-protest music movement. It's not hard to see why with calls to social revolution such as the title song. Many since have appropriated this song to their own ends. But it still remains Dylan's own. He continues to play it on tour in many forms and arrangements. \\"With God on Our Side\\" explores the history of the United States and the killing it did under the banner of \\"God\\". \\"One Too Many Mornings\\" seeps with weariness of life. \\"Only A Pawn in Their Game\\" explores power and class: the exploiters and the exploited and those who use people as a mere means to selfish ends. \\"Boots of Spanish Leather\\" uses the melody of \\"Girl From the North Country\\" to a different end. \\"The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carol\\" revisits class and exploitation. A rich man gets off with a paltry penalty for killing one of his maids. The closing song, \\"Restless Farewell\\", mournfully expresses retribution and acceptance of the world as it is. It's an appropriate close to an album filled with stories about some of the worst life and civilization have to offer.<br /><br />Following the dismal themes and yearning music of \\"The Times Are A-Changin'\\" Dylan turned slighty toward the humorously ridiculous on his next album. He never again made an album as seriously world weary as this one (though some defintely come close). Not only that, this album stands as his folk/protest swan song. In just one more year Dylan would appear with an electric band and get booed for his adventurousness. And then his lyrics started to take on more abstract, opaque, and poetic themes. In short, he soon began to move away and alienate himself from the folk scene. According to \\"Chronicles, Vol. 1\\" he had succeeded a little too well with the protest crowd. Some people started referring to him as \\"saviour\\". They demanded that he lead them. Dylan simply (and understandably) didn't want the job. So he left his main fan base and a few incredible albums behind him (and soon found a new fan base who listened to his new incredible albums).<br /><br />\\"The Times They Are A-Changin'\\" remains one of the high points of Dylan's early acoustic \\"phase\\" that stretched from the beginning of his career to roughly 1965. It's constructed solidly and a theme with an unmistakable undertone runs throughit. Whether people agree or disagree with its message in the end it inspires thought about some of the issues that affect all of us even to the present day.s through it.

B00026YO36|5.0|What makes Bubblegum the best album Mark Lanegan has ever made is the consistency. EVERY SONG is good. The whole album doesn't sound the same either,like in some previous albums,and the music is more sincere.He truely puts down what he feels.Theres an array of emotions to say the least. Every song is completly diverse from the one before it. Some have powerfully driven rythms, with  screaming guitars . And the next song will have slow, consentrated,straight out beautiful music  with perfectly synchronized  vocals and heart-felt lyrics. The visions Lanegan can make you see with his words are truely amazing.There's no way to describe an album like this.  You've got to heard it and review it for yourself. The more you listen to it the the better it gets. It's that good. Star tracks include Morning Glory Wine, Head, Hit the city and Strange Religion .
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Aight, so to all you people who say this is a one star album, you either don't know what good musicianship is, or are just plain ignorant. I am a HUGE fan of Waking the Fallen, and this album is right up there with it. Just because M.Shadow can't scream anymore doesn't take away anything from the band. I think this album shows how they are able to adapt to situations out of their control. The guitar and drumwork are unbelievable. It's fast, its aggressive, its tight, and it's different. It is a great breath of fresh air from all the generic metal bands out there nowadays. So although no, there isn't going to be the screaming as in past albums, this cd is full of great hard rock tunes that you can enjoy.
B00000J2PH|5.0|I absolutely love the Tapestry cd. It brings back great memories! Carole King is my all time favorite.

B00006AFUR|5.0|First and foremost let me start off by saying that by most of my standards this is not a five star CD. Normally that is a mark that I only save for excellence and this is not a piece of perfection. However, I feel that it is only fair to keep in mind that this is an actor picking up an instrument, and attempting to make music. After all for every J Lo there is an Eddie Murphy, Don Johnson or a...Dogstar (uuggh). There isn't a huge amount of originality here, much like Jared's acting, but it is very entertaining, and in the end that is all that really matters. Most of the people even looking at this site are probably drawn here because of Jared in the first place so let me comfort everyone's nereves and say that, yes, in fact he can sing. Actually the album sounds a lot like Earshot's first release, which was then compared to tool, but in no way to I think that 30 seconds to mars sounds like tool. I have far too much respect for tool to compare them to something that easy. Anyways, there is nothing amazing on this album, but every once in a while you get into one of those moods where this album just sounds awesome...I am in one of those moods as I write this now. It's a fun listen so if you like the samples pick it up used. Thank you for your time.

1592400876|5.0|I have never enjoyed reading a book about punctuation before.  Lynne's approach will make understanding and learning about correct usages much easier.  This should be required reading for High School students and then again in College.  It has made me a far better writer.

1400032717|5.0|Although a couple events in the book were predictable, I enjoyed this book more thoroughly than just about any book I've ever read.  I was fascinated by the accurate description of a young boy trying to work things out without \\"normal\\" references the rest of us use.  That we were so consistently introduced into his world, with flashes of how things appeared to others was brilliant.  so many books attempt to achieve this sort of perspective and fail -this one was a home-run.  I would recommend this book to anyone seeking something truly unique, thought-provoking, and enjoyable.
6305633177|5.0|This dvd is one of the best in metallica's great collection of dvd's, it is amazing footage of metallica in the 80's and cliff burton at his best. The video and sound quality could have been better but the passion of the early metallica was defanitley there.
B000AL730O|5.0|As I sat to read what others had to say about this new collection of music from Paul McCartney, it struck me as funny that we often rate our likes and dislikes on scales from 1 to whatever number seems to convey greatness. 5 is a good enough number, I suppose. 4 and 3/4 may have been better, or perhaps 4 and 2/7. Either way, numbers can't fully express to me or you or him or her the way I feel about this record. In fact, neither can words. Each time I think of how to describe any one of these songs, the words that instantly and constantly come to mind are 'gorgeous,' 'haunting,' 'atmospheric,' and occasionally 'ethereal.' But those aren't good enough for me; something is missing. The feelings created by these songs are much more complicated than any of those words on their own. Nonetheless, I must try to explain it.     It seems to me that after one has digested this album once, twice, or any number of times, they either feel completely amazed or apathetic (some even hate it, I suppose). It's fascinating to see the near split of opinion regarding this obviously different (or obviously banal, depending on who you ask) collection of McCartney songs. I'm one of those who found this record to be incredibly striking and fabulous in all areas, though most notably in its structure and sound quality. It's almost entity-like in the way it flows along, morphing into different facets of different moods from song to song. There is a great sense of cohesion to it all once it's over, and that impression is only deepened after repeated listening. As has already been noted numerous times, each consecutive listen seems to reveal more of what's actually happening until its sound and atmosphere has seduced you to the point of complete captivation. Of course, this hasn't and won't happen to everyone, but it certainly is a mysterious ride to experience.     Perhaps the feeling of cohesion stems from the constant quality from song to song. Some are better and more seizing than others, but none stand out as skip-worthy or generally bad (if there is such a thing). Not often do you find that in an album, so it's refreshing to experience this piece of work in its entirety (and actually forget about the skip button!). My only complaint concerns the synthetic drums playing throughout and underneath the actual drums in \\"This Never Happened Before\\" -- it detracts from the song's beauty somewhat and makes me wonder what it would sound like without any percussion whatsoever.     Lyrically, though it may not be the most breathtaking thing you'll ever hear, there are definite moments of clever phrasing and incredible imagery, and if you know Paul's personality well enough, you'll note his ability to convey tongue-in-cheek humor like no one else.     ..More words that come to mind but still don't quite hit the nail hard enough are 'thought-provoking,' 'sensitive,' 'mature,' and 'delicate.' 'Brilliant' may just be the best blanket statement of all, because (to me) there's something about it that shouts the word. This brilliance may simply lay in the small things, such as the mood-changing instrumental break dividing \\"At the Mercy,\\" or the bass piano keys pounding away in the fascinatingly dark conclusion of \\"How Kind of You\\"; the fade and reappearance of strings in \\"Riding to Vanity Fair\\"; the erratic harp at the end of \\"This Never Happened Before\\"; the harmonies and warmth on \\"A Certain Softness\\"; the chill-inducing \\"ahh-ah-ah-ah\\"s in \\"Anyway\\" ... just to name a few.     ...I've probably gone on for too long at this point, but I'm finding it easy to get carried away. I'm thankful to Paul McCartney and everyone responsible for bringing this music to the world. Each person will approach this album differently -- whether it be on varying levels of enthrallment or various levels of dislike -- as we all have different experiences for these songs to speak to. It will speak louder to some more than others. Anyone expecting good old fashioned rock and roll here may very well be disappointed (as already expressed). We all know that Paul, if anyone, is capable of giving us just that, why not try to explore his offering of something different? Creativity is creativity in any form, and here it's used to make something exceptionally beautiful.
B0007GAERG|5.0|It's funny because I have never really been a huge Mariah Carey fan, but this album really made me a fan! This is absolutely one of the greatest albums this year. Of course she is going to win many awards at the end of the year for this album, and she truely deserves it. There is a wide variety of material on this CD including production from Kanye West, Jermaine Dupri and the Neptunes. My favorite song on here is \\"Stay The Night\\" because her vocals are outstanding. It is a perfect mid-tempo which is reminiscent of something Beyonce would sing. My other favorite on here is \\"Say Somethin\\" with Pharell and Snoop Dogg because it is a great laid back type of song that you can drive to. Everyone should have this album, and over 3 million already do:) <br />
B0002N4ZEW|5.0|I got this on my travels in Finland and have been quietly impressed by the music on it. As has been mentioned here, Porcupine Tree seem to be the middle ground between The Orb and Pink Floyd which is no bad thing. The music is very light, airy and definitely trippy too ( without the need of any psychedelic drugs I may add too ). I quite enjoy the random dialogue snippets as this makes it seem/sound a bit more of a scientific experimentation set to music. If you do like your psychedelic music more musically trippy than lyrically - this is as good a place to go for your dosage.
B000065V3H|5.0|I love this film. Dempsy is excellent as Ronald as is Peterson's Amanda.   No matter what clique you were in at H.S. you can identify with this flick. As stated in another review the scene near the end when Ronny confronts one of the jocks at the lunch table is outstanding. That part alone should be mandatory viewing for all incoming H.S. freshmen.
B000AADYYO|5.0|First off, PLEASE stop with the comparisons to Tool!!!  Tool doesn't even compare with Opeth.  Opeth blows them out of the water. <br /> <br />With that said, onto my review. <br /> <br />Ghost of Perdition 10/10 - This song reminds me of Deliverance in so many ways, but since Deliverance is probably the greatest heavy metal song ever, it's really not fair to compare them.  Classic death growls (Mikael should hold a clinic on the Death Growl), beautiful acoustic work, strong drumming...everything one would expect from an epic Opeth tune.  Probably the best song on the album. <br /> <br />Baying Of The Hounds 9.5/10 - The highlight of this song for me is the ethereal keyboards that lead into a discordant electric guitar passage at about the 3.5 minute mark.  Well crafted lyrics.  The brutal growl followed up by a tearing riff at the 6:20 mark has me banging my head with every listen.  Awesome. <br /> <br />Beneath The Mire 9/10 - The opening keyboards in this song kind of bug me a little bit.  Not one of the stellar moments in the album, but it straightens itself out momentarily at about the :45 mark, then back to the same annoying boards again.  Then at the 1:45 mark, the boys tear into what is probably the most vicious, brutal passages on the album.  Mike, you kick ass dude!  The beautiful piano/guitar passage at 3:25 marks an awesome contast to the violence that directly preceeds it.  IMO, the song should have ended at 7:10, but they drone on for another 50 seconds or so with weird keyboards that just don't seem to fit somehow. <br /> <br />Atonement 9.5/10 - A unique go of it, even for a band that loves to experiment with new sounds and textures.  The bass is the highlight of the song for me.  Some simple, interesting \\"hand\\" drummming is a nice change of pace as well.  The main guitar theme has a spacey, happy feel to it that defines Opeth's drastic mood changes. <br /> <br />Reverie/Harlequin Forest 9.5/10 - A little slow until the 2:30 mark when the death growls kick in.  This song has the best lyrics on the album as far as I'm concerned. \\"You are the laughing stock Of the absinthe-minded...\\"  The guitar passage from the 6:00 to 7:20 mark is reminiscent of the layered guitar parts from Damnation.  Again they may have strectched this song out a little long, or I would have given it a 10. <br /> <br />Hours Of Wealth 10/10 - The first time I played this album I repeated this song probably 10 times.  The opening 2:24 of this song may be the most beautiful thing Opeth has ever done, maybe even more beautiful than Benighted or Patterns In The Ivy (and that's saying a lot).  the vocals that kick in at this point are a bitter, heartwrenching plea of loneliness that only Mikael could interpret appropriately.  The closing 1:30 has a melancholy guitar solo over a somber keyboard part that cements the sadness and despair of this song. <br /> <br />The Grand Conjuration 10/10 - If any song on this album was going to \\"scare\\" away the faint of heart, this is it.  This song just has evil written all over it.  At 1:40, the bass drum kicks in with quarter notes that really get the song moving.  If you don't find yourself moving at this point, check your pulse cuz you might be dead.  Another highlight of this song is the light whispers that sometimes come in atop the main vocal, and add a touch of doom to the already sinister overtones of the song.  This is \\"heavy\\" Opeth at it's best. <br /> <br />Isolation Years 10/10 - I can't find anything negative about this truly beautiful, moving song.  Mikael's \\"clean\\" vocals have never been better.  A soaring, ethereal guitar part over the chorus adds to the emotion, and could bring even the toughest soul to tears. <br /> <br />I won't say this is Opeth's best album, because it's pointless to compare brilliance to brilliance.  These guys can do no wrong as far as I'm concerned.  This is a must have for all Opeth fans, and if you are new to the band, it's not a bad place to start.  I wouldn't startwith Damnation though, because although it's brilliant, it isn't repesentative of what Opeth's all about.  Enjoy!
B0002OERI0|1.0|This CD is all about politics. Sorry, I don't want government lessons in my rock music. If I wanted a Fu*k Bush book then I would've bought one. Stay away, buy Dookie if you don't have it already. If you do, avoid this overly political garbage like the plague.
6305075379|4.0|This is a lower budget film.  The thing that makes this film memorable is that it was the first (or one of the first) movies with this theme.  the thing that also makes it so good is that becides having crazy people causing violence (that guys like) it also has emotions.  The feelings of rage and retaliation are understood by people watching. <br /> <br />Many movies have tried to copy this film, but they failed.  The main reason, I think, is because they focused on the violence part of it and forgot about writing thier films so people can agree with the feelings expressed by the main charictor. <br /> <br />I think this movie is a low budget clasic.
B00025ETIW|5.0|This is a great emo-rock CD. The drum player is good and the vocalist is great but what really blew me off was the guitar player...amazing. This album is amazing. What makes me mad about other reviews is two things. One is the MTV thing, yeah 85% of waht they show is fake but not ALL of it baffons. And the songs aren't ALL about love, actually barely any are. Some say \\"Helena\\" is about a girlfriend the singer is obsessed about but this is not true it is about the singer's grandma dying, ok. Get a life, please. Another thing you should get is this CD, it's fantasic. Buy it!
B000084T18|4.0|So far, so good. This CD is great. I have listened to the first 7 songs, and overall I enjoyed them. All of them, some more than others, have a great beat, great lyrics, great sound effects, and the lead rapper has a great voice. If you think I like this album, imagine how much I'll love the one called \\"The Massacre\\"! Anyway, I  plan to listen to the other songs soon, and then I will really be proud of myself for buying this extraordinary record of band rap.
B00005JODA|5.0|Excellent political thriller that is moving, scary and griping all at the same time. Fernando Meirelles creates atmosphere of intrigue, paranoia and haunting beauty that will knock your socks off. Rachel Weisz delivers the best performance by any actress in the last few years with a haunting, strong and human heroin that is an inspiration and her story is a combination of strong will and uncanny passion. Rachel Weisz has not only raised the bar in acting prowess this year but I don't think I will see another performance like it. If she is not nominated for an Oscar, then there is something wrong. Ralph Fiennes also shines with his role that is a complex look into a man who has to find out not only who his wife was but also to see who he really is. Fiennes makes his characters plight more than a quest for justice but a quest for inner peace and he just blows you away with his performance. Pure and simple, movies don't get any better than this, and this is in my mind the best we had all year long.  <br />

There also is some comic relief displayed by Reno and Rude, who I can acually laugh at when they're dumb.

B0000255CL|4.0|This truly is an album worth the extra money. <br /> <br />Some people have said that Immortal has crossed the line from black metal to viking metal with this one. I personally don't consider this to be 'viking' metal. Amon Amarth or Einherjer would better fit that description. However, on this release, Immortal manage to shrug off some of the stereotypical features of 'true' black metal and come up with their own sound, which by all means is quite impressive.  <br /> <br />Immortal has quite a distinction between every album they put out, and this album is no different. What really sets this apart is the length of the songs. Each song is more than 6 minutes long, I believe. Despite the songs' length, the riffs are never overused; the songs are interesting throughout. Their previous album, 'Blizzard Beasts', had 9 songs and was only about 28 minutes long, if I remember correctly. With only 6 songs clocking in at about 45 minutes, this album really is quite a jump for the Immortal guys. Nevertheless, each song has enough body to stand on its own as a true pleasure to enjoy. <br /> <br />While all 6 tracks on this album are true gems, my personal favorite would have to be 'Years of Silent Sorrow'. Try listening to it in the dark on a freezing night, or driving through the snow. It just makes me want to put on my corpse paint and pose for pictures in the woods.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|Highly recommend this as a companion to the DVD.  CD contains two songs that are from the live performance at the Helix Center in Dublin.  Wonderful modern feel to some old Irish classics as well as beautiful show tunes.  The ladies sing with voices of angels and you will not be disappointed.
B0009KA7BS|5.0|CONSTANTINE is an amazing, powerful and imaginative film. It is surreal and dark.  It feels like a weird dream you can't wake up from that makes you really  look at the feelings/actions in your own life that you fear.    I don't know the comic book and I don't believe in Heaven and Hell. WE create that in our own lives,  and we get stuck in it. I feel that's one of the themes in this film.  Many of the demonic images of fiery worlds of suffering  we create for ourselves.    Not every culture shares these images  or punishing beliefs.      Keanu Reeves is brilliant in this movie. The characters he plays are almost  trance channelers for other realities -  like Kabuki players or Shamans.      I love how extreme this film is. There is a fluid energy that the characters move in  and out of that is also disturbing and intense.  There are a lot of films  and tv shows now  about the occult and psychic phenomena and  spiritual experiences.  CONSTANTINE is a fascinating journey into our fears and beliefs.    I give Keanu and all the actors and Director high marks in excellence to go into  these dark and murky places that already exist within us. Awesome movie !
B0007M22TI|5.0|David Downes is a genius at arranging.  The songs have a modern feel to old Irish classics.  The ladies all have voices of angels and David made sure they were featured on their best songs.  Superb concert and great camera work to capture this wonderful Irish experience on DVD.
6302517036|5.0|It's about time Dracula had a modern makeover, and this film does it with style. Parts of the story are fun and campy, but it's serious and scary enough for me. Dracula is suave and seductive; one could imagine wanting to be bitten by him, and there's a surprisingly erotic scene in a disco of all places. Roddy McDowall plays the part of a late-night television horror film emcee, and he adds a nice touch as he haplessly helps his young friends defeat Dracula with his \\"vampire kit.\\" This is a good film to sink your teeth into.
B000003S5H|5.0|This is the best of the Air albums, fantastic! Great for almost any mood, for home or car, or subway... relaxing and provocative at the same time:))) Have to have it!
0783226837|5.0|Do you want to laugh and scream? Then Tremors is the horror film for you. Val and Earl (Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward) make a funny dynamic duo, and there are other quirky characters besides. You'll need the humor, too, because there's plenty of nail-biting and heart-pounding action as this small group goes up against a truly original and dangerous monster. This film will make you afraid of the desert as Jaws made you afraid of the ocean. One caveat: do yourself a favor and do not watch any of the lousy sequels.

B00028HBKM|1.0|After so many glorious and watered-down depictions of the Passion, I was looking forward to a wrenching but realistic version - more historically accurate. But Gibson swings the fictional pendulum toward gratuitous and graphic violence, and the story as well as Jesus get flayed to a bloody mess. Gibson's vision may be powerful, but it's as deeply flawed as his previous films that have played fast and loose with American and Scottish history.
B000A88EV4|3.0|Brilliant British direct Mike Leigh's \\"Naked\\" was one of the boldest films of the 1990's -- an utterly compelling and completely harrowing look a the life of unemployed drifter Johnny as he makes his way through the streets of London.  He stays a while with a former girlfriend, seduces her roommate and engages in philosophical and existential conversations with people he meets.    Everything you have heard about the performance of David Thewlis as Johnny is true, and then some.  There is not a false note in it and it is a mesmerizing turn that sustains itself in the memory long after the two hour movie is over.  It is probably that flawlessness that caused him to be overlooked by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences come nomination time.  To have played such a gruff and unpleasant character must have made it difficult for Academy members to separate the actor from the character.  Compare his performance here with the one his is probably best known for (Professor Lupin in \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\") and be prepared to be blown away.    Having said all of this I must qualify things.  This movie is *NOT* for everybody.  It is stark, vicious, and deals with unpleasant characters and subject matter.  Those who have not seen it, therefore, might want to proceed with caution.  This movie will haunt and disturb you.  It isn't without its moments of humor (note the conversation Johnny has with the security guard about the universal product code) but overall this is very gritty and very uncommercial drama.  Hats off the Critereon for giving the film an American DVD release and may it do the same for more Leigh films.    3 1/2 stars
B000001FRY|5.0|Boy is U2's best album, War, October, and Unforgettable Fire are awesome too, but Boy is the best. Any hardcore fan like myself knows this. Every track on Boy is killer, you can just get lost in Twilight, Un Cat Dubh, Shadows and Tall Trees, the list goes on and on. Great album, and what more is so amazing is that when they recorded it they were barely out their teens. Excellent album the best anywhere.
015603008X|5.0|Ok, so my name isn't really Bob Dole. But as a retarded, quadripeligic gay man, I can say this book a real winner. I've never had such feeling (no pun intended) in my whole life. I'm so glad my teacher made me read this book. I read it fifteen times in two weeks while the rest of my friends were out around town having fun with their \\"friends.\\" Oh well. Flowers for Algernon is the only friend I need. My life is great...so great.
B0006399FS|3.0|U2 is doing the right thing with this release many of the songs sound like they could be on their first albums. Crumbs From Your Table sounds like it could be on Boy, October, War or Unforgettable Fire, so does All Because of You, an excellent song with the Edge jamming on the guitar. Overall the album can't touch the masterpieces like Boy, October, or War, buy hey U2 is such a unique band, also amazing in concert too see. As a lifelong fan looking forward too their next album and I hope they keep moving back too their original, unique sound like on Boy, October, War and Unforgettable Fire.
B000A78Z82|5.0|Well, Devendra is certainly growing year by year, this fifth album seems at the first listening a much more mature work with a soft and relaxed happiness, showing a huge group spirit: laughs, people talking in the back, noises, handclaps, organic sounds and a lot of instruments, including the electric ones (\\"Little Boys\\" is a fine example, with that...weird lyrics, almost surfing at the guitar!!).  <br />His spanish is delightful (in fact, at the start of the second song, \\"Santa Maria da Feira\\", he talks a little of portuguese...Santa Maria da Feira is the name of a portuguese small town with a medieval castle!) and I get a comparison with some of the atmosphere of Incredible String Band (not only for the cover, too \\"Hangman's Beautiful Daughter\\" or, if you wish, too \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\"), also the acoustic-getting-electric side of Bob Dylan (for instance, the song \\"I Feel Just Like a Child\\" hung up with a Dylan-esque flavour) or the \\"Gift From a Flower to a Garden\\", the lovely double album from Donovan... but gone is Nick Drake!!! There is no sadness or the melancholic prostration of the author of \\"Five Leaves Left\\", the album lives of kindred spirits, almost a fairy-like ambiance, sensuous percussion and sunset guitars... It is fluid, the songs are memorable (\\"Inanel\\", gentle-spooky nightfall lullaby, a must in the folk music!) and not weird (maybe his voice, only sometimes) this is not that weird folk music or else, well, like the spendid \\"sung Tongs\\" of Animal Collective... This is a much more kind-of-a-porcelain fragile music made by a man-child and a lot of in-the-same-spirit guests with a natural innocence, people who like to walk in the woods or stay the night at home, by the fire; people that are so far away from the city sickness...with, perhaps, a cure for life...
B00006AFUR|5.0|As the title of my review implies, actor lead bands DO NOT SUCK!! 30 Seconds to Mars may be the only prime example of a actor lead band that does not seem to follow the same dismal path as other former actor turned musicians have come across.  <br /> <br />As I listened to their self titled album, I realized that they have a sort of space age sound. It is definately alternative, but it maintains some heavy influences. Each track on the CD has unique qualities that make each track different from the rest. Each track also maintains the space age sound which is subtly implied in the name of the band.  <br /> <br />With the first go around of the CD, I was already pleased. I found myself liking such tracks as \\"Echelon.\\" Echelon seems to have a sort of jungle like feeling. Echelon gives the drummer, Shannon Leto, a chance to shine. Other songs such as \\"Oblivion\\" which has a more heavier feel to it, makes one appreciate the band even more. Each track differs and has its own unique sound, but all in all its a great CD.
B00005NRN9|4.0|The story is a little strange, but the music and performances really make up for it. The cinematography is exceptional. I saw Journey of Man at IMAX in 3D and went looking for this one to add to my DVD collection.

1932100385|1.0|The book, while not entirely without value, is not about the China Study, nor is it a comprehensive look at the current state of health research. It would be more aptly titled, A Comprehensive Case for the Vegan Diet, and the reader should be cautioned that the evidence is selected, presented, and interpreted with the goal of making that case in mind. <br />
0060934913|5.0|Mr. Bourdain has strung together, hidden in the form of a memoir, every story anyone who has ever worked in food service has told in some form or another, and done it well.  The antics, the secrets, the drama and melodrama of the kitchen/pantry/freezer, the love/hate relationship between diners and restaurant staff--all of these things are anecdotally exposed in a straightforward and honest mode. <br /> <br />The writing is crisp, although not clean, and extremely easy to read.  You'll find yourself going from chapter to chapter with a promise to turn the light off after the next, and then read on instead.  Entertaining, engrossing, Mr. Bourdain's life and recollections, however accurate or exaggerated, are worth reading for the entertainment value, the nostaglia it instills (in those of us who have worked in some capacity in a restaurant), and the appreciation it might help you have the next time you sit down to a nice meal.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I've been listening to APC from the beginning: Mer De Noms was brilliant, an amazing album, and Thirteenth Step was even better.  It's been two years since I bought it, and I'm still listening to it like I just got it, each time liking it better and better.  It's one of those cds that I said was good at first, not exactly sure what I thought of it, and then song by song it grew on me.  Now, I'm convinced it's one of the best in the last several years.   <br />    APC's music is dark, melodic, beautiful, and heavy (but without neglecting its softer side, too).  DON'T think that they're just a hard rock band, cause they're definitely NOT!  In a way, they're kind of the darker cousin of Jane's Addiction and the lighter sibling of Tool, caught somewhere inbetween the two of them.  This is Art Rock at its best.  The cd is great from end to end, my favorites being Vanishing, The Outsider, The Nurse Who Loved Me (absolutely beautiful, but morbid) and Gravity. <br /> <br />If you like this one, get MER DE NOMS!
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|What can I add to all the positive reviews! The best release of this year!  I have not stop listening to this since it came out.  (I'm not a huge metal/hard rock fan) but this band transends normal metal/hard rock!  Its Armenian American crazy music....with insane lyrics one minute and lyrics that rip america to the core in the time of \\"son of a bush\\" System you guys rock!  I wish this band would do a track with Public Enemy!
B0002XVQNU|4.0|First i have to say this. If you are expecting a story or hero like Spider-Man, you are in for a shock. <br />The directors cut of Daredevil is one of the best directors cuts i have ever seen. Not only does the plot have more substance with the addition of deleted scenes, but also ties up plot holes as well. There was also a whole subplot about blind lawyer Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck) and Foggy Nelson (Jon Faverou) defending what looks like a guilty client, played by the 90s rapper Coolio. <br />In this cut, you see more Matt Murdock, and you can actually see why Mark Steven Johnson chose Affleck to play the blind vigilantie. When i first saw the original version, i htought that Affleck was ok. But after this, i can say that Affleck was the perfect choice for Daredevil/Matt Murdock. <br />But still i have to say that Collin Farrell as Bullseye steals the show. Not only did he play him to a tea, but he also made Bullseye a more interesting character than he is in the comic series. <br />The R rated director's cut also has a more grittier, dark edge to the film, compared to the PG 13 rating that the original version has. Expect more graphic fight scenes, and plenty more swearing by the characters.  <br />Overall, I must say that this cut definitly does justice to fans of the comic. If you dont have this in your collection, get it. <br />This DVD also has a good mini documentary about how the directors cut was made.
B000AL730O|5.0|McCartney has been on a winning streak since Flaming Pie (I think he started to hit his stride again in 1988 with Flowers in the Dirt)....This release is a slightly new Direction for McCartney and the pairing of Him and producer Nigel Godrich....its perfect!  Godrich cuts through the smultz that can sometimes over whelm Mac's records.....he even stopped Paul from singing songs he didn't like! (according to the bonus DVD). <br />This record is mellow and it takes a few spins to grow....once it does you will agree, its McCartney still on top!!! <br /> <br />GET THIS NOW!
B000002J1O|5.0|One of the best albums ever made, if not the best. I'm not big prog-fan but still? This is something no one shouldn't miss. <br />Just buy it if you're reading this :P
0224071262|1.0|This biography is flawed and extremely baised.  As someone who has also grew up in the cultural revolution, I have experienced many of the things described in the book first hand.  One of the many reasons Mao initiated the Cultural Revolution was because he felt that his power influence was not as wide and stable as 10 years ago, and in order to reestablish his goverance, he had rid him of political enemies.    Why do I bother defending Mao if he is such a 'wicked' man who, according to the book, send half of China to extinction?  First, without Mao there would be the no new China, and without China's resistance towards Japan, the whole China would have gone to extinction.  The author of the book obviously wishes to look past all of this, as he is more interested in blaming Mao from a self-centered view.  So he was sent to the rural villages, weren't us all?  Anyone with any wisdom would understand that even if given so, the cultural 'reeducation' actually improved the proverty and the education of the countryside by bringing the intelllcturals out of the urban areas.  The CR curtailed the dispairty between the intecllctural and the countryside, bring the people of China as a whole together.    Sounds too good to be true? You say, accuse me being a propgandaist.  But if you actually examine reason and use logic, didn't the cultural revolution accomplish this by bring the two sides of people together    What of the 'mass murders'?  What of Mao's quotes?  I swear I rememeber Mao saying that he wanted to use the airforce against the intellcturals and drop bombs on cities that he felt were disobident.  If you ignore true history and want only to believe what you want to believe, this book accomplishes excatly that.  It involves a Chinese person who did *not* experience the cultural revolution write a book on the cultural revolution and claim what he wants to claim and make up facts to support his argument.      Is Mao a good person?  On the whole, I would not say so.  But is Mao the monster protrayed here that China could have been better without, no.  I dare you to interview real people who has experienced the cultural revolution, I dare you to learn of the real truth and not the fiction that makes up this book.
B000002IST|5.0|Firstly. I just can't understand these guys who give 1 star to this album?=D Even if you only like prog. There are no bad songs in this album. Few unbeliavable breathtaking songs: No son of mine, Driving the last spike, Dreaming while you sleep and Fading Lights. <br />I just want to hear these again and again.
1400032717|5.0|I didn't know what to expect of this book.  I was drawn to it by the fact that it was written from the perspective of an autistic person. I've seen movies about autistic people and they portray them as people with a lot of behavioral problems.  However, the book makes a great job of taking us into the mind and the problem solving processes a person with this condition has.  It lets us peek into all the confusion the world sometimes represents for them.  Things we take for granted, such as knowing what the expression on the face of a person represents or understanding jokes, are things that are difficult or sometimes imposible for them to grasp.  And all of it is given to us as a very well built story.  I'm happy I read this book.
B000002J0B|5.0|...breathtaking album from LZ. But this is the best. So many beatiful and relaxing songs you want to hear again and again.
B0007P3582|3.0|The album is a little to poppy for me but at the same time it has some good tracks.  This album has above average production and less than average lyrics and solid hooks.  It isnt as bad as the umderground, hate every thing popular, 50 haters think it is.  It isn't as good as the teeny bopping, can't spell rap, GGGG-Unit members think it is. It is actually close to a 4 star cd until Candy Stick or Magic Shop whatever its called.  Besides that and Disco \\"On Fire\\" Inferno the album is pretty nice.

B0007GAEW6|2.0|Omar's excesses need reigning in, or he just goes off on meaningless tangents. It's like Morrissey in The Smiths, with Johnny Marr to keep him in line (great), and Morrissey left to his own angst-ridden excesses (self-indulgent, meandering and very uneven). Rick Rubin--the great producer who did the solo Johnny Cash records--kept \\"De-loused\\" on track and made every minute count. I'm afraid this record has gone the way of solo Morrissey records: self-indulgent, meandering and very uneven. 'Tis a pity. Some people's egos just demand that they have a producer to keep them on track. This band is a good example.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A friend of mine had me take a look at this series after I complained that there were no good series on, and when I finally finished watching them all in one long, barely broken marathon, I called him up and asked for the second season. He just sort of laughed and told me \\"yeah, I know what you mean.\\" I was rather heartbroken. <br /> <br />Short-lived though it was, this series was a brilliant concept with perfect execution that just got some bad luck, I guess. In any case, I'll be going to see Serenity ASAP, and praying that the show might get picked up again, against all odds.
B000002BMD|1.0|I don't know much about the history of this band, nor do I care to learn after listening to some of this record. Terribly boring and uninspired. Obvious and tired chord progressions and musicianship. Vocal melodies are the type that come off the very top of your head without putting an ounce of thought into it; the type that are probably the perfect average of every single vocal melody you've ever heard throughout your entire life.
0060763280|5.0|After reading the other reviews, I am willing to bet that the ones with the lowest ratings were written by people who didn't follow through on the exercises or instruction.  <br /> <br />There are all the elements of a system - a financial one - in this book. The simplicity is genius because human nature dictates 'doing the easy stuff and skipping the work.'  <br /> <br />It's most effective coupled with the Millionaire Mind Intensive - the seminar - to enable the reader and participant to create a new 'financial blueprint' in their life. <br /> <br />It's is an easy read with practical clarity from a man who has been there. <br /> <br />But it's really not about the money.  <br /> <br />It's about the 'mind' and a path to personal power in the 21st century - living in the moment - and learning to shed all the stuff that doesn't work in our life and never did.  <br /> <br />This book is a stepping stone in that direction. And it has enabled me to find new direction, purpose and clarity in my life.
B0001WGDX0|5.0|These Beethoven performances are loaded with personal touches. Bernstein's own feelings and thoughts are shamelessly printed on many passages - and it's very moving. For example, try the Mahler-like lyricism of the slow movement of second symphony or the bass-heavy treatment of the 9th symphony's 1st movement. Some fast passages are breathlessly intense. Some lyrical passages are painfully heartfelt. You may not always agree with his choice of tempo but it's not really up to you, is it? There are countless moments where things get very emotional, sometimes at the expense of sonic balance. The singers in the 9th sometimes get too excited they almost sing out of tune. But they sure sound possessed.<br />The recording is clean and natural. I know there are some who will complain about the dry, uneven sound but I think Bernstein himself is the one responsible for that - lack of care on sonic beautification. Again, that's not what Bernstein was shooting for.<br />This is not a spotless, perfection-oriented Beethoven. It has flaws. But who cares when this is the only Beethoven set performed this way?
B00005Q4CS|5.0|i've recently seen this DVD,5 years after the making and up till now it's massive impression is within me.seldom has modern cinema reached such depths of existensialist profundity.it's easy to recognize aronofsky and his dp's technical brilliance and praise it in that line or,on the other hand, dismiss it as too dark and depressive and unbearable,but what i think is that quite contrary to the latter approach,aronofsky, aided effectively by selbert's material,narrates a cautionary tale wherein harsh realism-though not expressed in a totally realistic fashion-serves as a metaphor for irresponsibility towards one's existence,NOT in religious or ethical terms but simply in human terms,in other words aronofsky's movie is in a way didactic,he's telling us this is what happens if you lose belief in yourself,if you sacrify your wisdom and compassion for means of escaping,rather than staying and taking afew blows but remaining on the cycle of existance,as an iranian fellow director icongragulate aronofsky and shake his hand.seeing this DVD(though ihope there will be some additions in the extras in next editons)is a must for any filmmaker or potential filmmaker interested in the dynanics of man.
B0001WTWCO|4.0|This movie has some quite beautiful moments and was quite enjoyable.  Some people will complain that it is too slow, and it   certainly will be for those who prefer drama of the \\"Rambo\\" or Steven Seagal genre or are otherwise unable to appreciate some of its subtleties.  I've heard at least one reviewer complain that the main characters are 'narcissistic' and self-absorbed because they're not worried about the global political implications of their actions or because they are unable to perform the morally correct actions on cue - I'm not sure whether to laugh at this comment or feel pity for the empty life of the person who would make it. <br /> <br />One warning - this film has a strong 'chick flick' component, and some of the overwrought mawkishness of the latter parts of the movie does detract from what are some truly scintillatingly subtle moments, such as when Count Almsy tries to warn Katherine's husband about leaving her with the team in the desert.  What a great, great scene. <br /> <br />This movie does not glorify adultery.  An accurate portrayal of the passions that produce such a liaison should not be confused with sympathy - such portrayals should be viewed as an explanation, not an excuse.  The fact that this illicit love affair ends up destroying everyone that Katherine and Count Almsy hold dear, before it ends up consuming both of them as well should be enough for anyone looking for a morally correct result.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005YW4H|5.0|I received the CD tape \\"Come Away with Me\\", by Norah Jones.  It was recommended by my cousin in San Antonio, TX because she knew that I enjoyed Enja, especially \\"Paint the Sky with Stars\\".  It really like that CD and now I also enjoy \\"Come Away With Me\\", by Norah Jones.  They are both very relaxing tapes that I listen to each night prior to me going to sleep.  I would recommend both CD's to anyone who wants their mind to wander and relax from the the hard day.

B000819PKC|2.0|I can no longer support a group that won't make the effort in expanding and trying different things. Unlike the original incarnation of Jamiroquai...long gone are the days of the crew who were more than just an eclectic group of musicians and imaginative, natural born talents. Now, Jamiroquai has become just another group in passing, painstakingly trying to recapture it's gloys days of the early 90's.    Yet, Dynamite isn't a total disaster. It's highlights include Seven Days In Sunny June, Feels Just Like It Should and Talullah.    However, it's difficult to ignore it's bad points. The songwriting is probably the worst i've heard since j.lo's 'rebirth' album, which i find to be very surprising since jay has always been an excellent writer.    Then there's the music. I have grown sick and tired of their crappy and overly repetative disco/techno hybird sound. It was a neat vibe they jumped off with on synchonized, but then... they took it past it's expiration date on 'A Funk Odyssey' and, then... semi-reheated it on this album.    It's almost as if Jamiroquai isn't quite sure where to take it's direction in music anymore... whereas, it was instantanious in it's early years when ingenuity and imagination allowed jamiroquai to become the litmus test in modern day music.    The hunger is no longer there. The passion is no longer there. They jumped the shark, became rock stars and Jamiroquai has clearly run it's course. And although I'm done supporting them, the memories of thier great catalog of music still remains golden.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|This movie was so darn good I don't even know where to start.  Batman is the \\"dark knight\\" for a reason.  Something that hollywood apparently never decided to notice until two comic book geeks themselves (writer David S. Goyer and director Chris Nolan) were given the reigns to the best comic hero ever.  This movie is phenomenal.  It is the truest, and in my mind, the only, representation of Batman to ever hit the big screen.  What does it do that the others don't?  Many things. <br /> <br />First of all, Batman Begins tells the story of Bruce Wayne.  It doesn't just start him out as some aristocratic loverboy heir like every other movie seemed hellbent on doing.  This movie lets us know Bruce Wayne BEFORE we know Batman.  Knowing the man behind the mask is half the fun when it comes to superheroes and costumed figures.  Without knowing an individual's inspiration for his actions, we're left to just think, \\"wow, this guy is some superhuman weirdo,\\" but this has never been the case with Bruce Wayne.  He is a normal (albeit extremely wealthy and intelligent) human being.  He has no superpowers except his mind and his friends.  He is a person.  Goyer and Nolan captured this perfectly with Batman Begins.   <br /> <br />Secondly, Batman as Batman is more fun than ever before.  Christian Bale is absolutely perfect for both the role of Bruce and Batman.  He is an extremely talented actor who has honed his chops on brooding/buff roles in many of his previous films (see Equilibrium for example...it's basically Batman) and it shows.  Christian brings a life and funness to Batman that was never really there because none of the others actors who have ever played him even knew who Batman was supposed to be.  Christian's Batman is distraught, he's enraged, he's new to the game, and he's fresh and excited to be out doing what he thinks is good.  Bale nails Batman, which lets Batman be the Batman all us comic fans have been craving.   <br /> <br />Finally, not only does this film have an absolutely stellar cast, but it has an amazing plot and great action scenes.  Finally, a story that is interesting, intriguing, and worthy of being turned into a movie.  And for all the comic action fans out there, there is action that is (for the most part) believable and very entertaining.  Of course the Tumbler could probably never really drive on roofs, but come on, it's fun and it actually goes with the plot really well!  Batman Begins is hands-down the greatest comic movie since the original Brandon Lee \\"Crow.\\"  Spiderman 1 and 2 were fun, X2, was a blast, but Batman Begins is a movie.  It's perfectly executed on all accounts and should be viewed by everyone.
B00000GAIW|5.0|Recently i have undergone a bit of a change (Thanks to my guitar teacher/Dad, see i have gone from hiphop to older rock!!! i first song i remeber hearing bits of by Jethro Tull is \\"We Used To Know\\" on there \\"Stand Up\\" album. My guitar teacher gave it to me as a peice. At 1st i thought they were a bit um wierd! What a fool i was. Jethro Tull are so lickable and lovely. The funny thing about them is though that they have died down somewhat, in the sence that older bands like Beatles, Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple Still have a name and alot of younger kids would know or have heard of them before... Im 14. Only about 2 or 3 people in my year at my school would have heard them!!! I think that people have missed out on something special even magical. Now to Aqualung: <br />Aqualung (from what i have heard) was Tull's breakthrough album and its a classic. I must idmit i much prefer Ian's lovely acoustic guitar to Martin's elcectric any day, see the tracks i love on Aqualung are: Wond'ring Aloud, Cheap Day Return and Wind-up. I think Aqualung is a suberb album and is great for any generation. Its also fantastic for young guitar players to play along with... tracks like Wond'ring Aloud and Mother Goose are great (and in some places difficult!) to play on a acoustic guitar. Ian Anderson is a guinious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Since then i have given my Dad for fathers day \\"Minstrel in the Gallery\\" and bought \\"Benefit\\" and they are both great albums!!!!! <br />If your young or middle aged or old Jethro Tull is for anyone and i hope if Tull ever come to Australia again i go to see them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0001LJCPC|4.0|The song where she's punching her way out of the coffin is \\"L'Arena\\", and it is on the CD. But does anyone know the name of the song where she finds bill's house and is walking through with her sword and gun before she meets her daughter?
B00005NGAL|5.0|These people dress up in cats costumes and do live music on stage. The songs are off of old stories that were written way back in the day. They did this stuff back in the 80's traveling around the country at civic centers performing.
B0002OERI0|4.0|...even if their fans are not. (Based on some of the reviews I have seen.) This is an enjoyable collection of songs in several different styles. Play it a few times and don't expect it to be \\"just like their first album\\" and I think you'll find a lot to like about American Idiot.
B00007G207|1.0|The movie is fabulous, however the copy has defects - the DVD slows and stops in some places.
B000001GJU|5.0|I don't need to tell you anything about the music, you'd have to have lived in a cave for your entire life to have never heard this. A few points on the performance - excellent pacing, great sound and the brass in the final movement is room-shaking. A great version for sure, with the added bonus of Smetana's Die Moldau from his symphonic poem, Ma Vlast. Kubelik's and Kertesz's readings of the 9th are probably better and more individualistic, but in terms of sonics this recording blows those out of the water. Expensive but worth every penny.
6301543408|1.0|I'm not sure where to begin but this movie was just horrible! This is easily the worst Star Trek film ever and that's is definitely saying something because to date, it's the only film in the theatrical series I've seen!     Like the other Star Trek films (so I read anyway) this one continues the trend of trying to explore some deep, serious issues. In this case, The Final Frontier tries to answer the question that many people today still ask: is there a God? It's an interesting (if potentially blasphemous) basis for the story but the execution of it onscreen is awful. The plotting is a mess and the aging cast can't do anything to prop the movie up. I was thoroughly unimpressed by the special effects. ILM wasn't available (thanks to Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade) and it looks as if the film was handed over to some second-rate effects house.    The tagline for this movie read, \\"Why are they putting seatbelts in the theaters this summer?\\" I think I know why: So the audience won't walk out of the screening!    Darkhorse86
B000001GXC|5.0|In response to the last reviewer - I would agree that the Berlin is a bit raucous at times, but, c'mon! It's Romantic music! What's wrong with some unrestrained emotion?!?  I find these performances very moving, especially the 3rd symphony (I rate it neck and neck with Maag's version with London Symphony Orchestra). I have no need to defend the music, you've all heard it (especially the Italian). This is Karajan at the height of his powers. In short, at this low price, with this much music on it and with a newly remastered and cleaner sound, it's worth the purchase.
B00005JLEX|5.0|The product was excellent of high quality.  Transaction without incident and shipment timely.
B000001GPX|5.0|For years I swore by Karajan's interpretations of Beethoven's symphonies, especially his 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th and 9th; I own three of his cycles ('63, '77, '82, '63 being the best) including the much-criticized mid-80's digital set, which is unfairly bashed in my opinion. But honestly, after hearing Kleiber's interpretation of nos. 5 and 7, I haven't even touched the Karajan recordings of these pieces. They just gather dust. This really is the recording to get, especially for the 5th (although the 7th is very well done too). His use of pacing and his pinpoint control of the orchestra at every turn keeps this disc churning along in true Beethovenian style. Kleiber also brings a great deal of clarity to the score with his style, and the Vienna Philharmonic plays flawlessly. The recording, cleaned up using DG's original image bit processing, sounds rich and has excellent spatial definition. Not to be missed, especially at this ridiculous price.
6305428271|1.0|If you are interested n this type of story, buy To Sir With Love or Boys Town instead. Dangerous Minds is simply boring and predictable with nothing to make it memorable. There are a couple of decent performances from some of the minor characters but that's not enough to raise it above the sad script and cliche ridden dialogue. <br /> <br />On the other hand, if you have no life experience, are very young or simply have watched very few movies in your life, you might get some enjoyment out of this. It's not really a bad movie, but it's certainly not a good one.
B000088E6D|5.0|To the poster who said Michael Buble needs to get his own voice--my suggestion is to go watch him in concert and you will have more than enough evidence that he has his own style, own voice and own mark on all of these standard tracks! I love his voice, and he loves singing this style of music. It all comes from the heart with Mr. Buble. To listen to his cd is a relaxing, romantic and uplifting experience, but to get the full impact of his voice, see him in concert! He will lift the roof!!
B00004RFFS|5.0|Can't say enough about this film.<br />I have read all of the Vampire Chronicles from Interview up until Memnoch, and I was very excited when I first heard that this movie was being made.<br />The film mirrored the book perfectly with exception to the ending.  No spoilers here, but for those in the know, I felt they did the ending because there was never any hope for making the Vampire Lestat novel into a film.  If they did, it would have to be like three hours long, and they don't do that for horror/dramas.<br />The cast was amazing.  I remember at the time hating Brad Pitt for having to endure watching Legend of the Fall with the girlfriend.  I just didn't see him as a serious actor.  And then I saw his performance as Louis.<br />He was brilliant and I don't think that there is any other actor who could have captured the tortured soul of Louis better.<br />And Tom Cruise. . . .I never liked him before either.  What did a guy who did [...] like Cocktail and Days of Thunder have any right to be granted the role of Lestat?  But he was perfect.  He exactly matched Louis's description of his character and mannerisms.  Although as the readers of the series will know, Lestat is a much different character than in this movie as we later see in the Vampire Lestat.<br />When you saw this movie upon its release and were presented with Kirstin Dunst, you knew instantly that she was going to be a star for generations.  I have never seen, even to this day and even counting Haley Joel Osment's turn in the Sixth Sense and better acting performance in a young person.  Never.  And when you see this film, you have to be in agreement.  To go from playing the part of a nine year-old girl to playing an ageless vampire with the wisdom seen in her many years is a daunting task, and the way she handled it left you with the feeling that she will have much more to show us in her years to come.<br />The only disappointment I had was in Antonio Bandaras.  Armand is supposed to be a teen when he died, not a slightly overweight forty year old.  If I can only find a couple mistakes in an adaptation then I have to say I am pleased.<br />You have to see this movie if you are a Vampire fan.  And even if you are not, this is a great dramatic tale that tells of how precious life is.  A must see.<br /><br />Let's just hope that somebody gets brave and tries to make The Vampire Lestat into a movie with the original cast.overweight forty year old.  If I can only find a couple mistakes in an adaptation then I have to say I am pleased.  You have to see this movie if you are a Vampire fan.

B0009R1T7M|5.0|This is the most interesting new music in a year that has been full of great releases from old and new favorites. It is truely American Classical in the tradition of Copeland and Broadway musicals, reminding me alot of a cross between Frank Zappa, Beck, Peter Gabriel (esp. Genesis era), Kate Bush , and ending with a lovely Steve Reichian inspired droning coda (overall a  dramatic, symphonic, eclectic, and playful composition)<br /><br />From the reviews (again I can thank Amazon listeners for leading me to new tunes) I didn't know if it would live up to expectations or be lame and effete. It exceeded expectations, leaving me interested in more, leaving me pleased to know there is such talent, creativity and joy at play in this world.<br /><br />p.s. I've gone on to get Enjoy Your Rabbit (2**), Seven Swans (3***) and Michigan (4****), which range from slightly tolerable electronic background music to somewhat dull acoustic Christian inspired pastoral washes to the first in his very good State inspired theme series with its collage of interesting, theatric, tender and beautiful moments, but I think Illinoise is the best, as a more balanced, mature, interesting work. This guy is amazingly prolific!
B000000OUE|5.0|White Zombie F'in rules. They are cooler than PANTERA (much respect) and they are definatley more hip than your mamma.<br /><br />This album is no acception to their greatness and should only be played at extremely HIGH volume.<br /><br />I was about twelve years old when this thing came out, they used to play the video for MORE HUMAN THAN HUMAN on MTV back then. Well, at least they did at 2 in the morning. Me and my buddy were watching it for the first time and it just blew our minds away!<br /><br />If you like Rob Zombies solo albums than you most definately have to check out WHITE ZOMBIE.<br /><br />ANYWAY other gems here include ELECTRIC HEAD, REAL SOLUTION, and I ZOMBIE, however thats not to say that the rest of the disc isn't just as nasty.<br /><br />THIS thing burns the wicked, the horror movie clips are just as entertaining on here as they were on LA SEXERCISTO.<br /><br />Its evil metal at its god damned finest. C'mon in.
B000AADYRQ|4.0|My musical taste would probably be described by most people as \\"very eclectic\\" or \\"unfocused\\" or simply \\"weird\\".  My music collection includes the likes of Morrissey, Blink 182, Bowling for Soup, Annie Lennox, The Beatles, Willie Nelson, Conway Twitty, Beethoven, Bach, AC/DC, and others you wouldn't expect to see on the same shelf.  But the further toward the musical fringes you get, the less likely you'll find me listening to it.  For example, metal that gets much heavier than AC/DC is not something I care much for.  I pretty much hate jazz altogether, and I wouldn't listen to Neil Diamond, Barbra Streisand, or James Taylor if you begged me.<br /><br />When I first encountered the name of the band \\"Death Cab for Cutie\\", I pretty much dismissed it offhand.  With a name like that, I figured, they're probably some kind of goth-metal-punk band that sounds like a room full of industrial equipment going at full tilt.  I'm big enough to admit I was wrong.  They sound nothing like that.  In fact, they remind me a lot of the alternative bands I listened to on college radio in the 80's and 90's.  I felt very much at home and comfortable with them, almost as if I'd been listening to them for years.  Their latest album is \\"Plans\\" and was the first Death Cab for Cutie album I'd ever heard.<br /><br />Here's the track list for this one, with my notes on each after listening to it a few times:<br /><br />1. Marching Bands of Manhattan<br /><br />Begins with what sounds like a church organ, then blends into a more mainstream sounding instrumental.  I especially like the poetry of the line \\"Sorrow drips into your heart through a pinhole/ just like a faucet that leaks and there is comfort in the sound.\\"<br /><br />2. Soul Meets Body<br /><br />This reminds me of songs by The Cure, Depeche Mode, and some of the other popular 80's alternative groups.<br /><br />3. Summer Skin<br /><br />This soft ballad talks about having to shed your \\"summer skin\\" and move on to the fall.  Memorable line:  \\"Our brand new coats were so flushed and pale/ Then I knew your heart I couldn't win/ 'cause the season's change was a conduit/ And we left our love in our summer skin...\\"<br /><br />4. Different Names for the Same Thing<br /><br />This is a very slow song, primarily piano and vocals.  After a short interlude it picks up as a pop-sounding song with a touch of what sounds like a xylophone.  This song has probably the weakest lyrics on the album, but the instrumentals are interesting at least.<br /><br />5. I Will Follow You into the Dark<br /><br />This is something of a sad song, telling the story of a couple who has \\"seen everything there is to see/ From Bangkok to Calgary\\" and believe that the ends of their lives are coming soon.  One spouse tells the other \\"If Heaven and Hell decide/ That they both are satisfied/ Illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs/ If there's no one beside you/ When your soul embarks/ Then I'll follow you into the dark.\\"  It's an interesting mix of romantic thoughts and death.<br /><br />6. Your Heart Is an Empty Room<br /><br />This song talks about how losing the one you love is like burning down a house, losing everything  you hold dear, but \\"you shed not a single tear for the things you didn't need/ 'Cause you knew you were finally free\\".  Anyone who's ever lost a love can probably appreciate these lyrics.  Even the end of a painful relationship causes feelings of sadness and loss (like seeing your house burn down), but it also can be a hopeful thing in that your next relationship could be a better one.<br /><br />7. Someday You Will Be Loved<br /><br />This is something of the reverse to the previous song.  The narrator tells us that he left a girl but was sure that someday she would be loved.  He says to her \\"You'll be loved/ Like you never have known/ The memories of me/ Will seem more like bad dreams/ Just a series of blurs/ Like I never occurred\\".<br /><br />8. Crooked Teeth<br /><br />Similar to the last song, this one isabout being in a relationship where there is no love.  The singer tells us \\"you can't find nothin' at all/ if there was nothing there all along.\\"  The song's title comes from looking at a city skyline, with the buildings resembling crooked teeth in someone's mouth.<br /><br />9. What Sarah Said<br /><br />Lyrically, vocally, and instrumentally, this is probably the strongest song on the album.  The basic story can be summed up with these lines from the song: \\"'Cause there's no comfort in the waiting room/ Just nervous pacers bracing for bad news/ And then the nurse comes 'round and everyone lifts their heads/ But I'm thinking of what Sarah said/ That love is watching someone die.  So who's gonna watch you die?\\"<br /><br />10. Brothers on a Hotel Bus<br /><br />This song is probably one of the weaker ones on the album, but that doesn't mean it's a bad song.  It isn't.  It just doesn't have the poetry and emotional power that some of the others do.  It begins with over a minute of instrumentals before the vocals start.  It's basically about getting older and not recognizing yourself in the mirror anymore.  The most memorable part of the lyrics are \\"You may tire of me/ As our December sun is setting/ 'Cause I'm not who I used to be\\"<br /><br />11. Stable Song<br /><br />Just as some of the other songs on the album are piano-heavy, this one is heavy with the sound of a slowly strumming acoustic guitar, lending it something of a relaxing, dreamy quality - like floating along a lazy river in an inner tube.  I can't say that I really \\"get\\" what this song is about.  It talks about starting out with a \\"crippling doubt\\" and suffering a \\"swift defeat\\".  For me, it's the weakest song on the album all the way around.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />In all, I have to say I'm sorry I judged this particular book (band) by its cover (name).  I'm very impressed with the poetic quality of the lyrics, the pleasant but expressive vocals, and the fact that the instrumentals are well done and fit perfectly with the lyrics and vocals.  It's an album I would be happy to put on in the background while I'm working, but equally happy to bring out when I'm feeling like listening to some interesting lyrics.  Few bands I can think of provide me with that combination.  (The only two that spring immediately to mind are Barenaked Ladies and Bowling for Soup... and these guys are that good.)<br /><br />Overall, this album gets an 8.5 out of 10 (with 10 being excellent) from me.  It also focuses my attention on a band I'd never heard before, and makes me want to check out their other albums - which I intend to do.>Similar to the last song, this one is about being in a relationship where there is no love.

B0007Y4TVU|3.0|First off, I want to make something clear to some reviewers who say that since \\"Steal This Album\\" SOAD have gone downhill. Well, \\"Steal\\" was actually not an album, but just a collection of B-Sides and random unreleased songs. I never took it seriously, but still enjoyed it as a whole. That said, \\"Mezmerize\\" was a letdown nonetheless. After hearing BYOB & Cigaro on the radio, I expected a tremendous album. Wow was I wrong. The lyrics and harmonies in this one are just laughable. I understand their political leanings, but there are creative ways of getting your point across - See RATM and Rise Against. Many songs like the 2 Hollywood tracks and Radio/Video just go absolutely nowhere and sound like gimics gone bad. I loved the first 2 SOAD albums because every single song kept you interested and they knew how to balance goofiness with a real message and combine them with blistering riffs and good harmonies. What happened here? Just as with many creative people, they thought that the power of their message would make up for a lack of creativity. Politics and cartoon rock don't quite make sense anymore post 9/11. And Daron signing entire song? Um, no sir I don't like it. Also I generally hate double albums, and this one is no exception. Why couldn't they have chosen the best songs that were written and put together a SINGLE exceptional album? I don't understand the need for the quirky filler tracks, since they add nothing in terms of depth, substance or a real change of tempo. I truly hope SOAD improve with Hypnotize, because otherwise I am going to quickly label them sellouts. It wouldn't be the first time that has happened to a band that I respect(ed). In summary, not a terrible album, but not very memorable either.
0143034901|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in years, right up there with the Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time. It's a wonderfully atmospheric novel, full of interesting characters, strange occurences, weird locales, with a beautifully rendered city of Barcelona, ca. 1950, appearring as a backdrop.<br /><br />Daniel Sempere is the only son of the owner of a used bookshop. They live alone above the shop, Daniel's mother having passed away before the story begins. One day, Daniel's father takes him to a mysterious place, the fabled Cemetary of Lost Books, and invites him to choose a book, with the intention of protecting it for the rest of his life. The book Daniel chooses is, by accident, more endangered than most books. It's a semi-romantic novel titled The Shadow of the Wind, by an obscure novelist from Barcelona named Julian Carax. Carax was the piano player in a Parisian whorehouse by day, and a writer in the evenings, and this was his last and worst-selling novel. Strangely, someone's been roaming Spain and France looking for copies of it or Carax's other books, with the intent of destroying them, typically by burning them. Daniel has taken on more than he knows, and the adventure he's about to embark on will last years.<br /><br />The characters, plot, and incidents of this novel are too many to sing all of their praises here. Suffice it to say that there is much to recommend this book, and it's as near as I've ever seen to flawless. I don't speak Spanish, so I can't tell you how good the translation is in rendering Sr. Zafon's book into English, but I *can* tell you that the finished product Lucia Graves presents to the reader is wonderful. Other reviewers here complain that the prose isn't poetic enough: they must have read a different book from the one I read. I can't sing its praises highly enough.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|this was a very entertaining movie which transports you back to the days when the fate of the world falls into the hand of one courageous hero.  here it is Captain Joe Sullivan or more formerly known as Sky Captain.  He along with his co-horts are required to face the kinds of dangers that you just do not see anymore in the movies, Robots out to destroy New York, and evil scientists who have a quest for world domination.  However, Sky Captain will ultimately save the day, definately a fun movie. If you were a fan of Flash Gordon and heros of the past, this is the movie for you
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly- The Complete Series.  How unfortunate this is the complete series.  This is an incredible series.  It combines all the elements that makes science fiction fun.  There is humor, sex, adventure, intrigue and a wonderful synergy between the cast.  My only hope is for a comeback.  Maybe the Sci Fi channel will pick it up.  If you haven't experienced this wonderful program do so now.  You won't regret it.
B000059S9D|5.0|Porcupine Tree are simply awesome. In the great scheme of things they are without doubt the best Prog band since the great era of Floyd, Yes and King Crimson etc.I only recently discovered them by chance. I lived through the 70's and thought I knew prog rock and oft lamented its sad demise. It is alive and well , though.PT are the living proof!!  <br /> <br />This album, in keeping with all their output, is imaginative, beautifully recorded, bursting with ideas and played a level most other bands only ever dream about.I like the idea of a second disk with additional tracks and live stuff. Basically there is a lot for all fans here. Has anyone thought that in the more reflective songs with piano or acoustic backing that this band is the band Coldplay would want to be if they had this much talent?? Just a thought. There is also some good rock stuff which gives hints of their outstanding 2005 release and even some spacy stuff reminiscent of early floyd. <br /> <br />This album shows how they have developed from a band that clearly signalled its roots in earlier days to the band that exists now - that is a fusion of the heritage that is British Progressive rock with all that has come since. I know of no other band that has done this so well. <br /> <br />A brilliant album from a brilliant band !!!!!
B0002OERI0|1.0|I listened to this governmental/politically influenced cd via illegal downloading programs (thank god) because I was afraid that Green Day would disappoint me. Little did I know this album is amazing!! Oh wait never mind thats the opposite of how i felt.  Their sappy new single Wake Me Up When September Ends has simple lyrics and simple guitars to try to have 12 year old girls go nuts.  This cd belongs not on the top of everyone's cd collection, but in the bottom of everyone's trash can.  Green Day used to pump out good solid punk music that related to people, and this September song doesn't even make any sense!!  What is so bad about September?   <br /> <br />Theres just no feeling behind any of this.  It's like they are just trying to appease the record labels and make millions of dollars, which they did with ease, i'm sure. <br /> <br />Anyway, don't buy this cd unless you are a guy who wears eyeliner and/or girls pants.  You are the only type of person who deserves to listen to music like this.
B00082IJ08|5.0|I have never, EVER liked (or even listened to) hip-hop before, but after I heard \\"Feel Good Inc.\\" I decided I'd step out of my comfort zone and give something new a try.  <br /> <br />  I thought it would be a couple of good songs and then a bunch of filler songs on the album, but the whole thing (especially if you listen to it from beginning to end) is fabulous! The animation from the video (which is stunning and beautiful) sort of overshadows how good Gorillaz is as a band.  <br />  There's also a sort of dance beat going through the whole album, which leads up to \\"DARE\\" (an excellent song!) I like to think of this album as a sort of work of art that was carefully planned and executed . . . definitely a wonderful addition to anybody's music collection.  <br /> <br /> Make sure you listen to \\"Kid with Guns\\", \\"Last Living Souls\\", \\"Dirty Harry\\" (a truly amazing song) and last, but not least, \\"Feel Good Inc.\\" which carries a lovely message in the lyrics along with a good beat and bassline. You've got to love that 2-D!! <br /> <br /> My only complaint about the album is that it's a little more melancholy than what I generally like . . . good to listen to before you go to bed or on a rainy day! It fits right in with my Queen, Beatles, Slim Whitman, opera and classical CD's. All in all, a great album. And I'm much more open to rap music now!

B0000C8AVM|5.0|get this album. it is the best album ever recorded. it's pure magic. no kidding.    <br />   forget all the posing folk stuff young bob did as a kid. he was faking it to make it. when it came time for blood on the tracks bob was well over the whole \\"the world and what it thinks\\" thing and out came the real artist who happened to be there all along but had to wait till now to manifest. this album is a desert island album . infact i could only have ONE ALBUM this may well be it. i have never been so completely captivated by a single work of art in any medium. who is this guy? rasputin? its all phony crapola for sale in the world today but if you think you can handle the truth about what art is - if you can handle the pure magic of whoever this band is that accompanies him and makes the whole thing that was already the greatest thing ever infinity times better then go for BOTT. but believe me, having the scales fall from your eyes about the junk we are all about today is a high price to pay. is it worth it? i mean, is it worth becoming a bitter disillusioned curmudgeon in order to taste the best music album ever made? prolly not. if you don't buy this album you will live and even want to have children maybe.if you do get this album it's gonna leave a mark on you. you may lose the people you thought were your friends and end up all alone. it may still be worth it. and oh yeah, i'm not talking about lyrics that change the world here. i'm talking about the music- the sonics, that cut through bone like butter (\\"OHHHHH see what you can do\\" on youre a big girl now for instance). the drums just kill me. folks, you can't program drums like this (\\"they say i shot a man named gray -\\" TAT-TAT!). the music is all about touch tone inflection pure soul. not conscious effort and studio polish but pure universe filtered through a handful of musicians (open to the universe) whose sum is greater then the parts. This album isn';t just a materpiece. it's God's masterpiece. bad news foranyone who out there who thinks the best for this planet is yet to come. <br />   since discovering this album i have been looking for others. Blonde on Blonde is pretty good. Desire is a fairly close 2nd(Like Blood OTT and willy wonka's everylasting candies, black diamond bay never loses it's flavor. not even after a million auditions.) i also happen to own Infidels which is pretty good but on another level with knopfler and sly and robbie. but when i go back to say \\"freewheelin\\" i'm disappointed (except for \\"girl from the north country\\"). so, i don't have every record but i am telling you to skip the old school and that desire and blood on the tracks is pure sweet gold. blonde on blonde is decent. <br />  i also have self portrait (JUNK. bob says \\"[Forget] You\\" to the industry and the people who fell for his folk act.), Freewheelin (annoying cutesy folk except for the hint of good things to come on Girl Fromthe North country), blonde on blonde (getting there), Desire (A+++), infidels (good). <br />   what are you waiting for? discover what's really real. anybody else out there feel the same way? disagree? <br />
B0009I7NNA|4.0|Alright, first off, for everyone who gave this album one star, you're out of your minds. The guitars, bass ,and drums are all incredible and take it back to the days of Iron Maiden, Megadeth, and Slayer, so it definately doesn't deserve one star. Most of the one star reviewers were die hard AX7 fans from the start and they should be the first to know that M.Shadow had surgery to repair his vocal chords and he's now unable to scream at all. The fact that he can sing, even though its not the greatest, is a miracle. This CD doesn't sound like the previous Avenged Sevenfold CD's but it does remind me of Guns N' Roses and considering the current state of metal and music in general, that isn't a bad thing at all. Pick it up and listen to it a few times, it'll grow on you
B000AO4NJA|3.0|For more than two decades, the original 12-track release of 1962's THE BEST OF SAM COOKE (see my review) was the most complete collection of his hits. In 1986, it was replaced by the double-LP THE MAN AND HIS MUSIC (now out of print). In 2003, ABKCO released the definitive 30-track PORTRAIT OF A LEGEND (see my review).<br /><br />Now, two years later, RCA upgrades THE BEST OF by adding three bonus tracks:  \\"Win Your Love For Me\\" (No. 22, 1958), \\"You Were Made for Me\\" (No. 27, 1958) and \\"Nothing Can Change This Love\\" (No. 12, 1962).  Unfortunately, this collection still ends with 1962 which means it is still missing major hits like \\"Another Saturday Night,\\" \\"Shake\\" and the posthumously released classic \\"A Change Is Gonna Come.\\"<br /><br />The bottom line is this:  Sam Cooke is the most influential soul singer of the past half century, and any serious music collection must include at least one Sam Cook album.  But the album to get is PORTRAIT OF A LEGEND.  Why?  It includes all 15 tracks from THE BEST OF, plus 15 more (including the three mentioned above). The three-star rating isn't for the music (that's five-star!), it's for shortchanging such an influential artist.
0783231032|5.0|It is a great movie. It is old school comedy with great actors we love. It is a must see.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This album has got to be Em's best work.All the tracks are hot. But my favorites have got to be Stan,The Real Slim Shady, Kill You,The Way I Am and Marshall Mathers.Overall, it's a koooo album.
B00006690G|5.0|I think (In my opinion) that this is Eminems 2nd best album.I like all of the songs from begining to end. But my most favorite is Square Dance. Other songs I like alot are Without Me,White America,Sing for The Moment and Cleaning Out My Closet.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|The best part about this album is that it's nothing like Britney Spears.It has R&B beats, hip hop and dance. This album should have gotten a lot of credit because it's a hell of a lot better than Oops!...I Did It Again.The worst part of this album is her voice. I know she's NEVER going to sound like Christina, but atleast she could TRY! Britney is a talented singer even if she doesn't have \\"the voice\\". Well, neither does Jennifer Lopez Know how to sing properly but you don't see anyone hatin' on that bitch now do you.I give this album 4 stars because it could have been better if her voice REALLY matured.
B00004THDI|5.0|This is beautiful haunting music. One of the best all-time movie scores.
1402568851|4.0|I really liked this book on tape. I learned a lot about autisim in a compelling, entertaining, very intimate way. I have recommended it to many friends who have autistic children, and to those children as well. It's a strong clear voice for people maybe too shy or too walled off emotionally to be able to express or want to express their feelings for themselves.
B0002SROT0|5.0|This album is not for the faint of heart.  It is a descent into the night of the soul.  Every song betrays the artist's helpless longing to acheive meaning.  The songcraft is exquisite: almost every song would make an amazing cover.  Interspersed with the songs are impressionistic sound effects that highlight the dominant mood.  IMO, this is one of the signal albums of the last several years.  Listen to this album, and tremble... <br /> <br />
B0009Q0F5U|5.0|McCreary's Battlestar Galactic soundtrack is certainly one of the best I've hear in a long time.  The primal feel of McCreary's music, especially with his employment of Taiko drums, sets it apart from the usual space-opera soundtracks and is a breath of fresh air in the already stale John Williamsian dominated, purely orchestral, soundtracks.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Disney Animated Studios outdid themselves making this movie.  Once again truly another classic worth adding to your collection.  In my quest to \\"re-experience\\" everything from my younger years, I decided to watch every Disney movie I could get my hands on.  Beauty and the Beast truly stands the test of time along with the other animated classics that Disney has made.  A wonderful blend of hand-drawing and compuer animation made for one of the best animated pictures ever to be conceived from the folks at Disney. <br /> <br />The great thing about a movie like this is a depiction of a strong character.  In this case, Belle is quite a strong character indeed; specifically sacrificing her own life to save her father from the clutches of the Beast.  Disney does a good job of creating coming-of-age stories.  The evolution of the Beast is a good example of this.  Although the Beast looks the same throughout most of the movie, he truly evolves as a character thanks to the warm and loving nature of Belle's character.  Today's society can easily learn morals coming from this movie, specifically the fact that true beauty lies within. <br /> <br />Without a doubt the movie itself deserves 5 stars without question.  Memorable music is also what makes the movie as great as it is.  Alan Menken is a pure genious (sorry, I can't remember the other music geniouses who contributed to the making of Beauty and the Beasts' musical score). <br /> <br />Overall this is an excellent movie that's worth putting in anybody's collection.  The special features are a great bonus and you will gain much info on the creation of this great movie.
B0009UC7H0|3.0|I don't get the comparisons with James Bond or Indiana Jones. Yeah, the filmmakers play James Bond type music during the boat chase sequence, trying to establish that connection; and, yeah, the hero, Dirk Pitt, is adventuresome and scruffy like Indiana Jones. But to me, the strongest comparison is with the Michael Douglas character in Romancing the Stone. As a matter of fact, I can't think of an actor that Matthew McConaughey resembles more than Michael Douglas.<br /><br />I hate the comparisons with the novel. On the one hand, if you're going to base a film on a well-known book, make it as close as possible to the original while still maintaining your own vision. But then, on the other hand, why did the author, Clive Cussler, feel it was necessary for McConaughey to look so much like his character, Dirk Pitt, that he made him dye his hair? Wouldn't it have made more sense if the script and McConaughey's acting had resembled the character? But then, nothing about the background of this film makes any sense, even though much of it is covered in the extra features.<br /><br />The one thing that does make sense is Matthew McConaughey's motivation for making this film: to be like Dirk Pitt - i.e., to save the day and get the girl. Now, that's not exactly a brainy, innovative motivation; but then, neither is McConaughey or this film. We've seen it all before: good-natured, typically selfish, treasure hunting male; beautiful, compassionate, socially minded female; handy, faithful, wisecracking sidekick; power-crazed, ruthless villain bent on ruling the world. It would have been nice if they had given this well-worn formula a new spin.<br /><br />One of the more interesting aspects of Sahara is the art direction. Visually the film is stunning, especially the locations. The opening sequence in which we take a tour of Dirk's workroom while the credits roll is both interesting and informative.<br /><br />And the dialogue is often entertaining for some light and witty bantering. But then we go off on a plot that is thin and getting thinner; until finally, by the end of the film, everything hinges on keeping a stockpile of disease-causing waste out of an African river that flows into the Atlantic Ocean, thus preventing the entire world from becoming infected and dying. Please.<br /><br />The biggest disappointment for me is that, by the end of the film, no one has changed. That is the earmark of a good story: the hero goes through something that causes him to change, hopefully for the better - but not Dirk Pitt. Even though he faces superhuman challenges that would break a lesser man, none of them seem to affect him. He's the same person at the end of the movie that he was at the beginning. Oh, he saves the day and gets the girl, but...shouldn't there be more? Based on the $69 million return on the $130 million invested, I'd say most movie goers believe there should.<br /><br />Waitsel Smithy bantering.

B000AL730O|4.0|Admittedly, I'm not a huge fan of all of Paul's solo work.  But I love the 'stripped down' sound of this one.  I think the producer was a huge influence.  I loved what Nigel did with Jason Falkner's album 'Can You Still Feel?' in which Jason played all of his instruments as well.  I'd love to see Paul do an acoustic tour and join up with similar artists like Glenn Tilbrook and Neil Finn.  I think with this album \\"Less is More\\" and hopefully, it's a sign of Paul simplifying his music a bit in the future.  I'll give this one a Macca inspired thumbs aloft!
0714845183|4.0|but on the pre-Raphaelites as a group, too.<br /><br />Waterhouse's subject are almost always willowy, languid models from mythological themes. He often chooses scenes and poses that emphasize the youthful woman's partial deshabille - others in this school, especially Alma-Tadema, found more ways to lose more of the clothing, though. Waterhouse was active during the late Victorian period up through the early twentieth century, and was one of a large group of painters, including Millais, Rosetti, Burne-Jones, and numerous others. Those artists supplied the seemingly insatiable market of gentlemen buying the trappings of 'culture' and 'success.' Under the name of Art, these Victorian gentleman would surround themselves with the very finest unclad forms - it was a lucrative market, and respected in its time.<br /><br />Whatever one may think of the topics or buyers, there is no disputing Waterhouse's technical mastery. His figures are generally elegant, and elegantly draped (or un-draped). Still, he found reason to render more realistic 'peasant' figures, too. His romantic topics are easy to enjoy, although they do cloy after a while. This is very fine presentation of his art, with an informative biographywoven in.<br /><br />My only criticisms of the book come from its weak focus on Waterhouse's art. Trippi offers many samples from Waterhouse's contemporaries, far more than I think necessary for creating context and contrast. The text, though helpful, often took up space I would rather have seen devoted to larger reproductions. Still, this presentation is a good one, and has a place in any collection western painting.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B000AMPZGC|4.0|Recently seeing the movie, I can tell that Danny Elfman may have been a bet pressed to put out this soundtrack, but even though the music isn't quite as catchy as some of his past efforts, it doesn't delude from the fact that the soundtrack is still good, very good.  <br /> <br />The songs that seemed most strange and out of place in the movie are the \\"zany\\" songs. Although the songs are still good, the sheer weirdness of it throws off the flow of the story a bit, until it gets to the end, where the zany music complaments the story supurbly.  <br /> <br />The songs that REALLY shine are the slower, more dramatic songs. For instance, Victors Piano Solo, is a soft, eerie and yet surprisingly calming Beethoven-esque piano suite which is simply ravishing. It sweeps like Beethovens Moon-light Sonata and then turns into it's own creation. This song is one of my favorites. <br /> <br />The other piano theme, The Piano Duet is a simple yet equally beautiful piece which helps bring out the 2 charectors of Victor and the Corpse Bride. The theme begins as very melancholy and then evolves into a lively, more romantic piece and finally ends on a Jazzy note.  <br /> <br />The soundtrack was defintily wonderful and the every piece was intresting, even though some of the songs were a little mis-placed.  <br /> <br />Songs like \\"Tears to Shed\\" had an uplifting feel to them, but then quieted down and became sad as the Corpse Bride told how she was still heart-broken. The music tied everything together and without it, you might never have sympathized with the poor Undead girl. The music truly brought the story together and explained everything with a certain light that only Burton and Elfman are capable of. <br /> <br />The soundtrack is a definite hit for fans of Elfman and Burtons work and is sure to be a memorable peice in anyones collection.
0142001104|5.0|I've read many books in the self-help/psychology genre.  This has the most practical advice that I've ever read.  It shows how a shift in looking at the context of the events in our lives, can open up possibilities for transforming ourselves and all the communities in which we have relationships.  The credits in the book reference Landmark Education.  Having participated in that education, I am happy to have a book which I can refer to as life unfolds in its various ways.
0780626494|5.0|What a fun movie!  Lots of good music - good humor - plausible story line (especially if you lived during the 50's and 60's)!  It is a wonderful reminder of how simple life once was!
B000002IG4|4.0|First, to Editorial Reviewer Dan Durchholz - nice work, but one big boo-boo:  Phil had not divorced Jill at the time of this album - he had just married her, and remained married to her for many years. He cited her in the notes of this album because he loved her. The bitter songs referred to his ex (Andrea), who reportedly cheated on him with her interior decorator, spawning several songs from Genesis' Duke album (e.g. Misunderstanding, Please Don't Ask) and much of Face value and this album.<br /><br />This is a fine album with some great grooves, some bitter diatribes, some manic-happy-pop and heartbreaking ballads. Phil hits his best R&B a la Collins feel in this record, for my money. I Cannot Believe It's True is a gem. Great, great drums all around. But why \\"Like China\\" even made it out of a disturbed sleep, much less into the studio, I can't fathom.<br /><br />More hits than misses - for the detractors, Phil does what he sets out to do with a higher batting average than most.  Prog-rockers beware - unless you like lighter fare as well.
B00008WT5E|4.0|Disclaimer/Qualifier: As far as AC/DC goes, i am firmly in the \\"Bon Scott\\" camp; Brian Johnson' voice may have been amazing on the first few albums he did with the band, but overall I prefer Bon's sound and lyrics.  I also think that Angus and Malcolm came up with more consistently solid riffs back in the '70's.<br /><br />\\"Powerage\\" probably gets passed over by most CD-buyers, because it doesn't have a single song that gets radio play (such as \\"Dirty Deeds\\" or \\"T.N.T.\\" or \\"Highway to Hell\\" or even \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\").  But this is definitely one of my favorite AC/DC albums and the fact that \\"Powerage\\" doesn't have any familiar radio hits makes it in many ways a more exciting listen.<br /><br />What you get is a collection of great riffs that maintains intensity and interest almost from start to finish.  \\"Rock and Roll Damnation\\" is very catchy, and unusual in that it has no guitar solo - proof that there was more to this band than just Angus' insanity!  \\"Down Payment Blues\\" and \\"Gone Shootin'\\" showcase the band's slower, darker side, while \\"Riff Raff\\" takes its cue from Led Zeppelin's \\"Rock And Roll\\" - but this riff is way cooler than the Led Zep track.<br /><br />The most famous song off this album is probably \\"Sin City\\" and with good reason - it'll always be one of the great odes to Las Vegas (or any other gambling town), and it features an instantly catchy chord progression with a backbeat that calls to mind \\"Hell Ain't No Bad Place To Be.\\"<br /><br />If not for the last two songs, which kind of tread water and bring the album to a lukewarm conclusion, this CD would rate five stars.  As it is, I still recommend it to anyone who likes straight ahead rock music.<br /><br />The remaster does a wonderful job of restoring the power to these recordings; I bought the first issue of this CD back in the 90's and it just sucked - the sound was thin and poorly mixed.  The new reissues are a million times better sounding.
1400095913|3.0|Trying to mix comedy with horror is a difficult task. Lindsay gives it a good try, but fails to pull it off. I didn't laugh and I didn't cringe. <br /> <br />If one has nothing else to read, as sometimes happens to me, this book beats watching \\"Survivor\\", Donald Trump or Martha Stewart. To tell the truth, I thought \\"Sex in the City\\" was simply repetious, so one can tell where I am coming from.
0375759174|5.0|This was the first Jane Austen book I read, when I was a teenager, and it didn't impress me then--maybe because it starts off rather boringly, as she spends a whole chapter and more telling us how mediocre and ordinary her heroine is. Now that I've read more romantic-adventure novels--and seen the same kind of movies--Austen's warnings that Catherine isn't a beautiful orphan who is likely to get into life-threatening situations are a bit easier to take. The parallel romances of Catherine and her flirtatious friend Isabella are delights to follow, and I can't help but wonder why no film has been made of this Austen novel (though I believe there was a British TV miniseries). In short, not the best of the Austen romances, but a charmer that the author herself keeps warning us not to take too seriously.
B000A6T1KE|3.0|never mind the pun.  He explained adequetly why he did what he did.  They hired 'em, that's what you get.  However by an audience stand point, nearly EVERY regular cast character acted OUT of character COMPLETELY.  It wasn't your 1980's style go-softly-yet-valently hero it was like a 21st C '02 b*** fest.  Picard was totaly out of element(I liked the driving that wasn't it at all, he needs some action)  Data's infamous heroism wasn't that bad, but it wasn't good either.  The other thing was just stupid.  It was like they were replacing Data with, well, another Data.  A moron version.  Which seemed to be the theme of the whole crew.  An IQ drop of 7 points and then some more later on.  The marrage scene(yeah that is pretty STNG BUT) was stupid and could have been done more in character.  The atmospere was not STNG in the ship at all.  The exterior scenes were very good and refreshing(more STNG should've taken place outside I think in the show and past movies).  what was wrong wasn't the actiion scenes as in a post nuclear holicost moive, it was what was MISSING.  The INTELLIGENCE behind those scenes.  A staple in Gene Rodenberry Star Trek.  The young picard wasn't half bad, the Remons and Romulans were.  Remons(counter parts) are just stupid brutes with no intimidation or ferocity at all.  Disappointing.  Not scary.  It is not the worst film in the bunch.  ST V was by far the worst attempt(not because of lack of SFX)  I was slightly annoyed by \\"Generations\\" as well as it should've just been named \\"The Two Captains\\" as in Doctor Who's \\"The Two Doctors\\" as that is what it implied.  You can't sue an american if yer a brit. ;)  I think this is a fun watch more for the action hero type than the Star Trek fan, but fun.  Watch!  Three Obsidian coins!  That's all I'm bet'n on this!
0156027321|4.0|Overall, Yann Martel has woven together a wonderful tale, with an intriguing central character, a great plot, and the added color of topics like religion and zookeeping. His storytelling ebbed and flowed well for the most part, though its rhythm followed like that of the oceans - placidly at times, crashing fiercely at others. The story kept me enthralled, even though early on, the ending is clear. There were also a few moments that required a strong stomach. But the magic of the book is that you really do what to know how he survives and in the end, it challenges your beliefs and tests your perspective. A book that thought-provoking is clearly a winner.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|I must confess that in the 1960's, (and no more than 30 minutes from NYC living in Tenafly, NJ across the Hudson River), I missed Bob Dylan entirely! Right, not one album. I was raised wearing white blouses, kilt skirts, knee socks, circle pins and cheerleading my way to nowhere while steeped in classical music including madrigals, choir, and orchestra. But I purchased - No Direction Home - almost on a whim, or maybe it was a prayer, in a most serious effort to understand how I ended up in-the-age-they-call middle. To my utter astonishment, however, I found myself soaring-singing again above all the muck-n-mire within this sublime documentary of language (music itself) as part of Dylan's life, loves, hopes, dreams, genius, despair, and joy while distilling the very essence of that oh-so-mysterious light within ALL of us: but so gloriously embodied in one...named Bob Dylan (a man - a real man - representing all our colors). If this documentary-CD set had been 10 times the price, it would be worth still more. I assure you, whether you are new to Bob Dylan (as I idiotically am); or one who has been there all along, I would beg you (and I don't beg) to buy this sublime work of art. It could change our world somehow stuck, and seemingly spinning askew. God Bless you always, Bob!
B000002GW5|3.0|The album is as good as it has ever been with the same Jackson Browne sound that has made him famous.  If the original multi-track tape is still avilable a new digital remix would most certainly be an improvement to sonic quality.
B000000WJK|5.0|I personally believe that this is one of the most original and vivid pieces of music available.  The emotion and texture that is put forth is rare in popular music.  The critics, yes there are always critics, should consider themselves for a second before judging a band who were one of the greatest rock and roll bands of their time.  For those of you who have not heard this cd, and are here because of Bittersweet Symphony, I would be prepared for an awakening.  This is the trip to heaven that Urban Hymns was coming down from.
B000001GQC|3.0|The Soviet Union was a decade away from collapsing when the young Abbado made a splash with this Alexander Nevsky from London. It took a long time before the British left gave up its ties with the Soviet Union as the leader of international socialism, but this is a decidedly non-Russian performance. The quieter passages are refined and reverential (didn't the Soviets get rid of churches?), and the chorus sings Russian by the syllable.<br /><br />Abbado injects plenty of big brass and strikes the proper barbaric tone for the invading Teutonic knights, but one listen to post-Soviet versions from Temirkanov (the complete film score, on RCA/BMG) and Gergiev (Decca) more or less renders the Abbado recording moot -- and the famous Reiner version with it, since that account is sung in English. DG's analogue sound strikes me as a bit shrill, but the LSO plays vigorously -- as they almost always did for Abbado when he was chief conductor.<br /><br />For all its superficial drama, this reading needs an extra infusion of borscht and tears. If the Kirov Orch. played Elgar, I think Londoners could tell the difference.
0451191153|5.0|Ayn Rand's amazing ability to understand the world of architecture and the struggle of an architects mind is amazing; especially since she is not herself an architect. She spent years researching the life of an architect and I must say she hit it right on the mark.  The characters in the book come to life and become people you know in your own lives.  This isn't just for the Architects and future architects but is especially for them! Dont judge this book by the cover I'm glad I put my judgement aside and read the book which was recommended by a PhD friend.  It really is one of those books you cant put down!
B00005LW7R|2.0|I expected greatness given the lead singer and conductor. But Terfel blusters and overacts, showing too much fussiness in his phrasing and not enough simple Italian brio. (I didn't believe this Falstaff when he says, at the end, that he is humorous in himself and the cause of humor in others.) Terfel has lots of color in his voice, more than anyone since Taddei and Gobbi, but there's also an alarming wobble at times to mar the pitch. Nobody else in the cast does anything special, and Abbado reverts to his unsmiling, proficient style in Verdi. For a set that clearly was supposed to be a classic, this is more or less a dud unless you simply accept what each singer has to offer on its own terms.<br /><br />Fortunately, as of Nov. 2007, the Metropolitan Opera has made a deal to provide online versions of many broadcasts, and one from April 6, 2002 features a Falstaff with Terfel in muh better form, with James Levine giving one of the funniest, most lively accounts of the score that I have ever heard. The rest of the cast is also satisfying, more comic and in better voice than DG's cast (few of the suporting singers on either set are stars). Only the sonics fall short of Abbado's set, although they are good enough. The online source is Real Rhapsody.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Requiem for a Dream contains a vast world outside drug use. <br /> <br />The movie starts out with Harry (played by Jared Leto) locking his mother, Sara Goldfarb (played by Ellen Burstyn) in the closet. He pawns the television, and as we find out, he has pawned it many times as shown in Mr. Rabinowitz's checkbook, which if you look closely, is titled \\"Sara Goldfarb's TV.\\" The reason for pawning the set is so Harry, and his friend Tyrone C. Love, (Marlon Wayans) can purchase a hit of heroine. <br /> <br />Harry also has a girlfriend, Marion (Jennifer Connolly.) The three friends launch a scheme to buy a pound of pure, uncut heroine. While this is happening, Sara Goldfarb recieves a phone-call where she is told she will be on her favorite game show, even though it is most likely merely a deceptive advertising scheme. Being elderly and naive, Sara Goldfarb is excited by this offer, and becomes addicted to diet pills to lose weight. The three friends, slowly become addicted to their own drugs, and are unable to become big time dealers with a pound of pure. <br /> <br />We see the characters crash and burn, but with the vivid characterizations, it bothers and challenges the viewer, rather than makes the viewer feel superior to what would be mere \\"junkies.\\" We see that these four people are human beings, led askew by their addictions. But the film would be mediocre if it were merely about drug addiction. <br /> <br />Instead the drugs are a powerful symbol of suffering. On the DVD's extra features, Hubert Selby Jr. is interviewed by Ellen Burstyn. Hubert Selby Jr. is the author of the novel, which this movie was based on. He explains that suffering occurs when pain is avoided, and when we venture into escapism, the suffering grows stronger. <br /> <br />This is not the only superior aspect of the film. The camera techniques make use of Selby's idea of the resistance to suffering. There is a brief, surreal escape when the characters use drugs. It shows a close-up of the needle, the spoon heating, the blood flow, and the pupils dilating. Then soon after we are jolted back into reality, to show the temporary high, and the inescapable agony of real life. But the characters do not want to face this reality. They pursue their \\"dreams\\" until it ruins them. Avoidance of suffering causes more pain. Illegal drugs are among the most obvious forms of escapism, and it works beautifully and terrifyingly in this movie. <br />
B000002RXS|5.0|That was the advertizing slogan EMI used for this performance, and it's still true. Everything that could go technically wrong with her voice had already happened: she's wobbly on top, squawky at times, and leathery in her hcest notes. But her passion makes up for eveyr deficit. If you can stand the voice at that stage, the rewards are immense.<br /><br />The next best thing is that this production feels very French, not blandly international. Even the scrappy conducting under Pretre, the only man Callas would accept on the podium, feels right because it is so back street.<br /><br />But really it's all Callas's show. Nicolai Gedda strikes no sparks as Don Jose, and he's the best of the lot. This Carmen rises or falls depending  on how you react to the lead singer, and my reaction is awe.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|I was out on the deck cooking a steak and listening to Bob Dylan playing down in Bayfront Park when between songs he pointed out to the crowd that he had been born here in the Zenith City in a hospital on the side of the hill.  This was the second time that Dylan had played Duluth, and the fact that he acknowledged this is the city of his birth was seen as icing on the cake because most of us were surprised he would ever come back here to play.  That is because the man born Robert Zimmerman has been running from northern Minnesota pretty much since the day he graduated from Hibbing High School.<br /><br />The title of \\"No Direction Home: Bob Dylan\\" emphasizes that the singer-songwriter was a construct and attempts to chronicle the transformation from Robert Zimmerman to Bob Dylan.  The key influence has always been considered to be Woody Guthrie, and Dylan's visit to Guthrie in the hospital is an iconic Sixties vision quest, but this documentary is able to work in many more names into the mix.  The connections to the music at any time during the early stages of Dylan's career are only addressed tangentially, but that only underscores that this is not a music appreciation course on Bob Dylan, as much as that would be nice.  This is an attempt to preserve the extant record on the first quarter century of Dylan's life, with an emphasize on the five years at the end of that period that represent the most creative and significant portion of his career, aided and abetted by talking heads the likes of Joan Baez, Allen Ginsberg, Liam Clancy, and Al Kooper, who provide memories and retrospective insights (Kooper's story on how he ended up playing the organ on \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" is a testament to serendipity in the music business).<br /><br />Since Martin Scorsese was basically given 10 hours of film footage to shape into a four-hour documentary, the sense in which he served as \\"director\\" of \\"No Direction Home\\" would be in laying out the basic structure for film editor David Tedeschi.  Obviously the main thrust of the documentary is the chronology of Dylan's life, which mixes archival footage with contemporary interviews.  But this narrative plays out against Dylan's 1966 tour of Great Britain, already the focus of D.A. Pennebaker's documentary \\"Don't Look Back,\\" during which he offended a large segment of his fans by picking up an electric guitar.  Night after night Dylan would play an acoustic set to raves from his audience, and then return with a backing band for an electric set.  Time and time again you hear audience members scream \\"Judas\\" and other insults, while Dylan tells the bad to just play louder.  The main narrative and the subtext come together when Dylan shows up at the Newport Folk Festival supported by the Paul Butterfield Blues Band and shocks the world.  The U.K. tour kept the wound open and it was the motorcycle accident in the summer of 1966 that turned Dylan into a recluse that adds the exclamation point on the<br /><br />One of the things that resulted from that decision was the song that \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine picked as the top rock song of all-time, \\"Like a Rolling Stone,\\" which also happened to be the first single Dylan ever released (it went to #2 on the Billboard charts).  This was taken as clear evidence that Dylan was going \\"commercial,\\" yet even the fans who booed and shouted curses when Dylan came on stage with the Band (nee the Hawks), applauded that one song.  The problem was not that Dylan was becoming commercial (\\"Eve of Destruction\\" was a #1 song and that did not hurt Barry McGuire's bona fides as a folk rebel), but that for the most part he appeared to be giving up being the voice of his generation.  In that regard the biggest slap in the face to those who worshipped him was not \\"Like a Rolling Stone,\\" with its powerful onslaught of pointed lyrics, but \\"Mr. Tambourine Man,\\" which we see him performing at a folk song workshop, because that is not a song that is going to send young people to thestreets let alone to the barricades.<br /><br />The interviews done with Dylan are actually the least important part of \\"No Direction Home,\\" because if there is anything we have learned from listening to Dylan over the past four decades it is to let the music speak for itself.  In all of the footage from the first half of the Sixties showing Dylan talking with reporters he repeatedly dodges their questions.  They want to know what the songs are about and he refuses to tell them.  It might seem like he is waiting for somebody smart enough to pose a question worth answering, but I have to believe he would never play that game.  This is a man who insisted he grew up in Gallup, New Mexico rather than admit to being from Hibbing, and his willingness to sit in front of a film camera and talk about his past does not automatically mean increased veracity.  I would like to believe that when Dylan talks about the musicians he listened to growing up that he is telling the truth, but I always wary.<br /><br />What is potentially the most illuminating thing that Dylan says about himself in this four-hour documentary is his insistence that he was never a topical songwriter.  If you can wrap your mind about the truth in that obvious lie, which is possible if you keep in mind Dylan's contemporaries on the folk scene in the early Sixties and remember that sometimes words have two meanings, then you can arrive at a better understanding of the truth inherent in Dylan's music.  \\"No Direction Home\\" does not fully illuminate Bob Dylan, but that impossibility is hardly Scorsese's agenda.  Ultimately, Scorsese is making the case for why Dylan should end up getting a Noble Prize for Literature some day soon.  The only better way to make the case is to simply listen to the man's music.o the barricades.

B0002F6AH0|5.0|I have little to add, this documentary is riveting from beginning to end.  The art of the documentary is lost these days, but this gem shines in all respects...its narration, its <br />story telling, its footage, its score...simply the best of the genre whether you are interested in the topic or not...a must see.
B000AP04OM|5.0|Great movie and great singing and acting by Ms Andrews. If it would not have had Julie it would have flopped, I am more then certain. It is a movie that after you see it you are cheerful for hours. I already have an older copy. But I am buying this 40th anniversary copy for all the extras. Love to hear commentaries by such a fine actress as Ms Andrews and of course Mr Wise. Glad to have him on as his last bit of comments on such a great movie. <br />When I hear Ms Andrews sing I feel terrible that her voice is not with us anymore. But she is still with us and hopefully she will continue to be given movie parts. The Sound of Music is one of her best performances in a musical and Duet for One is the best of her performances in a serious Drama. <br />No family should be without the Sound of Music. It is great !!
B000AU9UYM|5.0|What makes a hero movie is faithfulness. Is it faithful to the character?  Is it faithful to his/her motivations?  Pathos?  And in a case such as Begins, is it faithful to the history and character boundaries set by the creator?   <br /> <br />Only a few minutes into Begins, and we're already deeper into backstory than all of the previous \\"Bat\\" films combined.  It only gets better.  It's more than the when's of Bruce Wayne/Batman.  It's the what's, why's, who's, where's, and how's.   <br /> <br />What happened to him?  Why choose to leave Gotham?  Who influenced him?  Where did he travel to?  Who did he meet?  What did he learn?  Why does he choose that life?  Why does he return to Gotham?  How does he become Batman? <br /> <br />With a deep root in Long Halloween, a nod to Frank's Year One, and zealous direction that chooses realism over cartoon--this is it.  For longtime fans of the character of Batman, this is the film that most gets it.  In a word, worthy.
B000A6T1HC|5.0|I write this review in Italian because I think there is no need to defend Cecilia Bartoli in the English-speaking world. But in Italy she's constantly on trial.  <br /> <br />1) La copertina secondo me non  male. La trovo un'autocosciente e ironica concessione al kitsch per un album che non ha proprio un programma da Bocelli! Dopo tutto  una grande diva, ma non fa proprio dei dischi nazional-popolari. In qualche modo la Decca deve pur compensare!  <br />2) Bellissimo programma per l'appunto e per niente scontato, come al solito, tra cui molte cose inedite e mai registrate prima <br />3) Per chi avesse quest'idea, il suo non  un vibrato caprino. E' una cosa strana che fa solo nei brani concitati per esprimere concitazione (e che faceva anche nei dischi precedenti, da quello di Vivaldi in poi e che NON fa in Mozart o Rossini neanche adesso. L'ho sentita dal vivo, ve l'assicuro!). Una cosa che comunque anche a me sembra un po' artificiosa. Nei brani lenti non c' niente di simile. <br />4) Minkowski e i Musiciens du Louvre sono splendidi. <br />5) Non c' bisogno di dirlo, visto che si tratta di un disco, ma i melomani sono un po' fissati: SI', LA VOCE DELLA BARTOLI IN TEATRO SI SENTE. <br />  <br />Che cosa si deve pretendere di pi? Cecilia Bartoli si innalza sempre di una spanna dalla routine degli esecutori di oggi e dovrebbe essere di esempio a tutti per la chiarezza, l'incisivit, la precisione, la comunicativit e, perch no?, il coraggio delle sue interpretazioni. Tutto sommato se lo merita tutto il suo timbro di \\"opera proibita\\", visto che viene sempre messa sotto processo.
