B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I found Downton Abbey in a Roku search for classic British drama and/or PBS series. Because I don't receive an standard network or cable TV, I had no idea it was a current series. Very reminiscent of the classic &#34;Upstairs, Downstairs&#34; series, I fell in love immediately and was disappointed when the available episodes were at an end. Am watching each new episode as it comes available on Roku and am still delighted with the series. I think I was born in the wrong country and the wrong era. LOL
0670022411|5.0|I entered into this book not knowing that it was to be the first part of a trilogy, and as the end grew closer, I kept thinking, how is she going to wrap this all up? I think I found Ms Harkness' website and realized it was to be a trilogy some scant few chapters before the end, which was both a relief, but also extremely frustrating at the time.<br />This wonderful new look at a world of witches, vampires and daemons among us is written with a perfect blend of tension, excitement and erotic enticement. I think Ms Harkness' vampires manage to outdo those of Anne Rice when it comes to romantic sexiness, although Lestat will probably hunt me down for saying so. ;-) (I still remain a stalwart fan of Ms Rice.)<br />The characters are so well developed, so engaging, that you want too go back and re-read the book, for details you might have missed each time.<br />I cannot wait for the trilogy to be complete.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I knew I'd get really involved with the series, which was why I had been avoiding starting it. Now that I've started, I can't stop! Already on the third book....
B001NXDIMK|5.0|I am totally addicted to this series.  The acting is superb... I use it to watch during my workout, and every day I can't wait to watch it.
B008US25E8|4.0|record has just arrived in perfect conditions.<br />i love music of aerosmith..this album is great and is full of beautiful songs.<br />many thanks...luke.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Who wouldn't love cowboys in space?  At least pressure from fans caused the producers to make the &#34;Serenity&#34; movie to kind of wrap it up a little bit.
0316228532|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered this book, except that I knew that Rowling was a good writer.<br />The book is a clear departure from the HP series, but we are still in a world that troubles both adults and young people, although this time, the causes are related to real socio-economic issues that are no doubt common in England (and here in North America), as opposed to magic.<br />The characters are well-developed, fully realized, and plentiful, giving the reader a lot to consider. There are only a few people, though, in the broad cast, that seem truly sympathetic, and I think that's undoubtedly as it should be.<br />The ending came as a surprise to me, which is all I will say about it.<br />It was a bleak book, but deservedly so, and well written nonetheless. I won't re-read it as often as I will HP, but I will still come back to it.
B003EI2EH2|1.0|A lot of selling weird &#34;food supplements&#34;. Regret that I paid for this. Just stick to his other book four hour work week
B000FC1HBY|5.0|The characters are truly sophisticated and even the ones who are supposed protagonists have substantial flaws. The violence is more than a little gruesome but otherwise the novel is very engrossing. Now onto book three.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|After seeing commercials for this movie on Disney Jr, I decided to buy this movie for my three year old. I happy I did buy it.  She has watched this movie just about everyday since I purchased it.  It's a very cute movie.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Good performances and a good plot line. Not much else to say, but good for an interesting movie night at home.
1439152802|5.0|Having read all of Kate Morton's books so far,  It seems to me that they keep getting better with each one.  So if haven't read any Kate Morton, give this one a try and if you like it, go back and read the others!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Just not a satisfying ending to the trilogy.  The first two books were full of twists and turns, but the last one was just predictable and boring.  I finished it only because I was waiting for more than just the main character falling to pieces.  Katniss was a great symbol for the first two books and just pathetic in the last.  The “Girl on Fire” fizzled out .
3940004502|2.0|Not what I have come to expect from Rea based on his last 10 yrs work . For the price I would for sure pass.  I've spld mine @ the local used record store.
B008602KQI|4.0|I thought this was interesting though I usually don't go in for movies that seem like they're going to appeal to masses of teens.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|What a great gaming experience! This is an awesome game at no cost!! I would definitely reccomend this app! :)
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|A great movie with an evident heart! The topics conveyed in this movie are potentially controversial depending on the audience (love and sexual relations of individuals with disabilities,) but a very thought-provoking and endearing movie. Very brave and heartfelt performances by all!
B000002G8L|5.0|This is really a good sounding disc. Excellent performance by Eric and his band. Disc # 2 is especially good.
B002VQ7PVS|4.0|This book was a delightful journey ... I enjoyed it immensely. I rated it 4 stars as I felt that the book ended without final resolution to some questions. But the overall story was a terrific read. I will read more of this author's books.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Easy to download and to use. I have this on my Google Nexus 7 and couldn't get along without it.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|I enjoyed this movie -- most especially the dramatic flying scenes.  I also like Denzel Washington. Altogether it was interesting. However I did not like the explicit drug usage in the movie. It was far too graphic and unnecessary in my opinion. It is therefore completely inappropriate for young people, whom we don't want watching how to ingest illegal drugs.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I loved the old characters but finally Tom Clancy has me caring about the new group also.  I look forward to future books with these characters.  The story is very timely and just yesterday (2/7/13) network news covered a story that was very familiar to the main plot.  So many of Mr. Clancy's stories seem like words of caution, he is very much in touch with our world as a whole and it just makes the book that much easier to get into.  I hope I don't need to wait another two years or more for the next chapter.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|I didn't know what to expect form this book, bit It's simply amazing! Besides I think this book can help everyone to improve their lifes, sometimes we need to stop and realize what really matters and what doesn't.
B007KDFWRG|5.0|This an extremely good sounding disc of an excellent band. The music is really good. This is a very enjoyable CD set.
B005LAIIJY|4.0|\\"My name is Django. The D is silent.\\"<br /><br />King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) slowly rides his dentist's wagon toward two slave traders and their recent purchases, a line of black men all bound together with shackles, bare-chested in the cold Texas night. The outwardly affable Schultz is looking for a particular slave purchased at a specific plantation. The two slave traders aren't very receptive to their visitor, but Schultz is convinced the slave is in their possession. After some `negotiation', Schultz soon meets Django (Jamie Foxx). Schultz is a bounty hunter desperate to find the Brittle brothers, three sadistic plantation workers with a price on their head. Schultz doesn't know what they look like and Django does. They make an agreement; if Django helps Schultz, the bounty hunter will help his new friend find his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), who has been purchased by another ruthless plantation owner, Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). But there are many obstacles, including an old slave (Samuel L. Jackson) who is very devoted to Candie.<br /><br />So begins \\"Django Unchained\\", the new film from writer/director Quentin Tarantino. And from the moment the film begins, there is no mistaking this film as anything but a Tarantino film. Over the top dialogue and violence, amusing character interactions, a mish-mash of filmmaking genres and actors at the top of their game are all in evidence in the masterful director's newest film.<br /><br />Tarantino's well-publicized beginnings - working at a video store and devouring every film there - have inspired and/or shaped every film he has made. Some of these films include Blaxploitation titles about slaves who fight back against their oppressive masters and these provide the inspiration for \\"Django\\".<br /><br />Some of these films were made by filmmakers with small budgets and less talent. Others were made on the cheap to capitalize on a specific audience. Some of these films are remembered today because of the actors involved. Some; because of the outrageous, over-the-top action. But most of these are, let's face it, terrible films.<br /><br />The beauty of Tarantino's films is that he takes inspiration from these bad films and filters it through his far superior filmmaking skills and larger budgets. He's giving Five Star treatment to B or C grade material. When he does this, he elevates it while still retaining the feel and style of the originals, creating films that are unique and extremely watchable.<br /><br />From the moment the film begins, you recognize all of the familiar hallmarks of Tarantino's style. Schultz often uses verbal dexterity to momentarily confuse the people he is dealing with, giving him the upper hand. Tarantino is a skilled writer and his dialogue is usually great, revealing unique and interesting things about his characters. If anything, the writer occasionally suffers from a lack of editing and his dialogue goes on for too long and for no other reason than to show how great his writing is. On the flip side, he also frequently features characters who are largely silent, but still manage to get their ideas across. Uma Thurman's The Bride is a great example of this. Hell-bent on revenge, she has heard everything before making her much more interested in results. Django is very similar. Extremely quiet and introspective, he spends a lot of time standing by, watching, as Schultz talks his way into and out of various situations. Most of the characters in \\"Django\\" can be traced back through Tarantino's other films. And even though we have seen the ancestors of these characters before, the director does a great job of making these characters exciting and memorable.<br /><br />One of the hallmarks of Tarantino's previous works is less evident here. In the past, Tarantino has cast some of the actors who made his inspirational films so memorable as the leads in his films, giving them a significant showcase to reinvigorate their careers. John Travolta, PamGrier, Robert Forster, David Carradine, to name a few, got jumpstarts from their appearances in Tarantino's works. Lately, as the budgets of his films continue to increase, and his films become more important to the production company, he has been leaning more heavily on A-List talent. Look at \\"Jackie Brown\\" -  Pam Grier and Robert Forster are the stars; Robert DeNiro, Bridget Fonda and Samuel L. Jackson are the co-stars. In \\"Django\\", the balance has shifted. Some interesting actors pop-up in small roles - Don Johnson, Russ Tamblyn, and M.C. Gainey - but these moments don't have the impact of someone like Grier starring in a film. The thrill of rediscovering a good actor is one aspect of what makes some of Tarantino's films so great.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx is very good. From the moment he introduces himself - \\"The D is silent\\" - you get what he and Tarantino are trying to do. Foxx is playing The Black Man with No Name, based on a character made famous by Clint Eastwood in his early westerns. This is a grittier, bloodier, Tarantino-ized version of the character, but the inspiration is clear. Even when Django is standing still, observing, a subtle facial expression or change in body language helps build his character and illustrate the feelings he has difficulty expressing.<br /><br />Christoph Waltz is very good as King Schultz, the bounty hunter who decides traveling with a black man, in the South, before the Civil War, is the best and easiest way to track his prey. Perhaps the best thing about his character is that he doesn't seem to care what others think. If they voice an objection, he spins a tale to convince them otherwise or spins a tale to distract them until he can physically persuade them. Schultz can't physically overpower his adversaries, and they frequently beat him to the draw, but once he starts speaking, he uses words to beat them. You get the sense Tarantino had a lot of fun writing and creating this character.<br /><br />Tarantino is a very good writer and each of his films is filled with great dialogue. If anything, they sometimes have too much dialogue and we spend too much time sitting, watching: a single conversation between characters that really does nothing but show how clever the writer is. In Schultz, Tarantino is able to show off his skill, but uses his talents to create an interesting, memorable character.<br /><br />They soon learn Django's wife, Broomhilda, was purchased by Candie (DiCaprio), a plantation owner who likes to pit his male slaves against one another in Mandingo-style fighting. Mandingo fighting is something that was featured in some of those films Tarantino loved to watch and this is his opportunity to combine two of his very different influences. There is no evidence this type of thing happened in this era, but it is the crazy type of genre-busting Tarantino did so well.<br /><br />DiCaprio clearly relishes playing a villain and he does it well. Candie is quiet and subtle, but no less menacing because of it. When he describes how he treats someone, or expects someone to act, it is clear that despite his tone, if his instructions aren't followed, people will die. And we quickly learn he has an entire squadron of hired guns ready and willing to fight and die for their boss.<br /><br />Samuel L. Jackson plays Stephen, Calvin's long-time, trusted slave who doles out punishment to the other slaves, gives orders to Candie's hired guns and basically oversees all of the plantation operations.<br /><br />When the group arrives at the plantation, the learn Broomhilda has been put in the Hot Box, at Stephen's directions, to teach her some manners. Django stays cool, barely, but stares at Stephen with confusion, unable to comprehend how one black person could willingly put another black person in this situation. Throughout, Stephen shows allegiance to no one but Calvin and his sister, afraid to upset the order.<br /><br />Waltz and DiCaprio are earning a lot of praise for their performances, but Jackson deserves as much praise. His performance is mesmerizing because you find yourself asking how this slave ended up in this place, ready and willing to dole out punishment and because Stephen is frequently put in his place by Candie, when he has overstepped his bounds or his owner disagrees. Candice seems to treat the older slave as a child, giving him a proverbial slap on the hand. And Stephen quickly laughs these moments off all too aware that if Candie's mood were to change, he could end up in a Mandingo fight against someone twenty years younger and one hundred pounds heavier.<br /><br />The most interesting thing about Broomhilda, Kerry Washington's character, is that she grew up with German plantation owners, receiving a German name and learning their language. She uses this knowledge throughout, giving her a way to communicate in secret.<br /><br />Many notable people take on small roles, adding flavor to the film, giving the viewer small surprises throughout. Some of them are so brief you might not catch them.<br /><br />\\"Django\\" is an accomplished film made by a filmmaker working at the height of his talents. But Tarantino has a tendency to go on too long. In \\"Django\\", part of the ending seems superfluous and gives the end a bit of an anti-climactic feeling. It almost becomes \\"too much\\", shifting the balance to the wrong side.

B009AP2G26|2.0|I loved First Season of Glee, I enjoyed second & third. I had high hopes for the 4th but it just left me with a sense of blah until it left me wondering 'why am I watching this...'.  The separation of the gang, the 100% transition to mini music videos of the top songs of today instead of plot demanded songs from the range of time and genre, and overall the loss of strong acting talents leaves this season as the one proving that it should have ended when graduation came.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I eagerly awaited this after reading the rave reviews. I finished the whole series quickly because it was compelling and interesting. I will say, however, that I was uncomfortable by some of the sex scenes. Damien Lewis is a favorite actor because of Band of Brothers and it was hard seeing this kind of graphic stuff.  I generally don't like sex in TV shows or movies either -- just always feels like something intimate that should be on the screen.  Other than THAT, this was excellent series and I'm looking forward to getting Season 2.
B004HD61KE|4.0|Lately it seems so many popular books are not very well written, with James Rollins you never need to worry about that.  The writing style is always well done and the plot of this book is such a fresh idea.  I won't get into all the details of the story, there are plenty of other reviews that seem to be attempts at a thesis that you can read. The characters just get better and I find myself wanting to know more about them and when the story ends I want to know what happens next....sadly I need to wait a year or so to find out. For me, if a story can get me to sit down for hours on end, entertain me, keep me on edge, and make me forget about the crappy week I might have had, that author has done a great thing.  This author continues to great things, this story is more proof of that. I highly recommend the whole Sigma series!
B000UJ48VI|5.0|If you were aware in the 60's regarding this movie you would understand why it was so controversal. It is funnier than hell and beat the rating system which did not make a lot of people happy at the time.
B009KNPNT6|5.0|This is an excellent remastering of the original disc. The 2nd disc is an excellent sounding live performance. Highly recommended.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|this is a great book, this series is my new favorite. THANKS RICK<br />for all readers that liked the Percy Jackson series and the first two books you will love this one<br />Be sure to read this<br />I have to go read the next book in this series bye.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I didn't know what to expect from this book, but I really enjoyed reading it.  It was an interesting presentation of events that kept me wanting to read more.  I wonder how the movie is.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|I enjoyed this sci fi movie.  It wasn't that it was completely fantastic, but there are so few sci fi movies, and this one was at least interesting and worth watching.  It was highly reminiscent of some aspects of the excellent Alien series, and we finally thought it was the prequel to Alien.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|Such a sweet movie that is so very bright in a dark animated world. A perfect balance as always by Tim Burton.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Very nice reader! It's like having everything in a digital magazine.<br />I love the layout and how easy it is to use.

0345536886|5.0|I liked David Zinc from the moment he started breaking down in the elevator. This is a fiction where good guys win doing good things for the underprivileged. Characters are real and depicted with very little prejudice, stories are woven with humor and candor, author's value and perspective clearly and cleverly shone through dialogues. Reading this story gave me a little push to live my life with more conviction. Live it simply but following the priorities; God, family, and friends as always. Do the right thing, fight the good fights, and never look back.

B00005QY5Y|5.0|Gold (2001) is my all-time favorite Ryan Adams album. No question. Well... Jacksonville City Nights (2005) might stand shoulder-to-shoulder. But Gold was my first Ryan Adams experience and that usually means something. I can barely remember how I found him. Back when the most popular browser was Netscape I used to spend hours looking for new music on CDnow.com following their \\"You might also like these artists...\\" links and downloading song samples on limewire. I think that's how I found it. Don't worry, I always bought the album (if the music was good). I'm kind of traditional that way.    Whether or not it's your first Ryan Adams album or not doesn't matter. Gold is Adams' second studio album and his most eclectic - rich with a classic feeling mix of genre influences including rock, country, and blues. His record company seems to have had some difficulties labeling the album - it was nominated for both rock and country awards at the Grammy's. The video for \\"New York, New York\\" played on country music TV channels but most of the album doesn't fit the glossy pop makeover of modern country music - it has more in common with the stuff from a few decades before. I once saw his music as part of a \\"Renegade Country\\" endcap at Best Buy, partnered with the likes of Wilco and Brandi Carlile.    When I say its his most eclectic album I say so knowing full well Adams full career span is prolifically diverse. Active for about 13 years now as a solo artist, he's released 13 full-fledged studio albums, four of which could be classified as double albums, with three releases coming in one year alone (2005's Cold Roses, Jacksonville City Nights, and 29). Each has its own distinct style that stands alone from the others while still being Ryan Adams. One is completely shredder metal. But the rich vintage feel of Gold is probably his most feel-good album.    Although there are no weak points on Gold, Adams' finest stuff is the run from tracks 2-5, which covers everything from heartsick love songs (\\"Answering Bell\\", \\"La Cienega Just Smiled\\") to rip-roaring harmonica tunes (\\"Firecracker\\") to transcendent blues (\\"Rescue Blues\\"). Take \\"Firecracker\\" for instance. A quick-driving guitar riff, Hammond organs in the back, and a soaring bluesy harmonica whenever Ryan's not singing lyrics like this: \\"So when does the plane go down? / 'Cause I'm gonna ride it till it hits the ground / Then go out with a fight / 'Cause I just wanna be your baby tonight.\\" It only gets better from there.    First these songs loosen you up. Then they excite you. Then they make you blissfully melancholy. And finally they leave you feeling kind of grateful. Some have said the best music, literature, film, art, etc., leaves you changed after you experience it. It invigorates you to the degree that you know its more than just entertainment. You're a different person after experience it. If you're not feeling that after the 9-minute blues journey story-song of \\"Nobody Girl\\" or the simple hard-rock driver that is \\"Enemy Fire\\" than maybe you just need to turn up the volume or put on some better headphones. I understand that maybe it won't have that effect on you. But maybe you'll get that lovin' feeling. Or maybe I'm just holding on too tightly to that teenage emotion.    For the aficionados and Gold-lovers out there look for the deluxe version with an extra disc of songs - Adams originally meant it to be a double album. Seeing as how he's on my Top 5 it really was an obligation for me to get it once I found out about it. There are a couple gems on there. And if you made it this far and wondering when I'm going to talk about \\"Summer of 69\\" then please hit the self destruct button on your computer now as the internet has failed you.    Full review: <...>

B009NYF2ES|5.0|When is Amazon gonna filter out the non relevant reviews to a particular item?  I'm not interested in the Instant Video version of Cabaret or the old DVD release when I'm searching reviews of the new Blu-ray release.<br />My title says it all about the Blu-ray of Cabaret.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|True to Form, Nicolas Sparks puts out another story of loss, struggles and overcoming. I was able to read this in one sitting as I neglected other responsibilities.<br /><br />I am pleasantly pleased to see that his books stay uniquely separate from each other and yet, holds the same themes of love through them.<br /><br />Well done.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|I bought this on the strength of their song &#34;I Miss The Misery,&#34; but I've found five or six songs that I enjoy even more.  This album has something for everyone, from straight-up hard rock (&#34;Rock Show&#34; has been stuck in my head for weeks, and I don't mind) to reflective, more melodic tracks (&#34;Beautiful With You&#34; begins a three-song breather from the metal edge), to then end with &#34;Here's To Us,&#34; an anthem that I wouldn't be surprised to hear at sports events.<br /><br />Many times, bands will attempt a &#34;something for everyone&#34; album and come up with a disjointed mess.  In the case of &#34;The Strange Case Of...,&#34; Halestorm has accomplished it brilliantly.  This will be a tough album to follow!
034580404X|5.0|I am not a big reader, and I originally got these for my wife.  When she failed to read them I picked them up, and let me say this is a phenomenal set of books.
1609611543|3.0|This books is not much different from books I have read about food allergies.  If it can be purchased as a used version, I would recommend getting it used.  Overpriced for what it is.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|this is a very cheesy game but very adicting cant put it down. get this app its worth installing it and is great for kids.
6304712936|5.0|Amadeus was an excellent Movie, very well done, music excellent and customs incredible !! Story is not factual; I recommend it
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game was worth the money. I had a great deal of fun playing it. There are many twist and turns. It also has fun and challenging puzzles.
B00B7G3BUW|5.0|...even down to the animation reflective of Frank Miller's signature style.  Peter Weller brought life to a story that has been beloved for over twenty years, and I hope that he does more voice work in the future.
B000OPPBEQ|4.0|My own fault for not checking that this was the letter box version and does not fill the screen. Otherwise it was a good value for the complete collection.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|seriously, now I get the addiction. Love the music in this version and the different challenges at each level.  Have to fight the hubby and kids to play.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Right now I have it and it is frozen and no matter what I do it doesn't work for me.
B004KU832S|5.0|This is a great product by Brio. Extremely well made. Came on time. This is a perfect gift for a  little boy loves trains..
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|It was alot of fun. I like the combo of search and trying to put it all together. It could have been a little longer, but it was good.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|I've always wondered why someone would pay $200+ for a general admission ticket to see a group that had its heyday decades ago. Watch this concert and you'll understand. Glenn Frey and Don Henley have written and continue to write some of the best songs ever. Bringing Joe Walsh on board years ago was a terrific move (can anyone say \\"The James Gang\\"?). He provides great guitar, some unusual vocals and some much needed humor.<br /><br />Eagles, it is easy to say are a much better, tighter and musical band than they were in the 70's. Yes, additional instruments helps especially the horns, but the harmony these guys display in their playing and vocals is absolutely first rate. The other thing that shows up in this concert is that these guys practice very hard and want to put on a good show. And they do. I suspect, like every musician, wish they could play more new stuff, but audiences respond so well to the classics that they will continue. To the Eagle's credit, they make all their music sound fresh and original.<br /><br />One thing you can say about the Eagles is that they don't cheat you on their effort. Essentially this is an update of the 2-Disc DVD and now obsolete HD-DVD previously issued.  This Blu ray package includes the 175 minute concert and some additional interviews as part of the extras. The Blu ray is beautifully transferred in 1080P with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  The thoughtful direction minimizes quick cuts.  Included is a lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 audio track along with LPCM Stereo.  Note: The Blu ray jacket says DTS 5.1 Surround but it is in fact DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.<br /><br />The Eagles are more than 4 these days, at least when they tour. Here there are 8 additional musicians including a horn section and some terrific guitar work by Steuart Smith who replaces long time band member Don Felder. Skimpy on new material, the boys manage to add some verve to the 30 songs here. They are one of the few groups from long ago that manage to do that. There is no denying their impact on popular music over the years. They are great musicians, excellent song writers and can harmonize as well as anyone. They remain relevant in the music world which is evident by their sold out shows across the world. Here is a track list:<br /><br /> 1. The Long Run<br /> 2. New Kid In Town<br /> 3.

B009RH973I|2.0|I've had this case for just about 2 1/2 months The shell color has faded and looks old and the soft flap slips and slides. I am very unhappy with this product. It is not attractive or easy to hold while reading. I read the  reviews and thought this would work for me. I have another Kindle and the faux leather cover and color has held up well and its been a couple of years.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|great game fun for my entire family! could beeasier to get stars and at times&quot;freezes&quot; but super fun and addictive!
034580404X|5.0|the books are great, loved reading them... they were shipped fast and i couldn't be happier... they were even gift wrapped..
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is the best book in the world!!!!!! It was so awesome and I loved it!  Everybody should read this book!!! I want to read it again!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game. Its. a major update to temple run original. The only thing I don't like is some times the reaction is delayed or not done on time. For example when I turn sometimes it will just go straight or maybe ill hit something but the reaction is a little slow but everything else like the look and display is way better than the original so yes go get this game and plus its FREE!!
B0014KFV6I|5.0|A classic album of great melodies and outstanding lyrics.Carol's voice is just as good now as when Tapestry first came out.I still find myself listening to this album after all these years,it's that good.
0517543052|5.0|ram dass is amazing. this book will take you to ancient times and back again. there's nothing to describe what this book will do to your consciousness and subconsciousness!!
0545265355|5.0|After watching the first one on TV I couldn't wait for the other 2 to make it to the theaters so i bought this set and it did not suprise me a bit. Book 2 was so exciting that i read the whole thing before I put it down and the same with the 3rd. Great books!!
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|Not meant for mature adults, or mature teens for that matter.I'm glad  didn't pay a lot for it. Sorry I read it.

B009X01FJS|5.0|Two ways to use. Very nice. Wish it had a built-in light like my previous cover. Good quality and durable.
B00AF6B22E|4.0|One of Denzel's great movies.  Took a little time to get into it.  But it is well worth watching.  I would recommend it to all.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Mockingjay is an exciting and unexpected end to Hunger Games series. I shed a few tears and thought about something like that really happening.
B009O07NDY|5.0|I loved the film and the music is what creates a great atmosphere. I love listening to the music in this film
B005MMYBXI|5.0|I loved this show.  I missed it on the original airing.  I saw Spartacus the second season in total and most of the first season.  This season had a different tone because Spartacus had not yet arrived on scene.  I loved the backstories.  I actually would have loved a full season.  I am so sad this year is the last.  There is so much to love.  The violence is sometimes hard to take but the stories are great.  I loved Gannicus he makes Gods of the Arena for me.  I will definately miss seeing him on my tv but I have my kindle so he can live forever there.  If you like the Spartacus series, then this should not be missed.
1596354208|5.0|Although this book was written for the shuttle tatter,[ I use a needle ] i still found the instructions easy to follow.  This is not a book for a beginner.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have always been a horse lover and I used to have one. but I busy recently dicoverd that I developed a survivor alergy, and this game was a great step in getting used to it! I love the game!, and if you have allergys like me me,  get this game!
0446672653|5.0|Couldn't put this book down, it was mind blowing and have recommended it to many friends. Only love is real.
B000W746GK|5.0|This is one of the best movie from the Harry Potter collection. Enjoy the enchanting tale & fantastic special effects. Story Line is never boring and the actors are spectacular.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I saw this in the theater, bought it on VCR, and then borrowed DVD from the library. Had to buy my own.  Do NOT miss the director's commentary!
B0099116AY|3.0|I had looked forward to watching this movie because of the recommendation of others.  Being beyond middle-age, I did not find it funny, dark humor at best.  The bad aspect is that I like Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep as actors, but there was no chemistry in this movie as far as I was concerned.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Every once in a while an author hits the scene who has so much talent and imagination and expertise that once you start reading, you truly don't want to put the book down.  This is such a book, written by such an author.  I won't go into detail about the book, you've already got over four hundred reviews, I just want to add my voice to the clamour.  This book is stunning.  I haven't yet read her first two, but I will be buying them and reading them.  But THIS book really has it all.  It almost, at one point, reminds me of the movie War of the Roses, but it's so much more.  Having been married a time or two myself, I have to say I smiled my way through the second half of the book because it's at that point the real fun begins, and fun it is, especially for a reader who has waded through the mire of a marriage gone bad and lived to finally laugh about it. It's just brilliant, the way Gillian wrote especially the last half, when you really get to the truly down and dirty part of these two peoples' minds, and although it's awful, it's also wildly funny to watch these two go at it. You get this, \\"Oh, God, why didn't I think of that?\\" vibe over and over again, and you laugh to yourself even more, and race to keep on reading because the two of them are so diabolically horrible, hilariously so.  Now, don't think from what I'm saying that this is a comedy, because it's not, it's actually gory and tragic, but if you've ever been involved in a marriage gone bad, it's pure entertaiment, the last part especially.  FABULOUS!
B004SIIBGU|1.0|Downloaded this to Kindle Fire HD and then tried several basic searches I use all the time on eBay.  No hits.  Really?  Nothing in &#34;books mysteries&#34; today?  No &#34;quilting fabric&#34; at all?  Deleted app.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I workout 6 days a week and love hitting weights hard. Some days you want to do something but don't have the time to do an hour workout. These quick 20 minute workouts are great. Super effective and you can make them as hard as you want by modifying or adding higher weights. LOVE
B0067R0APK|1.0|Ok, I bought this on sale, but I think it was a waste of a dollar. Very little difference from the free version. I had hoped that it would at least autorotate to the screen orientation, but that did not happen. Not too thrilled with the paid version. For those that are looking, stick with the free one, the upgrade is NOT worth it.
B007SXB498|5.0|I am really enjoying reading the classics and for some reason enjoy reading more on my Kindle.  I was never much of a reader before.
B000SVZIGC|5.0|Me and the kiddos loved this movie.  It did have a few scary parts for the young ones but all in all a classic.  If you get the chance check it out, I think its better than anything hollywood is pushing out right now.
B006QANR5I|5.0|If you ordered the PBS version of Season Two released in the U.S. you already own the 2011 Christmas special. It is the 9th and last episode on the last disc in the Season Two set. Now, if you ordered the U.K. edition with no \\"PBS\\" labeling at all at the top, with small red and blue \\"dime\\" sized age ratings on the front,back, and spine, you will need to buy the 2011 U.K. Christmas Special. In addition, to help out would-be owners of Season Three: If you own the U.S. PBS version you will already have the 2012 Christmas Special \\"A Journey To The Highlands\\" It is the 9th and last episode of the third set. I hope this helps. I checked Wikipedia.com , and IMDB.com for more details, and I own the entire series on blu-ray.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|It has only been a few days since Chris' death. I knew who he was from a tv program he had done last summer and was so impressed with his overall presence and humbleness that when the news broke I was saddened beyond all reason. I wanted some way to connect all of the pieces of his journey so I could get it into my mind why he had survived four tours in Iraq only to come home and have some idiot shoot him for trying to help him. But, that was who Chris. Always wanting to help make someone else's life a little better. This book.also helps one to understand a little bit about what our military is doing to protect this great nation and its freedoms. The horror of war is tragic, but as long as we have people like Chris on the front lines, you and I can lay our heads down at night and sleep peacefully knowing our borders are being defended by hero's we will probably never hear about least of all know their names
B007EC27QM|4.0|This calculator was easy to use. When I needed to quickly to do a calculation. the calculator. was readily available. The calculator added a much needed. function to my Kindle!

0374158460|5.0|Got it for my brother and he loved it.  He says Jonathan Franzen books are great so I chose this for him and he really enjoyed it.
B008L1DNGI|3.0|What more can I say about a free app?  The rating should give you a clue to what I thought it was like using it.
0375826726|3.0|The first two books of the Inheritance Cycle series were great.  This one continues where the second left off, but this book is very slow-paced and it seems that Paolini was having trouble deciding how to end Eragon's story.  So this one felt more like just a pause in the action even though it had the most actual fighting.  Still, it does fill the time between the second and final books so if you like the series then you should read this one instead of just skipping it.
B000VT7AUS|4.0|Brings back fond memories when we all were younger and music was more subtle.It's good to know this genre hasn't been forgotten.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Simple, easy, with the 4 basic functions of math. For free I figure it is a good app to my Kindle.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|Denzel was brilliant in this film about addiction, loss,and lies. The flight scene was utter chaos never seen a plane go down with such realism. A must see!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great ending to a great trilogy! Just as you hoped for the happy ending it is delivered and in the same romantic steamy way you would expect
B007JCP8FE|4.0|I like shinedown any way this is right up there for them. If your a fan don't hesitate! Buy it!
B008CPZNL6|4.0|Current as well as interesting news items; e.g., background info on Downton Abbey. I especially like the tech section which has updates on the latest phones, tablets, etc. Attractive layout. I would recommend this to anyone who likes to keep up with current events.
B00AGJ4HC2|4.0|First off, let me say that I love Amazon. However, this game is priced quite high right now ($48). As the other reviews have noted, there are only 16 cards in the deck - that's quite a small game for the current price. Even if you include the 4 \\"helper\\" cards, the wooden \\"tokens of affection\\" used for scoring, and the red velvet bag the game comes in, there's not a lot there.<br />I recommend finding this game at your friendly, local game store instead.<br />I have played this with men and women of various ages and I haven't heard a single complaint about the game itself. While the theme of the game is a bit like a romance novel, even the most masculine of people I know quickly overlook that detail and have enjoyed the game immensely.<br />Another reason to find this game at a game store is the card quality; they're not heavy duty cards and this game will get played a lot if you own it. So, pick up some sleeves while you're at the game store and protect your investment.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This is a very interesting story, well-researched, about a fictional product of the US foster care system whose salvation is her obsession with flowers and their meanings.  It is touching and thought-provoking and causes readers to think about what happens to these vulnerable children caught up in a system that sometimes helps and sometimes completely misses the mark.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|It is hard to compare the best Bonds to one another (Connery, Moore and now Craig), but this is definitely D. Craig's best Bond movie, and it is probably in the top 3 to 5 Bond movies ever.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a must buy and will not disappoint.  The book absolutely leaves you wanting more and it is delivered in the rest of the series.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|My daughter and I loved it in the movies and on DVD really got us into mood for Christmas .Get it!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love this series.  Hope they don't try to Americanize it.  Not much difference between the US and UK version so don't let that stop you from ordering it.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|I bought this for my granddaughter, 6 yrs,  who needed some organizing in her bedroom.  She loves it and actually picks up her Barbie items now.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really love this game I feel like I'm really taking care of a horse I would love to see every one play itself
0486409511|4.0|I thought this was a nicely written book. She gives a bit of history, which I really liked, before moving into discussing the tools and technique.  I took a class about 15 years ago and bought this book to refresh my skills. I don't know that I would be able to master Copperplate with just this book alone without having had hands-on lessons, but that might just be my learning style. Regardless of the fact, this is a book to have in your library of you are interested in fine penmanship.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great follow up to the Fifty Shades Series.  You were left off wanting more from the first book and this one delivers! Darker for sure and absolutely mind blowing!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am not a prude! But seriously  it was horrible I got through half the book and thought, this has to go somewhere any where ! Verbal porn is still porn and I couldn't help but imagine the author doing research in adult shops reading about the product and thinking, \\"humm this sounds unpleasant , I'll use it!\\" Boo! A ridiculous premiss and even more absurd hype.  Lesson learned  ill do a hard pass to the next book or books this author writes.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|I love these authors and have read all their works (together and on their own).  I'm a Pendergast fan.  It was good novel that tied up lots of questions regarding many of the characters; however, I was a little disappointed in the ending.  Not the most memorable of the Preston/Child works; but I'll keep coming back for more!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is really fun! I like how you can join games with people near you and how you can build really anything!! I think this game should be priced lower than $7.00. Other wise it is a really good game! I would recommend it to anyone interested I building.
1439152802|5.0|\\"The next thing happened quickly.<br />It was the liquid silver flash Laurel would always remember.  The way sunlight caught the metal blade, and the moment was briefly beautiful.<br />Then the knife came down, the special knife, plunging deep into the man's chest...\\"<br /><br />It was 1961.  It was England.  She was a girl of sixteen years of age.  This moment would forever haunt Laurel.<br /><br />Kate Morton easily transitions the reader from present day England with Laurel, a now famous actress well into her 50's, back to 1941 during \\"The Blitz\\" where we learn in bits and pieces of the mystery of why that day in 1961 happened.  In a most wonderful way I felt like I was reading two novels that were being carefully blended with the author's mastery of time travel.<br /><br />Laurel is determined to unravel the mystery of the death of this man.  Her Mother, Dorothy, who is in very ill health, surrounded by her family for her ninetieth birthday, is key to Laurel finally understanding what truly happened that day.  Her family's secret.<br /><br />This is the first of this author's books that I have read and it will not be the last.  THE SECRET KEEPER heralded characters in Laurel, Dolly, Vivien and Dorothy who were each given a voice by the author to tell their story.  A mystery filled with shocking turns and subtle twists.  I'd like to say that I figured it out before the ending.  But I didn't.  I really didn't.

B008MM9630|4.0|Lose the Christmas and snow. I love the game, but the increasingly high cost of crystal items is discouraging. It can take many days to complete one part of a quest. I now detest blueberries.<br />When I first played this, it was really fun. I was just fixing to write a glowing review; finally, a computer game that was fair to the player. Shortly, it began to change. Now, it takes so long to do some things that you can lose interest. A shame. Really, really detest those blueberries.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|This game is really fun! The only thing is that the first Toca boca hair salon was way better because it had way more people to choose from. But anyways it is fun! :*
1451695195|5.0|I really enjoyed the Proof of Heaven book because the authors near death experience was different from those that I have read. The way he told the story was very detailed in his logic and confusion due to his science background. I was very pleased with the book. I learned alot and was very moved emotionally. It's one book I won't forget and will share with my friends.  I'd just like to thank Mr. Eben Alexander for writing it.

B008CPZNL6|5.0|There will always be a new way to organize data or news that seems ahead of its time, almost inhuman in the way it so seemlessly carries out its purpose. This is more than what it claims to be, a magazine. It allows several dimensions of navigation, rather than one or two that would be in a traditional news reader. Flawlessly, it creates a panel of news stories that adapt to the screen, resizing and reshaping items based on characteristics of the collection on a particular page. each story feels like a magazine article when being read, you're no longer just viewing that article on a tablet or phone.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|If you enjoyed the first Sherlock Holmes movie of this series, or just enjoy a witty action movie, then I recommend this movie to you.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I think this is a REALLY helpful app for any holiday, event, etc. I use it to look at different hairstyles, crafts, and more! I think anyone interested in anything like that should get this app!
0470424656|5.0|This book is has been helpful in getting me up to speed on how to value a company. It's great for those looking to get into Asset Managment. It might not get you a job, but you'll be more comfortable talking about the stuff.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Cannot wait to see the movie!  Wish there was more to the ending.  How do is Katie do after?  Change  her name?
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Quite unforgettable. There are so many stories within this story. For anyone who knows that flowers are magical and healing - this is for you.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|well I used to love &lt;3 the normal game but as soon as temple run 2 game came out it was so mutch more addicting to play.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|This DVD arrived at a perfect time and in perfect conditiion. This is a great movie about an unsung musican. I love this story of such a great humble musician.
B00B1MJ02K|4.0|Lovely, yet did not top his other two romantic offerings.  Romanza is without exception his best and most exciting work.
B002NTGKSM|3.0|OK, so I know its Tim Burton so I should expect it to be weird, but Jeez, this was really weird.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is so fun to hack into I love seeing peoples faces when they least exspect it 5 stars
B008B8AOQI|5.0|I wasn't sure about Passenger's voice at first, but the CD, and his songs, really grew on me. I love the ballads.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best. Its very addictive.  You will fall in love with it. Cant get enough of the action.  I tell a friend about the game every day..  I now hold the highest score out of my circle of friends.  I hope they keep making different areas to go too.  So the game will stay interesting.  As soon as you master one board another one pops up.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|This collection was worth every penny. I love LOST and having the entire series on blu-ray is one of the best things I could ever own. Not to mention the sheer amount of extras included with it and all of the insider footage. Great purchase for anyone who is into LOST.
B00942V1J4|5.0|It's a good movie sad yet some parts are so funny. I like the idea that a male vampire doesn't freeze yet a woman does. It's so funny laughable. But it's fun to watch. So I do.
B007URVZJ6|1.0|It points you to go this way or that way.<br />It leads you down a path of many unanswered questions.<br />It gets you frustrated and makes you think,<br />why doesn't Amazon come out with an iKindle Author Like iBooks Author for the iPad.<br />I Just don't get it.<br />I've tried to make my book with lots of graphics and it's just not user friendly.<br />I don't know where to go from here.<br />I had to give this a 1 star because it just didn't help me. Sorry
B0064NTZJO|5.0|I wasn't sure how good this movie was going to be but it was excellent. Ryan Gosling is great. Also the Blu-ray was so clear and the ultraviolet was amazing as well. Good product.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Happy with this game of Solitaire. No crashes and it's a good way to zone out every now and then by playing a game or two.
0062082353|5.0|This is a good read. I have read lone survivor and no easy day and all of them are great
B001MNFOIW|4.0|I don't think for one moment this movie ever took a rest. WOW! I'm a James McAvoy fan, so after starting this, I couldn't stop. Although I had recently seen him in Becoming Jane, I was a bit turned off by all the swearing. It was unnecessary for him to do that as the violence was already evident enough to get that message across. Very cool effects!
B0015DROBO|5.0|Amazing!  The first 100 pages are hard to get through but once you do the story line keeps you guessing.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|You will get lost playing this game, it is a great way to take your mind off the world. Great way to relax!!!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|It is fantastic to have a free version of AB Rio available! Also, the free power ups given each day are a really nice addition. This game came just in time for my son to have on a long flight. Definitely a 5 star edition. Now if only the Star War's edition would go on sale or have a Kindle Fire version for. 99:)
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I like it for the most part, there where ups and downs and &#34;er, really?&#34; parts but it kept me going until the end.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|My baby nephew loves these and of course I spoil him rotten. This is actually his second one.  He loved the first one so much he wore it out
B0063IH60K|5.0|If you like card games and you'd rather play solitaire to while away some time, this is a good app. I like the 'celebration' after winning a game. I like the challenge of random deal rather than knowing you're going to win with 'winning deal', but everyone has their own preferences. Better than keeping a deck of cards in your purse! :-)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is an emotional roller coaster. With every new shocking discovery, the reader is left feeling great joy to utter devastation. My heart bled for each character as I felt the pain in the choices they were forced to make.  This is unconditional love at its finest. It really makes you think about right and wrong in its true form, and how it is sometimes the exact opposite of what our justice system dictates. I could relate to the main character a lot and loved the way she could express her emotions in words that made the reader feel like they were living through her experiences themselves. I would recommend this book to anyone!
0316228532|5.0|I had only read The Philosophers Stone from the JK Rowling stable before purchasing The Casual Vacancy. The Casual Vacancy is the best book I've read for ages-a real page turner. It was incredibly readable, the characters were painted exquisitely and the way the author overlapped and developed the characters was very clever. Every sentence was important and relevant, the subject matter unexpected and unique, any Tory wife would relate to the character of Samantha-absolutely brilliant.I challenge any of the critics to have come up with such an original plot for a book-just accept Harry Potter is at an end and move on....
B00B3MN65K|4.0|My wife loves this music and that makes me happy. Perfect for Valentines day. Also (don't tell her) a great price.
B005HEVBGG|5.0|Just what I wanted.

B00065MDRW|5.0|loved it now as much as I did then, sounds amazing on an Ipod! Something I didn't have when I first purchased the alblum years ago. And as usual great Amazon service.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Well written, page-turner, historical.  I loved this book and highly reccommend it.  Makes it hard to start another book after finishing The Kitchen House...
B00B2V66VS|3.0|gets boring after awhile and takes forever to lvl up. i quit playing after lvl 6. can find better things to do with my time
1451695195|5.0|Is an amazing man, in an evolving world of Spiritualism, Eben documents the events from his amazing journey that turned him from skeptic to believer.  His education as a man of science gives him a type of credibility that is refreshing.  His honesty is heartfelt and his overall message of love is inspiring.  If you've always felt there was something more but allowed skeptics or your own doubt to get in the way this is a truly great read.  I feel blessed that Eben documented his story for all of us as it has truly changed my outlook on life!
B00005JKDR|5.0|Just what I wanted.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|This is one of the greatest trilogies ever in my opinion. I've always loved Batman. I watched re-runs of the old 60's series as a kid, then came the '89 film with Keaton and Nicholson. That absolutely blew my young mind. Never thought another Batman movie could top it, but I'll tell ya, The Dark Night series is just fantastic. I could watch these flicks over and over again. A great investment at a great price.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's a great sequel to temple run  it's really fun new thing and better graphics I'm glad they decided to make another temple run
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|Eerily similiar to some of the great hard rock albums of the 70's & 80's. Lizzie has one of the best voices in rock today, and her lyrics are great. Get this if you luv hard rock, may be the best record in the last 10 years.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|I have fun this this game it keep your mind working  and is enjoyable.I try to beat my time from the last time.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|This is a fairly well written set of three books.  I saw the Hunger Games movie first and then wanted to know more.  This trilogy is an easy read and an excellent deal.
B00004R9A4|5.0|Just what I wanted.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book  never lost my interest, I was biting my nails through the entire read. I was never expecting it to be that type of story! I'm so glad I read it!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Crazy fun with the physicists and their ladies. These folks are NUTS! The writers must have a good time doing the scripts because the hilarity comes through. Amy's pursuit of Sheldon may end up with her living with Penny, but who cares?
0307346617|4.0|Answered my questions about the whole thing.  Well done.  Flowed well.  Hard to put down.  Can't wait for the movie!

B0000DZ3EN|5.0|Just what I wanted.
B00BCG1ZQO|5.0|Fantastic show. Superb writing, editing and acting.<br /><br />Just one thing... feel sometimes it's getting a little too serious, so bring back the funny. That twisted humor melded with the scary and the gory is the secret ingredient to this show. Great lines...<br /><br />- Bobby:\\"Now are we done feeling our feelings? Because I'd like to get out of this room before we both start growing lady parts.\\"<br /><br />- Fan convention organizer describing a panel:\\"And at 4:30, there is the Homo-erotic subtext of Supernatural.\\"<br /><br />- Dean: A Hand of Glory? I think I got one of those at the end of my Thai massage last week.<br /><br />Dean: Where's our father, Meg?<br />Meg: You didn't ask very nicely.<br />Dean: Where's our father, b*tch!<br /><br />Dean: Angel or not, I will stab you in your face.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|The Following keeps me thinking of the characters throughout the week and I can't wait until the next episode.  The writing is superb and the acting follows right along with it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I've had a great time playing part 2 but it's been frustrating because I've had to twice remove the game from my Kindle and reinstall it after it crashed.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I like it for the fun of playing solitaire the old way. It a time passer and easy to do and fun.
B003PIUC02|4.0|I bought this for my son for Christmas.  It was priced right.  Took just a few days to get to my home.
6305784116|5.0|Just what I wanted.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|The material is super soft and so she loves to hold onto and pet at it. Very cute.. everyone that sees her with it OOOooss and awes. CUTE!
B00AQMQBKK|5.0|This is an engaging and difficult game. You take on the role of 4 investigators trying to chase down clues to stop an ancient evil from awakening and devouring the world.  You take on a series of dice matching investigations with a diverse group of investigators, each with special powers to influence your dice rolls. Hours of fun and challenge!
B003MYYJD0|4.0|Beautiful, impressive, incredible accuracy, but.....too big. Nevertheless the rubber band is not enough long (at least one inch) for the wrist needed to carry it, due that I put 4 stars instead of 5.It is a watch to atonish the crowd not to be used daily. I expect a good quality in the gold finish. Regards.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Love it....I am addicted. I feel like a Goddess. Lol My desire to build and create is highly satisfied....ten stars!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The plot, the cast, the cinimatography....all very well done... I Hope that the story has another opportunity to be continued
0142405809|5.0|Donaldson and Scheffler have once again managed to write a beautiful, meaningful, empowering story complete with easy to read (and listen to) rhyme and wonderful illustrations. This book seems to encourage a love of nature and travel, while instilling the message that even very tiny creatures can create big changes.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|It was an intriguing book but not as good as previous books by Cornwell.  It dragged through a lot of medical mumbo jumbo.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is one great app to determine battery life. Even more interesting it is free to the user. It is better than some paid apps.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Great CD!!! It's a great CD to listen to anytime or anywhere. We are going to buy a few as gifts.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|It really takes you on an unique family journey during a very sad time in our history. The strength of the slave mother and father  was extremely evident throughout the book.  I was disappointed with the ending of the book. It seemed almost like an after thought.
B004Q7CIFI|4.0|Classic king with nods to some old Derry characters...Great in the beginning slow towards the end a good read overall.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Better graphics than you would expect. Not very interactive in competition but not a big deal if you are looking for a new horse game to play. Fun and easy to play; any age group would enjoy this game.
B008N1V11U|4.0|could of been more like the movie but still a great app.So if you like Batman or just want to play a good game you should buy this game even no its $6.99
B001BC5HXG|5.0|I really enjoy reading the book. It was very interesting,intense and very descriptive of the characters and scenery. As I was reading the story, I felt like I was there moving along story; Once I started to read it, I didn't want to stop.  The author was a brillint writer.  Surely it's a 5 stars book.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I loved it!  I wish I could give them more stars!  It's well worth the money because I listen to them all the time.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It was good reading another really fast moving novel by John Grisham.  It was the type of novel that once I started to read it, I could not put it down.  I would highly recommend this novel!
0446569895|5.0|Loved this book it showed a side of Ozzy i've never seen before. The details of the plane crashing into his motohome had me laughing to the point I fell of my chair.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Very scientific and clear which is why I felt it drug on with the repetitive return of the same facts.<br />Oh, and know you do not have to read the celiac section of you don't have celiac disease.<br />Have seen the positive effects of this change and will be following it in the future but this could have been shorter and a little less offer the top.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It's hard to put it down! It's suspenseful, romantic, and dramatic all the things you would want in a love story!
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|This movie was extremely raunchy. Some parts were funny, but some were over the top. Would not watch it again. And any women dating a man with a raunchy talking teddy bear would just kill herself at some point
B006O6F932|4.0|This has already been opened and closed about a million times. Nothing is breaking or is in danger of breaking. It's really cute and is as pictured (except for the dolls, of course). I love this for my kiddos....... ok, maybe I play too. ;-)
0064430170|4.0|My daughter Loves this...most this. I enjoy reading this story to her, we have even made a game of it. we say good night to almost everything in the room, she seems to prefer this sometime to the story....
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I couldn't wait to read this and was not disappointed.  This book, of course, is more focused on Annabeth.  She is my favorite character in the series.  I love how this turns out!
B005ER6STG|4.0|Had heard about this movie and had a tough time finding a copy to watch.  After watching I was half appauled/half entertained by the gory and sadistic nature of the film.  Overall though, well written.  I was expecting a grainy film with a horrible plot line but was pleasantly suprised.
B007L6VR6M|3.0|Watched this one twice...at home. His movies just don't seem to warrant having to be seen on a big screen because the stories are always intimate and charming but not really cinematic masterworks that rely on a grand visual scale to have impact. It was fun and slightly eccentric like all of his films, but I almost felt like this one was starting to become a little formulaic. It just didn't stick with me like Rushmore or Royal Tennenbaums. Still, I'll eagerly look forward to what comes next and definately make the effort to see it.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Love this show, the writing, the sets, the fact that it is a period drama, the actors wish it would carry on for 10 seasons!
1439153663|5.0|The story is told by Lavinia, an orphan taken into a southern family, and Belle, a daughter of the plantation owner, and one of his slaves. However, I found myself most drawn to Lavinia. As I often do, I read the author's notes prior to starting. Lavinia is of Irish descent, had two brothers, and lost her parents and younger brother en route to this country. She seems very bright but needs affection so much. As she begins to remember her family, I couldn't help feeling sorry for her. Her tender heart and consideration for others makes her a cherished member of the household.<br /><br />The author does an excellent job of describing how the common treatment for depressed women like Miss Martha, wife of the plantation owner, actually made it worse. Her son, Marshall, is a troubled young man. I suspect that he was sexually abused by his tutor.<br /><br />Another interesting character is Meg Madden. I quite liked her. She's intelligent, curious and strong willed. The Maddens are uncle and aunt to Marshall and Lavenia is sent to live with them to be educated. When her engagement falls through because her fiance tries to rape her, she marries Marshall. However, she finds herself ensnared in an impossible situation where she is unable to help anyone, even herself.<br /><br />As the novel spiraled to its end, I just couldn't stop reading. There are deaths, beatings, and more but to know how the story plays out pick up this novel for yourself. Marshall is the primary culprit. He was surely a product of his upbringing, becoming a warped mad human being who is unable to find happiness or love. What happens as a result of his madness and out of control behavior is sad and frightening. Nevertheless, I'm glad I read this one. It's emotional, gut-wrenching and a most outstanding read that gives a view of what life as a slave was often like on a southern plantation.  I can't say I loved it, but I will not soon forget it.
B003DT19F0|5.0|I love it - I am collecting all 5 of these movies.  I still have one I need to order.
B000F4RHB6|4.0|Huey Lewis & The News were far more successful in the States than here in the UK. However that said they did gain some popularity in the mid eighties briefly on the British charts. All the songs are very 80's American rock'n'roll and were helped by great videos on MTV. The album is great for nostalgia and the songs all still sound great if very dated. Perhaps wouldn't appeal initially to a new listener of rock music but highly recommended.  The band also won Best International Group at The Brits (UK Grammys) in 1986.  Fun Fact: The groups album 'Fore!' went 2x Platinum in the UK and finished in the top 30 best selling albums of 1986!  Career album/singles sales in UK: 820,000/250,000 = 1 million  3.The Power Of Love: US#1, 4.Jacob's Ladder (Step By Step): US#1, 5.Stuck With You: US#1,
B008XBASVY|4.0|Carson reminded me of a modern-day Holden Caulfield.  Although his classmates are depicted in an exaggerated way, there is a grain of truth that alienated intellectual youth can relate to.  The book is very funny, but touching and sad at the same time.
0634060384|5.0|A must for all musicians, very useful tool for budding artists.<br />of all the music my eyes been squinting at, this is like<br />putting on shades. eyes are like \\" ahhh! \\" I can READ! with you-tuber & Panda Ora<br />as your guide, one can go to music collage for under $30 -<br />...sorta...kinda. the rest is, how bad you want it :) so get back to work!
B004HW7JH4|5.0|Need I say more...well..and Joan Harris...and the writing..and the sets...AMAZING series...so sad it there are only two more seasons! WHAAAA
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game that when you start getting the hang of it, it becomes very addictive!Me and my kids fight over who.gets to play next!
B00A6SZS2Q|3.0|I've been a fan of the Black Veil Brides since their first album  'We Stitch These Wounds' came out. When I listened to &#34;Set the World on Fire', I was an even bigger fan. So of course, when they put out another album, I had to buy it. Then the disappointment set in. &#34;Wretched & Divine' isn't all bad; some of it is badass BVB music. However, that is a small part of it. I think they went a little soft on this album. It would have been better with Andy's screams, and they just weren't there on this one. I got into this band because I think they are talented musicians who play music I enjoy with a singer who has that sexy voice right along with the growls & screams. But that's not this album.<br />My advice- check this out before you buy it if possible. I'm glad I bought it to complete my collection, but I'll only be listening to the other 2 albums.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun and fast paced game that can burn up a lot of time when you want to. Some times its too fast for my old slowness but its still a lot of fun .
1452113432|2.0|I frequently judge a book by its title and cover and that's what I did with this one.  It made it sound as if anyone could fix fabulous French food with minimal equipment and maybe minimal experience too.  Although I'm a seasoned cook who's taken many classes and owns virtually every gadget known to mankind, that made me want to get a copy as quickly as possible.  Well, the book is beautiful to look at but that's it.<br /><br />Is there someone alive who's interested in French food and doesn't know what Boeuf Bourguignon is?  (In the index it's listed as \\"Burgundy beef.\\")  When you turn to the recipe it says in big red letters \\"Boeuf bourguignon\\" with the translation underneath and it's the same with all the recipes.  What's up with that?  I see from some other reviews that this book is derived from a BBC series.  So, did the editors feel it needed to be dumbed down for Americans?<br /><br />I really don't like the organization of the recipes.  Ingredients are not presented in a list but in a running narrative, making it somewhat more difficult to get a coherent \\"game plan\\" together.  The \\"French Basics\\" at the end are a nice touch but not compelling enough to make me want to keep the book.<br /><br />If your idea of a great cookbook is something written by Ina Garten, then I don't think this is for you.  Instead it made me want to take another look at Barefoot in Paris.
B0061S073A|2.0|I use the kidmode app on my android phone. this app can not even compare. kidmode can also be used on computers. you should try and compare. avail in iTunes store as well.
B000I3PERS|5.0|One of the best movies ever...instant classic.  Mel when he still had all his mental faculties intact...FREEDOM!!! Who can ever forget it?!?
B00B01XDTI|4.0|I enjoy the franchise more then the movies I sincelry will say!<br />That and hell its way longer and that way more to take in and a growing building block of a plot then a breif , hasty movie.<br /><br />The movie was fun, dark and mysterious though! Though I still think movies these days use way too much cgi for entertaiment.<br />So the movie was fun but rushed and so much is left out in comparison to the games.<br />I hope to one day see more but would have more respect for it if it were every to have a movie produced by the japanese.
B00005ASOC|5.0|I have recommend this film to many people. I watched it for a class and found it riviting! Get it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I've been so addicted to the game and it's awesome, but theirs never any other players on, and minecraft is really fun on multiplayer. other than that it's perfect.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|Heard one song and after getting the cd enjoyed all the tunes...Like to hear more from them. Was a good pic for me.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book has the saddest twist ending ever, but it's the most endearing story ever. For real, this is the best book ever.
B004132HZS|5.0|Love this show!!! Benedict Cumberbatch is the best Sherlock Ever :) there are only three episodes, but each are 90 min long.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|In true Phillip Phillips fashion, he stayed true to himself on this album. I was so happy that he didn't end up doing some cookie-cutter pop-ish album that wouldn't fit his style. This one is in constant rotation on my ipod.
B000002UZ6|4.0|I have loved Tina Turner for many years.  This collection of her music is really put together in a great line up.
B008G12ERC|3.0|This album does leave a strong impression at the very first listening, something I can say about few albums today. The latest offering from The Black Keys is another one that definitely fits this profile. I generally like acoustic and raw electric blues, rock and roll and alternative rock so it is tricky for me to shake my leg to such an electronic album. However, Muse gets the job done.<br /><br />The opening song, Supremacy has some strong parts to it as far as music goes though lyrics are a scarce commodity in that number. It does offer some effects-ridden guitar parts that I did enjoy listening to.<br /><br />Madness follows and immediately you are taken with its more electronic feel, from the programmed drums to all the layered sounds. However, this pulsating profession of mad love is an excellent song, with simple lyrics that do justice to the general mood of the song.<br /><br />Panic Station starts on a very strong note and I must say, sports a very 80's feel to it. On the same note, the chorus is reminiscent of Thriller by Michael Jackson (do have another listen to the line, \\"And this chaos, it defies imagination\\"). Nonetheless, this is one of the strongest songs on the album and addresses the topic of getting off your butt and getting things done.<br /><br />Survival is another strong track, once again with positive and simple lyrics, a catchy beat and a chorus that has a very orchestral feel to it. The guitar solo is also quite nice; this is one of the more rock-sounding tracks on the album and for a moment you lose the electronic feel.<br /><br />Follow me did not fly with me; it sounds like something inspired by one of U2's songs but a poor attempt at the same. The lyrics are mediocre, the beat changes three times during the song, never managing to grip you by the collar.<br /><br />Animals - This song is quite bare bones, once again partially relinquishing the electronic feel and starting with just drums and rhythm guitar (think slow Pearl Jam tracks like Last Kiss). The lead guitar offers some nice melodies and the almost primeval lyrics (fitting with the title) go well with the rest of the composition.<br /><br />Explorers picks up slowly but I felt it was a weak track; a simple song about feeling positive and liberating one's soul from the shackles of everyday life. Lyrically, it is one of the strongest songs on the album though.<br /><br />Big Freeze - To a person somewhat familiar with U2, it may seem like it is one of their tracks. However, I have listened to every single album from U2 and can assure you, the influence is dramatic. It may be a good song but feels just too much like a U2 cover; I felt the meaning/essence of the song was lost in its resemblance to U2's work. (Remember the album was mixed by a person who has spent a lot of time with U2)<br /><br />Unsustainable is a let down for me; perhaps an attempt at modern art in music but for me, a lover of all art, it was quite ordinary.<br />I liked the opening to Isolated System and think it serves as an apt ending to the album.<br />-<br />All in all, the greatest achievement of Muse in this album is that they experimented without any scruples and did a very good job too. Fans and critics will now truly struggle to attach a label to Muse in terms of genre and style. I hope they continue to experiment in the future and that upcoming albums have more good songs in them than this one did.
B004EPYZSK|3.0|Certainly not what I expected after all the hype. Actors did a great job with their performances. Was certainly a twist for a SciFi. Entertaining all the same.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I absolute love this game....I  played dragon city on Facebook and this game is a lot like it a very good game
B005LAIISA|5.0|Always fun and love watching all the ice age movies with my grand daughter.<br />Love the creativity and of course our favorite nut chaser.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|love the series - would give it five stars if Amazon would offer close caption directly to the tv instead of having to use xbox or PC for viewing.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great end to the series. Underlying themes are amazing broadcast through Collin's words. I am glad she didn't make it a \\"fairytale\\" ending.
B002SR2PKG|4.0|It's one of Stephen King's better books. He captures the pain and fear of childhood and the discovery of friendship almost perfectly. Only complaint is that the last thirty pages or so really undercut the legitimacy of the whole thing.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|Mia and Michael were fantastic. The best version I have ever watched. When Meryl Streep gives a shout out to Mia for her performance, what else is there to say. A great love story, well done.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|Love this movie, great fun. Very creative and<br />full of heart. Waiting for more. Ray Romano<br />is the best voice for Manny.
0307594165|5.0|Morrison's deft compact style and storyline are back! This book works like SUla and Bluest Eye; it clearly, straight-linedly delivers a complex, multi-layered narrative; it haunts.
B000Q6GUT8|4.0|THIS MOVIE CAME QUICKLY, WRAPPED REALLY WELL, PLAYS VERY WELL, GREAT PRICE, MY HUSBAND AND MY FATHER IN LAW LOVE THIS AND WAS LOOKING FOR THIS ONE, THANK I WOULD BUY FROM YOU AGAIN.
1594744769|5.0|This was one of those books that not only caught my attention instantlly but held me enthralled throughout! I am looking forward to book two but I do appreciate the author taking his time on it. Although it may not be everyones cup of tea it sure was mine!
1475143389|3.0|I gave this book a 3 star review and here's why.  I enjoy reading these types of books and do so casually on a regular basis.  This book may contain some information someone completely new to the field may find useful,  but I would still recommend other books for a first read.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was that the authors reference to scientific findings are rather lacking,  and in a field like this with so much here say,  this is essential and the bibliography (which this book does not have)  should be extensive in any fitness book you take advice from.<br /><br />Also,  the section on nutrition is mediocre at best.  It simply does not provide enough information or formulae to help people of all body types.<br /><br />But i want to end on a good note.  From checking out the authors Site he seems to genuinely care about responding to questions and ensuring people see results from his program.<br /><br />Advice to the author,  keep up to date on the latest journals in this field bc there are books available that make this one look elementary.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Well written ficional account of a courageous 16 year old beating the odds in cruel fight-to-death contest. Can't wait to read the sequel
B009UX2YAC|4.0|love it but my kindle fire does not like it I can not turn very well.  You should get it I am on Rio world tour
B008Y1RTUG|4.0|We chose this movie because it wasn't your typical Snow White version. I have older children that like movies that have the same feel, not so fairytale-ish.  The start of the movie is great, doesn't drag, takes you into the movie and really tells you the background of the story. The only thing I didnt like was the storyline between the huntsman and Snow White. It sort of leaves it to interpretation, their relationship or how they feel about one another.  The ending is another part that I didn't like.  No, dialog, took to long...kinda dragged. Otherwise...I liked it...we bought it and we have watched it a handful of times already.
B008J34466|4.0|Pink always puts out a good album.  I am thrilled that Amazon also put it on my cloud, so I can access it any time.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|so good movie  lot of drama, and all so it show how the alcohol can finish with your life m
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I listened to this and the next in the series, Shadow of Night,  from Audible and have been very impressed by the quality of the writing. Thank you so much, Deborah, for sharing with us!
B000A6T1HC|5.0|Simply a beautiful recording of a seemingly perfect performance by both Cecilia and by the Les Musiciens du Louvre. The music ranges from lively pieces(\\"Sparga il senso lascivo veleno\\") to subliminal, ethereal works of art (\\"Vanne pentita a piangere\\"). I find the entire recording to be absolutley captivating and rewarding. The timbre of the period instruments really come through nicely on the recording, adding to my enjoyment immensly.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Cecilia Bartoli, baroque music, or any vocal classical music, I can easily recommend this recording. In my opinion, this is equal in quality to the \\"Mozart Portraits\\" recording, which is quite a high mark to achieve, indeed.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|One cannot deny the attraction of the Hunger Games movie and the great casting and screenplay based upon the popular book series.  What makes this DVD set unique is the very detailed 'making of' segments on the extra disk.  It is about as long as the movie itself if you watch it all!  It covers every angle of making this fascinating movie, from location scouting, to set design, costumes, special effects, martial arts and weapons training for the cast, the director's vision, how some elements were added for clarity that were not in the book, and how the movie is (to my mind) actually a better vision of Susan Collin's world than might have resulted at others' hands.  The amount of thought and work that goes into making a movie is clearly evident, and the supplemental videos will take you through the entire production, and beyond to the opening and fan events after, plus interviews with most of the main cast.  Highly recommended.
B0067EKY9K|3.0|Got it because of the reviews and Oscar nominations.  It's a nice, pleasant movie, but not an Oscar contender, in my opinion.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I love to be able to listen to music and purchase music at the same time. Its also great to have access to the new releases or by genre even on my phone!!! Wonderful APP for an android!
8866130915|4.0|I was expecting it to be larger but it suits my purposes and has a surprising amount of room to write everything down.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I have to say I am sorry this book ended. I have never had a book bring out so many emotions.  I really enjoyed th characters and the fast pace. Read it you won't be disappointed.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is great! I can't believe how much fun this game is; I play it for hours. If you like a challenge get this game. Also try Flow Free Bridges; this is also a great game. The price is also right FREE !!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I couldn't set it down when I started reading it!! I can't wait to finish the series! Enjoyable and exciting!! :-)
B00B3MN65K|5.0|I adore Josh Groban's lovely baritone and his new album delivers!!! Brave is so uplifting and I love to hear more than just English on an album! Exceptional as always.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|I liked 's Flynn.<br />STYLE OF WRITING,BUT THE PLOT WAS TOO BIZARRE TO BE SUSPENSEFUL. I will try another of her novels before I make any snap judgements of her as an author.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best app ever.<br />I play it RELIGIOUSLY.<br />It's that good.<br />Although it's kind of choppy, but I think that may be the device.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I love this app it is awesome the third level was kinda hard but I beat it in the end
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|loved the book! i wish there were more books. plan on reading all of them again and seeing the movies.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|The best series ever! Looking forward to the next season. I don't watch anything else. No need for more words.
B00992CF6W|2.0|On survivalcraft there's a ton of different modes!only for 99&cent;.it's awesome you gotta try it.survival,adventure,creative three modes in the game.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The main character, Victoria, unfolds like the progression of a flower from a closed bud to a fine blossom. This is a beautifully crafted story that will pull you in and hold you through the end.
B0042C1BP0|5.0|I love this movie. Daniel Craig is the best James Bond ever.  He is so cool and so tough. I want to watch it again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Do like temple run? Well this game is just for you, filled with trains coming at you, you will never see what is coming next.
030758836X|2.0|Could not put this book down and found myself wanting to know the conclusion of all that transpired between Amy and Nick, with alternating chapters about each of them.  Eyes burning from reading so much...then came the end!  I kept turning pages to see if this was some kind of a joke and more would be written...no such luck!  Wanted to recommend this book but cannot due to the ending.  What on earth was this author thinking except that both of these characters are just plain SICK!
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I love that this book read exactly like, how I would assume, Tina Fey would talk to her audience. While it was a funny book, I found it was lacking substance outside of the humor which is what I think the purpose of this book is-to give you a glimpse of her life and many a laugh. I wouldn't have bought this book if it weren't for everyone's raving reviews,
B005NFW0U0|5.0|I'm still watching this series!  I love being a prime member and being able to stream video when I want to watch something like this series
B009HEJXFS|1.0|This was a dumb movie. I did not like it at all. I did not even finish watching it. It was a waste of time.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Great book, loved every moment. One of the best zombie books I've read. This is what a true zombie apocalypse would be like.
B001EBWIUO|5.0|While the ending was somewhat predictable, the movie was a fun, mostly family-friendly adventure movie. The violence is very tame by today's standards, though some families with young children may find some of the gun violence and talk about murder by some of the characters in a &#34;Wild West&#34; setting to be a bit too much. Great adventure film with solid acting, of course led by Humphrey Bogart.
B004SDEP38|1.0|None of the things on the app work. For most of the options you have to buy the full version for fourteen dollars. This app is horrible and a waste of time. If you want something where you can create documents don't get this app. Doesn't  deserve a star.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I like this game when it loads. please fix it. it wont open very often. needs an up date please
B004UPAIKI|5.0|Watched this like 6 times...always something new I see. Great movie--ran and played well!  I would tell a friend.. thanks!
B008H08XW2|5.0|This is my first Maroon 5 cd and I can't stop playing it.  I love all the songs although I have been skipping 1-3 and playing from 4 on.  1-3 you hear on the radio all the time.  Because I enjoy this cd so much I want to get more of their cds.  I sing with all the songs and crank it up LOUD in my car.  I would 100% recommend.
B000OV85AW|3.0|While the movie was well-made, it was long, and I was surprised at the content for a movie rated PG. Not family friendly as it contains nudity and sexual situations.
B004U8VWLE|2.0|I was really disappointed in this movie.  First of all, you knew at the start of the movie how it would end.  Then you had to guess what was real and what was not real which seems to be the thing for movies coming out now.  I didn't think there was anything deep in this movie.  Would recomment you select a different movie.
B004LROUNG|2.0|Not read  selected<br />By mistake a b c d e f g h I j k l m n o
B00ANW33CM|5.0|We have only had Mahjong Delux2 for less than 24 hrs. but we are both addicted to it. It is both fun and exercises the brain by testing ones memory skills.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|What a fun logic game with cute characters and sounds. I only wish there were more worlds and levels!<br /><br />Hope more is coming soon!
0061733199|5.0|Bought for my boyfriend and he loved this book. He highly recommends it. He has read the entire thing and said there is a lot of very interesting information that everyone should know in it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Probably the most recognized game.  The first one I put on my kindle fire hd because of its familiarity.  I have played it more than I thought I would.  If there were the same version ad-free I would definitely get that one.
B000002MY3|5.0|This cd is awesome, brings back memories from the 80's!  She has such a beautiful voice!<br />Would recommend to anyone!
B0086700CM|1.0|Not my kind of game.  I like a game that makes you think and wears you out when you play it.  This one doesn't.
B0049U4NQO|5.0|A great thriller with lots of adventure and danger. I would recommend this book as a #1 read. Overall this book was awesome!
0765325950|5.0|The book was Outstanding! I will miss the characters. Wish it could continue. I would love to find out if matt lives...  (o:
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I chose this game to see why it has become so popular.  I ended up liking it more than I thought I would.  However, I found the ads very annoying and replaced this game with the ad-free version.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Beautiful color!  Dropped kindle on the floor the other day and this case saved it from breaking!  Very nice and affordable case for kindles!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game.  It makes you think about how to solve every board.  To me that is what a game should do..make you think about it.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|Great 3D experience! And a new take on a love story all in one. Enjoyed it a lot even though it took a while to watch.
B00683JK9K|5.0|Good variety of puzzles. Ease and challenge in completion. Would recommend to other who enjoy doing puzzles.<br />A good value
B004SBQGHS|4.0|I have never been much of a game player but chose this one because it seems so widely played.  I do like it; I just need to learn more about it and I think I will like it even more then.  I first selected the free version that is ad-supported but replaced it with the ad-free version as I found the ads annoying.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|If you are looking for a good horror show this would be the one!  Season 1 was also awesome!  can't wait to watch the last<br />couple shows!
B0054JZC6E|2.0|Not my kind of games.  I like games that make you think and wears you out when you play it.  This one doesn't.
B003U6BE8I|3.0|Movie was enjoyable.  Story was fair.  I think I was bummed when they went to demi-god camp,and their was a bunch of other kids training already..  It took some of  the magic out of the movie.
B008JF8O9M|4.0|Works great with pdf files. Was easy to link in with my network printer. Dose'nt recognise all files but I'm still working on that.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Lots of fun and great graphics. Wish it wasn't so expensive to get presentation equipment but otherwise great game.  Excellent for any horse lover.
B000OW8DW6|4.0|I saw the movie first - and really enjoyed it. The whole premise and genre were right up my alley. Then I read the book and was shocked by how much the two stories differ. But, I enjoyed both versions of the story immensely.<br /><br />To me, the movie is a bit more on the dark and gritty side, but the book has it's dark moments as well. If you're into end of the world as we know it type stories, then I would recommend you give this a try. If you enjoy the movie, read the book for a slightly different take on the story.
B0063IH60K|4.0|What can you say about Solitaire.  You either enjoy playing it or you don't.  I enjoy playing it so this is a good game.
B009KHCT94|2.0|I like the idea, especially as a comedy, but I didn't like one person in it.  I also thought they could have done better.
B004SRNH10|4.0|I had to have this file to run some video files,I believe, It worked just fine with no hitches. Good.
0143034901|5.0|If you buy and read books on the basis of marketing raves, you run the risk of never reading anything<br />someone else hasn't suckered you into reading.  The Shadow of the Wind earns its high ratings, not by who<br />endorses it, but by the brilliance and strength of its writing.  Even though,at times, the author allows you<br />to get a sense of the conclusion, the telling of the tale carries it completely.  A very solid read, well worth<br />the price.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I don't normally comment on books, but I found this book to be so entertaining it would be a sin to not leave a review.  It's been a while since I've read a hard science fiction book and this was just the fix I was looking for.  Lots of typos which did bug me at times, but the main character and the plot kept me going.  Would definitely recommend.
B008MEM24S|3.0|This is an okay game but it is not my speed.  I like games that make you think and this is not one of those.
B00B0LPYXG|3.0|This movie is really about a man, and how he deals with life.  The opening just puts him in the spot light, and hot seat.  Good movie,  Interesting too.  I drink a lot, but wow, Denzel's character has me beat by a mile.  Not sure if they were just going on the extreme end for the character.  Well Prost!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I thought that this book was very good and was a great adventure for a person who has a great imagination.  Well done Rick Riordan!
B0053VKP8S|5.0|I purchased a &#34;soundbar&#34; for my anemic sounding LG flat screen tv - internal speakers pointed down toward the carpet.  The sound bar had an HDMI pass-through, but it only passes the HDMI signal when the soundbar was &#34;on&#34;.  I don't always want the soundbar on, so I bought this converter which is configured to take the optical output of the tv and feed it into the analog input of the sound bar (my soundbar does not have an optical input, some do).  I was able to power the FiiO D3 converter by using a miniUSB to USB cable plugged into one of the TVs available USB ports, which means one less AC power connection.  The sound is as good as that from the HDMI input on the sound bar and I don't need to have the soundbar on to listen to the TV.  Perfection.
B008LZHA3G|4.0|A very good Dylan album but not my favorite of all time. Many critics, however, think it is one of the best.
0425252868|4.0|I am a 65 year old man and have never teared up at the end of a book before...but that said, did become misty eyed at the end of this book because it is such an impressive and true story of the goodness of mankind.  Would have rated it a five star, except that I would have liked more of the book oriented towards the American crew aboard the B-17.  Well written account.  I liked the authors direct non-flowery style so much that I would definately look forward to other books written by him.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|It has its moments, but the ones you don't care for out wieght the good.  Just dumb humor, I should have known.
B004I11VZ0|5.0|This movie a better than the original IP man. It is a continuation, but better. You must watch both IP Man & IP Man 2 together to appreciate the full story
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Great sci-fi romp where an endless assortment of meanies, gamers, and virtually everything 80's collide.  I'm not a huge fan of computerized games in the real world, but the games in the book's world are described in deep, rich detail contrasting with an ugly not-so-distant future real world where it's far better to play the game.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This was an amazing book. I recommend it to all people who like some adventure. I love this book. Amazing is all I can say.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|The last thing I want to do when I'm busy and stressed is spend 15 minutes organizing my day. The good news? I can add something to W list in just a few seconds! Love it.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|I'll have to go back and read this book, as the movie didn't do a good enough job telling the back story.<br /><br />That being said, the acting was superb, Helen Hunt was amazing, and John Hawkes did such am incredible job I had to go look him up in IMDB to see if he was disabled. To portray everything he did, with only limited movement of his head was incredible.
B003INBOEM|4.0|This is a very good movie, but you need to see IP Man 2 to fully get and appreciate the whole story.
B0028R3NCU|2.0|Similar to some of the other low reviews, this thing worked great for me for about a month then konked out completely and was no longer recognized by the system. It's the third keychain adapter from various mfgrs I've gone through though so apparently this is common among these little things.
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|I have been an Eric Burdon fan ever since I rushed into my local record store to purchase \\"Don't Let Me be Misunderstood\\" as a 45 rpm single. A lot of water has passed under the bridge since then. It's nice to see Eric back as a senior reflecting on life. His voice has taken on a gravelly sound, and the lyrics of these songs are very introspective. My favorite is \\"Devil and Jesus.\\" It's great to listen to, but I'm also glad the words are included. \\"Wait\\" is very nice too. It's got a bit of the Spanish flair to it. From the Animals to WAR; from a solo stint to \\"Guilty\\" with Jimmy Witherspoon; and now \\"Til Your River Runs Dry.\\" It's been a meaningful evolution for this artist.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this games it's awesome omg<br /><br />You guys are gonna love this I love you you better LinkedIn game
B004VMUS9G|5.0|lots of options and easy to use. Love this app! Im able to custom make it to my wanymts and needs  and i program it to use my muaic already on my device!
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|GREAT! The ending was a little annoying though.<br />I love this. Must Read! Watch the no movie afterwords. I LOVE JOHN!!!!!!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great acting and dialog...  Leave it to the British to produce outstanding drama for TV.  Each season has been equally outstanding.
B009UZBLSG|5.0|I bought this for my husband and it works like a charm. We've had no problems with this SlimPort so far.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is both fun and addictive.I was introduced to it by a six year old and I am hooked!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I dated a quad 17 years ago for almost a year. I was madly in love with him but the reality and the difficulty of the physical condition was more that I could bear at the tender age of 25, with all my life ahead of me. We broke up and each went our own way. I thought this book was extremely accurate about all of it. The physical and mental difficulty of all involved. I cried more reading this book than any other and I am an avid reader. It is a touching love story beautifully written. Thank you for giving me an opportunity to revisit and reflect on a life changing experience.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Best game ever! Better than temple run! I can't even explain how wonderfully interesting this this game is. The graphics are amazing
034580404X|1.0|Well. I can honestly say that the entire week that I spent attempting to read this trilogy without boring myself to tears was a challenge!! I am an avid reader, and I don't think I have ever come across a book that baffled me. Well E L James, you did it! Not in a good way either. The book was extremely repetitive as most of the reviews have told, and the plot, was simply nonexistent. However, the idea of writing a character that is, as the author rights repeatedly, \\"fifty shades of F'd up\\"  holds an interesting idea. Although with the lack of any skill for writing, this idea falls, 49 shades short. With all the hype that this book brought, I truly thought I was going to be reading brilliance and wound up with garbage. For me, the worst part of the book was the terrible grammar, multiple run on sentences, most that any self respecting English teacher, or, editor for that matter would sneer at. And as it appears, the editor for this book, did not. I can honestly say, every time the sentence \\"Him and me\\" or \\"Christian and ME.\\" came up, I would start to grind my teeth. Growing up with a mother that majored in English, a sentence like that would get a well deserved correction in our home, something that I also picked up over the years. With English teachers in mind, this book brings to mind an image of my favorite creative writing teacher, reading a few pages of this, and tearing it to pieces, and saying. \\"do it again.\\" or scribbling the words \\"stupid. repetitive, boring, and a whole slew of other comments across it in bold red marker. All in all, this book a complete disappointment. Do Not Buy This, don't even waste your time. its not worth the hours you'll lose, or days for that matter, that you could have spent doing something more productive, like calling your Granny.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Excellent, it was so hard to put down! Well written. In some parts I felt like I was there. Don't normally read fiction, but when I do it's Lee Childs.
0439023521|4.0|This was one of our book club selections and I was not looking forward to reading it. While on one hand it sounded intriguing and I had already heard good things about it, the subject matter wasn't such a lure for me. In the future nation of Panem, a boy and a girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen are drawn in a lottery to be participants in the Hunger Games. The Hunger Games is an annual competition which takes place in the capitol of the twelve existing districts. The twist is that the kids must fight to the death. There is only one survivor.<br /><br />To my great surprise though, I loved The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins! It was interesting, suspenseful, imaginative, sad, a real yank at the heart. The book was an action-packed whirlwind from the beginning scenes of life in the village, to the lottery drawing, to the physical and mental preparation, and to the actual game itself. The game takes place in a controlled environment, a bubble of sorts, where the coordinators can manipulate the physical surroundings to influence participant action. I was on the edge of my seat as Katniss and Peeta pitted against each other fought for survival, then were urged on as a team, then to the surprise twist.<br /><br />And at the emotional end I was ready for the second installment, Catching Fire, and finally the third, Mockingjay. Because the books were short and easy, geared toward a young adult audience, I wasn't annoyed in continuing on (since I'm not a big fan of series). In fact, I was very enthusiastic. In the end I urged my husband and son to read the series, and no surprise, they both liked them, too
B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of sparks best! Not as  predictable as some and has an unexpected twist. A good but fast read! Recommended!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|good job imangi studios this isn't just another one and done I believe you guys did great with this game and I can sit for hours and play this or it keeps me occupied when I need something to do!
B001NHNG64|5.0|So far, I've not had a &#34;Reacher&#34; I haven't liked, and this was no exception.  Even though he's fiction, he's believable.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Although I loved the book itself, I was thoroughly disappointed in the LENGTH of it. Seeing that the price was only $3,I should have realized it was a novella, however I did not. Just when it started to get really good, it was over! I implore every fan of Stephen King: don't let the fact that it is a novella discourage you from buying it, you would be missing out on a great albeit, brief masterpiece.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This one was absolutely amazing.. i couldn't put it down. And i loved how things were coming from his perspective at the end... awesome 2 b in his mind... more more more!!!!!
B005IQZB14|5.0|I enjoyed every minute of this book and it went too fast.  Its been a dream of mine to hike the PCT, and this was a great place to start.
B004CYKZZA|4.0|The headset says it is good for 10 meters and I tested this.  It is true. Well worth the price and the charge lasts several days.

B003IEJZUG|5.0|This story was an amazing insight to the human psyche. The horror this boy endured could not be reconciled in his mind, therefore, to go on in an unbearable space, his mind took over and told a story that his conscious could bear to live with… an amazing story!
B00A80SHFM|3.0|quite like the music of this movie, however there are several tracks missing from what I want to hear again from the movie....<br /><br />during Huge Jackman recgonized Anne Hathaway was one of his employees<br />Anne Hathaway lying in bed in hospital \\"Cossette it's past your bed time\\"<br />The boy in the square singing in front of the rich<br /><br />also the first track... in the movie the scene starts from the bottom of the sea ALONG with DRUMBEATS... this is also missing in this soundtrack.... I mention because the moment from the drumbeat changes to the music (right at the scene gets of the sea surface)... such combination gives a very atonishing feeling....<br /><br />but generally, not bad. Quite ok.
B0090EHVMC|2.0|Ugh, used to love this book, but the movie did not capture the essence of the book.  They tried and Danny Devito's voice is solid, but the movie is slow-going and didn't maintain my interest.  Visually, it is beautiful, but the story is ho-hum.
B009H442DG|1.0|Really? I mean.... Really? 86 Five Star reviews for this thing? Do the marketing departments pay people to write good reviews?<br /><br />Here's what you should do: When reading a review, always check out the reviewers other posted reviews. If they have one review, and it's this, know that they are being paid by somebody. A good reviewer on Amazon should have several reviews of several different products, and not all should be five stars and call the Travola/Newton John duet \\"the best duet every recorded in history\\". You know something is wrong with that person, if they truly believe this.<br /><br />Look at the photos. Creepy. CREEPY.

0307352153|4.0|Quiet by Susan Cain was a really great read! This book explores the many facets of introverted personalities. You can tell when reading this that Cain really did her homework. There is gobs of research from a very wide variety of studies. While it is heavy with research, Cain does a great job of adding enough personality to keep you from being bogged down with too much information.<br /><br />Whether you consider yourself introverted or extroverted I think this is a great book to read if you're looking to learn something new on a very interesting topic. Everyone encounters different personality types throughout their lives and the things you learn in Quiet can definitely be applied to everyday situations and how you relate to others.<br /><br />Cain covers everything from how introversion and extroversion seem to develop and where they come from, to how different personalities work best and how our brains work differently. It's really fascinating stuff and she makes it readable and easy to understand. You don't need a psychology degree to enjoy this book.<br /><br />I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.

0345404475|3.0|Rick Deckard lives on a future earth following World War Terminus, which left a cloud of radioactive dust leading a large portion of humanity to emigrate to other planets, mainly Mars. Those who leave earth are given an \\"andy\\" (android) to use as they wish, usually as a slave laborer. Androids, which have become so advanced that they cannot be distinguished from humans except with special tests, are outlawed on earth, however, and those androids who escape from the colonies to earth are hunted down and eliminated. Rick Deckard is a bounty hunter who eliminates androids.<br /><br />The ultimate test as to whether an entity is human or android is a bone marrow test after death, but bounty hunters are required to be sure they are eliminating androids, not humans, by using a test before elimination that measures the subject's empathy. It seems that the android makers have not been able to include empathy in the DNA structure of their androids.<br /><br />Through a unique set of circumstances (including somewhat falling in love with an android), Rick perceives that he has developed empathy for his prey. He has a moral dilemma, for sure.<br /><br />This novel is interesting as it develops a theme of what separates the human from the machine. Machines (androids) can be more intelligent, more physically apt, but are they superior? In Dick's book, empathy seems to be the difference that makes humans superior. They care about other humans and about animals (which are rapidly becoming extinct because of the radioactive dust in Dick's created world). The question then suggests itself, when we lose our empathy, do we become less than human?<br /><br />Among Dick's interesting ideas for his fantasy world-of-the-future, the most intriguing is the mood organ, which stimulates various parts of the brain so that a person can dial his desired mood for the day. If this were real, I would dial a 481, \\"awareness of the manifold possibilities open to me in the future, new hope.\\" Sometimes, when I am bored, I might as well have dialed a 888, \\"the desire to watch TV, no matter what's on it.\\" I think many people are stuck on 888.<br /><br />Dick wrote this novel in 1968, and it seems almost prescient in its depiction of \\"machines\\" that are smarter than humans. The book is interesting and thought provoking; however, its plot is somewhat illogical at times, and it seems to be according to the sci-fi formula more than is usual for Dick. By the way, the film Blade Runner used the basic premise as a jumping-off-point, but conveyed an entirely different message.<br /><br />And this has just about the best book title ever.
0062231375|4.0|Bourdain wrote this book about 10 years ago and re-released it in 2012 with his own hand-written footnotes throughout the book.  The idea of what you think 10 years later intrigued me. It's interesting to me on what you think of yourself from 10 years ago. Do you still think that now? Do you like yourself? Did you really know that much?<br /><br />I have to admit I've never been a Bourdain fan. He always struck me as full himself, so I was particularly interested in what he thought of himself 10 years later.<br /><br />I really liked this book. Bourdain is a true member of the culinary world. He embodies the food and restaurant industry and tells it like it is. The book is smart and well written. I really enjoyed the footnotes. Some of the comments were on food trends that have changed over the past 10 years and some of the comments were about himself and he was a bit self-deprecating.<br /><br />Bourdain is a true character, smart and interesting. I think this book is appealing to anyone who has ever worked in a restaurant or enjoys eating out. My only slight disappointment is that I would have liked more footnotes.<br /><br />Incidentally, last night was my first visit to a restaurant since reading this book, and I really have a new appreciation for what hard work it is for everyone on the front line and behind the scenes.

1400032717|3.0|Christopher is a 15-year-old who loves and remembers facts and who is a whiz at math; whose literary hero is Sherlock Holmes because of the detective's adherence to logic in solving crimes; who relates better to animals than to people; who hates to be touched and refuses to look at others directly. He is autistic.<br /><br />Out for a night-time ramble, Christopher sees that the neighbor's dog has been killed, stabbed with a garden fork. Deciding to solve the mystery of the killing, he begins interviewing the neighbors, only to find out more secrets than he anticipated, secrets about his own family.<br /><br />Christopher is the narrator of this story, and thus the language is factual (without the use of metaphors and similes, which Christopher considers lies), and includes mathematical formulas and random facts.<br /><br />Author Mark Haddon does a remarkable job of telling the story through the eyes of an autistic boy. As Christopher relates just the facts that he knows, the reader is able to anticipate the truths, although Christopher does not. The reader not familiar with this spectrum of mental aberration can also gain insights about the thought processes involved and about the family pressures that can surround a child with this disorder.<br /><br />This book was very interesting, but I don't think I will ever read it again (which is, ultimately, how I judge a book). It was well-done in accomplishing its goal, but it seemed almost too educational. And that is not a bad thing for a one-read book but not a good thing for a multiple-read book.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|After losing her mother, getting divorced and falling into some bad habits Strayed, in her mid 20s, put her energy and focus into hiking an 1,100 mile portion of the Pacific Crest Trail, all by herself.<br /><br />I'm always fascinated by the courage of women to go off on their own, into the unknown. The book starts slowly as she talks about her relationship with her family, but it does help you understand her. It really picks up as she starts hiking the PCT. Strayed writes of the hardships, beauty and the mostly wonderful people she meets along her adventure.<br /><br />It's an enjoyable read for anyone with a sense of adventure.

B007FEZQF8|5.0|I started out by watching the first season of the walking dead on television. I heard that the series started out as a graphic novel and I was intrigued. After reading this book I can say for sure that any fan of the series should definitely read it.
0553386794|3.0|I am going to have to disagree with most of these reviews, which are glowing, and with the blurbs on the cover and inside-front of this book, which compare the author to Tolkien (The Lord of the Rings)and T.H. White (The Once and Future King).<br /><br />The plot has been outlined so frequently on Amazon that I will not even attempt it.<br /><br />Suffice it to say, Martin is not the new Tolkien or even the new T.H. White, although those authors do write of wars and include elements of magic. He is not even close to being as good a writer as either one. He could certainly be the new Robert Jordan, who attempted the same sort of \\"epic\\" series; in fact, that is the best comparison I can think of. But to give Martin his due, he does tell a darn-good story, and I did keep turning those 800+ pages.<br /><br />He has structured his novel cleverly, with each chapter being from the viewpoint of one of the main characters, with the action being simultaneous but in different places, to follow the multiple story-lines. And each chapter concludes with something of a \\"cliffhanger,\\" so that the reader keeps reading, wanting to know what happens next, wanting to get to the next chapter from the viewpoint of that particular character. This reminds me so much of the structure of soap operas, which use the same technique exactly. This book is, indeed, a multiple character, medieval setting, political, supernatural soap opera. And as with The Days of Our Lives,you become involved despite yourself. And afterward, you feel as if you have somehow lowered your normal standards, but you watch the next day anyway.<br /><br />However, some things bothered me all the way through. The writing was very uneven: Sometimes it is actually quite good, as in Catelyn's description of a battle at night: \\"The battle came alive around her. She heard hoofbeats, iron boots splashing in shallow water, the woody sound of swords on oaken shields and the scrape of steel against steel, the hiss of arrows, the thunder of drums, the terrified screaming of a thousand horses.\\" Sometimes the writing is very bad, as Martin repeats himself often and frequently misplaces modifying clauses and phrases or pronoun references, so that the reader is left adrift as to what is really being talked about. This example is actually very humorous:<br /><br />\\"Dany curled up on her side, pulling the sandsilk cloak across her and cradling the egg in the hollow between her swollen belly and small, tender breasts. She liked to hold them. (Woo, woo. This is getting risque.) They were so beautiful, and sometimes being close to them made her feel stronger, braver, as if somehow she were drawing strength from the strong dragons locked inside.\\" (She has dragons in her breasts? No, wait, the dragons are in the eggs I guess.)<br /><br />Martin is also very free with his depiction of sex, which is not usually particularly offensive to me, except that his situations are pretty off-putting: We have brother-sister incest, many instances of rape, sexual orgies, mentions of children with adults, sexual sadism, and only one mention of what might be considered normal sexual union. It just seems a bit sensationalistic.<br /><br />I realize that it was difficult for Martin to see the whole as he was writing a book this lengthy, but a good editor should have cleaned things up for him. I could have improved the book myself and cut about 100 pages by leaving out some of the descriptions of the clothing. In a dramatic and climactic scene where Lord Stark denounces the new self-crowned king, Martin interrupts the narrative to describe the wearing apparel of all participants. Really?<br /><br />If you love Robert Jordan, you will most likely love this book. If you love Tolkien, you will be sorely disappointed.hunder of drums, the terrified screaming of a thousand horses.\\" Sometimes the writing is very bad, as Martin repeats himself often and frequently misplaces modifying clauses and phrases or pronoun references, so that the reader is left adrift as to what is really being talked about.

B009OYTIXS|5.0|I love superhero movies and series.  I watched Smallville on CW faithfully for 10 seasons.  When it ended, I stopped watching the network because there wasn't any action type of series I could get in to.<br /><br />When I purchased Amazon Prime, the series Arrow popped up as an instant video suggestion.  I purchased it and was not disappointed.  The producers have done an excellent job of building the suspense and unfolding the various characters and plots.  I love how they give you different parts of Oliver's history on the island every week.  It keeps you intrigued and on edge.  And I love Green Arrow, because like Batman, he has had to build his human strength to become a hero.<br /><br />If you liked Smallville, and loved Avengers, this series will be a great weekly \\"superhero action fix\\" until the next Avengers, GI Joe, Iron Man or Superman comes out.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
B009MF56GC|4.0|Movie critic Joe Bob Briggs set a simple rule for making the perfect sequel, &#34;You make the same movie over again&#34;.  In that light, this was the perfect sequel.  Total &#34;check-your-brain-at-the-door&#34; entertainment at its best.  With brilliant use of over-the-hill/B-list action stars, funny dialog, great stunts and explosions, this movie has everything a growing boy needs except gratuitous nudity, which will probably diminish Oscar consideration.  I cannot wait until &#34;The Expendables 3: Get Off My Lawn&#34; becomes a reality.

B001J3U22S|5.0|Brian Herbert is loyal to his fathers vision for the Dune saga. He does not change the basic storyline. Instead he fills out Family-lines and great historic events from Dunes past.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|I admit I was skeptical in transplanting Sherlock to NY, but I was pleasantly surprised.  In the original stories S's drug use was used to relieve boredom between cases but here it is treated as a central issue and is the plot device used to unite Holmes with Watson. Watson, a former surgeon is now working as a \\"sober companion\\" and is hired by Holmes's father as a condition of his continued financial support of Holmes. Surprisingly this comes off just fine. I enjoy the interplay between characters. The dialogue is quite witty and Jonny Lee Miller brings a great energy to the role and captures the brilliant, maddeningly pedantic, and thoroughly humanistic Sherlock very well. Lucy Liu is quite good as well. The cases are for the most part clever and entertaining although the quality is somewhat variable. I especially enjoy Aiden Quinn who plays Gregson, the unflappable police captain. The cases themselves are generally entertaining and I haven't missed an episode.<br /><br />I do think that the recent UK series \\"Sherlock\\" is superior overall because the stories are more complex and very cleverly written as they transplant Conan Doyle's original work to the present. However the sheer volume in the American version and the difficulty in presenting new cases over 22 episodes makes the comparison a little unfair. But as a great Holmes fan, I welcome and enjoy both.

B0041KVW2K|3.0|first off let me say that i don't write reviews unless i'm forced,and it looks like i've been forced again.before going through the reason that i give this set 3 stars(which is what it seems to add up to when you calculate all the other written reviews together)something needs to be covered that most folks are not covering in the reviews,..AMAZON HAS GOT YOU COVERED!.i have not seen customer service like this in over 30 years,and i am not the type of person who likes doing business over the \\"interwebs\\"(or whatever they like to call it).once again,i had been forced to do something due to the awful experience you can and most likely will recieve when shopping in a retail environment.everything from rotten employees,to the item just not being stocked in the store in the first place.really,it's a game these days to make a purchase,but not at amazon,as far as i am concerned,and when it come to \\"customer satisfaction\\",they seem to \\"bend over backwards\\" to make things right in the end(if need be,and heaven's no!,.i don't work for them!)).now for the 3 star bit of the story,..ALL 16 VINYL ALBUMS IN THIS SET HAVE DEFECTS,AND I'M WILLING TO GO SO FAR AS SAYING THAT FINDING A \\"PERFECT\\" COPY OF ANY OF THE 14 LP'S/ALBUMS IN THE BATCH OF SOME 50 THOUSAND VINYLS PRESSED WILL BE LIKE \\"FINDING A NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK\\".you may find some \\"near perfect\\" copies somewhere along the line,but i wouldn't count on it.to be fair,this is not \\"something new\\"(pun intended)in the business of making vinyl record albums,however these vinyls have something supposedly called \\"non fill\\",and i have never heard this term spoken in my 40 plus years of listening to vinyl records,and what's more i have never heard this \\"zipper\\" like sound on any record i have heard in my 40 plus years either(it also sounds kinda like \\"passing gas\\" to my ears).had i not read this term here in some of the other reviews,i would have just thought it was some sort of \\"scratch\\",or defect,and then would have said to myself,\\"what in the world is that?\\"(actually,i did think that to myself when i played the white album,sides one and two,and had not bothered with reading any reviews yet).now i know what \\"non fill\\" is,and i've \\"learned the leeenon\\",but i've learned the leeenon before(with many things in life).this is not AMAZON'S fault,but they are \\"bending over backwards\\" to keep their customers,and i bet somewhere along the line there are some bad vaccuum cleaners(and many other items too) that amazon is having to cover for as well(maybe it's just a part of doing business?).hey,amazon is a \\"BIG\\" company,but most \\"BIG\\" companies wouldn't respond to their customers in the way that they have with me.got a problem?(contact anyone at amazon and see what you get,..live chat,..have you tried it?).someone will have to answer to this problem as the \\"complaints\\" are far too many(and in the beatle world that can be a very bad thing,trust me).also,this is not a first time problem for emi/capitol or any of the other fine record labels(check out george harrison's \\"dark horse\\" album cover for another clue).in finishing this \\"forced\\" review,i consider myself a bit of a \\"beatard\\"(sorry,i didn't make it up,but i have been called this before as i am not ready to be a \\"bbc member\\"(balding beatle collector),and i have to say that i have heard the beatles music forward,backwards,inside and out(btw,\\"inside and out\\" is the best way to listen to the beatles music),and as we all know that is not in question here.even the idea of \\"tweaking\\" the sound and not rerereleasing the masters as they were on the mofi box or the bc13 set is o.k by me,because behind all this \\"non fill\\" nonsense the folks at abbey road did quite a job,and they do sound better than the previous vinyls in that scope..the 2009 cds were just what dr. robert ordered(and he says they are \\"toooo much!\\" in many ways) and yes this 2012 vinyl set should have been the collection to satify all vinyl lovers,but unfortunately \\"somewhere over the rainbo\\"(no not you hudson!)it didn't happen,and unfortunately these days,nothing is made the same way it used to be(i'm not making excuses,i'm just \\"learning the leeenon\\").btw,i have a moderate turntable,and reciever,and some decent headphones,and that's all it took for me to know what was going on when listening to these new vinyls.well,\\"nothing to get hung about\\",i guess...p.s.for those of you who are satisfied with your set's,ROCK ON!....

B00AFARIZA|5.0|Most of these recordings, except for two CDs worth of material, are not included in last year's [[ASIN:B006VKKAWQ Toscanini Collection]].  All the recordings in this set, dating from 1935-1939, feature the British Broadcasting Company Symphony Orchestra.<br /><br />The repertoire here will be familiar to Toscanini enthusiasts: Beethoven's Symphonies 1, 4, 6, and 7; Brahms 2 and 4, along with selections by Wagner, Debussy, Sibelius, and a smattering of works by other composers.  The Maestro recorded all these works later with the NBC Symphony.  But these recordings with the BBC will come as a reminder that the most perceptive musicians change over time.  The performances here reveal several traits that were not heard in Toscanini's later recordings: liberal use of portamento, a marked flexibility in tempo, and a more generally relaxed, even casual style.  Many will characterize these performances as \\"warmer\\" than the more commonly known later recordings - and I can't disagree.<br /><br />One of Toscanini's strengths was his ability to find the character of the various orchestras he worked with, enhance their strongest qualities while improving deficiencies - with the end result being an orchestra that still sounded like itself, yet also bore the Toscanini hallmarks of unanimity of attack, transparency, and rhythmic vitality.  Such was the case with the Philadelphia Orchestra, where the famed Philadelphia sound was intact, and such is the case with these recordings with the BBC Orchestra.  There is a certain lightness to the string playing that is missing from the NBC recordings, which affects the character of certain pieces.  For example, the Scherzo of Beethoven's 7th Symphony projects a sense of merriment, rather than the frenetic atmosphere of the NBC version.  The woodwinds, however, have a slightly whiny quality which is distracting in some portions of the Brahms 4th Symphony.<br /><br />The set includes both live and studio recordings.  All the performances in this set were recorded in London's Queens Hall - sadly destroyed by a German air raid in 1941. The acoustic is much more forgiving than NBC's Studio 8-H (where Saturday Night Live is now performed).  Much of the remastering dates back to the original CD issues - as far back as the 1980s.  But the sound is always listenable, to the extent that some of Toscanini's off key humming is clearly audible.<br /><br />Considering its narrow scope in terms of repertoire and chronology I wouldn't want these six CDs to be all the Toscanini in my collection.  But this set makes an excellent supplement to RCA's recent complete Toscanini reissue.<br /><br />*Curiously, the cover art on my copy is slightly different than that shown on Amazon.  The Amazon copy is described as the \\"Complete HMV Recordings\\" whereas my copy deletes the \\"Complete\\".  Toscaniniphiles will already know that there are several items from these concerts, including the Geminiani Concerto Grosso and Cherubini's Anacreon Overture that have been issued elsewhere.this set were recorded in London's Queens Hall - sadly destroyed by a German air raid in 1941.

This is a unique story of love and personal discovery. It blurs the line between Sci-fi and fantasy but doesn't delve too deeply into either. It is quite unique! The Blu-ray version is great, so glad we upgraded.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|The story kept me from putting it down it was my second favorite in the series so far can't wait for the next book
B00B99KJR0|4.0|title of review says it ;  I'm completely addicted to call of Atlantis,  and this is quite similar.  I like match 3 games with a purpose beyond the matching, like these games
B006YC74E8|4.0|Since the Kindle Fire HD has no manual, I was wondering how to access the built-in cam. This takes great pictures. Drawback, it is tricky trying to get a picture without getting yourself in it as the cam is facing you instead of the other direction.
B0063M22QO|4.0|easy to use. challenging and fun.  worth buying for hours of inexpensive entertainment at your finger tips. however, very addictive.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a very addicting game! It's really fun to play when your trying to pass time! There is so much you can do and it nuver gets boring. Great game.. and it's free!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing it's really easy but hard at the Same time.it's like temple run but the characters are a lot better and there's a lot more going on!!xx
B005K17RU0|5.0|The 15 day forecast is very nice, the display of the radar is better than the Weather Channels app. Only minor complaint is that it doesn't change orientation.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|the game is a blast to play, especially if your a star wars fan. Good job birds. updates should prove to be fun.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|I work in an industral environment, and on the designing end of it I take a lot of pictures. This flash has made my life very easy for what i do. I take pictures of machinery, metals, cuts in metals, wear grooves, mating surfaces etc.I don't know, in that i can
0307352153|5.0|I loved this book, lots of great information that applies both anything from business to children. Very thought provoking and informative, while the ending of the book was rather blah, I enjoyed it very much as a whole.
B008I43DYU|4.0|This Calculator fits my needs perfectly. The simple change from a basic to a scientific just by screen orientation is nice.
8866130915|4.0|I love the format of the weekly planner with a page on the side for notes. It's the only format I will use. I just wish that for getting it on Amazon I could have gotten a better deal :/
B008D28HYS|5.0|Great game!!! It saves itself so you don't have to solve all at once.  The easy ones arent so easy somtimes.  Love it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Freaking awesome and addictive game! You gotta get this!  Fast and furious play!  Definitely fun for all ages!  Everybody will fight over whose turn it is!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Accessing my Facebook account is faster on this app through my Kindle Fire HD is faster than my Android phone. The pictures are larger too.
B00466HN6S|5.0|Loved it; grandchildren watch it about once a month! This is a delightful movie for all ages. Good price as well.
1857885082|5.0|This book is fabulously entertaining.  The author goes into so many aspects of British life and gives wonderful explanations of the customs and culture of Great Britain.  I do love it.
B00993FEUK|5.0|I'm so amazed by this movie or work actually, and my main focus here is the claymation/stop-motin and the fine craftsmanship & details of those dolls. imo it was a perfect masterpiece, in some scenes I could hardly tell if it was CG or not. the details & coloring were so good, also I have to give an excellence mark on those asymmetries (Norman's nose, aggie's ears ..etc). Really, that extra mile gave a fine wow empression. Perfect job .. its as simple as this. whatever the price of that BR is, it still feels like a steal :P
B005PK57NU|5.0|I purchased from Instant Streaming through my Blu-Ray Amazon App.  It was a perfect stream. Enjoyed the show. I recommend the Good Wife to anyone.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The creators really made part two very enjoyable. The game overall keeps you going from the beginning. Love it !!
B004CURZFC|5.0|Fun movie to watch. i wanted to see something new and this did not disappoint. to be honest it was a really great movie, not just for kids. I'm 20 and i enjoyed watching this in my dorm with my roommate over my shoulder hahahaha
B009GEFXLC|5.0|The video and sound quality were great. As usual, the episode was as well. If you love Castle, you will love this episode, particularly if you've been waiting for the sparks between Caslte and Beckett to ignite!
B007OWRBJK|5.0|I purchased the Kindle version because I am a huge Who fan and have been following this band since Tommy.  It gave great insight to one of the most influential songwriters of our time, Pete Townshend. While ypu got insight to the Who and some info time stamped.  You also got into the mind of a very creative individual.  His roots, what makes him tick.  How and why he wrote some of the songs he did..Baba O'Reilly, Quadrophenia and of course Tommy.  This book, is not about the Who it is about Pete.  You come away from this book feeling like you know him it is truthful, brutal and funny.  You also come away feeling that this is a generous, kind hearted soul with faults just like the rest of us.<br />I recommend this to anyone who is a Who fan or anyone who is interested in one of the foremost musicians of our time.  Bravo Pete!
B005LAII62|5.0|I watched this movie in the theaters twice. And loved it both times. Now I just placed my order for the blue ray and DVD.<br /><br />The movie was a bit on the scary side. As a grown woman, I was a bit scared in the beginning too and at one point thought to myself \\" WT heck? I thought this was a kid's movie!\\". Then again, I'm a chicken and don't usually do horror at all. I did notice kids crying and parents walking out but midway through the movie it settled down and you stopped being scared. Or even disturbed. And that is what makes this movie beautiful. It didn't surprise me that the director said he was inspired by his own experience as a kid bullied. I think anyone who has been bullied ( and dare I say bullied others) probably can see a bit of themselves in Aggie and Norman and the other characters.<br /><br />This movie was sophisticated and showed values of empathy, kindness, bravery, sympathy, acceptance and most of all, forgiveness. All of which Norman displays in his quest. I thought it would be a great movie for kids. Judging the response from some of the adults, they could learn something from this movie too.<br /><br />I don't believe the morality in the move was all over the place as some have mentioned. I kind of thought it was pretty consistent with what many kids who face bullying experience and the moral dilemma a society and it's people find themselves.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />I just saw the movie on DVD. Spoiler alert: The last scenes music is different from the movie in theatres. Too bad, because the music really made the scene in the end interesting. I dont get the discrepancy in the soundtrack.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Very good. It is told in an amazing perspective. I truly enjoyed this. Intriguing heartwarming fantastic. Even the pace of the story is just right
0446573027|4.0|Zero Day is the first installment of what I hope will be a long series of books with John Puller.<br /><br />IT IS TRUE...John Puller and Jack Reacher are very similar fictional characters.<br />But so what!<br /><br />Lee Child can't write fast enough with another Reacher installment, so I'll just fill in the gap with Puller.<br /><br />Zero Day is fast paced filled with action, adventure and a larger than life main character.<br /><br />There are two narrators - a male and a female<br />They are no Dick Hill (The master of all narrators and coincidentially the narrator for the Jack Reacher series) but they do a very good job<br />And there are accompanying background sounds from time to time - a nice touch<br /><br />I'd like to see a future book about how his brother got into his predicament - and of course a resolution to the matter<br /><br />I recommend this book!
0385484518|5.0|This book is so touching and heart breaking. It literally had me in tears at the end of the book. Since Morrie is similar to someone dearly close to my family, I felt like this story captured my attention like no other. It really makes you appreciate the little things, break out of this vicious cycle we live in and realize that there really is more to life.
B004LK5CEE|5.0|Originally I wasn't going to get this.  Though I have had a PS3 for a number of years I never bought a Blu-Ray because I switched over to digital downloads a while back and now having this one disc is another thing for me to keep track of and who knows maybe it would be worth it.  Why do I care about seeing a band movie in HD?<br />But I looked into it and read some reviews that really changed my mind.  I loved the original but it did feel like it was missing some stuff to make it really great.<br />This Bootleg Edition fixes that and makes the movie amazing.<br />Cleans up scenes and plot points for you to really understand how things developed.  More scenes on William feeling out of place with his peers in school.  There is an awkward shower scene that would make any feel sorry for the kid (but its still funny).  Expands a lot on Russell and Penny's story and Penny's story overall.  Also the small cameo that Jimmy Fallon got in the original edition is expanded so you like that character more.  One of the best added scenes was the expanded walk into Rolling Stones at the end.  Walking down the hallway with everyone shocked that William is so young.<br />Sadly they didn't add the Stairway to Heaven scene into the movie but I guess getting the rights was too much or a pain or something.<br /><br />Overall: If you thought the original was good you will love the extended edition and if you thought the original was missing stuff then watch this and you will discover why so many love this film.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I LIKED this game app pretty well. Worked well on my kindle fire he, no apparent glitches, or disconnects. Like the way the ho games were set up with the interactive actions . Would gladly recommend.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|This is a great reboot of Galaga, it even referenced it in the beginning. Good challenge, addicting, good graphics (and it still looks 8-bit). I recommend this app.
B0098XY5VK|4.0|Hello! Happy Holidays! I am sorry I haven't write a reveiw in a while, but please check out the logo game and temple run and Alarm Clock. Hope you will hang in there and always like my reveiws. I try very hard to make people enjoy them. This one is Hot Dog Bush. My dad loved this as a computer game and I like to play it except it is just the first level which is the Bronx. I would recommend playing it on a computer or an apple product. The graphics are the best on this one. Thank You for reading and keep on liking!<br />-Syd :)
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A dear friend of mine recommended this to me, and the story didn't disappoint me in the slightest. I watched the movie on the edge of my seat, and since I own it ... I think I'll be watching it again soon!
0425264386|5.0|I love good versus evil, suspense, excitement, action, and thrills. These equal 5 stars to me and \\"Die Trying\\" has all this written by an author, Lee Childs, who has the ability to write words that flow from the page into the reader's mind, bringing the reader right into the story.<br /><br />Even though this novel was written in 1998, it deals with issues out of today's headlines. Issues such as gun control, government's ever increasing control over the people, and some extreme groups breaking off on their own. This is about one group that is lead not by people like our founding fathers, but by a guy like Hitler.<br /><br /> Jack Reacher, retired now about 18 months from being a Major in the Army Military Police is still enjoying his new life as a wanderer seeing the country as a drifter. As he helps a woman to her car who has a crutch and heavy load of dry cleaning, Jack finds himself face to face with two men with handguns. This is the start of an adventure that I found hard to put down.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I loved this modern take on a classic.  I wish they would do some more modern rewrites of the classic authors.
B006O3MU96|4.0|Hi! Syd id back to writing reveiws. Wait for Christmastime because it is free! I like this and if you want a real version get it on apple. Thank you and keep thumbing me up!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was truly a gift. I loved it . It made depression so relatable. It dignified ,in an off beat way, the battle to be better.
0547884591|5.0|This was purchased for a gift - I saw the author on Channel 9 - he reduced a very difficult dish to four ingredients and a cooking pot that didn't even have to be cleaned - GENIUS!  My son loves lamb shank - and now he will be able to create this difficult dish at home ANYTIME he wants!  WOW!!!!
B003L77G8I|5.0|I've loved the whole series of Bones.  The cast has great chemistry together and the story lines are always intriguing.
B008B92U32|4.0|I love this app!! Has been alot of fun! I do wish though that you have the option seeing your saved photos without going back to the very start of the app. Fix that & I'd gladly give it 5 stars!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Sometimes it will loose the memory but if u tun off your device and turn it back on your memory will come back
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the period.  Grandmas are so entertaining.  The castle makes it fairytaleish and the drama makes it like everyday life.
B00170GXYO|5.0|This is my favorite comedy of all time.  I love Bill Murray.  I look forward to the upcoming project, which I hope Bill Murray decides to do.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Can use it to hook up my Kindle Fire to our laptop and its longer than the original charger cable too so that's really great!!
B009ZE27US|5.0|its fun but if u are like 13 years old it will give u like 40 something years old but<br />if u was paying money for this I wsay a waste of.money but I got it anyway Because its free
B00992CF6W|4.0|sadly I have not gotten updates earlier but that is also part of having a cheaper device than the Ipad but once u get the update u can't put ur kindle down
B00APUQT7I|4.0|This is a funny movie although not as good as the first one it is not bad. Good evening family movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It really kept you guessing on what was to come next. Very interesting<br /><br />Great Book!!!
B000QGEB12|5.0|enjoyed by several generations of my family, love the slapstick comedy that the US film makers can't seem to get right
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game. I love everything except that you have to wait for coins. I love this game. I love Justin bieber.
B007N9FKCY|4.0|The first few levels are pretty easy. But when you get to the last few levels they are SO hard. If you get frustrated easily I don't recommend it.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved these books!! Words can not describe how much. I am so lost now that I have read them. Nothing compares seems to compare
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|This is one of my husbands favorite movies, so when I saw it on Amazon a month before Christmas, I decided it would be a perfect gift. He was very excited to get it. Received package before estimated delivery date which was great with Christmas coming up.
B003VANOFY|4.0|The headset itself is pretty awesome, however I noticed considerable differences in sound quality between drivers (the latest at the time sounded like crap, but I did settle on some older ones). I'm not a huge fan of the mic playing back in my headset, but you can turn it off at least (if you run the software as an admin).
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Nice graphics, and requires a lot of thinking to beat it. but the game is a little short, wish it were longer.
B000683VI4|5.0|Excellent watch for people who love more real to life stories. Keep a box of tissues handy though...you are going to need them!  All the actors were wonderful in this movie.  Wish Hollywood would make more of this kind of stuff than all the other that's out there!  Life has many stories to be told!
B004U5WZG8|5.0|I wish more of her stuff was out there. She is so talented and has an amazing voice. I would like to see her live.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great for kids to pass the time. Excellent graphics, and easy to perform tasks, perfect for young kids! I enjoy it as well :)
B008LV8TSU|5.0|My wife and I read this book together and really enjoyed the fantasy of it all. We watched the movie later (which of course is very different) and definitely thought the book was better. Howl's antics are entertaining but no, he is not someone we'd want to be around. Will definitely be look at other Diana Wynne Jones books!
B00B7FXYJG|4.0|wonderful release of Batman , it was everything Kevin Smith said and more . If you hate this you should be punched in your fat turkey neck  :) .. it truely was a great movie watch part one first ..
B007PTJOV0|3.0|This game is fun to play ,it reminds me of Mario Brother's, it is a very addicting game to play.
B00992CF6W|2.0|Minecraft should be $200 it's that fun it you should buy this everybody should out<br /> five star I don't know how people do one star.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|I really like how on the Kindle that the notes don't get in the way but there is a lot of translation information available if you are interested. The notes at the beginning of the books seem fair and deal with some of the challenges of the text in a fair way. This is probably my favourite study Bible I've seen, and I'm not typically a fan of study Bibles, the reason being that I think it's too tempting to just look at what the &#34;experts&#34; have to say without thinking about the text yourself.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Once I started reading ,it was difficult to stop. I enjoy all of Clancy's books and with the Kindle app on my I Pad it is great not worrying about losing my stopping point and dog earring the pages or misplacing bookmarks. I can hardly wait for the next Clancy novel.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My opinion about this game is that it has a lot of action and I like all the action in subway surfer.everybody come try it out.subway surfer is the power of awesome.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is awesome the story is great my one complaint it had too many big words but as a man it was a good read learned a little bit on my way through
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I fly fairly frequently and now I know why I say a prayer before each and every flight!  Denzel never disappoints...deserves an Oscar!
B0026MOVO6|5.0|My Love Is Your Love is one of Whitney's best albums and I still play it regularly to this day. The album doesn't sound dated at all and Whitney is in great voice and trying out some fresh new styles. Long-time fans and those just discovering the \\"Voice\\" will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Track Breakdown<br /><br />1. It's Not Right But It's Okay  A+  Whitney sounds energized and sings with a new-found edge on this well-written track produced by Rodney Jerkins.<br />2. Heartbreak Hotel  A-  Whitney shows Faith Evans and Kelly Price how it's done!! A great song! My only suggestion would have been to<br />  incorporate the adlibs and guitar lines borrowed from the Jacksons' This Place Hotel she used in concert when<br />  singing this track.<br />3. My Love Is Your Love  A+  It took me a while to warm up to this track but I now consider it to be one of Whitney's best! Wyclef Jean wrote<br />  a beautiful song and Whitney truly shines on this reggae-inspired groove.<br />4. When You Believe  B+  My two favorite singers on the same track, written and produced by my favorite songwriter/producer - Kenny \\"Babyface\\"<br />  Edmonds! Why only a B+ rating? While Mariah Carey is clearly no slouch in the vocal department, Whitney clearly<br />  dominates this song in my opinion with her crystal clear, beautiful vocal performance. The lyrics to the song are<br />  somewhat trite and banal, but I guess that fits the inspirational theme Babyface went for. I would have loved to see<br />  these two ladies duet on an uptempo groove or an adult version of \\"The Boy Is Mine.\\"<br />5. If I Told You That  A+  Whitney sounds amazing and Rodney Jerkins provides a nice groove for her to sing over! Nice lyrics.<br />6. In My Business  C  Whitney and Missy Elliott collaborating on a track is an intriguing idea. I just wish Bobby Brown didn't come to mind<br />  every time I heard this song. A funky prelude to a theme she would revisit in much more depth on her 2002 Just<br />  Whitney albumregarding the scrutiny her personal life and marriage were under at this time.<br />7. I Learned From The Best  A+  A beautifully written song by Diane Warren, produced by David Foster and sung by Whitney! This is an amazing song<br />  which should have been a Number 1 hit! Whitney shows Celine, Mariah, and Toni who the \\"Voice\\" is on this song!<br />8. Oh Yes  B  This is definitely a unique song and more sensual than we are used to hearing from Whitney.<br />9. Get It Back  A  I love the groove of this song and Whitney just sounds great on this hip-hop inspired Rodney Jerkins track.<br />10. Until You Come Back  B  This one is definitely for fans from \\"The Bodyguard\\" days. An old-school style torch song with sweeping choruses and<br />  chances for Whitney to showcase her voice.<br />11. I Bow Out  A+  This should have been released as a single. Rodney Jerkins and Babyface collaborated on this track which showcased<br />  some of Whitney's most beautiful vocals on this album and charming, cleverly written lyrics.<br />12. You'll Never Stand Alone  B  My thoughts on this song are similar to When You Believe<br />13. I Was Made To Love Him  A+  Whitney does some of her best work on this Lauryn Hill produced remake of a Stevie Wonder classic. She redefines the<br />  song and shines on this track.
B008AIGWVA|4.0|I think Ben is way better than Tom.... He is a lot of fun to watch the kids are amazed by him. He reminds me of a pop pop in his chair....
B00A81MV3U|3.0|Post Oscars update: I'd like to thank The Academy for awarding best actress to Jennifer Lawrence, whose performance was outstanding, and also for recognizing the ultimately ordinary backbone of this film that sent the best picture prize to a different movie.<br /><br />The fawning of critics and the accompanying cavalcade of Oscar nominations set the bar high for seeing this movie near the end of its in-theater run. Then, as the credits rolled, I felt cheated. This is not a bad movie, but it's a movie that fell surprisingly short of the high expectations that come with critical acclaim and multi-category Oscar buzz. The crusty presence of Robert Di Niro and an intricately woven thread of football fandom don't fully conceal the chick flick at the gooey center of this movie.<br /><br />The comedy part of this \\"romcom\\" genre is adult, dark, farcical and football-centered enough to allow males to retain their man card if they watch this on anything other than a first date. But fellas, you have been warned (and this is in no way a spoiler): never forget the outcome of the movie hinges on the outcome of a ballroom dance contest. We've been here before so many times. \\"Flashdance\\" and \\"Dirty Dancing\\" are calling, and they want their endings back.<br /><br />As for all of the chatter about honest views of mental health problems: the mental health discussion is as superficial as the paen to NFL football fandom. This glossing over leaves us with something a little more gritty than most of its categorical kin. What remains is a movie about the under-appreciated underdog entrants in a dance contest.<br /><br />Not glossed over is in-your-face product placement. Post Raisin Bran (who knew cereal was a relationship signpost?), Apple hardware (so what's new?) and Seroquel (possibly a big screen first for a powerful anti-psychotic medication) get almost as much screen time as Di Niro. In the words of Liz Lemon: what the what?<br /><br />Good enough to pay full price at the theater? Yes.<br />Worth paying for a streaming view or DVD rental? Yes.<br />Oscar worthy? As Di Niro himself may have said in another role: \\"fugget about it\\".Yes.<br />Worth paying for a streaming view or DVD rental? Yes.<br />Oscar worthy? As Di Niro himself may have said in another role: \\"fugget about it\\".
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun game even for a grandma.  yes it is. just wish it hadn't crashed and lost my game. starting over. wah....
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i think it is for people who care about animals... i guess... i love it and i do care about most animals
0141345659|5.0|I chose five stars because it was shipped to me way in advance than the estimated time. Also this book was so amazing and I am really impressed.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|My Horse<br />I like the game but it keeps crashing and I have to reinstall multiple times.  Everytime I reinstall it it finds my account but it is time consuming to reinstall everytime.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|better graphics, new course, and the ability to respawn with the green jewel makes this game a very fun one
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|The orginal was significantly better. Throwing in a psychic partner and abandoning most of the storyline of the original was a mistake. The plot for this one was weak, the acting mediocre and the action forced.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Fine British series that absolutely fully engages my attention due to its fine moving story, excellent development of character, and British touches.  Found this series last year right before major surgery and it helped me through the discomfort of my home physical therapy!
B00000JTB2|5.0|My feeling is  it allowed me  hear these guys whom i never saw as they worked their show. Some of the things that you miss you can still have access to.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game plays just like temple run with improve graphics, update, and controls and also has a fun multiplayer section
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I thought this would be like temple run. Not very good graphics and boring after awhile but it is not. The game gets you to try and beat your friends on Facebook so it gets intense.
B000ICXQF6|3.0|After reading rave reviews I was excited to see this film.  I found it confusing.  It was like a jigsaw puzzle and it was up to me to figure it all out.  I guess I need the dumb downed version. :)
0780756908|2.0|This is an amazing book that you will remember forever.  I read the mass market paperback version in high school and I still have it.  I decided to re-read it (something I rarely do) and wanted a nice copy to keep, so I bought the hard cover \\"Centennial Edition.\\"  It's basically a mass market paperback with a stiff binding, cheap paper and tiny print.  It's much smaller than a typical hard cover, no dust jacket, and overall very cheaply made.<br /><br />I've read several Ayn Rand books and The Fountainhead is one of my favorites of all time, but the purpose of these reviews is to rate the product that you get from Amazon.  This product is poor.  I definitely recommend the book, but get a different version.
B0096DFBZQ|2.0|the graphics could be improved and this game is just a plain copy of the mario Kart games series of Nintendo
0385302320|3.0|I found this to be  repetitional, and draged out.But, I hope th next book is better. The irst book Outlander was excellent
B003PIUBZS|5.0|a fabulous..sexy...action packed, visually stimulating  tale...its got it all.<br /><br />spartacus pulls you in...and doesnt let you go very easily.....what fun!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This novel was recommended to me from a friend at the gym, one morning while we both laboring on the elliptical machines.  He told me that he was near the end of the book, but simply did not want to finish it.  I promptly downloaded the book, and could not put it down.  It was a hot fudge sundae every time.  Delicious characters with a study in devious, sociopath type behavior. A very good, fast modern day read.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Sharp, well-written, full of suspense. A warped and disturbing tale. I wanted a different ending or a sequel. Couldn't put it down.
0439023513|1.0|I was disappointed in this book.  The storyline dragged on, and there was no character development.  I loved the first 2 books, and couldn't put them down.  But it took a while for me to finish this one.  I would still recommend the series though.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is so much fun it is so much better than temple run it is even free get it now while it is free you will love thos game it is so addicting!!!!!! i love this GET IT ITS SO MUCH FUN
B006L1TT8G|5.0|i love this cd. every song is alsome. but my favorite are dna and wings. cant get enough of it.

B004DK5CW4|5.0|My teen age daughter and I went to the theatre to see this movie, and it was so good we just had to own the movie! I have gotten so I won't purchase a movie unless I give it five stars! This one gets five stars! We enjoy it every time we watch it! Great seller! This movie arrived quickly, in perfect condition!
B0027MJU00|4.0|After reading Gone Girl I couldn't wait to read Gillian Flynn's first two novels, this being the second one she has written.  This one came in third for me, Gone Girl being my favorite and Sharp Edges coming in second.  It took be a while to \\"warm up\\" to the plot.  The main character is definitely a very unlikeable person, though she has experienced terrible tragedy in her life.  There was a point where I thought, \\"do I really care what happens to any of these people?\\" (which is why I took away one star) But Gillian Flynn being the gifted writer that she is pulled me in and I was hooked.  You really don't like ANYONE in this book but you wind up empathsizing with the characters deep flaws and all.  There is graphic violence against people and animals which is disturbing but not gratuitous and is necessary to the plot.  Another page turner by this writer. I cannot wait for another book by Gillian Flynn!
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|This is an excellent CD I play it in the car on my way to and from work. I actually know all the words to the songs.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This is one of the very best animated Disney movies of all time (and we have seen most of them)...My 4 year old granddaughter has already watched it 5 times in two days...loved it everytime, and I have sat & watched it with her the whole time! Even the &#34;bonus&#34; material is good.
B005IQZB14|5.0|She was honest and open!  I could relate to many things she wrote!  Read it...you'll love it!  I need 3 more words!!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This wonderfully written suspense novel was dark, brutal and horrific in many ways.  Its portrayal of OCD was excruciating and you could feel the main character's pain.  Sometimes, the descriptions were repetitive, but, after all, that is how OCD terrorizes its victims.  I had to make myself put this book down before bed then couldn't fall asleep thinking about it, it was that disturbing.  If I were to take a half star away, it would be for the improbability of two things:  the physical abuse the victim endured yet she seemed to \\"bounce back\\" from  - which in reality was somewhat implausible and the danger she placed herself in in the second half of the book - even though the first half was about her total avoidance of not only danger but everyday life itself.  However, I loved this book and would recommend it to those who are not faint of heart or stomach.  There is a love story involved but this is not light reading so prepare to be thinking about this book long after you read it.
B009MO5G90|5.0|Es una película muy buena lo malo es que dura poco tiempo el 3d se ve super bien en compañia de un buen tv y blu ray
B003Y3GTU0|5.0|I love these sandals.  They have all the comfort of Crocs, but none of the cheesy look that sometimes comes along with the brand.  I generally wear a 7.5 in sandals, so I sized down to a 7 based on other reviews, and the fit was great.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|this is such a refreshing television series unlike the mindless, scum of American TV these days. Please give us more shows of this caliber to watch.
1595826971|4.0|This book is wonderful if you want to see copious amounts of conceptual art, and get an idea of how it was applied to the the actual game. There is a good amount of digital painted, sketch and photo manipulated work. If you love things dark and grungy, this is the right book. However, if you wanted a deeper collection on the design of Alice and her dresses, though this book does contain a lot, it might not be for you considering the book covers all aspects of the game from level design, character and monster design, items, and concepts of how movement and actions are performed. Also if you were more interested in the paper style cut scenes, there is a section about it, but it's not very large, and you're better off researching the scenes separately. If your looking for complete and finished artwork though, there's not a lot here either, and your better off looking online. Despite that though, this is a really good book for game designers and concept artists.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I enjoy seeing the series from the beginning and like the episodes very much, can watch when the time is best for me.  Will get third season when available.
145210655X|5.0|My nerdy husband loved this book.  It's super cute and a perfect stocking stuffer.  Would definitely recommend for any Star Wars fan.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I'm not a huge video game person but have found that I get obsessed with the hidden object games and this is certainly one to add to the list. Absolutely love it and the graphics are some of the best I've seen
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Loved it, thanks
B006AZZPCM|1.0|It worked great for the first 3 days, then it would freeze and do weird stuff and the songs that I downloaded would play sometimes and not play other times. Too bad, when it was working during the first 3 days, it was great. I would think most of the positive reviews here were written during the first few days of installing the app.
B004P2HMNM|5.0|I'm an adult LEGO fan but I purchased this for me and my teenage cousins to put together over the holiday. It can be a long process but in a group, it can actually be a fun build. There are two buildings, also, so you can split up the fun that way.<br /><br />I have four modulars: the Grand Emporium, Fire Brigrade, Town Hall and now the Pet Shop. When the Pet Shop first came out, I wasn't too keen on it because it seemed so small in comparison to the other modulars and it seemed a bit out of place. However, it was on sale during the holiday season so I decided to go for it. I don't know why I held out on this for so long. I think the Pet Shop is absolutely wonderful and creative. All the modulars have their own unique charm but I think the Pet Shop brings a lot of fun and cuteness to the block. It's very colorful without being gaudy. There are also a lot of details in the facade that are put together quite elegantly. In my opinion, if you were to only get one modular building, it would be the Pet Shop because it looks great by itself, it can be separated, and it makes a great street scene.<br /><br />The build process can be quite tedious for younger builders or for those who lack patience. I enjoyed the build but some of my younger cousins got a bit frustrated. In the end though, we all enjoyed the end product. Even the other adults came out to watch the build process and play with set. (Modular set building may become a holiday tradition for us!)<br /><br />Younger children may not enjoy the build but they may enjoy the end product (if you allow them to play with it). It's not really the best set as a play set as the rooms are pretty tiny and difficult to reach into. If you're looking for a playset, I suggest sets from LEGO City or the easier Lego Creator 3-in-1 houses.<br /><br />Highly recommended! As with all my LEGO reviews, check the MSRP on the LEGO website before you buy. If you buy from a third-party seller on Amazon or eBay, you will likely overpay. Research before you buy.rch before you buy.
B00683JK9K|4.0|so, it is a little difficult to fit the puzzle together on a space that's the same exact size as the puzzle itself, and I have a tendancy to put the pieces on top of one another.  nothing &quot;disappeared&quot; on me unless I hit the button to just show the edge pieces.  I think maybe some people don't know how to use a touch screen. my dad has difficulty with this app cuz he touches his other fingers to the screen when hes trying to drag the pieces to the layout.  he slid a couple off of the edge accidentally, but they showed up right back in his queue. I don't know, peeps who gave this one or two stars... I think that the problem might be you, not the app.
B00B0ZT9NI|4.0|Could have had a little more action, and less suspense. All in all it was a good buy. Glad I bought it.

B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is amazing.  it is not updated enough to catch up to the Pc or xbox but its getting there you can build virtually anything so five stars
B0060CV31C|5.0|This is one of our favorite cartoons! David Spade and John Goodman add great humor making it fun for kids and adults.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|I didn't enjoy this book.  I know it was all the rage and with the movie coming out, I wanted to read the book prior to seeing the movie.  I'm glad I did as it saved me $$ at the theater.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love the winning deals the most!!!  I also like the fact that it will show you how to win if you are stumped. A great game!!
B0014NDXGA|1.0|This rangefinder froze up with a range of 9999 yds after only using it for a month.  Bushnell customer service said that the computer was frozen and that they would send a return label to replace the item.  We tried for two weeks to get the return label and never got it.  Thank goodness Amazon would allow me to return the item.  I will not buy another Bushnell rangefinder.  The product is unreliable and the customer service (Bushnell, not Amazon) is terrible.
B003EYVXYG|1.0|So bad....<br /><br />I really didn't want to hate this movie. I watched it when it first came out and I was blinded by my love of Romero's original trilogy. I recently watched it a second time and I cannot believe how terrible this is.<br /><br />I honestly can't tell if this is Romero's version of a comedy. Every time the zombies appear it is shown as a joke. Every kill of a zombie is laughable (a fire extinguisher? Zombie fishing?). The zombies are not scary at all, and don't even frighten the characters. I do enjoy the characters of Sarge and O'Flynn, but every other character is a satire. There's a female soldier, a stereotypical lesbian, who is first seen masterbating in the passanger seat of a jeep out in the open air, for no apparent reason, in a setting that is anything but erotic and surrounded by her solder colleagues. Really?!?<br /><br />Skip this - watch The Walking Dead instead.<br /><br />As an interesting side note, Sarge and the kid are both in Land of the Dead, making this technically the third film by Romero to feature recurring characters.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Friends loved it. It was the first 3D for their new system. They just bought the new system and didn't have any thing to run on it.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Great workout tape!!  I highly recommend it.  Anything with Jillian Michaels, you know is going to be a fantastic, butt-kicking workout!!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game has been fun to play!!! Very worth downloading. Being a free game, one might think it's not worth downloading, but I assure you that it is fun and will provide you with entertainment!!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Andrea Bocelli could sing the phone book and he'd still be better than 99.9% of what passes for music and talent these days.  I love these critics - like your opinion matters, sheeeesh!!!!

0780631684|5.0|My husband loves the Final Destination Series so we just had to have this to add to the other movies in our collection. He is NOT a horror movie fan but surprisely really likes the Final Destination series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game i play it whenever i get a chance too.<br />I have actually told people to get it just for the compition lol<br />So get :) i have it for my kindle fire.

B0063GORYU|3.0|I love spider,but this version does not let you move around with ease.It seems a little stubborn. I am a little disappointed.
B0031RS2HC|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I had read all the other Reacher books but had somehow missed this one. I felt as though this book provided additional depth to the main character Jack Reacher.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I can usually figure out where an author is going no matter how enigmatic. I couldn't figure out a second of this. So good.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game! I can't put it down, unless my kindle has to charge. When I first got it, I just wanted to what it was l like. I ended up living it.
B00ANW33CM|2.0|Too slow! I like fast movers! Maybe I better stay with other Mahjong games. I removed it from my carousel!

B004X8W4A4|5.0|I loved this book, as well as the series (I've read all four).  Although the first book -HEAT WAVE- was a little slow at the beginning the others, including Naked Heat, were fast paced, exciting and entertaining.  A real good read.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great easy read...The kind of book to cuddle with that keeps your adrenalin pumping just enough. Thoroughly enjoyed it<br />Sole
B00000G3I2|5.0|Great movie for my generation. Someone my age, 63, knows these characters. We have seen all these people at on time or the other.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|This is an exciting &#34;edge of your seat&#34; series.  Continually has &#34;couldn't see that coming&#34; events occurring. Can't wait for the next season to begin.
B0091REZMW|5.0|great for people who like hidden games :) also if you like books like Waldo and suhlch its also a good game
B003ZLV8T8|4.0|Became a fan of Anne Hathaway and always enjoy Meryl Streep.  This was entertaining, but a chick flick.  Wouldn't watch it with my guy.  Love the clothes!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this show. Season 1 and season 3 are a little better than season 2, but I still have no complaints!
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Read my season 2 review.  It continues to be the same with each season.  The interaction of the characters is just as important as the story line for me.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Its a fun game to play. it helps you  need it I like it a lot you should get it!!!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Awesome book! Would definitely recommend to others to read. Love that Irons hating ads died! She deserved it for her false accusations!!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Love the show and the ease of access to this version.  However, as it plays on my iPad, each of them seems to stop for buffering several times throughout the episode.  Otherwise, it's great.
B005723JSQ|5.0|This is a very funny and entertaining book and it downloaded very fast.  I nada a good read and would recommend it to my friends.
B008J34466|3.0|I loved how I got this but it was a day late. I spent extra money for 2 day shipoing and got it late. It was late by 2 days and was supposed to be for my moms birthday
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I've always wanted to read Oz.  It is one of my favorite movies, wonderful theme of facing adversity and growing stronger through experiences.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I wanted to read the series before the movies came out. I was not disappointed with the read...i hope the movie does it some justice.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This is a great biography book and well researched material and it downloaded very fast. I would highly recommend it to my friends.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Suspenseful ,happy,sad &relatable. Awesome read!! Different than Sparks usual style. Really enjoyed it!! Captured me throughout and until the very end.
0062124293|4.0|Lots of insight into how 30 somethings think and live their lives. Don't miss it if you have been wondering.

B009CPE424|5.0|my kids loved this movie this is a movie that I would have my family watch all the time l
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is the third and last book (so far) of the Hunger Games. It picks up neatly where Catching Fire leaves off. What follows is finding out if the 13th District is real or fantasy. It gives you insight into the two most important men in her life and which one she will ultimately choose. Also there is her sister and her mother and what ultimately happens to them. A fine ending to an excellent story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Personally I think that its a great game. Good graphics and cute little characters. If you like Temple Run then you'll definitely love Subway Surfers!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|you need to get this it is a awesome game for kids for teems who cares get this app please
B003ODIZL6|1.0|It takes too long to find word. That is why I think they review only gets one star.you should not buy app.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I chose to read this book because I enjoy the Hunger Games immensely and Catching Fire was the second book in a series of three. It picks up after the first book but before the main characters tour the districts where they find they are a symbol in a rising rebellion against the Capitol. Leads you into the lives of the main characters, their thoughts and feeling about the districts and each other. Excellent reading.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game. great graphics I love the zip<br />line.  the game is much harder than the frist one.
0307956350|5.0|Not only is this a good story I can see this as a movie. I liked the intrigue and how women were portrayed as major players.
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|Cute graphics and easy to understand controls make this game a joy to play. Challenging achievements provide plenty of replay value. Unlike so many games this one keeps me coming back.
B0093LFXIG|5.0|A very entertaining text, it Make you laugh and let you see a little bit of the kind of life these boys have.
B000G0O5N2|3.0|This started off a little slow and then moves a break-neck action packed pace! The sound on this blu-ray (like most of Ridley Scotts other work) is nothing short of spectacular! Explosions and bullets whizzing throughout to keep you on the edge of your seat. This is really best enoyed on a solid 7.1 system. The picture quality was not the best i've ever seen but certainly nothing wrong with it. My only problem with the movie is that is does drag and after the 1000th straight explosion it gets a little old. The character development is also a little weak. War movies like Saving Private Ryan do much better in this regard. I would say it is worth seeing although it took me three separate viewings to finish it. I'm also not sure about the re-watchability of it as well. This seemed like a barrage of action with no real purpose or plot to hold it together. Three stars for the sound effects and effort it took to put it on the screen.
030758836X|5.0|Although I wanted to see the bad guy get their due the way I wanted to see it, I loved this story!
0765325950|2.0|This review contains no spoiler(well maybe a few ) but I must say I did not like this book. Other reviewers say that it was fast-paced but it is not. Rather it is an endless amount of stupid battles. I say stupid battles because this book just seems a bit \\"off\\" the characters behave like they are out of sync with how they have been portrayed in the other books. It does not help that much of the plot is driven by third-tier characters who all manage to be alive at the end of the book. While a MAJOR character is killed in an odd way that some say was great.  I see this death as a waste of time. It did not make me angry or sad it was just like okay we need someone to die lets pick someone who people on message boards don't like. No matter if this was forced to come about by negating PAGES of exposition and fore-shawdowing that had been building since book one.<br /><br />This book seems too rushed-I don't mean pacing it just seems thrown together as if some parts were a cut and paste of what RJ wanted but BS did not know how to properly execute what RJ wanted.<br /><br />So that's it for me no more re-reads of these books. Now that I know it ends in just a disjointed manner I will not be reading ANY of the these books again. Thanks for wasting about a month of my life all told in reading time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|just got my kindle and started playing this briefly after and now.... I'm addicted. the game I've been playing for two hours has got me hooked to my game and kindle. thank you subway surfer game. I love you.

B003EY7IRC|5.0|Had to go back and re-read the best parts. I must have devoured the words the first time through and needed to go back a second time to savour them.  I cant get these characters out of my head.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is an improvement from their last ones. This game does NOT make you buy stuff to prosper. Every 5 minutes there's no pop-up saying &quot;Oops! You need more gems to buy this, would you like to go to the store now?&quot;. Instead of buying all the stuff, you can just cross-breed your original, coin-payed, dragons. BTW, lookin' for neighbors, add me @ Rainbow_Dash_2_U. Thanks everyone!<br /><br />  ~Utada Yuki

B0009PAVI2|2.0|After some thorough research on various photo lens filter cases, I chose this one for several reasons:<br />1. I've bought Tamrac products in the past and have been very pleased with the quality and value;<br />2. It came in a pocket form factor rather than a wallet, which allowed it to fit inside my camera case; and<br />3. It was reasonably priced.<br /><br />Fifteen minutes after opening the package, it was back in its box and in my closet, never to see the light of day again. The product description states that it \\"provides quick access to three filters up to 77mm in size in separate, foam-padded slots\\"; yet I could not get my three 52mm filters to fit into the case. I could get one into rear slot easily, I could get one into the middle slot if I used a lot of force, but there was no way I could get the third filter into the front slot.<br /><br />So now I'm back to square one, in search of a good quality filter case that will fit in my camera bag.<br />Anyone have any suggestions?
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|if you are easily offended, dont watch this!! great show, you do need to watch the first season as each season is a different storyline!
B008LFY6NI|5.0|You paint on the paper while it SPINS! It is GREAT for children of ALL ages. I HIGHLY reccomend it for CREATIVE and SPONTANEOUS children who like to paint, draw, color, and use their IMAGINATIONS!  : )
B000JQUKKU|5.0|It is a classic. There is really nothing more to say than that. Read it if you want the original story.
B008S80PCE|5.0|I am a big Bill Withers fan, but only owned his greatest hits CD and a few tracks from iTunes. When I stumbled across this collection of all nine of his albums on the Sussex and Columbia labels for under $30, I was suspicious as all get out. We're talking less than $4 per CD! Yet several reviews of the set gave it glowing ratings, and with the Amazon guarantee behind me, I decided to take a chance.<br /><br />Despite shipping from the UK, the package arrived promptly, and after opening the package I was not disappointed. Not only is this boxed set well constructed, the remastered CDs sonically wonderful, but the forty-page booklet is a gem with well written commentary, detailed info on each track (musicians, etc.) and a nice surprise: a foreword by Mr. Withers himself.<br /><br />This set is one of the best boxed sets I've ever purchased (and I own more than fifty of them), and is easily the best bargain of any I've ever seen. Bill Withers has always been under-appreciated, it's nice to see his entire body of work so lovingly and beautifully compiled into this collection.

B0089EHWQE|4.0|This was a very well written story of dealing with a gradruplegic, his feelings of frustration and loss.  The caregiver faced some very real challenges, and learned to see beyond the man's disability to the person beneath the injury.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I enjoy these games that build cities.  Virtual City could have gotten a 5 stars rating, however I am giving it 3.<br />Virtual City seems more interested in getting me to advertise it on Facebook and getting me to buy the tools, such as game money and power, which are needed to play the game and I am constantly running out of. That lost them one star.<br />The other star is gone because the prices, power bolts and 70th things keep increasing each time property is bought.<br />If this is the future of their games then there games may not be in my future.
B0085LMFAE|2.0|This was a great album as well as video when it was originally released.<br />when I played this remastured version after purchasing the first thing I noticed was this is not nearly as good as the songs on my vhs video. I should have researched first and found a better sounding version.

B008AK8FHM|1.0|I think Dr. Alexander is a fraud.  I ordered this book by accident, and quickly returned it for a refund.  I don't think it deserves any stars and I don't believe he went to heaven.  The Bible is sufficient evidence.  Most of the books I have purchased from have been very good....the one is an exception.  Eugene Luttrell
B001N1DPDE|3.0|When ordering this knife, I knew that the nylon strap was junk, but I didn't know that it would be impossible to close.  The snaps on the nylon retaining strap do not close over the knife handle.  I was also disappointed by how dull the knife arrived.  I would probably recommend this knife to someone, but they should be prepared to make some mods and sharpen it up.
0887081770|3.0|My son saw this book at someone's home and loved reading it.  The book I saw at this person's home was a normal sized book.  So when I searched for it on Amazon and saw this, I bought it but was disappointed when it arrived.  The story is, of course, great but the size of this book is not.  It is tiny.  And this book has things that pop out and open, so when you put that in such a tiny sized book, it is very difficult to read and not as enjoyable as it should be.  The physical size of the book needs to be much larger.<br /><br />I would not have bought it had I known it was this tiny!
B007GFDVEE|5.0|I have to say this item is way overpriced for what it is. What happened to legos like they used to be when I was a kid. Now they charge you more for legos when you can only build one thing. Where is the imagination in this stuff. And we wonder why our kids are the way they are.

B002SSUQFG|3.0|Pros:  Perfect size watch for any man's wrist; extremely good appearance for any occasion; excellent band; accurate time-keeping.<br />Cons:  Needs constant winding!; hands do not match up to face-numbers appropriately (ie. at 0600 (or 1800) hours the hour hand is not directly on the &#34;6&#34;.<br /><br />If wearing this watch everyday for most of the day, this is an decent watch.  If, like me, you only wear a watch occasionally and have several watches (each for a different occasion), then you'll find this watch horribly annoying, hence the &#34;All or Nothing Watch&#34; title.  After winding it up based on instructions, it may go for four hours or it may go for ten hours.  None the less, even on the days you don't wear it, you still have to shake it every few hours.  Most likely, however, you'll get used to setting the clock...frequently.<br /><br />Overall, if you're just looking for a watch that has nice appearance, it's a good value around fifty U.S. dollars.<br /><br />Side-note:  I do love the band!...and the overall appearance.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One of the best shows on TV!!! I recommend this to all!!! Can't wait to watch it this coming Sunday on PBS!!!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I cannot wait for the next book! This series is my literary lifeblood. Great plot twists and character development. One of the best fantasy series of the 21st-century
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game so much but my mom and dad will not let me buy this game neather way I love it and my mom and dad said it can harm your tabalit Wichita ducks because I relly want to play it
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved this book! Couldn't  put it down! A touching love story of commitment and unselfishness.Well written by JoJo. Can't wait to read another one of her books!
0765325950|5.0|It's so difficult, in such huge series, to get the finale right. AMoL does just that, though. Every single character and loose-end is dealt with in a satisfying, if not always happy, way. For anyone who had trouble getting through some of the later books because of pace, getting to this book will make the effort worth it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I thought this was a very interesting read. fairly fast paced and all of the info that could be safely passed to the public. My hero's are not on American Idol. These guys are the real hero's.
B0027VTMAE|4.0|Any pairing of Roman Polanski and Lucifer is bound to evoke comparisons with 'Rosemary's Baby'. This current offering came along 30 years after that masterpiece, and while 'The Ninth Gate' is not up there with with Polanski's highest tier work, it's a good enough film combining rare books, European flair, and a sense of adventure. The overall feeling evoked during the first half reminds me of a sophisticated 'giallo' along the lines of Dario Argento's best work. Aside from the European flavor, there is a bevy of odd characters, with too much money and odd sexual appetites, combined with a few other shadowy figures. The overall look of the film leans towards late afternoon and twilight hours, which suit the plot perfectly.<br /><br />Johnny Depp plays New York based book dealer Dean Corso, who is commissioned by wealthy dealer Boris Balkan (Frank Langella), owner of one copy of an exotic manuscript(titled 'The Ninth Gate', naturally), to track down two remaining copies of this work. There are others, with their own agendas, who would also like to get their hands on the remaining manuscripts, which are located in Europe, and provide a setting for some great plot twists throughout Paris and the Iberian peninsula.  Mysterious deaths lead to a double climax, which offers fairly good resolution, but ultimately seems a bit contrived and over-the-top, although it does suggest that Dean Corso's inner soul might become the next portal to the Prince of Darkness.<br /><br />The acting is generally of high caliber, with Depp and Langella leading the pack. Supporting roles, especially the women, are nicely handled. Had this film been directed by a novice, or someone without Polanski's credentials, it might have served as a career booster. As it is, none of the thespians cut quite the distinctive path that Mia Farrow and Ruth Gordon did in 1968, when Lucifer's bambino came into the world.  Nonetheless, pour yourself a nice glass of Cabernet, watch the sun go down, and enjoy this movie for what it is.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray picture is nicely defined, but extras on the Blu-Ray disc are identical to the original issue, meaning brief interviews, and a worthwhile Polanski commentary.  If you upgrade (which I did), it will be for the picture quality only.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|Too much detail. Not enough action. I expected more action from a DeMille book.<br />I'm 80 percent through the book and still waitng for something thappen.
B009O07NBQ|5.0|No film set in Peter Jackson's Middle-Earth would be complete without Howard Shore's stirring strains, and the soundtrack to \\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\\" certainly measures up to the high standard set by Shore's music for the original Rings trilogy.<br /><br />Shore uses both traditional orchestration and exotic instruments to follow the action of the film and point out themes for individual characters. Two themes figure most prominently in the score: Bilbo's theme, first heard in \\"My Dear Frodo,\\" is a lovely evocation of the Shire theme from \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" reminding the listener of where Bilbo truly belongs. Thorin's theme, a haunting dirge which the dwarves sing about their homeland, is entirely new, and serves for this film the same function that \\"The Ring Goes South\\" did for \\"The Fellowship of the Ring,\\" illuminating the grand landscapes of Middle-Earth with a noble melody featuring french horns and high strings. Also note-worthy are the entrance of the Ring theme from LOTR at a crucial point in the film, and Azog's theme, which again features french horns. Unlike Thorin's theme, however, in this theme the horns take on a very ugly quality, loudly braying a line strongly reminiscent of Sauron and Mordor.<br /><br />Something ought to be said for Shore's tendency to end film scores on notes other than the tonic. Though it was more subtle in the soundtracks from the previous trilogy, the tendency is very pronounced in this new score, thus \\"A Good Omen\\" ends on the leading tone as Smaug's eye, in stunning 3D, glares out of the screen. The effect is one of incompleteness and irresolution, leaving the ear begging for a cadence.<br /><br />As a general rule, I don't stay in the cinema and listen to the music as the credits roll but, as in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, the music for these credits served to illuminate the story. Neil Finn's work on \\"Song of the Lonely Mountain\\" is admirable, presenting Thorin's theme again in expanded form, with lyrics that speak of the dwarves' yearning for their home and the treasure of their people, as well as their long-standing grudges against certain peoples and determination to carry out their quest.<br /><br />One final note (no pun intended): it is to be hoped that Howard Shore will continue his excellent work in \\"The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug.\\" I look forward to hearing both expansions of existing themes and new themes that are sure to be introduced this December.cs that speak of the dwarves' yearning for their home and the treasure of their people, as well as their long-standing grudges against certain peoples and determination to carry out their quest.<br /><br />One final note (no pun intended): it is to be hoped that Howard Shore will continue his excellent work in \\"The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug.\\" I look forward to hearing both expansions of existing themes and new themes that are sure to be introduced this December.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The series gets better each year. We have the first 2 seasons, and now 3 and we look forward to season 4. Great period drama, with a great cast and storyline.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This was the best! It's rare that a person goes through his/her day thinking about a show/movie that they've seen...I loved the characters, the twists, and the ending was great. I think season2 was way better than the first. Whoever did the screen writing for this show is clearly disturbed.....but thanks, you did an amazing job
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Superbe et excellente application, en plus en Français, je la recommande vivement car avec elle on sait exactement où la batterie en est. Design parfait, tout est bien écrit. Merci aux développeurs.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|Seems to work quite well grabbing videos to my Android device. I rarely use it but once in a while there is an education video that I grab to re-review.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|pretty fun. wish you had more options in the beginning for horses. I was worried I would need to buy gems with real money but I dont. probably the only true downside is how long it takes to get money in the game.
B00003CX9Q|4.0|Loved the movie and even though a used disc was still satisfied with my purchase and of course would do again!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this app so so so so so so so so so so so so much!  Very realistic game.  A must buy.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I am an Android and Windows/Programmer user who has never wanted to jump thru Steve Job's hoops to use Apple's devices. This book has given me a much greater appreciation of him.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Graphics are good very addictive game, would be better if gems were easier to get and things weren't expensive either
B00000DHR0|5.0|What a voice!  I have had this DVD for many years. My daughter enjoys Celion Dion as much as I do.  This DVD was purchased for her.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|There is a ton of interesting information in this book and it is incredibly easy to read. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B00AE2J93I|4.0|This is a good movie and very entertaining and very funny!  My kids enjoyed it although thought it was a little scary.
B0014KFV6I|5.0|I started listening to Carole King and James Taylor when I was about 16 years old.  I am now 60 years old. This album is timeless. Just Great.
0345803485|5.0|Had to read it like everyone else and it was good.  Glad that I read it so I could join in the conversations that were being held at work and with my friends.
B009GEAPYW|4.0|This is the best animated Batman movie! I really enjoyed from the story to the animation! Definitely a must see!
B002ZG997M|5.0|This is a terrific movie and quickly working its way into my top 10.  Denzel is great and the message this movie puts out, when understood by the end of the movie is truly moving.  Well worth the money.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|This book has a timely story, with a unique twist to it.  I couldn't put it down...as life was piling up around me!
0345803493|5.0|Had to read it like everyone else and it was good.  Glad that I read it so I could join in the conversations that were being held at work and with my friends.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|As expected - a great compilation from an awesome band.  If you like Fleetwood Mac, and don't want to buy their every album, this is a great choice.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|An easy to read history of a very different society. By following the lives of several North Koreans through an extremely challenging period, Demick creates a portrait of a repressive culture whose survivors have incredible stamina.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book is a great read.  Couldn't put it down. It shows what we are really capable of even if we start off on the wrong foot and<br />then find God.
0345803507|5.0|Had to read it like everyone else and it was good.  Glad that I read it so I could join in the conversations that were being held at work and with my friends.
B008RZF2I0|4.0|A really good album and the new singer holds up his end pretty well.  Overall, it's creative and has the distinctive Kamelot feel to it, but I'd rate it a small step below the band's best - the Black Halo.
B0000A36J1|5.0|Movie much better with all scenes left in. Helps one to understand why each person acted the way they did.
1401937268|5.0|I love these cards! They are so beautiful and accurate!! They have insane energy and I highly recommend them! They are my favorite deck ever'
B006ZDU7QI|4.0|But the songs are less catchy as the album goes on. Nice retro style that reminds me of Peter Gabriel
B008G12ERC|4.0|While it may not be as strong as some of their earlier efforts, it is still a good album if you like the band.  It has it's strong tracks and a few weaker ones, but the album does grow on you.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Like the story about the swan, most people only see the end of the operation.  This book tells about the work behind the scenes that made it possible.  It is intelligent, engaging and even funny in places.  It was also prophetic when it came to Obama getting a second term.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great turn pager!!!  Ending was a surprise.  I'd read again and again!  Highly recommend this trilogy.  Can't wait for movie
B009439HEY|5.0|Steve Hackett was clearly one of the main magical forces behind the sounds of Genesis and the songs selected for Revisited II provide an insight to his favorite selections of that era. Clearly awesome!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is amazing. Very well written and flows very nice. I laughed and cried throughout the entire book. You will be pulled into this book and not want to put it down.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is a phenomenal book, and gives a very good look at not just the usually-hidden spec ops missions, but also into the mind of an operator who performs those missions.  It has been said that the measure of a warrior is not how he does on a perfect mission, but how he performs on a mission where everything goes wrong.  If that is the true measure of a warrior, Luttrell is a true warrior.  And unlike some other accounts of missions in the war on terror, he also gives us glimpses into the mindset of the people we are forced to deal with - as both friends and enemies; sometimes both.  I have recommended this book to several people already, and will keep doing so.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This is a book for the intelligent.  Dr Alexander , as a brain surgeon, uses alot of medical terms that those with a high school education will have to go to the dictionary.  But, never the less, I found his book stimulating to read, and really made me think.  We all think about the here after and what it is going to be like and he gave us a different conception from the usual ones that we have heard about.  No beautiful field of flowers here. It is more like he drops in at the beginning of time.  At the finish of the book I was glad that he was able to write it all down,  that he seemed to make a complete recovery from his serious illness.  He had a remarkable family that sat by his bedside day and night until his return to them.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This 3rd volume didn't meet the standard of the first.  Very long and dragged out.....and getting more and more unbelievable as it went along.  I read the series because my grandchildren were reading it for school.....and I found that it is definitely written for young adults.
1451695195|4.0|I have read many NDE books and surprisingly enough, this one seems to have been written more for skeptical colleagues rather than simply laying out the story for the layman reader. It is fragmented in places and although parts are very compelling, it would have been more effective to simply tell the story and let it flow in it's purity rather than attempting to convince medical professionals of something most of them wouldn't believe anyway.
B003AVPV1O|5.0|Bought two of these to fix a situation with a pair of roving projectors.  Before, the projector would be moved with two full-length video cables because the monitor had to be looped through the projector due to the computer being used.  With this, the projector gets one cable, and the monitor plugs right into the other, so we eliminated one cable and shortened the one that is left.  For the money, a perfect solution.  And since the adaptor stays on the PC, we don't have to keep crawling under the desk to re-rig it when the projector moves.
B009CPES4I|4.0|Story line was great and the insight into India was super. I recommend this for anyone who likes a good story.
1419701533|5.0|My 7 year old grandson is in 2nd grade and although he's always been interested in reading books and his &#34;beginner reader&#34; books came easy for him, this is really the first big boy books/series that he's gotten into. He loves to read and was so excited to see the series of books rather than just 1 book.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is AMAZING. The first half of the book seems like just another (really) good contemporary romance novel, but then, surprise and surprise keeps getting thrown at you and you find yourself completely lost in the characters. I laughed, I cried, and I thought about my own life- not to sound super cheesy or anything, but it's true. I gave this book to my mom this morning and she's already half way through it! I truly couldn't put this book down. I'm pretty sure colleen Hoover just became one of my new favorite authors. :)
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Reading this book was a very enjoyable and insightful experience.  Not only does it tell the story of one of our war-fighters, but it also gives first-level insight into what is happening over there.  I recommend this book to everyone with an interest in such thing, and given that Chris Kyle was killed recently, I am recommending it even more in his memory.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|This was a really great read. I was worried it would feel like two different people competing for a voice in one book, but it flows so well you forget it's a collaboration and just enjoy the amazing story.
B00A6X9Z8E|5.0|She is one of my favorite power singers and this CD doesn't disappoint!  I love the new songs that are mixed with her classics; great for long drives!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My kids love this game and play if for hours it is one of the safer games out there for them to play.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Bought this for myself while buying the 11th Doctor's for my boyfriend. I adore the tenth doctor and David Tennant, this is definitely MY sonic.
0345803485|3.0|The author tells of sexual feelings by a girl meeting a guy and it goes on and on.  I haven't finished the book yet, but will not get the sequels to it. I bought it new.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|good movie; they just don't make them anymore; they make trash and those who want to argue********well, don't waste your time.
0618918248|5.0|I have been reading this book. It is such a great one. IF believers read it either they have to accept dawkins or be in 'state of denial' as they always do.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|Favorite movie ever. Of all time. Ever. In existence. Ever.<br />So of course when I got my boyfriend hooked I had to buy him this glorious two-disc special of it. Worth it. &#60;3
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. This is one of the best games of its kind. It makes you think, that's for sure
B0091REZMW|5.0|the game is a good one especially when the lights are off makes it fun. getting all the help with flashlights and others make it a good game
B0060D15AK|5.0|Love the actors, the premise and the scenery. Worth owning for those days you want to just be happy. Enjoy this non-guilty pleasure.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book has a great insight about how military personal have to continually turn on/off the war button! He very eloquently shows what it was like for him. This is mostly defiantly a great reed for military service members as well as people who want an insight about the reality of war.
B00BAHKQW4|5.0|I remember playing this style game growing up!!!  I love it.  It brings back so many memories of great old school RPG GAMES!  Better yet it holds true to that style of gameplay!  A must have game for all of us who remember the day when...
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I love Mr DeMille and the John Corey books, but we need to get away from the Mideastern terrorists for a while. The Lion was the best of all.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|Game went on my Kindle, but for some reason it won't let me play. It looked like a<br />good game for my grandkids, but if you can't play it. Lost my money on that one.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The mockingjay was the final of a 3 book series (Hunger Games) and I was saddened to realize there are no more to follow.  The book was well written and flowed smoothly from start to finish, just as the first 2.  Loved the book and am now working on a 5 book series by same author.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am a Downton Abbey fan , and this season is just as amazing as the previous ones, if I could I would give it 10 stars! !!
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|I really like the game but the bling cost way toooooo much n now I'm really geting aggiated because I should have at least 7 friends n its showing none; I don't understand why soo pleaseeeee fixx!!!!!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|MockingJay, written by Suzanne Collins was Imaginative and action-packed.  The ending was totally unexpected.  The story kept me interested from start to finish.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Outstanding Harry Bosch storyline, riveting.  One of those books you have a hard time not reading strait through.  After all those Harry Bosch stories, they never get stale.
145470246X|1.0|I have not words to make a good statement. This book supooses to be a present for my wife, but is so damaged that I have to request a cancelation.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I didn't think I would enjoy this book....once I started to read it....I couldn't put it down.... definitely not for the tenderhearted.....
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game, it's a lot like temple run only with cooler characters and hoverboards. I would suggest this game to anyone, you should play it. Peace out
B008X9Z37A|3.0|This is a stunningly beautiful Kindle cover. The near-pure black of the exterior and the equally deep black of the interior velvety lining are a perfect match to the Fire HD's own black. They look super-classy when matched together. The Blacktop gets a good hold of the tablet through its well designed leathery corner grips and the rough fabric finish of the exterior ignores fingerprints and is a pleasure to hold.<br /><br />The big problem... nothing holds this case closed. There's no rubber band or lock or magnet and this oversight alone makes an otherwise great case a not so good buy in my view. If Belkin devised some way other than 'gravity' of keeping the case closed this would have been a 5 stars on the strength of design and the quality of materials. But it wasn't meant to be that way.
075669812X|5.0|My boys just love to read it everyday. The only problem is, only one green ninja came out :):) It is hard to make kids happy!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I didn't think I would like this book....a friend suggested it...I couldn't put it down!!  I can't wait to start the next one.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This season is filled with the drama I have come to expect from this series.  My mother has been watching it with me and she was born in England pre-World War 2.  She has appreciated the view back to the generation before she was born.  Thank you.
0425263908|1.0|I have read a lot of Sylvia Day's novels and honestly if I didn't see her name on the book I would have never guessed she was the author. I think someone gave her an order to produce a Fifty Shades of Grey duplicate so she just cranked one out.  Not at all her usual quality of writing and story telling, although most of her books do include some pretty graphic sex scenes. Don't judge her on this series alone.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|A nice game...a little pricey in my opinion, but I'm willing to pay for quality.  The graphics are very well done.
B00AIQP9DE|1.0|Tried to buy full version screen went black I'm very disointed in g5 its not workng on my android tablet.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Put book 1 down and immediately dove into book 2.  I wish that this book would have caught my attention before 50 shades so that I didn't stumble and tumble my way through those 3 books getting to the end of the story. Cant wait for May and Book 3.  I preordered already!!
0062101897|5.0|My first thought on receiving this book was &#34;Wow, it's huge!&#34;  It was so much bigger, and so much thicker, than I had thought is was going to be.  My second thought was &#34;Wow, it's stunning!&#34;  This book is beautifully presented.  The colours and quality of the cover are amazing, as is the feel and quality and look of all the pages.  The book contains so much information about the people behind the movies, and the detailed processes that went into putting the eight films together.  The pictures are stunning, and include behind-the-scenes photos, design sketches, artist impressions, movie stills, and detailed water-marks.  In summary, I was blown away by the details, the depth of the information, and the overall quality.  Definitely the perfect piece for any fan, and a must have for any Potter collection.  Worth it at twice the price.
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|Typical &#34;blow up the bad guys&#34; movie. Action movies these days have gotten too predictable. This one, like others, lacks a good plot. You never really get attached to the characters, and like me, if you're husband saw the first movie, but you didn't, you get no information on who the characters are, or why some of them dislike one another. I found it had bad special effects, little plot, and was fairly boring.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game. It is very difficult when you get to the final levels; there are still four games I haven't been able to solve. I love the flow free concept of games. I have played the &#34;bridges&#34; version too and would love to have more free Flow Free games to play.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book is way better than 50 shades could even imagine being!  Not for the taboo scenes but for the actual story content! The literary style is on more of an &#34;avid readers&#34; level and not &#34;high school have to read for AR points&#34; level!!  A great read! Can't wait for book 3.
B00AG6Z92C|3.0|This is a disappointment. The choice of songs is excellent. Andrea's  voice is exquisite. His co stars (J Lo and Chris Botti) are flawless. But the arrangements and back up orchestra sound like an amateur night piano recital.. Reading the synopsis of each song you find that every one of them was arranged  by David Foster. He made every song  flavorless and low key. Like background music in a posh bar.<br />Listen to Romanza, where the music soared and actually made his voice ethereal.<br />Beloved Andrea, you have been sold a bill of goods getting involved with David Foster. You should have stuck with Mauro Malavasi, Joe Amorusa, Peppe Vesicchio and Celso Valli (Arrangers on Romanza).
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This Book was a fast, fun read. Just what I needed to get my mind off things before bed. Characters were good and believable, although could have been developed a little further.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I would recommend this game to anyone who likes this kind of game.<br />It is enjoyable for kids and adults alike
B00127RAJY|4.0|For only a twenty minute workout, this video definitely gets your heart rate up. I'm in decent shape - I don't work out all the time, but I bike commute to work most days (used to be 8 miles roundtrip, now its 20 miles), walk, and hike often. My heart rate definitely is up within the first few minutes of the video and some of my less used muscles are protesting quite a bit by the end. I did level 1 once and have been doing level 2 a few times a week. I haven't tried level 3 yet, but plan to soon. I like that there are 3 different workouts so you can switch it up and by using heavier weights you can make some of the exercises more difficult. The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because I think if you want to see more drastic results you probably need to do one of the longer videos. But I like that it is only 20 minutes since I don't usually have a lot of extra time and it gets in a little time working my abs, arms, and other trouble areas/less used muscles.
B004LWZW4M|4.0|I wondered if this would just be a more modern day retelling of the original movie where Caesar grows up in a circus and leads a group of \\"servant\\" apes in rebellion. I really loved the new storyline.<br /><br />What grabbed my attention were all the scenes that repeated Charlton Heston's experience in the first original movie that happened to Caesar in this movie. \\"Take your hands off me, you damn dirty ape\\" became \\"Take your hands off me, you damn dirty human\\". And on and on throughout the movie. For people who loved the original set of movies, this provided snippets of humor and deja-vu.<br /><br />The Making of .... seemed to indicate that the series will continue as they keep improving the computer graphics (now well beyond their Avatar work). The graphics were superbly life-like. You really saw all the apes as living animals.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is a fun tome for the whole family but on the resent update my husband lost 2monthes worth of things and had to start over on his kindel fire but my ipad was fine so not sure why but.rember the game is free
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Thanks for offering the newest season. I have netflix and it was not offered. decent price and excellent quality. Will use again.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This movie was good from start to finish this is a keeper. This is a movie the whole family can enjoy together.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love all the books. Thank you for the condition and delivery! I can not wait to watch part 2 of the movie!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft PE is basically fun.  If you have ever doodled or built with Lego's you will probably enjoy.  My kids are always playing<br />the PC version and they were always saying I would enjoy playing it.  They were right.
B008220BLG|5.0|I've seen the trailers and sort of blew it off like Twilught, though thae books have quality in their own right, I was uninerested. My birthday comes along, quiet and nice. My mother and I go out to the movies and she buys tickets to this movie. It was great!In part that I got the best seats (the place was nearly empty) So we're watching. and I find I like it, then loveit.Its funny and sweet,and makes you cringe, and think, and hope.  In a way, it's like twilight, but creepier. If you think you won't like it, try anyway, the book too is good
B00B2V66VS|5.0|there is only one glitch, and it is a big problem. the game is incredibly addicting. h h h h h h h h hbu
B00005V9IK|5.0|It's a great movie and I wanted to add it to my library!  Bill Pullman does some of his best work!
B00005N6KG|2.0|Ordered 2 of these headphones just weeks ago for use with iPod when working out and running. First one stopped working within days. Second one has been ok so far, but not a high quality product. At least it stays in the ears and on the head while running.
0345803507|5.0|I read all three. I got more out of the book than just the sex. it was a great love story and how you can sometimes meet a person who can completely change your life
B009O07NBQ|4.0|My only disappointment was that it didn't include the song, &#34;Break the Dishes, Crack the Plates.&#34;  If it had that, I would have given 5 stars.
B001EN71CW|5.0|What can I say, it looks great, the extras are great, and the remastered sound is great.  I'm very happy I stepped up from DVD to Blu-Ray for this one.
B004MMEF30|5.0|this was good copy, I enjoyed it. Smooth transaction, no problems at all, I will buy more in the future.
0345803485|5.0|the book was alittle out there, but a good read none the less. you couldnt wait to see what was goign to happen in book 2
B000I9VON0|5.0|Somewhat dated technology choices now, but the human story has amazing value.<br />Watch it!  Enjoy it!  You won't regret spending the time.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I finished this book in 2 sessions. Spool good. Couldn't put it down. :)<br />I really want to see the movie now.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My horse is a great game. it keeps me busy and interested. nice game to pass time with. everyone should try it.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Love this series so far.  The first one was better than this one, but I enjoyed it. I liked the addition of the character Liv, and how it opened up different possibilities for the story. My only complaint was that it was a little drawn out. I think the whole journey could have been cut a bit shorter and would have held my interest even more. I found myself skimming parts because it was dragging on a bit at parts. Other than that...I'm downloading the 3rd book now and can't wait to get started.
0765325950|5.0|Everything I hoped for in a wrapup of the series.  I expect to read the entire series again based on the solid storytelling in the first 4 and last 3 books in particular.
B002V092B0|4.0|I would have appreciated more insight into the goings on after a stroke, ups and downs, not a lot about the brain. The man in the street wants to know the nitty grityy of life after a stroke so that he can handle his spouse.
B007WEQ3K8|3.0|If your reflexes are not fast you will not advance on this app Was not satisfied for me. This may have not been intended for someone of my age to try to keep my brain active
B0087DIEGE|5.0|Short and sweet, you must own this for you XZ1 or XZ2. It makes a huge difference in the usability of either camera, and you never have to worry about the lens getting scratched, or where to put the lens cap. It's a bit pricy for what it is, I'll admit, but its well made and works well. Buy it.
B0047747A6|5.0|What can I say but it's a Great book.  I am a Diehard fan of Michael Jackson.  I have been since I was 4 when Thriller came out.  I read it allot.  I'd highly reccomend it for any True fan of Michael.  May I just say &#34;It's so Good It's BAD!!&#34;  I LOVE it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love the special effects.  My grandchildren also enjoy playing it. My 8 year old granddaughter can beat me so she really loves it!
B00881VLCE|5.0|If you love to put puzzles together then this is what you are looking for !Has three different number of pieces you want to do these in . THE CHOICE OF PUZZEL YOU CAN ADD to your collection is great. The pictures are so beautiful. Have gotten such good deal in PUZZEL logs. Have gotten several . With being able to use different peace sizes you can determine how long of time you wish to put into it. Just wish you could save your unfinished PUZZEL if UN able to finish it. But you have to start over if you would need to stop before finished. But would still highly recommend you to try this app. I Love it.
B00008OE4W|5.0|I purchased this because I had previousely owned it and lost it in a house fire.  I had to have it again because it is a great movie. The only thing I didn't like about it is the negative things about Republicans....but its brief.  There is only one bad word in it that I can remember.  It's exciting and funny!!
B001RP1G0U|5.0|I really like a good down to earth romantic relationship movie. This certainly fit the bill. I never even heard of the movie before and am so glad I watched it. Left me feeling very good and full of hope, relationship wise I mean. Oh, and i love dogs so that was a plus.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I love the music it suited the movie....I thank you for giving us music to always think back when we watched the Twilight Breaking Dawn movie.
B006P4FBUE|4.0|Like to be able to practice learning to play piano with this app. I HAS VERY good sound the grandkids like to play on it  also hope they will learn also . Thanks for having such useful apps as this one I Have down loaded other app which are not as good .
030758836X|2.0|I really liked this book and then the ending spoiled the entire experience.  I am actually in a bad mood because of the time I wasted resding this.  It was very suspensefull and then literally died during the last chapters.  Unless there is a sequel, don't bother reading this book.  Big disappointment!!  The author admtted that she got stuck at about 82% finished and had to have her editor's help.  She should have waited for a better idea or had a different editor.  Don't waste your time and money on this one!!
0312430000|5.0|The author, Atul Gawande, is an excellent writer, and this book demonstrates it fully. While it's main topic is focused on improving the process of surgery, it explains its aim by drawing on many examples from aviation, advanced, complex construction of very large buildings and other relevant areas where processes are too complex to be solved by having a single  authority on charge of everything. An exciting read that illuminates how simple methods can increase effectiveness in reducing accident risk. As interesting for a pilot as it is for a surgeon.
B0058W74UY|2.0|Does not work on kindle fire. Could not find any directions or c h at room to help. Would not recommend if you own a kindle.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Its a very addictive game, never thought it would be this fun. I reccomend this game to everyone. Also try the others as well.
B008VBYN80|4.0|wish it wood be easier to get neighbores.<br />and to send and receive gifts because that feature does not work right now but hoping they will fix it.
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|This game is fun for all ages. And increasingly challenging. A great buy for the money. Though I do wish you could save multiple players games, which is the only reason I am only giving it four stars.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this series. I hope the author chooses to write more. Reminds us don't judge someone we don't know fully.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is the best tv series that I have ever seen. I am not a big tv series guy but I can't get enough of this show.
1455853119|5.0|As a reader of Dan's previous books I can only recommend this book very highly. take the time to read or listen to this and his other books and lectures and your life will change!
B009EEFTMC|4.0|It's fun in a 3D sort of way! As much mahjong as I've played, this is certainly a nice variation. It's worth the $.99 just for a little entertainment and distraction. Thanks!
B009NG1FCY|4.0|I had read this book in my college days. That time it appeared only an erotica. I read it again now and noticed the sublime narrative of love as a love song!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is a great App. So much cheaper than buying a real alarm clock! Works great and its worth the download!
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Great movie, but I thought more would be done with the awesome actors doing the voices, I was a little disappointed with that aspect.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I love it.<br />The best thing is not the zombies, but the people interactions, especially the tensions between some of the characters. Well done by a group of very good actors.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|This is a horrific story but told in an amazing way. I was riveted by the story line. The author did a fantastic job keeoign the story moving forward despite the story line. It was probably one of the best reads in a year.
B003F5NSTW|4.0|As the story is told entirely from the mother's perspective you could imagine she is making the worst of every situation, but you'd wrong.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I own every season so far and I can only say that this show gets better and better as is goes on. I love it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Downloaded this game just on a whim, and was surprised that it was so good. The graphics are amazing and the game doesn't skip
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|O.K. this game is like 3x better than minecraft but...IT....NEEDS...MORE...TIME...!!! I was in the middle of building my house that WAS made out of iron and it WAS completely submerged into water!!! I mean, like seriously, really.... you can do better than this. ( sigh) ^~ ^ ( disappointed look)
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|I'm going to rate only this offering, not the movie itself. This particular package ships with THREE versions of the movie, in addition to special features.  I don't have a Blu-Ray player, so I needed the DVD version; the e-version (to watch the movie on a mobile device) was a GREAT bonus feature.  Worth the money, to be sure!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Everyone must read this fantastic story of struggle, survival and humility. It makes you see the world differently. would read again!
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|While the book did elicit a chuckle from time to time, I much prefer the humor of David Sedaris and Augusten Burroughs.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I use it daily and have had no issues with it thus far. It is good for planning your day.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitary is solitary and this game has all the standard options as well as stat tracking and high scores. The high score tracks moves, time and score which is nice. I am hooked on solitaire even though there are so many more advanced games out there. Sometimes simple is better.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Every time I thought I had this figured out, it would take another turn. This was a book I looked forward to reading and didn't mind that it would jump from past to present and back again. It was done in a very organized manner. I didn't want it to end!
B009DTI0IS|5.0|Another gift for Pearl Jam fan for his birthday.  He has not played item yet so exact comments not available.
B005V2S7FW|5.0|Need to generate random passwords and save them? This is the app for you. Works great and keeps me from losing accounts.
B000002J5K|4.0|This is not the best but it's good enough to get on my Ipod.  I love most of the songs.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|A wonderful story of a young girl who has survived the foster system.  But also, a wonderful education on the one meaning of each flower.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|A good read full of humor.  Occasionally interesting for picking up techniques but mainly a humorous perspective on what we as chefs deal with on a daily basis.
B0067Q42BY|1.0|I didn't like the app so I removed it.  It was not what I thought it was and there are a lot better apps out there.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|A little too much bio on the characters to wade through but a good story. Not the &#34;old&#34; Tom Clancy but still good.
B006CHML4I|4.0|great watch for a great price, glass back lets you see what's inside. This watch has all the essence of a watch 10 times it price. Can't complain.
B000000W71|5.0|Never heard of him so don't know how I got the album.  It is one of my favorites and play it over and over.
B0074VTHKM|4.0|This is a great read, just as was Kid Lawyer, keep it up John! I look forward to the next one.
B001T6PXFG|5.0|Great movie, although the streaming video did have some delays and one freeze up it was well worth watching it.
0765325950|4.0|It sort of pains me to give this just four stars, because it really seems to sell the novel short.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I liked the book - I might even say loved it - but it wasn't everything I had hoped it would be.<br /><br />It was satisfying, but it wasn't amazing. And as long as it was, it should have been longer. Too many characters got short-changed, and had somewhat rushed endings. It was great to see so many characters represented in this book, but because there were so many, it was difficult to feel like most of them had an appropriate amount of coverage.<br /><br />I suppose it's difficult to satisfy everyone's expectations - but while I feel like pretty much everything got resolved, because there was SO MUCH to resolve, each issue/character/idea received only brief coverage.<br /><br />It's still a wonderful book, though - and a satisfying ending to this series. Despite my sort of lukewarm words above, I would highly recommend the book - and the series - to anyone!
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|I didnt like the plot in this one. the villain was great and so was daniel craig but this was a different bond movie than ever before. the trailer was very misleading.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Book is interesting but too much medical terms It does confirm there is a heaven and things that happen in life you should pay more attention to
B000N2HBSO|4.0|I have read Sandburg's 6-volume classic, &#34;The Prairie Years&#34; and the &#34;War Years,&#34; and other reverential works on this great man.  But Goodwin's lengthy documentary biography throws a new light on him, a work that admires, without revering, a good man of great talent--and great ambition. Goodwin persuades us that Lincoln wanted to be great, wanted to be known for doing a great service, and self-consciously set out to be great, and of course, achieved greatness.  He shrewdly outmaneuvered his competitors for the presidential nomination of his party, partly because of their complacent underestimation of his abilities, but also because of his incessant behind the scenes political connection-building.  As president, he continued to outwit his enemies and  the &#34;friends&#34; in his cabinet who often undercut him.  He was, as Goodwin shows us, very, very shrewd.  I am glad I did not stop with Sandburg's Lincoln--with &#34;Team of Rivals&#34; I've gotten a much fuller, less hagiographic and therefore more real, picture of the man.
0765325950|5.0|I've been reading the series since the late 90s and finally getting an ending for it all was very satisfying. In the end if you're a fan of the series you should appreciate this last book as, in my humble opinion, it did exactly what it needed to. It wrapped up most storylines, ended the battle between light and dark, and left the future open to possibilities.
B004K4IZ54|4.0|The 3D in this movie is fantastic and so far second only to Avatar if not actually tied with it for clarity, sense of depth and lack of double images or ghosting/crosstalk. I own four or five other 3D movies including Kung Fu Panda 2, Alice In Wonderland and Lion King but neither of them present such a clean, clear and crisp 3D image as this movie and Avatar. In my experience, Avatar and Tron are the only two 3D movies that I've seen so far that do 3D the way it should be done and the overall experience is better for it. There may not be many (if any) pop out of the screen 3D effects but the pop out stuff is gimmicky anyway and when it is done, it's usually only to show off that particular effect and doesn't serve the story at all. I think Avatar and Tron got it right. This movie is a visual and audio  feast in 3D and 2D for that matter. My blu-ray player is an OPPO BDP-95 which outputs video to a Panasonic TC-P55VT30 (plasma with professional calibration by Kevin Miller) and my surround system consists of a Yamaha RX-V3800 AVR, Paradigm Studio 100 V.4 mains, Studio CC690 center channel, Bose 201 used as surrounds and an SVS SB13-Ultra subwoofer. Over this system, in 3D and 2D, this movie simply rocked and was a lot of fun to watch. The story line is kind of weak and some moments in the movie are corny and poorly acted but for an action/adventure movie of this kind (sci-fi), it's a blast.
0393061310|4.0|I've never been especially interested in early human history until I read this book. Jared Diamond's writing is easy to read and absolutely addictive after the first few pages. The way he tells the story of evolution of the humans makes you put everything you know about history in a completely different perspective. Even if you don't agree with some of the ideas in this book, they will at least give you an original view and make you challenge your own assumptions. On the other side, after 250 pages the books becomes a bit repetitive. Once in a while is good to remind the reader of an idea, but when you do it page after page its quit annoying. In any case, highly recomendable.
B00A1AD6ZU|5.0|Where will you find a mixture of secret societies, hidden symbols, ancient technology and a lost tribe of Israel? A James Rollins novel, of course. Rollins always does an outstanding job weaving together fact and fiction and Devil Colony is no exception. SIGMA is back, this time on the trail of what appears to be an ancient weapon of some sort, found by Native Americans and sought by the Founding Fathers. Painter Crowe receives a call that his niece has been involved in some sort of violent incident in Utah in which one person has been killed from an explosion. From there, Crowe is taken on a wild ride as he tries to discover what exactly caused the explosion and how it connects to odd natural events occurring around the globe. The story takes a startling number of turns and ends with an bang. This is a great book to pass the time on a long trip.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|not an enjoyable game, too hard for any of us to play to get very far in the game.  My grandchildren like the original game, but not this one
B005LAIGTG|5.0|This was an amazing story, because it was based on a true event.  The sweetness and staunchness of his love for his wife, even when she couldn't remember him at all was touching.  I think it would have been better without the nudity--more adaptable to younger audiences.
B004WR125O|5.0|pain in the butt, have to use separate flash drive for the firmware, but works fine.  (any one need a flash drive, I'll never use it again?)
B00632HWOG|4.0|The Yahoo app is pretty good, I can pull up my e-mail and respond when I need to.  I sell products and receive notifications on my e-mail, nice to know when I have a sale while I am reading.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I downloaded this book expecting to read a \\"King\\" version of history.  I didn't' know what more to expect, but was willing to take the ride.<br /><br />Let's be clear...this is neither historical NOR typical Stephen King.  It is a brilliant...BRILLIANT study of life, love, and the footprints we each make in life.<br /><br />Though I have always been a fan of SK, I now have a newfound love for his work. This book is amazing.
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|Sure, this game is fun and has nice graphics, but it force closes almost daily, and will randomly erase all of your progress, making you start at level 1 all over again. It's practically criminal to charge someone to advance in your game, just to go and delete all of their work. Fix these issues, and you could have a great game. Yea, good luck with that.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|the Facebook app is pretty good, I don't get the pictures most of the time but it still gets me the information I want to see
B008966SLM|5.0|Wonderful CD.. Love the second cut &#34;Worry&#34; best.. Great songs..  Not one bad song on the CD.. The band is as tight as ever with Cuz on bass and Robert Cray's guitar work seems like it is the best I have ever heard on this entire CD. This is a keeper.
B000OVLIQU|4.0|really good book with a lot of insight on the technical side of recording back in the day when 4 track was common. This author did miss out on some sessions and yet he did follow McCartney into his solo career, engineering for him and Wings, which I found interesting. A must read for the real Beatle fan.
B0050XFY4O|5.0|This movie is excellent. Very well filmed and acted.  Although the theme can be a daring one, I can see how the director has mostly spent attention to the analysis of the Love sentiment that unites the 2 main characters.
B007RP4D5Y|5.0|Great CD.. I saw them live not long ago and they were amazing.. Great band.. Antonio Sanchez uses lots of percussion, unique sounding cymbals, triangles, and great chops on the drums... One of my favorite drummers playing with one of my favorite guitarists...
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|The story starts out slow but then picks up and has a surprising ending.  Readers will not be disappointed! I couldn't figure out where the story line was going but I am so glad that I kept on reading.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|One of the greatest book in the series!!!!<br /><br />Definitely would recommend this amazing art of literature and I need 4  more words
030758836X|5.0|This book is amazing! It was a little boring at first, so it sat on my Kindle unread for a few weeks, but then I picked it back up to read again and I'm quite glad I did. After a show start, the book picks up pace rapidly. It's a real page turner with a HUGE twist. One I don't think anybody could see coming.<br /><br />If you love books, do yourself a favor. Read this one. You'll be glad you did.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Well-researched story of two pilots of good character and skill in an unlikely chain of events both at the early parts of their careers and at the end. I learned a lot about the air battles and the German high command and found it a fluid and well written book.
0984183523|4.0|It gives to you the rational approach to face case interviews.<br />This is a good ground where to add practical excercises and all the materials available on Vicotor's website.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great puzzle but needs new levels, I finish playing all the games in a couple of days(don't judge it was a weekend) and there is nothing left ;-( please add new levels.
B0076DELIG|3.0|A fast-paced murder mystery with some usual characters and their motivations.  The time element is the most engaging pa rt of the tale.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I love this game so much ! But whenever I download it, it only lets me open it once &amp; then when I ex out of it it force closes. It would be 5 stars if this problem was fixed.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I cannot think of a better book I've read - the writing is witty, and you can immediately picture the scene that its set in.  I look forward to more from Andy Weir, just hope he can keep up to the standard he's set himself
B00B2V66VS|5.0|no two ways about it: this is a fantastic endless runner game. graphics are great, new obstacles like mine, spike roller, and zip line.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game its like your actually owning your own horse. If your horse lover the get this game.NOW!!!
B0006Z2KXE|5.0|One of the all time greats.<br />Funny and charming, with great actors.<br />If you haven't seen it, you need to.
B002NHGG92|2.0|Enjoyed watching the episode on my kindle fire, but paying  $1.99 per episode is too expensive.  Will go to dept. store and buy each season.  Need to be frugal in this day and age.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the best book ever! This is the best I have read in years. It goes into so much detail.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My 6 year old daughter and I love this app. GRAPHICS are great, many activities and things to do to care for a horse. Super fun and in a way teaches kids that a lot goes in caring for a pet.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|I had no idea everyone else seemed to have read this in high school :-/  Guess my high school was a little behind the times!<br />I heard John Stewart mention it on the Daily show so I had to get it.  Great book, definitely recommend it.
0670023329|5.0|A must read for everyone. Makes you look at the world in a completely different way...Really just an incredible story.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Stay with  it and it will stay with you long after you finish the last page.<br />My favorite Stephen King so far.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Very thoughtful...political science study that is exciting and entertaining, too!  Liberals probably wouldn't like this too much though! Easy read - I couldn't wait to get to the next book.  Sorry there aren't any more!
B00APUYN0I|5.0|The entire cast pulls it all together with a believable chemistry that produces a highly entertaining movie.  No Oscars(TM) will be awarded for this movie as it is not the &#34;Oscar&#34;-style fare, however all performances are top-notch!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|This is a wonderful story line!  I really like reading it WHILE the movies are on HBO, too.  They are actually did an incredible job with the film - follows the book very closely so it makes it MORE enjoyable (which was a great shock to me)!
B00APUQH0W|5.0|The emotional tug of war between an estranged father and his daughter is brilliantly brought to the screen with the superior performances of the entire cast.  With mom, hot dogs, apple pie, and good old American baseball as the back-drop, you cannot go wrong!
B00A77II0U|4.0|i loved this game i wish it was longer the puzzles were pretty tuff i made it to the end then it froze brought me all the way to the beginning

B00B2V66VS|4.0|Fun and addicting game, a litte more difficult than the original but still very exciting. Takes a while to get used to how the road turns even though you dont have to move &quot;Guy Dangerous&quot;.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|This is a gentle story, beautifully and simply written. You take the journey with Harold and your feet fit into his uncomfortable shoes.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's very fun but it can be boring. I wish we could get the updates that the pc and xbox has.[...] Simple. But I would love it if it had Xbox and pc updates. I also wish we had other games that Xbox has. Like halo or some other games. More fun games. Or gta or something. I don't know. More fun games. More variety.
B003B02O14|2.0|I have always been a big fan of John Grisham.  Obviously some books are better than others, but I can't remember being this disappointed in an ending as much as I was this time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the best game ever if you love horses and want one, this is the game for YOU. I love this game soo much.it makes me feel like I have my own horse
B004WE01YA|5.0|This is one of our favorite Disney classics.  You can't beat these combo packs that include the download version and the DVD AND BluRay versions.
0765325950|5.0|I'm not ashamed to say that this book made me misty eyed in a few places. After 14 books, Brandon Sanderson has brought Mr. Jordan's series to a wonderful close that draws everything together perfectly. *minor spoiler* Along the way we lose some dear friends and see many others rise to the challenge set before them. *end spoiler* To say any more of the plot would be to do a great disservice to a wonderful book.<br /><br />If you've read any of the previous entries in the series, you owe it to yourself to read this book. You won't be sorry. I say this as a fan of the series who is not blind to its faults. Yes, the middle books dragged, and, yes, if had to read one more time that Nynaeve tugged on her braid I would have screamed out loud, but this book made it all worthwhile. Thank you Brandon, and thank you to Harriet for allowing this series to be brought to it's conclusion.<br /><br />My only regret is that I was unable to give Brandon and Harriet my money. I sorely wanted to pay for this book the day it came out but Harriet decided to delay the e-book release until April. I unfortunately don't have the space to store 900 page tomes when I can just carry them around on my kindle. Please reconsider this as I was ready and willing to pay for this book, and ended up having to check it out from the library instead.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I read this classic when I was a kid.  Now my kids have all read it.  Easy enough for a child to read and be entertained, yet it stretches their skills a bit.  It's also written well and has enough complexity to appeal to adults as too.  It's of the rare ilk that appeals to a wide audience with equal success.
B0048KXRR6|5.0|Nannie McPhee and Nannie McPhee Returns are wonderful for any age, Who doesn't enjoy a movie that everyone can watch together. Emma Thompson is superb as always.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|This book was both laugh out loud funny and also heartbreaking.  I could not put it down.  I would definitely recommend it to all my friends.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|This was a movie with a &#34;what will happen next&#34; tone, with a somewhat surprise ending, at least for me. I like to get &#34;lost&#34; in a movie and not try to second guess anything, so maybe some of you will know what is going to happen. Great performances by all of the cast, but especially by Denzel and by John Goodman.
B000YHC9WQ|5.0|Intense and as realistic as a movie can get on this type of subject<br />Edward Norton's performance is absolutely mesmerizing
B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of his best books. A real page turner. I would recommend this book to all Nicholas Sparks fans. !
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The story line made me want to keep reading and wouldn't let me put this novel down, it was a great read.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have been on a real science fiction kick lately and came upon this lovely little gem. All I have to say is wow, i was absolutely captivated the whole way through. I read this on my commute to and from work and found myself wishing my commute was longer so that i could squeeze in a few more pages. The worst part about this whole thing was that it ended so quickly (539 pages later). Highly recommend.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best!I can't stop playing it, it's soo fun!People think Temple Run is best NO WAY!!! Subway Surfers is the best. I say you should get this game, you won't regret it!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|In 19th Century France, Jean Valjean is a man who stole a piece of bread to feed his sister's baby. He is imprisoned for twenty years. Valjean is released, but he breaks parole, and is haunted by Javert, the ruthless policeman. Valjean agrees to care for factory worker Fantine's daughter, Cosette. This begins a remarkable journey for them all....\\"It is nothing to die. It is frightful not  to live(Victor Hugo)\\". An enormous, loud, wrenching tale set in revolution-torn France, \\"Les Miserables\\" is Tom Hooper's cinema-splendor, based on the 1980 musical that is still being performed in London today. \\"Les Miserables\\" packed houses on Broadway from 1987 to 2003, and came back in 2006. It is the third longest-running musical in Broadway history. Victor Hugo's 1862 novel has been the subject of some 60 film and TV adaptions. Two American versions in the 1930's and 1950's starred Frederic March and Charles Laughton. Raymond Bernard's 1934 French version, in two parts, lasts 4 1/2 hours, and is classic. This new \\"LM\\" stars Hollywood actors Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe(excellent) and Sacha Cohen(very funny), all singing for themselves. 25 minutes in, Anne Hathaway, as Fantine, delivers an up-close, one-take rendition of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\", a 4 1/2 minute song rich in power and tragedy; power in song that has rarely split the cinema; not ever so hardly in song.Hardly. Like Baz Luhrmann's great 2001 \\"Moulin Rouge\\", \\"LM\\" has sweeping musical set-pieces mounted in CGI, rotoscope, miniatures, and matte paintings; filmed in France, and London's Pinewood Studios. The DVD is glorious, a two-disc blue-ray release, with commentaries, Victor Hugo features, and production shorts. Long and sad, \\"LM\\" captures the genius of Victor Hugo, and along the way, it captures us all. \\"To love another person is to see the face of God(V. Hugo)\\".
B003JTHXOK|5.0|An amazing book. You never would've expected what happened in the end. Although I don't like how he ended it it was an amazing book. I couldn't take my eyes off of it! 5 star quality. I don't recommend if you're not a hopeless romantic! :p
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I enjoyed reading the whole series.  Over all a real good read.  There were times that I didn't want to put it done and it made me late for work.
143353083X|5.0|Great product.  Good investment.  I am very pleased with this product.  This Bible has a vast amount of study notes.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The pregnant pauses, the sidelong looks, the dowager countess are just a few of the reasons to enjoy this series.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|This is a great game and I enjoy building my aquarium with money I earn completing the levels.  It's a fun match game with beautiful graphics.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a really addicting game. Once you play it you are not going to stop playing it. Just a heads up!
B00B3MN65K|4.0|Love Josh Groban, but no recording is as good as Josh in concert! Enjoy that I can listen to him with my young adult children, too!
0743487486|4.0|I'll start by repeating my review title - this is not a parenting how-to book. If you've read any Alfie Kohn before, you'll recognize the style. This book is a thoughtful, research-based presentation of a parenting philosophy and a really thorough discussion of what is often wrong with current parenting styles and what could be done differently. It's thought-provoking and after reading it I immediately noticed that I was seeing interactions with my children through a different lense and that my own perception change was leading to a subtle change in my parenting - which, in turn, has led to many, many fewer &#34;drama moments&#34; with my toddler. My husband, who's more of an advice-book skeptic than I am, also really enjoyed this book and found it helpful.<br /><br />If you're looking for specific tips on how to handle problem behaviors, this is not the book you're looking for. If you want to think about how you parent and get some new ideas, it's a great choice, especially if you don't read it as gospel but as something to provoke thought and reflection.
B0040QYROK|3.0|Picture restoration is wonderful but the symphonic soundtrack is distracting. They should have also included the Georgio Moroder soundtrack from the earlier version.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its ok im not qonna say its qreat tho it helps me pass time dats about it honestly i wouldnt pay for it if i had to
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I think this game has helped my hand/eye coordination. It is fast paced and highly addictive. Frustrating too when you hit the rapids.  Have fun, I did!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One of those series that you can't wait for the next episode. Each episode ends with you hanging, dying to see the next.
B000FC11A6|5.0|one of my all-time favorite books - i re-read every couple of years. It's a huge book, and yet the incredible characters and deft interweaving of plot lines keeps me so engaged that i am always bummed when i get to the end of the book.
B001DDBCUA|5.0|Nice price and received quick for a &#34;Favorite Things&#34; party.  It is a favorite of mine and I want to share
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Love playing this game,  Looking to get on my desktop also so I can play it.  Have it on Kindle Fire and need to dowload onto my phone for when I am out
0761169253|5.0|One of the pieces of advice within the book talks about how art is often about what we choose to leave out (in addition to what we've put into it). I'll follow suit with this review, since there are already a ton of other positive reviews.<br /><br />By the way, I've noticed that particular tidbit myself before I ever read the book. Being a music lover and a musician, I'm keenly aware of the sublime moments when a song omits something the very moment my brain is expecting it. It tickles me. Does that mean I loathe the book for telling me something I already know?<br /><br />Of course not, especially since Austin takes that concept and expands on it, giving examples, quotes, and even artwork that ties it all together. If you're actively reading this book, it's likely going to engage your creative sensibilities even when you're already aware of what it's telling you - unless, I suppose, you're a hopelessly dull person. I love checking the 1-, 2-, and 3-star reviews of books before I read them as they tend to be a pretty good litmus test (and there are far fewer of them to read through, for the good books anyway). They either tend to be ridiculously biased or spot-on. Needless to say, in this case I find the 1-star reviews pretty laughable.<br /><br />\\"Nothing original.\\" \\"Mostly blank pages.\\" \\"If you were to take out all the garbage then format the writing like a normal book, this book would end up being about 5 to 10 pages long.\\" \\"More uninformed young people being advised to be lazy, don't actually do anything real, and just sample.\\"<br /><br />I hate to be crass, but these people are clearly buffoons who have missed the point. I wonder, did they actually read it? No, the information isn't Earth-shattering, but it's also \\"obvious after the fact,\\" the kind of stuff you think you know but conveniently forgot while working on that last project that gave you fits. The genius of it is that it can apply to almost anything, and sure, a lot of these lessons are learned withage, but Mr. Kleon here is doing you a favor by giving them to you instead of leaving you to figure them out for yourself. Read the first 5 pages and you'll get a good idea of what the book is like. If you can't get anything out of it, then don't buy it. If you're looking for ideas for how to become creative, or even just a quick read to prime your latent creativity, then this works pretty well. I love the short format; it's easy to reference. I think reading a couple random pages each day would not only help keep me creative, but help keep these pieces of advice in mind, these life lessons that are oh-so \\"obvious\\" and yet so easy to forget.<br /><br />Edit: I thought for a few minutes between giving this 4 stars or 5. I think because it's less than ten bucks, it's pretty easily worth buying if you're the creative type. There are a lot of worse ways to spend ten bucks than this book.
B000FC146C|5.0|This book was delivered to my mother's kindle in good speed and she is looking forward to reading it again and again.
B004SBX112|4.0|Our family loves to play Angry Birds when in need of some playful downtime.  This version seems a little harder than the others, but it keeps us interested and trying to beat the levels!  Fun graphics!
B007WOA1IS|5.0|I'm reading the guide from my recently acquired Kindle Paperwhite. Crossed Feelings, indeed !!!.<br /><br />1) Let's start from the Guide (the  easiest part) itself (the information):<br /><br />Brillant !!!.  I've purchased my first Lonely Planet (Mediterranean Sea) in 1994, and tried in parallel some others. The fact is that my taste for tourism is perfectly enlightened by the amazing LP Guides. I tried the German version, living in Germany, and the French version, living in France. I did also experienced Scandi and Croatian ones... and the UK¨s. Just to avoid wasting the reader's time :  LP excels in reaching a perfect balance of information required for us, Tourists / Urban Explorers, to deploy with the whole \\"intelligence package\\" in hand, to avoid any disgusting surprise, while encouraging the reader to jump the fence and further explore. Top \\"tens\\" are really top, and the information is totally true.  The London version is consistent with all said.<br /><br />2) Now, as the very same LP would go : The Practicalities. That's to say : reading from my Kindle Paperwhite.<br /><br />Well... my answer is :  lot's of battery life. almost no weight and no bulk, and quick navigation thru the text.<br />By the way, you also have the chance of sharing  Kindle's memmory with the book(s) you read for pleasure, and the papers you use for work (.pdf s)  in the very same feather-weight device. Off course I'm missing the colour dimension...quite much, but... once again: lot's of battery life, and so on.<br /><br />Yes, I love the kindle version of the guide (5 stars given) because even colourless, I can take it in my Crumpler Cupcake's front flap-pocket, and enjoy the absence of the paperweight either to travel light or replacing it with some more glass.<br /><br />Helpful, precise, concise and well organized information, in a very practical package.<br /><br />Thanks LP !!!<br /><br />p.s.: Just one more. Either If you're the \\"Navigation / Operations Officer\\" of your Familyor a Lonely Ranger,  remember you may be reading once again the plan while the crew is sleeping or driving at night. Enjoy the paperwhite and keep the \\"bridge\\" safe while dark, and yourself.<br /><br />p.s.2: Sorry..., one more: these guide is not static. Add WiFi to the excelent \\"Kindle+LP\\" product and your boundaries are just un-limited.
B0094HRA6M|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas present for my step-son who absolutely loved Season One and couldn't wait for the next season.  I watched the show, too and it's awesome.  Definitely worth it for a big-time fan.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Aside from it freezing up occasionally and needing to restart the app, I am happy with how it works on my kindle fire.
B002ZG9774|5.0|I loved the movie, however, the disc itself froze up twice and had to be restarted and searched for the freezing point in order to continue. I'm sure it was just this particular disc, so please enjoy the movie if you should buy. It has the same tempo as Chicago. Great music. Who knew Christina Aguliera had such a great voice.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun but kindle fire users be careful its kind of glitchy but still playable. I was close to buying the Rio girl but then when I went on to play it I had to start all over and I was so mad that I blamed my brother since he was using my kindle. So anyone out there that owns a kindle fire have fun but be careful.
B004I744AS|5.0|Easy, handy, fun, and nifty links too. I love words and really appreciate this app. I use this app first when I have a question, and go to it for word games.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Jodi has this way of reaching deep into the minds and hearts of her characters, she draws a connection, and those individuals come alive before the reader! Without cliche or vulgarity she touches on senstive issues of teen sexuality and presents an indepth look at the frightening power of first love. The thing is, as you read through The Pact, or any novel by Picoult, you have to be prepared to leave your reality for a set time, and to deal with emotions and issues that perhaps are too relatable. She really is that good of a writer!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Deserves  all five stars<br /><br />Mitch. Rapp and Lee child's Jack  Reacher are the top of my list  of current heroes<br /><br />Mitch Rapp or  Jack  TeAcher
B000SLP4SE|4.0|even this movie was an older one I had not seen it and I found it to be entertaining and enjoyable
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think it is very addictive and it is really fun playing but however I think the person who designed it copied temple run but only changed the graphics. Overall 7 out of 10!!!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|i love this game but it keeps on crashing<br />it stopped opening after a few games....<br />plz fix this problem
B006AZZPCM|5.0|It works like it is supposed to. Easy to use and does not take up much of my memory. Thanks
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|So real, so relevant, so potentially factual that it made me think twice about my own cyber protection.  Could this be the warfare that compromises our infrastructure?
B007L6VR12|5.0|Thanks to a unique story and some strong performaces by Bruce Willis and Ed Norton, this is a movie that will become a classic some day. Everyone over 12 should see it.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|If you like action, love, and any of the other superhero movies you will like this one.  A MUST WATCH!
B003Y74KCK|2.0|I am always a big fan of Amazon basics products. They always provide excellent value for money. This time, they disappointed. This product is of so low quality, I think Amazon shouldn't even sell this.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This was actually pretty funny at times.  With all the action it made for a really great movie to see.  A MUST WATCH!
B005K17RU0|1.0|This app bugs out all the time, and is very rarely correct. I have it set to show the temp all the time on my phone, and it never shows it. If i try to access the application, it usually bugs out my phone and resets.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I enjoy this game.  Can't get very far but it sure is fun trying.  I guess it takes more skill.  I will keep practicing!
B003QSHIPS|5.0|I bought this LP for the music, but the artwork inside is marvelous, itself is worth the price of the vinyl.
006091307X|4.0|I read this book on a recommendation. It is very dense and I went through it once and feel like I missed a lot of the book. If you are into deep books, you should consider this one.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|My son loved this movie. I wouldn't let him watch it until he read the book....which he loved too! Would definitely recommend this movie.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I downloaded and use this on my Kindle Fire.  It is easy to use and makes finding all my files much easier.
B00280LYIC|5.0|My 10 yr old son has finally found a series that has really captured his attention! He loves reading now!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It's digital and up to date on every feature and you can pick your own noise and its so loud it wakes you up when ever you set the time for its amazing.
0810989956|5.0|my boys enjoy reading the dairy of a wimpy kid chapter books. the do it yourself book is great because kids get to write and draw fun things as well.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I enjoyed Season 3 with lots of serious thought, and plenty of research.  I love anything of the past and of the days of overspending and the privilege of certain folks.  Sounds like our government and its great spenders.  Having 12 staff members who know how to properly deliver a service well done is a joy to watch.  It would be a great USA if we had people who  did their crafts and products the way the servants did on this show.  You can learn a lot about people and how they are raised and what type of character traits they value by watching this show.  Although I think that measuring the layout of the dinnerware and keeping things daily cleaned and spit shined are of the past.  During the Edwardian era, money was easy to get through marriages (mostly the female brought in the funds and lost her ability to regain them in the UK in the day if the husband passed).  It was a job just to eat breakfast in bed and then take walk around the English gardens.  A true treat and I have all three seasons and am waiting for the next release.
B000WMEAKC|5.0|I love this album the songs are great and have really good meanings, this group is just a pleasure to listen to.
B00007GZR5|4.0|An outstanding movie, but one you need to watch several times to understand the subtlities of the characters. The cinematography was outstanding.
B002SEW5WW|5.0|I love this album the songs are great and have really good meanings, this group is just a pleasure to listen to.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have been playing this game for a super long time.I rate it as a amazing game.It keeps my 2year old brother busy for hours.he doesn't want to stop playing it.when it is bed time sometimes he has to take it with him because of this game.it is the best game ever.
B0054W4JQK|4.0|I really liked this book and read it quite quickly. The only let down was the ending, it seemed to be wrapped up very quickly and almost predictably.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|Great product, on time, I am 100% happy with this purchase, I highly recommend. Have not had any problems at all.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|This book has become one of my all time favourites. It was unpredictable with lots of suspense. I read it in one sitting. If you like a modern thriller this one's for you.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|I think this cartoon is cute and funny and i love it. Very entertaining for kids or adults. I defiantly recommend it.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|Audrey Hepburn is an icon and my favorite actress. I want her entire collection! I now have 4 DVD's. Thank you!
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I am a fun of Twilight Saga so I had to have this in my collection. I think the books are amazing and the movie is amazing is well.
B0026WNGBA|5.0|This was recommended to me by a friend who is a triathlete and competes in Iron Man competitions. I am new to running but a regular practitioner of yoga and meditation, and this book covers a lot of common ground. It makes intuitive sense. My only regret is that I got it on Kindle rather than as a paperback, since it would make a better reference that way.
B0079R8KXG|4.0|It is sturdy and easy to use.  Although I cannot figure out how to make it stand up when it is open.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|this gqme is awesome. it has amazing graphics.  it may be the best game for the kindle fire! i would recomend this game for anyone who lonlves fighting games.
B007UWBQEU|5.0|I Love this CD, awesome car music played it to Vegas seem fitting in some ways. I wish some people would just blow away.
159420411X|5.0|There is so much information in this book, it is hard to put down.  Even scarier is the truth behind the details about the housing debacle.  So few in such control with absolutely no regard for others.
B002CNOA6S|5.0|Great movie!! Rain man really captures the developmental disability, autism. I enjoyed seeing the bond grow between Tom cruises and Dustin Hoffmans character. Well done!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Its fun and very addicting so when I t ends your going to wish you had a sequel but of course there is not a sequel
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Never a boring time. Graphics are pretty good  and the horse options are thorough. Download this app if you like silly games like this
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is the best game I have ever played and it is a little like temple run but different everything.
B00127RAJY|5.0|If you are willing to commit to doing this workout, you WILL see results. I have done this challenge twice and plan on doing it again soon. But here's a secret - I didn't do it in 30 days. It took me longer because I only did it 3-4 days a week. The other days of the week I walked and jogged. The important thing is that you're adding variety to your exercise routine. I completed 30 sessions, just not all on back-to-back days. Jillian would probably holler up in my face for saying this, but if doing 30 Day Shred over 30 non back-to-back sessions (but no less often than every other day) is a more realistic goal for you, I say do it that way.<br /><br />My favorite thing about this workout is that on the first day, 30 seconds of jumping jacks may about kill you. But on workout 6 or 7, you notice it's getting better. Near the end of the challenge, 30 second of cardio isn't a picnic, but feels GREAT.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoyed this game...my daughter got into it too...it got me thru some down time:).....I enjoyed the BONUS too....I didn't notice it till waay later..lol
0517220784|4.0|Wonderful to have all the stories together; sadly, there are some typos, and a few of the pages are so very faint, it looks like they almost ran out of ink.  Not an issue for me, but the print is small.
B008QTV3X0|4.0|Intrigue and tension. Very well acted. Claire Danes does a very believeable job. Plot is realistic. You can't guess what is going to happen next.
B005DZMODI|5.0|Yet another CD to add to my collection. He is a master and so wonderful to listen to. Was fortunate to see him live three times...I Loved it.
B000QCTNIW|5.0|Not what we were taught about the brain 50+ years ago!  So exciting and encouraging.  This was a book club choice for me, or I probably would not have read it.  SO glad I did!
B0055V6EZE|4.0|After being a HOUSE fan for years just had to get this
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is Jeff Kennedy best book yet I mean a Valentine's dance and Greg actually got a date!! I recommend the book
B009DT9ANW|5.0|I know awesome is overused... but not by me. Peter Frampton's performance is amazing. Not only did it meet my expectations, it surppassed it with the newer songs, but more for the Humble Pie songs. The video is amazing. Other directors, please take note how this was shot. Timely, good editing, good distance, good closeups.<br /><br />The audio was phenomenal. I highly recommend this as a buy.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|It does not get better than this. Avast is reliable and proven. Set it and forget it, you are protected.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|I read the Icewind Dale Trilogy before this book and I was glad I did so.  This book was amazing.  I thought the books of Icewind were good...this tore it up!  I could not put this down.  Starting book II immediately.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|also have this app on my ipad. works completely fine. on my kindle, i can play it a couple times, then crashes. please fix
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I play the game for hour go back to n discovery that I lost all my money and trophy the game start from the beginning
B000089RV6|5.0|Great CD.  perfect classic rock.  a must for every collection. plays perfectly and as always im rockin out to ac dc!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Wow I am blown away this game is amazing you have to get it it's free if YOU don't like it then you can get rid of it
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I didn't like Temple Run, but heard TR2 was much more fun. to my surprise, I love it! It's more difficult, but that makes it so much better. I love being able to swing on the ropes and jump over the water and spikes. it's incredibly fun. 5 stars!
B008YU0AOE|5.0|And very easy to use. Quite convenient as the Kindle fire doesn't come with a calculator and I never leave home without my Kindle
B00992CF6W|5.0|get this app if u don't u r silly it is the best app so I highly recomend this app
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I loved game 1 so much that I want my mom to buy it. so she is. she cant wait for the 3rd!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|It was mind boggling how this app basically copied the entire interface of my computer desktop onto my tablet. It was convenient to use stuff on my laptop that wasn't on my tablet,certain files,documents..etc.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|There was a lot going on in the last few episodes..  I wonder if they could have done a better job with the ending.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i' ll probably delete temple run 1 this one is so good<br />way more effects and less glitches. forget the old one. but in temple run 3 there should be more variety of landscapes.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great Bible and I love the fact that it has the different versions.  It's a great Bible to have in your collection.
1451695195|5.0|This is a book that I would read over more than once.  All the tech information and medical based words were hard to understand, but context was great.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my husband and he has thanked me over and over for it  . He loves being able to watch it whenever he wants.
B008BGNMZU|4.0|does not disappoint.easy listening, clear, very well mastered, would purchase anything from fourplay, puts sunshine in anyone's day.  look forward to the next project.
B0017HMF6W|5.0|Hitchcock at his best. I believe this is one if not the best of his films.The quality is superb. great buy!
B006TTC5O0|5.0|Love jimmy Stewart & this is one of my favorites. My children & grandchildren have had imaginary friends & I love how the imagination is used. It's an awesome movie!
B004SUDPWI|5.0|The reproduction was very good. Sound was also. This is one of the classical films eve made. I recommend it.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I liked the way Connelly wove a modern day thriller with roots in the '92 LA riots. I think the plot is clever and shows the effects of war on the home populace.
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|Why is there not more creativity like this in apps?  Everything is perfect. Just perfect. Simple game of hopping between planets while trying to escape the bad guy at the bottom. It can be totally chill and fun but also, challenging.
B004GYY714|2.0|This app is pretty odd. I don't use it. I use I heart radio instead. I don't like the way it is set up.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's so cool because you can tap two times and get a skate boars and ride on them . Also you get to jump a lot.next you can roll under things too.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app. I use it every day. I don't even watch the weather on the news anymore.  I can see current conditions and the forecast. It's great!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|its good you can put multiple alarms set it for certain days put whatever music or preview downloaded podcast you want to wake up to and it will tell you much time is left till it goes off when you set it so you don't mix up am/pm. do it
B000JK8OYU|5.0|If you like cirque du soliel and the Beatles you will surely love this CD. It's the Beatles songs that go with the Vegas show LOVE
B001PP9ALY|5.0|Has a proper story with a good twist. Action sequences are so cool. In short,I enjoyed the movie very well.
0307352153|5.0|I loved this book! I seem to be surrounded by intoverts (my husband, my daughter, many of my close friends) and this book taught me how to better understand how they view social situations, and to better treasure them for the great listeners and keen observers that they are.<br />The author, an introvert herself, made a great case for how our society has gotten somewhat off-track by dismissing the quieter among us and holding the loud mouths up as our heroes, without putting down or insulting extroverts, who of course, have their own lovable qualities. (Incidentally, the author is married to an extrovert!) I found this book fascinating and couldn't put it down. Most importantly, I came away from it with a better understanding of my loved ones. Now many of the things that they do that used to frustrate me, I inwardly chuckle to myself and think...&#34;of course....classic introvert behavior!&#34;
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Really enjoyable I like this because I've always wanted a horse and this game is probably the closest I'll get
B005LJKEXS|5.0|I ran this under my house in the crawl space from my computer room to my living room. This goes from a PC to a powered 7 port USB switch and I plug in xbox 360 wired controllers to play Steam games in big picture mode. It works flawlessly!
B003ZJJFKE|4.0|Joe Satriani is the Greatest instrumental guitarist, ever. This album is really good. After so many albums, even Joe copies himself. For some great, fresh instrumental guitar with absolutely incredible shredding and beautiful songwriting, check out these albums [[ASIN:B007ZTHKZM Secret Planet]][[ASIN:B00A8Z8DOW Roach Hotel]].
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pintrest. Best app I have on my Kindle. I have tons of great recipes and crafts to do. It is full of great ideas :)
B007V65R54|3.0|I was rather disappointed in this book.  It has some great excepts, but it seems to wander all over the map.  It feels like he had a bunch of columns that he had written that didn't quite fit his new blog format, so he gathered them together into this book.  There are some interesting and insightful segments, but I have to stop short of an enthusiastic recommendation.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Really enjoyed this novel, though I don't want to think about how accurate this scenario might be.  Highly recommend this continuation of the Jack Ryan universe.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|When I first got my Kindle Fire. I tried this app and at that time it only downloaded about a dozen posts. With this download it shows all of the<br />Facebook posts.
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|Really enjoyed this novel, even though it didn't star Miles.  Fast paced, great action and a fast read.  Terrific continuity with the rest of the Vorkosigan universe...highly recommend it if you liked the other stories.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book kept me guessing until the very end!!! It's been a very long time since I've had a read this enthralling. Wile a murder is not my typical genre, Mr. Landry does not delve so much into graphics that it freaked me out. Just enough to paint the picture. All I can suggest is READ IT!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|this series is such a good read!! couldn't put it down and just had to keep reading! very easy to read
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Thank you for your safe and speedy shipment of my &#34;Logitech G13 Programmable Gameboard with LCD Display  &#34;.  It is a quality product at a air price.
B002WIDRM6|4.0|This was my first country CD and I love it.  I bought it for the Need You Now song, but oooops I must've ordered the wrong version.  I was looking for the version on the radio that makes me howl it's a quarter after 1 and I'm a lilttle drunk and I need you now, but I ended up with a cleaner version--my mistake--still a great CD though.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|This is a very versatile weather program that always has the information I need. I particularly like that you can keep track of different cities around the country and around the world. You can also use the clock feature to see what time it is in those cities. The gps feature is helpful for the weather forecasts to follow you wherever you are. Need to see if a storm is heading your way? Use the radar feature to see an up to date radar animation. And one of my favorites is the graph view, it gives you a visual idea of the weather changes for the next ten days quickly. I would recommend this app to anyone.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Thanks Amazon for the fast & free delivery! This CD is so hot! Unexpected sounds from such a young group. It's got a sultry old school R&B and rock thing going on.  Looking forward to future releases.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game.  Graphics are awesome.  My4 year loves this.  Wish the missions could be a little easier. Like the new York version better.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I would recommend this book to all the females in my family and a few of the fellows. I think they would enjoy it too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|One if the best games ever invented! It's so addicting and its fun!! Totally worth everything for it!! AWESOME!!! I love it!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This book is so insightful and inspiring...it teaches us to live fearlessly and see the magnificence In ourselves and the world!
B00APUYWYA|1.0|Can't believe this movie is rated as high as it is.  For every 20 jokes attempted, maybe one was funny.  If you're over 30, stay away.  And the constant references to \\"Breakfast Club\\" were insulting to that movie.  This movie had a a lot of potential, but missed, missed, missed.<br /><br />Aca-orrible
B00006CXXU|5.0|I fell in love with the singles when they were first released, but was too shy to buy the album because of how provocative Christina's image was for promoting this album.  I'm glad I finally did though.  She made a wise move on deciding to work with Linda Perry and Scott Storch, because all of the songs sound strong and emotional.  Standout tracks for me include the lead single, Dirrty, Cruz, and Can't Hold Us Down.
141659521X|5.0|is always top notch and I can hardly put it down once I start reading. This one did not disappoint either.:)
B002XTBE6K|5.0|\\"Emma\\" staring Romola Sadie Garai is wonderful.  She is so beautiful with great facial expressions, she was just stunning.  Although Jonny Lee Miller is likeable and did a good job, I didn't have that feeling that I wanted them to get together like it should have been. I would have liked a bigger, handsomer guy for a match with such a beautiful woman. It seemed to me through the years, they were just good friends and didn't know they loved each other until they danced at the ball.  As pretty as she was, and he was older and rich, I think that he would have tried to sweep her off her feet before anyone else got her.  I would have liked him to steal a few kisses throughout the movie to let the audience know he felt a sensual spark for her.  Except for those two points, I just loved it. I love historical romances and this movie brought all the clothes, the old way of life, conveyances, etc. to life for me. I enjoyed all the varied personalities in the many characters, but above all to me, Romola Garai's star quality made this a beautiful success!
B001VNB54A|5.0|TV series I missed it when it was on so this one had to be bought so I could see the segments I missed
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this app! I always tell my friends and family before an egg hatches or when two dragons are breeding. Note to self, so NOT spend all your gold in the first five seconds. You'll be sorry... but still I love it!
0385344333|5.0|by one of my favorite authors. Lee Child never seems to fail me in any of his books that i have read, and I read them all
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I enjoy this game's)')! does has some problems loading  sometimes! it stays at the main screen or a black screen but over all it is cute!!!
0891419063|5.0|for the WW2 fan as I am still reading it as it is hard to realize what these men went through during their service to us all
B000P0J024|5.0|So many people have heard and enjoyed music by this astounding collection of world class artists and still dont know who they are. If you havent bought this yet then press the button. And I saved real money buying it through this seller
B00AREIAI8|1.0|it has buggs and virases I had to by a new kindle because of this stupid game BEFORE my kindle went dead it was si supid and all you do is feed the horse or train the horse....,b
B008OJ291W|5.0|No brainer here. Love ELO so obviously i'm gonna love this. only thing to report here is that the seller was very fast at shipping and it saved me a few bucks in buying it. An added bonus is not having to plow through a stockpile of justin beiber and nikky manage to find it. Whew
B005MMJ84K|5.0|I loved this book so much.  I can't decide if i like Delirium or Pandemonium better.  It is neck and neck.  I wanted to scream at the book when she started to have felleings for someone else though
B00992CF6W|5.0|I don't now how to update it my dreams who has a iPad  mini and he can update it can you even update it  on the kindle?
630463949X|5.0|Love it, forgot just how many songs they did. It's those one of DVD's that you can listen to over and over or bring with you to a gathering to have as a background entertainment.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|This album is a beautiful mesh of their personal style and oddly enough, very eighties inspired. I've loved Tegan and Sara music since I was 12 so I'm probably a little biased but I love that they're growing so much as musicians and this album is almost the epitome of that fearlessness toward new things for them.
B003UPPO2G|4.0|I love the Bee Gees so I certainly enjoy the DVD. Granted this was made awhile ago, maybe 10 years or so, so the quality of the photography was just fair. However, being able to re-live all the songs made it well worth it. A DVD you can pop in and enjoy over and over
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I'm so glad that &#34;Smash&#34; Season 1 was available on Amazon. It has really helped me catch up on the episodes I missed last year.
B00000AF95|5.0|Anything by KISS rocks! When my neighbor makes me mad, I crank Burn Bitch Burn. It really works! Great song!
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|This is a very funny movie the whole family will enjoy. My son is 11 and loves the monster characters and story.
0345803485|1.0|If you think you can have tons of rich powerful men all over you though you can't bother to do anything for yourself including bathe, wash your clothing or comb your hair, this is the book for you.<br />If you think you can be considered smart and clever and not get through university without knowing how to open an email account, this is the book for you.<br />If you dream of having all your financial problems resolved through the luck of roommates with rich parents or attracting the right guy with your ass though you never bother to work out, this is the book for you.<br />If you dream of having a man constantly tell you to eat disgusting unhealthy piles of pancakes and sausages instead of having to worry about your figure, this is the book for you.<br />If you dream that people are going to see through all your disgusting flaws though you can barely murmur more than the word \\"oh\\" and do more than blush in your life, this is the book for you.<br /><br />IF on the other hand you're a woman who despises book companies generating fake reviews, playing into your psychology to sell a crap book, has a hard time reading unedited manuscripts and has a good grasp of your own psyche, you're going to find this book so bad it will generate absolute contempt in you. You need look no further than the author to understand exactly who this book is for.
B00BAYLS1K|5.0|Being Australian, I have been lucky enough to have this be one of my favourite movies for many years.  I don't like spoilers, and I'm not much good at reviews, but I will tell you that this movie has everything I could want in a movie: music, dance, romance, and... a makeover!  I also listen to the soundtrack on a regular basis; is is one of my favourite albums.  Enjoy!
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I am very happy with this product. It was exactly what it claimed to be and fit my kindle fire hd 7&#34; exactly.  Don't believe the ads that say they are for other products but will fit the 7&#34; kindle fire hd, they don't.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Absolutely loved this book. Had a hard time putting it down and can't wait to start the next one! I would recommend this to anyone.
B004LSJCJM|4.0|Living in a Dust Bowl....I find this song addictive..listen to it over and over.  The rest of the cd is allright but I just love that song and love to listen to Joe do what he does best..play guitar!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|it is a really fun game but it takes so long to loud.but it is really really really really really really really really really really really fun!!!
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Missed it theaters, so glad it came out so soon. The ending was not what I expected, great twist! Will buy it for my collection.
B001250SAY|5.0|This book was purchased used from an Amazon 'subcontrator' and was read for a book club which is working its way through the top 100 classics.  It was a terrific read and an eyeopener of what happened during the '30s in the dust bowl of the American west.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I am new to the Kindle Fire, but so far I love it!  This is the first game I have downloaded and it is quite challenging on some of the steps, but I'm really having fun with it.  If you like Angry Birds, I think you just might like this better.
0446580848|5.0|we didnot receive our copy till 2/6/13,It was very long getting to us ??Dont know what happened but glad  it finaly got here. I am reading it now and it is VERY interesting, so glad it finaly got here. Would recomend it to any one who likes Adventure books. I am going to look forward to reading other books by this author.<br /><br />  Tom DeLoyd<br /><br />  Torrance Ca.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved the drama between the privileged and the working class. It recreates a history that has passed but must have been an exciting time.  It is very emotonal.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I bought this for the Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;. I did think I could also access it from my PC, but that is NOT the case, unfortunately. My kids LOVE this game. They are currently having a competition regarding the highest points/most coins/etc., and have great entertainment on-the-go.<br />I, personally, could do without the horrible repetitive noise of the squealing monkeys; I have them turn down the volume. But otherwise, this is a huge hit.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game will test you skills. It's like a test of how fast you can really move. I would recommend this game to anyone!!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is John Grisham back at his best. A fast paced, well-written adventure with interesting characters and a great story line. One of his best yet.
B00123IB32|3.0|Thsi CD is ok, but the songs do sorta sound sthe same after a while.  Also the second or thrid song has the 'f' word repeated over and over..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game everer Hugh Hewitt the Sunday Times tabloid to be a good idea of what you are looking for.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Arctic silver is the best product on the market for cooling solutions.  I have been using them for over a decade, and they blow any other compound paste out of the water.  Not even a competition.  You can expect to drop your cooling temps by 40% or more over your old compound.  There are many variations available, just make sure you are selecting the right product for your needs.
B00B01YJK0|5.0|I was with silent hill from the first video game and haven't left since. I have the first movie poster from the theatre. Honestly there were a couple things I did not agree with but that did not stop me from enjoying the wonderful world konami made called silent hill. This<br />Movie followed the game almost to a T. The new additions to make it a movie worth watching, were amazing. I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. I can't be too critical because I'm a huge fan of silent hill. I'll love it till the day I die and hopefully I can find my way to silent hill one day.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Both my daughter (6) and I enjoy playing thus game. It is highly addictive!!! It reminds me of the game I played at the local fair when I was little!!
B009NYF2ES|1.0|I bought this movie cause it is one of my favorite films starring Liza Minnelli.  the packaging is very nice but the movie is the problem.  I movie appears grainy, all the way through...this is the 2nd movie that I have bought on blu Ray that has this grainy appearance, the other was Pillow Talk, I will think twice about buying blu ray movies of films over 10 years old because the quality is not much better than regular dvd's.  Do not buy this, cause it is a huge disappointment.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I think the book is absolutely brilliant. I'll read it again. I always get excited telling people the book is about fictional interviews from fictional characters that had important rolls in a fictional event that occurred 10 years ago originally gathered for a fictional report but the interviews were found too personal by a fictional committee and removed from the report and now they are gathered for you here. I also greatly enjoy how the book assumes that if you are reading it, you lived through the war and it doesn't tell the history of the war, rather you have to derive this and imagine the war and how you may have survived through the chronological personal interviews.<br /><br />I also tell people it has little to do with zombies and most to do with human nature and triumph over adversity. I find that anything these days that shows the potential good in human beings is worthwhile in this age of seeming suffocating apathy and indifference to issues we face.<br /><br />World War Z, the movie, I liked it, but it's typical well done Hollywood crap. Brad Pitt was great. Overall I found it fun mindless &#34;checkout line&#34; entertainment. It should by no means bear the name World War Z. However, since it does, it may bring more people to read Brooks' amazing book.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|For most of the time there just isn't anything worthwhile to watch on televsion anymore and it has been that way for a while now. This is one of the few shows that captured my interest and holds onto it with each passing episode. Season one starts out a bit slow, but not that bad. I don't what to say anything to give anything away, but if you like shows that make you pay attention and make you think, I think you'll like this one. Of course, I don't watch television anymore. I rent the DVDs instead. As I initially said, there just isn't anything worthwhile to watch anymore. Overall, I recommend this series without reservation. I just rented season 2 and will review that seperately.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|This game takes two players. It is fun, but there isn't a way to remove a player (that I have found) if you have accidentally selected someone or if they won't play.
0525478817|3.0|I originally purchased it because I had read and seen such good reviews about it online but the truth is I did not find the book memorable at all. It is a fast read so I actually skimmed through it in a day, but as for the storyline it was not my favorite. I am not saying that the book was not well written, but it was just not memorable enough. After I finished reading it I did not know what the characters names were. Or maybe I just do not like books with this tone. Overall I would not recommend for you to not buy it though because in general many people did love this book, so I am in the low percentage.
B0086700CM|5.0|I just can't seem to get any further than I am. Fun though! It progressively gets faster, stimulating your mind to work faster...good stuff!
034580404X|3.0|Okay so here is the deal. I purchased this series because everyone, their mother, grandmother, aunt dog cat and neighbor (With a couple of other people) were raving about it. Everywhere I went, even at work, all I could hear was Fifty Shades of Grey this and Fifty Shades of Grey that! So I finally caved in and bought the series to see what everyone was talking about. I read each and every book and I was so disappointed. If it were up to my personal opinion I would give this book zero stars simply because it was actually a porn movie in words and had no real plot. I enjoy reading a book with twist and turns and intelligible story lines that will keep me entertained and on the edge. But this book was anything but that. Regardless of my extreme dislike though, I give it 3 stars because I know that sex sales and for many people, this book will be arousing and interesting, if you're into that sort of thing. Now for all of you out there that actually like to read and are not buying this book because everyone else then I highly recommend for you to just forget it even exists. It was well written but not a good story. It was well written to entertain an audience that does not usually like to read and will only be interested in picking up a book because of the sex.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|If you've never played, its time to give it a shot! It is very relaxing to me. It helps clear your mind by total concentration on what you are doing! :)
0545265355|5.0|It is out of the question! Of course you need to get and READ the Hunger Games series! And not just the first book, but all three! The movie already came out and everyone loved it! I do not usually say this but even the movie is just as fantastic as book. I do recommend this book even if you have already seen the movie though because there are many things that are described in the written story that will not be valued by you just watching the film! So please do me a favor, do not embarrass yourself and buy AND read the book! Everyone already has! P.S. it is currently one of my favorite series...
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This one is progressive. It is easy in the beginning but gets harder as you go along...good for clearing the mind!
B00APJLFEG|5.0|I didn't realize that this movie had so many stars doing voices in this movie.  I am adding this to list of the few Adam Sandler movies I can watch.  My boys really enjoyed the movie and still use the phrase blah blah, I never say blah blah.  Very entertaining and well done.
1616550414|5.0|He was very pleased with it and his Dad told him to take very good care of it because it might become a collectable book someday.
B001ER4CPC|1.0|The reason that most people would be interested in this collection is because of The Thirteenth Floor and Screamers.  Sadly both are the full screen versions, while the third film (which is a big turd) is in wide screen, go figure.
B000002TP7|3.0|Acid trip+60's music+70's music+80's music+rap= Ill Communication.  I have thousands of CDs.  This is definitely one of a kind.  There is nothing like it out there.<br /><br />Beastie Boys be Illin'
0547569653|5.0|Very well written, well edited and interesting.  I really like the style of throwing in recipes or running tips into the story.  Really opened my eyes about how little funding there is for this sport to think that a runner would have to camp out after a run because they couldn't afford the hotel - especially one of this caliber.  The disparity between sports is never more aparrent.  Obsessive or fanatical - they are still very much super athletes and to see that dedication with so limited prize money really hits home how much they dedicate themselves to their passion.  Don't often write reviews - but I'm only a casual runner - thinking of doing a 1/2 marathon and still found this very relevant and easy to read.  If you've read Born to Run you should definitly read this one as it provides a different perspective.  Nice to see such a good first effort, I would definitly read more from him.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|Saw the movie and thoroughly enjoyed the sound track. Bought the CD so I can enjoy it at home and in my car.
B0043VDIAG|1.0|I have no idea why people find this story so telling and compelling that it needed to be made into a movie. This book did not at all measure up to the hype and reviews.<br /><br />The plot itself was something you would expect from Nicholas Sparks and so I can't say I didn't appreciate the sweetness of the story. What I was disappointed with was the way in which the story was narrated, I found it very hard to really feel the story and buy into it all. A lot of the time I felt I was reading a lot of words and they were all saying the same thing. I presume this was to portray the mindset of the character however it didn't come off.<br /><br />Maybe my expectations were just too high but this book I think was a waste of time, particuaraly when I felt like I was seeing the same words over and over.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|I could not put this book down.  It is full of mystery and intrigue which kept me guessing until the very end.  I liked the way it went between the past and present in a smooth transition to unravel what really happened.  This book is probably most enjoyed by women.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really get a kick out of this addictive game. just like the first you don't have to pay for anything if you don't want to. I play it on my kindle fire and it works just great.
