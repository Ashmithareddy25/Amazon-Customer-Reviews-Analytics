B00APUYWYA|5.0|awesome movie my family is still singing all the songs from the awesome new hit movie. i recommend it as a great movie on family night. the whole family will enjoy it for years to come will become a family favorite.
B00122MY90|5.0|Love Michael's versions of old standards.  Enjoy it very much on my way to work.  Makes the hour drive much more enjoyable.
B0040JHWKS|5.0|When Bruce Springsteen released Darkness On The Edge Of Town back in 1978 he was faced with rave reviews but what could have been on there was a lot that had been left behind which is what's contained here. Some of these songs were recorded by other artists, i.e. Robert Gordon, Southside Johnny & The Asbury Jukes and the title tune of this collection was actually a contender for Darkness but was left off due to interpretations being of the lawsuit between Springsteen and his former manager Mike Appel(Which wasn't the case really). There's even a hidden track at the closing of this collection-&#34;The Way&#34;. Other Darkness outtakes are included on the 1998 boxed set Tracks also whereas the ones featured here capture the true spirit of Bruce and The E-Street Band musically. Just hearing the material is proof positive. It is truly a treasure of material from the Boss himself. Rock out!
B004NEY9EW|4.0|Casino Royale was a great introduction for Daniel Craig as James Bond.  This was a somewhat disappointing follow up.  If you love Bond, you'll enjoy the movie, don't get me wrong.  Just not the best Craig version.
B00992CF6W|3.0|there is much to love and hate about the current mobile edition of minecraft. please note that the version I have is 0.5 alpha and as new versions come out, my personal rating could change.<br /><br />on my kindle is 7, it runs smooth and the draw distance is fine, not too claustrophobic. in fact, I would say the short draw distance actually benefits the game since  the map size is so truncated. but that's not why I've docked the game 2 stars.<br /><br />The one missing feature that I crave are CAVES. the world seems to be woefully bereft of features. I have mountains to scale, sure.. but actually digging doesn't have the feel of real pc minecraft. you won't break into some hidden cave full of zombies or skeletons. to me, the procedural terrain generation makes minecraft into a game I want to play, but it needs to be both above and below ground. missing this feature means the game will sit on my kindle without much love outside of a quick creative mode flyby.
B004HYDM0A|4.0|Heard about this movie; thought it was interesting but some parts were boring.  Good plot, worth watching especially with teenage kids.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|This movie started out very promising and then just got strange. I recommend you save your time. This gets one star and that is for Bruce Willis alone.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|My older boy had said this was a great fun group game, he's been playing with friends, so I decided to get it for our family. Really fun, endlessly variable on how it's set up. It's most fun with at least 3 players.  I will be getting some of the expansions for it soon or purchasing this again as my boy took it to college with him to play with his friends there.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I could not put this book down! Harkness'  writing is so visual, I felt as though I was part of everything that happened. I can't wait to tear into the next book in this series!
B000F9RB8A|5.0|Got this as a gift for my older boy who had put it on his wish list. He was thrilled.
B0010SKUYM|3.0|The story takes awhile to move but the result is like running bull gaining momentum for its charge.  I enjoyed the charge until it hit a wall of repetitive story line that soon became difficult to read. The author SOON became lost in his use of describing things and forgot how to tell a story.  For a character so blessed with intelligence, he SOON became annoying and boring.  The action became non existent and thrown in at times as almost an afterthought of the author.  This book has interesting ideas but SOON reads like an essay instead of  story.  Toward the end I was frustrated and annoyed at the main character and his  boundless ego and flawed intelligence.  This book is to fantasy as a bucket of water is to a fire.  I gave it three stars for what it could have been, not for what it is.
B00355L2TU|5.0|My wife does this everyday. Jillian is great, and this workout is intense! Digital version has good quality video and sound.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love this story and it was so well written..........twists and turns in the plot kept me from putting it down!!<br />Ms. Hoover is a definate voice to be heard....Will read her other books.
B002RI9HUM|5.0|Great insight into the psych of people with addictions. Makes one realise that it is so easy to slip into a similar state of mind, how to get above it all was very entertaining. Crisply written with clear message wrapped in comfortable humour.
B007OWRBJK|4.0|I just finished your book and it felt like I had sat down with an old friend while he told me about his life and loves.  I always wondered what my life could have been like had I too been successful in music.  And though I am truly grateful for the life I've had so far, it was a romp to imagine it, even for a little while, as one that I wish had included you.  Thank you for the book, but more so for the wonderful music you have brought to my life over the years - it got me through some difficult times.  Though we don't know each other I have always had you around in one form or another.  Be well and stay free.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A Higher Call was a very interesting story; learned a lot, especially from the German side of World War Two.
B003O86FMW|5.0|What a great book!!! I love how it just reels you in and don't want to put it down. I can't wait to read the third book!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This has been quite educational!  It certainly has changed my perspective about the aristocracy and servants.  This is a good, clean program that teaches good values.  It has great character development which shows one can choose a higher road.  I highly recommend it.
0345803493|1.0|*This has spoilers*<br /><br />I had to take a Tylenol or five after finishing this over 500 pages pile of turd, and yet I still have a screamer of a skull-throbber. What a mess of a book! I wanted to rate this trash 0 stars, but Amazon wouldn't allow me. One star is far too generous for this crap! My subconscious mind is livid! There should be a law against a book that glorifies abuse and stalking. Words fail to properly convey my disgust. I really tried to give this book a chance. I truly did! But it's like Ms. James wanted readers to have their gag reflex tested. AAAH, this trash made all my nerve cells recoil in revulsion! Christian still makes me want to punch him to a pulp! I am STILL amazed that this piece of crap got on the bestsellers list. HOW? Did a teenager write this book and sell the book to Ms. James? Because I cannot fathom that a grown woman has written this piece of OFFENSIVE  TRASH! I don't know what possessed me to pick up the second book (thankfully borrowed), especially since I barely survived the first book. I really must do something about my curiosity - this time it got my brain cells spinning faster than the act of whisking eggs. I'm still dazed after having  read the same regurgitated words - gasp, snap, impassive, lascivious, salacious, oh my, flush, blush, prickling scalp, cocks head to one side, mutter, murmur, lip biting, frown, bemused, unbidden,(and I'm naming them off the top of my head - because it's frigging seared into my memory bank!). And in case you're wondering, Ana's subconscious mind and inner-goddess return full-throttle - much to my dismay.( Note to Ms. James: the subconscious mind does not argue, rationalize, talk-back, deduce. Hence, the word SUBconscious because it's below your level of conscious awareness. ) The tortured reading was punctuated by my deep, insufferable sighs, to the point that my sister asked me if I was having an asthma attack! Honestly, the thought of an asthma attack sounds more pleasant than reading this pile of manure!<br /><br />I don't know where to start to list my core issues with this crappy book. I HATED this book on a visceral level, in every single way - from the EXTREMELY POOR WRITING to the HORRIBLE characters! Let's start with Christian the Sadistic-Control-Freak-Worst-Male-Protagonist-EVER, shall we? Ms. James continues to describe his good looks on nearly every single page!! Perhaps so she could fill in her word count. Apparently, Ana is not the only female that flushes and blushes in his proximity, every female under the sun does, with the exception of yours truly. I'm allergic to manipulative jerks and my inner-sex kitten agrees. Ana whines and says, \\"This is something I have to contend with for a long time, other women wanting my man.\\" Dear Clueless Ana, no sane woman would want your stalker.<br /><br /> Even though the abuse has gone down a notch, he's still as controlling as he was in Fifty Shades of Abuse and every bit as needy and possessive! My subconscious mind and I gaped at Ana for tolerating the crap! Has she no backbone whatsoever? Because my subconscious mind has rolled up her shirtsleeves and is prepared to plant one in her! He has a file of Ana's records (birth certificate, social security number, resume, employment records) - stashed away in a cabinet without her awareness or consent!! I HOPED that Ana, by some miracle, would do the right thing and leave this domineering douchebag, but nope. Am I the only one who has jarring, warning bells going off in my head?? Please tell me you find this monumentally creepy? Imagine you have a daughter and you find out that her boyfriend knows her bank account number??!!!  Please don't tell me that you'll describe him as husband material because he's handsome and owns half of the planet? I'm thisclose to institutionalizing myself if no one sees the crux of this problem! This is exactly what Ms. James is trying to tell the world - and has unfortunately succeeded. It's perfectly fine to overlook a person's shortcomings, misdemeanors, crime record as long as he lavishes you with state of the art gadgets and cars and a wardrobe of high-end clothes that could make Cher from Clueless grow green with envy. So WHAT if he BOUGHT SIP; the publishing company of  Ana's work place because he must control her every move and remain in charge. So WHAT if he controls what she puts inside her body?! Here's an excerpt from the book:<br /><br />\\"Dr Greene is coming to sort you out. Plus, I have a surprise for you.\\"<br />Dr. Greene!\\" I halt!<br />\\"Yes\\"<br />\\"Why?\\"<br />\\"Because I hate condoms,\\" he says quietly.<br />\\"It's my body,\\" I mutter, annoyed that he hasn't asked me.<br />\\"It's mine, too,\\" he whispers.<br /><br />Am I the only one who's AFFRONTED by THIS?!! Only women have the right to control their bodies and decide what they put in it. Why aren't women OFFENDED by this?!<br /><br />Psycho Boyfriend didn't even allow Ana to choose the COLOR of her new car (which he, of course, had purchased). HE's even CONTROLLING when it comes to something as banal as COLOR! My subconscious mind is trembling in fright at the thought of ever meeting a Toxic Creep like Christian. Even Ana describes his stalking/controlling as: \\" a man who has no concept of privacy under US law.\\"  Christian is still in his study, no doubt invading some poor unsuspecting fool's privacy and compiling information. The thought is unpleasant and leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. My mind is reeling. He really knows no bounds.\\" \\"epic stalking capabilities.\\"<br /><br /> It's one of his idiosyncrasies - you might say - WRONG! An idiosyncrasy is when a guy leaves his wet towel on the bathroom floor - not when he sends one of his minions to spy on you when you're at work!She has to be driven to work, she can't go out to get lunch, basically the poor woman can't breathe without his consent! This despicable waste-of-space needs to be lobotomized - or at least given a leaflet about stalking/abuse as he rots in hisjail cell - for all of eternity- but, aah, I wish the judiciary system was that fair.<br /><br />The part that got my subconscious mind gasping in incredulity (and had me reaching for my inhaler) was when Christian stripped his ex sub naked and bathed her, while Ana was forbidden from interacting with any males within a 3 mile radius!! EXCUSE ME?! Ana was severely reprimanded for talking in a friendly tone to Taylor, Christian's driver. Christian claimed jealousy! Meanwhile, it's perfectly OK for Christian to undress his ex sub?! So not only is Christian manipulative, mysogynistic, controlling, and overbearing, but he's also a chauvinistic jerk who enjoys greasing the Double-Standard Wheels! He sounds like my dream man! Oh, Ms. James, how on earth were you able to depict women's Dream Man so well?? *Sarcastic*<br /><br />Christian has severe mood swings that ought to be added to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Is he the modern, twisted version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde? His insufferable mood swings are worse than a woman who's having a bad day, migraine, and PMS! It got poor Ana so scared; she ended up Googling the symptoms for Schizophrenia and Multiple Personality disorders! I couldn't help but mentally play the song \\"Psycho\\" by Puddle of Mudd during that scene.  (Note to Ms. James: Schizophrenia and Multiple Personality disorder aren't the same thing. You really should have researched this, in addition to BDSM and healthy relationships - and oh, love.) Ana describes his mood swings as, \\"Mercurial is back in town.\\"  \\"Brusque Christian is gone; playful Christian is back. How the hell am I supposed to keep up with this?\\" \\"I marvel how quickly he turns - mercurial as ever.\\" \\"I really must stop expressing every emotion I feel the instant I feel it.\\"  Yes, Ana, because healthy expression of emotions is the heart of a disordered relationship.<br /><br />Now let's talk about Ana. Doormat, naïve, irritating Ana who orgasms like  a veteran porn star. Scratch that - porn stars are begrudging Ana for having this uncanny ability to orgasm at the drop of a hat!  If she flushes, she orgasms. If she bites her lips, she orgasms. If she stares at her knotted, twisting fingers, she orgasms! I literally skipped the sex scenes because they were all recycled material and well, very vanilla. I've read mystery books that only had a page or two of sex and yet it got me more engaged than this soft, dull porn! My inner-sex kitten rolled her eyes at the vanilla sex scenes and went back to sleep. This book was 80% sex scenes and suffice to say, they were very poorly written. They're like the anti-clitoris!<br /><br />Wallflower, pathetic-excuse-for-a-heroine Ana hides behind the veneer of politeness and friendliness but in actuality she is so snooty and regards everyone with disdain. Ana hates Mrs. Elena Robinson, and honestly, I found Elena far more tolerable than Ana and her avalanche of insecurities, self-esteem issues, and never-ending whining! Ana is a bumbling mess of self-confliction. Even my subconscious mind had to agree with Christian when he accused Ana of emitting mixed signals. She doesn't know what she wants! Since her self-esteem or the lack thereof is tied to her Psycho Boyfriend, she's always in a perpetual state of confliction. She hates being beaten and yet she offers herself to him that way because she's afraid she's not good enough for him. Not good enough for him are the words that can embolden a person's self-esteem! The good Dr. Flynn should take note of that.<br /><br />Psychopathic Boyfriend always described Ana as having a \\"smart mouth,\\" and honestly it left me feeling bemused. (Uh-oh - the word bemused is symptomatic to the ridiculous number of times Ms. James used in this book.) Ana is always staring at her knotted fingers; she's always fretting, gasping, flushing crimson and scarlet. The poor thing is scared of her Fifty Shades of Rage.<br /><br />Somehow, Ana has \\"cured\\" Fifty Shades of Mental Instability from wanting to hit her, but his palms are always twitching to beat her when *GASP* she disobeys him- much like my fingers and palms were twitching to tear this book to shreds!<br /><br />There's NO PLOT to this horrible book! All Ana and Christian did was argue, whine, gasp, flush, have make-up, vanilla sex , blush, murmur, more whining, more sex, control and order her, marvel his beauty, snap at each other, (there's a lot of snapping and lips pressing into a hard line), and REWIND! So this was 500+ pages of mindless whining and moaning pun intended!  Seriously, that was the entire book!<br /><br />Has Ms. James EVER used a BlackBerry? A BlackBerry's distinctive feature is the BlackBerry Messenger. So why on earth do they email each other when they've got the BBM?? It doesn't make sense! This whole book doesn't make sense! When does Christian have the time to oversee his company, much less workout? He claims to work out regularly, and yet throughout the agonizing read, he was attached to Ana by the hip. If she so much as doesn't reply to his emails instantly, he frets and snaps at her. I have no idea how Needy, Possessive Christian built his company, when his maturity is stunted and he's always griping and chasing after Ana.<br /><br />Ms. James cleverly inserted a crazy ex sub (Leila) in the hopes that it would give this book a plot. It didn't.  Bear in mind that my subconscious mind and I were in a near catatonic state throughout the entire boring read. However, we both woke up when we numbly read the part about Leila contacting Ana. Leila was supposedly armed and dangerously unstable - much like Christian.<br /><br />Christian snaps at Anastasia and says, \\"She's unstable and she may be armed.\\" As opposed to YOU - my subconscious mind sneered.<br /><br />My subconscious mind repeated this phrase like a mantra: \\"Please shoot Mr. Psychopath. Please Shoot Mr. Psychopath. Please shoot Mr. Psychopath.\\"  It was the only thing that gave me the strength toflip the pages. We both rooted for Leila to shoot Christian and Ana and end this travesty!  Alas, that didn't happen.<br /><br />Christian's supposed BIG revelation - the one in which he was afraid will send Ana running for the hills, was that he's a sadist, who hides behind the Dom façade, and enjoys hitting brunettes because they look like his mom.<br /><br />That's the BIG SECRET? I feel cheated! I've always known that MR. CEO (Crazy Exemplified and Outrageous) was a sadist from Fifty Shades of Abuse, AKA Book One.  Again, I really hoped Ana would run for the hills screaming; swing by the beauty salon and dye her hair blonde. But in typical Ana-nauseating fashion, she whines and says, \\" I can't give you what you need.\\"  Ms. James, are you kidding me??! He's admitted to physically abusing women and instead of showing an iota of disgust Ana says, \\" what can I do to make you understand that I will not run.\\" HUH??! I don't care about the Sadist's past; he didn't elicit an iota of sympathy from me and my subconscious mind. Just because a guy has a terrible past, that doesn't give him the right to continue the reign of terror. Christian is clearly one sick, demented puppy. And his shrink, Dr. Flynn, is a charlatan and should close his medical practice forthwith! The expensive, empty-headed shrink admitted Leila to a psychiatric hospital, and not Christian?  Excuse me??! From where I'm sitting, Christian is more messed up in the head than Leila! He needs electroshock therapy, while being locked up in a loony bin. Leila hasn't beaten anyone!<br /><br />Ana whines about how she doesn't understand why Christian likes her. Well, I do. Dear Ana, he likes you because you're easy to mold and control. My Goldfish has more personality than you. It's every Stalker/Abuser/Control Freak's dream to have a Spineless Girlfriend like you. I agree with Elena and Jacob, I mean Jose's allusions, Ms. Spineless is head over heels in love with the prick's money! She's gold-digger personified! I'm sure Ana Nicole Smith would beam with pride if she were alive.<br /><br /> Predictably, Christian proposes marriage because every overbearing jerk wants to tighten the Controlling Noose over his victim's neck. The act of stalking, spying and keeping tabs on Ana isn't suffice- as long as he's married to her then she'll be under his watchful eye all the time!  He whines and begs her not to leave him and in that instant, I wished I had a voodoo doll so I could stick pins in him! Okay, I lied. I've been wishing I had a voodoo doll from the moment I made the second mistake of reading this trash.<br /><br />As the non-existent plot moved along at a glacial pace (oops, another word that's been used enough times to make my subconscious mind let out an ear piercing wail. Note to self: I really must perform self-hypnosis in order to rid myself of all this), and my subconscious mind was on the brink of passing out from boredom, I finally spied a sliver of light at the end of this pitch-black, never-ending tunnel of a wretched read. Christian has gone missing! YIPPIE! My subconscious mind, inner sex-kitten and inner-critic (basically all my inner selves) whooped in joy! This was the best news since Leila's breakdown.  My inner-critic warned me that Ms. James will find a way to bring the sadistic freak back - and to my utter disappointment and dismay, Mr. Fifty Shades of Revulsion was unscathed. *Deep sigh* I really hoped he had STAYED missing! My subconscious mind is absolutely crestfallen; she's eating Nutella from the jar!<br /><br />Clearly, both characters do not know the concept of love and healthy relationships, and neither does Ms. James. They're always saying,\\" You. Are. Mine.\\" (That, too, has been reiterated too many times.) And every single time I read those three little words, a chill ran up my spine. I might as well have been reading a horror novel. This kind of language indicates possessiveness and not love!<br /><br />This piece of trash is a twisted version of Pretty Woman. I'm chastened to even compare it to Pretty Woman, since Richard Gere's character is Christian's opposite - and likeable! And Julia's character, Vivian, has more self-respect than Ana and her runaway orgasms. Does she not chafe \\"down there?!\\" SERIOUSLY??!<br /><br />This is the WORST book/trilogy I've EVER READ in my ENTIRE LIFE! I thought Twilight was the worst, but I take it back now. This entire book/trilogy could've easily been reduced to 100 pages max! This entire trilogy should've been a novella, at least to spare the readers and trees! What a waste of paper, seriously!<br /><br />If you're a masochist, or enjoy reading poorly-written books with horrid characters and no plot whatsoever, then this trash is right up your alley. If you possess a semblance of sanity, then please do not torture your brain cells by reading this trash.<br /><br />Laters, baby
B002R5QPRI|5.0|This is a true classic.  The bodyguard protects the singing star from a serious threat from an unknown person.  Kevin Costner plays the bodyguard as a serious, careing, highly skilled professional bodyguard hired by one of the singer's people.Whitney Houston, the singer is initially scornful of the need for the bodyguard and fights against the restrictions to her life that he imposes.  Eventually they fall in love, the threat becomes real and is overcome in a dramatic climax scene.  Houston's singing (I will always love you, etc.) is outstanding.  She is glamerous; he's a hunk.  It's a movie to watch over and over.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|I can handle the new \\" IN YOUR FACE\\" ad format. It is a little annoying,but the game is free. I have even checked out a couple of ads. I assumed the reason the game was free was because it carried advertising. Loved this game until they added more fees AND more ads. Deleted game.
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|No need of a set up,  streaming out really smooth, easy to work with. Waiting for more channels to come.
B00A8V3VVG|5.0|This is a great soundtrack. I love every single song. Quentin is a genius. That's about all I have to say about it.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Interesting, exciting narrative with information about a little known country.  Amazing that the episodes described were almost a prophecy of what is taking place now!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Definitely as raw as the reviews say it is;however, there is an intriguing story.  Have read all three....couldn't put them down.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|An excellent read, most unexpected.  Great depth of characters, with unexpected twists. I was reminded of Forest Gump and how he was linked the things in the world, eg elvis's dancing style, this goes way beyond that in historical events, albeit mostly political and war related.<br />I will definitely search out more books by this author.  A very engaging novel.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addicting! It's similar to Temple Run, but better. They constantly change the scenery too, which I like. I cant believe this game is free!
B0081JPTCQ|4.0|directions not clear for some things and had to play around to figure them out. still working on some things. app does what I expected it to do and more.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|For a free app, this is one of the best.  There are tons of puzzles...easy ones for the kids and difficult ones for the adults.  Both my kids like it a lot.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Would recomend this game to anyone who likes shark games. It is the best one on the market . no trouble with it at all.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|i love shopping on amazon!<br /><br />this allows me to compare prices while in the store.<br /><br />i am a bargain shopper and this app allows me to be the best! :)
B0076DCT2G|5.0|If you like exciting suspense type novels with a touch of humor, you will love this one.  I read Lions Game, The Lion, and The Panther in that order.  Really great!  I've read a lot of DeMille novels, but the John Corey ones are the best (except for Up Country which I believe is his best).  John Corey makes you laugh out loud while you are reading.  If you are not entertained by these novels, I would be shocked!
B001OQCV6A|3.0|I saw the second one first and so I wanted to get this.  I was disappointed, the whole magic thing ruined it for me.  It just made it seem unoriginal.  It was mysterious, but the second one was just A LOT better in my opinion.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its a fun adiccting game that is so awesome. I spent hours playing this game I just know u will enjoy this
B00407PNY2|5.0|I picked this up for the car chase, but really enjoyed the movie.  Good car chase scene through San Francisco, action and suspense.  Good movie to add to a collection too for the price.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|What a story! It's just a book but you can get lost in it!!!  They sizzle in it just tempting<br />each other, a very good story line! hard to put down.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This movie is one of the best I have seen of Phatom of the Opera!! I would highly recommend it to anyone who would love to see a great movie.
B002VISN9E|5.0|I purchased this book for my eight year old neighbour on my kindle. I was concern at his lack of reading ability as my friends son who is younger had read Matilda and found the story very entertaining. I read the book and found it amusing, I like reading children's books for light easy to read entertainment. I had heard of Ronald Dahl but had not before read one of his books.<br />Some of the language may be challenging to a younger child but gives them the opportunity to extend their vocabulary as it is not a chore as they want to know what happens to Matilda?
B009HV2JT8|5.0|The movie what excellent!! My daughter read the book; watched the movie and said &#34;they did an awesome job!&#34; It kept your attention to where you didn't want to leave.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|cute fun but in app purchases are pricey. takes a long time to get enough in game gold to play.
B007EC27QM|4.0|Love the screen and Easy to use, didn't need all the scientific stuff added on so its great you can load a few of those items only when necessary.
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|I loved the original when it came out, can't remember if I have it on vinyl, 8-track or cassette (but can't play any of those conveniently any more).  I bought the CD primarily to load it into iTunes so I can listen on my iPod, and also listen in the car.
B008476HBM|5.0|It took me 48 years to read this book and was delighted that it kept on the edge of my seat!
B007U1FEJE|5.0|It isn't every day that a band from your teen years gets back together for a 50th reunion concert!  The concert was amazing, there were enough of my old favorites to make it a trip down memory lane.  The new songs (the first in MANY years) were also enjoyable.  Naturally, I had to have the CD.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|The paid version is the same as the free version, with the exception of there are no banners or adds that will slow down the game play.  Other than that both versions play the same
B007O3BGZE|5.0|I've greatly enjoyed John Mitchell's work with Frost*, but only recently discovered he also did two &#34;It Bites&#34; albums, &#34;Map of the Past&#34; and &#34;Tall Ships&#34;.  I was able to listen to &#34;Map of the Past&#34; in its entirety for free on progstreaming.com.  MOTP is touching, perhaps best classified as &#34;pop prog&#34;, and Mitchell's vocals and guitar work are poignant and electrifying.  I still get shivers up my spine every time I listen to &#34;Last Goodbye&#34;, and trust me, I've listened to it A LOT!  Have some of the earlier It Bites albums, and more on the way, they are quite &#34;Tears For Fears'ish&#34;, but &#34;Map of the Past&#34; is unique, unlike anything I've heard before in prog, rock, or pop.  Listen to it on progstreaming.com (if it's still there), or just buy it.  You'll be glad you did.
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|Works through wifi. Sees wifi devices, like xbox. Turn on console, start app, pick and play. Works awesome! Love it!
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|The reports are true.  The mike emitted a high pitched buzzing right out of the box.  Replacing the battery didn't help.  I returned it.  Don't buy this mike, folks.  What do you expect for a 20 foot cord?
0307730697|4.0|I do not often read biographies but something about the book Fearless by Eric Blehm seemed interesting enough to try.  It is about the life of Navy SEAL Team SIX operator Adam Brown.  I will admit, I am really not into military books either. So, I cannot even tell you what drew me to this book.<br />  But this is a book about redemption more than anything else.  Adam Brown was an \\"undersized daredevil, prone to jumping off roofs into trees and off bridges into lakes.\\"  He was a good kid who made some bad choices in life and ended up a drug addict.  The story shares Adams road back to freedom, back to God and onto a future as a Navy SEAL.  It is a story of one man's struggle with drug addiction and God's redeeming love.<br />  The book doesn't sugar coat Adam's struggles and I loved that.  Following Christ doesn't mean that we have wonderful things happen every day.  But Adam overcame the difficulties and became a great husband and father.  I was inspired by Kelly's love for Adam and her willingness to stick with him through it all. I found myself rooting for him.<br />  This book was a deeply personal look at one man's life.  I am amazed, once again, at how God can take our broken lives and make them productive again. I am inspired to keep on walking the walk because no matter how hard it gets, God is still walking it with us.  Adam's story reveals a God who can change anyone. A quote on the back cover says \\"Blehm's writing takes you beyond the battlefield and right to the heart of the personal battles, sacrifices and triumphs of one of America's elite warriors.\\" I could not say it better.  This was an excellent book.<br />  I received this book from WaterBrook Press in exchange for my honest review. I was under no obligation to write a positive review. The opinions in this review are entirely my own.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I've watched all the episodes on tv and decided to read the first comic and was surprised by it. Completely different than the show.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|Just watch the last two minutes and you will get the jist of the story. There is little to no character development beyond the reimagining of Robin.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|I love that amazon offers a free app for a day so you can try new apps that you might not have gotten a chance to get!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|To end the hunger games final book it takes be loved character s to death trying to bring peace and love to the world that has been distorted it self
B0085YNML2|3.0|I love that amazon offers a free app for a day so you can try new apps that you might not have gotten a chance to get!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the book it wasn't the first time I read it. I'm glad the end turned out the way it did
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I was so excited to add this classic to my collection on my kindle for free!  Can't wait to read  it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The hunger games is an amazing book series bound to become a classic. The heartfelt moments and wars Suzanne Collins provides is wonderful. I've already read the series twice and every time I finish the last book I am satisfied. It is like having a 3 course meal with a grand dessert
B0000VCZKM|4.0|My daughter was in the play Annie in the fall and it was awesome to be able to give it to her in her stocking for Christmas!
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I love how Phillip Phillips writes his own music and he performs it so well! I don't really have anything else to say, except for he is amazing, his voice is wonderful, and if you think you may not like his songs, YOU WILL!!!
B008FPOIT6|5.0|It was truly refreshing to read a story which ties together the &#34;old&#34; love of books and bookstores with the &#34;new&#34; exciting and seemingly exact science of technology.  I loved the lead characters and the fact that the story takes place in SF, one of my favorite cities in the world.  For a light, entertaining and without a doubt mysterious plot, this book is a great read any time.
B009EANE3M|5.0|Their lyrics are so powerful! Their voices are so good! I can't help feeling like I can do anything when I am listening to them! This is my best purchase so far!
B00A77II0U|5.0|Great game! I loved it! I only wish it was longer.  I recommend to puzzle lovers.  It could have been a little more challenging though.
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|This movie is Oscar material! Oscar Meyer that is. Action packed with the usual degree of hammy lines and head exploding firearm activities. If you're watching it you probably know what to expect. No awards here, just some popcorn fun. Enjoy.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I purchased this as a family film to watch with my kids.  My wife and I really enjoyed this movie growing up.  Now my 8 yr old daughter is a fan.  Certainly a time piece based on its setting, but it still delivers good wholesome fun.  I highly recommend this version and 3-disc collection.  Since I don't own a Blue-ray player it comes in handy in case I do purchase one someday.  You can't go wrong with this.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I liked some of the lines in the movie Ted.  But I thought the overall plot was dull and boring.
B000P0J09W|3.0|This was a blast from the past.  I remember seeing this when I grew up and when i found it at a bargain price on Amazon I thought this would be fun for me and my kids to watch.  While my 5 yr old son was a little freaked out by Chuck almost getting his hand placed in a blender and the Sloth character, my oldest enjoyed the movie just fine.  A good adventure movie with a nice message or never stop trying.  I would recommend the movie for nostalgic purposes, however the Cyndi Lauper video in the bonus features I could do without.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I debated for a long time on weather to get this one because of the price. It was well worth it, let me tell you. One of the best books I've read in quite a while. Very good plot, and really draws you in. Would recommend this to people who love to read and are okay with a bit of spiciness. :)
B000FC0P9E|5.0|I remember reading this book back in middle school years ago and I loved it then. Went on a vacation and decided to reread it on my kindle. It was just as good as before!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Still doesn't disappoint even after two seasons  I wish that there was a little less sex in,yhe show but other than that I cant complain, each eppisode is new and interesting, cant wait to watch season three!
B00992CF6W|4.0|My grandson loves this game!  Keeps him busy for hours.  Great game for him to play.  He wants to play it all the time.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Our kids, 2 & 5, love to play this game with us. They collect coins and feed the animals, also get super excited about hatching the eggs. The only complaint I have is that it's a little too easy to spend money - my husband twice bought land we didn't need with a slip of the finger, and the 5-year-old regularly spends all our acorns on the Scrat game or hatching an egg early during the space of an average parental bathroom break. Perhaps integrating a limited-play option that restricts young users to only certain actions would make the game even more family friendly. Overall, we love it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was compelled to give a review for this book after finishing it only moments ago. It was an amazing, wonderful story. At times heartwrenching yet beautiful. I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to read a true love story, a story about overcoming seemingly impossible obstacles in ones life and finding the ability to live and love again.
030758836X|5.0|This is a book you will not be able to put down once you start it. All kinds of twists and turns and once you think you have figured the mystery out...surprise. It keeps going until the very end. This is an exceptional book and if you are contemplating reading it you should definitely start now. 5 stars!
1400049628|4.0|Very informative but I'm not able to use the info since the ZOMBIES NEVER CAME on 12-21-2012!<br />Maybe in another 5000 years.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|A absolute classic of American English Literature!<br /><br />For sure, a must-to-read to all English speakers, as well English students in the Native english countries or abroad!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Super surprised by how terrific this action movie is.  It's not a terribly cerebral movie. You won't be contemplating high philosophy while watching Dredd, but if ou like your action visceral and peppered with tons of cool dystopian sci fi ideas you'll like Dredd.  Very few contrived scenes.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|loved this movie very funny and entertaining highly recommend for all ages we need more funny movies we were laughing so hard
B0071XO8RA|3.0|I chose this book because of all of the 5 star ratings. It was interesting but took me halfway through to really get in to it. Ending was really the downer for me. Just sort of ended.Wish I would have spent 8$ instead of 20$.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I like it a lot I play it a lot do not trade your prizes you need nine of each do not spend dozed dollars you will need them Later
B0002TJGQS|5.0|It was great to find these batteries on line. I saved money , as my local battery placeses charged me a lot more as they installed them, but installation is so easy. The whole package cost me less than what they charged me for 1 and they were delivered to my mail box in 3 to 5 days which I think is good timeing.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This book is an excellent read about a genius before his time and left us way too soon. I try to think where we would be without him and can't imagine. Should be mandatory reading in schools!
B009H442DG|5.0|The entire cd was beautiful but Auld Lang Syne was magical.  Would love to hear more from the Travolta/Newton-John team, please!
B002ZG98LO|5.0|Introducing the \\"dogs/ companion helper animals\\" was a good idea. No hyper camera movements... New info from the predator world/ environment.  The minority males were allowed to stay alive longer than usual. The film stayed within a tolerable amount of action... Which gives way for some compelling dialog and plot delivery.  My only gripe is my own sensitivity to the loudness of the orchestra, except the part where the multi-planetary horizon is observed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game for to see how it is to take care of a horses and you can buy unicorns
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Typical good King but did not like the ending very much, seemed like Mr. King just got bored and wanted to end the story.  Still worth the read as are all King's books.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Good but it's too hard to get gems. I want a zebra and it costs like 300 gems . You only get one gem per level:(it is good because it is free.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|It will pronounce the word!!  Fantastic!! Works like any normal dictionary except it pronounces the word so you can hear it.
B0051MKMNC|2.0|I enjoyed watching this one, but found it a little dissatisfying, and the more I thought about it, the less satisfied I was (mostly about the script; the acting and camerawork were both excellent).  My big problem with it, is that this is, in essence, a Faustian bargain tale.  Such tales should not have a happy ending; it gives a moral of \\"if it seems to good to be true, go for it.  Maybe it won't be\\".  Not exactly either uplifting or properly cautionary.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a book I couldn't put down.  I personally loved the characters in it.  I couldn't turn the pages fast enough  I will now read her other books as well.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this version and highly recommend it. We missed the first season and are happy to have this for our collection.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Omg this book is just so perfect! It was amazing to read. I enjoyed every single emotion I went through. I think I'm going to read it again, because my heart feels empty now that it's over :(
B008602KQI|3.0|******MINOR SPOILER ALERT*****<br /><br />Obviously there was a ton of hype surrounding this movie, so I couldn't wait to see it. I haven't read the book so my impressions relate solely to the book, and I found it wanting. There seems to be a lot of going on, but the timing was weird. The first half hour was at District 12, yet not a lot of revealed about the people there, the main character, the politics, how they got in the situation they were in, or anything that really mattered except how Catniss and Peeta ended up in the games. In contrast, many things that were pretty important are glossed over in a minute or two. Many things are eluded to, but not explained fully. I suppose the book fleshes them out, but it left me scratching my head and wondering why I should care.<br /><br />The settings did a good job of contrasting the wealth and party atmosphere of the capital vs. the poor and miserable existence in the provinces, but it doesn't really say WHY it is this way. There is obviously some sort of cultural conflict and enforced submission, but WHY? How exactly? The few lines addressed to that doesn't help.<br /><br />I thought the comic book feel of the fashion was an odd choice. It was like a blend between the 1980s, King Louis XIV France, Batman, and ancient Rome. I was confused. The poverty was real enough so why go off in a fantasy direction with the wealth?<br /><br />As for the story, I guess there wasn't enough of it to make it great for me. I felt like I was given a skeleton. It was a fair skeleton, but not enough to make me want to watch more. It might have been more interesting if it had been more of a reflection of reality. The lottery scene in district 12 shows a wide range of people, but the ones who were selected all had some special talent. Where were the fat kids, the sickly kids, the ones with glasses?<br /><br />I'm not asking for someone to explain it to me. I don't really care. I am just letting you know that if you haven't read the book, you may be as bewildered as I was. I didn't hate it. I just didn't have enough meat to give me a good flavor or desire for it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I honestly think that this is the book I have ever read in my life so far, it is absolutely amazing, once I started reading it I couldn't put it done. So congrats to Stephen Chbosky for writing such an amazing book.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It continues to be a great series, can't wait to see how things end this season for our friends of Downton!
B0086700CM|5.0|i thought temple run was a great game though temple run 2 was way better in my opinion beat game ever
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Great puzzle strategy game. It's a bit challenging for my 5 year old, but with practice she gets better. So I would say it's best for 5 and up.
B000002UDG|5.0|The CD's condition matched what the vendor stated.  I finally found one of Paul McCartney's CD that contained all the songs of his I was looking for.  I plan on spending many hours enjoying listening to them.
B00003CXRM|5.0|One of my favorite movies. A modern classic. I think everyone should have this in their DVD collection. I would say though that it's not suitable for anyone under 16.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I may be weird, but I love dark dramas, and this one doesn't disappoint.  It's not just zombies being killed, it has heart and human emotions and interactions.  You come to care about the characters.  You also can't wait to see the next chapter!
B005COO1X6|1.0|I have read most of mr king's stories and books with much enjoyment. this story just used his usual foul language to do the usual putdown of maine. there was no plot and no characters. a total waste of his time to write and my time to read.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|This movie was just okay in my book.  It started out rather funny, but soon lost its appeal.  Lots of expected dirty humor, a teddy bear with no &#34;apparatus&#34; that was a sex-crazed maniac, and a plot line that cost me far too many brain cells.<br /><br />Save this one for the party with the guys that drink a LOT of beer and wait until they are quite far gone and it may be passable.<br /><br />Amazon's delivery was perfect as always!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The Martian is a novel I can highly recommend. The humor is fantastic and the scenario is 100% convincing.<br />There is little else to add, other than if you are reading this STOP and just buy it...you won't be let down.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|Errol's Robin Hood is Hollywood's most accurate version of the legend. The soundtrack is beautiful, the cinematography is wonderful, and the DVD is full of excellent featurettes.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My husband and I are in our 60's and we love the Dr. Seuss movies so we love giving these movies to our grandchildren so we can watch them with them.
0891419063|5.0|If you enjoyed the PBS presentation PACIFIC you should read this book.  Really helps in putting things in prospective and you'll be amazed at the 'afterlife' of Eugene &#34;Sledgehammer&#34; Sledge, a truly unique individual.
B000I0D450|5.0|This is my favorite heist movie.  It has great actors in the lead roles and a solid cast in the secondary roles; the characters are interesting and relatively well-developed for the genre; it is set in one of my favorite cities (Montreal); and violence is kept to a minimum.  Generally speaking, this is not an &#34;action&#34; movie -- there are a few action sequences to be sure, especially at the end; but, overall this is an intelligent movie that focuses as much on the characters and their relationships as it does on the mechanics and planning involved in the heist itself.  That said, it is also relatively fast paced, and there are no boring scenes.  The film even has some romance and a happy ending.  The musical score is solid with a few memorable jazz pieces to boot.  Every time you watch it, you will notice something new; and there is plenty to talk about with friends and family.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I like this game but wish I didn't have to have wi-fi to play it.  It is fun though and I like to play it.
B004VPAXIY|5.0|This is truly a dream album. The songs are just so creative. Have you ever in your life heard another song that's about Houdini's wife? Or a bank heist (There Goes A Tenner)? I'm not 100% sure that I know what \\"Gaffa\\" is, but Suspended in Gaffa is one of my favorite tracks. Get Out of My House sounds to be yet another song about the Devil (overcoming Him). I remember listening to it one night before going to bed, so the lights were out & I had my headphones on. That song will keep your eyes open for sure. It's a wondrous album from start to finish.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|I really like this game!  I play it on my kindle and on my phone.  I play it when I'm relaxing or waiting for someone.
B004VPAXHU|5.0|This is another favorite album for me. You're not going to get better from an artist than a song like Running Up That Hill. And as someone who has a lot of inner struggles, so many of the tracks become outlets for those demons (Jig of Life for example). Waking the Witch seems to be about the Devil, which may freak some listeners out considering He has a voice in it. But not all of the songs are as dark as all that in case you're wondering. Cloudbusting is full of positivity--\\"I just know that something good is going to happen.\\" This album proves that Kate Bush is a musical genius.
B004QX07G4|4.0|I love this book!  She is so hilarious and truthful.  I think that Ellen is a marvel in our time.  She has made such innovations for our society.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Really great game. Very addicting and just like the game at the arcades. Wish the coin limit was higher though. Over all a great game. Will continue to play for many hours.
0545265355|5.0|My niece is 14 and is into the typical girl stuff: Twilight, One Direction, etc. But I refuse to encourage that stuff in my family. so I figured this trilogy would be a good, healthy and thought-provoking thing to get for a developing mind.  The books are fairly popular and have a lot of social and moral themes within them.  Long story short, my niece loved the books.  She read the entire trilogy within two weeks.  She's very excited for the movies to come out.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|One more excellent book by this wonderful author. Nicholas Sparks writes with such feeling and can engage the reader in the first chapter.
B005ZTFPFQ|1.0|Couldn't get it to down load on to my phone. So didn't get to actually get to play it, bummer.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really liked this app. it is so fun and addicting. I liked how you get to train it but I think it should let you do some more stuff with it yourself.
B005FSI1IK|5.0|All of the Vorkosigan stories are fun and interesting. They are among the best reads I've seen in more than 50 years of voracious reading.
B000TETD9Q|5.0|Excellent album, with some of their older music, and a couple of later songs. I was a teenager during the time frame the Beach Boys were popular. My first experience with an mp3 product. So far, so good.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love love love!!! That's all I can say. If you want to read something you can't put down. This is it
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|It was just a great movie, with nice little surprises. I always enjoy when more mature characters come back out into life and kick ass. The unique part of this movie is that it manages to stay lighthearted, comical and still a thriller. And the actors are fabulous, some of my favorites and  work together in a unique way. I was very happy that I selected this film to watch. Something most everyone would enjoy.  ,,,
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have never been a fan of theologies because by the third book I am bored. Not this one. I can not wait to open the third.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good romance! I had trouble putting this book down the farther I got into it!
B000BT97AO|5.0|i love this movie, ive seen it at least ten times since i bought it. it was received in great condition and still plays great
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great series of books. Still need to digest the ending. Looking forward to how the movies will portray the story.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|But want more! The songs are cut short and a few great songs are not included. I guess that's what you mean by \\"highlights\\".
B008HK3XKO|4.0|Great price point for needed protection and functionality. I bought it as an add on for the Kindle requested by my 20 year old son. I wasn't sure how it would go over, but it was immediately used. It is plain and perfect for a yound man,
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I installed this game on my Kindle. I played it for two weeks. It made waiting in lines tolerable.  Great. graphics . I wanted to always know what would happen next.
B004C3DLJS|5.0|Rented this through my computer - it played the whole way through without interruptions! Would rent a movie this way again.
B004ZA9HB4|3.0|Galaxy S3 downloaded fine. Phone, New Samsung 60inch tv all on same wifi would not connect. Gonna try on Xbox later.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|Their first new album in years, they are still rockin!! Some old sounds, some new sounds, but all GREAT sounds! Do yourself a favor and order one today.
B005PK553C|5.0|This is the best series ever. I'm so glad I bought this cause I want to watch it again. WOW
B004W1GCQO|5.0|I have only seen season one, I am going to buy season 2 also.  I hope they make more of these movies. I don't watch movies very often but this season was worth the time to watch it!!!
B009KS4XRO|2.0|This is a very fun game to play, but the game often freezes up, and I lose my credits. There needs to be a way that the credits are reimbursed, when the game stops working.
B00005MKA3|4.0|Originally recorded in 1979 this album sounds as clean as most top notch pop albums recorded in the mid to late 80s easily.  Junior Marvin and Al Anderson had grown more comfortable playing together on guitars by this point which REALLY makes this a good Wailers album.<br /><br />The songs are as impactful as Uprising but not quite as militant.  Survival is the one you can play at a family cookout on a pleasant Sunday afternoon in the park without angering the neoconservatives that always seem to pop up at such events.<br /><br />The ding of a full star comes mainly in the packaging.  The printed lyrics are more of a general direction as opposed to any sort of karaoke help.  And not sure if it was meant to add to the communist flavor of the songs or not, but all of the photography in the liner notes is in black and white.  Kind of a disappointment considering the brilliant colors of all of the flags on the cover.<br /><br />Is this the first Marley album you should buy?  Of course not.  Does this belong in any Marley fan's collection at some point?  Of course it does!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|No art skills required here....stick figures and arrows can do the trick.  The drawings can get pretty funny.<br />Wish people who just spell the words rather than trying to draw something would quit it and just try to draw.
B007SGM084|5.0|I liked the book it was easily read. And it was enjoyable. It kept me glued on to my seat until the very end.
0790731940|5.0|GREAT PRICE GREAT MOVIE, IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE GOOD CLASSIC MOVIES FOR COLD AND RAINY INDOOR DAYS AND NIGHTS
B005HSL626|5.0|fun game if you like chopping fruit and your bored fun game to pass the time great on my kindle fire
B000059GEI|5.0|GREAT PRICE GREAT MOVIE IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE THE GOOD OLD MOVIES TO FALL BACK ON AND SHOW YOUR CHILDREN.
B0017SWSCW|5.0|Another terrific story from the greatest story teller of our times. An uplifting story for all innocent Prisoners who hope that someday they will be free.
B000O77SOK|5.0|We thoroughly enjoyed watching this series when it was on tv and loved being able to see it again on DVD. Now -- if subsequent years' would be made available on DVD life would be perfect....
B00519YRH2|5.0|Tom Hanks is great in this movie. It is a really cute movie. I bought this for my 8 yeal
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I picked up this novel really only with the intention to earn the rest of Collins' plot without the aid of Wikipedia. It was a short read, only satisfactory in the way that the story had finally ended. Collins' writing style is predictable, poor, and relies a little too much on blunt, juvenile descriptions that lack the honesty to make them sound like the first-hand, rough hewn account of Katniss Everdeen. The novel Isn't a total loss; the story is kind of interesting and does feature Collins'Ieffective gripping twists, if you're into cheap dystopian fiction. But let's face it: I should have just read Wikipedia.
B007A2O3FO|4.0|This movie has some really interesting twists and turns.  There are ghosts, a young boy and Maggie Smith.  The story is simple, but takes the viewer into interesting places as the boy explores the hidden nooks and crannies of an old manor house.  The actors are all good in their roles.  There is a second layer story involving the boy making contact with the ghosts, who really aren't as frightening as they are frightened.  The movie has a heart-warming appeal.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app did every thing I wanted and more with the added bonus of a pleasant graphics! I used it all the time! It tells me just how much time I have left with any of the programs I have running. The only way it could be better is if it told you how much time you had left if running multiple programs at once ( ex. Reading while listening to music) but over all, a must have app and at the perfect price!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Life of Pi is a life-affirming and inspiring adventure. I would have loved reading this as a child, as I have truly enjoyed reading it as an adult. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a taste for adventure, and definitely to young people. This book is a treasure.
B001383XT8|5.0|am absolutely loving this pedal,with the myriad of distortion pedals out there one can be at a loss as to which one to buy, i chose this one by Behringer and am glad i did !!, A LOT of Bang for the Buck,, believe me you cannot  go wrong with this choice .... sweyet tones,,,,,,,crunchy bulldozer and everything in between....play with it and find your own sound
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Great, I read all 3 of the maze runner series. They were my grandsons. Any age will love these books, I did.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I got the free version and loved it. Now to get the pay version! Dumb word minimum.so I love q.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am late in reading these, but found it hard to put down once started. I look forward to the next book.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great app. Gives clear info on battery life so you can check what you are doing and see how much battery life you have left. Nice clear graphic. Very pleased
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|I've read all of Pink's books, and like all the others, I could not put this one down. Absolutely fascinating.
B0097AQEOK|3.0|This is not a review of the music, which deserves 5 stars.  Joni Mitchell's music merits the highest possible praise.  Every album on this set is either really good (Song to a Seagull, Clouds, Ladies of the Canyon, Hejira, Don Juan's Reckless Daughter, and Mingus) or wonderful (Blue, For the Roses, Court & Spark, The Hissing of Summer Lawns). If you do not have any previous editions of these CDs or are new to the artistry of Joni Mitchell, I cannot recommend this set more highly.  Essentially you are getting 10 marvelous albums for less than $4 each.<br /><br />However, odds are that if you are reading this review, you are already a fan and own either the lps or the already released American/European versions of these CDs. I purchased most of these CDs around 2002, but since there was so little information about whether or not the CDs in this box were newly remastered, I went ahead and bought it anyway.  I was hoping that maybe Rhino would capitalize on the recent Japanese SACD remasters of these CDs to release something better than what they have already put out on the American market.  Boy, was I wrong.<br /><br />Not one of the albums on this set is at all different from the previous remasters released in U.S. and Europe.  I checked several of the albums and played them next to my older copies.  There was practically no difference in the sound quality. Actually, I noticed several faint skips on the \\"new\\" versions of the For the Roses and Court & Spark albums. I am glad that they have repackaged these CDs in more environmentally friendly (no plastic) Japanese style mini lp slips, but there is no reason why they couldn't release CDs of Japanese quality.<br /><br />Technology has changed and Joni Mitchell is one of the rare artists whose catalog deserved a complete remastering. What a shame that the best available remastered versions are Japanese imports that go for around $50 a CD.  Hopefully some smart executive in the U.S. will realize that there is still an American market for CDs and that the remaining customers are looking to get high quality remasters and not repackaged versions of older discs.

0061191981|5.0|As an avid fan of Hell's Kitchen, MasterChef and Kitchen Nightmares, my wife purchased this book for me as a gift for Christmas. What a great book if you want to learn more about Chef Gordon Ramsay. The insight on his childhood, the strained relationship with his father, his love for his mum, and the way he and Tana have created their family and his beliefs. Some may see Mr. Ramsay and think he is a bully or mean spirited individual, but after reading this book, you understand how hard he works, his drive, his desire to be the absolute best at everything. He came from nothing and now has built an empire, he is honest and open in this book, maybe a little bit too revealing at times, but you get to know him more and understand the way he thinks. You simply have to appreciate a man, that is a world known celebrity chef, and he is still making his dishes on a Saturday night in one of his restaurants. Thank you Mr. Ramsay for sharing your story - I am sure the hardest part was sharing the stories about your brother Ronnie and his drug problems and the affects it has on you, your family and the rest of those that play a vital role in your lives.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|For those of you thinking about watching Season 2 of AHS, just know that season 1 and 2 are not connected in any way. They use the same actors, but they are absolutely not connected with their season 1 character. Also, season 2 has a very different feel from season 1 (I loved season 1, but I can't say the same for season 2). Season 2 is very sick and twisted. The only reason I kept watching is because I am one of those people that has to know how it ends and why things happened. Otherwise, I probably would have stopped. I would have given it two and a half stars, but the show kept me sucked in and watching every episode, so I felt it deserved four stars. I think you will find yourself watching this season, wondering, \\"Why am I watching this?!\\" ...but yet you are unable to stop because you have to know what comes next. This season also brings in a SciFi element, which I think is ridiculous. Basically it's up to you if you want to start watching...but once you start, I dare you to try to stop.
0525953728|5.0|No Easy Day, was the perfect title for this book. Mark Owen does an excellent job at painting a picture for the reader to somewhat understand what he went through in his job and the overall mission. It was a fascinating look behind the scenes. Why the government had such a problem with this book, I will never know. Details were shared but I really didn't feel like anything was a threat to the US or its troops. Each mission has different variables, and what is the chance this occurs again with all the same variables? Very small. I enjoyed the book and wanted to know more about that fateful day and what it was like fulfilling this mission. Mark Owen and the rest of our troops are heroes, and in this book, you get a personal account of what it was like and how it affects his overall life. Thank you Mark for your service and thank you Mark for this book!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I thought it was an interesting and compelling voice to the parent who has to believe in their child inspite of all evidence to the contrary.  Very well written.  It kept my interest to the end and I reccommended it alot

B008WCP2KG|4.0|Fun movie to watch and I also gave as a Xmas gift to a girlfriend - hopefully enjoyed by her also
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The book certainly wasn't what I expected.  The summaries I read don't mention the book is an S&M porn.  Despite this freakiness, I was drawn to the personality of the main character, Anastasia.  She is inexperienced in the social world but very intelligent.  And the main male character is obviously not comparable to any human in real life. But who is reading fiction to find the real world?  It's called \\"Fiction\\" for a reason.  Other reviews have stated that the book seems to be written by a child, but I believe the experiences were meant to be from the viewpoint of an inexperienced young woman.  The only negative review point I agree with is the repetition-- the main emotional points of the main character are drilled over and over.  The trilogy should have been shortened to 2 books.
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|I don't know what the negative reviews are for... this connected to my Sony Blue Ray with no problems. Very cool to see my pictures, videos, and play music from my kindle. I love it! and you do not have to connect it to facebook and if you did you could always change the permissions to only have post visable by you. This is the coolest app I have gotten for my kindle.
B000V6583C|5.0|One of the all time greatest albums ever! If you don't know that you weren't born before the year 1985!
B004PVKFR8|5.0|This is a great album.  Lots of replay value, it will be on my heavy rotation for a good while.
B001EC0OMW|5.0|I'm currently in a film class about vampires and I had to watch this for it. So far, the best film I've seen. Lee is an amazing, alluring Dracula that maintains the scare factor. The character of Van Helsing also really comes into its own here, as this is one of the earliest times we see him as anything more than a scientist who can stake a vampire in the daytime. Lots of action, vivid sets and colors, and all around flawless acting make this one of the true Dracula classics. Well worth watching.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I have noisy upstairs neighbors and this app does a very good job at reducing the noise they make. I also use it for meditation purposes.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Obviously the publicized 1/15/13 US release date has been rescheduled.<br /><br />Amazon UK now has a release date of February 4, 2013 - which is moved back a week from its previous release date of 1/28/13. That release date is related to the required time lapse (17 weeks) between UK theater showing dates and the UK DVD release date.<br /><br />I believe Weinstein owns distribution rights in both UK and US, and would guess that the US release date could be 2/5/13 (always a Tuesday), unless they decide to stagger UK/US release dates. It would be nice if they'd publicize the new date so Amazon.com could post it.<br /><br />(Update 2/5) For what it's worth, this English-subtitle version went on sale yesterday at Amazon UK. It is titled \\"Untouchable\\" there and is a PAL/Region 2 format DVD there. I have an all-region player, so I ordered it yesterday and have an expected delivery date of 2/12. The fact that the US release is delayed, and that Amazon.com hasn't even been given a release date to post, is really annoying. For a film that was huge when it hit French theaters in 2011, the reason for the repeated delay of the US DVD release by Weinstein Co. is hard to fathom.<br /><br />(Edit 2/5) Looks like Amazon.com has now been given a release date of 3/5/13.<br /><br />(Update 2/11) English-subtitle version received from Amazon UK today (7 calendar days from order date with standard shipping). Movie was as good as expected, definitely on my Top 10 list ...
B005SAJJHM|5.0|Best series ever!, has everthing you could ask for in a comedy series, I can watch it over and over again!

B00A9X9ORI|4.0|My wife and I enjoyed this movie.  At times it seemed a little hard to follow because of the going back and forth in time.  Also, the ending was totally unexpected but still good.
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|Great special effects. The main antaganist was nothing that menacing. Karl Urban did a good job as Dredd. Very violent.
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|I got this as a 'Free App of the Day' and glad I didn't have to pay for it. The app doesn't leave the initial loading screen when I open the app on my Kindle Fire HD, so I don't even know if it will link to my TV. Even though this app was free, I feel I paid TOO much for it. *Delete From Device*
B000J233SK|5.0|Loreena McKennitt has an incredible talent for mixing her amazing voice with a variety of instruments to create an original sound that is truly her own. Her interpretation of celtic music is soul stirring with its breathy, mysterious and even sensual overtones. This album is another of her perfections, very moving and a sweet joy to listen to.

0741470314|5.0|for me I am such a huge fan of Michael, I grew up with him, he was my first teenager crush, and if u believe in it, Michael was my first love love I was such a young teenager when I first saw his photo, and fell in love with him, and I really enjoyed this book, it took us fans inside Michael world, to give us fans what Michael went threw while he was on tour or just trying to just having a normal life but it was so hard for him, and only had just a few friends to share it with, and my heart just aches for him. knowing how much he felt like he was so trap inside his world that he wanted a normal life but couldn't do the things we can do and take for granted, like going shopping and just walking the streets. without getting notice. for anyone who is not a Michael Jackson fan, I still recommend u read this book, u will think differently about Michael, in my eyes and heart even more so, I find Michael the most sweetist person and so loving human being that ever walk the face of this earth, and he will be forever the king of my heart and soul. I love u Michael. thank your Karen martiarty for such a wonderfully loving book about Michael.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Hopeless is one of those books that you want to read in one sitting. Your heart aches for Sky before she even realizes her own heart ache. A wonderful book with a perfect ending.

B009U9S6FI|5.0|I had heard of Victor Frankl years ago, but never had the opportunity to read his work, and I'm grateful to finally get the chance to &#34;hear&#34; the voice of a concentration camp survivor.  His observations on the ability of men and women to be more than just the victims of life's suffering are well worth reading and gives much food for thought.  His ideas are as relevant today as when they were written.
B004ZA9HB4|3.0|Not sure why so many negative reviews. This app works as advertised and plays local and internet content to my Panasonic Viera TV. Only 3 stars because I find it to be a little laggy and doesn't do much more than my Panasonic Remote app, or several other 'play to' style apps already on my tablet. It does work, however and Facebook login is NOT required.
0767847431|5.0|I remember watching this movie as a kid and I wanted to try and find it.  Found it super easy on Amazon and I love it still.
B005LAII80|5.0|Watching this at home on our big screen was every bit as much an experience as seeing it at the theater. The disc captures all the beauty and color of the film, particularly in the &#34;drug&#34; sequences. The film is a grgeat action movie, and it manages to avoid turning the female lead as Judge Anderson into a &#34;screamer&#34;. Great movie, and a great disc of it.<br /><br />If you're a 2000AD fan, you won't see as much of Dredd's world here as you might like, but they manage to respect the characters even if the world they show is pretty much 2012 with some Blocks thrown in.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this TV show it has me wanting more I can't wait for season 3 to return Feb 10. I can't wait to see what happens next I know it's going to be good.
B00A8SPNYW|5.0|Great graphics, lots of fun, good replayability. This is really fun and makes a great time-filler. It teaches you how to play, and gets more interesting with every level. Failing is just an invitation to try again, taking a closer look at the map.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|flow free is fun and challenging I absolutely love this app for everyone who cant decide whether to get this or not YOU SHOULD GET IT
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|I got this as TFAOTD.  It worked great to watch Vimeo on my Kindle.  I skipped the login to FB.  I haven't tried to connect to a TV yet.  It would be nice to login to my Vimeo account to rate and bookmark videos after watching them within the app.  If that is possible, I haven't figured it out.  Overall, the video quality was great and the app worked nicely.  I liked it enough to write my first app review.  I am very happy to now be able to watch Vimeo.

B001DHXT6G|2.0|This review is for the \\"Remastered DVD Edition of the Original TV series\\". I recently purchased this from FYE store and I am disappointed. Whereas the picture quality is much better than the 2004 edition, it is missing some essential features:<br /><br />1) No English subtitles - I am not sure why there are no English subtitles. I think it's excusable not to have English subtitles. 2004 edition does have English subtitles.<br /><br />2) Discs have no labels. You cannot tell which episodes are on the disc. I was confused if the discs were two-sided or not. 2004 edition discs were very nice. They actually had photos and the list of all 4 episodes contained on the disc.<br /><br />3) I think the 2004 packaging was much nicer. The outer shell was nicer looking.<br /><br />I will be returning this and probably purchase the Blu-ray release when its price drops to a level that I can afford. I hope the Blu-ray release doesn't lack the above features.<br /><br />If you don't already own Star Trek Original TV series and this will be your first purchase, I guess you might be ok (if the picture quality is your only focus and if you can do without English subtitles and the labeled discs).
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another cant put it down book by Nicholas Sparks! Loved it!<br />No one writes a love story like he does!
B002N83H52|4.0|The principal character is an irredeemable but loveable thief.  That the author could follow his path for so many years makes a fascinating story.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is really great book and you should read it. I chose the rating because it was really great.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app works great, letting me view pins, repin pins, and create new pins while web surfing. No problems with it.
B008WOULPK|4.0|I found this book an honest portrayal of Grace's life. She doesn't just tell about the good times, but delves into her life and personalities she encountered. She takes responsibility for how she could have done things better and enjoys the things that worked out. Her job for Vogue was difficult,exhilarating, exhausting and demanding. I liked her attitude and lack of the superficial.
B00ATPVA78|4.0|Great Game!<br />I really enjoyed this game. I found it to be original. Different storyline. Would recommend. My only complaint was it was a bit too short.
B007ED9FIY|5.0|Clooney is at his best. This film is worthy of its Oscar nominations. Beautifully filmed in Hawaii. A must see.
B005IQZB14|5.0|It's not just a story about backpacking a great trail. There's an interesting back story about family and loss and recovery.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I bought one of these for my daughter to take on a school bus trip to Florida where a single Iphone charge would have had to wait over 24 hours.  With this Anker she could entertain herself with the phone and not worry about conserving power till thet got to a hotel.  I looked at the many types and strengths out there of these charges.  There seems to be a trade-off of size and output.  This Anker at 8400mAh was a nice size and definitely looked to be a 3 or maybe 4 time charger for the Iphone.  I haven't tested that but I can say that my daughter's bus trip got delayed by a snow storm and the 20 or so hour ride turned into an over 30 hour ride.  Of course she turned it off when sleeping but the Anker reliably charged the enough so she was never without power.  Great for the trips where charging opportunities are a challenge.
1416575464|2.0|I wanted to like this book, but it left me feeling like I had wasted my money.  I thought it would be more of a resource book, as in if I saw an item I liked, the resource for that item would be listed.  As well as paint colors chosen would be listed by name.<br />Not the case.  Websites and stores are listed in the back of the book, but that is as far as it goes.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|i have read many books on people having death experiences, and am delighted that a prominent doctor has now taken the time to record what happened to him.  He has the experience to know if this was all hullucinations or something more subline.  Now, maybe this experience will be given more scientific study.  Let's have more such books written by honest scientists who confirm what ordinary people have been reporting for years.

B00338QENI|4.0|If you have ever been to or plan on going to a doctor this book is a must-read! As Rebecca Skloot explores the intersection of advances in the field of medicine, the introduction of patient privacy notions, the expansion of research moral codes through the story of Henrietta Lacks and her family, it is clear that we have a long way to go in finding the balance between patients' rights and the advancement of science.
B00B19DMUE|4.0|This kind of demonic, based on a true story stuff, still scares the hell out of me. More nightmares are on the way for me I think. Great movie. Great acting.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A Higher Calling was a book I had difficulty putting down.  It tells the story of two world war II pilots on opposite sides of the war who for one brief moment connect on a deeply personal level that makes a life long impact on them both.  It gives you insight on both the American and German perspectives on the war.  What unites them is the &#34;human&#34; factor not often publicized.  This story remained hidden for years because it was suppressed by the U.S. Airforce. This reminded me of Unbroken, another incredible true story.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|If you like me like to read stories that touch your hearth this is ONE  not to miss.  Beautiful story

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Unexpected twist. Very well written as are all Colleen Hoover books. This is super quick read.<br />I read a lot and a lot of the books written are pretty much the same story written over and over.<br />Put this on your must read list!
B008B3GP2A|5.0|I like all their music but this has won me over as my favorite. It's worth every cents you put into it.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|I am a huge Depp fan, but this movie really let me down.  It was almost like Johnny lost a bet and had to make the film.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|This is seriously one of the best shows on TV. It's very engaging and makes you want to watch the whole season in one sitting. A must have for anyone who loves the show or wants to see what all the talk is about.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I live that this book has some pretty unpredictable twists and turns. (Yes, I meant live nor love...once you read the book you will understand). There is some tough subject matter, having to go there with personal history of my own, I appreciate the delicate balance between being real and insensitive. I felt like it was a real depiction of what it is like to go through that experience. Loved this book,and its message.
B008Y1YJZY|5.0|Excellent movie for children. Entertaining for adults as well. Very happy with this purchase and I would recommend highly for others.

B006WB7IN8|5.0|Into the Darkest Corner is a very well written book. It gives a great insight to OCD and also how someone gets sucked into an abusive relationship before realising that it is impossible to escape! Love it.
076115678X|5.0|I liked all of the pictures and explanations, step-by-step methods. The ideas presented were not too crazy, or super complicated. My whole family (curly and straight alike) has been using no shampoo for about 2 months now...and our hair is amazing. Our 2 girls (4&5 yrs) used to have a ball of frizz by the end of the day no matter how much conditioner we put in it, but after following the curly girl guidelines, their hair looks a lot like the picture on the front cover. ALSO my girls can now wash their own hair since there is no shampoo. They love how easy it is to take care of & style. No dislikes<br /><br />Recommend product to anybody with hair, and especially those with kids. Look at pictures of your great great grandmother. Look at her hair when shampoo had not been invented yet.
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|Works well so far! Very nice interface. Skipped fb log in, but may do so later and make the app settings &quot;only me&quot; (if possible)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|the writing is witty & historically accurate.  the characters are real - warts and all, and the class positions & pride in their positions are intriguing because they are so antithetical - especially to modern American sensibilities.

1432794426|5.0|I loved the book, it is very well thought out. Dr. Moriarty puts into it the very love and respect for Michael that we fans feel. She leaves Michael's legacy intact and dispells notions that Michael would ever hurt anyone. But I hold in my heart hope he comes back to us. Thank YOU Dr. Moriarty for this beautifully written book.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|You've heard the single on the radio.  The rest of the album is as good and there are some surprises.

Also I've figured out how to get it so the pictures not upside down u just havta make sure the camera icon is on the bottom of the screen and then u havta hold it so it's the long way. Also it has really good applications for ur pics. My friends are always bugging to use it. :) And I've gotten I-dont-know how many complements from friends on how real the drawing feature u can do to ur pictures. if u r artistic, and to take photos, I recommend GETTING THIS APP!!!!!!!

B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Hands down one my top five all-time favorite shows. Can hardly wait for each episode to air. Also enjoy the new story in each season with return characters, the writing set up the actors to be instantly credible in the next story, very impressed with this show, pushes many boundaries without typical fake gore
B004A8ZX28|5.0|Dr Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) and his lovely wife Elizabeth (January Jones) check into their Berlin hotel so that Harris can present a paper on plant biochemistry at a conference being held there. Harris works with Professor Leo Bressler (Sebastian Koch) who has organized the conference. The work has a Middle Eastern sponsor, Prince Shada (Mido Hamada) who is also attending the conference. The taxi driver picking them up from the airport to go to their hotel leaves behind one of Harris' cases, which he does not discover until they arrive at the hotel. He sends Elizabeth to check in while he gets another taxi to get back to the airport. But en route the taxi is involved in an accident, crashes into the river, and Harris is injured and lapses into a coma for four days. When he recovers he finds that someone else has stolen his identity (and his wife!) and is attending the conference in his place. There are so many unexpected twists to this story I cannot say any more without disclosing the plot. Suffice to say this is one of the best thrillers I have seen in some time with plenty of action and mandatory car chases.
B0056CUZRA|4.0|another great losely based, history novel by ken follett, well rounded characters, from many different countries and different socio economic backgrounds - very interesting.

0553381407|2.0|I'm an adult child of an alcoholic with no children of my own. I started reading \\"Toxic Parents\\" about the same time I got the Adult Children of Alcoholics \\"Red Book\\" (which you can get here on Amazon). The Red Book is by far the more insightful, powerful book - at least for me. \\"Toxic Parents\\" is perhaps suffering from being outdated, but even 20 years ago I would have had issues with the excessive focus on \\"confrontation\\" as a solution. Susan Forward seems to have attracted a certain type of client - clients who have been cowed and silenced by their parents. I reacted to the family alcoholism in the opposite manner - by being the confrontational one. I've confronted my mother any number of times, and when you are dealing with a parent in denial, no amount of confrontation is going to be helpful or healing. It is actually more damaging to all involved.<br /><br />But Forward presumes that all adult children are \\"people pleasers\\" and that is simply not the case. For someone who has kept their mouth shut their entire lives, maybe confrontation might feel empowering, but even then I just don't think it is a great idea - you could put yourself in physical danger depending on the parent!<br /><br />And that's one of the main problems with this book - Forward has a \\"one-size-fits-all\\" approach based on the assumption that children from different types of dysfunctional homes all react the same way. She covers many different areas of dysfunction (substance abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse) as if she's expert in all of these areas. But it was clear to me from reading her short section on family alcoholism she had little understanding of adult children of alcoholics at the time she wrote her book.<br /><br />In comparison, in the Red Book you are given a \\"Laundry List\\" of how adult children react to family alcoholism. This, too, might seem to be a bit \\"one-size-fits-all,\\" but even in the Red Book it's explained that some people have manifested the \\"Laundry List\\" in an opposite manner. In other words, there's a lot more nuance. And in the Red Book, there's a tremendous amount of insight into the toxic behaviors we learned from our parents. In \\"Toxic Parents,\\" on the other hand, things are overly simplified and the adult children are just hapless victims.<br /><br />There is some helpful advice in \\"Toxic Parents,\\" but you need to take it with a grain of salt. Forward's examples of \\"non-defensive\\" statements actually came off to me as quite defensive (saying \\"You're entitled to your own opinion\\" can come off as VERY rude!). Also, I think Forward is wayyyy off the mark about the power of forgiveness. She confuses surface level \\"forgiveness\\" with true forgiveness, which offers a deep sense of freedom and unconditional love. And as I wrote above, her focus on confrontation is at best, not necessary...most likely, it will incite an emotionally abusive response from the parent and stir up more negative emotions...and at worse, it could be extremely dangerous.<br /><br />Forward is perhaps a bit biased by her own \\"outrage\\" at the abusive parents, but there is also (as another reviewer stated) an undercurrent of superiority in Forward's writing. She thinks she has all the answers. When a client of hers leaves the therapy, it's because the client was \\"threatened\\" by the strong emotions the therapy brought up and \\"ran away\\" from them. Forward never stops to consider that perhaps her approach does not work for everyone.<br /><br />Personally, I think this book will be the most helpful for people pleasers who have repressed their anger, versus adult children like myself who have been more than in touch with anger. As far as being helpful in general to adult children of alcoholics, there are better resources out there.<br /><br />For anyone from a dysfunctional family who might be interested in a 12-step approach, by all means - no matter whether you had a parent with an alcohol issue or not - get the Adult Children of Alcoholics \\"Red Book.\\" I think that book is much, much better. And it focuses on self-healing vs. blaming the parents, confronting the parents, or otherwise letting the parents be the focus.
0446693804|3.0|A Walk to Remember is one of my favorite movies, so I was excited to read the book.  I love to read Nicholas Sparks, and have read a lot of his books.  I was really surprised to find that there are a lot of differences between the movie and the book.  In the movie, there is no mention of an orphanage, but in the book that is a big part of the story.  The book was okay, but I prefer the movie. It was a short book, so I guess they had to add a lot of things to make it into a movie.  Maybe if I had read the book first, and then seen the movie, I wouldn't have been so disappointed.  Usually movies that are written from books follow the story line and characters pretty well.  Unfortunately this one did not.
B004DM0UII|3.0|I like the fact I can listen to music from another country. It its interesting to hear weekday is playing over there
B008O9V4C2|2.0|I have listened to Steely Dan for decades and the music of Becker and Fagan has matured like fine wine,but it disturbs me that the music seems to be stuck in a rut.<br /><br />Nothing new or innovative in years from some incredibly talented people.<br /><br />Unfortunately this album is just more of the same.<br /><br />Even their usual impeccable recording sounds flat and uninteresting.<br /><br />While the music reminds me figuratively of being wrapped in a warm blanket on a cold winters day,there seems to be a pseudo junkie comfort that has settled into their style.<br /><br />Steely Dan was born out of a novel written by a junkie and references in their songs to opioids abound(Morph(ine) the Cat?).<br /><br />I think they have chased the dragon one to many times and maybe it's time for them to sober up.
1451673442|5.0|This is an awesome practice as it shifts your attention from daily routines to daily appreciation and gratitude for everything.
B000E5N62U|3.0|Given the Dan's hero worship of junkies,didn't anybody get the not so subtle reference of the album?<br /><br />Chasing the dragon and deriving ones name from a book written by a hard core junkie may suggest that maybe these boys got a genuine habit?
B00APUYWYA|1.0|Saw the preview, seemed decent and the ratings were high.  I stopped watching midway through.  The story was weak, character development pretty poor and until I saw the movie realized I don't like a capella singing. The riff off scene was really geeky.
B0091LS07E|5.0|I love Alicia Keys, she has an incredible voice and her music is suitable to play in my salon.<br />I have a couple other CD's by her.

B009MO5960|5.0|I'm  a big resident evil fan. I have the other movies in the series and most of the games. I think this movie kind of strayed away from it's origins, but I like it. It's very action packed. If you like over the top action you'll like this. It arrived on time and in good condition.
B003EYDTY8|5.0|This was a great movie.  I've seen the one with the other actors and this set of actors were the best fit.  they made the cartoon characters come to life.  Story was great old Scooby-Doo story!

B003TSEEDY|3.0|Actually I had expected more. It was an alright book but I wouldn't really suggest it as a read. I also personally am not a big fan of the diary format. Not a long book.
B007SGM084|5.0|Definitely 5 stars.  It is not for the timid.  It has a great story line that makes it almost impossible to put down.
B008B8DY2O|5.0|Great book, very long, doesn't get boring. I just don't like reading gruesome stuff, and there was quite a bit in here. It covered humour and romance and action.

0143145088|1.0|didn't like the material...it is the same material that we have had access to always, nothing new.  I also hated the reading style of the author.  I will be returning.  Hated it.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|Currently an awesome show! I love the whole story and how there are so much secrets. It just keeps me interested and the whole mystery of Alison's death and how everyone is connected. Just a very awesome series and I would recommend it to all my friends.
B004KZOWEG|4.0|Very interesting and important history is provided.  How do our supposedly advanced societies keep producing people who can conceive and implement such callous viciousness against their fellow humans?  However , I felt that the latter portion of the book was extraneous and detracted from the story of what happened in the Congo.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|The game was ok with a interesting story line. It was unique enough to keep me in the game. Puzzles were not to hard. The game as while seemed kind of short.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|I don't like how it freezes up when I click the mushroom. they need to fix that please. it irritates me. over than that, great game.
0525423656|4.0|I don't know what it is about this series, but I love it. I know that a lot people think that it is boring or they just dislike the idea of it. And that could be one of the reasons why I like it so much. I went into read this series with very low expectations. I figured that I wouldn't like it either. However, I love these books.<br /><br />I liked Crossed way better than Matched. I love how it was told in both Cassia and Ky's point of views. That just made me love Ky even more. I feel truly sorry for the situations that they are in. The first part of the book went super-fast for me. I couldn't put it down until I knew that Cassia would find Ky again. They finally reunite and it was lovely! I love the whole relationship between Ky and Cassia.<br /><br />We get to meet some new characters, Indie, Eli, and Vick. I loved them all. I was never that suspicious of Indie till I got to see her through Ky's point of view. I like Indie, even if she did steal from Cassia in the beginning. I am sensing another component to the love triangle: Indie + Xander! Cassia even said toward the ending, \\"You like Xander?\\" That will be totally awesome to see in the next book!<br /><br />One of the plot lines that I loved in this book was Xander's secret. Totally wasn't expecting that at all. It drove me nuts trying to figure it out! At first I wasn't that sure if Ky even knew what it was, but now I realize he was just acting like that in front of Indie. The Rising is mentioned throughout the whole book. We also get to learn a little bit more about the Society and about the outer provinces. That was all interesting at times, but it felt like information overload at times.<br /><br />A thing that I didn't understand in this book was why Ky was so resistant about going to the Rising? Was it because Ky's dad was a part of the Rising and it destroyed his family? That never made sense to me. What was he expecting to do after they escaped? Just live in that empty village, where all the farmers were killed? I was curious to what would have happen if Cassia would have went to the Rising and he didn't come. Would he have seriously stayed there? I am happy that it didn't turn out like that. If anyone knows why Ky didn't want to do it, please leave a comment. Maybe I skimmed that part or forgot that I read it.<br /><br />I am so excited for the next book. I am kind of sad to see the story end, and I hope that it would be told from all three points of view this time. It would be interesting to see things from Xander, along with Ky and Cassia. That is what I am hoping for. I also believe that Indie is going to be in the mix with Xander. Overall, I really enjoyed this book.re killed?

B00AC8ZJPQ|4.0|It's a shame this comments box has a quota on words  because I think my ttle says it all for this movie.  I saw the webisodes and was immediately captured.  I stopped playing Halo after Halo 1.  Seeing the movie and knowing little to nothing about the history of the Master Chief, This movie just drew me into the genre and wanting to know more about the program the Master Chief went through to become the Chuck Norris of FPS.

B00005O3VC|5.0|Unlike the majority of the Monty Python sketches and movies, this movie has *mostly* clean and appropriate humor to it, without losing any quality. It makes an excellent gift for any Monty Python, or general comedy, lover. If you haven't seen it yet, I would reccommend renting it before purchasing it, because, while it is glorious, it is not for everyone.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like it a lot. the art is very realistic. nothing like the real thing but it is a video game. cant expect too much.
B00136Q784|5.0|great cd!this is what happens when you put 3 seattle grunge bands together,the two majors being AIC and pearl jam river of deceit is the shiner on it,but great overall cd ,must have for fans
B0015DROBO|5.0|...once the foundation for the series was laid, the story kicks into high gear. It was difficult to get thru the first 45% of the book (on my Kindle) and it wasn't easy to keep track of some of the characters, with so many with the last name of Vanger, but I'm so glad I kept plodding through it. It's great to read a book with a quirky intelligent geeky girl as the main character. I can't wait to dig into the next two books in the series!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|is a really fun and challenging game love it would be better if u could earn hints but still is a good game
B004QX07G4|3.0|I love Ellen, but I was disappointed in this book. It's just more of her humor and humorous look at life. I was hoping for more of a biography of Ellen, which it is not.

B003B02O14|4.0|I thought The Partner was cleverly written full of suspense, twists, and turns.  My only complaint is that I did not like the ending.  Although it was a huge surprise and went with the flow, I would have appreciated something different.
B004HO6I4M|4.0|came on time and in great condition. great kids movie; lots of colors and music. as always a good disney story line. i got it to see luis the bulldog.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|A lot different than the movie. But most books are. The closer I got to the end the more I started liking it. I like that it was a romance. There's a couple more books after this so surprised they killed everybody off. Anxious to see what the rest of the books are about.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Stephen King does not need my endorsement to sell books, but he'll get it anyway.  Good story. Icouldn't wait to get to the next page.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was a great read. One that you dont want to put down. Very very good story line, beautiful characters. Grabs your heart and doesn't let go.
B0064W63XG|4.0|Being a large fan of Moore's, I went in with high expectations. I'm happy to say that this stands up with his great works such as v for vendetta, or the killing joke. Be forewarned however, this doesn't surpass the likes of watchmen, as it isn't nearly as thought provoking or well written. That is an extremely high standard to set however, and this excels in a different way. It's ridiculously entertaining, and strikingly imaginative. I could recommend it to anyone who's a fan of classic novels, including the works of it h.g. wells, Arthur Conan Doyle, Jules Verne, etc, and anyone who's into steampunk art. The books illustrations range from simplistic beauty, to strikingly stunning and epic battle scenes. The art is subtle and always complements the writing style and settings of the story.The book beautifully captures these interesting characters in a snapshot that would probably satisfy even their original creators. The JLA format works great as these characters and their distinct personalities grow on you. By the end of the book you feel as patriotic for England as you would for 'MERICA at the end of a good captain America story line. One warning however. I simply can't recommend this book if you haven't heard of any of the characters in the description. Most of the fun comes from seeing these classic characters interact with each other, and eventually forming something amazing. The whole point of this book is to fulfill the dreams of any guy who was forced to read these dusty old novels in high school, and wondered what would happened they made a justice league circa 1898.it's extra special however of your like me. And actually love these classic stories. Which makes it twice as special when you see these extraordinary gentlemen come together. In the end this book is absurdly entertaining and is highly recommended by me.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I really loved reading Jaycee's story about her 18 year captivity.  I have 2 daughters so it gave me another reason to hold them closer than ever, thinking about what creeps are out there and what some humans are capable of doing to another.

B00A8ECU24|5.0|The first time I played this was on a friend's iPod. It seemed boring because he had a fully functioning little town.<br />I put this on my Kindle HD, and haven't regretted it since. The concept was easy to understand, the controls were simple to pick up, and the overall theme just fits. The music is alright if you've got nothing else to do, but I like to put on some heavy metal while playing this. Just for the contradictory feeling that puts a smile on my face.<br />Overall, I'm pleased with the game. It's a wonder why they don't make people pay a dollar for this. It'd be worth it.
0307341577|5.0|It is very difficult to make a reader like a book when the reader does not like the heroine. This book is so well written, it is the only time that I have ever seen it done. By the end of the book, you kinda sorta like her, but you still wouldn't start a fan club for her. Flynn is the most talented author that I have ever seen and I am an avid reader.<br />The twist and turns are impossible to even guess who the murderer might be. And that is a difficult feat to accomplish. I will definitely read anything I can get a hold of by this author.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|The ending surprised me! I can't wait to see if this movie coming out in February will do the book justice!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follet is a wonderful author.  This  is a great series and a history lesson to boot! I can't wait for the next book.
B007KZY1YY|2.0|I chose a rating of two stars because the language and events were very repetitive. The entire story of events could have been written in a third of the pages and still would have been complete. The series could have been written as a sex manual. Even so, still repetitive unless the reader has trouble with retentive memory and needs to be told the moves over and over again..
B0087JTAKW|4.0|This is a fascinating concept of time.  i enjoyed it, but  don't  know of I would recommend it to anyone
0345803485|1.0|I read this book because it got so much attention. What a waste of time. There must be a lot of uptight housewives who aren't getting any that gave this a good review. If you want to read a romance novel there are LOTS of better choices. If you want to read erotica, there's a wide choice to choose from that are also better. The writing is horrible. I got to the point I was ready to scream every time the main character said &#34;oh my.&#34;  (72 times another reviewer says!) Don't waste your time on this one.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was really good all the way through, but the last chaapter is amazing.  This book stays with you for a long time,
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game! My son and I love finding out what new dragons we can breed. The only real money I have spent on this game is when we were too impatient to wait for our first couple of bred eggs to hatch.
B004H4XI5O|4.0|I read this book to improve my memory and it did help.  There were some good suggestions that I try to use.
B00ARN0WBW|2.0|In the fourth installment of paranormal activity we finally get to see what happens to Katie and Hunter. We also get to same some of the annoying questions answered. That is where the movie falls short. This movie tells basicly no information on The questions left us in the movies. It seems like they wanted to leave it so open that they decided not to give any information. The time however was not replaced with any extra scary scenes. In fact there was only one or two scary scenes in the movie.  The rest of the movie was filler scenes. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Even a huge fan of the franchise can see they have nothing more left to do and are just doing it for the money.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I really loved this book.  I understand so much more about World War 1 now. Ken Follett  does it again.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I like the way this game run .it's a great game. you should be able to see more of the town
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love having this app on my phone.  The most accurate weather information by far!  Easy to navigate.  Two thumbs up!
B008FYZIVY|1.0|I was so excited to get this DVD set but was so quickly disappointed. The quality was terrible. It was all grainy and the sound cut in and out. DVD looked like it was boot-legged or something. Thank goodness for Amazon's quick return and<br />recredit policy. I don't feel so duped now. Also, I had pre-ordered the Season 3 which was supposed to ship in Feb. Decided to cancel that as well. Too bad.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I love this game because its fun and you get to be really creative. It's my favorite  of all the Angry Bird games - and I love all the Angry Bird games!
B004X4QW42|5.0|Donnie makes a very convincing and likeable Yip Man character. So sorry he called it quits with IM2! I really liked the first one better. Killing off Sammo Hung's character was not a plus for me! Sammo's one of my favorite MA actors!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|AMAZING read! Finished in a day as the page turner allows you to piece together chronologically the broken fragments of the past to reveal secrets unbeknownst to Sky. Fate brings Holden to Sky and we see how their lives intertwined give larger meaning to star crossed lovers and confidants. Bittersweet and strong back story that touches on many social issues of the day which makes it relatable to readers from many demographics. Kudos to Ms Hoover, great compelling novel!!
B003INBNXO|5.0|A little on the violent/graphic side as far as MA films go, but tied in with a meaningful theme (the Japanese occupation, etc.). It makes for a great story line even if the real Yip Man didn't exactly go through the persecution the movie character did.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I read reviews and watched videos and really considered buying this knife before I actually bought it. I love the thought of an invincible, unbreakable blade in a nightmare scenario and I wouldn't expect this knife to break. As a pry bar or hammer it would perform wonderfully. But I also want a blade that functions as a knife should, sharp and clean cuts through whatever material it may need to cut through. I wanted something that would be both a pry bar and a razor blade. This knife is not that knife. Mine came dull right out of the box. Couldn't pass the paper or the hair shaving test. Just tore the paper with sheer weight and ripped the hairs out of my arms a little, barely. I was given a Johnson Adventure Potbelly as a gift and man, that thing was sharp and thick. A pry bar and a razor blade. I definitely recommend going with that over the BK2 if you are in the market for a knife and not just a hammer/crowbar. I still love Kabar, though.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I like the story in the film and ( as allways) the action is good in it too!, get it!
B00001W9G0|5.0|I have always loved this movie it is one of my favorite love stories of all time.  It never gets old for me.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|The flim is good, but how much of batman can one take? see for yourself and you deceide. ok? ok!
B003JTHXOK|2.0|I loved this book... I couldnt put the book down ..I read this book in 2 days!!!! Nicholas Sparks is my favorite author and all his books are amazing but this book i just couldnt stop reading!!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love subway surfers!! I kept waiting for it to come to the kindle fire because it always crashed on my iPod. I love the new version with the NYC theme and my favorite part is the option for double coins!  My only complaint is for an amateur gamer like me it it hard to collect a ton of money for cool characters. Overall you guys did a great job with this game.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I was too young to serve in world war two but did join the AAF in mid 1946 by lying about my age.  I was very angry at the Germans as I lost one brother in the Battle of the Bulge and had a second brother in the same battle that survived and went on to fight in several other engagements.  He returned home a changed man.  A third brother served in the Navy Seabee's on Attu.  I wanted to go to Germany to somehow express my anger to the German people who allowed a Hitler and his henchmen to seduce an entire population and cause such atrocities and devastation in Europe and elsewhere.  Instead I was sent to Japan and served in the occupation of Japan.  But my anger toward the German people has lasted all these years since the war.  When I read &#34;The Higher Call&#34; and came to understand that there was a segment of the German population of ordinary citizens that opposed both the nazi party and the war itself, I felt a softening of my feeling of anger.  I knew of the German military revolt and attempted assasination of Hitler, but that was by high ranking officers only.  The book explains how some of the German fighting troops and citizens were very much against the nazi party and the war.  People who lived through WWII, and to the younger population who are interested in those years, I highly recommend reading this book.  Although most of the story concerns fighting, it shows that there was still honor shown in combat.<br />Paul D. Smith
B004DMNT2W|5.0|I am giving five stars for this item because of its quality-it is realy well made case. I like the shape, the way it fit to my camcoder and possibility to keep all my necesery accessory.
0312576463|4.0|Review by Donn G. Ziebell, Ph.D., Never kicked by a horse nor a mule, and author of the non-fiction Amazon book,\\"My Letters to a Prisoner -- I had not met\\". Become an insider to the humor and private life of the writer's encounters and adventures home and abroad; a selection from over 100 letters written in six years.<br /><br />Patty and Walters marriage and home life seems quite blissful. Then some unusual encounters and personal interactions begin to happen that reshape the landscape. The landscape further warps when Patty's parents and siblings impact Patty's development as a child growing up, which understandably follows right on her heels. Trying to fit cause and effect of events within the book becomes an automatic attraction.<br /><br />The twists and turns of a parade of personalities made the name \\"Woody Allen\\" fly through my head a number of times. I began to wonder how many readers began to suspect author Jonathan Franzen had been peeping and listening at the outside window sills of the character's home. It was quite a book that provided for a very lively discussion within our reading club. Other clubs would enjoy this Amazon book.
B004NOCCEG|4.0|Have seen many documentaries on this subject and each one focused on a different aspect of the crisis and some were more in depth.  But I felt Inside Job was a great overview and in true documentary form - which is to present facts that occurred, not personal bias.  I appreciated how they did not infuse political opinion as well, they just presented the facts and allow each person to form their own conclusions.  Well done.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|hi I am webber I think this is a decent game. I recmend it.I would have liked to have known more about the eivl one .
B003L7DK74|5.0|My son loved this.  It was a Christmas present.<br />He couldn't wait to watch it.  What a mom I am!
B00797MB0O|2.0|A few funny moments but just a sort of boring dark comedy. Best thing in this film in Charlize Theron acting however the plot needed alot of work.
1451695195|4.0|This man tells it as it was.....non-theatrical style of relating his experience as it occurred.  Admits to both its joys and fears, and takes all the memories and emotions that he remembers and records them in a book....this is a difficult task putting them into text.  The fact that his knowledge, being a neurosurgeon, balances the scientific with the spiritual, makes this book both understandable and believable.  Anyone who has had doubts about the afterlife will think again after reading this book.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game can be quite hilarious and entertaining! No artistic ability required.Need to fix bug in purchasing bombs, but otherwise I would say this is an awesome game!!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|One of my favorite books, \\"World War Z\\" grabbed me in a way few stories have. I love zombies, but I think it's horribly unfair to write this off as \\"another zombie book.\\" It's so very much more. Yes, there are zombies, lots of them, but this isn't their story. If anything, it's a human story and an exploration of what humanity is capable of when pushed. The best and worst of human nature is highlighted. The zombies are not the villains in this book, they merely are. They are a catalyst, a foil to compare and contrast living people against, and sometimes the zombies were the less evil of the two.<br /><br />I recommend this story to anyone who loves good fiction. Even if you aren't a zombie fan per se, give it a try. You may be surprised.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have enjoyed watching this series. Had fun re-watching season 1 and 2 to make sure I haven't &#34;missed anything&#34; and get ready for Season #3. One of the few good things on TV... way to go PBS and Amazon!
B000FC1192|4.0|Coraline is a clever, adventurous girl who is wise beyond her years. When the bricked up corridor off the drawing room in her flat suddenly leads to another another flat that looks oddly like hers, with parents somewhat like hers but not quite, Coraline's normal adventures take a more ominous turn.<br /><br />I greatly enjoyed this otherworldly tale of a young girl's journey to get back to her real, if less than perfect, life and help others along the way.
B0010SKSTO|5.0|This is an entertaining and insightful read, and shows how much some of us miss in what is being said around us every day.  If you're only looking at faces for communication, you're missing too much.  I do wonder how many folks will use the information to better read others, and how many will use it to better manipulate others.
B000FC13Y0|5.0|A beautiful and imaginative romp through a magical world where the improbable can happen and love prevails. Fairies, witches, a lost kingdom, and a fallen star.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I was disappointed. Seemed like a formula novel with very little effort expended. The plot twists were contrived and superficial and the characters were simplistic. I expect more, maybe too much, from Grisham. It's worth a read because it's not boring or completely stupid but try and find in used or at the library. You don't want to encourage this quality by spending your good money for it.
B000SEFNMS|3.0|The main character makes me extremely angry - his arrogance and hubris is off the charts and it is ridiculous to me that anyone could consider him a hero for his actions when all I can see in him is a petulant, willful child - but the story itself is well written.
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|With all the wonderful apps they have, this app is wonderful and is instantly by far the best app that doesn't require to be logged into to view or to share, like other apps. We have had a lot of fun sharing our video's with friends and family. This app is free today! This app usually costs $4.99 - You'll be glad you did.
B00338QENI|5.0|A great book.  I can't belive but do believe that things like this happened all those years ago and hopefully this never happens again.
0525478817|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone...young adult or adult. John Green has captured the cancer experience well. Also seems to know how a young person thinks.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I didn't have a clue what this book was about but it was highly recommended.  I thought the book was really well written but an awful subject.
0142501123|5.0|By reading it our first time it became my 2 year old and my favorite. Even with it not having the sentence everyone else is complaining about. We never read the other version and I guess I'm happy we didn't. We got to enjoy this one as a masterpiece.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.  I do a lot of reading and this was very interesting and I would read other books by this author.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love this trilogy. I have read all three books three times already. It is too good that you will not be able to put it down...
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Really an exciting read.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I enjoy reading Clancy.  A book I couldn't put down.
B000TX7B5U|5.0|The music was everything I expected and more, I enjoyed the orchestra and acoustic background and where most songs built up to a crescendo and then a lull.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|I bought this to connect my Panasonic TV to my stereo system, it works excellent without any distortion.. Had to purchase digital optical cable separate.
B0050R0YB8|3.0|If more protection inside for the box will be better. Anyway, I still feel the packing OK with this time.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham carries you through with a logical idea and then .......the twist changes everything. It shows the trait of a good writer...I have read all his novels. This rates up there near the top. I would probably go with a 4 1/2 stars if that was available. The ending in print was a little slow but would make a good movie ending.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I read the book after I saw the movie and I now I understand why everyone was soo hyped up about it. I couldn't put the book down. I can't wait to read the next two!!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|To say I really like whatever Tom Clancy writes is an understatement!  I can't wait until a new book is released.  I enjoyed reading Threat Vector very much but was a little disappointed about how Jack Jr. and Melanie ended up.  Seemed like a too quick rap up on that thread.  Otherwise, another masterful, well researched novel!
B000001GXJ|5.0|The conventional wisdom is that there are two great recorded \\"Boccanegras\\" -- the 1957 Gobbi/Christoff/Santini account and the 1976 Cappuccilli/Ghiaurov/ Abbado account.  They are both very fine, and the much better sound on the more recent recording tips the balance to Abbado.  The sound-world of the opera is quite distinctive, and EMI's 1955 mono sound doesn't do it justice, even though in other respects it's perfectly acceptable.  Abbado also brings a bit more dramatic expressivity to the score than Santini.  As far as the singers are concerned, though, there are no weak links in either set.  Walter Monachesi is a very positive Paolo, even if the voice lacks some of the glamor of Jose Van Dam's.  Jose Carreras likewise has more glamor than Campora, and he also sings more ardently.  Carreras never sang better than he sang in the 1970's.  Campora, though, sings very well.  Ghiaurov has a wonderful sound, and his low notes are secure, but he sounds a bit gusty in the higher-lying long lines.  Christoff has a marvelous gravelly sound, but he's rock-solid throughout.  There are two fine Amelias in De los Angeles and Freni, and two excellent Boccanegras in Gobbi and Cappuccilli.  The latter has never sung a dramatic role better.  Gobbi is Gobbi -- distinctive of voice and, in this role, poignant of accent, a great assumption.  Ideally, serious Verdi lovers need both of these great recordings.
B003CI90MQ|5.0|The book is just as straight to the point as it claims. I think it helps if you read a chapter right before you go out and shoot (especially landscapes). I also appreciate the gear finder portion because he is realistic about what you like to have, want, and need.
B00000J048|5.0|My four-year old grandson was immediately drawn to this toy.  He liked all the possiblities; he liked the cause and effect.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|How Batman should be seen. Grafic and dark. Really good movie, can't wait to see part 2 and see how it ends with the Joker and Superman.
0316212377|4.0|Nothing below should stop you from reading this book :). It IS a Banks culture novel, after all.<br />Some great elements, the sonata, the main protagonist, the culture minds, and some great set pieces, especially the battle scenes.<br />But... SPOILERS<br />They didn't really come together as more than the sum of their parts.  Lot's of action, but no result.  There was no real ending.<br />Also I couldn't suspend my disbelief over a few things.  The almighty minds squabble and talk like children.  I know there is a lot if self-deprecating irony in their communication, but I never got the sense of them being any less petty than humans.<br />The sublimation.  How was that society ready to sublime?  It seemed, aside from technologically, in no way advanced from our own.
B00846REIS|4.0|Sylvia Day wrote a good tale of two people discovering each other's idiosyncrasies.  I did want to occasionally murder Eva, but then there would be no rest of the story!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I watched the first two seasons of Downton Abbey (free through Amazon Prime) in one weekend! Great characters, great story line, and no commercials! I can't wait for the full season (3) to be available.
B0084I9QLY|5.0|I bought this record after buying the Thriller [Vinyl] to get more of my favorite MJ songs: Smooth Criminal, Man In the Mirror, Dirty Diana, The Way You Make Me Feel and Bad. It's a great album and I would very much recommend it.<br /><br />Also what is cool, like the Thriller album, this too is a picture disc.
B007WKEM8C|5.0|One of the most useful and ENTERTAINING cookbooks I've ever read, and I've read a lot of cookbooks. Great sounding recipes- the two I've made so far (pizza dough and apple cake) were wonderful.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Castle is one of the best written crime/ comedy ever. The interaction between the leads Castle and Beckett is believable and fun.
B009HNDCC4|5.0|Great to see a show that's just good honest entertainment! Love it! Good for the whole family! Best show on tv by far
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Read my First season review same only the cast is getting tighter and even better. You will love the entire series.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Excellent! Entertaining from start to finish. Easily accessed direction available for those of us that keep playing even while half asleep.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I have just found this author and have to read the rest of the books.  Her descriptions of WWII London were fascinating.  The reader searched for answers to a family mystery along with the main character.  The twist at the end was a surprise...just the way a mystery should!
B004QX07G4|5.0|I am halfway through the book and it is like listening to Ellen on TV. So if you enjoy Ellen on TV then you will love her book.My rating stands - I was not kidding.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  The descriptions of WWI era England and life as a servant were interesting enough to keep me going.  There was enough mystery and twists in the plot to provide an enjoyable read.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This book was great!  Storytelling at it's best. Great editing, focus, characterization, etc., The only negative is the fact there is no follow-up and with the ending it seems there is/was one to be, where is it?
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Love this show, looked great HD but to expensive to buy all in hd.  very intense show. and surprise ending
B008VSKPJO|5.0|Imelda is one cool singer.  Great sound that spans blues, rockakbilly, and 40s.  The instrumentation works well with the vocals to bring a kind of retro and modern sound all at the same time.  For discerning music listeners, this is a must have.
B00A4TKDKY|5.0|My husband is a huge fan and introduced me to him.  He is one of a few who are as good live as in the studio in terms of an album/CD.  I would rather be in a club or at a concert to hear it live... but this is good.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|The twists and turns of this book keep you guessing. I would highly recommend this series. Can't wait to read next book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Enjoyed it more than the first book in the trilogy, can't wait to read the third!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play this game every day its so addicting if you want a time waster this is the game for you I bet its so funnn
B000031XBQ|5.0|Lived in the late seventies in South America and remembered Abba's version of Chiquita in Spanish playing on the radio constantly.  Also contains Spanish versions of many of their hits like Dancing Wueen, Fernando, Thank You For the Music, etc.
B00005AWMF|5.0|She has such a smooth voice, and a great way of singing her songs.  Loved it.  She is truly talented.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great acting, fascinating glimpse at the social structure of the times, intelligently written and good story threads to give intrigie
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|I heard one song on a commercial and it was etched into my soul. So I hunted down the singer and found Lana Del Rey. I can't place the reason but her voice just makes me want to close my eyes and listen. It's like a siren singing a song to ease your soul. It doesn't matter if the song is about soda, jeans or paradise because I am addicted.
B005KDWUFA|5.0|Another gift and the recipient is a very devoted fan of Il Divo, has several recording ot this group. They loved it and listen to it frequently.  EH
B003NX76BM|3.0|Believe it or not, this is the first Nora Roberts book I have ever read.  I had heard how great her books were so I gave it a try.  And while I did not think it was great, it was a good read.  I think it had a good plot and liked the main character, Fiona.  She was strong and determined and very likeable.  However, I did not care for Simon, the new man in her life.  I thought he was brusque and boorish and a bit of an jerk although he did have some redeeming qualities.  Being a huge dog lover and a volunteer at our local humane society, I thoroughly enjoyed the fact that Fiona was a dog trainer and trained dogs and their owners for search and rescue.  I liked the times that they actually had to search for people.<br /><br />The ending was a big letdown.  You have a build up throughout the book of the serial killers and how the copy cat is moving closer to Fiona, but the ending was anti-climactic and left me wanting more.  I felt there were loose ends left that could have been tied up and explained better.  For that reason and the character of Simon, I would give this a 3.5.  All in all though, it was a pretty good book and I will read more books by Nora Roberts.  I think I'll start with some of her first books, though, especially those with an Irish theme.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Beware! Before you begin reading this one, you will soon find yourself reading the second and third sequels. So you better just download all three right now!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I picked this up as a gift and the image quality is fantastic, could not be happier. Series is addicting so beware.
B003UBTX72|5.0|Loved this book and reading about Keith's story! You see a different side of him: an intelligent, musical genius side of him.
B002NJWHHA|1.0|I suppose that if I had not read the entire series, this might get a 3. But dude, SERIOUSLY, the number of errors and lazy reorganizations meant to turn this into a convenient, popularly accessible film, were just too numerous to ignore. Will NEVER watch this again. Shame on you, whoever wrote this adaptation.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Now you know how they met in first sequel, this takes you on a journey of their relationship.  You get to know Christian Gray in this one!
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|well maybe just me but I don't see bad in it yet. I don't even have a way for dlna or allshare yet. from what I see I can even like watch full movies they have...one had subtitles in some non English language...so what though and language was English. yeah there was a  sign in for Facebook which I don't have but also a skip for that. whole lots crying about nothing really. ugh, time for a bottle people or maybe a nap...get over it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Of course, this last sequel has to be read if you read the first two to find out what happened, and it doesn't disappoint!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|My teenage daughter was wondering what book I was reading that I didn't want to be interrupted.  When I was done with the book, she read it and didn't want to be interrupted either!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book disturbed me for quite a while after reading it, to think there are such evil people in this world. I loved it because she was able to escape and tell her side.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I wish I could say it made a believer out of me. Worth reading, just not very convincing. His description of heaven was much like dreaming, not proof of anything.
B00005JKNC|5.0|A great film about a man caught up in the Communist Witch Hunt! Amnesiac due to a car crash, he is mistaken for dead War hero and welcomed into a community!  SO heartwarming.....I loved it!
0312427573|5.0|So, I am finally reading this book by Tom Wolfe; my sister just highly recommended to me \\"The Electric Koolaid Acid Test\\", which I ordered at my library to read.  Glad I found \\"Bonfire\\" on the shelf in the meantime, and to have finally started on Tom Wolfe.  OMG, I am so glad I am finally reading this novel.  It is beyond sophisticated and beyond hilarious (any author who makes me bust out laughing like a hyena anyway I know immediately is wonderful); what an indictment of so much of the culture and style of the '80's.  Reading this novel, I think I am able to see so much (good) about the author - his culture, humor, intellect and thinking, just shining through this brilliant novel.  Especially if you have grown up on the East Coast, you immediately get the style and sophistication of this writing (maybe somewhat similar too I think to the great detective writing of someone like Raymond Chandler (?).  Anyway, I do not want this book to end, I am so entranced; I am LOVING Tom Wolfe!
0783116934|5.0|An HBO Production, a thrill ride about a real serial killer in the Soviet Union and the real life cop who was tasked with catching him in a system that refused to admit they could have a Serial Killer!  A stellar cast, Stephen Rea is awesome, Donald Sutherland too and many others!

I love the way it snaps it and doesn't cut off any of the screen or frame of the Fire. The case also nicely stands up which makes it so convenient for watching  films or reading on flights. I highly recommend it.
6305327084|5.0|A great cast, a nice story about a bunch of late twenty-early thirty somethings from a smallish town getting together for their 10th year High School reunion. A great role for very young Natalie Portman, as always.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Legal mystery thriller with a killer twist at the end!  One of those books that's so good you're sorry when you finish it.
B0012TWRAO|5.0|This is just one of many RAM products I have gathered over the past year.  THe products are solid and are really the only ones that I trust to protect my GPS while riding my bike.  I bought this as a base accessory for my seond bike so that I can switch the main unit between bikes with ease.  Great product!
B00992CF6W|5.0|awesome! but after the 2 monthes of having it ALL MY WORLDS DISSAPEARED WICH REALLY SUCKED!!!! Ps I use kindle fire
B008602KQI|3.0|Either I am getting older, or the movie stars are getting younger.  I'm sure it is both, but looking back on the classics like Indiana Jones and etc. I think the movie stars seemed more mature.  Maybe it is just my persecption.  That said, I liked the movie fine, but it is a movie driven towards younger audiences.  The cast reminded me of the new vampire movies.  Decent storyline and concept, but not the greatest acting.  I thought the main actress did a great job, but the rest of the cast were too teeniebopperish.  It is worth one look, but I wouldn't recommend buying it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is great. It is very entertaining and I even laughed. If you love Diary of a Wimpy Kid, I recommend this to you.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Could not put this book down...Kate Morton is wonderful.  A wonderful twist is to be discovered.  Keep up the good work Kate
B005I6EVUG|5.0|My Kindle Fire is used frequently and the last cover I had on it started fraying at the edges, so I ordered this one from the Vine program to replace it.<br /><br />This is a well-made cover and feels rich and luxurious. The case fits the Fire tightly. And the left side includes a pocket. Pockets are important to me! I like to make occasional notes or lists of things to find or to read in sequence and having a pocket to hold the list is a good benefit. And occasionally I like to make a \\"paper\\" note for use later.<br /><br />I recommend this cover highly! If you use your Fire daily or frequently you will find this cover easy to use and a nice compliment to the Fire.
B00A9C3RNQ|5.0|I loved the movie.  I resemble a lot of it.  The acting was teriffic!  I love Tommy Lee and Meryl.
0470450266|5.0|I've been using Zbrush for less than a year, but this book or anything written by Scott Spencer is an extremely valuable resource. I've been a fan of his work since watching his Gnomon Workshop tutorials.  He explains anatomy to the very last detail and I found myself using this book not only to create realistic looking models, but stylized ones as well. The anatomical foundation can be applied to any humanoid. The videos included with the book are a real help and make it worth buying the paperback rather than the ebook.
B007712XAU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed each episode of Downton Abbey both seasons.  Each episode had so many drama laden relationships and actions happening all at the same time. Each one of them flowed smoothly and help my attention greatly. It was awesome.
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|Must have been very embarrassing for these great actors to see themselves in this very week movie.  Very poor dialogue and very predictable script.  One of the worst I have seen this year.
B005DD7H50|5.0|this is a great movie eyecatching premise and excellent plot development.  builds to exciting and surprising close.  cooper does a great job of weaving the ins and outs of the plot and ties things together.  DeNiro is great as the tough tycoon who gets exactly what he deserves.  Great movie that I've seen twice already.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|My son and I first saw this movie in Maryland during New Years of this year for the first time. The entire time driving 5 hours back home he begged for this movie and asked could he use the money from his piggy bank to buy it. I told him I would find it on Amazon. I found the movie and ordered it. When I told him I had ordered the movie he was excited. He checked the mailbox everyday until it came. He takes pride in purchasing the movie himself and he will not let anyone borrow it. I am happy that he shows genuine compassion about something like this at the age of 3 years old. I love my son and his Real Steel! He and I would also like to thank the company for their great customer service.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Fifty Shades I was the first book I put on my Kindle, I had no idea how sexually explicit it was, I had just heard it was number 1 on the best seller list. Once I got past the shock, I really did enjoy the series and all the twists and turns in the various relationships. When I started Fifty Shades of Gray and realized this was not something I was really comfortable with, I was only going to read the one book as I had paid for it.  The story by far overshadowed the sex and the suspense at the end of I drove me to read II and the suspese at the end of II drove me on to III.<br /><br />I enjoyed III but felt it drug on towards the end and probably could have ended 40 or 50 pages sooner than it did.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|You are the best, Rihanna, and I LOVE YOU. Only P!nk and George Michael come close to your music royalty.. I have every song/album you have dropped and I love every one of them...anxiously awaiting your next song/album.
B0015DROBO|4.0|An exceedingly interesting look at the functionality of media and how warped various means' attitudes towards women are.  Truly disturbing imagery of how violence toward women was exhibited yet shoved under the rug.
0316227706|5.0|what a great book !!... the pictures and the facial expressions are priceless !! Kudos to dogs and photographer !!!
B006O6EOII|5.0|Christmas gift for a 5 yr old- on her Santa list.  Doll so pretty- prettier than the pics when I ordered.  If I were a child, I would collect them!  Excellent packaging also.  For a gift that was a plus.  Thank you!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love the Hunger Games Trilogy. I had read it once but then had too read it again. These books are so greatly executed and then to be able to buy all three at once for less is just perfect.
B0063GORYU|5.0|level one was challenging until i got the hang of it, but now i'm still working level two to try to master.  so, level 3 & 4 must be lulus to work.  it's a good game; i recommend if you like solitaire type games.
B00AYDC5HY|2.0|Very simplistic plot.  Enjoyed Despicable Me 100x more.  The animated creatures during the climax were horrible.  Glad I didn't see it in the theater.
0857860801|5.0|Very Funny, Cute Book!! Makes an excellent gift idea for someone. We have really enjoyed reading the Simon's Cat series.
B00164KYV4|5.0|Yes this is a chick flick. However, that doesn't make the lessons in it any less true. Many young women feel like if a man doesn't treat them right that he still likes them; that isn't true. If a man likes you and wants to be with you, he will treat you right. Otherwise, you are a &#34;right now&#34; type of girl. This movie shows how both sexes act around the opposite sex. Normal (yet irrational) behavior that you or your friends have done all of a sudden seem clear. &#34;You are not the exception; you are the rule.&#34;
B00414IXMS|5.0|It's interesting to hear people talk of this album today. When it was released in 85 everyone seemed to be hating on it. It was nothing like Purple Rain, being one of the biggest gripes. Up until then I had only heard Prince on the radio and when I did listen to the vinyl my sister had, I tended to listen to the songs I was most familiar with. So aside from the Purple Rain Hits and 1999/Little Red Corvette my only other foray into his world was Raspberry Beret. A clever and catchy bit of Pop music. It wasn't until around 86 when Parade came out that I actually sat down and listened to a full album (I was stupid, as were many people who only listened to the top 40 and not the whole album) what I found was that Prince, though great with hit singles, was more of an Album artist. Meaning, the best never made it to radio. That isn't to say that the singles weren't great too. Prince's clever lyrics as well as ahead-of-its-time music never failed to caress my imagination. But, as I listened to the whole album I realised how great of a songwriter/musician he really was. The almost Operatic \\"Temptation\\", the almost spiritual Vibe of \\"Around the World in a Day\\" and the awesome storytelling of the title track all add to the overall glory of the album as well as cemented Prince's place as rock royalty.<br /><br />It is ironic though that,though this album came nowhere near the height of Purple Rain's sales it did sell rather well (I believer around 3 Million).And those who hated it (as it was a drastic departure from Purple Rain) now love it. It is not considered a classic, up there with Sign O' the Times (My all-time favorite album). Do not get me wrong it deserves such a high honor, but where were these people when it mattered? ATWIAD as well as Parade made me really understand what Prince was all about..so by the time SOTT came out, I was already a huge fan, and that album blew me away. Condition of the heart,with its long intro, is still as poignant as it was when I first heard it. The lush arrangements, the lyrics, the vocals all work together to bring to life the story he's telling. Songs like Tamourine are playful and fun to listen to. America, with it's tease of an opening (which is lost on today's cd only or download only crowd) was a great tribute to our great country (and also a song my dad loved..as at the time he pretended not to like Prince (he was a huge Elvis fan) but I could tell he liked the concept/lyrics of the song, but it was the first time he admitted it openly.<br /><br />Raspberry Beret was a fun song to listen to, though it does get overplayed on the radio (even today) and Pop life is also a great song, and was one of the first songs I listened to on a boom box (I was 16 at the time) and I loved the stereo effect. And the Ladder was a great piece of Pop-Gospel and a grand piece of storytelling. Overall the album seems rather unifying. But, I am not the type to judge an album based on a theme. as most prince songs sound so different, that you never know what to expect, so except for his soundtrack albums and this one, usually a regular prince album is a great collection of sounds. I love the fact that he doesn't sound like Purple Rain on this album, I have Purple Rain and can listen to it anytime I want, so I want music to be different from each album to the next. But, even though his albums are rather disperate one unifying theme is great music. I just wish this album would have gotten the credit it deserved back in the day, instead of being considered a classic in hindsight. this album is basically the one where Prince found out who his fans were and who would follow him on his musical journey. Anyone can be a fan of Purple Rain as it was a mega-success and people will always say they love the album of the day just because everyone was buying it, not because they really loved it. But those who bought this album and stayed with Prince were the ones he could trust to be open for new sounds and ideas. Chances are if you loved this album you understood prince and where he was going. If you didn't, and you just liked Purple Rain, you were pretty much just a radio fan, as so many people were back in the day.<br /><br />Overall if you love music, and you love to challenge yourself then buy this cd..the artwork is fun too (the viny version is the best choice to view the artwork as you'll see more detail and can readily identify the characters from the song...and view the mountains in the back..shaped like a woman lying on her back). This is a great album, not just of the 80s but for anyone who loves great music.
B007JZGIMS|5.0|just got it and very happy with it it is easy to use and tranfer stuff needs more colors to work with i like to change it

B0054JZC6E|3.0|It's way better on the iPad. Because it has way better graphics and the screen is more bigger. So that's what I think
B003O86FMW|4.0|Enjoyed the characters... a little predictable storyline. Kept my interest. Need more excitement. 3rd book will either make or break trilogy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|really. nice. Its very realistic funny and casual .I love to play it on the go espaiclly on trips. nice
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I loved it! Great plot, excellent character development, and it rarely dragged. Kept me interested the entire time and I couldn't put it down.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie it brought back memories of my time in the Navy. Seeing the Missouri in action even though it was just in a science fiction movie was great and left me wanting more.
0062183591|4.0|Before I will address the review, another point I want to mention.<br />I bought the book without reading any prior reviews, because the fact alone that Dan Ariely published a new book made me buy it, as I was very impressed by his book \\"Predictably Irrational\\" and a chance to see him at a two hour lecture of him at my former university. Now that I have read the book I went through the reviews to see what other readers thought about it. What suprised me most was that from the 126 reviews currently posted on this book, 28 (I made the effort to count them) were written by students of a class at Carlow University. They all start with a variation of: I read Dr. Ariely's \\"The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty: How We Lie to Everyone - Especially Ourselves\\" as a student in Carlow University's Master's of Science in Fraud and Forensics [...] course 'Forensic Research and Analysis'.<br />That makes me wonder: What incentive did you students of this class all have to write reviews??? that is almost suspicious.<br /><br />but now to the book:<br />In a row of experiments around a common mathematical test, Dan Ariely and his team tried to figure out the different situations that make us cheat and the extent of cheating. They arrive at the conclusion that we are prone to cheat when we have the chance to do so, but not by a whole lot - until a point where we still could think of ourelves as honest.<br />Following Dan Ariely's way of reasoning, the outcome sounds logic and comprehensible (I will not post his conclusions here to not spoil the moment when you read through the book and see how he unfolds them).<br />Where I struggle though is that the main conclusions of this book hinge on one test and variations of it. I find this problematic, also as the author never really confirms to the reader for what variables he controlls to make sure no other influencing factors bias the outcome. Hence it's hard to judge for the reader that the results of the experiments are really scientifically sound. As a reader, and this also happend to myself, you might feel that the interpreation that is built around the outcome seems logic and convincing and hence trust that the method must be correct as well.<br /><br />Additionally to the interpreation of his behavioural experiments, the author added a few easily comprehensible real life stories. Dan Ariely touches on conflicts of interest that may encourage people to be dishonest. He names dentists, but also academics. The fact that the dentist's income depends on the kind and number of treatments he does, creates a conflict of interest  (patient's wellbeing vs dentist's own pocket). Hence, inherently by being paid in that way, the dentist's and the patient's intestest are not aligned. In his example about conflicts of interests of academics Dan Ariely described that he himself was once tempted to disregard a datapoint of his study because it did not underpin his hypthesis. It's quite understandable that people become biased towards outcomes that stress their wanted result and more prone to disregard or discount those that counter them. In this context he named also the role of experts who were paid by companies for their expert opinions what could lead to them seeing the world through their client's eyes and not being as objective as they should.<br />Dan also touched on people priding themselves with diplomas they have not really achieved. Several examples of this type of cheating have been revealed lately on the news. It seemingly starts with a small lie, and many others come to follow (the what he calls the \\"what-the-hell Effect\\").<br /><br />Dan Ariely based his book very much on his own experience and the interpration of the data of his experiments. I personally would have found it a nice addition if he would have also touched on the more psychological and philosophical aspect of the topic of why people are dishonest.
B005LBYQ6M|5.0|This is one of those books that you read till 3am and then wish you didn't have to go to work the next day so you could finish it!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I am not a angry bird fan, but my son is the king of bird land and he said that is best thing ever having his little bird friends in space!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I love this show. Usually when a show has been on for several years, it gets a little stale or even predictable. Not this one. It some how manages to get funnier over the years. It's been such fun to watch the growth of the characters. Great writers. Great cast. This show is my weekly, not so guilty pleasure!!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I love Google vs Bing and Yahoo and I must have this on everything I own. it just gets the job done!
B006OCM0G0|3.0|This would be a great game but you are not able to access the same updates if you play it on a kindle fire verses smartphone or ipad which sucks.  And you can not log into your I.d. on other devices which sucks!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great time killer. I don't know what else to write so I'm just taking up space here.
B009E3EY4M|3.0|I was so excited about getting this, but the sound is really off and seems like they relied on the hype of the product rather than the production.  I am a huge Zep fan and tried to really like it, but found myself skipping through to the next song since so many songs were tedious to listen to.  Perhaps since I'm not in my 20's any more I'm not as enthralled with the incessant solos.....but hey, I really wanted to like them :( .I did enjoy the booklet though, especially the insight on Jason Bonham and his excitement at been a part of the greatest band in the world, if only for one night!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I'm not sure what to write here because everyone knows Facebook. So, I'm just typing to fill in the word requirement.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|The case is made of cheap plastic and broke within 2 weeks. It is not a real life proof case.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I don't know why this game is so addicting, but it is. Once you get to the higher levels and reach higher coin totals, you won't be able to put it down.
B0041KVYIW|5.0|This is excellent sound, and great quality. It shipped fast and was at my house in about three days! Wow!
B0086700CM|4.0|I downloaded for a friends son. He seemed to enjoy it, so I tried it. It was pretty fun. Good time killer.
B000O59A2K|5.0|Hatari is a hard movie to find! Especially one of good quality, also I love El Dorado, and so did my dad when he opened his gift!
B005HSL626|4.0|Downloaded for a friends kid. It seems like he really enjoyed it. I've never played it myself though so I can't give an accurate review.
B0041KVXLK|5.0|This is excellent sound, and great quality. It shipped fast and was at my house in about three days! Wow!
B0011UJMK2|5.0|This book was hard to read, yet impossible to put down. Compelling writing and the urgent need to know what would happen next kept me up until sunrise to finish it. Some of the subject matter was disturbing; the threat and fear of the plot were brutally realistic. I did not care for the climax, which lacked intensity and imagination compared to the rest of the plot. Otherwise Child 44 is an engaging story and I enjoyed reading it. I was more impressed with the evident skill of the author at storytelling than with the tale being told.
B0079J28NW|5.0|Excellent quality to an excellent classic that every beatles needs to have. Totally worth it, and it shipped so fast!
B001NHNG64|5.0|Great book from start to finish so much excitement didn't want to stop reading. Will start on book three an hope it's just as good.
B005NKGEP2|3.0|I didn't like how the book jumped around in the story so much. You should also have a background of French to help understand some things said in the book. It was a decent page turner.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I too would enjoy this game more if you didn't only get diamonds when you level up. Also the rooms once you have to use coins or diamonds to open them you have to find objects to get into them for instance &quot; the hunting room : once you open it you have to collect bullets to get into it before you can explore it. &quot; on to of that you run out of entertain way to fast. Other than these fees things I like the game. it just needs more options to earn more diamonds like you do coins.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I wasn't sure about this book at first but once I got into it, I couldn't put it down! It takes a while for the story to unfold but once it does you will be finished with the book before you know it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am not really a reader, but I had to read this book due to the movie taking so long to come out. ( nov. 2013). I loved it and finished it quickly.  GOOD READ
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I love this season.  I like that the relationship between Castle and Beckett finally happened.  The magnetism between the two is so good I keep looking to see if they are a real couple.  This is the way a show should be.  A good human story and a good mystery with a minimum of violence and gore.  True story telling.  This show is one of the few shows now on TV that I really like to watch.  It is good.  I hope it is around a few more years.
B009XTF8JM|4.0|Possession/exorcism flicks are making a huge resurgence these days, but I really was surprised by how much I enjoyed The Possession. This unique take on the genre follows a girl who obtains a strange box. Her attachment to the box starts to cause drastic changes to a family that is already experiencing distress from a divorce. What's more is that this one has a Jewish backstory, which is rarely seen in the genre. There were some truly creepy and memorable scenes,  and the cameo by Matisyahu was awesome!<br />Source: criticnic.com 19 January 2013<br />Disclosure: Film sent by Lionsgate

B005LAIHCW|4.0|When I saw Jennifer Lawrence in Winter's Bone, I knew it wouldn't be the last time I saw her in movies. In House at the End of the Street she performs fantastically as a girl moving to a new house with her mother. Turns out, the inhabitant of the house next door is the sole survivor of a bloody tragedy that happened several years prior. The psychologically charged film provided plenty of twists and unexpected events. The interesting storyline and and excellent acting performances made this one stand out.<br />Source: criticnic.com 19 January 2013<br />Disclosure: Film sent by 20th Century Fox
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game!!!!! But I wish amazon would catch up with there apps because I am so excited 4 temple run two but amazon doesn't have it yet!
B00A2IUHM6|4.0|Definitely a different movie than I had anticipated (based on the trailers). More drama than expected, slow at parts but ultimately a great movie to watch with your buddies.<br />I recommend giving it a watch!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|.<br />We fell in love with this film.  I would love to tell only my favorite and quirkiest friends about it.  It is so colorful, so different, so indescribable. In a way, I don't think I would ever want to talk about it.
B008YF5DQO|5.0|Great book.  Interesting and well written.  I don't read many biographies these days and I found this one to be an easy read that I wanted to return to.  I also thank Steve Jobs for the products he has helped to create so I guess I find him inspiring.  Very cool.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Our two year old son helps play this game, and the majority of the game he can play with minimum assistance. He love seeing all the different animals. The game itself is fun for us (30 year old parents) to play as well. I am addicted to it now.
B0053O89RY|5.0|I never watched this program until the end of season 3. Everyone seemed to be talking about it, but I just never made the time to view it. I picked up the first 2 seasons for a great price so sat down one lazy weekend and was hooked from the first episode! I actually finished both seasons over the weekend (I did mention it was a &#34;lazy&#34; weekend) and couldn't wait to add season 3 to my collection. I wasn't sorry...this series has great writing and acting talent, and I am so happy they do not add that annoying laugh track. You won't want to have simply one season, you will wan them all!

B005LAII80|5.0|Like your comic book characters adult? Like them challenging?FANTASTIC-yet, gritty,and real? Then look no further,for Dredd is here...and he might just blow your head off. Put quite simply,this is one of the best action movies for years.NO,better than that-one of the best hardcore sci-fi movies for years.Taking no prisoners with its 18 rated certificate,DREDD IS A GLORIOUS WATCH.Colour and artistry are painted on the screen,mixed with blood spatter,to create a truly visual experience;but the fun doesn't just end there:the assault on the senses is compounded by its driving electronic beats.KARL URBAN is the star of the show...and boy oh boy,he gets it just right.HE IS DREDD- and a more striking lead performance you will find hard to find.Not sure?That my friends is charisma.With great support from Olivia Thirlby as \\"Anderson\\" (note that funky narrative trick,to inform us of her powers)this is a fast paced,absorbing,and dark humoured THRILL OF A MOVIE.\\"A MUST SEE\\"...that demands a sequel.Undecided?Checking out reviews to try and make up your mind? The only question you need to ask yourself reader is: \\"WHY HAVEN'T YOU BOUGHT THIS YET ???\\"
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is the most erotic story I have ever read.  I am mortified that I am totally seduced by Christian Grey and find myself feeling every emotion that Ana is feeling.   I would suggest this book to anyone who  is not faint of heart and not afraid to feel apart of this story
B004EPYZP8|5.0|They did a lot of setups early on that explained away what seemed like implausible moments later in the movie so it worked. Then there was that little Deus Ex Machina moment, but it was so subtle we actually had to go back and watch that portion of the movie again to figure out what exactly happened. There were a couple small details we couldn't quite figure out but I won't go into them so as not to ruin the story. Bottom line was we were surprised by twists and turns and most of them naturally worked. Now, if they could have just gotten by with out the little Machina--though at least the main character acknowledge luck was involved.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I love the books story and believe ability this is one of this is one of the first books I could picture every place that went and it look the detailing . I recommend to any who likes romance novels
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|One of the best books I have read about the war in Europe.  Both sides had real people, and many Germans seemed to feel the war was futile.  In the midst of evil, there was still good.<br /><br />From the American point of view, it helped me better understand what the kids like my stepfather went through day after day flying the B-17s.  The stresses were unbelievable and there was no real escape for many other than alcohol or mental issues later in life.
B007THA4FI|4.0|The language is somewhat harsh at times. The book was a book club idea. Grew up in a town just like one in the book. Poor side of town with people you didn't associate with in high school. Dated a boy from across the tracks, he turned out to be my best friend and we shared many wonderful memories. He didn't have an easy life and his life ended very much like Krystal .

Oddball characters, all with the same artsy monotone adult voice (even the kids) that find themselves in silly situations. I rank this above Steve Zissou, but it's WAY below Royal Tenenbaums and Rushmore, as far as comedy goes. Don't expect too much from Bill Murray in this one. He's barely in the movie at all. The real star is Ed Norton as the scout master. It is a sweet movie about young romance and how you can find love even if you're a troubled weird-o.
B008476HBM|5.0|Jane Austen has created a masterpiece that every girl should read at least once in their lifetime. I myself have read it at least twice per year since the age of sixteen. The characters are extremely well developed and the time period well defined. One of the best books of the period to be sure. Mr. Darcy is sure to win the hearts of every girl who reads about him. Emma is the next best book to follow up with, in my opinion.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|You version is a amazing app to have.  You can do devotionals, make plan's, and of course read the bible. You can also have it read the bible for you.  Next it can change the version and language to anything you want.  You also earn badges along the way if you complete devotionals and things that. It has helped me and I bet many other people be more drawn to God!
0062082353|4.0|Chris Kyle has written an interesting book about his experience as a Navy Seal Sniper during the Iraq war.  It is refreshing to read his take on who the bad guys are.  He has no remorse about his many kills.  He writes that he knows that by killing them he was saving American lives.<br /><br />I have been reading about the World War II Band of Brothers.  That was a different generation, but the bond these men have with their fellow soldiers is the same.  They fight for each other.  They are loyal to each other and to their country.<br /><br />These guys do get burned out.  It happened to Chris Kyle.  His blood pressure shot up and became increasingly jumpy.  His marriage suffered.<br /><br />Fortunately, his marriage survived. He now owns his own business and has become reinstituted into civilian life.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|While the case is a little pricey, the features on this particular case are well worth the cost.  I love the revolving stand and the strap for holding is very handy.  The color is not as bright as the picture shown.  I found this to be a little disappointing.  An elastic band is used to hold it closed.  I'm not expecting the elastic to stand up to the test of time.  The cover seems to be well made so only time will tell if it will hold up.  I am enjoying the product for now.  I would recommend this cover to others.  With the cost though, I would expect it to give me many years of use.  We shall see.......
B007BVT5N4|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. It was the ultimate backstage pass into the extreme tour life of Justin Bieber. It showed his ups and downs of being the most recognized human being in the world. Sure, at some times he would complain about not being a \\"normal\\" teen but in the end he loves the famous life and most of all, LOVES HIS BELIEBERS!! Even if you're not a fan of Justin this book might change your mind. 5 stars!
B002EEP3NO|5.0|My 9 year old grandson has wanted this since he was 3. We got it for him this past Christmas. Seeing his reaction when he received it and the Facebook post update of the building process was worth 10 times the price of purchase.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I have a low-end Android tablet, and Adobe Reader was not installed, but the reader that was installed was not that good. The Adobe Reader, that I was finally able to get from Amazon is a great improvement.<br /><br />My tablet is not supported by Google Play, so I'm happy that Adobe finally made reader available on Amazon.
B0085RQLXK|4.0|This LP is a bit different the way it starts like you are in the TwilightZone but it's basic Aerosmith.  It does have several guest singers but I would say all in all it's a pretty good listen.
B00A8SPNYW|1.0|It seems to be more of a demo. Maybe small children would like it. But definately not for adults. Boring.
B000001F6A|3.0|This was in my collection and on vinyl wanted to listen again so got the CD format good classic music
B008FYZIVY|5.0|We weren't sure at first but it is now one of our favorite shows!  I'd recommend it to anyone looking for quality programming.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|It is the perfect alarm because any one can use the great features to make it work, sound, and look just right for them.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This is a timely and thoroughly accurate subject matter for anyone interested in what the next wE skill look like. We need to understand technology and its impact.
B004SDEP38|5.0|Once you have the key, this app is amazing!  It has to be the best productivity package on the market today.  The completeness with which DataViz has developed the functionality is top notch and the ease of use is really very second-nature.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Really love this app.  It really does help me sleep better and more soundly.<br />I really do like the fact that I can mix the different sounds to make my own sound effects.
0765334798|3.0|This book is initially pretty amusing- and anyone who knows \\"Star Trek\\" in and out will find the premise of this book very familiar. However, the primary story here was somewhat predictable as to why things are happening, and while often extremely funny, it begins to collapse under its own weight. The three codas are actually better written and somewhat more somber in tone, but one should approach this novel as simply a chuckle-worthy light read that throws Star Trek's more improbable elements up to full scrutiny, similar to \\"Galaxy Quest\\" (which is much better). And if you think the main raison d'etre is familiar, well, it's been done before.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love it..just wish the puzzle pieces came more often. I love playing it everyday..it's fun and simple and a great stress reliever..lol
B0091REZMW|3.0|This game is fun, but you will only be able to play for so long without paying.  I am not all about winning, so I really don't mind, but if you like to be able to complete or&quot;win&quot; a game, then you might want to look elsewhere.
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|Works incredibly well. No Facebook login needed just press skip. Great picture quality. Does require hardware, smart TV, console or other network connected box.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game was extremely fun and I really enjoy playing the game itself is just very fun and nice for children to play
0765325950|5.0|Interestingly, The Wheel of Time is almost exactly as old as I am--the Eye of the World was published within a month of my birth. This series is one I have grown up with, reading the first in middle school and the rest shortly thereafter. While I do agree that Robert Jordan began to veer off course into the hinterlands of excessive verbosity and irrelevant plot lines at some point in the middle of the series (starting from book 7 or 8), I do think that the series had been pruned to proper course by book 11.<br /><br />Despite the author's death, I do believe that Brandon Sanderson has managed to end the series very effectively. This final installment is an excellent capping stone of the series, wrapping up all the plot lines satisfactorily and fulfilling most of the unanswered questions raised in earlier books.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|super cool! Mega cool!  Whoever thought of this is and genius.  Angry birds and star wars the perfect match! Fun, Fun, Fun!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I would write that this novel is amazing for a self-published work, but that would be disingenuous--it would be an impressive and engaging work by any standard. Thinking back, I only have two criticisms. First, I was a little depressed by the end, since the body count of protagonists was getting a little high--Ryan seems to specialize in building multifaceted characters, and then writing them off. Second, the book resolved the plot somewhat less completely than I would have liked. Then again, that's what sequels are for.<br /><br />All in all, I'm very much looking forward to the next installment of Raven's Shadow.
B00AOOIIVA|5.0|this is a nod to all the old hollywood horror flickes with a Burtonesque touch very cool I spotted his homage to old universal pictures godzilla and various other moments in horror history yet as usual Burton put his own little twist on it and places it in a very ordinary town with some very extrodinary characters.  A real twist on the boy and his dog story sure to be enjoyed by many!
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|The movIe is good in terms of action, graphics and special effects. Lot of things don't make sense, the plot is predictable and corny. Worth a watch but not worth spending your money on.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I'm as happy as that old bald fart on those Postivac commercials! And remember, where ever you go; there you are!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Wish I had read it sooner<br />It was great and I could not put it down.<br />Recommend it highly too.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Opps, I mean live long and prosper! I'm filling in the corners of my video collection, and these are a must for any Trekky! Service was awesome!
B00992CF6W|4.0|It has to be updated time to time because if it does not it not fu<br /><br />n anymore anyway I hope notch and the other developers update plus put in wolf's and pumpkins and lava thank you and hope this help you.
B001EO2UJK|5.0|This compilation of early Genesis pre-Phil Collins is a must, just to get the bonus DVD's that come with the Cd's.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is a story that should be read by those who are afraid or who need inspiration about new experiences or new surroundings. This is a book that gives good insight into how to deal with situations and how to become who you want to be not who everyone else wants you to be.<br />I absolutely loved this book and can read it over and over. This is a book that will not be forgotten not because of its title or it's truth but because of the mark it leaves on the soul. Thank you for showing me that I am a wall flower and its ok to be one.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I was hooked on the first episode of season 1. Now even more so after the first episode of season 3
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Great plot and great graphics! Lots of games and features. I played the game multiple times. Way to go G5&hellip;
B0060YIBLK|5.0|5stars with out a doubt.  The book is very well planned out and easy to read, as well as having short yet interesting example stories. I would recommend this book to everyone who wants to be around people and talk.
0307950654|3.0|First off, I am not an expert on the writings of Jane Austin.  On the other hand, I think that PD James seems to have captured the tone of the period and the characterization of Darcy and Elizabeth et.al. They who done it kept the reader's attention to the conclusion of the mystery.  I personally feel the book went several pages to long but this could be a stylistic feature of Austen rather than James.  I think it portrayed the roles of women and men of the period and differentiated between the upper crust and the lesser classes.  I'd recommend this book as an alternative amusement to the PD James usual repertoire.  Not spectacular but not bad either.
B0096DFBZQ|2.0|This game is lame. You can't choose a different character cause you have to buy the whole version. Im mad i got this thing they call a &quot;game&quot;.
B002W5UVSM|4.0|This book is very detailed and intense. It took me a while to read it, but it was never a dull moment.
B005OCFGTO|3.0|We have to switch our TV to &#34;zoom&#34; in order to fill-up the entire screen.  I guess the aspect ratio isn't really for widescreen.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Some reviewers have considered this volume pedantic, but I loved how it pulled together loose ends and introduced new characters and opportunities for future installments!  Looking forward to the next book.
B0094OLFUW|5.0|This album does everything but disappoint. With the group only have releasing one prior album, one can only wonder how their talent will grow with another studio release. It is quite apparent that stardom hasn't caused these musicians to give in to autotuners and terrible featured artists or something terrible. This is like a continuation of the self titled album with just as much quality and talent. This just leaves you wanting more, hopefully we can all see another album from The XX in the future as well.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book touched me. It taught me lessons, made me realize things and just changed the way I think about life. I mean yes at first it didn't make too much sense to me, but I read about it and thought and it makes sense. It's a story about someone learning about himself, discovering himself. It's beautiful. Read it. I'm sure you'll love it.
B008Q09K2U|5.0|As per usual, De Mille develops his characters and storyline with finesse until you are completely hooked and unable to put the book down!
B0072GPQNG|5.0|such a movie - fast ship good shape- and such a great story<br />a movie all should own-- get one for a gift--
B008KW43TE|5.0|Frank ocean has a voice that you can really get lost in. I have not really been listening to much hip hop lately, but i decided to give this a chance because i really like some of his older songs like \\"swim good\\". His songs are deep and have meaning, and they have good beats and sound good. Great album.
B004SIP9VA|5.0|love richard gere- had remembered how much i liked this movie<br />-- so added to collection- fast ship and good cd.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This has got to be one of the most addicting shows I have found in a very long time.  Love how the story lines interweave with the staff and the members of the house.  Well written and amazing actors.  Highly recommended.

B004G600A4|5.0|I was shocked at the HD quality of this movie.  The hair looked so real, I was totally amazed.  I think little kids would love this movie.  The horse was funny and it was not scary.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Im sure it was appreciated.. The giftee had it opened, read and wanting more within a day or so of receiving it.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|This movie will never fade. It is a true classic. Donna Reed is so pretty. I think Donna Reed and Jimmy Stewart make the top 5 all time film love scenes. Their acting is real.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|hexage Ltd has made a great game! It is a very fun game. Also the main guy (you) says some funny things. Very good game.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|It's a really good game since it us hard to find a strategic game that u actually do battle..  now for the cons. It has crashed on me a couple times and  has even crashed on a loop...  which u may have to reinstall.
B005KELQEU|5.0|This is well padded and will portect my Kindle from an accidental fall.  It allows me to carry it in my pruse without worrying about it being damaged.  Very good bargain for the money.
0140544518|5.0|A very clever and interesting tale of the big bad wolf who tries to borrow a cup of flour from his neighbors, but his cold gets the better of him and he enjoys some tastey meals in the process.  Recommended to the younger crowd.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|This book told a different story about the financial meltdown... the main characters described foresaw the problems inherent in the financial instruments being created but essentially no one listened to them.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|I ask why this book has been sold throughout the world in many translations. What are woman looking for now?
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Love the book, the plot is good, tho a bit short. I plan to look for more from this author.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I love John Grisham book and I read all but a few newer ones.  But, this one was not my favorite by any means. Dragged on with the story for pages. Would or will I read another John Grisham of course I will. However, in my purchase I bought a Stephen King The Wind through the Key by mistake so I have to deal with right now. Thanks
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|From slow motion brains being blown out to rape porn minus the xxx rating, this movie was all about shock and lacked anything more.  If you want to watch an x rated video game without having to figure out the hacks, this movie is for you.
B000FC1192|5.0|I've read a few of Neil gaimams books before and this one lived up to his rep it captured my attention as soon as I started
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|This app lets you watch a huge variety of streaming content right on your phone!  I haven't tested the screen switching yet, but even if that won't work with my TV I am happy with all the streaming content.  Also, it prompted me for a Facebook login, but I picked &quot;skip&quot; and it still works.  So fortunately that must not be mandatory.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Even though the season's where short this was a hilarious show, especially since I grew-up in the states watching a lot of BBC!
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Because I was reading Proof of Heaven for a Book Club I finished reading it, however, I would have stopped one third the way through otherwise. The consensus of our group was pretty much a thumbs down with only one gal really liked it. We decided to pick more carefully for next months book....and selected Wild.  Hopefully this will be a better selection.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I was looking for a game came across this one and played for hours and enjoy it so much.I will play it every day.<br />Pumpkin

B00846REIS|3.0|Fifty shades all over again<br />. Good read but same plot line.<br />Predictable, well written, a little tamer than fifty shades.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|If you love romance novels or romantic movies, please see this movie.  It is entertaining from beginning to end with a GREAT ending!
B00AA6C5SY|3.0|too expensive. movies are good quality but i think the price was way too much for this product. cool lighter.
B005JSM5YW|3.0|Too much Steve Carroll and not enought Julianne Moore or Ema Stone. Wish it had some other lead actor in this DVD.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Completely unexpected ending!!! Didn't see that coming!! Can't wait to read the third book!! Caught me completely off guard!!! Great read!!
B0000E2FLC|5.0|I bought this to replace the c/d I miss placed. Great C/D of a classic rock and roll band from the 90's.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I really liked the actors in the movie. Very funny and i loved all the music in the film! One of my faves!
B005OLF6BI|2.0|I thought it would be a good value but it sounded like a bunch of girls screaming in the background. Poor audio recoeding.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|All the verbal profanity takes away from the movie.  I guess that is why they have it &#34;unrated.&#34;  I would love to have my money back.
B0059XTUEK|3.0|My wife and daughter said it was a good DVD. Bought it for a xmas gift and everyone enjoyed watching it.
B0076NAW48|5.0|Excellent recording.  Chuck Leavell included wonderful selections for this album.<br />This is an album that is specific to blues piano and a particular time period in music history<br />in our country.  The surprise are the guest artists that perform with Chuck Leavell on the album.<br />Local performing musicians, including my bass teacher, fill out the instrumental ensemble.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I give this book only three stars because out of the 3 in the series, it was my least favorite... But none the less, the series is amazing and will remain at the top of my list!
1611761069|3.0|this one you just think you have it all gessed how its going to end  and wow you missed it again
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|Osmos is a great game I like the gameplay and the graphics are amazing, I really like the music  but many people have said this is very relaxing game it's actually very frustrating at times, it runs great on my kindle fire hd, overall I give it four stars.
B00005JM0B|4.0|Rise of the Machines is typical Terminator stuff, with another battle between two machines and humanity saved in the end. Yes, the franchise has reached a crossroads, and this film is indicative of the lack of new ideas from the creators. But............I think that this movie works and is appealing because the Terminator movies have historically been few and far between, so the viewer is yearning for a new film every 7-8 years. The anticipation is there, and while a lot of stuff is carryover from previous films, we nonetheless don't mind. Arnold is again in top form for this one, and the one-liners are there as usual. The decision to go with a female terminator was different and welcome. I found this film to be enjoyable in plot, acting, and special effects. Though this is easily the weakest of the first three films, I still highly recommend it for its entertainment value.
B005MJ883K|5.0|a great game that keeps the boys busy for a few hours, it's not easy so there not bored , a throwback to good old games
B004FRX0MY|5.0|This is a good app to use use to get songs for your phone and Amazon is fair in their pricing.
B006LSZECO|4.0|this is one of those books that keeps you reading right from page one. There are enough twists and turns that make you want to keep reading. I've recommended this book to several people and would recommend it to you....<br />Made me want to check out some other books by this author!
B004GJDQT8|5.0|This is a good app to use use to shop for books for your phone or other mobile devices and Amazon is fair in their pricing.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Total page turner. I could not put it down.<br />It's enticing, well written, intricate and beautiful. The only problem is I couldn't sleep for a week because I couldn't put it down!
B008TMA1LY|5.0|I love this game! YOu can earn coins and hearts on a daily basis (24hour period in the game) YOur have a chance to buy wallpaper, flooring, tables and chairs so you can decorate however you want. You can upgrade the meals and the characters as well as the bathroom, register and music box. The more leveled up you become the more customers the game awards you. I recommend to use your hearts to buy Keroppi first because he mans the cash register only. I've been told this game is similar to resturant dash, or any of the cafe games on facebook. I enjoy playing this game. It's a little to fast for the younger age group.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Total page turner. I could not put it down.<br />It's enticing, well written, intricate and beautiful. The only problem is I couldn't sleep for a week because I couldn't put it down!
B001XV1X6A|2.0|It was Okay. Over the top for Special Effects. Would have liked more of Jules Verne type of discovery. Actress was very beautiful.

B000B7HZXM|5.0|Know with his typicals rock performances in the seventeen, developping a unknowing groove with his bigs music of the past.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|By far the best Scifi Ebook i have read in the last 6 months. Go ahead download the sample, then you'll get hooked and end up buying it, It's only 99 cents, and well woth it.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This is an awesome pkg and worth the price. The book that came with it is priceless..Highly Recommended and a must for all collectors!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its like having your own horse. ive always dreamed about having a horse now I can have one. a virtual horse at least.
B0063IH60K|5.0|lots of fun. makes you concentrate and think. good training for your brain. good to be able to play without a partner.
B003UAMWWQ|5.0|I'm a huge sci-fi nerd, and this movie is filled with great jokes and references. There are puns abound, and I love it. If you love sci-fi, you'll love this movie. If you love Mel Brooks movies, you'll love this movie. There's not much more to be said. It's just a great movie…<br /><br />Okay, I really love the part where Dark Helmet is playing with his dolls. Apparently the whole scene was ad libbed by Rick Moranis. He does great with his voice switching (he makes a lower voice with his helmet down, and a nasally one with it up).
0345803493|1.0|Holy crap! Double crap! Holy cow triple crap! Crap, my crap! Inner goddess crap!<br />^<br />^<br />This is what I remember from this book. Rich language, descriptive writing, a thrilling plot--where are they? They may not be mandatory for a self-published book, but we have a bestseller here!<br /><br />This is it. The downfall of literature. While we are moving higher on the technological level, when we are ready to observe the Universe and soon will be ready to populate other planets, we are destroying something as beautiful as art.<br />Now it's only about feeling aroused, cashing on poor writing, and using smart marketing tools.<br /><br />Is this literature? Hell, no.<br />Is this fiction? Yes, sure.<br />Is it worth reading? It's definitely not worth my time. Decide for yourselves.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Game is kind of fun but using energy sucks.  Don't see the need  for the hassle and frustration..  Paid for the game and should be able to play as long as I want.<br /><br />......
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|love the game it fun i told everybody about this game they love it i think that u should make more leveler so they can play more lovely game
B0096DZKZC|3.0|My kindle fire did not have enough memory to run this game. Deleted many, many items and came back to re-install it and still said not enough memory so I have no idea how the game works as obviously I will never get to play it as I will never have enough free memory. $5 mistake on my part, so keep in mind this uses a ton of memory space--unless you only have a few things on your device you may not be able to run it.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Slow start, then very good main story with twists and turns. Became fully engrossed but then felt incredibly let down with the ending. Would have loved the book if the author had wrapped things up better.  The whole story left me craving justice but you never get any.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|Even though the movie is fantastic and a visual feast, the book is even more. You get a greater understaning of 'Pi', his family and upbringing, plus a more in-depth description of the events at sea.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Very good graphics.  Inventive playing methods keeps it interesting but not too frustrating.  I was surprised with the number and variety of tasks.  More then most games. Liked the drawers that opened with moving furniture and hidden compartments to search through. I will be interested in other games by this programmer or should I say game artist.
B000SXMS7W|5.0|i am a huge blondie fan, but of all of their albums, this is by far the best one... it rocks!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a good book by a great author.  It's creepy and fascinating at the same time.  You will never know again if you really truly know who you are married to...
B008M721MS|4.0|This app works well on my kindle fire hd. The only complaints I have is the picture quality is low at times and tends to freeze. It is also quiet at times. And lastly, why so many permissions? I felt kind of exposed by all of the things you grant when downloading this app. Anyhow this app is great to use and is easy to understand.
B009O5CLZY|1.0|The last update where my coin doubler disappeared and all the stuff I earned and my achievements literally wiped all my progress
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great game not only can you fly in creative mode you also have most blocks. in survival there are monsters and that's fun.
0449011917|4.0|This book was a bit slow compared to the others. There wasn't as much action and some new and rather boring characters were introduced. Still, there were some interesting nuggets of information and Cersei is so dreadful that you keep going in hopes of her demise!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my kid got first place in the competitions it is she is at level 5 so she likes it  so much
0449011909|5.0|This was the best book because it was full of action and a lot of it was completely unexpected. This was a book that you couldn't put down.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is fantastic and the graphics are awesome so lifelike and really fun to play glad I found it
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I thought this book was wonderful.  I purchased it after seeing a special on this author on 60 minutes ( or one of those types of shows).  Well worth the time if you have children
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was a spectacular action packed sequel to the hunger games I couldn't put it down infill the last page.
B004U52VPS|4.0|I purchased this because my children like angry birds but I'm really not sure this was a worthwhile purchase, they tired of it very quickly and it's a little expensive for what you get
0007334052|5.0|I purchased this book as a gift for a good friend who had never read it.  I have loved this story for years.  The characters are well rounded and &#34;real&#34;.  You would know them, if you saw them walking down the street.  The story is engaging.  I haven't read it in years, but I still remember the people, the story, and the final words the main character says.  Overall worth reading.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|See that pun in the title? That's all I have time for because I must get back to playing Plague Inc!
B007N0REX6|1.0|Bought this because we saw Slash with Myles Kennedy on a guitar special on TV & they were terrific - acoustic stuff. They plugged this CD & we assumed it would contain what they did on TV. It did not. It is all electric, loud, repetitive, head-banger metal. They could do good acoustic stuff if they chose, but apparently they did not.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I honestly did not believe that I would like this novel when I first began to read it. But after a while I found it hard to put down , it has become one of my favorite books. The style of writing is amazing as well as the attention to detail. There are many times where you will find a connection with the characters and the situations they are in and can empathize with them. Over all, this book was a pleasure to read and I highly recommend it to anyone.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|An imaginative fantasy that skillfully blends a modern era with fantastical beings and elements, in a story supported by antique photographs.  Because this book begins a series, the ending was not as satisfying as I would have liked, and I questioned some of the decisions made by the 400-year-old &#34;children&#34; (wouldn't they have learned more than they seemed to know in the 400 years of their lives?), but in general, I enjoyed this story.  It was a pleasant departure from the overdone quest fantasy that proliferated after publication of The Lord of the Rings, breathing fresh air into a genre I'd abandoned years ago due to repetitive storylines.
B008MEM24S|5.0|My daughter loves this game. She bought it with her gift card money. It is perfect for a 7 year old and we have fun together throng to free Perry.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Very engaging. Great graphics. Excellent story line. Very balanced with hidden objects puzzles and other puzzles. Not too easy, just perfect.
B00B19G01C|1.0|i ordered this movie as a rental and was charged for both a rental and purchase of it. i am very unhappy about this. i have emailed customer support and have not received a response. i will not be renting or buying movies from Amazon ever again.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is my first camera case. It is well built and has quality zippers. Countless ways to organize backpack since all the dividers connect with velcro and can be moved to any location. It is pretty large for everyday use, so I bought a smaller case for day trips. But if you want to take a camera, multiple lenses, flash, etc, this is a good way to do it.
1452101248|5.0|I'm not even a vegetarian, and I usually make about 3 recipes from cookbooks but I have honestly made almost all of the recipes in this book.  On most occasions, I add a protein, but often regret it.  I made the paella last night with shrimp and sausage and it ruined the flavor of all the vegetables.  Turns out I should trust the professional cooks.  I bought 3 more as gifts for Christmas; that's how much I like it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I must be addicted to Michael Connelly books because the more I read them the more I want.  What a pleasant addiction.<br />In this Harry Bosch book the Robbery Homicide detective go back 20 years to a case he was assigned during L.A. riots.  Starting with very little evidence, Harry soon adds the little pieces together to solve a very complex murder.  The author keeps some of the same characters from previous novels, like Harry's lovable teenage daughter.  As always, this binds the soft lovable side of Harry with the tough LA detective.<br />A great book to add to your series or a good one to start with.
0765318741|5.0|In this copy of \\"I Am Legend\\", the first half of the book is Matheson's hugely popular story about Robert Neville, the last man on earth. The second half of the book is ten short stories. So...<br /><br />I Am Legend-is a great story that may not seem like such a unique idea now a days, but must have been at least semi-original when it was published nearly sixty years ago. Aside from the actual content story, what I really enjoyed about this book is Matheson's simple-yet-effective writing style. His writing reads as if it was written just last year instead of over half-a-century ago. I greatly admire his style, for being modern and seemingly ahead of his time.<br />As for the actual story itself, well, it's very good in its own right. The last time I attempted to read a story like this (meaning just one character all alone) was The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon by King, and it didn't really work that well for me. I am Legend, despite barely any dialogue and only slight plot twists (at least for the first 90% of the story), is thrilling and horrifying. The story I expected to be great, was just that.<br /><br />As for the short stories-they are easily as good, and a few of them I'd even say are better, than the main attraction. If you ask me, there wasn't a bad one in the bunch.<br />I really enjoy stories where the narrative is sort of a half-mad rambling from one of the characters: A Dress of White Silk and Mad House were incredible stories told in this style.<br />Person to Person was another great one. Unique idea, mysterious and chilling, fantastic.<br />Even the shortest story, about three pages long, The Near Departed, manages to make an impact.<br />Prey is a terrfying story that reminds me of Chucky from Child's Play, which freaked me out as a kid.<br />Buried talents is a quick story with a nice little ending.<br />Witch War, The Funeral, Dance of the Dead, From Shadowed Places: all dark and creepy stories. Dance of the Dead in particular contains some frigthening images.<br /><br />Overall, I am Legend is certainly a classic, but that's only some of the fun in this book. Great title story, and GREAT set of short stories. Five stars for sure.ing images.<br /><br />Overall, I am Legend is certainly a classic, but that's only some of the fun in this book.

B00447G2PM|3.0|So I googled what is the best imax 3D movie and this pops up telling me it is the best out of all of the imax(That is for ocean seeing) so, that is how I came across this. It wasn't really mind blowing with a lot of pop out effects but it was an okay movie for a test of 3D.<br /><br />Overall<br />Great movie good story telling too.I'd get it if like seeing the undersea stuff.
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|I love this song. It is one of my favorite James Bond theme songs. This CD contails the title song by Adele and that's it. If you're a fan of the new Bond film, I'd check this out.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Very good story.. like the story line. Hope to read more from this author<br /><br />Hope she writes more<br /> Would love Jeff's story.  Maybe even caro...
B004J4WKTW|5.0|A fantastical read. A different kind of love story, the characters were enchanting and the story grabs you from the first sentence!!
B007M45PMU|5.0|I first had found out about The Lumineers when I heard a friend listening to Ho Hey. So I decided to check out the rest of their self-named album, and I really liked it. The next day I saw it on Amazon for $4 I decided it was a must buy.
B005UBNL0A|5.0|Exellent, As far as I'm concerned the AMD Products are far more stable than some others and I have been using them for 15 years.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Quay would u go out with me baby I love you  do you love me quay I miss you baby
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|Came safely, just as described and quickly. Even had my disney movie reward code in there for an extra 100 points! :)
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love the ending. Gives you just enough but keeps you wanting more. I thought they said this just another 50 shades....but it has its own drama. It's a different read from 50...and I loved 50.
B00AYDC5HY|3.0|My family watched for dinner and movie night. The kids were mildly interested. My wife and I laughed a few times. It wasn't bad, but there are better. Actually Tim Burton has better.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|Gave this 5stars because I read it years ago and it still kept me turning pages as quickly as possible.  Also really like the main character to the point of reading the other books in this series.  Great characters, great story...a fun read.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This was not my favorite John Grisham book. The writing is great as always. I did not enjoy the storyline.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Very challenging and the tap feature is very nice.  I use the double deck which is even more challenging.  Fun
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|This version is top notch. Although the violence and gore is a reminder of 300 and the series Spartacus but with bullets instead of blades, this Dredd is Dirty Harry on steroids plus. The fact you never see Dredd's full face adds a mysterious element to the character as well.
B005FYCEMI|4.0|I enjoyed listening to the album since I lost the original years ago due to high water in the home.  Nostalgic I guess one could say.  Definately some of the tracks were just &#34;filler&#34; but there are some really good licks on this recording.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Fun game. Good graphics &amp; length. Nice story line &amp; really fun monkey. Play the game to see what he does for you.
1439190275|5.0|The book to have if you are just starting out with the Atkins diet or if it has been years since you tried it.  Many health issues discussed and the benefits explained.  A great help while on the diet and very informative.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have absolutely no complaints about this book. I can tell you that once you start reading you will not want to put it down.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Easy to use and works as expected. Nice to have the app when I need to pass time, sitting and waiting or anytime I have downtime!
B000FC1MCS|5.0|This was  a very interesting book to read! I enjoyed all the details and can really appreciate the storyline! Awesome book!!
B008458O3S|5.0|A very fun and challenging game! I am impressed by the many levels of the game and the thinking required. Way to go!
B000SUKPKM|5.0|I am a prospector on albums. Sometimes I know only one song by a band, I like it,in this case \\"Iris.\\" This band blew me away! All I knew of them was \\"Iris,\\" but \\"Name,\\" \\"Feel the Silence,\\" and others, well all of them, are songs that I will listen over and over again. I bought this thinking it would have one or two songs, but there is so much soul, and feeling that I really don't have a favorite. Can anyone direct me to other albums by Goo Goo Dolls? I generally like albums, and not just singles. Buy this album.[[ASIN:B00122MWBK Greatest Hits Volume One - The Singles]]
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|Just okay.  Lots of action but the plot could have been better.  Could have used a little more thought in some parts.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Good enough for me. They are well written and engaging texts and for a reasonable cost. It is worth it
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I liked it so much that as soon as I finished it I tried to download the next one. Was disappointed to know it isn't coming out til may. Finished in 1 day
B008673ZAQ|5.0|So glad I found these Crossfire books. The love story is very good. Much better then the Fifty Shades books.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|Anyone who loves anime movies will like this! It's got a good story & very comical @ times. If you've watched any other movies by Hayao Miyazaki, you'll love this one. It's a movie for the collection.
098555780X|5.0|Embora não eu não tenha conhecimento da língua inglesa, pretendo começar a estudar esse ano, as fotos contidas no livro  e os vídeos no youtube já me satisfazem. Grato.
B00688628M|5.0|The HBO series Band of Brothers is a spectacular production - well worth every hour.  In addition, the quality of the production from a visual and audio standpoint is absolutely stunning.  Extremely well done.
B00AQF8CJ0|3.0|I loved this game at first, but after a couple o' days, Pudding Monsters got repetitive. I thought I'd like this since I enjoyed Cut the Rope, but it was a whole lot different!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I am determined to read all of this before seeing the movie. No, I never saw the musical either. It is epic and I am afraid i would never make it through if I already knew how it turns out. Hugo is a masterful, if highly detailed story teller. This is just my kind of read!
B000IDGDPA|4.0|I thought that this was going to be the typical romantic comedy. Even though it had a lot of the typical aspects of one, it had a subtle charm to it. Helen Hunt's character was interesting to say the least...........she was witty, elegant and had a very mature way of moralizing her behavior. She was seen as an outcast and she was not affected by it (which I thought was very intriguing).<br /><br />All in all, it is worth the watch.
B004YDTTTW|5.0|I'm a Wonderland junkie so it would be difficult to disappoint me with any retelling of Lewis Carroll's classic books. However there is really no better way to get my &#34;fix&#34; than by watching this particular interpretation, the one that so many followers have been inspired by. The Mad Hatter and March Hare are hilarious! The Cheshire Cat is really weird but endearing. The music is beautiful and enchanting. Every day I still hear Alice singing &#34;World Of My Own&#34; in my mind. I love this movie so much... I think I'll go watch it right now!
B000F4RHB6|4.0|There are a couple of tracks on this CD that I don't care for, but that is a personal opinion. I must say the track I love the most is the duet with Huey Lewis and Gwynneth Paltrow, &#34;Cruisin.&#34; Wonderful! That made the whole CD worth purchasing, though I am enjoying all the familiar hits the group made. &#34;I Want A New Drug&#34; is still just plain fun!
B000BT97AO|5.0|A surreal dark fantasy that takes place in a shadowy dream wold created by Niel Gaiman and Muppet Studios. I watch this one repeatedly and never get tired of it. Intriguing enough to keep adults engaged but safe for children to enjoy too. A great example for what movies in this genre should aspire to.
B003JTHXOK|1.0|SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY. HOW COULD AN AUTHOR GET AWAY WITH THIS? HE WRITES THE NOTEBOOK & THE LAST SONG ETC... BUT THIS IS A COPY OF SLEEPING WITH ENEMY!! HE SHOULD BE ASHAMED TO HAVE PUBLISHED A BOOK LIKE THIS!! TO TOP IT OFF THEY MADE A MOVIE OUT OF IT AND DIDN'T CALL IT SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY! WHAT A RIPOFF!! WOULD GIVE IT ZERO STARS IF POSSIBLE!!!
0823023494|2.0|I have read several books on how to draw characters. With this books title including the word &#34;personality&#34; I was expecting more in the details of of character development and less focus on the drawing style. Maybe this was a fault of my own perception but ultimately this book did not inspire me the way I anticipated it might.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I was very impressed with this series, even though I accidently bought it on Amazon. I had a gift card given to me and accidently clicked on the buying button before I realized what I had done. I will enjoy watching, even though I didn't intend to buy it. I have Prime and didn't realize this one wasn't included with the Prime viewing.
B00000K3D4|5.0|Great Muppets, great music, entertaining acting. I don't think I know anyone who hasn't seen this movie and loved it. It's like &#34;The Dark Crystal&#34; but with a couple of human characters and infectious musical numbers. I can almost guarantee that at some point after seeing this movie you WILL say to someone in your life: &#34;You remind me of the babe.&#34;
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Amazing and thought-provoking. Each reader will develop his/her own emotions and relive memories once forgotten. Every person has a part in this story as some part of life, either as a participant or as a wallflower.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is fun for all ages. It is a challenge even for adults. There are times you'll need to do a level multiple times...but more then worth the frustration...
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Very interesting plot, unfortunately the plot begins to fall off two thirds of the way through. Good movie for combat veterans
B003UBTX6S|3.0|Slow start after such an action packed first novel, but gained momentum after the first few chapters. Can't wait to start next one...
B000NY12LO|5.0|This story gives the reader the view inside the lives of citizens in a small town after a massive school shooting at the high school. There is a lot of back-and-forth from present to past tense, as well as between narrater perspectives (shooter, victim, lawyer, parents). The time period is easy to follow, however the perspectivchange without much warning. I would not recommend this book to many people, due to the anxiety that could result. This book it for the faint hearted, especially when looking at recent events.
1609611543|5.0|Wow!  I had no idea wheat was at the bottom of so many of my problems.<br />Since reading this book and eliminating wheat from my diet, I already see a huge<br />difference in my joint pain...much improvement.  My acid reflux is gone, I sleep better<br />and I have so much more energy during the day!<br />A great book with so much useful information and advice!
1932907009|5.0|Not that you'll want to follow anyone's page by page template all of the time, but this book lays out the story beats in a marketable fashion. Even if you're not marketing your screenplay (just writing for your own filming), this is the rhythm the audience will expect. Knowing what they expect allows you to surprise them.
B006OW817C|5.0|I have never regarded the Diabelli Variations as being top-tier Beethoven. Given how much I enjoy the artistry of Andreas Staier, I leapt upon this copy at the library: here was an opportunity to move it up the ranks. Staier plays a fortepiano `after Conrad Graf' - I presume this is an instrument that Beethoven would have recognized - whatever that means in a mundane sense. Before I move onto the disc, let's digress.<br /><br />My `Beloved Adversary' on Amazon recently made a point.<br /><br />`Of course \\"we\\" all assume that [Composer X] knew what he was doing and therefore `we have become ever more assiduous in matching his intentions, performing his works on instruments he would have recognized, with tempi and articulation that he would have chosen, mastering . . . techniques that he would have relished.'<br /><br />To my mind, this is 'flat earth-ish' at best. Auden tells us that `we are lived by the powers we pretend to understand.' In many a creation, there is more content than what its creator intended - the muse is the ultimate determinant as to scope and its translation into meaning. Elsewhere, Virginia Woolf famously told us that human nature changed on the eve of Armageddon. If so - if so - how is one to measure the abyss that lies between our Weltanschauung (world view) and that of Beethoven's audience in the late 1820s in Imperial Vienna? What does this all mean? I suggest this: it is pernicious to think that we can encompass if not enmesh Beethoven merely by playing one of his works stylishly on an instrument of his time. Any art that is not able to transcend the circumstances of its genesis to address later generations on their own terms and mysteriously so is an art that warrants the scrutiny of bald-headed scholars and listeners alike and that's about it.<br /><br />With that rant out of the way, be it on a harpsichord or fortepiano, Steinway or Moog Synthesizer, the artistry of Andreas Staier is always a delight. To my ears, this is endeavour is a complete success: a master is at work. Staier has the requisite sense of theatre to bring this work fully to life. His characterization is vivid. Be it the drollness of XXIII or the numinosity of XX, he is equal to the task. The rambunctiousness of `Beethoven the Giant in the Land of the Lilliputians' (XXII) is vibrantly conveyed. Come the final Variation, there is a overwhelming sense of homecoming as if Odysseus has finally returned to Ithaca, well-worn but wiser. Nor is there any sense of miniaturization with a fortepiano in play; one soon forgets the instrument in question to marvel at the realization.<br /><br />The other reviewer argues that the resonance of the acoustic militates this recording. I disagree. It is true that in many of the Variations (such as II, XIV & XX) Staier plays pianissimo but this is never done precociously. The recording is cut at the one level. While it is unlikely that this studio performance was recorded in the one take, I cannot detect any seams. Whenever he hammers it, therefore, it is a thrill. If the other reviewer had not made this point, it would never have come to my mind.<br /><br />Buy this recording with confidence. It's a stupendous Opus 120. Evergreen, it speaks to today and beyond.omplete success: a master is at work. Staier has the requisite sense of theatre to bring this work fully to life. His characterization is vivid.

B005X5XIL0|5.0|Simplemente disfruté de este conciertazo. La iluminación del Central Park y las vistas de la ciudad mientras anochece son simplemente impresionantes.<br />Los músicos son excelentes, el audio muy bien. la calidad de la imagen también.<br />El documental muestra cómo se realizó el concierto sus etapas de planeacion y ejecución y cómo estuvo a punto de ser cancelado por los problemas climáticos.<br />Las presentaciones de Tony Bennett, Celine Dion y Ana María Martínez son excepcionales.<br />Recomiendo este producto a todos los admiradores de la buena música y en especial de Bocelli. Excelente para un fin de semana o un domingo en la tarde con los amigos.
0812973992|5.0|Beautifully written and intricately woven, the author moves effortlessly from one life-story to another in this complex novel about one man's ambition to walk a tightrope strung between the NYC Twin Towers

141659521X|3.0|First of all, I am sure we are all thrilled that Vince Flynn is writing again after a bout with cancer. He writes movingly about it in the introduction. I wish him a lot of healing. Here we go again with super agent man Mitch Rapp the world's scariest secret operative who seems to be well known among the world's bad guys but they just can't figure out how to kill him. Not sure what the US's back up plan is if Rapp goes down since all of the other professionals are just mediocre to good but not as scary as Rapp. Flynn makes one mistake in this book. He tells us exactly what the bad guys are up to so there is little suspense. We are always led in his books to think that Capital Hill is about to defeat the forces of Irene Kennedy and the CIA but it never plays out in the book. There in fact is little tension or development in this area. Irene Kennedy always seems to win but she's just not able to control her boys--Rapp and Stan Hurley, who curiously is dying of cancer in six months but is well enough to perform at a super human strength of 20 years younger. Lastly, writing this review is just way below my pay grade!
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Liked it. OK can't wait till next one. In the first book and series Nico was introduced I thought he was like way younger than Percy Jackson.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is entertaining and fun!! It gives you motivation to keep trying to advance. Each level increases the challenge.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Captivating, enjoyable. Could not put it down. Colleen Hoover is an incredible author. Wish there was a continuation of this story. What happens between Sky (Hope) and Dean Holder after? Is that all they need? Each other?
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Did not watch the first two years till two weeks ago (on my Prime streaming video)! Am now addicted. Cannot wait till Monday morning to watch the new episode from the night before. Cannot watch it on TV for various reasons. Love the characters. Love the costumes and sets. Great fun!!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Fun game. The storyline was interesting and the graphics were good. It's a Good way to entertain yourself for a few hours.
B003IEJZUG|4.0|A pretty good book.  The first part read slow.  Glad I read before watching the movie which I will do once it comes out on DVD.  Couldn't imagine being shipwrecked!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The trilogy is a good story of perseverance, loyalty,  true friendship and ultimately love through VERY trying times and circumstances!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was great didn't know what was going to happen looking forward to the third book just bought it
B003O86FMW|5.0|I chose this book because I have always wanted to read this but never had the time. Kindle made it too easy! The book was everything I thought it would be and more, I could not wait to read the other two in the trilogy, and also had to watch the movie.
0446585041|1.0|I agree with the others that gave a negative rating, this book is a waste.  On her show she is endearing but in print it just comes off as annoying.  She goes in circles to the point I had to put it down at times and walk away and it is a fairly short book.  I think I only actually laughed one time on the whole reading.  Also I feel really bad because I had bought this for my best friend as a birthday present to take on a long flight, feel like I owe her a new gift now.<br /><br />I haven't read her other two books so I dont know how they compare but at this point I doubt I would bother to find out.  I definitely do not recommend this book.

1933633867|5.0|I can't possibly compete with the other great reviews folks have written about this book.<br /><br />Suffice it to say, I find it hard to believe that this book won't be one of the few books in the core library on macro-economics.<br /><br />Students of history will particularly enjoy this book: the author is able to encapsulate major eras in human history from a point of view not often seen.<br /><br />I am a fiscal conservative but this book certainly raised questions I had not considered. Having read the book, I feel a) I need to read it again (and take notes); and, b) that I have completed an undergraduate Macro-Economics 101 course from David Graeber.<br /><br />I have had an eclectic and aggressive reading program since 2002; this book is among the best of the non-fiction.

B000002AGN|5.0|I bought this remastered CD over 10 years ago, and it is still one of my favorite classic jazz albums of all time.  My Dad (now 72) had this in vinyl, and along with other great albums in his jazz collection, this one really stood out (thus my motivation to get the CD!).  What can I say more than anyone else probably has...the stuff going on here was groundbreaking stuff, and it is so cool to listen to this today and say 'this freakin rocks'.  Dave Brubeck was way ahead of his time, and it was sad to see his recent passing.  I am a jazz fan, and have not been fond of what has become today's 'jazz sound' (aka 'smooth jazz')...I do enjoy some Kenny G now and then, but the REAL jazz is stuff like this, and it just doesn't sell whatever the radio station has to sell, so you just gotta buy great jazz like this and listen to it in the privacy of your own home/Ipod/where-ever.<br /><br />Take Five and buy this - NOW!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|wow!!!!! best game ever!!! love it so much!!! thx to my sis/bff I got this app!!!!! you should so get this app!
B002N1AERI|5.0|This is my first EPICA CD, so I do not have the knowledge to compare this to the previous stuff...but after seeing what I could on YouTube and the net, I can confidently say that this is some of EPICA's best stuff to date (mind you, some of the past stuff is great too!!!).<br /><br />What turned me on to this mob?  The beauty of Simone's voice (thanks to Kamelot's duo's with Khan) which had me checking out where she came from...and EPICA here I am!!!  Let me tell you first off that I am not crazy about the grunting/cookie monster vocals that the great musicians in EPICA seem to have to offer in the vocal department, but luckily it is not in the majority of the vocals!!!  Let them take a lesson from Opeth...this kind of grunt-vocal is crap and belongs to a death metal sound of yesteryear!  Epica creates such great music already...no need to muck it up with argggggggyhhhhhh vocals.<br /><br />Oh well, this is one great CD nonetheless...there is a LOT of great songwriting, and once you give it a listen, there are songs that just do no leave your memory easily...to me, the sign of a GREAT CD, eh?
B0063IH60K|5.0|It plays beautifully on my new tablet that I got for Christmas.  I'm having TONS of fun with it.  You'll love it too.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great set, dynamite costumes and story captures you from the first fifteen minutes and never quits. Cast is excellent and quite believable.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I'll be able to read on my tablet, as well as on my Kindle.  Works perfectly.  Very happy with product
B00004W221|1.0|The movie is awesome, yet, I'm not rating the movie but the product I bought.<br /><br />The movie description says it has 3 audio tracks available: 2 in English, 1 in Spanish. Bought this DVD from Spain since it is IMPOSSIBLE to find this movie anywhere else and what do I find when I get it? The so called &#34;Spanish&#34; audio track is just a Mexican audio track.<br /><br />There's no way I can take this movie serious while hearing the actors talking with cartoon characters voices.<br /><br />I don't think I can ask for a refund because of this, so i just wasted 20$ buying a movie I could have bought with English tracks in my own country.
B003L77TZI|5.0|My daughter was very happy to receive this for Christmas.  Excellent product, communication and shipping.  I order all my music and movies this way and am very happy.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|A fun game.  Enjoy challenging my grandkids from age 2 to 11.  They're just better at than I am! Ha Ha!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great product at a great price. Packaged and shipped proffessionally quickly arriving safely to my front door. Highly recomend this seller.
B000I186FW|1.0|There sure is a shortage of stories about totalitarian dystopias. I wish there would be more. What does this one have to offer?<br /><br />A protagonist, self-indulgent and irritating, birthed in the terrible fire of cliches about evil government science experiments and mysterious dark pasts. Some awfully subtle jabs at the political right, reminiscent in style of the the far right's own hysterical fears.<br /><br />There is some unoriginal idea of rising up against an oppressor, which falls flat as it is of a type which has no connection with the experience most viewers. It might, however, resonate with the sort of person that imagines that their unpleasant experience at the hands of mundane authority, such as having to pay a speeding ticket, is tantamount to being taken away by the Gestapo.
B00000AFFF|5.0|This album is simply the most heart-wrenching, beautiful, melodic, melancholy, wistful, and best album I have had the good luck to stumble upon.  Every song is great.  I love it.  I can't believe how genius it is.  Get this if you like drinking and listening to sad songs alone in the dark, like I do!!!  Just kidding, but not really.  Costello and Bacharach have created a truly moving listening experience.  I first listened to this album about 4 years ago and it still sounds perfect.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Completely hooked on and engrossed in these books!! I recommend them to everyone and anyone I know:-) Love, love, love!!!
B006LRUVUA|5.0|Pretty useful when I have to leave running the office and do something at my computer later. I completely recommend this!.

B0028MBKVG|4.0|These tall,lanky, indigenous people of Mexico seem to have been born to run.  They<br />don't tire easily and have unlimited stamina.  I used to see a few of these folks at the parade which preceded the annual Gallup Intertribal Ceremonial. Not too much is known about them as they live apart in a deep canyon within Mexico.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|LIKE HER SONGS, HER LYRICS, HER VOICE, VERY GOOD COLLECTION AND ENJOY IT WHILE DRIVING MY CAR. HGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ADELE FANS.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This is a fun puzzle game. Very relaxing. Fun for my son to play to. Pudding Monsters is a very good.
B008K8U13K|4.0|I used to love this game. I feel like a kid again. Playing it is fun!!!! I can't remember how to ace each stage, but, I am relearning. It's a wonderful classic game!!!!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This collection is wonderful!  I'm enjoying it just as much this time as I did the first and will the next.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I loved this book and its a real page turner. I couldn't put it down. A terrific theme. Good for book projects
B004MARLJ2|4.0|This is the game I take out to play with one of my kids when we have time to kill somewhere. The basics are easy to learn, but there's enough variety to keep the strategy interesting. Also, the story and animals are cute.<br /><br />The single-player campaign is surprisingly challenging as well.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that there's no way to save a game in progress. If you switch to another app then come back quickly, it will usually remember where you left off. After awhile, though, it will bring you back to the main application screen with no way to resume your previous game. That can be frustrating if you're playing one of the longer levels against either a human opponent or the phone.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|Poor sound quality. Bad special effects. Weak story line. Christian Bale's mouth seemed to be distorted when wearing the costume & quite frankly, Batman was a wimp. Ann Hathaway's performance as Catwoman was a lot better than Bale's. Ending, when we see \\"Robin\\" go into the Bat-cave, left it open for another yet another Batman movie, which I won't be anxiously waiting for. At least we got the rental from Amazon & $3.99 is a good price to see if a movie is actually worth buying. Very disappointing all the way around.
B008XG1X18|5.0|You can find anything you are interested in. Cooking..Sewing..Crafting... even fixing your hair to tying scarves.absolutely everything. I recommend  this site for all.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|well I wanted to play this but after downloading it doesn't want to work. Hopefully it willbe fixed so I can check it out. Maybe there will be an update to fix this sometime soon????
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Absolutely one of the best books I have read! It could have ended different ways! I loved how it ended.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I found that I loved the characters that McGuire developed and I sympathized with their faults. Looking forward to book 2!
B008XG1X18|4.0|I use my Kindle Fire.  the program works great 90% of the time.  However, the other 10% the pin will freeze and you can't post the item. OTHERWISE-I LOVE THIS PROGRAM!!!
1451695195|5.0|This is a great book. The story of Dr Alexander's journey is simply magnificent. I highly recommend this book if you care to read a story about where all our destiny's lie. I really enjoyed everything about this book.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|My son adores the Ice Age movies. He was so excited when I found this app.  Unfortunately it would never open. I tried to uninstall & reinstall several times but it never worked.  Very Disappointing!
B006T5GTK0|4.0|Well written and acted. I purchased it because of an interuption in viewing the movie while in the UK. It took quite a while to locate a DVD is US video format. Amazon cam to the rescue.
B007SGM084|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It kept my attention and I enjoyed watching their love story play out. Easy to read.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Another great read by Grisham. His writing never lets me down and leaves me wondering what his next thriller will be.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This was very entertaining. There are some laugh out loud moments. The music is great and the plot goes well with both. I was pleased with this purchase.
B00009ZYBY|5.0|What can I say? This movie is one of my absolute favorites. Happy to have it in my collection. A must see!
B009G3TNIM|5.0|My first experience listening to Converge. Very good album. If I was going to be in a band, it would definitely be Converge. Kurt Ballou is not only a great producer but he shows off his chops on this album as well. All We Love We Leave Behind seems like a coming of age album.Realizing that the immortality of youth is all but gone. Converge completes the full round of heavy music. Grind, death, doom, thrash and hardcore are present and accounted for on this eighth full length from this band. I love this album and if you like Converge, I imagine you will too
0765325950|5.0|It's enough that I purchased the hardcover;  I usually wait for soft cover/paperback, but after 3 years of waiting, I had have the book.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Lovely book. Interesting and surprising.  This book is captivating from the first word and the characters develop brilliantly.  I have not reached the ending yet.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|This kindle Fire Micros USB was just what I wanted. I was hoping it was a little longer, but I can use it well for keeping my kindle charged via usb while watching Netflix!<br /><br />Great time frame for the shipping too.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Bought for a gift, the person loves Big Bang Theory, so this was a huge hit when they opened the box!

B007I6GCT2|5.0|I bought this movie on blu-ray in used-good condition, and i'm VERY impressed.  the 3 discs themselves are in rather great condition, thecase is banged up a little bit, but nothing too badly damaged.  The movie itself is a great Trek movie!  its characters are original, but have a hint of the same characteristics of the oringinal tv show actors.  the story is at times confusing (especially during the first viewing), but overall very well told.  All the actors did great performances, and the ending was very satisfying (i perfer not to go into details, u gotta watch the movie to see what happens, of course!).  I highly recommend this movie to anyone.  whether your'e a die-hard trekker/trekkie, or someone who hasn't seen OR heard of Star Trek before and just wants to see a great movie, i think this movie will satisfy both parties.

B00A9X9ORI|2.0|The potential for what could have been done  with this movie compared to how it was just dragged out and pointless. I would have expected so much more from a Bruce Willis film. Disappointing, but if you have absolutely nothing else going on.... Waste of time.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|And these UK versions seem to be ahead of the US releases, so online is the way to go. Of course, you need to see 1&2 first
B000S9WLBY|4.0|I gave this movie 4 stars because it did everything it was supposed to do.  Did not find it exceptional, but better than most of the stuff out there.
B009V5KI98|5.0|My daughter has been singing the songs for this movie ever since we watched it.  She has also watched it approximately once per week since we got it.
B003SI6C4O|4.0|I remember being so impressed by the writing and acting for most of movie.  A little dissapointed at the end.  If you are a Denzel fan, you will not be dissapointed.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|good use of strategy and organizational skills.  Games are short and keep you engaged.  Great activity when waiting  for meetings, appts., etc.
B004ZISVWC|3.0|If you grew up believing in fairy tales and such, then it's okay.  If not, after about 40 minutes, you might get bored.  Had to watch in two parts.  Interesting characters, but not that great of actors.
B005GY0Y8S|1.0|I had a hard time getting into this book. I downloaded it for my Kindle Fire and after three attempts to read it, deleted it from my device. Very poor and shallow character development and it jumps from one thing to another. I didn't get past page 40 before dumping it. The author just doesn't convey any 'realism' to either the characters or the locations.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|Usual Ian Rankin high standard, love all his books, especially the Rebus series. Hope there are more soon, I read them faster than he can write them!
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Ted was a great movie, very funny and enjoyable. Its more<br />for adults and children over 14 years of age, IMO. Very<br />modern and abstract, adult humor. What's great about movies<br />like this is that they are actually creative and thought-out<br />unlike some movies that you are just supposed to look at the<br />main multi million dollar actor/actress.<br /><br />Total thumbs up from me.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its a great game for teaching care of horses.. or animals in general.  Gives good clear directions on what you need to do.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|I have been a Depp fan every since Who's Been Eating Gilbert Grape.<br />This movie is just boring. There is nothing really funny, or interesting.<br />Its more like seeing Johhny Depp walk around in a funny outfit<br />walking around scene to scene aimlessly.<br /><br />Badly written, waste of everyone's time, Depp's time, the producer's<br />time and most of all --- AUDIENCES.<br /><br />Again, I am such a fan of Depp and its sad that this happened but<br />you cant win them all as they say.
B0086700CM|3.0|I like how challenging the game is but don't like the lack of instructions on how one is to proceed with the game, and how some of the things you purchase with points/coins you build up.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Kind of \\"twighlight-y\\" but it kept me engaged and kept me interested. And I agree that the anticipation of the kiss was very fun.  So sad to realize these things happen to children and the author did a great job of making me empathize with good intentioned bad decisions.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Good clean fun. Pretty repetitious after while tho', at least it doesn't require purchasing more coins to play. Great for kids
B007VUA7VO|5.0|The great thing about the app is that you see everything about how much power is left depending upon what you're doing.
B0062OCNAI|5.0|I have never cried while reading a book, but this one did me in. A heartfelt and emotional tale of a mother's will to find truth to right the wrong done unto her family. It was a bit hard to grasp at first... written in both first and second person... but very moving and powerful.
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|I found the game endlessly fun.  if you love Oregon trail settler's edition, you will be addicted to playmobil pirates
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|It's better than all of the detractors are leading you to believe.<br /><br />First, click \\"skip login\\" unless you'd like to watch your Facebook videos.<br /><br />Second, you can choose where you want to watch the selected video, locally on your phone or remotely on the tv. So even without a compatible DLNA set, this app functions as a large collection of video sources which take the place of dozens of dedicated apps.
B0060AY85C|1.0|I guess I'm not a Toni Morrison fan.  I know others LOVE her, but I just couldn't get into the book.
B004V9MU86|5.0|This is a great book, looking at a difficult time of life from another outlook.  Strange to think it is written in the first person of Death, but I could certainly relate to the Book Thief herself.  Recommended you should read this one.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I love this master teller adventures and it makes enyoable reading with a twisted plot it is action and adventure as well as a master ful performance of his characters!!
B009D0LBRO|5.0|I am so glad I took a chance on this game. One of the.absolute funnest games out there for android.<br /><br />Once I got it, this provided me with many hours of entertainment and enjoyment. I have played it so much I have obtained all 50 teeth and all 4500 Lums.<br /><br />The levels are so cleverly designed, it'sa true joy to keep replaying them for that perfect score.<br /><br />Some levels are challenging, but it makes the reward all that much sweeter when you finally nail it, and know that you persevered through the challenge.<br /><br />Definitely buy this game if you are looking for something different, something with great art, level design, and fast action based gameplay. The controls are unbeleivably simple, tap left side of screen to jump (anywhere just about) and tap and hold to hover, and tap right side of the screen to punch.<br /><br />That's all there is to it, the rest is all about timing, reflexes, and anticipation. Trust me, super easy to learn, super fun to play, super awesome art and level design. Try it!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Enjoy this DVD , good buy ... Would buy another product  just like this.....I would tell a friend about this product
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|I enjoyed this movie lots of twists and great action.  Never saw the original entirely but the Husband said this is better!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Anything by Susan  Boyle is great. She has a very pleasantvoice that's easy to listen to..<br />Even my husband like it.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Found game to be really fun to play. First time through was a bit tough but looking forward to playing again and again.
B00979CS50|5.0|Neil and Crazy Horse are masters of heartfelt music and rock improvisation. Incredible sound (for a CD) and excellent songs. You like Neil? Get this now!
B007V5CF5K|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this game!  Like others have said it's not too hard but not to easy either.  I'm a working mom with 2 small kids so I don't have much time for gaming or much of a brain left over at the end of the day so I really enjoyed some of the features they use to lead you through the game.  I don't have days to spend trying to get through one level of a game because I overlooked some obscure clue.  I also liked the fact that if the game crashes, it auto reboots and doesn't loose more than one step.  Graphics are awesome and worth the lengthy download.  Off to download the second one!
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|I'm quite please with this app. It allows my to stream videos from my Samsung Note 2 to my old plasma tv through my Apple TV. My only complaint is that the video buffering is not quite right. I need to pause the video at start so the buffering gets far enough ahead to prevent video playback from stalling. Another slight complain that is that when first launching the app I thought it was hung. Turns out I needed to swipe screen to manually progress through a series of intro and/or setup screens.<br /><br />UPDATE:  To clarify, I only need to pause when streaming video from my phone to TV. Video streamed from the web works without any problems.
1451695187|2.0|Didn't like the idea of being in muddy jello and not caring about  it. He said he lost  the human element when he was in there and saw scary animal faces and heard frightening sounds. That definitely will make someone afraid to pass on.He was the lucky one that found a light being but what about those who don't have the option  to come back. Are they doomed to stay in that muddy jello?
1440503257|5.0|I bought this for Christmas last year for my youngest daughter and she was very happy to receive it.  She can cook at 18 and she was looking forward to trying the recepies in the book.
1401322786|5.0|Loved it. Makes you really thing how we waste so much time and how we don't appreciate the time we have here.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|Love Michael Buble's style and wit.  We have several of his CD's and are never disappointed.  Smooth style charm and wit.
B00065MDRW|5.0|I found this e-music as good as I remembered King Crimson being in my younger years. It's been hard to find and Amazon offered many renditions. I definitely recommend Amazon to friends and family for their music needs and wants. Thank you.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Lindsey Stirling is amazing.  I can't get enough of her music.  Highly recommended.  She is a violinist extraordinaire!  Check her out.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Of course, any book by Stephen King is awesome.  I have read basically all of them; I love fiction!<br /><br />This story has a historical twist, centered around the JFK shooting.  But it also involves time travel, and the possible impact on space/time and the universe as we know it.<br /><br />Entertaining, as always!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I was  hooked from the get go and loved all the twists to the story. Biggest disappointment was the ending. Not sure what I expected to happen but it was a bit of a let down.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|In addition to descriptive sexual content the story was very interesting. The characters were fascinating. Their lifestyles were fascinating.it certainly held my interest!
B003YOZNBK|3.0|Josh is great. But Malkovich doing the same cliche of the super-villain cruel enough to destroy the world I really get tired of. Megan playing a prostitute (what a news!) who is really in love of the super hero... or the anti hero (the same thing anyway) gives nothing away to the story.<br /><br />The legion of extraordinary gentlemen came to my head... or The Shanghai Knights... or whatever movie set in the past whose story has to do with ultra tech to destroy the world (Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes included), this is the stuff that sucks, really.<br /><br />However, the Hex's mythology is OK, I really loved it, and Brolin does a good job. Fassenberg, well, he is Fassenberg (if you love him you love him, if you don't just ignore him).<br /><br />Anyway, a Western comic is a worth, I am tired of ET's and cute kids doing good to humanity or playing vamps!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very easy and fun to read. I finished all 3 books in a week. Perfect if your looking for a little adventure in yoir lifr.
B0018QPPXW|5.0|this movie is better than many movies produced today. you shouldn't miss it either. strongly recommend it. good, good, good
0571238343|5.0|One of the best 2D animation books i ever read,<br />it shows you what you want to know about movements and motion Great Book.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Extremely satisfied with the way it works I would recommend this product and I would buy another one if the need arises
B000BW7QWW|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time! The show Firefly was excellent and the movie based on the show is even better. A very fresh story for sci-fi fans.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I purchased 2 of these for my kids phones, not for the supposed waterproof claims but because I thought they would be sturdy and last. I was so wrong!!! First, the clear plastic front cover sucks because its not a tight, smooth fit so trying to type is a nightmare. Next, these cases can't withstand a 3 foot fall without cracking. Total disappointment.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|If you love Mahjong... you'll love this version! Many different boards to choose from. I want to keep playing just to see how fast I can go.
1903025613|5.0|This is not a review of the novel itself, (which is wonderful) but of the Winchester Austen Edition (henceforth WAE) of Pride and Prejudice, published by Word Press in 2007.<br /><br /> After buying a copy of WAE &#34;Emma&#34; in Costco, I knew I had to have &#34;Pride & Prejudice&#34; in WAE as well.  Here's why:<br /><br />-The WAE versions of Jane Austen's books are hardcover and physically comfortable in that they are printed on smooth white paper rather than typical beige rough paper and the typeface is solid roman type that is easy on the eyes.<br /><br />-The size is approximately 5X8. The corners of the pages are rounded giving it a soft look.  The covers of all WAE, are  completely black, except for the title and author and  also have rounded corners.  Attached to the back cover is an elastic band that  goes around the height of the book and you can use this as a book mark or as a way to keep your book closed.<br /><br />-Each WAE novel has colorful inside covers depicting a scene from the novel and there are nice color drawings included in the introduction.<br /><br />-Each novel has at least three sets of notes written by Austen scholars.  Most of the notes are the same in all the novels, but each novel has one additional note section peculiar to that novel.  The notes that all editions have are a timeline in color of Jane Austen's world and a color map of Austen's England. In P&P the additional notes is the illustrated Army in Austen's time.<br /><br />I bought used copies of WAE novels because even used, they are sturdy and comfortable.  I am very hard on books by intention.  I read while I eat, before I sleep,  while waiting on lines, etc. But mainly, I like to embellish my books with beads, ribbons and lace, and even some rubber stamping on the white spaces in the text itself.  I wouldn't have the heart to do that to an expensive hardcover.<br /><br />If you like the &#34;feel&#34; of books, I highly recommend the Winchester Austen Edition of any ofAusten's novels.  Let me know what you think.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|Cleared some of my doubts on steve jobs :D. Good read and well written. Looking forward to read more books
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss wowed us with his last book Name of the Wind. In his second book he really lets the characters develop and grow into something more. People may point and prod at some sections because they don't feel it was necessary but his way of making a character round and 3D showing you his flaws and his struggles really makes you fall in love with Kvothe. I am patiently waiting for his next book and to see where the story takes us.
B001BKTEZA|4.0|I wanted to read a highly acclaimed novel and picked this one. It took me a little bit to get used to the dialect, but once it came I read through it pretty fast. My family is from the Appalachian mountains in Kentucky. This book gave me a new appreciation for the poor, the destitute, and how labor organizations came to exist.  I imagined my gparents going thru similar trials to feed their family. Labor unions are getting a bad rap, but now it is clear to me that greed and little respect for fellow man necessitated their existence.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|For any of you who haven't heard of Name of the Wind or Patrick Rothfuss, please get your head out from under the rock you live in. This is an amazing read that will keep you up late into the night just trying to finish the next chapter after chapter. Patrick Rothfuss is fast becoming a Tolkien of this era and with the second book already out and a cult following, we can expect to see many more great things from him.<br /><br />Name of the Wind is a great tale of how a boy goes on his way through life, a journey through fantasy, and how sometimes life isn't all rainbows and butterflies. Kvothe is one of the most interesting characters of today and his journey that he recounts is an amazing, unforgettable adventure that breaks the laws of storytelling.

B00932A2MC|4.0|Streaming HD is not going to beat the quality of a Blueray disc any time soon. Too many variables cause degradation. I was pleased with the overall experience but will be going to Redbox  for movie rentals, and it will be much cheaper.

B0063IH60K|4.0|I do like that it works both verticly and horizontly. and that it easy to<br />undo a move if I find a better one.
0345803485|5.0|After reading the first book, I wanted to buy the whole set.  I am keeping this set for later reading again.  Don't know what all the hoopla was about.  Thanks for having it available.  Order was filled quickly and arrived in good condition
B008JGSM6G|4.0|At first I thought this would be easy but,as I leveled up I found it a challenge<br />to cover the whole board or to link the colors without isolating another. I keep<br />coming back to this game more and more thank you.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Got it for my girls but now I play too. It's a cute game we like it. Girls are four and five
B004WGIXX4|1.0|I actually like Kutcher and Portman, so I expected to enjoy this flirty, little flick.  Only it wasn't all that flirty and I didn't enjoy it at all.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|it's fun to play this game or at least my nine year old thinks so.  what more can a guy say
0765325950|1.0|I don't care how good the book is or how much I want to read it, having it only available in print in this digital age is a travesty.  I've waited years for the ending of the Wheel of Time. A few more months won't hurt.

0525478817|5.0|Wow, to describe this book is nearly impossible. There is no doubt that John Green is a gifted writer.<br /><br />You will laugh, you will cry and you'll repeat it again and again. You will not be able this book down after reading the first chapter. I read the book in one day. And I will read it again. My favorite scene... when Hazel Grace revealed her \\"Disney's Wish\\" to her friend, Augustus Waters. I laughed and laughed.<br /><br />Hazel Grace & Augustus Waters are unforgetable characters and you will enjoy watching their friendship grow from the staring contest at their first meeting and you will stay with them until the end of their story. And what and ending it was. It it utterly unforgetable. I can see why this book was the #1 New York Times Besteller in 2012.<br /><br />I hope the passage below from John Green's book will encourage you to read it :)<br /><br />Gus's father: \\"Our children are weird\\".<br />My dad: \\"Nicely phrased.\\"<br />~ from the Fault in Our Stars.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I'm using the app on a Samsung GS2, and I'm enjoying it, but with the 4.3 inch acreen you have to scroll a lot...

B00APUYWYA|5.0|Wife and I thought it was hilarious! Officially thought it would be boring but I was everything. We had a great laugh and the kids loved it too.
B0086700CM|1.0|My son put this on my tablet and I tried it once and really didn't like it. It's a game and if you like  that type of game fine. I don't like that type of game so not.
B00ATSBIIG|3.0|I like this game it was fun and challenging.  I did not like where the piece selection place is.  It is often difficult to pick up pieces especially during the speed round.  I got so frustrated during the speed round because my finger would bump the start menu.  I also did not like that I could not scroll through the pieces.  I have finished the puzzles twice and still can't get into the bonus puzzles.<br /><br />The game does not always save my play so I have to start all over.  VERY FRUSTRATING.  I am sorry I paid full price for this game, it would be a good free game but the overall performance is not acceptable for pals game.  I feel like if I pay for it should work as advertised.  It also uses up a lot of power and it is very slow moving going from screen to screen.
B00005ASOC|5.0|Happened on this via our new online Netflix ....  Fantastic movie.  If you liked Scent of a Woman (underdog's mentor gives snooty prep school admin  what-for), you may like this.  We liked it enough to buy it for our home movie library.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Couldn't put down, read all of them in a 10 day span. I would recommend this book to any one.
B006CS7UXO|5.0|I love this collection of B-sides. Gotta love the album tracks and singles but as Chris and Neil have said the B-sides can cut a bit deeper into things and really are a deeper connection with the fans. The songs can reveal much more because they're not really about appealing to a commercial sense and audience as much. Being commercially appealing with things isn't bad or wrong but it's wonderful to show that you have deeper ideals as well, as PSB does in these tracks. Be it on personal thoughts, feelings, situations, and general happenings. B-sides can be so much more experimental too and they do try their hand at different things while at the same time not being so self indulgent that they release substandard material. They're very self aware and know where good and bad lie. So it's a very wonderful compilation of B-sides that show a deeper and wider side. The question for some fans would be B before A? I would say you could implement some of both and have the greatest and perfect album ever made.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Better than I think I was expecting, in content anyways. The writing style kind of made me sad because I think it could have been so much better, but overall a decent story.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Played fine with both my nexus 7 and Galaxy S2.<br />Liked :<br />Simple but challenging gameplay<br />Lot of levels (this game lasted me one month full by playing with an hour a day)<br />Superb music and excellent graphics. I love it.<br />No battery drainer<br /><br />Missed to have:<br />Bonus levels<br />Extra power for each crystal would have been nice<br /><br />No cons to mention I have.
B004V9MU86|5.0|This book gives a look at what happend in Germany which we  English people don't usually think about. Sorry but I didn't know that is what happened there
B00070DK1E|5.0|I had the tape now the CD some songs from rock island but thats ok by me its better this way! thanks
B004HD61KE|4.0|The story told is very intriguing, involving real facts to make the fiction more believable. I bought the book on a whim, but quickly found myself unable to put it down. It is action packed from cover to cover, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The ONLY reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the first half of the book is peppered with typos and awkward sentences. There are a few in the last half, though not as many. It probably wouldn't bother most readers, but it pulled me right out of the story every time, as most were mistakes a grade school child could point out. Granted, it is more a matter of editing than storytelling, but there you go. Still, I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys a bit of fantasy with their history.
B0073XORCY|5.0|kick ass what a CD nice sound grate shape enjoy it! it a long time but happy to have it from the master IAN ANDERSON,

B003TJR2HS|5.0|So far, so good. Fits our docking station and works very well with my iPhone 4 (which is in a heavy duty Otter Box case). Allows me to play my phone through the docking station without removing the case, which is exactly what I wanted.

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I've got to say I'm a big fan of diary of a wimpy kid and this one of the best ones yet. Good job and keep it coming with the new diary of a wimpy kid books.
B005LAII80|4.0|I went into this movie with fairly high expectations based on all the positive reviews and have to say that it did not disappoint.  Not an all time classic or ground breaking in any way but a solid entertaining action sci fi movie. Its rated R, so for those that don't like graphic violence then this will not be your cup of tea. I was never a big fan of the Dredd comic book but I really liked this movie because of the quick pace and non stop action.  The movie was direct and to the point, no cheesy emotional bantering or cliched ra-ra super hero shenanigans, or deep artistic symbolic messages, it was just a solid action flick with cool weapons and killer fight scenes (the use of slow motion is really sweet, especially if you are watching it in 3D).  One thing to note for any 3D enthusiasts out there, the aspect ratio of the blu ray is such that it will not fill in the entire screen on a widescreen hdtv, meaning you will have black bars at the top and bottom of the screen which diminishes the 3D somewhat but not enough to reduce the enjoyment of the movie.  Its still a top notch 3D spectacle.
1439127700|5.0|Only 43 men have served as president in our more than two centuries under the Constitution.  It is one of the world's most exclusive clubs, and only those who have served in the office know just how challenging the job is.  In \\"The Presidents Club,\\" authors Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy examine the relationships of presidents with their predecessors going back to the mid-20th century.<br /><br />The authors show how ex-presidents come to empathize with their successors, regardless of party, due to the demands of the job--in the words of George H.W. Bush, \\"No matter the politics, you know and understand the weight of the decisions the other guy had to make, and you respect that.\\"  After presidents are in office, they learn quickly how much they are constrained by the decisions made by their predecessors; Jimmy Carter relates that not only was he constrained daily not only by Gerald Ford's decisions, but also by decisions made by Harry Truman decades earlier.<br /><br />Going back to the relationship between Truman and Herbert Hoover, this volume describes relationships that presidents from different parties and presidents from the same party have had with each other and how they worked on issues facing the country.  Presidents reached out for their predecessors most often in matters of foreign policy, and the book discusses how chief executives worked together during events such as the Bay of Pigs and Vietnam, as well as situations involving the Middle East.<br /><br />As time passes, presidents long out of office in some cases view members of the club differently, leading to surprising friendships, such as those between Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford and between Bush Sr. and Bill Clinton.  Many of the stories recounted in the book will be familiar to political junkies, but there are untold others that you have likely never heard, making \\"The Presidents Club\\" a rewarding read for anyone with a strong interest in politics or the presidency.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Good read. Somewhat depressing, but what do you expect in a book about Kennedy's death. It was different than I thought, but very well done. I loved how SK tied in other novels, like IT, into the story.

B000FBFN1U|5.0|I loved it. If you have seen the series Storm of Swords is season 3.  So well written love the characters.
B0053O89JM|5.0|Super entertainment for the price. This selection is in my opinionis by far the best of the House series. Season 8 of House, M.D. DVD series was received directly after purchase. Seller was very involved in the postal tracking and took personal interest in my purchase. I anticipated a much later arrival date and the DVD set arrived in new looking condition and they're still being watched. I'm looking forward to buying more of these products...also fine gifts to friends. Great investment. Very impressed, I intend to continue as one of their customer's. Thank you !
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Fifty shades of gray was not my type of book. Oregon experment didn't stay conected, White Bow was very good and followed her life verry well<br /><br />Port moturary was not one of her better books
0439023513|5.0|I loved this series. It's a very exciting story with romance, action and suspense. I would have read it if it had been 1000 pages and wanted more!
B004EPZ06G|1.0|Loved the first one, but this one really fell below par.  I had expected a whole lot more, based on what I had read from critics.
0439023491|5.0|I absolutely loved this series! It has everything you would want in a story- romance, intrigue, action, suspense. I was hooked from the first page!
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|Cary Grant during his best film days - love the airplane & the corn field chase scene and seeing Mt. Rushmore as a backdrop

B001GKJ2FM|5.0|Love the music - poor Pierce Brosnan (probably should never to another singing role but at least he gave it his all) - wonderful dance numbers and just plain fun
B000HLFOOE|4.0|I wanted the story &#34; The Capricorn Stone&#34;. It was really good. I read a couple of the other stories also.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|As much fun, if not more, than the first one in this series!  If you liked the first one, get this one immediately
B00005N6KG|5.0|Without doubt, Sony makes the best headphones for MP3 and other media devices.  This is the second pair I've owned and they are great. They are so light weight you forget you have them on your head. They don't fall off, at least not very often when you bend over. The balance between left and right are always spot on.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with these headphones.
B004LWZW4C|4.0|Clever prequel story, depicting the early friendship of Charles Xavier and Eric Lensher, and their gradually growing differences, set effectively against the background of the Cuban Missile Crisis of the early 1960s. The historical background is used well, with evil mutants stirring up mistrust between the Americans and the Soviets while an uneasy alliance of good mutants and the U.S. government try to stop them. The mixing of actual news footage with CGI warships works well, especially in the climactic battle. The cast is excellent, top to bottom, especially James McAvoy as the young Professor X.  You don't have to be versed in X-Men lore to enjoy the movie. However, long time X-Fans will find several nice tie-ins to the first X-Men movie, and a likeable, believable beginning to the X-Men saga.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I listen to one or more of the various sounds nightly. I enjoy blending various sounds for my own distinct &quot; cocktail &quot;. some of the sounds do sound alike but there are enough sounds that are unalike to help keep product interesting.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|This is the dredd people will like from the start and to its AWSOME finish !! For all of us that we're duped with that god awful Stallone flick this is DREDD the best movie adaptation of a great comic Karl urban is dredd and there is no one in my opinion that can be this good at making a character watchable with a helmet on the entire movie and make it believable and charismatic , urban made this his own and for that I thank him.
B001JU4S44|4.0|When you watch an action movie, any action movie, a certain amount of what is called \\"belief suspension\\" is required.  Most action movies have ridiculous, insane and just down-right impossible moments.  The car chase between Cruise and Nyha, which a lot of reviewers seem to not get, is her way of making Cruise prove himself worthy of her time and intelligence.  The movie gets across exactly what it needs to; a douche wants to make money by hurting people, Cruise has a love interest which could end sourly and states that being a total cock-knuckle will almost surely end in you getting your ass handed to you in a fiery and epic way.  Nice wire-work with all the flips, cool driving and a lot of guns.  If nothing less it is a good movie for some popcorn, a big screen and killer surround-sound.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Great read some parts tiresome with long descriptions but lovely classical novel<br />Recommended to those who have patience for long read
0345803493|5.0|In this second book, from the moment Christian comes into the picture, he is a transformed person. More loving, more of everything. Ana, on the other hand becomes a stronger person but still has a bit of submissiveness in her. Just a little to keep the fun going in the red room of pain and the rest of their sexual escapades.<br /><br />The courtship in any relationship is the most exciting part and in this book, EL James shows just that. Christian wants a second chance and he begins another passionate physical affair with Anastasia. I was so thrilled when he finally realized that he has fallen for her. I was even more thrilled when he finally said I LOVE YOU to her.<br /><br />It was enlightening to see him open up about his past to Anastasia in this book. The fact that EL James added a character who was a threat to Christian and Anastasia added an exciting yet dangerous element to the book. It gave the story a twist that I did not expect to see.<br /><br />Loved the scene when he put on Roberta Flack's, \\"the first time I saw your face\\" in the red room of pain, so romantic and that he chose such a beautiful moment to fill the room with Roberts's soulful voice.<br /><br />A lot of readers thought that the second book had too many sex scenes but this is CHRISTIAN GREY! This is what he does and excels in doing so. To me, the sex has to be there to make the reader realize that this is what brings him and Anastasia even closer compared to the 1st book. You think that Christian is a sex animal but look at Anastasia. The BDSM side of it brought out the sex animal in Anastasia! She couldn't get enough of it and to my surprise, was even asking for it. It was gratifying to see Anastasia discover a side of her that she never thought she had.<br /><br />It was a joy to see that someone like Christian who has such a tormented past was able to find someone like Anastasia who loves him and at the same time enjoys the kinky side of sex with him.<br /><br />The very, very last partof the book was my favorite when he finally gave Anastasia his \\"hearts and flowers\\" proposal. After that, I couldn't wait to get onto the third book.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|First class writing, great character development with an excellent plot and plot devices. I was re-reading Songs of Fire and Ice and I had just finished Book Three, A Storm of Swords and I needed a break.  I didn't get much of a break.  Different styles but very little slowing or lowering of the quality of the writing.  Anthony Ryan is sure to be a force to be reckoned with in this field.  Looking forward with great anticipation to his next book
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I loved this show bak in high school and I still love it now. Whenever I watch this show I feel soo good. Everything about it is jus<br />real, the characters are relatable and the story lines arent ridiculous like most of the crap they have out today. I recommend this show to everyone I know. You wont regret watching, if anything you'll become addicted to it like I still am =)
B003YL4LYI|5.0|A lot of characters but the story is a little loose.  Still, on his worst days, George R.R.Martin writes a better book than almost anyone writing fantasy.  I think that this could  easily have been part of Book Four rather than a free standing Book Five. However  I just read them not write them.  Even if it is the weakest of the five it is still very good and worth every minute spent reading it.  I am afraid that it will be a while for Books 6,7, and 8.  Too bad.
B009JZVT70|5.0|The show comes on while I am not at home. Better to purchase it than miss it. Don't have a way to record so this works great!!!

B008M34INW|3.0|I liked it It was funny and action packed . Mel Gibbons always delivers a good movie even if he is not that good in real life.
B00005N5S2|3.0|This is an enjoyable 90-minutes so long as one accepts it is a TV-quality dramatization, limited to General MacArthur's experiences in World War II.  Like many geniuses, MacArthur was an equally flawed person with a highly-inflated view of his value to mankind.<br />This would have 10-times better if MacArthur's entire life had been covered, beginning from before he entered West Point, to his retirement.  That was truly interesting!

B0054LJGWS|4.0|The electronic version misses all the really funny footnotes!  Which, I am not happy with, however I enjoyed the book overall a great deal.  This was my very first electronic book - I also was reading the physical book from the library.  The story is fun, easy to read and highly entertaining.
B0099TJ4YQ|5.0|Perfect-who could not love JT who is the world's best singer man and such a comfort on a winter night.
B004R2DS9C|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my son & he loves it!  Great for storing star wars stuff & also using as a play-mat. Easy for him to open & close too!! I would recommend this to a friend!
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Just what I expected-I bought it for my sister who enjoyed listening to mine. Love Buble good singer sweetheart. Long career ahead
0061537969|5.0|Fantastic novel written from a dog's perspective. Enzo is a very believable canine narrator. He'll have you whining,barking, panting and begging for more. A true dog's tale. 5 Paws UP!!!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Dirty little book that is good for a 15 minute read then go to sleep. Predictable and funny. Hope the heroine survives her ordeal
0307463745|5.0|Excellent book, refreshing expression of ideas. Nothing really new for me in here, but a great book for me to share with my very affluent business coaching clients.
B00AHCF9E8|3.0|This is the edited version and the songs that have bad language were edited to cut the f-word out and all. I am used to hearing cusswords so this version didn't do it for me. I went back and spent an extra 3 dollars for the songs with explicit language. The explicit version is much better. anything is better unedited!
B000FC1RCI|5.0|Agatha Christie is known as the best mystery writer of all time, and this work proves her status to the fullest.

B00338QENI|5.0|This book was a selection for a book club I am in.  I have to say it is one of my favorite books I have read in years.
B001929D38|5.0|Great band! Great album! I love this &#34;cd&#34;!  Some songs are a little slower than Green Day's so it may just be a person to person thing but I like it!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Excellently to see the movie<br />Challenging strategy suspense moving.  Enjoyed the book and adventure s<br />Is there books to follow and read
B00A12VW86|5.0|This isn't as good as American Idiot but it's still good! Don't compare it to other Green Day albums. Just listen to it and enjoy!
B000SEGUDE|5.0|What an incredible novel.  A smart rollercoaster of time and characters.  Loved it from front to back.  Looking forward to some other works by Mr. Mitchell.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Good, addictive game!! The app itself runs well and has not given me any problems on my kindle fire hd.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Great show, written well and very good choice of actors,  I am always telling others to watch. I have it on Amazon so that every series is there for me when I have time to just enjoy something I want to watch and not channel hop the TV guide.
B00000AOUD|3.0|Not as good as aqualung but still a good CD.  I like to have good music when I am cruising around the lake.  Thanks
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Interesting to learn flower language. Loved the descriptions.<br />Was hard to follow at times with flashbacks.<br />It was a good read.<br />Recommend it to anyone who likes flowers.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This series is so romantic and unnerving at the same time...could not put it down. I hope it is not the end of the Grey saga. I love it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Winter of the word.Connected to families and their destinies get insight to major historical developments .cant wait for book nr 3
B009KS4XRO|3.0|There's been several times the game has abruptly ended to &#34;clean a room&#34; just as I'm about to receive winnings.  Kinda' takes the fun out of it.
006198969X|5.0|Great tips. If you are a Lauren Conrad fan than you will really love this book. Helpful tips with her writing flair!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I have been a fan of American Horror Story since season one and it keeps getting better.  I love that the characters and location change with each season.  This season takes place in an insane asylum run by the Catholic Church.  If you are interested in being shocked, horrified and surprised, this is the show for you.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|...wanting more.  I love the thought of what Salander could do with the rest of her life.  This book brought it all together and I couldn't imagine a better ending but, oh the possibilities for her future.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Fast paced, showed how hard as parents it is to see our children as they really are.  Good book!
1439102813|3.0|Lisa Genova, the author of \\"Still Alice,\\" has a Ph.D. in neuroscience and works as a columnist for the National Alzheimer's Association.  Her novel tells the story of a 50-year-old Harvard psychology professor, with a happy marriage and three grown, successful children, who is diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's disease and over the course of two years experiences serious cognitive decline.  Genova made the bold decision to tell the story from Alice perspective, and while the novel is not entirely successful--in places the writing is more clinical than literary, and there are certainly moments of melodrama--overall, it's a moving and very sad book.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|This book is fast reading.<br /> I love his style it easy to read and has a good plot.  Also like the suspense he creates.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and very addicting.  I like it a lot more than than temple run.  I would definitely recommend it.

B009HQ9UHC|4.0|My kids love this game! It really challenges their thinking and problem solving skills. My 4yo loves to build the buggies!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|West Wing This set is now very hard to find. Nice to be able to watch whenever I want to.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Loved the first two books but could not get into this one.  Actually scanned through much of the last section of the book, just too gruesome and did not like so many of the characters being killed.  I had not planned to read this trilogy but was curious enough to do so anyway.  Am anxious to discuss  with others who have read the series!
B009329ZF2|4.0|Boys enjoyed the movie so much, they wanted it.  Order came ahead of schedule and in the new condition as expected.  Getting a lot of mileage out of it.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Enjoyed all the layers of the film, as well as the cast of actors made it that much more enjoyable. A Light very heart warming feel good movie
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Enjoyed it from start to finish. Read it in one sitting and really liked the ending.  I recommend it .....
B006LSZECO|4.0|Told from 2 points of view, which kept it interesting. Absolutely insane story that anyone who has ever had a marital spat should read. Surprise ending!
B009IRVSVQ|3.0|Most of the songs I enjoyed, but the vulgarity of one song in particular makes me wonder if parents are listening to their children's choice of music and are these lyrics really necessary to getting across the message the song is trying to convey?
B005IQZB14|4.0|This was a unanimous book club pick.  Not many people have what it takes to go out on their own, without the security of all that they've always known.  Cheryl takes it to the extreme, and tells the story beautifully.  I imagine the people we would be if we all truly lived up to our potential.
0691142165|2.0|I have had textbooks that were better written than this. Seems mostly like a data dump presented to the reader.  Paul Krugman is much better.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|I downloaded this app to my Kindle, but when I attempted opening anything using it, it locked up the whole machine.  Pretty much worthless...  But I will also say that Adobe Reader on other products such as my PC is great so I hate knocking this product, but it just didn't work on my Fire...
B003XCVQ3C|2.0|I was thrilled when I first got the adapter and it worked great.  Then yesterday (one year to the day I purchased it) it quit working.  Three months ago the positioning of the adapter started getting finicky, sometimes it wouldn't work sometimes it would.<br /><br />I paid $35 for it - the adapter should have lasted longer than exactly 1 year.<br /><br />Not thrilled anymore.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|What the f***. The game is fun but theres only 1 map. If i were you i would save the 1.26$
B00632HWOG|5.0|Of course I love it, I have to have it to see my email, You cant go too wrong with yahoo
B004UID2LC|5.0|A you tube lover unable to access the site on Kindle is a a frustrating thing. This free app made it possible, and no complicated tweaking needed!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|SO very relaxing, So neat that you can choose several different ones at once to play like, storm, wind, rain, and windchimes!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a very fun and addicting game. Works well and no bugs so far. Great for passing time and not boring.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book was amazing it was like a fairytale a weird one that had a different kind if happy ending but still a fairytale. This book was hard for me to put down I didn't  want it to end  I was hooked. THIS BOOK WAS PLAIN AND SIMPLY AMAZING AND A DEFINITE NEED TO READ.
