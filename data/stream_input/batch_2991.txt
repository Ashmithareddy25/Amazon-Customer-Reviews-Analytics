B008Y212PI|3.0|But it will do. I only get four mistakes before it makes me start over, which I don't like,  but that can be turned off. Also the paint and  destroy buttons are too close together so Iend up crushing instead of painting so I have to start over, but the puzzles are  pretty relaxing.
B002RMVAZ8|3.0|I read the story of Hamlet. It was ok to watch but too long. I lost interest but kept watching it.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Always enjoy David Baldacci and this was not disapointing. Enjoyed the characters and the plot. Definitely worth the money! Will buy another.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|I do not like the way it set up. I truly did not like this app. I prefer if it was just 2 ppl playning
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This game is really fun to play, the characters are so cute and the song that you can unlock is hilarious and catchy. I had to get this game...My daughter(21 yrs old) had gotten it for her iPhone 4s and showed it to me. She loves the game too! The game is easy to start playing and others crack up watching you play, especially when you have to blow on the screen to keep the plane from crashing! (I still think that is amazing that it actually works!) The main objective is to keep your character from dying in many different ways, such as getting electrocuted while getting toast from a toaster or having piranhas eat your lower body parts. Definitely worth getting!
B00BKTFABE|1.0|I feel the need not to take pictures on my Kindle Fire HD because i have to put myself in an awkward position to take the picture. It is good if you are taking pictures of yourself. I choose not to use this app anymore. I will not use my device to take picture.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Something to keep the children busy for hours trying to beat each other's score and the scenery is too funny.
1558908382|5.0|Neurotic hitman John Cusack, what more could you want<br /><br />Best line of the whole movie.....in regards to a high school reunion- &#34;It's as if everybody swelled&#34;
B001O54NHQ|5.0|Part of this year's Halloween costume theme, this music suits both mood and theme perfectly.  Although this was a concept album for the movie the songs are very catchy and typical of the sound of the late 80s.
B00FEN1C50|3.0|It was a 3 star movie. Like the one reviewer said like the old godzilla type but new version. Very dark to watch. Why did they make it so dark, hard to see.<br />Only 3 stars, that's it.
B0031R5K72|5.0|The Book Thief is a beautifully written book about the coming of age of a young German girl, Liesel Meminger, in a small town during World War II.  The story is narrated by Death. Even though the story is filled with tragedy and loss, the author has managed to somehow not to make this story a morbid and depressing read.  When I finished the book, I immediately reopened it and starting reading it again.  That is how good this book is.
B001C3I4UM|5.0|This is a real work of art. I can't think of any modern albums that are true concept albums -  but then again, today's music can't come close in comparison to 60's & 70's music.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Is a great shower we always love watching it!  I Would recommend it to anyone. I wouldn't say it was for little kids though maybe age 10 and above
1568814518|5.0|This book has challenging but clear directions.  The end pieces I produced are truly cool. I teach art to middle schoolers, a few of the picked up the book and made some great origami.
B00DEFW8YY|5.0|The two Brahms piano concertos present a singular challenge to the soloist and orchestra. The music is tempestuous and poetic by turns and the orchestra in no way defers to the soloist. In fact, often both are playing together at full volume, which makes balancing the voices quite difficult. The piano part is muscular in both pieces -- in the first movement of the first concerto, those crashing chords must be a physical challenge. And in the scherzo of the second concerto, the base thunders out in some of the most thrilling octaves in the music dictionary.<br /><br />So the issue is, how to blend the tough and the tender, the muscular and the lyrical, the ying and the yang? Helene Grimaud, I think, succeeds brilliantly in this. There is a special tone she brings to the keyboard. Her attack is so precise and concentrated and those chords are so incisive. One feels, even when the music is at its most impassioned, that there is something she is holding back. She compels our attention through her voice.<br /><br />This music runs the gamut of human emotion. The playful final movement of the second concerto, the tragic sobbing of the cello solo in the slow movement, the driving momentum of the last movement of the first concerto .... and most of all the first movements of both pieces. The horn solo that opens number two is met with a lovely rising arpeggio from the piano followed by an imitation of the theme. That little phrase, which is not technically difficult, is so hard to pull off just right. Grimaud nails it. The piano entry in the first concerto -- a little refrain after the tempest of the orchestral tutti, can get lost in the storm but not here. It commands our attention. It tells us that the piano is going to tell a different story -- passion and power yes but also tenderness.<br /><br />I highly recommend these discs by one of the most interesting interpreters of our age. Grimaud, unlike some of her peers, is not one of those virtuosi whose interests are confined to the piano. She's not a machine devoted to reeling off concertos and whose life takes place solely in the practice room. Grimaud is a citizen of the world with a passionate interest in the environment and the natural world. That wide concern for all of life and for the earth we share is reflected in her music-making. She makes the music seem universal because her mind ranges so widely and her interests are so encompassing.<br /><br />Music does not take place in a vacuum and is much more than a series of notes,  whether loud or soft. These Brahms concertos are a statement about life from the composer, transmitted through the skill, commitment and understanding of this wonderful musician.ned to the piano.

B00BVMXBDO|5.0|Everyone on the five-star train wrote it much better than I can.  Someone recommended this series to me and they're now my best friend.  As one reviewer put it......  You just can't review without spoilers.  Lead actress is incredible and the storyline is riveting.  I just can't believe they're making me WAIT for more episodes.  :)
B0011ZVPK2|4.0|Some new changes here that make these recordings unique. A pleasure. A must have for any Eagle fan. Thank You once again.
B006C51Y7K|5.0|This was full of nostalgic music, brought me back to the time when my love was for making models. This was a great movie: full of all the unlikely heroes, unlikely villains, and had a great ending for all that the writers intended you to &#34;get into their character.&#34;
B0040I09RM|5.0|Great series and Prime allowed me to catch up on all seasons bring me current with series 6 which is airing now. Love it!
B00ANA27IU|5.0|perfect sci-fi. classic vision and imaginative ideas. you should read the whole series. it says i need to use seven more words.
B001RCD2DW|5.0|I've owned both the Sennheiser Hd800 and the Audeze LCD 3 headphones before and sold them both, as I really didn't see a dramatic difference in sound quality as some reviews say, on both of these phones as compared to the AKG K702 . I've listened to all three through my Burson Soloist SS amp to compare them together.<br />Sure they sound better, with the Hd800's 3D imaging and soundstage and the LCD 3's up close and lively sound, but at 5 to 7 x the price, they don't sound 5 to 7x better, or is the AKG K702's 5 to 7 x worse. Price differences even that high only provide small gains in sound improvement return.<br />The build quality on the Akg702 is excellent as is the intricate and wide spacious detailed sound which is around 80% of the Sennheiser hd800 for only 1/5 the cost. And they are made in Vienna Austria. These really need a high quality amp to shine as they are power hungry.
B004GYY714|4.0|Not every station but it has quite a few and most importantly to me it has my favorite local Christian station WOLC 102.5 FM so I can carry it everywhere I go as well as a Philadelphia news station 1060 AM that keeps me informed of things going on back at my old home.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Liane Moriarty rarely disappoints with what I would call &#34;smart&#34; chick lit.  Great character development.  Al around, a good solid read.
B009RX8AQW|5.0|Fabulous show. Colin O'Donahue is the hottest actor around! He alone warrants 5 stars! The show, although based on fairy tales, is very rich and layered. I usually shy away from this type of &#34;fantasy&#34;, but the character driven plots are fabulous.
B00F875N98|5.0|This is a great come back album. You will not be disappointed. Great modern rock n' roll music. I would recommend this album.
0399159347|5.0|Best book I've read in years! Once in awhile a book will grab your spirit to the point that you miss the people when the book is over. Notice I didn't call them characters, they became that real. The story was masterful and done differently than other books I've read. If you like books with rich characters, community, mystery, family, relationships and murder, this will be perfect.
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|Fascinating confluence of crime, action, and stage illusion.  Everytime you think you know what's happening you are suddenly thrust in a totally different direction.  Great casting.  Excellent illustions,  Supurb timing.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game app is my favorite and I have it downloaded in mutt cell phone and my Kindle Fire. I highly recommend it.
B00A8LRIEW|3.0|A bit of a mixed bag, basically consisting of outtakes from their final album together 2005's(!) Waiting for the Sirens Call. Most are b-side material, however, there are two tracks that are absolutely necessary; I'll Stay With You and I've Got A Feeling: Both are terrific N/O tracks in a similar vein to their last two albums; Get Ready and 'Sirens. There are also two original mixes that are quite interesting: I Told You So and Hellbent, although, I personally prefer the original of 'Told and vastly prefer the previously released &#34;remix&#34; of Hellbent that appeared on the recent N/O compilation Total. Still, a must for fans and always great to have some &#34;new&#34; material from them!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Fun game to play with my two kids! They laugh and think it's the best on out there by far!
B00DBISUWS|4.0|For a longterm fan, this is a very interesting return (of sorts) to Goldfrapps roots, as Tales of Us bears comparison to their debut Felt Mountain, as well as their 4th album, Seventh Tree: Very cinematic and atmospheric and the spare arrangements bring Alison's vocal to the forefront.  May not please fans of their more electronic masterpieces, Black Cherry, Supernature and Head First, so I'd suggest sampling a few tracks first...Thea and Clay are standouts for me, as they're a little &#34;livelier&#34;, but Drew, Annabel and Alvar are absolutely lush and gorgeous as well.
B00F8802SE|5.0|Love this show ... but when is it going to be available on Instant Video?<br /><br />Such a great show.  Watched the first season and second season on NetFlix<br />just to pass time before I knew about it.  I was so surprised ... it's great.<br />Bought season 3, and looking forward to season 4 ... but when is it.<br /><br />I saw something that said it was going to come out next week, and now I<br />see at Amazon it says January 1st of of next year ... 2014.  I don't want to<br />wait ... does anyone know the real air date for Walking Dead, season 4?
B00F35B8F8|4.0|The new cast of the Star Trek series are great. The best Kirk since the OG.<br /><br />The kids got a little scared in a couple parts but they enjoyed it as well.<br /><br />Go ahead and rent it. Its great.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Just so you know that I read the first of your Pines series. Found out about the 2nd one when I got the e-mail announcing your latest one &#34;Wayward&#34;. I just HAD to get Pt 1. Thanks, your books are amazing. You're definitely one of my Top 5 authors EVER. Keep up the good work & Happy Halloween
B000YABYLA|5.0|excellent movie, quick shipping. Cheap and brand new. I love this movie and show it in my classroom as part of my teen parenting unit. I was glad to be able to get a second copy to have for my class.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Thought this would be more a the regular type of Bingo.<br />Thankfully it was free and I didn't have to purchase this.<br /><br />Thanks
0756655307|5.0|No more telling my son to read a book. This is reading disguised as fun. Now I sometimes have to say, &#34;Will you please put that book down&#34;! Ha ! A mom win. Plus I'm a comic book fan. This is a really fantastic guide to the characters that we all know and love as well as to characters that I never really knew. It is a guide to how so many character came to be an where their powers came from. As a mom as a fan of comic books I say 5 stars isn't enough.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Great characters and acting. Personal asides are believable even if some of the legal cases are a stretch. Good blend of personal, legal and political situations, and likable characters.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Laughed out loud too many times to count. Loved the story And have already pre-ordered the next two!  Read it! You won't be disappointed!
B00BAYLRNO|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Even used I still get a movie that is like brand new.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Normally I hook up my Mac Book Pro to the tv via the HDMI cable. However that means I have to give up googling stuff when the movie gets boring. This however allows for me to enjoy my laptop and watch netflix at the same time. I is a little slow to load at first and for about 30 seconds the shows are very pixilated. This clears up and then its fine. Not hard to set up either. Plug, download, and play.
B00C7JGDBW|4.0|It was a good movie and again great for being used. More for the kids. Very colorful and my grandkids enjoyed it more but it was good.
B00DW36G32|3.0|The first thing i thought after the movie ended was that i really expected more from these 2 actors. It seemed a little cheesy, and didn't seem to have much depth considering the nature of the subject matter. I enjoyed it, but was left feeling like it was a 'B' movie.
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|Yet one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Scared me so it did what it was supposed to do. Again I always buy used and again like new.
B00F91G5BS|4.0|It reminds me of &#34;I am Legend&#34; with Will Smith. I'd say if you liked that movie then you'd probably enjoy this one.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Watched the first and second season, although it has &#34;drama&#34; moments like most shows that aren't necessary I really enjoy this show and am excited to watch season 3
B008JEJVXG|5.0|Wild Nothing’s “Nocturne” is definitely one of the best albums I’ve heard in its genre (dream-pop/indie rock).  Everything is smooth about this record – from the falsetto-like vocals of Jack Tatum to the gorgeous instrumental vibes.  There really is a lot to like here, and Tatum has a lot of ideas that he explores successfully on this record.  The opening track “Shadow” is a song I’ll probably never get tired of even though I’ve heard it about a thousand times.  The way everything comes together on this track is nothing short of magical.  Then, there’s “Only Heather,” which is a beautiful song that uses many layers of sound (and reverb) to create an audio masterpiece.  Some other standout songs are “Nocturne,” “Disappear Always,” “Paradise,” and “Rheya.”  However, every song on here has a dreamy quality that is very appealing.  This is highly recommended, and even though I haven’t bought Wild Nothing’s latest CD yet (shame on me!), this album will stay on heavy rotation for many moons to come.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Many of these games I have found to be either disappointing, frustrating, or both.  This is one of the best I've ever played.  Great length, decent graphics and, best of all for us unskilled, using the hint button only to discover where to go next doesn't count against you when it comes to having to wait for it to recharge!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The Language of Flowers author Vanessa Diffenbaugh weaves a story about a girl named Victoria through childhood into young adulthood. Victoria faces insurmountable challenges of adoption, failed foster family placements, young love and giving birth out of wedlock. I highly recommend this novel!
B007A4SDCG|4.0|A quick read filled with insights into why we don't but must do what we were  born to do. This message came at a great time for me and I will likely read this whenever  I feel like I've gone amateur.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|I haven't read such a great thriller in years!<br />The book kept me in suspense all the way through and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.<br />Never a dull moment, this book is about murder and is filled with suspense, action and adventure.<br />A brilliant plot and a fantastic story.<br />The author is truly talented and I can't wait to read the sequel.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|It's different and fun!! I love it. It challenges you. And my grandkids really loved it. It's the best game ever.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|This is a very well written and entertaining show. Would recommend it! The show is worth the watch I enjoyed it!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I don't like novels in which each of the first few chapters introduces a different group of people and their circumstances. It's obvious that their stories will eventually intersect, but in the meantime, I can't keep either the people or their situations straight. As a result, it's not till the 7th or 8th chapter that I emerge from my State of Muddlement and begin to get with the story.<br /><br />With this book, although I liked the writing a lot, none of the situations in the first several chapters seemed particularly gripping, and I came close to saying forget it. Fortunately, I didn't, because when the story took off, it really took off. As often as I had to put the book aside due to other priorities, I couldn't wait to get back to it. I became mesmerized trying to imagine how I would cope with circumstances that some of the characters faced. How do you deal with your life when you learn a horrible truth about someone close to you? How do you face others knowing what you know?<br /><br />Even weeks after reading the book - a point at which I've forgotten most other novels - some of the characters in this book and the circumstances they faced have stayed with me. That makes Liane Moriarity someone whose other books I'm now eager to read. I'll even try to be patient with opening chapters that introduce different sets of characters.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I really like Kelly Clarkson<br />This CD has everything on it that I like<br />I would recommend this to everyone
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is a great game for people who like logic type games. There's no timer on the levels, so it's relaxing to play.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Loved it! My heart was full. Nice to see points if view from everyone affected by a spinal cord injury.
B00B1E6FF8|2.0|If you'd like to see multiple scenes of torture convincingly depicted on-screen, this is the one to view.<br /><br />If you'd care to know exactly how Bin Laden's compound in Pakistan appeared on the day he was assassinated (right down to intricate designs in ceramic floor-tiles), watch the Blu-ray supplementary material. The production designers recreated the compound, full-scale, in exquisite detail at great expense. But unfortunately, since these few crucial and climactic minutes of the movie were filmed mostly in the dark, you won't be able to enjoy them in the movie per se: less than five per cent of it is visible, I'd estimate, and even that is presented dimly, in sickly green or yellow light. Yes, this may be the way the SEALs experienced it at thirty minutes past midnight. But it's so dark in the film, it's almost ludicrous. It might as well have been filmed at a Holiday Inn somewhere in Nevada for all you're able to see. What a colossal waste of first-class production design.<br /><br />Except for that, it's an excellent movie from the hands of highly talented movie makers.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Very entertaining; visually attractive; good plot and story line. Holds your attention. One that can be watched again and again (as I will) to get what you might have missed. When the details of some illusions are revealed, there are &#34;ah hah&#34; moments. Cast and production fit well together. Good twists and turns.
B000TEUSJK|5.0|what debauchery this movie was something else nothing was held back and all those sex scenes is that how it was back then
B004SKHJF2|5.0|It's pretty accurate, so as long as there is a clear sound that can be sent.  Don't bother trying to sing your song haha.<br /><br />I am not exactly sure what hte difference between shazam and shazam encore is.  This premium app was given free through amazon app store... I dunno what's the difference.  Maybe less advertisements?  I dunno.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Since placing this on my Kindle Fire I find the info invaluable.  I travel across many states and cities daily and can plan my route with complete confidence.  Rate it as a 10 of 10.
B00BHNR1KQ|3.0|Not bad .. not great .. okay.  This was one of the scariest movies that I've ever watched.  I would recommend it.
B001F6TXME|5.0|I can now take pictures with long exposures without touching the shutter release button.  I now take great night shots
031623480X|5.0|This book is written with REAL studies to back the evidence of what wheat/carbs & sugar do to your brain & how to keep your brain healthy.  The wheat eaten today is not the wheat eaten by our grandparents due to GMO; plus all the high fructose corn syrup & how it's damaging to your health.  Highly recommend.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I had a hard time putting this book away until I had read the last page.  Jobs lead a fascinating life.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|This book was discussed at a book club and was found lacking development. and characters dropped. Not his best work.
B000JIHP88|4.0|I love this mobile. My son loves to watch it and listen to the music which helps mommy get things done, and also helps him get back to sleep in the middle of the night. My only complaint is that all the composers are wrong. The Bach button plays Beethoven, the Mozart button plays Bach and the Beethoven plays Mozart.
B0084HJE0S|4.0|Nothing on code or anything that personal, but a great tool for finding out what is coming. I am new to developing and only have one page completed, I haven't explored a lot into more than basic HTML and CSS. Now I know more about what to expect as my Major (Web Development Major) nears in terms of what is new, what is expected, and what to look for. At some point I intend to read again to try to memorize more of the information in the book as it gives a good overview of what to come and strong comparisons to what is used now.<br /><br />The only thing I found bad about this book was that it wasn't longer, I felt it left a bit on the table where it could have expanded on the great information provided. I was sad it ended as soon as it did but the information was worth the money spent.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This app is amazing it gives you an large amount of games to play and it can be very addictive at times. glad it's free and I recommend it to any and everyone.
B00BRUQ3PS|4.0|I've been reading Margaret Atwood for 30 years. Love her writing and would probably read anything she wrote. The MaddAddam Trilogy was a great read. The subject matter was entirely conceivable, though I hope our world never comes to such an end. I eagerly await future Attwood novels.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Doesn't work on Galaxy S1; it keeps crashing the system and blocks the whole phnone for about 5-10 minutes before shutting down and giving me the phone back.
0765337541|5.0|Bought for a college-age granddaughter who wanted to read it before the movie came out.  I have always liked it, and think it is still topical for today's gamers.
B000002H70|5.0|Amazing. What can I say? Let me do my best.<br /><br />I've been playing music semi-professionally for 30+ years and I have only JUST started listening to The Cure. Yes I know, be kind to me. I cannot for the life of me understand how I missed them. I grew up in a musical household, mum a classical pianist, brother a good guitarist (still), many mates playing (still).<br /><br />I heard Just Like Heaven a few months ago (AGAIN how did I miss this?) and was struck. Who is this? Where do I find more? Bought a best of Cure which was great. Wanted more so checked online reviews. \\"Disintegration\\" looked like the best option.<br /><br />Order online - wait.<br /><br />Arrives. Put in slot, read liner notes - \\"This album is mixed to be played loud\\". OK crank it up. Holy crap (you know where this is going right?). First stanza - there go my eardrums. What an album opening - possibly the best I have ever heard.<br /><br />\\"Plainsong\\" bass - unbelievable. \\"Pictures of You\\" - already one of my favorite songs. \\"there was nothing in the world that I ever wanted more/than to feel you deep in my heart\\" - what real human being hasn't thought that at least once? \\"Lovesong\\". \\"Lullaby\\". \\"Fascination Street\\". \\"Same Deep Water\\". \\"Disintegration\\" (try this one when you are feeling up against the world). \\"Homesick\\" (wonderful bass melody).<br /><br />I listened right through and put it on again, and again, and have not stopped. There are 12 tracks and I rate 9 as excellent with 5 as extraordinary.<br /><br />I am absolutely blown away by The Cure, by Robert Smith (and to be honest love Simon Gallup on bass, and Porl and Boris), and by this album Disintegration. Robert Smith is a bit like a male Joni Mitchell - a great, heart-on-sleeve storyteller, and excellent composer.<br /><br />I recently recommended this album to a fullon muso mate of mine (who liked Cure but did not have this). He texted me to say he had it, was three songs in and really liked it. After he played it right through once he said this is an album he will fall in love with.<br /><br />I seriously rate this as one of my top 5 (maybe even 3) albums ever. That is coming from someone who loves any music for its composition, performance and expression; who grew up with classical and the Beatles and Cream and everything else in between. It is not a morose album per se, more an album expressing a range of feelings that had to come out - some up some down. If you are feeling ok Disintegration is great, if you are a bit down it will tug at the heart and you know what that does.<br /><br />This is highly recommended.
1400032717|3.0|It's okay. I mean, I wouldn't have read it if I didn't have to, but it's an okay book. Very easy to read. Definitely from the perspective of a special needs teenager.
B004EF8AJA|5.0|Believable characters and realistic drama make this an enjoyable series.  Highly recommend it to everyone who enjoys movies such as Sense & Sensibility, Pride & Prejudice...
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The core issue in this story is glossed over. 2 or 3 sentences was all you got to tie everything together. More was needed. Again, another Grisham story with a frenetic chase at the end. Too bad. I thought he would have changed his standard mo.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|Okay here is my 3 month review. I have been using this particular mouse for the last 3 months in MOBA, MMORPG, FPS, and ORPGs. Thus far it has been holding up well with the multiple tasks I have to with it at the same time. The precision is pretty accurate when sniping and doing skill shots in various games in addition the feed back feels to be on par with various other gaming mouses I have used in the past. The mouse reacts fast and buttons seem to be well build and have kept up with the high demand these games demand. The delay between pressing and the corresponding action are spot on and I am using the mouse to control not only the game but a VOIP programs to help communicate with teammates with ease and little to no problems.<br /><br />With that being said there are some problems that I have been having with it though. The mouse would randomly start to move on screen even when there is no input being done if set to dpi greater then 4000. The grip they put on the left side surrounding the 3 buttons is hard to clean and is starting to come off. In addition, dirt and other debris then to get in the gap between the mouse and the grip causing it to lift. The other side smooth finish is nice but a textured finish would have made the overall grip better and could have been used as a placement for button number 4 instead of its current location on left side. Another possible location relocation of said button would have been the near the bottom line of the left side to allow for faster accessing of it. The reason I feel this way is the way button 5 is done sort of prevents the easy movement of the thumb to hit and activate the button during a fast team fight in LOL or as a reload function in Black Ops 2. It is because of this awkward feel for me that I basically have ignored that button completely and have it currently disabled.<br /><br />The ability to change the weights to allow the mouse to be either heavier or lighter is a nice touch but they are a little difficult to put in and out and could benefit from either having the individual weight engraved or a sticker indicating the its weight on the back so you can put in the amount you like in. I prefer it having 5 of the included 8 weights in but I do not know how much that is adding to mouses overall weight. It is really just an opinion on how much I want to customize the mouse and an easier way of saying how much weight I like adding overall in general when you switch mice.<br /><br />Lastly the profile switching button is nice idea but its location is less then ideal if you are trying to switch during game so I basically have it set for different game styles. One for fps and another for MOBA's currently. While the macro feature is nice I have since disable it completely and use the former buttons as dpi up down buttons for they feel better like that then anything else for me.
B000ME5B30|4.0|It was very easy to set up the movie (for an assignment) for viewing. The directions were very clear and I was able to view it again and again before my time expired.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|well worth the money, we had to catch up before the new season started up and was not disappointed, always keeps you wanting more
B0074PNCRM|5.0|Sometimes an author just gets it right! That's what John Green has done here. What a wonderful story.<br /><br />Enough has already been said about the book so I won't re-cap all that. I'll just say that I loved it, it touched me and I won't forget it soon.
1936608898|5.0|I have read so many books on nutrition and healthy lifestyles. This book is AMAZING! It is not just someones' opinion of how we should eat, it's the SCIENCE behind what we should eat! It has been 3 months, I have lost 18 pounds. I have more energy than I've had in years! (I'm 47) But most importantly, I DO NOT have cravings anymore for sugar! I am NOT hungry!!! I am fully satisfied with each meal and snacks. No more self deprecating thoughts of failing a diet! I am SO encouraged and want everyone to know about this lifestyle of eating. A great cookbook to go along with this book is &#34;Everyday Paleo&#34; by Sarah Fragoso.  Thank you SOOOO much Hartwigs for writing this book!!!!!
B00BFV1JVM|5.0|I loved this book. I think it was one of the first YA dystopian books I ever read and since reading it I've lost count of how many more dystopian books I've read and enjoyed. I doubt there are many people left who don't know what the book is about so I won't recap. If you are one of the few, please read the synopsis.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins is a wonderful writer. I thoroughly enjoyed her character development and the world she created became very real to me. The subject matter was fascinating and I was very happy there were two more books in the series.<br /><br />I watched the movie after reading the books and it wasn't too bad. However, if you haven't seen the movie yet, I would recommend reading the books first. As is usually the case, you just lose so much content in the movie.
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|I love Demi Lovato as a vocalist. She can do some amazing things with her voice and I'm an unashamed bubblegum pop lover, so though I didn't love this as much as her past albums, it's pretty similar to \\"Unbroken\\" in sound. Lots of electronic pop songs and some good ballads. My favorite tracks are \\"Heart Attack\\", \\"Nightingale\\", and \\"Never Been Hurt\\" and \\"Made in the USA\\". \\"Warrior\\" seems to be the \\"Skyscraper\\" of the album. Definitely empowering, inspiring songs of girl power. I admire her strength and I hope she can stay sober so her talent can continue to shine and inspire young women.

B00F7YHDWC|4.0|A pretty fun game. Challenging and fast paced, your goal is to save these retarded little things from their untimely demise. Gets boring after a while.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game so addictive I can play it for hours and not get bored this game is a 10star :D
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I personally own the ds version of this game, and I have to say, it's one of my favorites. The only problem is that you only get 50 levels for your money, and then have to buy the &quot;world pass&quot;. All in all, a great game.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Great game, I love it.the counting of blocks to figure out how to get the picture is very relaxing, I can spend hours working on this.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is probably my favorite game on my kindle. I would give it ten stars if it were possible. A great, amazingly fun game if you like endless. I highly recommend.

B004742Y68|3.0|The actors and actresses did not act very well in expresing dreadfulness when encountering poltergeist.  The movie did have a plot, but it looked unrealistic to be scary.

B000LPR9ZS|2.0|By 2006 the now-passe torture porn sub-genre was in full swing. The producers of Saw were enjoying the profits made from cheaply and easily grossing-out morbid audiences with icky gore and people screaming. It's not clever, and it's not even remotely classy.<br /><br />Clocking in at just under two hours, this is the longest of the Saw series, but the constant flashbacks that bloat that running time are already becoming very tiresome and gives the movie the feel of a TV show. Chopping the heavy plot into vignettes is not very theatrical or interesting.<br /><br />With Jigsaw still at large and Donnie Wahlberg's angry cop now missing the cops begin to suspect that Jiggy has an accomplice. This is all forgotten about by the five-minute mark as the movie then sidetracks into a story about a man who has lost his son in a car accident and wishes for retribution. Jiggy arranges for the retribution to happen, but advises him to save the people responsible from gruesome death instead of letting them die.<br /><br />Jiggy's judgement and justification is already becoming dubious and morally suspect by this point. I half expect him to start kidnapping and setting-up people for watching too much Nickelodeon or flying too many kites. The morality should go both ways. If Jiggy is subjecting so many people to unbearable agony then he should have experience and knowledge of much, much more than simply dying of cancer and surviving a car crash. Who does he think he is? Ultimately, he's just as bad as the people he is judging.<br /><br />The story is worthy of a higher score, but as usual it is bogged down by horrendous editing, cheap photography filled with fake filters, a loud sound design filled with nonsensical effects, and characters who do not think logically.<br /><br />It reminded me a lot of Hellraiser, only with none of the magic. Unfortunately, for anyone watching the whole series, it's vital that you digest every minute, overwrought plot point.<br /><br />The Blu-ray present the film in 1.78:1 1080p that exhibits all of the fake color filters in their unappealing glory with a rather old-fashioned DTS ES 5.1 soundtrack. A reasonable amount of extras are included.sent the film in 1.78:1 1080p that exhibits all of the fake color filters in their unappealing glory with a rather old-fashioned DTS ES 5.1 soundtrack.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|This is a great album that revisits some of the best Beatles songs and makes them come alive again in a very well produced and engineered presentation. Be sure you hear it on a big sound system and enjoy the quality of the craftsmanship that will make you smile.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|Loved the interactions between the characters. It's a great romance between Todd and Megan. Two people who both need to heal.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|I will make sure I spread the word for people to read this book. I have actually started doing so. This book have me such a clear understanding of my self. He encouraged and help set me free. Thank you so much! My life will never be viewed the same!

B00H83EV5W|3.0|Gravity is a beautiful but limited film starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. They play a medical engineer and an astronaut who struggle to survive an accident that leaves them stranded in space. Both are doing a space walk when an emergency situation involving Russia &#34;accidentally&#34; shutting down one of its own satellites occurs and they must dodge debris and return to their ship to survive. The performance of Clooney is solid as usual but Bullock is forgettable. It is hard for Bullock's charm to shine through in her spacesuit. While the visuals are impressive there isn't much in the way of dialogue or story. Although it is billed as a thriller this is more of a drama and remains predictable, hollow and slightly dull. If you are most interested in the special effects then you may appreciate this movie.<br /><br />IMDB rated this an astounding 8.8 upon initial release which is the same as The Empire Strikes Back. Don't believe the hype because it isn't even in the Top 10 for space odysseys. My date said she felt dizzy after 20 minutes but didn't mind because she loved the film (to each their own). Gravity seems like a blend of many superior films in space with little of the soul due to its minimalist approach. I must admit I enjoyed Apollo 13 and Solaris more (which also starred Clooney). Despite the flaws it did manage to hold my interest better than After Earth. You do get a Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray 2D, DVD, and an UltraViolet digital copy in the 3-disc combo pack.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|Love this app. So far no glitches and there seems to be lots to check out. I would definitely recommend this to friends.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|Will be rereading again. I feel like I've walked down an isle in the grocery store and found the sardines. Why sardines and what else is in that isle?
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I have followed the TED conferences online for years.  I was thrilled to learn that there is an 'app' for this.  The app is very easy to use and I love reading/seeing all the interesting presentations from their conferences.<br /><br />TED is awesome!

1490313370|5.0|Choose Yourself is a roller-coaster conversation with a brilliant mind. James is a well lubricated, turbo-charged idea machine. A bright beacon of honesty in the baloney kingdom we currently endure. Thanks James, your light just made mine brighter!
B002UBRFDC|5.0|The made for TV series Shogun was my first real exposure to Japanese anything and I never forgot. It was an amazing show, the Game of Thrones of its time. Years later I read this book, so, so much better than even my memories of the TV series. Then at last, on DVD, and then at last this ebook.... I am nearly 40, and this is still James Clavell's masterpiece. Honto.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|This movie is so much better than it seems a comic book inspired flick has a right to be. Can't say enough good things about it.
B004LM72ZY|5.0|This is a fun, well-built toy that is easy for toddlers to use while still being fun for older kids.

B00EQF0JJC|5.0|A fun play done by a terrific cast.  It was a great time seeing so many favorite actors from various Joss Whedon projects together doing something entirely different.<br /><br />I hope they decide to do more of these types of things together.
B005PK553C|4.0|Not for the faint-hearted. Tortuously complex story line--but hang in there, it is worth it. Phenomenal actors. The house itself is a gorgeous plus.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|Excellent writing, dialogue and plat twists. Uneven towards the end where it looked like he was finishing up the book, and decided to put in some good stuff he forgot. He is a great writer and can jump-start a story real well, creating momentum as he goes.

0425252868|4.0|Wish this came in a larger typeface.  I had to put it down once in a while due to difficulty reading even with my reading glasses but, I have to say the book was GREAT!  Eye opening
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I missed this show when it aired originally so I watched all four seasons on Amazon Prime.  Now I know why everyone has been raving about it.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|I watched this movie and after I was done went WOW what a waste of time. The worse movie he has done yet. So predictable and was just bad. If you can rent it for free go for it.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This was an outstanding read.  Really enjoyed all of the 80's references to video games, music, computers, D&D, etc.  Found out after the fact that Ernest Cline also wrote the movie Fanboys (highly recommended!!!).  Highly recommend this book for anyone who grew up in the 80's...kick-ass story and plenty of nostalgia to boot!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It helps me find the words I'm looking for when I need too<br /><br />I love this book cause it's useful for finding out how to spell  the word you are looking for and the definition to that word.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Anyone who likes a rough and tumble show will enjoy BB.  Not for the person who doesn't like violence in their programming. the writers are amazing to be able to write such complex characters.
B00EVCD9HY|5.0|Janelle Monae is an absolute genius. Yes she is like marmite - you either love her or you don't - there is no middle ground with her. I personally love her. You either get her creative and musical genius or you don't - simple!<br /><br />The best tracks are:<br /><br />1) Dorothy Dandridge Eyes (Michael Jackson influenced)<br />2) Ghetto Woman (Stevie Wonder influenced)<br />3) It's Code (Jackson 5 influenced)<br />4) Electric Lady<br />5) Victory (Lauryn Hill/Fugees influenced)<br />6) Q.U.E.E.N.<br />7) Can't Live Without Your Love<br />8) Look Into My Eyes<br />9) The Overtures<br />10) PrimeTime<br /><br />The worst tracks are:<br /><br />1) Dance Apocalyptic (I could truly live without this - its way to poppy for me and I am not really into pop music)<br />2) Sally Ride<br />3) We Were Rock n Roll (whoever said this song reminds them of Michael Jackson's \\"Remember The Time\\" clearly don't remember the time! Because it sounds nothing like \\"Remember The Time\\")<br />4) Give Em What They Love (I've never been a huge fan of Prince and his rock vibe - I prefer his funk vibe - this track is a bit too rocky for my liking and feels out of place on an otherwise funky, dancy and smooth album)<br />5) The Interludes (all are totally pointless)<br /><br />Vocally, I don't think she is the greatest but she does have the vocal versatility and capacity to sing on a variety of different musical styles - ranging from R&B/Funk/Soul/Jazz/Dance! Musically and lyrically she is sensational. She puts her own unique stamp on records that have that oh so familiar sound. I mean we have all heard and adored Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder but she blends their styles into her own and gives it that futuristic feel of a masterpiece! I loved The ArchAndroid but I think 10 out of the 19 tracks on Electric Lady are better and could have made a stunning album all on their own!
B001RTSPVY|5.0|The characters were wonderfully written. The psychological trick used be Walt were amazing to watch.  Showed that he was brilliant, but could (would) manipulate anyone with no regard at all for the consequences to them. Jesse was favorite character by far.
B002VPE1WK|2.0|Top handle for the bag broke already; haven't made three weeks old yet-really!!!! Not good quality- very disappointment - don't buy!
B009VIZDLI|5.0|The Rosie Project is a great quick read. It is hard to review without giving away some of the surprises and my best description would that it is a kind-of love story that explores the autism spectum. I giggled most of the way through and would recommend it to all readers looking for something lighthearted yet thought provoking. I'm usually pedantic about grammar and punctuation; however, I didn't make any notations as I read this story - either because I was so engaged I missed the errors or because there weren't any worth noting.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|I love this movie, even tho there are a lot of screen flares its still fun to watch lol. Check it out, if you have not seen it. If you are into these types of movies i am sure you'll enjoy it.
B00COCY67A|5.0|I enjoyed this CD because it has Elvis in rehearsal which tells of his relationship with his band and backing vocalist. We get an insight on the Man himself, his sense of fun and we hear him laughing!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Sorry to see the series end. I enjoyed the books very much. I'll try to get my daughter to a &#34;Hunger Games&#34; marathon coming up in November of 2013.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really enjoyed this game.  Can't wait for more levels.  A tutorial in the beginning would be nice because on the very first level is not obvious what to do.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|Reviews are really good, this is a good movie but not great. Not the type of movie you would watch again and again over the years. Rental is the way to go. Average is about the best I can rate it
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Addictive burned through it in 4 days couldn't put it down<br />I highly recommend this book and hope that it entertains the next reader as much as it did me!
B001O37WTY|4.0|Interesting but also confusing. How can a group of people have individuality sharing the same personality (the &#34;vessel&#34; presumably exhibits one distinct personality to the outside world whilst being shared internally by many differenmt personalities?)... Yeah I don't know- it's been a few weeks since I watched it. I don't know. A good film for thinkers- not so much for those only into silly comedies and/or action stuff.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|It brings out the kid in all men t by at wanted to run there own park. Easy to get started and really the reminders to collect stop from all the endless checking.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|So the basic reaction to this is either: not that good at all, man... stupid - or: silly and over-the-top but that's what fans of this franchise want it's very good for Die Hard fans... but I disagree. It's not a bad film it's just not much there. Not much of what I expect and like as a Die Hard fan. Easily my least favorite of the series so far. However, if you're a fan then this won't really disappoint... or disappoint too much. There's some good bits. Not great. Okay.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I read all the time so I love it, I have it on my phone and Tablet. Now we just need the movies to stream on android from my prime account.
B000YABS8E|5.0|Not too serious not too silly... smart enough and funny enough- a real classic as far as I'm concerned. Word.

B0031TZ8TU|5.0|I knew the results of the mission headed by Ross Perot, but reading the account of the way the mission was developed and carried out was fascinating.  There were many roadblocks along the way, but they never gave up.  Great read!
B004SIP9VA|5.0|I have loved this movie since it first came out. I rated this ages ago so this will be short, as the purchase was to replace in my collection, the VHS tape with the DVD. (That should tell you a lot right there!) This is Jennifer Lopez at her best IMO, acting instead of strutting her &#34;stuff&#34; (be it all great) on stage. I have never seen a movie with Susan Sarandon in it that I didn't love, especially her performance. She is an outstanding actress that never seems to get her just due. Richard Gere is just added eye-candy. In all seriousness though, yes, this is a romantic comedy, chick-flick, but done very well and a delight to watch........over and over again. My collection would not be without it.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|This game is fun and habit forming<br />I am steal try to learn how to  play some of the levels but I like the challenge .
B003ASLJK4|5.0|I have loved this movie since it first came out. I rated this ages ago so this will be short, as the purchase was to replace in my collection, the VHS tape with the DVD. (That should tell you a lot right there!) This is Merle Streep at her best IMO, although she has the Midas Touch with ever roll she plays. Every time I watch it I lose myself with her character and really do forget I am watching Merle. She is an outstanding in this movie. What's not to say about Clint Eastwood? Loved him in &#34;Play Misty for Me&#34;, through the gamut of Westerns, all the Dirty Harry's, and everything else. Love him as a director, and even as a politician, but IMO you haven't fallen in love with him until you have seen him in &#34;Bridges&#34;. Yes this is a chick-flick, and it is romantic, but it is far from a comedy. It has everything. If there is a remote possibility that there is someone, somewhere, that has not seen this yet, do it now....that's what I'm going to do right now.....again!

B009XIXVU6|4.0|Liked this story of different smaller stories with a connecting thread. Didn't like it as well as Thousand Splendid Suns but it was a page turner nonetheless.
1451626096|5.0|I bought the book for an anniversary present for my wife and it did not disappoint. My wife has all the Philippa Gregory books and has re-read the stories over and over again.
B00578FKVE|4.0|This is a very entertaining season. Some of the attempts to mirror the original movies seem strange but overall I liked it. Watching the second season now.... I can see why it got killed in the 2nd season. They must have changed the writers in season 2.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|I really like the visual effects used in this movie.  The story was just OK and at least there was a little twist at the end, which I give some credits to.
B0035G5IOE|5.0|this movie's pretty neat. the music, voice acting and animation come together quite nicely for a rather charming and unforgettable film.
B008Y6MKSW|5.0|This film is a classic!  It's as funny today as it was when it first came out - the comedic timing, writing and directing are perfect!
B00DIMXTBO|5.0|I read Outview, and followed it with Outin almost immediately. While I loved Outview for it's message, Outin swept me fully into the action, deepening the bonds and emotional ties between the characters, inviting the reader to become fully invested, and revealing potential fissures and dangers looming in the future for Nate and his friends, as well as the Inner Movement, itself. I can't wait for the next book in the series.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|I read this book last in the series of the Sword of Truth books, and I believe the book was better because of that initially inconvenient problem. I truly enjoy Mr. Goodkinds writing style and his use of language, these books are a pleasure to read. I would recommend the books to any one who believes that truth and justice should always prevail.
B00DJ4PIBK|5.0|My daughter love this advent calendar, much better than having a piece of candy for my child everyday in December.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|If you are into putting you chrome browser on the TV them go for it. That is the only good thing you can do with it. What's missing is screen casting or also called multi screen. From you android device this is complete and utterly useless. The best you could do is share you YouTube video with TV. If you are use to dlna or airplay streaming then this device is like going back 60 years. Google why can't you have your fetchers work together.
B00C27LB20|5.0|Great lyrics, melody and a unique voice.  Good old rock and roll that will make you get up out of your seat; beautiful lyrics and melodies that will bring a tear to your eye. He's so young - can't wait for more music from him.
0061124958|5.0|I am so glad I found this classic to read to my class.  It is a tender picture of friendship between unlikely characters.  It caused my students to become sympathetic to two unwanted species:  pigs and spiders.  They see both through a different light.
B00BYKIKJS|4.0|This movie made me laugh and was sweet enough to make me get teary eyed. And I need 5 more words to finish my review.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|Great old school Sci-fi movie. I can see many of today's movies take concepts from this classic. Great packaging also.
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie it was very entertaining. The story had mystery and it was asteticly pleasing to watch with all of the special effects.
1781162646|5.0|I love Stephen King's books. This one was even better than I expected. Not only was it creepy and suspenseful, it was a wonderful tale of growing up.
1476751935|5.0|I love the daily quotes that inspire me for that day and I can always read it again.  This is a good read for all ages.
1476727651|5.0|King once again captures your imagination and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Danny Torrence is a deeply flawed character; He is quite realistic with the exception of the shining of course. I enjoyed every word!
1878424319|5.0|With this book you have to take a good look at yourself so you can begin to change your core thinking.  Once you balance your core thinking about yourself then everything will bounce off of that.
B002AOWXQ8|5.0|It makes me happy enough to dance & sing all by myself.Concert came here (b'ham) but it was sold out months b4.Sure hope they come back. :-D
B002ZG9940|4.0|This is a great movie.  It's not as &#34;actiony&#34; as you might think from the cover, or even the trailer, but the action that is in it is well done and very effective.  This is an excellent example of George Clooney in serious mode.  Personally, I very much enjoy the quite, meticulousness, of this movie and the main character.  There is a bit of &#34;ghosting&#34; on this disc in a couple of scenes, but the movie itself is so beautifully shot in such beautiful locations that it doesn't really matter.  Definitely worth the watch.
B008M7BQHE|5.0|Great show, great entertainment.  Sometimes hard to follow, but worth the watch if you have the time. Best watched like a movie, not a weekly series.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love Bingo Blitz. I play it all day long. Like trying to complete each city to get the frame.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love it!<br /><br />Well done show.  Very enjoyable series.  The scenery and costumes are amazing also.  Can''t wait for the next season.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Great information  will change the way you look at food. This opens your eyes as to the really world of meat a meat products. Scary stuff.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Slow start but great book. I didn't know much about Jobs but I really enjoyed reading this book. Highly recommended
B00EB6F1TY|4.0|Was pretty exciting.  Lots of action.  Not enough of Iron Man in the suit, but lots of IRON MAN SUITS.  In the end it was worth the watch.
B0041YI4ZO|5.0|This dvd is awesome! I love this dvd. It works perfectly. There isn't really anything I dislike about the dvd. It does exactly what it is supposed to do. I would recommend this product to anyone
B00FAEPX9Y|4.0|One knocked off for originality, some of these songs sound just like Lana Del Ray.<br />Which got me thinking...does Lorde go the way of Lana or Norah?<br /><br />I hope she's sustainable like Norah, not a one hit wonder like Lana.<br />Enough off track, this is a good album and a lot of fun to listen to.
B004I1AGTC|5.0|This dvd combo is awesome! I love how it is two in one. It works perfectly. There isn't really anything I dislike about the dvd. It does exactly what it is supposed to do. I would recommend this product to anyone
B000J6I0VG|5.0|My kids and I love this movie. We watch at least once a month. I wish there were a sequel.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Sometimes i have missed an episode... Love being able to catch up with all the trials and tribulations of this cast
B004ULEEY8|5.0|Great movie. Great effects. Don't listen to the negative comments. This was great Sci-Fi. Extras were ok but since I don't watch them they didn't matter. Lol
B005FVFWOI|5.0|I had not listened to to this album in at least 15 years.  Yeah, I know it's a classic but (especially) the cd releases just weren't worth listening to for me.  I hesitated with this release, too, all the comments about how great it sounds, blah, blah,blah...  Well, they were right.  I've heard things on this cd that I've never heard before, and I bought this album new when it was first released over 40 years ago!  Steven Wilson has done an incredible job with this set, was absolutely worth the money.  Can't even count how many times I've listened to this since I bought it...
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I am almost speechless by the deeply moving story that has been given to us. As magnificent and at the same time, horrible, I did not want the story to end. I can only imagine the emotions the writer endured with the birth of this book.  I can only offer my deep expression of gratitude.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The Fault in our Stars is a wonderful book, write makes it easily captivating. This book is a definite must read.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|This is my one favorite tv show ever. It  was very affordable and recorded well. I bought two and gave one as a gift. Thanks
B00466HM28|3.0|didn't like the way keys respond. very small keys and unprofessional. I suppose it might feel  some very basic needs such as entering notes into the computer or perhaps if you want to use it as drum kit (which wasn't my intention). but it's very difficult to play music on it.
0143122010|2.0|The book lacked many citations and the most current (even for the publication date) understanding of the topics that he was writing about. You can quickly tell that he is not a specialist on violence AND that he is not a social scientist. I was very disappointed in the book.
0143124544|5.0|Me Before You is the best book I have read in a long time.  It is the kind of book that I can't get out of my mind.  The characters are real.  The book made me think about a topic in a way I never had before.  Think of this, how people can say that a person who had been terminally ill and had suffered and was in pain dies and is now free from suffering and pain, don't we now say that person is free of pain and is in peace and this gives us relief to know there is no more suffering.  This what I came to think about with Be Before You.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I like the characters very much, but, like most mysteries, I forget them easily. The hard work of trying to surprise a reader within a very strict genre becomes too easy to spot.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great writing.  After reading the first two I couldn't wait to see the two teams get together.  I like that he gave the teams some adversity but didn't create drama, just for drama's sake.  Looking forward to the fourth book.
B00ACKU1NY|3.0|I uninstalled it because my antivirus program kept flagging it as a threat to my device: it is deemed intrusive.  It was very good in the beginning, but then the channels began to disappear.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a game fun for all! Its absolutely addicting! Once you play once you will want to keep playing!
B0012QVJXS|1.0|This was so lame! How did I ever watch this when I was a kid? I watched some of it before I stopped it and actually wanted those minutes of my life refunded back to me.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I like this cover so much that I have them on both of our kindle fires. They are light and cover the face of the kindle fully. I also like the way I can  prop it up when I am eating my lunch , it leaves my hands free to I can read and enjoy my lunch at the same time.
B0070UFMOW|3.0|I have an ipod touch 4 gen, the sound on ipod is clearer and more natural than Alpen E17 i tested the sound with bose head phones, and Bose Speakers, i think on the ipod sounds a little better.<br /><br />the battery is not charging...
B00F91H666|1.0|What a terrible movie. Not even Brad Pitt can turn this sows ear into a silk purse. For a decent sci fi flick check out Cowboys an Aliens.
B00FEHXISA|2.0|I am a huge fan of the Ironman and Avengers franchise, however this movie fell very short compared to the previous movies.  This was a movie looking for a great story and never really finding it.  The writers put together a mindless storyline that was difficult to follow and then trying to fill the gaps with slapstick humor that didn't just didn't fit anywhere.  You can't go wrong with Downey and Paltrow, but they were seriously let down by the script.  In the end this was a mindless action movie that never finds a real plot other than action for its own sake.  I would not be interested in watching this film a second time.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love playing this app. It keeps me busy and it fun. I would encourage you to get it. It makes my day good.
B000002HNR|5.0|a for fun and Doors' lovers Cd. If you have loved this band, you have to have this live cd
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|He writes the best books. This book was similar to the shining. I love the characters. Stephen King you pulled it off again
B00843TZJ2|5.0|these old men are still great musicians..nothng new but really great music. Mr Stills' voice a little down but a muscal leon..super CD and DVD..if you love CSN you must have it !
B003TH41H4|1.0|I'm an Audible.com addict and listened to \\"The Wizard's First Rule\\" from which \\"Legend of the Seeker\\" was adapted.  It is now obvious to me that listening to books by a narrator with the proper accents and acting technique is the best way to adapt a book.  \\"The Legend of the Seeker\\" was horrible after listening to the book.  I stopped after half the video because I didn't want my memory tarnished by this Americanized, beefcake version of a great story.  A good narrator/actor of a book can stimulate the imagination enough to make watching a video version either a chore or somewhat entertaining.  Three cheers for Audible.com for offering sound that enhances (most of the time) an author's work.
B00ECLU346|5.0|I love the whole Hangover series.  This was icing on the cake and took me by surprise.  The ending was great and Allan is still crazy and full of surprises.  Mr. Cow makes a huge come back in this film and the turns and twists are crazy.  You will not regret renting or purchasing this film.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Very well written. I can't wait for the next book. Will look into reading other books by Patrick Rothfuss.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|&#34;It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting.&#34;<br /><br />This is the story of the young shepherd Santiago, who is more importantly a dreamer. Santiago dreams of travel and of treasure, and instead of waiting around for what he wants he goes after it. I don't know that &#34;profound&#34; is the word I'd use to describe this book, but I think the message is important. People have dreams, and sacrifice their dreams for obligations deemed more important, and then one day they wake up miserable and wonder what if? What if I'd done what I wanted, what if I'd done what makes me happy? You might be a fool for following your dreams, instead of picking the responsible or respectable course, but at least you might be a happy fool.<br /><br />Another recurring theme, is following the omens and listening to the universe when it tries to speak/help. I'm not sure how much I believe in a divine pre-written future, where omens guide you on your way. But if you've ever had something unusual happen, something small and unexplained that altered your path or confirmed a decision...Well, its certainly something to think about.<br /><br />I don't know how helpful this story would be for most adults. People who have faith in their obligations instead of having faith in faith. But I think kids should read this. I think with the growing pressures of school systems, it wouldn't hurt for children/teens to remember to set aside some time to dream.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Bought it as one of our kindles would not charge thought it was the cable but still would not charge so decided it was the connection in the kindle so use the new cable with other kindles
B0034JV5YO|5.0|I bought this CD thinking of my father.<br />He was surprised because he still did not know Galliano.<br />He loved the CD and asked me: where did you get this precious CD?<br />He is 89 years old. I am happy I could give him some music that he enjoyed a lot.
B00D2ZF3GQ|3.0|this review is on the blu ray disc of the movie, as follows -<br />movie - 3.5 / 5<br />video - 4 / 5<br />audio - 4 / 5<br /><br />not one of will smith's better movies,  average video and audio on this<br />blu. a rental at best. could have been better, but pacing rests<br />with the director - m. night , whose movies of lately hasn't been top<br />quality.<br />still good to watch once...
B00B52F278|5.0|I don't think I ever loved any series as much as Spartacus.  It's not the typical kind of action and drama that normally would attract me but I was HOOKED!  Hot bodies, beautiful men and women, the scenery and costume was incredible.  The dialog was beautiful, vulgar and brutal.  The music overture was outstanding (so much so that I bought it).  Every night a new episode came on I watched it over again because it aired again on STARZ.  Talk about sitting on the edge of your chair, screaming or cheering at the TV, having a full hour go by in an instant, and then having to wait a week to see the next episode was a killer.  I enjoyed this theatrical version so much that it inspired me to read a book on the history of the Spartacus wars. This is one of the most well produced series EVER!  If you are a woman you will become a fan of some of the hottest men on screen.  If you are a man you will become a fan of some of the most beautiful women on screen.  I have each season and I'm not the kind of person to run out and buy DVD's.  I don't easily get sucked into TV period.  I'd give it 10 stars if I could!
B00C7607BC|5.0|this review is on the blu ray disc of the movie, as follows -<br />movie - 5 / 5<br />video - 5 / 5<br />audio - 5 / 5<br /><br />great re-master, super video and audio from the disney studios, it's like<br />watching the movie again for the very first time.<br />highly recommended for your collection .
B00BW6SOIQ|4.0|It's not an accadomy winner but it's a good flick for the content. Love James Spader. Kinky for sure and a bit humorous although I don't know if it was intended to be.
B008JFUOVI|4.0|this review is on the blu ray disc of the movie, as follows -<br />movie - 3.5 / 5<br />video - 4.5 / 5<br />audio - 4.5 / 5<br /><br />great video and audio on this blu ray movie of yet another of the hangover movies.<br />though it was not a great movie, it was still watchable.<br />storyline was a bit weak throughout with a few laughs here and there.<br />a rental at best.
B009PMEEY2|2.0|Great game but keeps closing any music i have playing in the background and keeps closing on me. Would rate it higher if it stoped doing it.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|A classic drama about overcoming extreme adversity played by superior actors. A story that is worth repeating and never seems to go stale.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Great graphics and character presentations. The zombies were what made the movie! The characters were very disgusting sounding and looking. Must see!
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|The service was great and the movie was in good quality, but the movie was very boring. So this rating is not for the seller, but for the movie itself.
B002RT2BXQ|4.0|Very well acted  and directed and filmed, the insistence on cutting corners and compromising the artistry of Frank LLoyd Wright by the producers of this film is in direct opposition to the philosophy of Ayn Rand. Outside of the mediocre architecture depicted ,it's a reasonable presentation of the novel.
B005D6O124|3.0|I am somewhat disappointed that this shoe seems to run small.  Wish I'd known before I ordered it.  The price was good and I received it in the promised time.  My daughter is enjoying the shoes, her feet are smaller that mine.
B008BM9L72|2.0|This book is about the most annoying girl, I've ever read about. She constantly thinks the same thoughts, makes the same mistakes, spirals down her orgasm the same way, and frankly it's boring to read about. The author tries to throw in a few events to make surprising, but they're all very easy to predict and are quickly solved by her having sex.<br /><br />I don't like it because it is repetitive, and by the 3rd book the erotic reading has become so repetitive that it gets boring.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend it.
B00821OX98|5.0|Great story, characters and production values.  The story is not predictable and has a lot of surprises. Cool aliens with their own issues. Enjoyed the series very much.
B0089XH38M|5.0|I have used avg for all  of my antivirus on all my devices. Easy and simple to use. Basic but gets the job done
B009LDD1X0|4.0|Season 6 of BBT was not a surprise,  It was great, though, and an excellent addition to our collection.  The price guarantee was nice as well.  It kicked in twice and saved us 7 additional dollars.
B00ECLU346|3.0|Same old routine different story, Thank god for Galifanakis or this movie would have gotten one star even he got to be irritating.
B0091THRCU|4.0|I love this pouch: it fits snuggly in my pocket while protecting my iphone 5 nicely. It also fits into my heavy duty belt holster, combining to make a very secure place to carry while cycling. I also love that it is not real leather: I searched forever to find a product that didn't use animal parts and there are very few of them (shame). This is well made and tough and I use it all the time, every day (2 months now). When I first got it, it fit very snugly as advertised and pretty much required you to pull on the tab to have the phone pop out, but after a few weeks of constant use, it freed up and now the phone slides out if you shake it down or invert it and squeeze the outside seams, it will slide out (hopefully into your hand below). I have had a couple of frights where I accidentally picked it up with the opening down and the phone almost slid out and crashed to the ground, so you have to be careful not to do that... I eventually cut the tab off completely so it lays flat on either side as I had stopped using the tab anyway.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I watch a lot of shows and this is one of the best!! Can't wait for the next season of this show!!
B00C8EQ5SW|5.0|SOA season four doesn't skip and plays all epidsodes fully! This was definitely worth my money! (: super happy with this product!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Keeps my memory freed up automatically.  It has really helped me to make my kindle better and more useful, would recommend.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|This book was even better than the first one.  I finished it in 3 days, would have been sooner if I didn't have to work.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|Another enjoyable Harry Bosch story that keeps a hold on you through out.  I have liked everything I have read from Michael Connolly, and this one is no exception.  Well done, can't wait for the next one.  Arthur Decker, Bristol, CT
1416955070|3.0|perfect condition, however the book wasn't that great, another one of those teenaged fantasy stories that aren't written all that well.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It is a fun brain teaser when you need to unwind, relax and think about nothing. That's all I have to say.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|Great game for Adults and children alike.  REALLY enjoyed this app. The game play is simple but the levels get progressively harder as you would expect.  Great time killer!
B00F35B8F8|5.0|JJ Abrams does it again in Star Trek into Darkness.  He is able to take all the things you love from the original series and bring a modern twist to it.  Well done all around.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|Different then the old birds of course, Nice change up, comes in handy when waiting for appts. Thank you so much

B00C7JGDBW|5.0|love this move when i said in the theater.. order it as to i in joy at home .. thank you
006178480X|2.0|This is my first (and last) Rollins novel.  I should have stopped after the photo from the future was taken by a satellite designed for another mission but re-purposed in short order for this new mission.  Photo from the future?  And better yet, none of the scientists, generals, or anyone for that matter seems to question it.  Well, that is in part because some priest receives a package that, guess what, indicates the word is going to end, and the photo was of the same thing?  Add to it the beautiful secret agent who is related to the most powerful women drug lord, a guy who has tiny magnets surgically implanted in his fingers, another secret agent who has a bionic hand - well, you get the idea.  As long as you can accept these as plausible, then maybe you can get through the book.  I could not.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Good looking and easy on the brain, eyes and battery.  The extra feautres above alarm clock are very handy!Thank you.  Highly recommended.
B002APU580|4.0|The parts are greater than the whole with this film. Heaps of fun, a young tone as if Miss Marianne Dashwood had read the novel and dreamt over it. I appreciated the late 18th century setting, and the rustic genteel poverty of the Bennett family. Putting Mr Bennett and Eliza under a sharper light, and Darcy under a softer one was also appreciated. Everyone else were treated like people, and not caricatures. M McFayden's every movement and gesture, every flinch and flicker across his face tells us about Darcy's striving rationality, and its shift towards Elizabeth's person. K Knightly's radiance plays Eliza Bennett's nascent rationality; womanly and in danger of being deformed by her father's sardonic view of life and people, and stunted by her mother's limited views, with the air of an over ripe snarky middle schooler who is brought to adulthood by real love. The rest of the cast is superb, and supports the couple's story wonderfully. The scrambled, and sometime garbled text is annoying, and Knightly's tendency towards model face can be distracting. Very enjoyable dancing and dining scenes as per Austen. Pax,jb.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game is so addicting - I can't put it down.  I started with the &#34;easy&#34; level and am working my way up.
B003PPDBQ2|5.0|Could not put this down - pulls on the heart strings all the way through but keeps you riveted as any excellent thriller does.
B00CATSONE|5.0|It was amazing to me that such a genius lived and offered the world so much yet he has often gone unsung.  I wonder what was in his notes and paper that the government confiscated upon his death.<br />What a contribution to humanity and the sciences.
0143057375|5.0|My kind of read...for it brings a widening of the brain in seeing things we do not focus on and educating us on new things.
B00EHMG358|5.0|I have only had the chance to read the first nine chapters as the whole book hasn't been made available as of now.  But, those nine were great and again demonstrated their great writing ability.

B005GSZZ1A|4.0|You cannot stop reading. A Dark story that keeps your interest. This book really makes you want to do something to solve the problem in North Korea.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I find the lives of accomplished people fascinating. Whether you like the person or not, you can always learn something from them, famous or not. This book inspired me to be more of me.
B001M0HGR2|5.0|The whole family loves this movie.  My only complaint- I wish it came in a Blu-ray, DVD, Digital Copy format.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|My favorite series of all time!!! Can't wait for the rest of the books to come out so I can read them!
B0054TKB8I|5.0|I have never been a werewolf or vampire person, but I am so glad my daughter told me about this show, I am hooked!
B00DMEQP46|5.0|MGMT's musical career has moved in dramatic steps, from the hippest, brightest spotlight to the weirdest depths of psych pop.  They loaded the first half of their first album with intelligent ear candy, and then challenged the listener with time changes and odd space jams on the second half.  Further challenging the listener, they went nowhere near the dance floor on their sophomore album, save for a one minute tease in a song titled \\"Something's Missing\\", which immediately preceded their strangest song to date, \\"Flash Delirium\\". For their self-titled third album, MGMT continues to challenge the listener and their fans with dark, electronic psych that mines the same sonic fields that The Flaming Lips and Animal Collective indulge in during their darker moments.<br />  The two brightest spots on \\"MGMT\\" appear in key spots, signalling that the band knew what it was doing when it sequenced the album.  The opener \\"Alien Days\\", while nowhere near melodic enough to have made the cut on \\"Oracular Spectacular\\", nonetheless signals the return of a more accessible band. This would not last for long.  With each subsequent track, the vocals get more buried, the hooks fade to non-existent, and the aural assault, both musically and through the production, gets more harrowing. It is only in the penultimate song, \\"Plenty of Girls in the Sea\\", does any resemblance of pop music return, couched in a sing along sea shanty reminiscent of a Mollusk-era Ween track.<br />  Each listen reveals new depth to the album.  Creating a vibe not too far removed from their \\"Late Night Tales\\" collection, \\"MGMT\\" may not get you dancing like \\"Electric Feels\\" did, but the music will challenge and satisfy you in ways few bands are able.  A psych classic for the modern age.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I love  anything that has Robert Downey Jr. and the rest of this case in it.  There is nothing not to enjoy.

B00BYM5I1O|5.0|I have listened to this CD daily since I received it.  It is truly a classic.  Guy Clark is like fine wine - just gets better with age.  A beautiful, thoughtful album.  Love &#34;Cornmeal Waltz&#34;, &#34;My Favorite Picture of You&#34; and pretty much every single song on this.
B00DHHWY9I|5.0|Like many people, I had to write a book report on The Great Gatsby in high school.  You always get stuck writing about a Pulitzer Prize winning author.  The movie was absolutely delightful.  Leo DiCapprio did another splendid acting job.  Watching the movie made the book better.  Love the sound track.  Of course, it is a tragedy and the hero dies in the end but that is what makes a great tragedy.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|A highly researched, documented and ultimately believable account. An excellent lay person's guide to everything currently known about the historical Roman province of Judea, and how Jesus of Nazareth interacted with that world.
B006RXQ6XE|4.0|I have to admit. Copland was one of those movies that came out and didn't grab my interest. There was just nothing interesting to me in the trailers or commercials. It wasn't until years later, when I heard that this film was actually decent that I decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />Well, I was very impressed with Stallone's acting. When it came to portraying a lovable loser, he got the part nailed down pat. Probably because in some ways, Freddie is very similar to Rocky, except this guy doesn't have any ambition like Rocky did. I found the whole world of cop land very fascinating, it's very interesting to see how cops would live above the law. The acting was really well done and it was refreshing to see Ray Liotta NOT play a bad guy for once!<br /><br />You really start to care for the characters, and the movie takes its time to build up to that climax. Make no mistake though, it still feels like a small town problem in a small town. There's no big sweeping change that affects the country, only the little town of Cop Land.<br /><br />I wish there was a bit more Robert DeNiro in this movie, but the way the movie plays out, his character almost isn't necessary which is a real shame. Either way, it was an enjoyable movie to watch and eventually delivers on people getting their just desserts.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Works nice to read my Kindle books on my cell phone.  makes what I invest in books very reasonable! Like it.
0345347951|5.0|I just finished this book today and I am completely satisfied with this being the final ending to the Space Odyssey series. No other book has filled me of complete and utter appreciation for being human and the gratitude towards our Creator, than when I finished reading the Quran. I have so much love for our \\"Lord of the Worlds\\" amplified from reading this book. I literally had tears of compassion for our unlikely guardians who were created to watch over us, but never allowed the gift that mankind and other beings get to experience. What an amazing view of the universe and the worlds in which surround us. The role that we humans play is laid out so clearly in a way that makes complete sense even though it is called a sci-fi book. If you have never read the Quran, you will learn why Clarke said later on in his life why Islam seemed to \\"appeal to him most out of all religions\\", even though he himself was Buddhist.In this book is the basics of Islam wrapped into an interstellar journey into the outer-limits of God. I am astounded by Arthur C. Clarke once again and wouldn't be surprised if he was an advanced soul guiding us along our evolutionary path too...
B0089LOG02|5.0|Five stars a must for a great book.  I was never legally adopted so in a way I related to Vivian.  Totally surprised at Vivian giving the baby up for adoption, but in my personal situation that is what my father did with me, so I do understand where she is coming from.
B00BUAFBW6|2.0|Digital kindle version was horrible. No text search. Need to zoom in to read. Should have purchased the physical copy.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|Very good and pretty true to the essence of Star Trek.  I would definitely recommend this movie to any and all that like sci-fi or action movies.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|just what i needed....thankyou so much for helping me  get it. I use Amazon for almost all of my tech needs.
0060899220|5.0|I love this book; i've read it several times because it's easy to read, it's funny, smart, no superfluous mumbo jumbo, unpretentious, and sarcastic.<br />Anthony Bourdain tells it like it is, and it's what makes this book such a great read.<br />I've bought several other books from Anthony Bourdain, and have seen him speak, and again -- he speaks in person the way he writes in his books.<br />Buy it!
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Interesting characters and a multitude of stories. I enjoy watching the character development of the American Horror Story series. If you enjoyed season one, Asylum won't disappoint.
B00A0ABQLM|4.0|Good product yet seems to overheat when used for an extended period of time. Product in very good shape and form.
B00F2P8ZDC|5.0|and the 3d makes an old favorite even better! I highly recommend, a true Disney classic by all standards! Enjoy!
B00EJ2WBX4|5.0|Saw them live at the Belly Up in Solana Beach, California. They put on a really great show. Very solid gig that raised the hairs on the back of my neck... and that says a lot in my book.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|At first glance this game looks like Tetris, but it's not. Your basic line removal game with a Zen setting makes coming and going no hassle. I didn't think I would enjoy this game as much as I have. I only play Zen mode because my kids are a distraction. Great game over all. As an added bonus, in the settings you can even set the game tiles if you are color blind. I like this option, shows the developers really put some thought into their users.
B00A88FLI0|5.0|is an excellent toy for the childrens,  I like that they use the imagination and have a funny moment whitout tv.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Oh my gosh it is amazing and really inspiring. I really loved it. I just want to read it again.
B005BGBPBG|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie. Had many of the elements for a successful romantic comedy. Check out the shutters ([...] in Rachel's bedroom window.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Perfect, Perfect,  Perfect! I cannot waot until more apps become avaliable.  I use this everyday! I have also used this on my ipod.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|One crime for the whole season--intriguing ! The depth and the mystery<br />Each episode pulling one further in to a real situation . Real sadness and the heart and courage life takes. Can't wait for next season to come out.
B0031CCADY|5.0|The 'Dollhouse' was one of those rare television series that you might find to be so cleverly conceived that you are left wondering if even the writers, producers and actors were fully aware of its cleverness. If you really pay close attention to this series, you may come away with a new viewpoint on how the Universe might just work to the satisfaction of all.<br />For instance, think about the possibilities of time-travel or reincarnation.  If such things were actually possible, would you really want to experience them while carrying around all the excess baggage of prior existence and prior memories?  Or would you rather that your memory be entirely wiped clean so that you could start anew and enjoy the thrill of experiencing life's varieties with a fresh slate as a new person, never having to utter the immortal words of true boredom - \\"Been there, done that.\\"?  Perhaps then, death is merely a necessity of time travel and completely forgetting prior existence is essential to fresh opportunity. Watch the series again and think about it.<br /><br />Then again, maybe I'm just one of those fools that sees more than is really there.<br /><br />...never mind then...
B001TM14VC|5.0|I first watched this movie by vcr back in 1986.  I had just bought a new JVC cassette deck from an old Highland Electronics store and they gave a copy of this vhs movie to buyers of new gear.  Great sound then with my vcr hooked up to a 1973 Magnavox 1000 stereo receiver.  Recently, I watched this movie via Amazon Instant Video and my Roku 3 connected to a Yamaha RX-V673 surround sound receiver.  Great picture and great sound again.  Very enjoyable movie with loud sound effects and music from among others like the group &#34;Berlin&#34;.  This is a Jerry Bruckheimer production earlier in his film career.  This guy does so many movies and tv shows he must not need much sleep.  If you enjoy movies of fighter jets and aircraft carriers, then this movie is for you.  Tom Cruise, Kelly McGillis, Anthony Edwards, Tom Skerritt, and many others play believable and interesting rolls.  Highly recommended to watch and or watch again.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I absolutely love this series! I was recommending it before I even finished it! It's been a long time since I have read something that I could discuss with my friends and family! I cannot wait to read more of his books! Please read this, it's more than worth it!
B0083Z614S|5.0|It wasn't that<br /> good of a book but it was ok. Some of the parts I didn't get was when they talked Old Yorkshire
B008Q00BOQ|4.0|These movies are all put together really well, have that fast-paced John Woo feeling to them and Tom Cruise is a pretty good action hero.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I am so happy they finally got this game for kindle fire, I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!! It is the best!!!!!!!
B006PIXKVW|4.0|I watched this with my 8 year old son and while even he could fairly well predict what would happen next, I felt it was a good way to reinforce our family values.  It shows what happens when bad people dominate a group of good people, and that it's important for the good people to continue doing good, no matter what.  Justice is seen in the end.
B000MTOLDG|4.0|I bought this album because it was mentioned on a Motorhead live album. Since it was, I figured I would have to get it to check it out for myself. This is one of those albums that shows why Motorhead is Motorhead. The song &#34;Burner&#34; for example is quintessential Motorhead. This is gut level-in your face-unbridled rock & roll. Other songs like &#34;On your feet&#34; , &#34;Death or Glory&#34;, &#34;I am the sword&#34;,. &#34;Born to raise hell&#34;, &#34;Bad woman&#34;, &#34;Lost in the ozone&#34;, &#34;I'm your man&#34; and &#34;We bring the snake&#34; are just fun rock & roll. These are the kinds of songs that made Motorhead what it is, a band that can show others how rock & roll should be done. All the songs are not gems, no one can do that, songs like &#34;Don't let daddy kiss me&#34; is a sensitive song about the evils of child molestation. I considered &#34;Liar&#34; and &#34;Devils&#34; to be so-so. But, overall, it is like Motorhead says in their lyrics in &#34;Born to raise hell&#34;...We know how to do it and we do it real well&#34;, true words.
B003M6FGTE|1.0|lame. This show is poorly done, has inconsistent writing, and is overall just boring and tired. A fantastic show for anyone having a hard time sleeping or for those who care nothing about script or substance.
B00CS74W0C|3.0|50 shades was way better. Especially because it had an ending. I was very disappointed that after reading the trilogy, it left you hanging!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Let me preface... I've been counting down the day until this release for five months, expecting this to complete the trilogy, but NO! There's Book #4 and #5 still in the works! GRRRR! So, this book continues the story of Gideon Cross and Eva Trammel. It starts off with Nathan's murder and if Gideon was involved. This book was not short on steaminess, but (I can't believe I'm going to say this)... that's about all there was to this book. A whole lot of nookie and not a whole lot of other storyline. I will say the events in the Caribbean were noteworthy without giving away what happened. Eva's BFF Cary and all his many trysts made me dizzy keeping up with who's who. I also started getting a little confused by all the different characters that come and go. I appreciated the fact the author was touching on some deep emotional issues within Gideon and Eva. I got bored and irritated with how completely jealousy Eva got... it was almost like she WANTED to pick a fight. So... overall, this book was a bit of a let down for how long I've been waiting for its release, but now I have to wait again to finally get to the ending. Sigh...
B000I0XLYO|4.0|I can't believe it took me this long to watch this movie. I know it is stupid...very SNL type humor...but it was good for a laugh.<br />The only scene I could do without is the \\"orgy\\" scene (they don't show anything), because that was a little to icky for me. The rest is just ridiculous. I normally like \\"brainy\\" stuff, but sometimes you just need some dumb laughs, and skewering the fashion industry did it for me. (Not a fan of movies like Dumb & Dumber...)
B005723JSQ|4.0|This was a long book and literally took me all day to finish, so my eyes are bugging out a bit. This was a fairly cute book - more like a comedy/mystery and not a romance novel (at all.) It's also set in England, so you have to get used to the slang. So... after just a month, Poppy is engaged to Magnus. He gave her his family heirloom emerald and diamond ring... which she just happens to lose a week before the wedding at a hotel. She is frantically searching for the lost ring when her cell phone gets swiped right out of her hand. You don't understand... she is TIED to that cell phone. Anyone that can't live without their phone, texts and emails will understand this. Now how are the hotel staff going to contact her about the ring when/if it turns up? Low and behold, she notices a company cell phone is a trash bin. She quickly &#34;borrows&#34; it, gives the number out and that's when the comedy begins. The phone immediately rings with Sam calling, thinking it's his assistant (who just quit on him in the middle of THE biggest business deal). Poppy helps Sam out, now Sam owes her one. She asks if she can keep the phone just until the ring is found. Sam very reluctantly agrees, and insist Poppy forward all emails and texts to him until IT gets the stuff routed directly to him. Poppy can't help but read all the texts and emails and quickly starts &#34;intervening&#34; as Sam's unofficial assistant, which of course creates a lot of havoc. Things get super hairy when Sam's company is in the middle of a government scandal but Poppy can save him. Oh yeah, then there's this teeny tiny thing about the wedding plans. I can't give that away though The texting back and forth was cute, but the book was really overpriced on Amazon.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|The graphics are ok, but the gameplay is very fun.  If you are a lover of endless runner games, then you will definitely love this game.  The challenge is not only sticking the landing after you jump, but also when you need to let go of the swing for momentum.  There aren't really any powerups to buy unfortunately, at least none of the permanent kind.  And characters are unlocked automatically as you go.<br />But all in all, a great game, that I have a hard time putting down.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Best. Book. EVER! I have never laughed so hard in my life! It's written from the male point of view. Drew Evans is THE ladies man. He's the love-'em-and-leave-'em guy. He's fiercely dedicated to his job, including his Saturday night club trolling... until he's stopped dead in his tracks by Katherine (Kate) Brooks. She's been with her douchebag boyfriend for almost 11 years and engaged for the last seven. But that's not going to stop Drew to get what he wants. Until the next day when he learns Kate is the newest addition at their investment banker firm. She's not only gorgeous but super smart with fresh, innovative ideas. Hmmm, does he break his rule of never getting involved with someone from work? Hell yes! The male POV Drew shares is some of the funniest lines I've ever read! Better than &#34;Wallbanger&#34;!
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|Good on the basics.....I thought it would go further than that and didn't feel it did......I would recommend it to someone just starting on their spiritual journey.......
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Delightful characters, beautiful settings, wonderful acting. I LOVE this series!! And very interesting social commentary without being preachy, which is refreshing. I highly recommend watching this if you enjoy period pieces.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|People who enjoy English acting, history and stories.  This one has great characters.  Love the scenery and<br />a glimpse of life in the 19th Century.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Not Cliché.  Loved it.  The plot flowed well and the characters were interesting. It did not disappoint.  Brad Pitt was believable.
0345404475|5.0|A little different than the movie and classic sci-fi.  Good even if you're not that into sci-fi.  Would buy again.
B0063IH60K|2.0|The game worked fine when I installed it but when I tried to use it camping with no wifi nothing happened. I removed it from my device.
0399255370|5.0|My 4 1/2 year old daughter laughs out loud every time we read this book ... and it has a happy ending.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|Excellent movie with a great amount of action and thrill's.  Nice twist to the story of Hansel & Gretal as well.  It is a well worth while movie to watch and well worth the cost.  Excellent quality watching it rented through my Amazon prime through my ROKU player.  I am seriously thinking of buying the DVD to add it to my movie collection.  As the watch was so fun. :)
B003YU2HSQ|3.0|I have watched this movie many times, and always greatly enjoyed it, but I watch bad movies as a hobby.  Like &#34;The Core&#34; and &#34;2012&#34;, &#34;The Day After Tomorrow&#34; is full of science errors and logic holes, cliche characters, and impossible feats.  It is enjoyable, but you should go into it knowing the silliness you are about to view.  The effects are quite good.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|With the action and twist's and turns in this season.  Keep's me on my seat wondering what is going to come up next that might not be expected and what is yet to come with what is known.  Look forward to seeing what new things happen and see what become's of the whole situation.  Well worth the watch. :)
B005544V6A|5.0|Suits is witty and smart!  Shows like this really make you wonder if you could get away with a secret life.
B00DU74U74|5.0|Excellent movie with entensity that keeps you riveted on your seat.  It is action packed and with great things that are worth the watch.  I am seriously considering buying the DVD when I get the means to add it to my collection of movies. :)  Watching it on my Prime w/my Roku it came through with no issue's and was in great quality.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|I love this movie, i wish it was free to view with prime. I will just have to buy it for my self. (=^_^=)
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|I didn't like this film originally.  Maybe it's because I was such a fan of the Godfather, and considered everything else a rip off.  But...something kept me coming back and watching it again.  I never quite knew what it was that I liked about it, then I saw a review that pointed out that this movie is from the viewpoint of an outsider that was a part of it, vs. the view of those entirely on the inside (Godfather).  Now, picking which film I like best would be impossible, I think.
B00FB6FOEU|5.0|If you haven't yet, you must treat yourself to a Joan Jett concert. Such incredible energy and a fun time! And it translates well to her latest release. This album is straight up, head-bobbing rock and roll! -- just like her concerts! And I love her personal reflections about where she's at in life and the commentary about Facebook and reality TV in the lyrics. A really fun album!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Beyond excellent! Amazing read! I am a teacher, and will share this with my students, as well as recommend it to every adult. Going to buy it to keep forever!
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|The acting is phenomenal.  The story is very compelling.  The pace<br />is slow but it works for this show.  Surprising ending!
B005544TRQ|4.0|Gripping enough to keep you watching but not over gripping that you have to watch it all in one session.<br /><br />Funny, inspired and engaging.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a very fun and additive game if you like Sim games you have got to get it it is a blast
B005544V6A|5.0|A really good show with great character plots. Also the characters aren't bad looking themselves. Although I'm not a lawyer or in law school the law they use seems very realistic.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Stephen King, what can I say. Short story but scary, suspenceful, dark. He of course is one of my favorites
B002ZB26AO|5.0|I rated this five stars because the author tells compelling stories about everyday North Koreans. What I liked is that I learned what it must be like to live in such a society. I would recommend this book to anyone that has an interest in North Korea or totalitarian regimes.
8867320793|5.0|I love these things.  They are well put together and sturdy.  Additionally they have a very classic style.  The red color contrasting with the black is pretty.
B008JFUPFI|3.0|The concept of this movie seemed awesome.  It even started off strong with an original view of Krypton.  But it quickly slows down from there.  I love the Superman movies and this was one of the most anticipated releases.  I expected a strong story and action.  While there was no shortage of action, the story was disconnected and at times boring.
B0078ZTWP4|4.0|This is an inexpensive bright LED lantern. I have used it a couple of times and love the way it illuminates the area. I'm not crazy about the LED that stays on flashing when the lantern is turned off. I assume is a low consumption feature useful to find the lantern in the dark... however, when kept inside the tent during camping it was quite annoying. I had to remove the batteries to shut it off and be able to sleep in the dark!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game it's really good never had a problem with it loading it's really fun love all the different minions and places
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|After catching snippets of the plot in his later books, I'm glad Nesbo finally decided to have his first two books translated into English.  The Bat may not have as many twists as his later works, but it is a solid entertaining read that gives a sense of who Harry will become.
B00908DDZM|5.0|One of the best albums ever!!!!!!!!! Nice to hear rap that's not violent or sexist. I want to be buried with it.
B005ZB91KY|4.0|this movie covers everything everything but I have to rewatch it I fell asleep and you know how that goes
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|A dictionary is an essential tool in anyones kindle. I watch shows that give the word of the day and it's nice having access to a tool that can help with definitions. Excellent application.
B003F44QRQ|4.0|many years ago this was one of my favorite movies with vampires it rocks so im very happy with it
B008MYYODK|5.0|I am an ardent Wagnerian. This collection should be acquired by everyone who loves the Wagner operas. Not only the many discs of excepts from various performers at various times prove fascinating, but the recordings of the complete operas are in their own right among the greatest interpretations of these masterpieces. As far as I am concerned, no other recording of Parsifal can even come close to Knappertsbusch 1952 interpretation (not even his later stereo recording). Karajan's early 50s Tristan and Meistersinger are equally among the best recordings of these works. No Wagnerian should be without this set.
B0067TGSOK|4.0|This book is easy to read and fun to hear other peoples stories even though more depth would have been nice.
B003XWFLTM|5.0|This was a gift to a friend for her birthday. I have read rave reviews of Pletnv's Tchaikovsky and have heard some of his interpretations on the radio.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|The best show I've seen in a long time. Tatiana Maslany is a fantastic actress! The acting overall is great.<br />Twist and turns galore!
0763639184|5.0|A favorite story of my grandson.<br />The colorful fish, all shapes and sizes,with names to match. He memorized all the pages and delighted<br />in the friendship that the book created between little fish and his new friends.<br />But, Mom fish, was the one he loved the most!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is great. It has so many things you can do with it. Helps for day to day living. Just one more way to keep me closer to God. That in itself is a blessing.  If you only have a few minutes a day , this app will be a joy.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|This had me hooked right from the beginning, and by the end I was struggling to read it through my tears.  I have never been so overcome with emotion as I have with this beautiful story.  I could not put it down, I could clearly envision the characters as though they were real to me.<br />I cannot wait to read another Jojo Moyes book.
B00F2P8ZDC|5.0|This movie dives deep with rich animation and lovely music. My  four year old watched it on VHS last year with her grandmother and couldn't stop talking about Ariel! A year later we had a mermaid  sea themed birthday and as she says, &#34; I'm going to be a mermaid,  mommy!&#34;.<br />I recommend this movie to all children due to the theme,  lively characters and kind message of acceptance and understanding.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Defending Jacob is well-written, but profoundly disturbing to read. That the events that unfold could happen (and maybe have more than once) is unnerving. It's a good read if you don't mind waking in the middle of the night thinking about the story. I gave it four stars instead of five because some passages went on long after I, as a reader, got the message .
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|Fun game. I have spent way too much time on this. It is very addictive. You need to take a good look at it before you start to solve it. It can be tricky and there's only one solution. Be patient &amp; enjoy.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|This is a great cop show with fine acting and a brilliant touch of the personal. The small town, seaside location is both intimate and beautiful.
0783225482|3.0|great viewing<br />This video is watched over and over again<br />its a great laugh and easy to watch -<br />its good to laugh - we could all do it more
B00A83075M|5.0|A great family movie. My husband loves it as much as our kids do! Funny and sweet without being sappy; nostalgic without being esoteric.
B007THA4FI|3.0|It was ok but a little disappointed.  Not the kinda book that I just couldn't put down, but I did read it all not just deleted it.
B002QNTNL6|4.0|Keep you interested. Good movie and good actors  Get to see London city and the beautiful sceneries. Ends well. Ok
1609611543|4.0|Great book didn't know gluten could cause such problems.  Looking forward to getting better with my IBS. I have already referred many people to read it.
0307352153|5.0|Helps me understand the difference in the personalities of others - and helps me to appreciate both the Extroverts and the Introverts!  Both equally contribute to all of us!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I think diary of a wimpy kid the third wheel should be rated 5 stars because it has extremely funny parts like because it has funny romance,it all happens over the winter and the chicken pox and pants pulling is going around.
B00594XOZU|5.0|When are you fixing kik on kindle fires?!?!?!? Please do it soon. Why is it like this? Fix it soon! -.-
B001T3WJYW|4.0|as a second book the condition is pretty good, with a few highlights but totally readable! like it and recommendable
B002C949KE|5.0|This is an entertaining book that shows several elements how we are influenced in our decision making from decoys, social contracts to free lunch. This is a must read for any business leader, product manager, software engineer, web analyst, or even a marketing professional. This books just proves that we are social animal and in most cases unpredictable in our decision making process which is probably the most predictable trait we have.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|over the years this show just went over my head so i just ignored it. then i was hearing all kinds of great reviews of it a few weeks ago when the final show aired.  i went to netflix to see the pilot from 5 years ago and i got hooked.  i ignored any mention of the finale and watching all the seasons up to now.
B00F91G5BS|2.0|I was in and out during this movie. It was OK, but those are the craziest zombies I have seen.  I wouldn't watch it again.
B00FN8HS5O|5.0|Gravity is, without question, one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life, which certainly isn't what I was expecting when I strolled into the theater this past weekend. I have officially been blown away. Every aspect of this movie has been crafted with an attention to detail and a sense of perfectionism that ensures the moviegoer that this project was an absolute labor of passion, and not some big budget cash-in. In my opinion, Gravity has completely changed the definition of what an \\"action movie\\" or a \\"sci fi movie\\" or a \\"drama\\" can be.<br /><br />That level of perfectionism and attention to detail extends to the soundtrack, which fits the mood and on-screen action like a glove. As the protagonist, Ryan, is subjected to a wild array of powerful emotions, the orchestral soundtrack perfectly matches her feelings, further amplifying them and putting the spectator in her shoes (or space boots, in this case). Whether Ryan is fighting for another breath of oxygen, attempting to survive a wave of space debris, or desperately trying to escape from yet another deteriorating device, the music elevates the mood masterfully- I found myself holding my breath along with her. Gravity is a work of art, and it wouldn't be the same without this terrific soundtrack. It's not so much a movie, it's more like an event or a journey - and it has left me stunned.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Plenty of thrills and spills with lots of the unexpected.  The author has a knack of getting lots of detail woven into the broad tapestry of this saga.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|The new characters are great. My favorite is Yoda. I like that there are two sets of games...Bird Side and Pork Side for each level. Having lots of fun with it.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Great read for those that have read the other four (4) Volumes in the saga.  Plenty of surprises (and disappointments for various characters).
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is a fun game.  I had the first version and now this one, which is very similar, with a few great updates.  I didn't care very much for version 2 and so switched to this EVO version.  Very engrossing and stress relieving.  Most of all, it's fun!  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a game with beautifully done graphics and achievable goals.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Had I written \\"The Husband's Secret,\\" one thing is for sure: it would have been a much shorter read. It begins with one of the three central characters debating on whether or not to open an envelope addressed to her - written by her husband and marked \\"Open Only On The Event Of My Death.\\" (paraphr.) Now maybe it's just me, but I don't think I'm alone in saying that had I run across such a missive, it would have been opened faster than you can say, \\"paper cut.\\" Even if I did manage to perch vicariously on the edge of the moral high ground, I would have fallen off face first just the second my hubby whispered (in a trembling voice), \\"Please don't open it.\\" But wait Aussie housewife Cecelia does through over half the book, so despite her charmingly honest inner-rhetoric, I find her simply un-relatable therefore somewhat unlikable.<br /><br />The author, Liane Moriarty, graciously provides the reader with several other Australian women with which to connect. (I related well to Tess' fat friend, Felicity, who lost weight and after doing so, stole Tess' husband, Will). Tess, Cecelia and Rachel are the three main characters in the novel and their secrets intertwine and eventually implode - causing their neatly arranged lives to temporarily become chaotic before rearranging and settling into different patterns.<br /><br />It is difficult to write to detailed a review without spoiling the book for other readers. I will say that while some of the mysteries are a bit transparent, that doesn't take away from the fun of getting to the answers. This would be an excellent book club selection because of the different personalities - finely-drawn and entertainingly written. The Epilogue is particularly well-executed and perhaps the only part of the book not predictable to any real degree. I highly recommend The Husband's Secret as an illuminating expose of the average middle-class family and the secrets they possess.
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|This is my favorite Dash game out of all of them.  On my Kindle Fire, though, the movements of Flo, the waitress, are not very smooth at all.  There is a slight hesitation before she does the action that you have touched.  This game works great on my ipod touch.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|Forrest Gump is a wonderful movie with many lesson of life.  We as people, only look on the outside and see and make judgements about a person.  Forrest shows us people can be great with even though not perfect or the  smart  one in  class.  Every person has  an inner quality of greatness that most of times is simply over looked because they are different.
B00DJ80VLS|4.0|This album is nothing short of great. But nothing more than great as well. A few songs on this album hold it back from being one of their best.  I will discuss this further in the track by track.<br /><br />For now I will talk about why this is a step in the right direction.  What I love most about this album is the true Dream Theater song writing popping up reminding us of some if their early work.  Although the drum mix (especially the snare) is a little flat, we are hearing Myung instead of double kick drumming that is basically overtaking the low end.  The guitars aren't too loud as well which leaves room again for Myung and Rudess.  Contrary to every other review in the past. I found James Labrie's vocals a little weak on their last effort and stronger than ever on this one.  Just my opinion though.<br /><br />Track by track:<br />1:  False Awakening Suite is a cool start to the album, but as far as theatric intros go, it's a pass for me. It worked in Six Degrees as the intro on that was an overture and contained what was to come on the following tracks. Really nothing to talk about on this one 3/5<br /><br />2: The Enemy Inside once again doesn't put this album on the right foot for me. One thing I do like is the heaviness both of the John's create.. The verse is actually quite cool except the chorus really has that mainstream hook going on that just turns me off, along with the instrumental guitar/keyboard trade off and back into mediocre chorus. This I can safely say can go into the vault with Build me up, Break me down. 3/5<br /><br />3: The Looking Glass is where this album should have started! Awesome intro which reminds of Innocence Faded, or anything from Images and Words. This no doubt should have been the single. Everything about this song is timeless. Need I say more? 5/5<br /><br />4: Enigma Machine is nice little instrumental that is made to just pound you in the face I guess. It's heavy, it's complex, it's short, it's......a touch cheesey. But inthat good kinda way. Reminds me a little of Erotomania. 4/5<br /><br />5: The Bigger Picture is probably my favourite off this album. Again that Dream Theater cheese we want is there.  This song get's sadder every time I hear it. Everything here works for me. Beats all the ballads on ADTOE hands down and I am just hearing something new and exciting from the boys with this one. The outro is unexpected but makes the song that much more cooler.  James sounds perfect and the vocal lines are very powerful. A very well earned 5/5<br /><br />6:  Behind The Vale is a song that shoots you into several directions and before you know it you are hit with a classic Dream Theater chorus.  The intro is very cool and sad. Hard rock sort of feel on this one which is cool. One of the better songs on this album holding it together. 4/5<br /><br />7: Surrender to Reason Is another Myung entry into the lyrical category.  Very old school element to this song. Lots of fun riffs surrounding a powerful shiver making chorus. The bass in this song is awesome, whether it be the fills in the chorus or the absolutely face melting Petrucci/Myung solo section which is just super awesome. This song chops and changes in all the right ways. A special prog rock track from DT. 5/5<br /><br />8: Along For The Ride just does not do it for me. It's nice but it is nothing new and a safe ballad, light years away from The Bigger Picture. The song however has a nice middle section. 3/5<br /><br />9: illumination Theory is a great one. I have heard it probably 20 times and I still feel like I'm listening to it for the first time. Nothing is better than a song that gives you shivers, this song achieves that somewhere in the middle when Jordan drops the strings on us ( or at least his amazing compositional skills) and the shivers continue through the odd time drum and bass opener and all the way through when Labrie's vocals are super fierce and high. The drums make the end of this song as well without overplaying or taking away from the other instrumentalists.  This song is such an opus that if false awakening suite contained parts of this it would make more sense and complete the album.  This song is on the same level as some if their other epics. Just give it time to grow on you. 5/5<br /><br />Buy this album. It tops the last one even if it is not as consistent.  Even the not so good songs I still listen to everyday so it can't be that bad.<br /><br />(Apologies for any poor grammar or spelling in this review. My thumb is cramping like a bitch and my iPhone is not the best vessel for review writing)<br /><br />Happy listening.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|lots of fun. harder than you would think considering its the minions. great for the whole family and fun competition
B000GWE44U|5.0|I love how meticulous this director was in making this film. Some say there's even a Apollo 11 Moon Landing hoax filming cover-up conspiricy laced throughout the film, representing Kubrick's lament, shame and horror that he had helped the American government cover up the &#34;fact&#34; that they had deceived the American public and the world. I'm not sure about it's accuracy, but hey, still fun to consider. You be the judge. See how many things you can find in the film that may have to do with the Apollo 11 mission.
B001CDLAT4|5.0|Beautifully structured film-meditation on the complexity, beauty, challenge, and wonder of being alive on the planet.  The human experience is included, in all its richness, including injustice, goodness, wisdom, and pain. The choice to eschew narrative, including only ambient music, sounds of nature, and sounds of activity in context invites us to simply be with what is. While the footage and editing naturally present a certain directorial pov, it allows the viewer a lot of room to be present and arrive at our own responses.
B00BRUPICM|5.0|Great story with some shocking twists. Alex is an attractive young woman who is kidnapped at the start of the story. She is beaten, locked up in a cage and left to die by a man who is extracting revenge because he thinks she convinced his doltish son to run away with her.  She didn't.<br /><br />Camille Verhoeven is the French police detective who is told to investigate her disappearance even though he has not yet recovered from the kidnapping and murder of his own wife.<br /><br />He has some problems of his own, not least of which is the fact that he is only 4 feet 9 inches tall and so is considered something of a joke by people who meet him in the course of his investigation.<br /><br />Alex is extremely resourceful and manages to foil her kidnapper's plan to kill her.  As the story goes on, we see that she is not so much a victim after all and Camille Verhoeven is no joke when it comes to investigating a hideous crime.<br /><br />This is immensely readable. I'm not sure if this is due to the translation or if the original is as compelling. The story flows well, moves fast, no slow or boring parts at all. Every chapter moves the story and the characters forward.<br /><br />Characterizations are excellent - a variety of police and past &#34;aquaintances&#34; of Alex' who appear over time.<br /><br />The story is also &#34;laugh out loud&#34; funny in parts. A description of a dance hall, the patrons and band members is hysterical in a very understated way.<br /><br />As the evidence mounts up towards a very surprising yet immensely satisfying ending to the story, you will not be able to put this book down.<br /><br />This is apparently part of a trilogy. I really hope that a translation of the other two instalments comes out soon.

B0084AZXKK|5.0|Have heard references about it since I was a child but have only read it now in my mid-40s.<br />Quite exciting, even though the use of &#34;old English&#34; can be a little baffling at times.<br /><br />EXCELLENT!
0307271609|5.0|Even people who don't know much about Chinese history think they know that the last empress was a dragon lady who resisted the West. Setting aside the sexist name-calling of an 1800's female with power, what Jung Chang shows is how this reputation was begat and flourished. Cixi was aware of it, but she couldn't expose the untruths without implicating her adopted son, the Emperor Guangxu. (She was, incidentally, never an Empress, only the Dowager Empress = mother of the Emperor, and, in any case, she was the penultimate Empress, not the last.)<br /><br />Emperor Guangxu, who had been sidelined when royal advisers (ie, the bureaucrats) realized he was inept and backward-thinking, gave his approval of Cixi's assassination by a Japanese agent. Then Japan would &quot;help&quot; him rule China. Why would Cixi refuse to publicize his part in inviting a foreign invasion?  Because, above all, she wanted the Qing dynasty to rule another 200 years.<br /><br />I was surprised to learn that the Dowager Empress Cixi had been the one behind modernizing China. She wasn't alone, but if she had said &quot;No&quot;, none of it would have happened in her lifetime. Railroads. Schools teaching modern subjects. Electricity and sewage systems for everyone. And I was flummoxed to learn that the Dowager Empress had been the brains behind bringing the vote to China. Before she died, she had started a nine-year plan to turn China into a constitutional monarchy.<br /><br />It didn't come to fruition. Less than four years after Cixi's death, the last Dowager Empress abdicated in the name of her 5 year-old son, decreeing: &quot;On behalf of the emperor, I transfer the right to rule to the whole country, which will now be a Constitutional Republic.&quot; That the republic didn't last and Japan finally did take over China is another book.<br /><br />Thanks to the painstaking document-keeping of the Chinese bureaucracy, writers such as Jung Chang can now piece together the truth about this astute ruler. Jung Chang doesn't white-wash Cixi, but he shows what she was up against. Her carefully deliberated balancing act reminds me of Elizabeth the Great of England. Her straining to bring her country into the next century while simultaneously authorizing brutal acts reminds me of Peter the Great of Russia.<br /><br />Because the author is careful to make this biography factual, it can be a little dry at times. But you always know from where he's getting his details (diary, letters, decrees, etc.), and there are no flights of fancy. I am reviewing from an Uncorrected Proof, but the published book will have 64 pages of Notes, Bibliography and Index at the end. In addition, the book has 59 black &amp; white photographs.<br /><br />A very interesting look at an amazing woman.<br /><br />Happy Readerler.

0385342039|5.0|Starts slow and then suddenly our heroine makes you care about her. I loved how with Sadie's pushing she took  all kinds of risks. I know this book is probably categorized as a light romance, but it is also makes one want to take chances in life and not just sit around and complain. (Of course, I am relieved not to have my great-aunt's ghost screaming in my ear.) We will be discussing \\"Twenties Girl\\" in book club and as hostess I am serving hor d'oeuvres and Perrier water in plastic cocktail glasses complete with grapes on tooth picks. (I don't like olives.) :)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I enjoyed all three books in this series. The scope of the project was impressive. The characterizations were great and the plot was exciting. Also, the length of the book seemed just right ... sometimes authors pad their books with unnecessary side plots, but not this one. Everything tied together nicely. Wonderful read!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Yes!!  There are pictures of anything you can think of. And you can make your own photo boards from other pictures you've pinned. Or you can search for any subject and it will bring up other people who have made photo boards based on whatever subject you were searching for, then if you want you can choose to follow that persons board and you'll automatically receive pins anytime they pin something new to their board. You can create lots of your own boards and you can also create secret boards only you can see. I love Pinterest, it's totally addicting and it's free.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Even though it's a lot of money,its fun for all of your friends and family. The greatest part about this is that it's similar to the one on the computer.
B00514HDNW|4.0|Not a bad book if not pretty short. I was able to read it in about 6 hours, so if you want something longer, this may not be the book for you. However, if you want something to read for a short trip, this book is perfect.

B00AESN8XY|5.0|I recently got a kindle and this is the first game that I bought for it. I do believe that there is a flash version of this game on the internet (or there was a few years ago at least) but this is a massive improvement over that version. It is completely worth .99 cents and has already delivered hours of entertainment and boredom killing and I still haven't unlocked everything. There are options to pay money to unlock everything immediately but all you have to do is play the game and you can get everything. Who thought killing all of the people on earth in extraordinarily painful ways while  civilization collapses around them would be so fun?

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chromecast looks like a very interesting device.  It was easy to set up, and also easy to change the setup.  I suspect that for streaming services it should work well.  However, I got it for one particular use, and unfortunately it doesn't yet work well for that.<br /><br />When travelling, I want to watch my home TiVo via a SlingBox.  That works very well.  It is more and more common to find either hotel rooms or vacation rentals with HDTVs (with HDMI ports) and WIFI internet access. Since I watch the SlingBox via a Chrome window, this seemed like the perfect solution to put the picture on the remote TV.  I ran into two separate problems with this (although the second one is the real show-stopper).  In one hotel room, the WIFI was not configured to allow the required plug-and-play connectivity between devices, and I knew better than trying to get that changed.  In a second location where I had more control over the network, everything connect just fine, but the only thing that would display from my Chrome tab with the Slingbox video was the frame of the tab, with a black rectangle where the video should be.  A little internet research showed that this is a known issue, but there's not any indication that either Google or SlingBox will address it.<br /><br />Update 11/19/2013:  After some research on the SlingBox issue, I found that the Chromecast will indeed work with SlingBox if you use the SlingBox Facebook app instead of the Slingbox.com window.  That takes away my concern for the product, and now feel that it works quite well for me.  I've watched (briefly for testing) video from the SlingBox Facebook app, from Xfinity's Video on Demand page, and live video from NASA TV.
B00821OX98|5.0|this show is awesome. You are on the edge of your seat. I didn't want to stop watching it!!! Once you start watching it  you will be part of the show. I was thinking of it even when I was not watching it!!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I normally don't read romance novels, but after several people told me I &#34;had to read it&#34;, I decided to take the plunge.  Most of the trilogy is totally unrealistic, but if you don't mind that, you may enjoy this book.  Don't expect a great book or engrossing story.  The author was smart with the ending though; she presented a cliff hanger at the very end, which makes you want to read the second book in this mediocre trilogy.
0062080237|4.0|I find most Gaiman novels spend a good 75% of the story building up to something and then falling flat in the ending 25%. This book was no different for me. However the 75% of build up is one hell of a ride that does not dissapoint. There is so much world building and different religions. It piqued my interest enough to want to go out and pick up some norse god tomes as well as some ancient egyptian religious materials.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The three books of this trilogy are all just OK.  I do not normally read romance novels, but based on some friends' recommendations, I decided to read them all.  I ended up skipping a lot of the racier scenes, because they were long and often boring.  The main premise of the trilogy was good, but three books, each over 500 pages is very overdone.  It should have been one book.  I am not planning on seeing the movie.
1594746036|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. The pictures and descriptive narrative enhance and illuminate the storyline in a way that the reader is not left to their own imagination when it comes to picturing such &#34;Peculiars&#34;. I am very much looking forward to the sequel next year!
B007ZGBZHE|1.0|Poorly written, disorganized. Boring and irrelevant sub-plots.  The dark delight of earlier work is gone.  I am finished with these authors.  One star
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I like this new character.  I enjoy the story line  and interesting personalities that pepper it.  There are many interesting twists that take you down roads you would never have anticipated.  With all that said it still makes sense at the end.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great acting and story line.  I highly recommend this for those who like history and drama. Looking forward to season three.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is a fun game. It requires thought and patience. I wish that there were more puzzles in each level.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This reminds me of Soduko, which I'm not very good at. You have to find the missing object in the picture.  There are 3 sizes of the puzzle 5x5 squares, 10x10 squares and 15x15 squares. No matter the size it's the same picture, in other words you use the same picture 3 times. It gets complicated and very challenging. I finally created sheets of squares to keep track of the good squares I had located because you are only allowed 3 mistakes. You can get really wrapped up in this and not want to stop.  I do like it and I'm better at this than soduko.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|Story is about a rogue cop who is a killer.  Can't wait to see him get caught and pay for his crimes!
B00CGNYDIE|1.0|I will admit that I may not be the sharpest crayon in the box, but come on.  The directions on how this games works is not correct and the game doesn't work the way it says.  I got someone else to try, they read the instructions then tried to do the game like it says and it did work any better for them either. You have to pick a tile, keep trying all the colors until you finally get a match to get an opening in the picture.  Then you try to match what you seen in the picture and not the color shown on the tiles. According to the instructions, if for example, the dot or all the dots on the tile is yellow, the color to chose is yellow. No, in reality it can be any of the other colors and 9 times out of 10 it will not be what is on the tile.  Unfortunaly I bought 2 of these games. I will complete them because that's just me but after I do, they will be removed from my divice. This is not fun.

B0035OC830|1.0|I have loved other books by Bryson.  \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" was a true adventure.  I laughed almost as much as I learned.  \\"A Sunburned Country,\\" and other books were equal joys, which is why, \\"The Lost Continent\\" was such a leaden disappointment.  It lacks all of Bryson's signature wit-infused detail and engaging information.  Instead it is instilled with cynicism and distain for so many of the places he visited.  He didn't like any of them and mostly thumbed his nose as he passed through.  It is also poorly written.  Very unlike him.  It reads like he was forced to somehow make a few sentences from his jotted travel notes, something he barely gave any effort too.  It was clearly a burden for him to write, but not as much as it was to read.

B0056BMK6K|4.0|At first i thought this was one of those 'blow-your-own-trumpet' books, but it does have some good points in it. If you don't like someone who appears at first to be in your face, then it isn't for you, unless you are going to keep reading. If you do, you will find his strategies sound. For him anyway.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I've been in radio broadcasting for 22+ years now, and during that time, I've used my fair share of studio headsets. Honestly, for me, my absolute NEEDS weigh slightly more than what you may personally need when making your choices. Since I wear my headphones roughly 4-5 hours a day, five days a week, I'm looking for durability as much as almost anything else. I've seen a LOT of cheap to very expensive monitors which, upon day-to-day actual use ended up wearing out a lot quicker than expected...some embarrassingly so. My original first pair of Sony's lasted me 12 years--and again, those are 12 years of HEAVY usage. On the flipside, I've spent a lot (some would say way too much) on brands such as, Phillips, Panasonic, Sennheiser, Koss, Shure, Audio-Technica and I have extensively used pairs made by Beats as well as Bose (I'm sure I've missed several different models over the years), and while some were much better than I had expected (Phillips), I was profoundly disappointed with Beats. Let's just say some are better than others, and not all are created equal. If you want bass and nothing but--yeah, Beats will do the trick--even though I can name several pair of monitors which deliver just as much bass for one-third the cost. But in true professional broadcasting, you need much more than just the bass hitting hard and heavy. This is where the MDR 7506's really shine.<br /><br />In my personal opinion, I've never heard a pair of headphones which sounded better than the Bose Quiet Comfort's. The downside is pretty big for me, though: if you can get past the expense, they simply are not built to last me years of use in the way that I need them. In fact, considering their price, I am pretty well UN-impressed with their build quality. They simply sound awesome, though. I went through a phase where I felt I just HAD to have noise cancelling headphones, and that was thankfully not a phase which continues. They're great if you go on planes regularly (which is what they were originally designed for) but for MY money, the additional price was simply not justified. I know enough that whatever I buy MUST cover my entire ear, making the noise cancelling aspect rather moot. I personally don't like the models which are gaining in popularity that sit ON the air, and not cover it. They just aren't as comfortable to me. In truth, Sony now has a few models which were manufactured (I'd wager) to compete directly with Beats, and they are as close to being comfortable as I've tried, and certainly sound every bit as good as anything with a big 'B' on the side, and are much cheaper by comparison, too--but just not for me. I like to hear the ENTIRE audio spectrum, and those types focus almost entirely on the lower end, and while that's great if you enjoy rap music in the extreme--but again, not my cup of tea.<br /><br />Comfort is another area which is important when you wear these things for hours on end...and while I've seen a few reviews which state the exact opposite of my experience, I personally find my Sony's to be remarkably comfortable. But everybody is different of course. I won't presume to tell you that because they fit MY head great, that they'll fit yours, too. As with most purchases, if at all possible, TRY them ON first. Doing so goes a long way towards saving you a lot of money in the long run--trust me. I mean they let you test drive a car before buying it--why not headphones, right?<br /><br />Okay, let's get to the last important thing: sound quality. Of that, there is NO debate in my opinion. Either your headphones reproduce sound great or they don't. The MDR 7506's just excel in sound quality, simply put. They capture the High's AND the Low's with amazing clarity AND quality. I can hardly believe how much better I sound while wearing them...but the music is where they truly shine. Crisp, clear and just great audio is what they deliver, and honestly, that's all I really want.<br /><br />Let me point out one other fact that you won't get from a salesman who works at a store that sells 3 dozen different kinds of headphones: I'd say by a margin of 8 to 1, the pair of headphones I see Professional Broadcasters wearing who have been in the biz for at least ten years or more, are Sony's. The new crop of radio people tend to go for the Bass-Powered models more than anything--but those who KNOW, and by that I mean those who've been IN the business of Professional Broadcasting for a decade or more, overwhelmingly wear either the MDR 7506 OR the MDR V6's more than anything else. Honestly, it may even be a wider margin than that. That advice may mean nothing to you, but as I worked my way up the ranks, I always noticed one of the things which tied the guys who had been there longer together was they all seemed to have the same kinds of 'phones. Its nice to tell people you spent a lot on your headphones...but it won't make them sound better than mine for less than half the cost. Experience counts.<br /><br />With that being said, if it is even remotely possible, remember: TRY THEM OUT FIRST before buying. Your head, ears and pocketbook will thank you in more ways then one. Good luck and hope my thoughts help in some, small way.t get from a salesman who works at a store that sells 3 dozen different kinds of headphones: I'd say by a margin of 8 to 1, the pair of headphones I see Professional Broadcasters wearing who have been in the biz for at least ten years or more, are Sony's.

B009AP4MGE|5.0|I coulnt wait for the season to get put on dvd so having the opppurtunity to wstch all the shows this was is amazing. I am so sad by the tragic leaving of Corey, but Finn will live on our hearts.
B00B7ERH04|4.0|I ran out of cam coins which I didn't even realize it came with them and then I could no longer set the camera timer
B000053VAZ|5.0|Before Johnny Depp became the best pirate ever, he was a wonderful character in this movie. He, Aiden Quinn and Mary Stuart Masterson are absolutely charming as 3 characters finding their way through love, loss and discovery. A great, funny, touching movie.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|You have to get through one page to unlock the next page and each page costs more coins which annoyed me so I quit before I got to the rest of the games
B00471TLZS|4.0|I enjoyed this flick when it first came out and couldn't wait to own it.. The VCR copy satisfied my needs but when DVD came out I was compelled to upgrade.. I think it's special effects are timeless and I'm certain others agree. Take on this DVD release from amazon (the best site for movies) and spread the good word.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Knock off game of what I have seen before,I would prefer to see something new and exciting so yea no
B00FEN1C50|4.0|That this movie had such a poor showing at the U.S. box office is a total shame.  I dare anyone to watch the first hour of say any of the Transformer or Fast-and-something-something-Furious films and then the first hour of this flick and tell me they really belong in the same \\"summer blockbuster\\" category.<br /><br />That being said, this is a Guillermo del Toro film and with it comes his blending of drama, mysticism, mythical-demonism and tongue-in-cheek social commentary.  If you loved Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy/Hellboy 2, or Chronos AND you like the anime/Japanese-SciFi humanity vs. BIG monsters genre, then you're going to love this film... and chances are good, even if you don't, you'll get sucked into it anyway.<br /><br />The acting is acceptable for the cast he had to work with... The leads give solid performances, the secondary roles are a bit caricatured at best, but that's also a del Toro signature.  My biggest gripe was that a number of secondary characters looks just like the male lead... to the point that I got confused a few times as to which was which.<br /><br />The special effects are really quite amazing... all the detail and high-octane ballast of a typical Michael Bay Boo(b)m-fest, with none of the empty after taste.  del Toro's use of continuity shoots and live-set/green-screen blending could teach the folks at Skywalker Ranch a thing or two, as well.  He get's really great performances and dynamism in his action sequences by seamlessly blending real action with computer-animation in a way that makes the audience care about what's going on in the scene and not just blind/deafened by it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Structure - The film actually has 3 acts and each one establishes more back-story to the three main characters and the cloud of secondary and minor characters.<br />2) Character-driven - By the end of the film, I genuinely care about all of the characters and the challenges they face entering the final act, rare in a sci-fi action flick.<br />3) Hail to The Geeks - Instead of just making the geeky characters of the story comedic foils or even worse, conduits for deus ex machina, the geeks of this story play a critical part in both the development of the main plot and the enriching of the whole world the story establishes.<br />4) Length - This is a long film... it takes its time building up and then takes its time delivering the final show-down, but it delivers and delivers quite well.<br />5) Romance that doesn't suck - The one romantic thread in the film doesn't devolved into an obligatory sex scene or love-at-first-sight idiocy... it's based on a bond between two people that grows as the story develops and has a solid, mutual basis of existing between them (both characters having survived terrible experiences and still healing from them).<br />6) Creativity - The elements all seem very cliche at first... Big monsters, Big robots, FIGHT!  But the more the story expands the more del Toro's extreme attention to details and unique styling become a center piece to the film... He's oozing with creative genre-bending juice and this film is like an entire fruitbasket of it.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) Pace... This is a long movie and at times I felt like it was having to go out of its way to provide narrative exposition over weaving critical back-plot points into the story development.<br />2) Pace... There are times I was glad I was watching this with a rewind button.  This could be due to del Toro's Spanish-speaking background where rapid-fire dialog, full of sub-context and parallel conversations is a norm (not being racist/culturally insensitive here, just noting the nature of the language and how it's spoken).  While I enjoy this realistic banter, round-robin approach to dialog (think anything Joss Whedon has produced), it can make it hard to keep track of characters and sub-plot.<br /><br />Here's to hoping this flick has a nice long sub-culture existence in years to come!/>3) Hail to The Geeks - Instead of just making the geeky characters of the story comedic foils or even worse, conduits for deus ex machina, the geeks of this story play a critical part in both the development of the main plot and the enriching of the whole world the story establishes.<br />4) Length - This is a long film... it takes its time building up and then takes its time delivering the final show-down, but it delivers and delivers quite well.<br />5) Romance that doesn't suck - The one romantic thread in the film doesn't devolved into an obligatory sex scene or love-at-first-sight idiocy... it's based on a bond between two people that grows as the story develops and has a solid, mutual basis of existing between them (both characters having survived terrible experiences and still healing from them).<br />6) Creativity - The elements all seem very cliche at first...

B00E0MCYPS|1.0|A boys dirt game basically so if you aren't a Tom girl anymore than I suggest not buying it because you will get way too bored with it
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Like so many other aspiring supervillains, I too dreamed of seamlessly uniting my laptop, mobile and living room content on one HDMI-equipped screen. I dreamed big; show off my plans for the Fart Ray to the League of Evil, play that episode of Pokemon that causes seizures for a room full of people and enjoy my collection of Windows 95 screensavers on the big screen.<br /><br />Casting Tabs:<br />Here's the deal: if you want to use Chromecast to 'Cast' Google Chrome tabs to your TV, you're going to need a relatively new wireless router if that means watching Putlocker or other Flash videos. It does, however, perform excellently with static pages.<br /><br />Travel:<br />Chromecast's portability is only useful if you plan on taking the device from one room to another - or if you're going to be taking it to a friend's house - but hotel and public WiFi are out. You'll need a router which supports multicast, which public networks will not, and you can't create an Ad Hoc connection to stream directly from your device to the Chromecast.<br /><br />Desktop Casting:<br />Google stresses that this feature is still very much in the 'BETA' stage. The capitalization is no doubt for emphasis! It's buggy, crashes frequently and is by no means a practical alternative to using a wired connection to bring your PC/Mac desktop into the living room. Keep an eye out for future updates from Google which may make this feature more reliable.<br /><br />Netflix & YouTube Casting:<br />In my testing, Netflix would crash or end up locked in a continuous loading screen when casting from my Samsung Galaxy Tab,  Samsung Galaxy S III and iPod Touch (5th Generation). READ CAREFULLY - When the Chromecast encounters an error of this type, it broadcasts its own SSID (network signal name) and totally disconnects all other devices on your network. You will need to unplug the Chromecast and wait for your devices to reconnect. On the plus side, the Chromecast is totally badass at disrupting the WiFi connection of everything on your network, which is great if your roommate likes to stream Happy Feet really loudly.<br /><br />YouTube, however, works flawlessly. Since the Chromecast doesn't actually stream video from your device directly, you can feel free to take a call, play a game or do whatever you like with your mobile device or computer while YouTube is playing your content.<br /><br />Multiple Devices:<br />Switching between your phone, tablet, iPod or computer is seamless; just cast the content from whatever device you want to use and it will start playing.<br /><br />Be aware that anybody connected to your wireless network can also control the Chromecast - no password, user account or security verification required. If you plan on using the Chromecast in a public place or at a party, don't. Anyone can download the Chromecast app and start streaming Desperate House Husbands 2: The Dickening at your next house party or business conference with the League of Evil.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Small form factor<br />-Still cheaper than descending into a life of supervillainy and crack addiction<br />-Receives updated functionality from Google via updates<br />-Doesn't require your mobile devices to maintain a WiFi connection<br />-The Android and iOS software makes it very easy to cast from inside compatible apps<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Not truly portable<br />-Netflix and YouTube are really the only 'Apps' available; developers are still waiting to see if this catches on<br />-Tab casting video content is buggy; video quality does not adjust automatically<br />-Netflix casting can disconnect all of the devices on your network<br />-Extremely easy for random strangers to 'Cast' porn onto your TV
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|It is just like real inland gives you other people to play with  after a while it stopped working for me
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is fun. It takes a little thinking and tinkering around the room but it is fun. Great for people who like puzzles and mysteries.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|You have to like pile up the goo and reach your goal it reminds me of this cute stacking game I USD to play with birds on torsional long time ago
B00D2CYU2W|3.0|The right movie for the wrong reason.<br />By now we all know Liberace was not only the world's most flamboyant entertainer, he was also a homosexual.  This behind-the-scenes peek at his love life is like a weak cup of luke-warm tea.<br />The main glitch is Michael Douglas' portrayal of Liberace.  He's a straight guy acting like a flaming queen but never quite gets there.  It's hard to ignore his deep, reverberating baritone voice and boney frame; when Liberace had a clear falsetto and a body that fluctuated three clothes sizes at any given time, mostly husky.  The way some of the lines are delivered is really off, and some of the lines miss the point.  In an early scene,  Douglas prances across the stage talking to the audience and says \\"Well go ahead, stare all you like.  I mean, you paid for it!\\".  It sounded like he was talking about tickets to the show.  Liberace himself would tease his audience about how they paid for all his jewelry and costumes, letting them look, touch and marvel at the baubles.  He clearly came across as meaning that his fans made him rich and very comfortable indeed.<br />I think the purpose of this film could have been something extremely touching, delightful and at times, painful to watch.  But it seemed more of an exercise in showing two famous straight actors portraying gay characters in a long term relationship.  Matt Damon pulled it off and had some sterling moments.  I'd pay money to see the outtakes to this film.<br />I had seen this movie on HBO and bought the DVD to see what extras were included.  Hopefully, there would be behind the scenes and biographical information on Liberace.  There is one short extra on the making of the film.  It is mainly the actors telling what it was like to be in the movie.  There was nothing telling about how it felt to connect with their characters.<br />Kudos to Debbie Reynolds as Liberace's mother.  Who would have known if her name wasn't in the credits?  Such an amazing transformation and portrayal.<br />I would have to guess Scott's book gives more intimate graphic details about his relationship with Mr. Showmanship.  The  movie would have done well to take the focus off the actors and their ability to act effeminate, and nurture the authentic trappings and nuances of having a homosexual relationship with a superstar in the 1970's.<br />Could have been better.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|Not to mention a great stress reliever. It is just like the name says. A monkey in a boxing ring who boxes another monkey.
B00BQ1D7BQ|3.0|Maybe it will take some time before this CD is played more by me. So far I am not too impressed.<br /><br />JSM
B005J0VPNC|3.0|Then this camera is for you,it takes your photo and basically turns it into a really nice sketch for you so if you like sketches I would recommend it
0553470485|1.0|I have loved this book since I was a kid and I thank E.B. White for sharing his gift of writing with us but, his read aloud skills are not good! For instance page one reads \\"Do away with it?\\" shrieked Fern. He read this with no shriek, no emotion, no urgency to save the pig, no shock, no disapproval from fern, nothing! He just read the words soft and dull. 3 sentences later you have \\"Don't yell Fern!\\" are you kidding me who was yelling the way he reads this I wouldn't have guessed anyone was upset! LOL The whole audio book was like this!
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I'm sorry but I prefer just getting on the silk app or web and going to mobile YouTube since that actually works
B001VU1NJ0|5.0|This movie was free though Prime Amazon provides a wonderful variety of vidios on demand like this...Great movie. ..loved it!
B00CKKDZ2S|5.0|It makes your day to read these cards whether they be true or not,angels watching everywhere,I do recommend it to all
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Interesting, but not believable to me. It could have been written better, I guess. It just didn't really &#34;get&#34; me.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|As well as the second one it is just like ye . Olde Nintendo games except it is with leprechauns
B0063IH60K|5.0|Can play it when I don't have time to get involved in whatever I'm reading at the time.  Very user friendly.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Release the birds and get those bad pigs that laugh at you knocked down for once and for all instead of throwing things throw birds
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Received early... Amazon is the best (as always). The movie is a great montage of your favorite capes and loud colors  teaming together for a greater good. Really liked the Hulk treatment-nicely done.<br />Recommended.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|If you like super heroes and super-hero movies, this one is for you. The effects are dazzling without being overwhelming and the characters each maintain their distinct personalities. It's fun to watch them grow into a team. And of course there is plenty of mayhem and destruction. This one is a must see.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Received early..everyone knows Amazon rocks (serious).<br />Movie itself is top notch and leaves one with the feeling this could be the epilogue installment to the iconic series-and leaving on top.<br />Recommended.
B00ESY77LO|4.0|I remember reading the book in school and watching the movie brought back fond memories. The story itself is well told and the attention to detail was top-notch. The interplay of modern and 20's style was also very interesting. I'd watch it again, but I don't think I'd buy it.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read!  It's a unique plot, full of both compassion and humor.  I have recommended it to everyone I know and I've read it twice myself.  Markus Zusak is one of the best!
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|I thought the plot was a bit transparent. The story wasn't that compelling. The visual effects were outstanding. I don't think I'll pay for it again, but if it were free I'd watch.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Another book well written. I found the first few chapters a bit dry,but it quickly ramped up to the usual style you are so famous for. I anxiously await the next book in the Prendergast series.
B000QDA7OU|5.0|But totally believable.  The struggles of a young nun to do the medical work she passionately loves, but still follow the strict rules of her order.  Set against the background of the 30s and the beginning of WWII, it is drama at its best.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book from begging to end.  It means even more to finish it only a few days after Mr Clancy`s passing. May he rest in peace.
B003U51D58|5.0|It was nice to watch the whole season in 2 days love it watching with out any interruption, recommend it.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I think this show is fantastic.  I can' get enough of it.  I have purchased all five seasons.  I think the pilot is the greatest and keep rewatching it.
B00E9P959O|5.0|Being a pretty hardcore Rush fan, I bought Vapor Trails when it first came out and have always found it to be one of the most disappointing albums of their library, not just because of the mastering issues, but because it just didn't sound like a Rush album.  It had this harsh, somewhat grungy sound to it that did not seem in their character.<br /><br />I was excited when I heard they planned to remix it, and got on the preorder... I expected a much cleaner version of the previous work, but what I got was an entirely new look at this album.  This is a true remix in that there are parts that have been tonally changed, new parts that weren't in the original, and a completely different sound than the previous.  For example, there's a killer guitar solo in \\"Ceiling Unlimited\\" that wasn't in the previous release.  The clearer sound combined with all the new touches make it so it's like a completely different album now, and I find myself liking it so much more than I did before.<br /><br />Definitely a recommended purchase for all Rush fans.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I got this for my girlfriend as a gift and she loves it.<br /><br />She uses it frequently to stream Netflix movies, play music and watch YouTube videos. She set it up all by herself (I'm the geek not her) and she had no problems, I wasn't even around when she set it up!
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Again, they have made a really GREAT movie.  The characters are true to form and the plot is great.  Couldn't be happier.
1452110581|5.0|I recommend &#34;I Could Pee on This&#34; to anyone who knows and loves cats!  It's intuitive and the pictures are great!r
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This combination of the comic book heroes is great!  Masterfully done so each has his place.  Fun to watch and get lost in.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Heard a lot of negative things about this volume before picking it up, but I don't know why. This has been my favorite in the series so far!!<br /><br />It takes a little bit to pick up in the beginning, but don't give up--this book will not disappoint.
B00C6B9XCW|5.0|One of the more original films I've seen in years. One of my favorites and after it went off regular rotation on HBO I had to own it. This was a great bundle and couldn't be happier.
B000VM9Z8K|5.0|This was the best book I've ever read!  I loved the ending and how they both ended up together! Love it!
1476729085|5.0|This is the most wonderful and original romantic comedy I have read in a long, long time! Don and Rosie are fresh and unique characters on a journey all their own. As soon as I finished it, I started over to experience it again. Can't wait for the sequel. I love love loved this book.
6305428042|5.0|Hands down, this is the BEST Halloween movie. Especially for kids that grew up in the 90s! I'm 22 and still watch it around Halloween time. It's a classic!
B001EBWINQ|5.0|This is one of the great movies of all times. It's fun to revisit this classic from time to time.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I love TED! I'll take it anyway I can get it, and it's great on Silk. I recommend it for everybody
B00F91SCXC|3.0|Well, I love a Zombie flick, but they move so fast you cannot enjoy them.  Plot moves pretty fast too with a few problems.  But satisfying like warm milk, but far from exceptional.
1451695195|5.0|This book has a lot of insight into human being's life itself, not necessarily from a religious perspective, but a different angle that everyone should consider even if you dont believe in after life.<br /><br />The middle part of the book is a bit dragging, but the content towards the end.....so thought provoking...<br /><br />Kudos to the author!
B00E0MCYPS|4.0|I like this app because it is not babies play. It is very challenging, and I confess to changing my steering controls to touch instead of motion. I have made it all the to the backwards levels, and along the way the challenges were very fun. Great game.
B00006EXL5|5.0|This was a gift for someone who wanted to complete a collection of MCR albums.  The disk, CD case and cover art were in perfect condition.
B00EP0KBXM|5.0|Great movie! Will Smith is already a fantastic actor and involving his son with a strong acting role makes this film a winner!
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Have loved every season and waiting for season 5 after Kate and Rick finally got together at the end of season 4 was a long wait.  Now the proposal and we have to wait for the next season.  Bring it on!!
B00F5FEZTC|5.0|This is a very Good Album a Masterpiece by Elton John he's a legend love listening to it! Great Album!
B006O5XYWG|5.0|I have always loved the planet of the apes movies I had every one on VHS but a time came when I had to down grade some of my stuff so I got rid of my VHS movie collection (over 200! And c'mon who keeps VHS anymore) for the smaller space saving DVD and blu ray so I'm in the process of re-buying all of the movies that I love (Godzilla to) I had heard a lot about this ape movie but was skeptical I didn't think it would fit into the ape universe as I am a purist, I can now say that I am very glad I decided to restart my ape movie collection with this one, first off it is very well written you get to see ceaser evolve from an infant (the leader of the apes and the reason for all of the ape movies) and you care about him and his plight, and it all makes sense you understand why he leads his people away from humans (this is a jump off because in the original series of movies the apes enslave the humans) the way this movie was filmed is fantastic you will totally believe this could happen (not like the God awful remake with Donny Whalburg) the blue ray sound and picture are excellent good special features (could have been more) all around excellent movie and for the life of me I do not understand why they (the film makers and studios) didn't use this movie to restart a new series of movies it's that good!! so do your self a favor and get this the whole family can watch AGAIN EXCELLENT MOVIE YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY THAT YOU DID!!!
B005MVLI8A|5.0|This is one of the Best Rock Albums I have ever heard it's definitely good you should give it a try won't dissapoint.

B008IJTFYW|4.0|Great App for stressful days.  Like it for meditation or just to calm me down a bit after a busy day.  You just need to find the ones that fit &#34;You&#34; .
B008602KQI|4.0|Loved the books and was so pleased to see that this movie follows the book rather well.  Not perfect but well.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|I sat down to watch this program with my grandson and thought I just liked the idea of us being together but it turned out I laughed more than he did. I did a second showing for the rest of my grandkids and laughed just as hard. This was a great family movie!!!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|What a good book, the best ive read since 11/22/63. If i cant put the story down and enjoy the ending, it gets 5 stars from me.<br /><br />I see this as a bit of a graduated more sophisticated writing than some other works previously written, and as i have read most all Mr. Kings books, it fit my also older and graduated reading preferences.<br /><br />Recommended to all readers, young and older. One note: it is not as dark as some previous works. To this day The Stand will forever be my favorite of all books i have ever read, I state this only to commend this authors undeniable talent to keep me engaged in his stories. Doctor Sleep is no exception.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We adore this show and wish we didn't have to wait for the season premiere in January to get more!
0380977273|5.0|I hadn't read this book since being in college and it was a real treat to go back to this classic story of two boys and a dark carnival...even better is the story on how he came about writing it...
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book is a real treat for historical fiction fans. Well developed characters, heart-wrenching accounts of children's lives and the sometimes sad, sometimes triumphant outcomes make for a fantastic read.
B004132I20|4.0|great show and acting --- wish it was a bit less expensive and had more extras .  i may just watch or stream instead for the next seasons since the value in the purchase is limited
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|This book tries too hard to be everything. As i read it I keep thinking of Harry Potter and of the Twilight saga.  Unfortunately although it borrows elements from these stories it lacks the attention to detail they have.  It lacks description, narrative, meaning. Situations deveop too fast with not enough story to support them.  This book is a little too predictable. Enjoy it it as one would enjoy ordering in; it does the job but not completely
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I really like the graphics and creating different items to solve puzzles. The hints were helpful when I was in a bind and the music was cheerful.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|This is the start of a series, so fare it is funny interesting and reminds me of the Harry Dresden novels. I can't wait to start the next book.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Here I enjoyed the story and the character s.BUT those four letters words weren't needed to get the story line through.  I know, I know same old complaint but if only the author s would listen.  You don't need to swear to get us to buy you books.
0451232852|4.0|This is an extremely well-researched book and while the various threads of the novel are woven together expertly, I found it difficult to follow so many different threads.  The primary character in this monumental story is actually the war itself.  It's intriguing to see both sides of the struggle, but frustrating to become involved with one leg of the story, then taken to another.  I have to keep thinking, &#34; Now what was going on with this character ?&#34;. I have already purchased the second book in the series, so clearly I am intrigued and  invested in the saga.  I think Follet is one of our finest writers, but I have to admit to frustration with the scope of this story.
B002SHD9E2|5.0|Amazing movie! If you haven't seen any of the takes on Phantom.,. This is definitely it! Best one ever by far!
1401937268|5.0|I have bought different tarots and this deck is perfect for working with angels, in the past I tried other ones that supposed to be working with the angelic realm but they have harsh energy and weren't that peaceful as this ones.<br />I found this item really useful, also I work with them as a tarot reader for living.
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|I absolutely loved it. I have become so bored with American TV. It kept me guessing all the way through. As an avid mystery reader I am usually pretty good at figuring out the plot, this ending was a big surprise.<br />Penelope Haskell
B00D6QUMWG|5.0|bravo! I loved the album, Anna has done a great job with the awesome orchestra! Bravo, Anna~ one of the greatest voice!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is so beautiful. Its a classic love story, with a twist on love and loss. Perfect for teens. Only problem is.....you will fall in love with the characters and won't be able to define the line between them and real people. Despite this, it is a must read! Please do buy TFIOS. It will be worth your while.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|Great writing, clever dialogue, interesting characters. Great acting. It was intelligent , well thought out and had an emotional rhythm that satisfied.
0345548981|5.0|Novak is funny and authentic. I already eat a paleo diet and his advices are helping me keeping my life choices.
B00EK0UBPU|4.0|The ending was disappointing.  Too many unanswered questions.  Up to that point I thought it was very good.  Not a Booker Prize winner because of that in my mind.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|If you are the guy who loves geek culture, this book is a must buy! The novel keeps you hooked!
B001NLKSI4|5.0|I cant put the book down!  Jordon knows how to tell a good story!  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes true stories.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|The author does not, in my view, provide enough information on his after-life or NDE experience. For every page about it there must be another 15 pages of autobiographical info, most of which is irrelevant to the theme of the book. Surely he could have described his NDE experiences, that did after all last almost a week, in more detail?
B00CWEQ62S|5.0|I enjoyed it more then I did the book, the graphics really held my interest in the book. It's  as well drawn as it was written.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Possibly the best show Joss Wheaton has ever created.. Its a shame its only 13 episodes (FOX what were you thinking!)
B006RXPY3C|5.0|WE really enjoyed it very much.  Very interesting. Would recommend it to anyone wanting to see behind the scenes real things that go on in leadership.  Not always easy decisions.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Really puts Jesus in a historical time and place, so you can see how he fits in. Helps you understand the political environment at the time, plus the motivations of the later gospel writers.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|We love the style of the old classic musicals, the sense of make-believe and especially Dick Van Dyke. A Good choice.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|So very awesome! I loved it and can't wait for all the rest of the movies to be out! MARVEL/DISNEY ROCKS!!!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I really love this series and it's definitely worth owning. I like that with Amazon's video library I can watch it from anywhere. Of course, the only downside is that there is only one season of Firefly--a huge judgement error on the part of the network. But...such is life and we have Amazon to thank for making it available here.
B00FEN000S|5.0|So awesome!!! Worth every penny and I keep watching it over and over again!! I hope there will be many more movies like this!!!
B001VU1NJ0|2.0|I realize the movie was rated&#34;R&#34;, but it was way over the top with bad words, especially the &#34;F&#34; bomb.  I watched it because I enjoy movies in that era (60's).  It was a little slow at times, but still it kept me on the edge of my seat.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Couldn't wait to watch this each night.  It's one of those calming series of shows.  No nasty language, no violence, no lewd scenes.<br />On to Season 2!!!
B00BKTFABE|5.0|This free download covers the basic needs of anyone wanting a product designed for this purpose.  It's a 2 step download - (And we love 2-step in Texas!) and once opened the directions for use are easy to follow and the product is a breeze to use.  Made things  easy, which I appreciate at my age.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I thought the story was compelling, but I couldn't make myself like the main character as a person.  Too many differences in the way we think, especially about personal behavior.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I started playing Restaurant Story several months ago. When I could get extra stuff by playing Restaurant Story, too, I thought, &#34;what the heck!&#34;  Now I've got both up and running and play them equally and mostly simultaneously!  I love my neighbors and all the goals you have to achieve.  I just really like this game!
B0089LOG02|5.0|I learned a great deal about this era in our country's history from this book.  I had no idea there were so many of these orphan children involved.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Not the best but a nice change from the story line seek and finds. I was asked to rate very early in game for a quest and I'm nit too sure of my opinion on its. Like I said it's different, so far it's okay.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I just can't believe it's over... everything felt extremely rushed and the ending just left me feeling broken-hearted.  Sookie finally picks a man but it's just not believable.  We as readers always knew how Sookie was feeling and I felt blindsided by her choice.  I really enjoyed this series but I'm sad it had to end this way.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|This is a great cd,  I originally bought it just for &#34;Harvest Moon', but the more I listen to the whole cd, the more I love it, it brings back some great memories, (and some sad ones when I listen to Ohio)
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|It's a fun game , and keeps the granddaughters occupied for long periods of time.<br />It's also easy enough for me to play :)
140006922X|4.0|This book gives the reader an eye openning view of the region. A fast read but leaves you wondering what life was really like in those times.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|Don't listen to other false reviews about this movie. Word war Z is an awesome zombie flick with plenty of action and a story to follow. t's a must see for zombie fans! Rent this and you won't be disappointed!
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Cant explain how amazing this Season is.<br /><br />If you didnt see it yet....GO on buy and WATCH it!<br /><br />Cant wait for tomorrow to see what happens in Season 9 =D
B009WUBERW|5.0|great action movie and the acting was superb.  Movie was over before we knew it.  The whole family loved it.
B00CATSONE|5.0|A quick detailed look at the life of Nikola Tesla and other inventors/geniuses. A must read for anyone.  I highly recommend it
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Great movie, I didn't think it would be as good as it was.  We were on the edge of our seats the whole time.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|good game for time killing worth buying if u have a little time to kill here and there fun time
B0090SI42Y|3.0|There was too much action in this movie, it was like watching a circus performance.  We didn't finish watching it.  Our kids loved it.
6305428050|5.0|This very funny from start to end. The cast are perfect for the film & add much to each scene.
B009LDCZDC|5.0|The suspense is good, the acting is superb.  This is one of the best series on TV at this time.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I enjoy playing this game. The only problem I have with this game is it gets boring after a few weeks
B00E0MCYPS|3.0|well this app is good to keep my kids occupied so it works good for that to much for me as am not a gamer put it on my kindle fire graphics seem ok like i said it keeps the kids happy and thats good !
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|These tracks are amazing!! Some of best music I've heard in years. I will buy any music that she puts out!!!
B00F2P8ZDC|5.0|This is my favorite movie. The HD restoration was wonderful. So happy to have this in HD digital to enjoy.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is the best written, charming and entertaining television  I have watched in years.I  cannot wait for Season 4. Maggie Smith is priceless.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|Hey that was good I think after this I'm going to read all the books over again I loved  I think it was awesome
B0033H7VI6|2.0|great looking knife and very durable but the handle is way to big and im a big guy (6'4\\"). This knife would be perfect if it fit in your hand better and fit is everything when controlling a knife.
B002JXK5VU|4.0|Excellent show proper amount of humor and drama. Seems tobe a good repiour among the actors & actresses. Very enjoyable.
B0082FPIY8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was heartbreakingly sad at times though. The description of the long walk she did across the PCT made me want to embark on a similar journey of my own!
B00FEN000S|5.0|One of the most fun and entertaining movies to ever have been made. Guillermo Del Toro did an amazing job in capturing the essence of human struggle and survival while balancing it with determination and humility.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Obviously you cant make a cohesive movie out of this book...but a little more thought into the basic premise of the story would have been nice. The movie had a few parts that made you jump, but other than that I would suggest you watch &#34;28 Days Later&#34;.
1885167776|5.0|A first rate book that identifies strategies to help focus on important goals rather then &#34;to do&#34; lists and dismiss' popular beliefs about multitasking and balancing our lives among other things
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|For those who read Stephen King, this story will take you back and have you pegging your brain for those little details that are to die for in his novels (is he really a Sox fan? I can't be sure....). This story takes place in the life of Danny Torrance, one of three survivors (two, if you saw the movie) from The Shining. My recommendation? Cliff note or reread the Shining before heading down this path. It's expected of you as a Stephen King aficionado.<br />I read this in two days. Only King can scare you into fearing old people in RVs, and I promise, you will not be disappointed with how our Danny spent his life after The Overlook.<br />Take a step back into his world and bask in all the reasons The Shining scared you, and watch life, which is like a wheel, come full circle.<br /><br />Xoxo,<br />Aunt Rachel
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I don't fully understand the game but I am enjoying it.  wish I understood it more but that may come in time.  It is fun and that is what a game should be.
B00E1LAS42|2.0|The movie was entertaining a bit, but extremely too long and I believe missed the main point of the book - which was the gap from rich to poor, and the outlandish exuhberence of the filthy rich.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Such a great start to such an amazing series. I've recommended this book to so many people that I've lost count. This book doesn't shy away from the fact that the future looks very bleak indeed. It is well written and the characters are very well drawn out.
B00EMJBVAI|5.0|Book was much better.  MUCH BETTER!  Movie was still very entertaining for a Zombie movie, but it let so much out and the complete style of the book was lost.  Such a shame.  All the same, I enjoyed the film for the entertainment and the Zombies were better and more realistic.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|I still love this writing, but this book can get confusing as times. I do recommend reading the books before seeing the TV show. The books just offer such a rich complexity that it is hard to put down! The TV show will give you some clarity though since things can get confusing at times, especially since the cast of characters is so large!
B00DFFHUUA|4.0|It was entertaining, but the first film was much better.  Acting was also better in the first film.  Still, worth a watch.
B004J4WKDI|3.0|I had high expectations for this book since it came highly recommended to me. While it was a great read, the characters were interesting, the storyline drew you in.... I couldn't tell you a single thing about the actual plot really... I pretty much forgot about the book as soon as I read it. A book should leave you with a lasting impression, and this didn't. I thought I would be thinking about this book for days... and I didn't.
B005ZMUQCK|5.0|Animated cars racing around....?  Who would not love it?  Adorable characters and plot.  Adult and children alike enjoy this.  If you haven't seen it yet.... where have you been hiding?
B003YL4LYI|4.0|There was a huge gap between book 4 and book 5, so this was something I was really looking forward to. Book 4 and book 5 take place during the same time period, but one has half the characters and the other has the other half of the characters. I have to say, it is getting a bit boring and starting to feel a bit dragged out. Yes there were exciting cliff hangers... but I want things to move faster!
B00A7I6MCU|5.0|This is the best remake of King Kong I have encountered.  It mixes in everything from humor, great acting, great computer graphics and even prehistoric beasts.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love the arena in this book more so than the first book. Everything was so cleverly drawn out and written. It sets it up well for the third and final book. There was a lot of death in the first book, but in this book it feels even closer to home since Katniss has formed deeper bonds with people. She'll piss you off, but that is who she is.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|The new Star Trek movies keep getting better.  Keep making them...  I will keep buying them!  Better than the first, in the Trek style.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This one is my favourite in the series. This book had me on the edge of my seat the whole time, more so than the other 4 books.
B00F0AI9Y4|5.0|This is one of my new favorite bands.  Great blend of music keeps this band rocking when you need it, and mellow when you need a slow-down.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I'll be honest, I had high expectations for this book; it being her first novel outside of the HP series. She is a fantastic writer and the writing was definitely not lacking. However, I didn't love the storyline and I really didn't like the ending. So, overall, it was an okay book, but not great. If your a JK fan I'd say go for it and read it, but don't expect it to be anything like HP!
B00FEN000S|4.0|VERY LONG movie about giant robots and giant monsters.  Constant action, so-so acting, I enjoy watching it on rainy days!
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|Shiver is such an amazing writer; you feel sorry for the 'bad' guy, and that isn't always easy to do! I haven't seen the movie yet, but I'm sure it's great as well. This book doesn't have as much suspense as you think it would, but it has got fantastic surprises that will leave you with your jaw on the ground!
B00DP3IESY|2.0|Had an interesting plot, but was over acted and several of the scenes were too long.  It was entertaining, but I could have done a one time rental and been happy with never watching it again.  I did pick up a one-liner from the movie that I use out with friends...  &#34;Are you still an effective team?&#34;
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|I got this for my Mom as a Christmas gift! I ended up getting it on sale, so I was very happy with the price. All the discs were intact and they all play very well. Great present for the New Girl lovers in your life!
B007HOOAH6|5.0|My son loves this book.  He laughs the entire time we read it. He has even started to quote it when he needs to go potty.  For us, it is a potty training must.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Why must this only have half the characters? I get it, it would have been way too long, but it makes things feel a bit disconnected, in my opinion! Overall, still a great series! And still a great book... stick with it!
B005544V6A|5.0|What I love about Suits:  I like that it follows only a few main characters lives, and it revolves around Mike's secret. I'm not having to follow 10 different people's stories (old LA Law) and I feel like the series goes somewhere significantly after each episode. (unlike something like Game of Thrones where I am dying for the story to move faster, and for the story I like best to be featured in more detail).<br />I like that it's about the people in the law office, and not the courtroom as much. I have enough crime dramas to watch already!  I like that some case is usually resolved each week...(How could a law office survive if that didn't happen?)<br /><br />Most of all I like that Mike seems to be growing as a person.  And that it shows how his relationships affect him, and how he affects the people he works with.  Good writing!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I tried to go through this book slowly as possible, knowing there would be nothing after this to look forward to. I failed miserably. I could not put this book down and I finished it in one day! Harder deaths to deal with are rampant in this book, and it feels like Katniss has finally matured. More so than the other two books I felt that Katniss didn't shy away from becoming an adult (expect for certain spots). Collins has managed to masterfully complete her series. I honestly hope she decides to continue the series somehow.. many in a distant future?
B000005RQT|5.0|I loved it when I was young, and it is still great. The music has a good feel, and gives me a quick trip back to younger days. This is one of the iconic albums of my youth.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|This movie is fantastic! As a firm believer that book to movie adaptations should reflect each other... I was happy to see that the author of the book also directed the movie. It is as good as the book was and also is able to stand on its own without having someone have to know the book. It sheds light on some serious issues, but has a good sense of humor as well. I also love that it comes from a simpler time.. the early 90's... before the internet was big. I'd say it is like the Breakfast Club for a new generation. It was delivered promptly and in great condition!
0345803485|1.0|I so badly wanted to enjoy the trilogy set. I had to find out for myself what all the hype was about. So, the first \\"fifty shades of grey\\" was just adequate in the first few chapters. It got sickening after the constant annoying repeated dialogues between the two (emails). Mr. Grey this, ms. Stelle that. Christian's overbearing insecurities and his need to control Ana just made me want to toss the book. After taking a few days off, my curiosity got the best of me so I continued.<br /><br />It's hard to even describe Ana as interesting or even intelligent.  She's deflowered by Christian yet tries to put on this act as if she's experienced, perhaps to impress christian??<br /><br />OMG also, I can't tell you how many times she refers to her \\"inner goddess\\", her \\"sex\\", her \\"subconscious\\" this and that.<br />His jeans lowered to his hip, his just \\"f&$!?@\\" hair.<br />By the middle of the book, as a reader, I think we all realize that precious Ana bites her damn lower lip to tease and taunt her \\"fifty shades\\"<br />and also, Christian tilts his head to one side.<br /><br />She's so naive! Even as a prepubescent I had more sense than this broad!<br /><br />I was so disappointed. I even tried the other two and honestly, the writing got worse. I even skimmed through chapters hoping for some excitement. The characterization was so predictable and just plain boring!<br /><br />Very disappointed, putting it mildly. Perhaps the movie might bring more to the characters? I'll wait for Netflix!
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|There could be no God.  Oooh... I don't even like to type that.  It seems kind of scary and depressing.  I still feel that there is more going on here than just Darwin's evolution.  There is no refuting Darwin, but there just has to be more to it all.  Life feels like a gift. I feel like thanking someone.  The world didn't have to be so amazing and beautiful just for creatures to survive.  But, no question, I have to go with Richard on if God exists, it is most certainly not the judging, personal, prayer answering, man in the sky guy.  Although, if I were to hedge my bets, I would say praying for others, as opposed to for oneself, might be worth the tiny little investment it takes.  I certainly don't have any scientific evidence, but I feel like there might be something to the power of affirmations. But hey, whatever gets me through the night, is all right as long as I'm not shoving it down your throat, right?  Maybe we're all part of the fabric of God.  I don't really know what that means, but it sounds good.  Who knows?  I don't expect we'll be proving that either way.  Certainly not in my lifetime.  I'm guessing we will continue to peel the scientific onion (and should!) forever and still never be able to definitively answer &#34;What is God?&#34;. I accept that we, as humans, must ponder that question forever.  So thank you, Richard, for lending your eloquence to a point of view that really needs to be heard now.  We need to be able to fight religious fundamentalism, which in the best case is extremely annoying and worst case is probably the greatest threat to our existence on the planet. As humans, we're at a very interesting point in history where Darwin's natural selection evolution is starting to lose its effect.  Medical technology is insuring that just about everybody survives long enough to reproduce now, and less educated populations, where religious fundamentalism tends to thrive, are the most prolific.  We can only hope that as radical religious fundamentalists gain technology, they become more educated and more capable of rejecting the dogma and other &#34;designed to control&#34; oppressive, characteristics of their religions.  It needs to be REALLY OK to be a non-religious person in the world.  We're not there yet here in the states.  Anyway..., God or no God, we'll never know, but religion has nothing to do with it.  It was a truly thought provoking read.  Thanks Richard Dawkins, for helping to pave the way for free thought!
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Amazing book! Really life changing!<br />It has some very interesting facts & ideas. The way the book is organised makes a lot of sense into getting everything you read about together for a useful lesson that you can apply in your daily life.<br />I highly recommending this book, some parts will feel a bit slow & dry, but overall it's quite an interesting read!
B00DIJQAI6|5.0|Sarah likes this game.  Its very sonicy and she likes Tails and Dr Eggman and Sonic. And she will never forget about it.
B0057UA4FY|5.0|I'm a Star Wars fanatic, as is the rest of my family. We all love The Clone Wars, even though they don't have the same quality as the movies. Quality packaging and no problems or glitches. The bonus content is great too.
0060920084|1.0|So unlike his other books.  The Lost Continent seems written by a man who has such low self-esteem that he has to cut down everything around him.  He is clearly trying to let us know how much better he is than anyone or anywhere else.  He tries at humor, but it is just a dismal, depressing, mean-spirited, not to mention, boring and poorly written accumulation of complaints and misinformation.  I quit it three times before finally giving up on it for good about half way through.  A waste of money and time.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Works great. Easy to to go from place to place. The lighting is good for reading at night without disturbing everyone else.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|For the price and sound quality - this is a great mixer! Suits me for home studio use and provides lots of control.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|What an amazing read, I couldn't put the book down. It is dark, mysterious, enchanting, timeless.  Read this book, it is magical! You will want to run away and join the circus:
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Another good book to capture my interest and keep it! Have read many of his books and this is a good one.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|Robert Downey Jr. and Gweneth Paltrow are favorite actors of mine. Unlike Downey's Sherlock Holmes who is a more complex character, this movie is predictable, after all it is a comic  book, but the actors and CGI make it an enjoyable escape.
B00DH4BL4U|5.0|For the people upset about Zlatan being pretentious/self-absorbed--do you all know NOTHING about soccer? Nothing about Zlatan? The first thing anyone would know about Zlatan is that he is absolutely insane, completely narcissistic, and somehow, still brilliant. Why did you purchase/read this book?<br /><br />I am from Malm&ouml; and Zlatan got started at my hometown club. I have essentially worshiped him my entire life, and perhaps that connection is what resonated with me. I actually cried a little when he spoke about his return to Malm&ouml;/Rosengård. It was nice to see he does have some appreciation for how he is idolized by his fans, some acknowledgement.<br /><br />Yeah, the translation is bad, I would like to read it in Swedish instead. But this is such a unique glimpse into his mind. I absolutely loved the book and would recommend it to everyone who cares about soccer who won't be offended by his arrogance, as many of the reviewers apparently were...
B00FJTYDKK|3.0|The Croods are a cave dwelling clan of Neanderthals led by conservative patriarch Grubb (voice of Nicholas Cage). One day their routine is disrupted by the appearance of a Cromagnon stranger who brings fire and foretells that their world is about to end.  The movie is about their adventures trying to find a safe place to live and the slow evolution of Grubb's thinking about change as a good thing.  Animation and color is great.
B00005JOHC|4.0|When Charlie was on the show it was better then what they got on now. Now they are pulling straws out for ideas for this show now.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Zombies to the front of us, zombies to the back of us. As George Custer might have said, &#34;Holy Cow, look at all those damned Zombies.&#34;  The nice wrinkle was that these zombies could haul ass, making them much more threatening and dangerous.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I had  a previous experience with the Chromecast that was not favorable and had returned the product. However,after discovering that I had  a Wi FI issue with my ISP and resolving that,I retried it and it works exactly as advertised. Still not as versatile as I would like(just Netflix and YouTube) and the iPad controls are are still a bit tricky it's a good value for $34.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|Where do retired musical artists go in the U.K.? The powerhouse cast including Maggie Smith, Billy Connelly, and Tom Courtnay struggle to adjust their comfortable retirement when Diva Maggie Smith shows up.  Directed by Dustin Hoffman, this film is worth watching.
B000ICXQXI|5.0|Great story, amazing actors and of course the Hitchcock directing! I could not even watch new version of this movie seemed so fake.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Lindsey's music is great for the gym to keep the energy level up. Also great when sitting at work doing those mundane tasks that have to be done but have a tendency to put you to sleep.
B00F35BV64|5.0|As an original TREKY all I can say is GREAT.<br />William should by proud.<br />The first one was OK but this one is creepy good!
B005DOKIYG|4.0|I really like this zip sleeve.  It fits the Kindle Fire perfectly and protects it as I carry it to many different places.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I can not wait to read the next book. Captivating story and well written.  You will enjoy the book series.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use and very handy.  Great free app.  Highly recommend!  I use the calculator almost every day.  Awesome app.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|The Harry Potter for adults! I only wish I'd gotten the five book bundle but I didn't realize I hadn't until it was too late!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Love all of his books. This is no exception. Found story interesting and entertaining as well. reading this book is like drinking cool spring water. It flows very well.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|Excellent, well written, well executed, and well acted film.  A high school story that is entertaining what ever the crowd.
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|a chick book--was looking for more story. Got more emotion. Story did move quickly and at times too quickly. Not my kind of book
B004L3AR0K|5.0|I love this movie simply because it's honest.  The fear both parties exhibit are true, raw, and realistic. Yes, the ending might be ..well hollywood, but this movie faces the question of cowardice in a relationship, or lack there of.  A good watch, for males and females.
B005DI9906|5.0|I have watched 4 remakes of Four Feathers- the 1939 version is my favorite--however I do plan to rewatch the other versions in the near future
1449437524|5.0|I have the poster of this already but this was the perfect gift for the dog owners in my life - the older ones who would never put a poster of this on their wall.  Inman is amazing - humble, sweet, honest, and hilarious.  He voices all our inner, crazy thoughts in a way thats socially acceptable.  Well done.
B0041VV03A|4.0|this is a good movie.  a beautiful young woman turns into a monster.  you will start feeling sorry for  her because in the movie she is hidden and not allow to socialize. she very unhappy.  after she change to the monster, that feeling is gone.  watch the movie.
1449410243|5.0|Matthew Inman is at it again.  Perfect gift for older teens, or anyone with a sense of humor.  I love to leave it on the coffee table and watch peoples reactions.
B00E688KA4|5.0|Ive been waiting for this album for too long now. the thing i love about Tyr is i always enjoy the album more upon my third or fourth listen. They're a band that has never put out a bad album and every album they put it is close to flawless, everyone will have there complaints but this album was good step up from The Lay of Thrym and its been on repeat since i picked it up. Great artwork too i think this is my favorite album artwork they have ever put out! Cheers!
B00E7SFAAG|4.0|Got this for my Son to play and he  enjoys it.  As for me? I like it too.  Pretty great.

B00E8B1P9M|1.0|Story is not compelling, the action was over the top for no reasons. I simply could not finish to watch it.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|These stories keep getting better and better.  All of the characters are developing, and their stories are beginning to come together.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very handy, very good appearance. When I open this app in front of people, I feel I'm about to calculate something important.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love the game. It's fun. I love how it's challenging and its interesting. No glitches and its perfect on the go when I'm traveling
B00915G6SU|5.0|This season had an added bonus of having the Replicator story tie in to almost every episode.  Especially loved Dr. Reid's story line, but this season went a little deeper into most of the cast's personal lives.  They had some good behind the scenes stuff on profiling - Peter Pan Syndrome is the only one I can remember at the moment, but there were more.  Also, they did a round table with all the writers, with A.J. Cook and Kristen Vangsness (J.J. & Garcia) asking the questions.  Hilarious and informative.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|Great story. Didn't like the contemporary music for a film depicted in the 1920s acting was good. Sets and locations were awesome.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Started off a little slow, but after 1st couple episodes was back in the flow.  I love the behind the scenes stuff they always have - especially the directors' comments - whether it be commentary or a special feature on directing.  My favorite part is always the gag reel, and this one didn't disappoint.
B001OQCV6K|4.0|I must say that I  was disappointed in the movie as a whole but enough people here have already provided their opinions on the film, acting, literary relevance etc so my review and rating is strictly for the actual video and audio transfer of the film to Blu Ray and has nothing to do with the movie itself.<br /><br />VIDEO......<br />  The video is perfectly clean and free of grain and any artifacts.  Of course, with this much CGI being used in the film, grain would not occur in the first place.  Contrast is excellent and the usually cooler color temperature grading of the film during many of the action sequences adds to the film's ambience.  Details are quite easy to see even in the darker, more shadowy areas despite the fact that the editors crushed the blacks in many places.  You really can't have a cleaner transfer than what you are getting here despite a fairly low Mbps average usually in the low twenties.<br /><br />AUDIO....<br />  Audio has always been as important to me as the video quality and I know that is not the case for everyone.  The audio is a lossless DTS HD MA 5.1 codec.  I wish it were a 7.1 channeled surround but it isn't.  There is an early scene when Watson is walking into Holme's office which is full of birds and other animals masked by all the foliage.  During this scene there is fantastic use of bird foley fx that make the most of discreet directionality from your front and rear surrounds.  For the rest of the film the music score of the film is nicely spread around the front and rear sound stages and the many explosions and pounding foley fx  are also spread across both stages.  However, this spread seemed to lack the discreet directionality and the same audio sounded to me as if it were coming from both sides of the rear stage.  This is not to say that there isn't any discreet use of the surrounds, there certainly is, but for the action and movement in the video, directionality often seemed lacking.  Your LFE channel gets a great workout and there really was some very deep bottom end in many parts of the film.  Dialogue is clearly transparent and easy to understand as well as being properly balanced with the score and foley fx.<br /><br />EXTRAS....<br />  I love it when there are deleted scenes or outtakes but this Blu Ray didn't have any.  It did come with a  Standard Def version of the film to download into your computer for watching on an iPad and that is always a cool thing, but I don't think I really would want this film on my iPad.  Never the less, it is certainly better than having to rely upon the crappy Ultraviolet which gives you serial numbers that expire after a time.  Other extras include BD Live....does anyone actually use this?  A doc called 'Inside the mind of Sherlock Holmes, Storyboards and a Stills library.  There is a rather unique extra in that you can watch the film with Robert Downy Jr. occasionally interrupting to point out how a scene was made or providing other juicy tidbits regarding the film.<br /><br />Overall, the transfer of both video and audio are as good as they will ever produce this film.  All my reviews focus solely upon the actual quality of the Blu Ray rather than giving a 600th summary of the plot.<br />I do hope that this review has been of some HELP to you in determining your purchase and that my other reviews will be of equal assistance.<br />Thanks for reading.and there really was some very deep bottom end in many parts of the film.

B009H7SCMA|5.0|Author Alan Hardy is a master at teasing and titillating you so you will be as helpless as one of Gabriella's admirers. Just as Gabriella's admirers are unable to turn away from her, you will be unable to stop turning pages in this wonderful erotic comedy. The main character Gabriella is beyond gorgeous and sexy. Everything about her exudes seductiveness; so much so that men and sometimes women who are even near Gabriella are reduced to weak and obsequious servants.<br /><br />Gabriella knows she has this power over men and women. She gets whatever she wants, whenever she wants it. All she has to do is wiggle her bottom or lick her lips and she can get anyone to do anything. Big tough men are like jello and at her beck and call. She is also rich and part of the upper class and sees no reason to be nice to anyone. She is self-absorbed and mean to everyone. She simply says, \\"do this,\\" or \\"do that,\\" and it happens. Even when she is mean and insulting to people, they still worship her and grovel at her feet.<br /><br />Gabriella is a rich aristocrat and looks down on working class people. So what happens when she develops an uncontrollable attraction to the working class opponent who is trying to defeat her in a friendly (or not so friendly) game of cricket? As the attraction turns to passion, and passion turns to love, will we see somewhere beneath Gabriella's cruel exterior, a tender, loving heart. You will need to read this wonderful adult story to see for yourself.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|Great follow up to the Iron Man series. Hope Hollywood continues to build on this theme. Great action and realistic plotline.
B0031RS7MW|4.0|I had seen the film years ago, but it lacked the depth and dark side of the book. I found the references to cooking and witchcraft fascinating and she reflected at least some of my own experiences, I am looking forward to discovering the Gers region for myself
034580404X|5.0|Great read if you like this type of book. The writer did a fabulous job of connecting all three books as if they were one. I would love to read more books like this. Although I know it won't do it justice, I can't wait for the movie! Anymore books like this out there?
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Really enjoyed this installation of the Iron Man series.  Robert Downey Jr. is the best in this role.  I also LOVED Ben Kingsley's roll.  Terrific move overall!
B000I0XLYO|1.0|This was one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. It has the worst performances of so many famous actors all bundled into one<br />horrible movie. Not funny at all.
B008D36INE|2.0|The acting is quite good, but the film is very slow moving, with some violence.  I did not enjoy the film and sped through most of the last third of it.
B008D28HYS|3.0|Interesting game.  Definately takes a bit to get the hang of it. It kind of sucks you in if you adre anything like me and I spent an hour playing it. I do like it.
B001P7HUF0|5.0|Who doesn't love a underdog wins the whole deal story??  Characters are well acted but are not going to know your socks off.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|Have fun hitting mutant run them over go fast continue till you are stoped just have fun doing that is what this game is all about just have fun hitting zombies
0374533555|4.0|Very interesting read but somewhat dry. Not so easy to get through. The examples are helpful but wish it were a little more of a breeze.
B005NS0VNU|4.0|so much more could of been included especially from the older music or some live stuff. but it will do.
B000HKYNQ0|5.0|I could watch over and over.  it never gets old.  i love it.<br />the story lines are always interesting.  GREAT
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Better than I expected. Could have been better with more action maybe. Do not need to watch it again. uh
B005HEFB6M|5.0|I could watch over and over.  it never gets old.  i love it.<br />the story lines are always interesting.  GREAT!<br />I have purchased the dvd's
B008HK3XYK|4.0|It's a good case. Well constructed, even though it's from china. It met my reasonably high expectations. If you want or need a case I would recommend it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love this series, Would recommend to friends and family. Quick easy read. Great to pick up and read when waiting in line or at appointments.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|Season one of breaking bad got me hooked.  It took one month of my life as I couldn't stop watching each episode.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I Love all of these books, Easy to read on kindle or phone while waiting in line at grocery store, at dr office etc. Must READ!
0738711500|5.0|The graphics are beautiful!! I loved them so much this is the 3rd set I am buying to keep as a back up in case they can't be found later. However, I did find the book a bit lacking, but I only bought this set for the graphics anyway.
B009PMEEY2|1.0|I got this game for free (app of the day) if I had paid for it, I would have kicked my dog. It needs updating BIGTIME, it crashes, and then crashes, and crashes again. Please do something abpit this. The game is awesome, why do you think I keep going through the crashes.......so please free me from this vicious cycle of euphoria and complete devastation. Fix this.
B00AX6KNOY|5.0|If you like The Thing and Invasion of the Body Snatchers, you should really like this too. A late 90's gem.
B002ECN4P0|4.0|I like most of the songs on the CD and is definitely a good buy.  I love Wild Horses and most of the songs bring back good memories.
B00FEHXISA|3.0|Action is mediocore, not worth $5.99 on amazon , earlier versions were much better, glad it is the last one.
0374533555|4.0|I liked this book--counterintuitive, explains difficult concepts to a lay audience, generally well written.  I did find it long-winded and heavy going at times--not a real page turner, unlike Freakenomics--but still engaging and worth the effort.<br /><br />This book is great a source of discussion with others who are reading it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|if you are looking for a good price and looks please check these out  they are worth it I well buy again
0767919408|5.0|I am a great fan of Bill Bryson's travel writing, but his history books have been a bit longwinded and dry for my taste.  This is the exception.
020530902X|5.0|I've read through the Elements of Style before and just wanted a copy as reference material and to look up areas I don't feel so confident about. Once I started browsing the contents, I felt as if visiting a long-lost friend. Tightly written prose that instructs as well as entertains,
B000N4SHOE|5.0|LOVE THIS MOVIE ~ acting was excellent too ~ a sleeper. I don't think very many people know of this movie, and that's<br />a shame, especially being a true story
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|Love the franchise.<br />Hoping for a better storyline on the next movie.<br /><br />Maybe throw in an (one or 2 )Avenger as a guest / cameo.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I really liked this season, for the most part. I love that Tom opened up to being part of the family, and that Robert and Corra repaired their relationship. I hate hate hate that Matthew is gone :(
140006922X|5.0|What made this book controversial? It is well written with excellent historical scholarly documentation. It is well written and adds to our knowledge of Jesus. To understand whether or not he was a zealot you have to understand the times and where he lived. That is was makes this book an excellent read.
B00CWM3F4C|3.0|I chose 3 stars because I think the song Voices is fantastic and I also enjoyed Choke and The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here. I've listened to all of the songs but just haven't gotten hooked on others yet. I still find myself falling back to the previous album songs Black Gives Way to Blue, Your Decision and Take Her Out. I do really enjoy the 3 tracks I mentioned and hope I catch on to some of the others.
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|Use it with my Canon 60D which allows me to turn the gain almost all the way down in the camera because of the +20 feature on the mic. Also bought the 10' chord so I can mount the mic on a mic stand for interviews. I have not experienced the 'noise' others have talked about. Love the mic!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|if I had to say some thing it would be that this game is awesome and you know this game is the bomb
B00004YA66|5.0|This movie is awesome,please check it out.  I could study family love in this movie.<br />You would understand what I mean.
B003ZJ70W4|5.0|Watched all 94 episodes and both movies in one month.  I think I need a cigarette!<br />Its all good, not complaining.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|An unparalleled classic. Bogey at his best. Never get tired of it. A movie you must see if you haven't already.
B009UNGYHG|4.0|This is a very handy item for the new Voyager Legend headset.<br /><br />I put it on my nightstand and just drop the headset in each night and in the morning its ready for the whole day.<br /><br />I don't have to fiddle with it to be sure the plugs are lined up and facing the right way.<br /><br />If the cost were a bit lower I would give it 5 stars.<br /><br />Love the unit.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|SUSAN IS SUSAN AGAIN.<br />EXCEPT FOR THE INITIAL SONG THE REST ARE STRICTLY SUSAN BOYLE'S VOICE AS IT ORIGINALLY WAS.  PURE, CLEAR,WITH TREMENDOUS RANGE AND FEELING. THE DUETS WERE AN ADDED TREAT. GOOD CHOICES.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I want more! Great cast, tie in to &#34;The Wrath of Kahn.  Loved special effects, it was easy into the storyline.
0553384775|4.0|Good and fast read...great stories, you will laugh out loud at times. Wish author spent more time on how he built his brokerage business though. Also, not sure how this guy is still alive!
B002C6A6N6|5.0|It portrays what a wonderful place America was in the 19th century. Also, Dr Quinn was an amazing woman who let nothing deter her from her mission. I would place this series in the same category as Little House on the Prairie and The Waltons.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|What a great way to explore the all time best seller.  With daily readings for devotional purposes this app makes the Bible very user friendly.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Really great movie and the 3D is very nicely done on this one. We all enjoyed watching it very much
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|When Chromecast was announced, it was clear that we are looking at a game changer and game changer it is. I have given up plans to go for an expensive Internet enabled Smart TV. The main items I would watch on Smart TV are Youtube, Netflix and Hulu Plus. All of them are available for easy streaming on Chromecast. This tiny little device makes any HDMI enabled TV as a Smart TV saving us hundreds of dollars in the process. I also really like the fact that it does not use processing power or battery from my phone / tablet / laptop. In addition, no more fiddling with the over complicated TV remote! For streaming video that is not yet on-boarded to Chromecast, you can use Chrome browser to cast them but it would use batter power in your laptop.<br /><br />One of the best innovations from Google this year. I would bet that Chromecast is the hottest gift item this holiday season.
B008FWHGYS|4.0|this movie was really good. it made ypu really relate to it. people are human and can make poor decisions and have bad judgement. put together well
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|Does not keep you wanting to read more. The story jumps around too much and I would suggest picking another book.
B005LAIIGW|1.0|Saw the movie in theater today.  It will get Academy Awards for CGI and Photography but the plot was a big dissapointment and waste of two leading actors.  I cannot believe all the great reviews.  I must have seen a different movie.  Wait for it to be on Prime or netflix.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Better then I expected it to be - Mark Ruffalo gave a great performance and it had a surprise ending that was unexpected and enjoyable.  Loved Michael Caine's character and all in all a very entertaining movie.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|but it is impossible to put down. One would think that being kept in the dark is frustrating, but the reader is given enough information to be poor in awesome suspense. Yes, Thomas could have been a stronger character in the beginning--since his emotions went strangely from emotion to emotion--but the story is so compelling that it is not as noticeable as the book goes on. Also, I've never read a book that has so heavily lead to a sequel and a greater world of intense suspense that I am eager to enter.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I don't have a gaming system to be able to watch Netflix on my TV so the Chromecast has been amazing. It is so easy to install and use! We were able to finish watching a show we had started on Netflix by mail which meant we were watching for hours on end. Needless to say, I have a lot of shows of the new season and housekeeping to catch up on!!!
0802473156|5.0|In over 40 years of marriage counseling, I think this is one of most needed books out there. It is practical and it works.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Kept you on the edge of your seat!  The &#34;secret&#34; was not what I was expecting for sure!  A worthy read.
B008Y212PI|4.0|great app it was some more challenging than some of the others. I would highly recommend it to anyone.  give it atry.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|A lovely book of adventure and life and hope. I didn't have any preconceived notions and I'm so happy that I did not. Such big lessons in such a small book. A must read.
B0000266T2|5.0|Worked on post-production of this concert while at Broadway Video in NYC. faithful representation with all the comments from the original including words from Mayor Ed Koch. Makes you feel like you are back in Central Park again.
B0079XPUOW|3.0|Scalzi does a good job of writing the idea. The problem is the idea. It's just too silly for Scalzi to write that good a novel from.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Great book!Totally could not put it down. Can't wait to read the next series. Lot of things in the book took me for a complete surprise
B003M70O5O|5.0|Awesome show. I would recommend this to anyone. It dont matter if your into bikes or not. Great show definitely.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Very interesting. Can't stop reading. Lots of interesting thins, about Tesla, and history of US industry, like GE and Westinghouse, J.P. Morgan
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|I don't skip songs when listening to this one. Blake - you outdid yourself! This is a great album and I love the song Boys 'round here.
B001DUDKEY|2.0|This story has an ending but seems to be missing the beginning.  You know what happened but it's all left to the viewers imagination to fill in the blanks (no flashbacks, no visual support). Sometimes felt that story put on too emphasis on the part that mattered the least.
B00F1RR3Y8|1.0|makeup and nail games are all the same there is nothing to really say except little girls like them for the time being.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Awesome book. Can't wait to read the next book in the series. I'm addicted to these books. Love the characters.
B003M6OW4Y|4.0|I guess it was to smart for the people that make the decisions to ax these types of shows.  Jos Whedon knows how to produce shows!
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|It was a very fun family movie that felt with fear and overcoming it as a family. My almost four year old loved it and we will probably buy it soon.
B00009EJC5|5.0|I wish we still had music like this today. James was the man. I had forgotten how many funky cuts was on this LP.
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|MY 8 year granddaughter loved the game.  But the game continuely required additional purchases of coins or peanuts to enhance the playing experience of the game.  To bad - we deleted the game from the ANDROID.  She became frustrated as well as I.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Whole family loved it. A good choice for a Stay in Friday or Saturday night. This is a movie that will have a Croods 2.
B00005JPO1|5.0|I will have to admit that the only reason that I bought this movie was so that I could watch it while playing the rifftrax of it.  The movie itself is okay, but by the time this movie was made, Harrison Ford was really showing his age.  His ability to outdual/outrun/outgun the bad guys (who are suppossed to be well trained soldiers) is beyond believable.  I did enjoy previous Indiana Jones movies, I still truly believe that Raiders of the Lost Arc is one of the classic &#34;Saturday Matinee&#34; movies and will always enjoy watching it.  At this point in time in the Indiana Jones story arc, any plausible believable moments seem to have faded into the past.<br />My advice....Watch it with the rifftrax treatment and enjoy as Harrison and cast collect one more paycheck!<br />Until then.....GET OFF MY PLANE!!!
B00AEUU4LQ|4.0|Well told story that made me grateful of the many blessings in my life.  Live in great country, great family, good health, all my personal needs more than taken care of.  I wish all the world had peace and prosperity.  Perhaps if democracy and the rule of law spreads the the world will be a better for more people.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|I GAVE IT FIVE STARS,BECAUSE I LOVE IT. IT'S FULL OF ACTION AND LOTS OF FUN TO PLAY. i THINK EVERY ONE SHOULD GIVE IT A TRY.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|If you like KF's historical fiction, this is just a little different. Not bad, but the characters aren't quite as gripping or well developed.
B009NH6JRE|1.0|Unfortunately my son bought it and didn't know it was zoned. So useless !!! A waste of money will buy locally next time
B000JQU1VS|5.0|This book was exactly what I wanted and ordered. Excellent delivery service and the price was right. I would recommend this product.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Good movie but I ordered HD and it didn't look like HD . Other then that this movie is exciting from start to finish.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|Goodfellas is one of my all-time favorite movies.  The characters are memorable and, in many cases, hilarious.  I am a fan of Joe Pesci and his performance does not disappoint.  The film is fast paced and has a great score.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Very good read, it kept my interest for the entire book.  I will read more of this series. Did not figure out what was going to happen until the end
B008602KQI|5.0|EXCELLENT movie, loved the books and the movie!  I highly recommend it and cannot wait to see the rest of the movies!
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Brad showed out in this movie.<br />I fell in love with how smart and brave he had to be.<br />This movie kept my attention the entire time,<br />everything about the movie was exciting.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I think is works petty well. Nice sound quility; It is good price compare with other headphone on the same price level.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Took forever to get here.  Sucks compared to Apple TV.  Thought it would be useful....liked it was cheap.....nevermind, spend the extra couple dollars on Roku with a remote instead.
B001HN6922|5.0|Great.  My grandson who is three -  loved it along with all his other CARS gifts.  He is a happy camper.

B00571F26Y|2.0|Th General concept is removing wheat and wheat sources from your diet because of the harmful modifications that have been made to modern wheat. I agree with this however by the end of the book they are telling to cut wheat, sugar, legumes, soda, most fruits etc from your diet to lose weight. That is not quite what is being advertised here and sounds a lot like any carb free diet, I feel they did this so that people will have dramatic weight loss results which will happen if you cut all these items from your diet however, why be deceptive about it?  All that said there are some good pieces of information and a few interesting recipes.
1451695195|4.0|It's a nice book and I enjoyed hearing about this man's experience.  Helpful with the grieving process.  I would recommend it.
B00136NUG6|5.0|I loved EWF when they first came out and still love them.  Just can't help it feel happy and dance when you hear their music.  Best DVD in my collection.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|Great book keep me wanting more and wishing it was me finding a Todd for myself.  I would recommend it to anyone.
0425263908|5.0|Wow! This book has scorching love scenes, a sophisticated story line with perfect character development through out each book.You cant wait to get to the next chapter to find what happens next. Extremely well written.
0425263916|5.0|I love how the book holds your interest and has new secret spins on Gideon Cross. The characters develop beautifully through out the book . I love the interaction between Gideon and Eva who are both broken( emotionally )and try to heal each other. I love the Compelling story .
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Blu-ray DVD for great price, quick shipping.  wouldn't pay this in the strore.<br />Movie is must for sci-fy fans.  enjoy
B000FC2KL0|5.0|Struggling with addiction myself, I found this useful.  Wasn't a fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers until I read his book.
142311339X|4.0|I really enjoyed this book...It takes place after the last Olympian, so you might wanna read Percy Jackson and the Olympians first, just to get an understanding. The book ends with many mysteries unsolved ( who is Jason,why have Jason and Percy's memories been stolen, who stole those memories, etc. This book isn't perfect though.but the Series is! The book adds new characters,old characters,a new prophecy,and roman gods! So catch up with your roman history.i don't wanna give away too much,so. Read it!
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|I rented this movie and downloaded it to my kindle so as to watch it on a flight from Chicago.  However, when I pulled it up to watch, it indicated there was a technical error or difficulty and was unable to watch it. apparently the movie didnt download properly. I lost out.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Love this show! Really good writing, formulaic but fun story within each episode with superb character development over the course of the season.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Gene Roddenberry et. al. nailed Star Trek like Shakespeare nailed human behavior.  Star Trek has been with me for nigh on to fifty years.  It is as timeless and appropriate to parallel our human capacities as any movie in existence.  I hope we grow old with Chris Pine like we did with William Shatner and his crew.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|My wife's been want to watch this for a while. We couldn't get it on demand so being able to stream to the iPad came in very handy.
B006N57PXG|5.0|I'm still not sure who the protagonist was in this story. Maybe it was the young boy, Nathaniel, a precocious magician trainee or more likely, Bartimaeus, a powerful djinni that he conjured and assigned to steal the Amulet of Samarkand. It certainly wasn't Simon Lovelace, a mature and dangerous magician who humiliated Nathaniel inciting his idealistic boyhood revenge.<br /><br />Regardless, Stroud is a master storyteller who takes us through the clandestine occult journey of the demon driven by Nathaniel's naïvet&eacute;.  I found this engaging novel in the Junior Reader section of a local bookstore. The diction and language is not middle-grade. I was forced to my dictionary many times. I can only conclude that it was placed in this section because one of the protagonists, Nathaniel, was eleven-years-old.<br /><br />The tension in the plot was uneven, although constantly rising toward a climax that was as unexpected as it was totally inescapable.  I heartily recommend this to any young reader or adult who enjoys high fantasy and the literary use of the English language.
B004EF65QA|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the story and the actors.  If you love period movies this is a don't miss.  Wonderful story, beautifully done.
B0058RCVYS|5.0|I enjoy foreign films . This movie was well written . The story line held my interest. Great film for a lonely evening.
B0090X4GLW|4.0|This was a request from my music loving Stepdaughter.  She loves it!  She and her 2 year old go around the house singing the songs with the CD.  Good choice for a gift.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I never really liked The Shining all that much, but I'm a serious Stephen King fan. So when I saw that Dr. Sleep was out, I had to read it. I rewatched The Shining first, getting ready for it. Again, I was not overly impressed. I also didn't expect to really enjoy Dr. Sleep, I just had to see. This book grabbed my attention and kept it the entire time. I never felt myself drifting away from the story, like I do with so many. King has truly evolved. His characters in this story were so much better developed than any of his past books. He just keeps getting better and better!
B00BQ4NLC8|4.0|An intricately meshed story weaving in an out by well defined characters.<br />The characters face and resolve moral dilemmas ranging from confessing to life changing history and putting XO XO in a text message after having an one night stand.<br />Recommend a read.
B00EMAGCJM|1.0|And the demoralization of our society continues with another album by a self absorbed, spoiled child star whose father never bothered to pick up a parenting book.  How sad that parents will buy this album for their children.  From on disturbed child to another I suppose.  And America continues its march downward.
B00338QENI|5.0|I haven't read this yet, but I purchased it because my friend told me it was a MUST READ that she just couldn't put down!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is one of those amazing page-turners that I devoured in 24 hours. I couldn't put the book down! The book follows three main characters, Cecelia, Rachel, and Tess, who all live in the same community and whose lives are connected in ways in which none of them can possibly imagine. I do not want to give anything about the book away, but it is entertaining, suspenseful, clever, and all-around fabulous. \\"The Husband's Secret\\" is pne of the best books I've read all year. Definitely check it out!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I thought it was a great movie, lots of action! I loved it!!! would recommend to all my friends! love Robert Downey Jr.
B002CSC5EC|4.0|Like this blu-ray version with all the extra performances that were not in original release. Sound is better and I like the different interviews with the hippie folks. Picture is little better then first,the extras are interesting in the fact that you learn how important editors are. The whole Grateful Dead (jam?) should have stayed on the floor where it belongs....
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love it. Nuff said. Da da da.  Da da da. Cool as the other side the pillow. If ya don't got it, get it.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Love how they finally brought all the characters together. Looking forward to another movie hope they bring back everyone or add new Avengers!
B0094K1WZE|3.0|*** CONTAINS SPOILERS ***<br /><br />Overall, the movie was just disappointing. There were a lot of bad little things that left me wanting more. A signature of the MI series are cool gadgets that actually work. Most of the gadgets in this movie must have been from Walmart because most end up breaking or not working right. Let's count shall we? Awesome glass gloves...busted. Magnetic cart thing...nope. Mask making machine...sorry. Hallway projector screen...can't handle more than one set of eyes. Camera contacts...great until you want to blink. Fake IDs...please wait, uploading.  Smartphone assassination warning...oops, too late. Come on! These gadgets are supposed to be awesome and work! One of the few things that did work was a balloon that was magically maneuverable...don't ask me how.<br /><br />Most of the time our good guys are bungling their way through some sort of mashed up mission. Originality is gone because our bad guy is literally an evil genius...really? Yet for some reason he decides to hobble off a parking garage falling to his death when all he needed to do was toss the \\"nuclear football\\" case over the edge. Speaking of nuclear. Why not just contact the Russian government and tell them their nuclear codes have been compromised? Even if they don't take it seriously how hard is it to change the codes, you know, just in case? Done. Evil genius defeated! Lastly the movie was very slow for an action movie. I understand it can't be all action for 2 hours but the sequences in between were painful. I get it, they're a rag tag team all alone but it didn't quite work for me.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Five stars are not enough, this book sucked me into to a whole new take on the paranormal world and I loved it!  Yes it's peopled with your normal characters, vampires, witches, daemons but, what Ms. Harkness does with them makes this a new experience and one I could not put down.  It is a world not to be missed.<br />Diana and Matthew are great protagonists.  Likable, annoying, intriguing and very real as they begin the slow dance from mistrust and fear to friendship and beyond.<br />If this is on your to read list get it now, you are in for a wonderful ride!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Decent time killer. Lots of upgrades for buildings and troops/weapons. Almost too many. Graphics are good. Several playing options...quests, multiplayer attack, setting bounties, collecting allows...you are allowed to concentrate on areas you like, although you must at least do a little of each.<br /><br />I did hit one glitch that caused all of my income generating buildings to stop collecting for half a day, which was frustrating.<br /><br />I have made in-app purchases on other games, but not on this game. The purchases available on this game are way too expensive for what you get. If they gave you more for the money, I'd be much more likely to pay.<br /><br />Some of the games forums mention a lot of problems with hackers, but I haven't had any trouble with hackers after about a week of playing...now level  20. I have seen a fair number of other bases that are so built up with costly items that the player is either spending a small fortune of real money to buy them, or has developed his own means of&quot;acquiring&quot; them.<br /><br />Overall, still enjoying this game enough to keep playing. Will update if anything changes.
B009RX7WTI|5.0|Grey's Anatomy is my favorite show ever! I've been following it ever since it began! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! Thanks
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really like this.  I was having difficulty with recharging my Kindle, and I wasn't able to determine the status of the charge until I downloaded this app.  Once it was downloaded, I was able to monitor the progress, and realized that the Kindle was actually charging.
1400069289|1.0|I really liked this book in the beginning.  i couldn't put it down.  Then it got to creating a crisis when there is not one.  Praising  the Obama administration for igniting panic and pandemonium among the American people is not my idea of a beneficial book for an entrepreneur.  I would not even donate this book.  It will go to the trash pile where it belongs.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I have read all three books now and I want more.  Did he really die?  I also have decided to go to Sweden sometime in my life.
B00006ADD5|5.0|Probably one of the best movies ever made. Helps to understand the history behind a dynamic part of the world.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|This guy is awesome! If you haven't  heard of him, you are behind the curve.  This is a must have.
B000PC0S5K|4.0|This book is jam packed with spiritual concepts and ways to transfer for your thinking. It's really phenomenal but it's a slow read. I can't do more than 20-30 pages at a time because it takes some though and thorough consideration.  Great principles though!
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|So far so good works great learning alot just have to be consistent and do some each day it only takes a few minutes.
B00ECKKCRK|5.0|Recording is first rate.  BLS side not many people know about....tracks from Book of Shadow are amazing.  If you are a BLS fan this is a great addition.  First rate music for the road.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This historical documentary of the life of Jesus was well researched and equally well written. It gives Jesus the man the place he truly deserved in history. For years I have wondered and pondered over the things that I believed about the man I worship and adore. This book helped me to feel that I am not wrong in my beliefs.
B002I9Z8I0|3.0|You can take that review title several ways, and the movies as well. I recall enjoying the movie as a kid a lot more. I recall the first movie as a lot more interesting when I was young; this time I will sum it up as a whole lot of watching characters stare at the main view screen as the Enterprise slowly, painfully, crawls through a giant glowy cloud.  I enjoyed Wrath of Khan, especially after watching the \\"prequels\\" - the old TV episode, and JJ Abrahm's new take in Star Trek Into Darkness.<br /><br />I will sum it up by saying: At least I bought it on sale as an Amazon Daily Deal; otherwise I might have felt cheated - the movies just weren't as good as I remembered them.
B004774D14|5.0|Fue mi libro favorito y por eso fue uno de mis libros en mi examen de español. El libro es facil para leer. Tiene información sobre la vida en Mexico al principio de los 1900's. Y se puede probar las recetas. Cuidado... A mi me gusta la pelicula también.
078401115X|3.0|Harry Angel is a private detective (played by Mickey Rourke) hired by an eccentric old gentleman (Robert De Niro) to find a man who went missing years ago. I found the movie pretty riveting, and you wonder who is making moves behind the scenes up until the very end of the movie. Warning: this movie does have a lot of obscenities, and if you are squeamish about blood and voodoo rituals there are a few scenes that might bother you. I originally saw this movie over 20 years ago, but the plot stuck in my mind all these years so I got the DVD to watch it again. I enjoyed it very much, although I didn't remember the blood or the cursing; as I said, it was the plot that really stuck with me.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|simple easy to use and reliable. sometimes apps tend to misbehave bt this have not given me any trouble yet.
B008JFUO72|5.0|I liked the first two movies, and Marvel's Avengers movie. I liked this one as well.  My friend watched this for a few minutes and said \\"boy that Tony is a real jerk\\". Yup - that about sums up the character of Tony Stark - an arrogant, likeable jerk - brings out the human side in all of us.  I'm not a big comic book fan, so I don't really understand the complaints about how the Mandarin character doesn't match the comics. As a movie though, I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I'm only nine years old and I still love this game it's multiplayer because me and my cousin play it together
B001N44BW0|4.0|I liked this movie - it goes back and forth between a boss with a life in America, and the man on the ground in the Middle East. There is quite a bit of violence in this movie, but only one scene really had me feeling squeamish - the torture scene with the hammer near the end. After watching it it did make me wonder about some of the folks we have in government - I saw plenty of similar attitudes during my stint in the military. I will probably watch this one a few more times.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|What a fascinating book! Loved the energy experiments....every single one. This was a quick and easy read you will love.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|this was great -  although I thought I read that the special features were different, but other than that - the item was good.<br /><br />I don't like the bluray menu - not as sleek as others I've seen.
0143116371|5.0|If you like Scott Schuman's blog, you will love this book.  A very nice collection of his earlier work on the streets of the fashion world.
1451673442|5.0|I love this book. I've read &#34;The Secret&#34; before, and this book is a great follow up, it's like &#34;The Secret&#34; on steroids! The things she writes make a lot of sense and the exercises are great. I'm not very much into flowing things step by step, so I did not do all the exercises exactly as requested, and yet I can see great results and a great effect in my life. Love it, love it, love it!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book is a feast for the senses. I devoured it in three days and feel slightly displaced now that it's over.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Awesome book, best money I ever spent! Couldn't put it down. Truly Life changing . Thank you Pam Grout. Xo
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I just find the psychology behind these guys interesting, the training, the immense willpower needed to do this. The book itself was decently written - no masterpiece but that's not the point of telling this tale. For its purpose, it was good and did the job.
B000BNX4MC|4.0|He was everywhere,<br />and he was absent.  He made coherent arguments for marriage at an age when noobody wanted to talk about any such thing-<br />I wonder if they would have gotten married.  Would he be a good husband.<br /><br />Certainly other movies explore the economically burgeoning Chicago, but that's painted thick here.<br />Another tool is the 'day as so important it can be documented in entirety and take up the whole movie.'  Yep.<br />I loved this movie.  Even back when I didn't know what a 'testicle' was, I loved the movie  Lol.<br /><br />I think in the 80's there was a 'type,' of darkly handsome man who somehow has large license and does whatever he wanted with it -- in this case, it wasn't too bad (as Cameron might say, 'Meh.').  In hindsight Ferris did nothing, on a fantastic scale.  It's fun to watch, and maybe not worth writing a super-long review about.  Oops!<br /><br />One thing I haven't really figured out about this movie; why did the restaurant host call the police?  To report Abe Froman?  :}  I don't know!  I suppose one more thing to keep my eyes open about and learn from life!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excelent story line. Great character development. Superb acting. I recommend this show to everyone. I can not imagine anyone not enjoying it.
0385535147|5.0|As many others has stated I haven't purchased a Grisham book in a while. I took a chance on this and I'm happy I did. I read this in a single sitting. Something I cannot say about many books I have read in the last few years. This was by far one of the best books I've read this year. I could not put this down. I was drawn into the plot, with its twists and turns. Just when I thought I had it all figured out there was another twist at the end. Based on this work I just might be back to purchasing and reading Grisham. Malcolm Bannisters character was very well developed, others were developed enough to fit the plot, action was non stop, plot moved to its conclusion at a single sitting pace, with a refreshing twist.
B008XKSW7M|2.0|It was really stupid for the most part. I'm eight months pregnant and think they only included cliche pregnancy experiences and didn't actually talk to pregnant women. The characters were too stereotypical and makes depth or originality. The end was somewhat better for a few of the plot lines, so if you make it through the first half, don't turn it off like I was tempted to do.
B00B7ERH04|1.0|I have a Kindle fire an  it would not work. The graphics were blurry an  the noise was awful. Deleted immediately.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|What a great story! :)  I am a adult and love watching this movie! This movie is fun and educational. It will teach you about culinary arts and what it's like to work in a kitchen. Wish they would come out with a part 2
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|This was a good follow up to the Ironman story. Robert Downey Jr. is superb as Tony Stark and I loved the story.
B0011ZVTEO|5.0|These guy's rock! This music will haunt your soul and inspire romance and passion in your life! I don't regret buying this album.
B0055D3EOG|4.0|This movie is scary and has a good story. Sort of reminded me of Amityville Horror and Poltergeist put together.
B004GYY714|5.0|I listen to a lot of OTR (old time radio) Old radio shows that were the precursors of many early TV shows like &#34;DRAGNET&#34;....I'm sure that's not what the app designers had in mind becasue there seems to be a lot of good music on some of these stations. I've just turned out like I said I b=never would, &#34;OH that music is just loud&#34; Just shoot me now, becasue that's what I said they'd have to do to me if I ever started talking like that...well, never say never!! :-)))<br /><br />GREAT APP
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love the easy navigation through the app. An its very interactive. It makes u wanna keep on playing and playing
B003NX76BM|5.0|Love the story. It had me from the very beginning.  It had romance, comedy, suspense and an inside look at search and rescue.<br />I have read it more than once. This is one of Nora's best books.  I highly recommend it.
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|This was a pretty good movie.  Comedy and romance mixed together.  I would recommend watching this movie if you enjoy comedy and romance.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I saw this in the movie theater, twice.  It makes me laugh every time.  I love this silly humor and one liners.
B009C7JS14|4.0|This app is good for getting the weather quickly.  I have it loaded on my Kindle and it does the job.
B00FEN1C50|5.0|Having been a fan of Japanese monster movies all my life, I tend to be somewhat jaded on this subject. That being said this movie offers a terrific fresh story line and the special effects are second to none.
B00DW2PDH8|5.0|Luna Sanguis by Simon Okill is an intriguing read. Exploring what happens when a vampire has amnesia, the novel switches from Rose's reality to what might be memories and hallucinations. This is done in such a skillful way as to really convey Rose's own confusion. However, I was able to follow along easily. The thing I really liked about these reality shifts is that it mirrors a mind in deep distress and it made Rose very sympathetic, while also wondering what monstrous life she had led prior to her loss of memory.    Many of the characters are not very sympathetic when viewed through Rose's eyes. However, even that is suspect with her, leaving the reader with mystery upon mystery, and wondering what their true natures were.    Possibly one of the most likable characters is Edouard. We got enough glimpses of him to sense he just might be the good guy and Rose's salvation, but the answer to that lies later in the series.    Okill's writing style is different - dark and very seductive as he paints the pictures in vivid colors. He draws you in to his world whether you want to go or not.    A side note - there were some typos that were a bit distracting, but I was drawn back in by Okill's prose.    It should also be noted that the story will be continued and is not resolved in Book 1.    I enjoyed the book and I'm looking forward to the rest of the series.    UPDATE: I've just finished the newest edition and I've upgraded my review from 4 stars to 5 stars. The editing issues have been resolved and this version was quite crisp and clean.     One extra note: the book is very dark, with graphic violence and explicit sex/rape scenes, so I recommend this for 18+ only.
1616615362|4.0|good quality and fun game piece. fun game. 12 more words to complete the comments section is required to complete.
B004WE01YA|5.0|Lesson learned. Buy these when they come available at the store. Don't wait till Disney stops producing and they end up costing you $50 like this was for me. Happy with the product though.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game to buy and I suggest that you buy it is a great game to pass the time u can get addictive to it and forget the time and before you know it you are late sometimes I wish I never downloaded it. It is a great game thought
0345533666|5.0|This novel really makes you think about relationships and how you might deal with the same situation, but in the end, it is your choice.
B00001QEE2|5.0|My three year old grandson watched my copy of Hercules on my VCR and loved it so much, he kept asking to see it again and again.  I ordered him this DVR version so that he could take it back with him to Germany where his Daddy is stationed.  The little ones in our family always enjoy Disney films.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It'a a really fun game, although sometimes is not that challenging I had a great time playing it. The only problems is that is too short! I was having a great time and flying through the level and the app ended in no time.
B009JZSFUY|4.0|One of my favorite older Star Trek movies, lots of action and a good story to back it up. Fun.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun and challenging! It's a great game. It has levels for all kind of players, easy ones for kids and hard ones for the players that likes a good challenge.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is very addicting and fun to play. I enjoy searching for items. I feel it helps challenge my mind
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|This game is so addicting I played it for two hours straight the first time I played.  It gets pretty hard too!
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|I love to read and normally will not put a book down until I've read it cover to cover.  This book is so boring that I read a little bit and then go find something else to read or do.
B001BANK32|5.0|Stephen King is by far my favorite author.  No one else can grab me from the first paragraph and suck me in to the whole story the way he can.<br /><br />This is one of his scariest, in my opinion.  It's something we can relate to.  Being completely isolated up on a snowed in mountain top.  No way to get down. No way to get help.  And your husband/father starts really going nutso.  Love this book!
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|Using elements of main timeline Star Trek, this alternate timeline continues on with a good amount of action, humor, and a great villain performance by Benedict Cumberbatch.<br />I know I'm treading on thin ice with a lot of critics and movie-goers, but I like to be entertained, so I find myself quite forgiving. But this movie had everything a sci-fi junkie could want: a solid storyline, great &#34;battle&#34; scenes, and Chris Pine for the ladies, Alice Eve for the guys, or swap 'em if that's your thing.<br />5 stars for the very detailed industrial environment of an engine room - the outside of the anti-matter reactor is amazing! -1 star for the lens flares. Yeah, JJ Abrams. You do use them just a little much, which you know, and are in rehab for.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I began this series at the suggestion of a friend & I am not sorry.  EXCELLENT book!  I found myself reading this in a little over a day & couldn't wait to download the next book.  Very well written.  Extremely Captivating !!
B00F35BV64|5.0|I thought I was a mini-trekkie, i only like a few star trek series [ mostly Next Gen. ] and never got around to the original movies.<br /><br />Not only did i LOVE the first one of these recent makes, this second prequel may have even been better, not sure.!<br />It certainly made me want to go discover the originals.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|super fun hidden object game! The story is crazy too. I definitely. recommend this game to anyone who enjoys hidden object games. g5 and big fish are great.
B0058VW36U|2.0|I heard it was a great game so I purchased it for my child and I to play.  It does not load most of the time.  When it does the game takes a long time to load, with error messages. This is for a Kindle Fire HD(January 2013).
B005EHILV4|5.0|For this to be a very small compact mixer. It packs a serious punch! I have been able to put together my studio in my office. Hooked it up to my keyboard and my MPC 2000XL and do what I need to do as far as putting my beats together. I definitely recommend. Oh and the delivery was super fast!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|love this show!!! Keeps me intrigued from start to finish!!! I watch an episode every night!!! everyone should watch it !
B005LAIH2C|4.0|I gave this 4 stars because it's a good movie. Only thing is Hansel and Gretel are American set in what seems to be an perhaps old English setting. Overall the it was really good entertainment.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Very good movie, Graphics were great audio and soundtrack were amazing and a great story line with amazing screenplay, I would recomend this movie to any one! not for kids though.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|very good, very good ,love the movie, I would recommend it, I havent read the book, I didnt like the way the help was treated in the movie it made me mad but I guess thats history, very educational
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Brilliant and addictive to begin with but waiting for the lives is tedious and the collection pieces are a pain to get so it gets boring quickly as I can only play for short amounts of time.
0783231202|5.0|very good, very good ,love movie, would recomend, I love that debbie allen did this movie I had no idel about this boat, everyone should see this
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I bought the Selection first, read it in one day & was over the moon to get the Elite, was so sad to have to wait till next year to get the last one :--((

B008Y212PI|5.0|This is a great game that will challenge you while you try to see what picture will appear  after you solve the puzzle.  Not recommended for those who are impatient.  Have fun solving the PUZZLES.
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|I love being a star it so fun u can text all the other star OMG. I will play this game everyday.
B008PE9GSA|5.0|If you like classic ZZ Top, this album reminds me of that era.  I have all the studio albums in my collection and there have been a couple that in my humble opinion didn't hold up to the classics, this album did for me.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|Time means different things to different people.I am sure all of you have been agrivated by the actions of another person,but hopefully you have not acted on an impulse as the suspense of this novel reveals about the main character of this novel.
B0067RQYNW|4.0|I used this for the first time as I was attending a conference today.  It worked smoothly and effectively.  This is even more impressive since I am using one of the most low end tablets, still using Android 2.2.
B001F12J0C|5.0|Well what can a girl say?  Im pretty sure we all love Matt Damon<br />so this trilogy is worth every dime :).....I love these kind of movies<br />and to me this is absolutely one of the best trilogies ever!
B00E38KGF4|5.0|I have worked with a lot of AV products in the line of my work, and have always liked Bitdefender.  I recently replaced my AVG AV on my tablet, with Bitdefender, and was happy, and highly impressed.  This detected many files I was messing with accurately.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|My sun is a lego nut and wanted this. He just started second grade and got this for his B'day. He worked on it after school and took about 2 days. So don't get discouraged by the 16+ age given on the box. If you kid loves legos, he or she will love this.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I was scared by The Shining in my youth (second in scariness level only to &#34;Dracula&#34;) but never really wondered about Danny Torrance.  Still, nice to see what happened to him and even better to meet Abra and see that Danny turned out to be a very good guy as an adult.  Of course, now I want to know what happens to Abra....  And wondering if The Overlook's issues ever get resolved....  Sounds like a trilogy to me.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have been in Atlanta, GA for three weeks and this book has helped me pass the time. Great book.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I use this app very often.  Very clear and easy to use.  No more guessing how much battery I have left :)
B000L53D4O|5.0|My baby loves the walker andv I appreciate the prompt delivery the overall experience was satisfactory and I would recommend to friends
B008DBF5Z8|2.0|We ordered this device because it was portable and could be carried from classroom to classroom.  However, we have found that with normal classroom lighting, the quality of the projection is poor.  If we can darken the room significantly, then the quality is &#34;okay&#34;.<br /><br />Wish there was a better camera that was portable.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Recommend this vid for all Zombie Apocalypse fans.  Actually found it to have a little more thought and plot to it than most zombie take-over shows!
B007ZGO7EM|2.0|Not exactly what I was expecting but works fine for what it does.  Thought it would have more options.  I will still get some good use out of it
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The storyline is amazing and the ending is very touching. I really like how the two main characters Hazel and Augustus communicate with each other. Great book for young readers.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This works great. Easy setup and start playing movies. I use it of Netflix and You Tube.  Wish it worked with amazon instant movies.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is the best game for androids some of the cut scenes have<br />well not the best graphics but game play is awesome I recommend it to anyone.<br />I mite make  game play videos on this.<br />Get the game story is awesome
0451209338|3.0|But I couldn't warm up to the characters in this one at all.  I'll probably try something by this author again some time.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Great movie had me to the very end.  Worth the time in my opinion.  I was fully entertained with the twists.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This is challenging, but not so challenging it is impossible. Also not way too small of a grid like some similar games.
B000ICZD5M|2.0|Imagine if Peter Jackson had condensed the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy into one 2hr movie... That is what you have here. There just isn't enough time to develop/explain the world and the story. Even having read the book, the movie felt disjointed. If you haven't already read the book, you have no hope of following the plot let alone understanding all the rich nuance intended by Herbert. If the plot summary interests you, go read the book! It is great, and definitely worth the time.
B000001EXB|2.0|There are worse albums in Elton John's catalogs than 1998's \\"The Big Picture\\" - I've already reviewed several of them. However, while it doesn't quite sink to the level of \\"Leather Jackets\\" or \\"Victim of Love,\\" \\"The Big Picture\\" is Elton (and Bernie Taupin) at his most generic and uninspired.<br /><br />Unlike those previous efforts, there's no real underlying factor (drug abuse, attempting to stay relevant) to why \\"The Big Picture\\" is a subpar effort. It's not terrible, and it's certainly more listenable than the other two atrocities I listed (not to mention superior to \\"A Single Man\\" and perhaps \\"Ice on Fire\\"), but it suffers from a combination of maudlin lyrics and uninspired melodies and syrupy arrangements that do little to distinguish one track from the other. Several really good songs (\\"Recover Your Soul,\\" \\"Live Like Horses,\\" \\"Wicked Dreams\\") lose their potential due to being smothered by garish, overbearing electronic arrangements that overshadow their more organic elements.<br /><br />The album's best remembered track, the mega-hit \\"Something About the Way You Look Tonight,\\" (the lead track on the double-single that brought forth the all-time bestselling \\"Candle in the Wind 1997\\"), is trite lyrically but is sold by Elton's passionate vocal and a subtler arrangement than the rest of the tracks. Don't get me wrong, it's certainly bombastic, but not nearly as bad as some of the other tracks here.<br /><br />\\"The Big Picture\\" is not a classic by any means, and is undoubtedly one of Elton's weakest efforts.
B009CV5GX4|5.0|Gladwell's insight and thorough research always make for interesting reading. How we pick up on subtleties in our observations that trigger our minds to say that what we are looking at may not be as it seems, goes for those &#34;feelings&#34; or vibes one gets from meeting another person that &#34;just isn't right&#34;, may mean the difference between life and death in some instances.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Watched all 3 seasons of Downton this summer and cannot wait until season 4!  Great performances.  Can't wait to see what happens next!
B007Z9QTVI|5.0|What a great movie. I was pleasantly surprised especially since the original review came from my 80 year old mother. This is a movie for teenagers as well.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Watched all 3 seasons of Downton this summer and cannot wait for season 4!  Great performances!  Cannot wait to see what happens next!
B008LFY6NI|4.0|What fun without the mess. I only wish the save functon allowed for a btter quality image. Otherwise it would have gotten 5 tars.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Nice game with no issues as far as I am concerned.  Helps keep your mind sharp while having fun at the same time.
B002T8Q5SW|4.0|When I was younger I didn't appreciate this cd but I listened to it in full when i got older and understood it more..  Manson seemed to be at one point every parent's nightmare but his music is much more than that.  His music is pure art.  The only songs I don't like on this cd are the slower songs like \\"man that you fear\\",  although it is favored by many.  The majority of songs here are 'in your face', fast, hard hitting-angst, poetic songs.<br /><br />-Lyrics are deep..  makes you think<br /><br />-Has an \\"industrial\\" music sound..<br /><br />-Some songs sound 'metal', although some people don't categorize Manson as 'metal' but whatever
B00E7PQVHK|4.0|Only got a 4 star because of the minor issues other reviewers pointed out bout this is a great strategy game. Love it!!!
B00867HDTA|4.0|I really enjoy this game, but I kept finding myself sitting at the menu. The challenges were to easy. It would be cool to have challenges that have you kick from midfield or something. Overall a pretty good game.
B003TH14H4|5.0|This is by far one of the best shows on TV. The mix of comedy with that of the procedural drama is perfect.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The first version I installed was perfect for me.  I travel for work and it was great for checking forecasts for my destinations.  As time passed and updates were made it became less about the weather and more about the advertisement, much like its TV parent.  I've since switched to Weather Bug.
B000OCXI3K|5.0|I've read this book twice.  I loved it so much the first time.  It really spoke to me.  Then I was so excited to see the movie.  They butchered it.  I've read it again years later, after the movie faded from my vision and I fell in love again.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Sadly shares nothing with the book beyond the title. Decent zombie movie and decent action movie as well. Not too much gore or suspense to constantly remind you you are watching a zombie flick.
B00127RAJY|1.0|I recently bought this video also with two others: Reach with Kari Anderson and Weight Loss Pilates with Ellen Barrett.  I gave the two latter videos a 5 star rating and the Jillian 30 Day Shred 1 star.  I simply didn't not like the transitions from standing to floorwork.  I prefer to do all my standing exercises and then do all my floorwork.  Here are some other workout videos I have, that I would recommend:  Any of the Walk at Home videos with Leslie Sansone; The Get Ripped series with Jari Love.
B00FEN1C50|1.0|Sucks alien eggs!y 9 and 0 year olds could not finish it because it felt like wasting their weekend time!
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|Adele is unique in the way that she is still able to sing, write and perform from a powerful place that's true to her on an emotional level, which is why it resonates so much with people who listen to her. You know she's been through some s#!t, and tells you all about when she writes. Fantastic work!
B0049J2BSM|5.0|My 2 year old is pretty selective with movies, but she just loves Monsters Inc. A great movie for girls' night in our house. She wasn't even phased by some of the scarier parts.
B004EPYZU8|5.0|This is one of the most imaginative, fantastic movies ever made. Many people who I have spoken to are unable to see the things that i see when I watch it, because they're too busy trying to fit a round peg into a square hole. It's not as straightforward as many movies like to be, and end up falling short, and fairly contrived. This movie forces you to think and feel for these girls and there struggle. Once again, amazing movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My kids love to play this, it's a bit easier to deal with than the full version on PC.  Definitely have to keep an eye on how much time they spend on it, they will take whatever they can get.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This is an amazing album but (at the time) a very humble and talented artist! I first heard of Kayne with his producing work! Especially beanie! This is a great album to fall back and listen beginning to end if you listen deeply you can hear the story of how he got here .... And a track talking about religion which is hard to come by in hip hop....<br />Favorite tune- never let me down!<br /><br />Now the current Kayne west is a absolute mess and basically destroyed his career when he opened his mouth .... What happen is he tried to release quick garbage into the street and no one bought that bs! I.e 808s and heartbreak .... He should have just released a greatest hits album at that point!
B00D6SBOWG|4.0|It's my first time playing this!  It'll hook you at the first tee.  This is a must have to help pass time.  His of fun!
B007FTZDN8|5.0|Many different subjects to choose from.<br />Most of the presentations are well prepared and well done. Those presentations that in English but with heavy foreign accent are sometimes hard to follow.<br /><br />Big plus is the wide range of subject matter to choose!
B004JMY312|5.0|Someone took my DVD  . We were wanting to watch this so bad what a nice option to have thanks .
B00003CX8V|5.0|I have always liked Jack Lemmon and this is just another classic example of how great of an actor he was.
B00F8L2VO4|1.0|Have no idea what the app is like since it would not allow me access with my chosen email address!
B009PNQUXO|5.0|It is so awesome that I can download videos i want on my kindle and watch them anytime, anywhere! (Since the kindle cannot use internet without WiFi.) The only downside is that it takes up kindle storage. Other than that, awesome app! Totally recommend this to anyone who likes youtube. Don't get any other youtube download app, download THIS ONE NOW!!!!! :)
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|I originally watched it in a theater but the sound was so loud it gave me a headache but what I saw I liked so I could not wait to get a dvd to watch at home. When viewed where you could relax and watch and listen it was a bit boring and slow despite near non stop action. Maybe too much action and too little internal logic. I still like the new characters in this reborn series but I would like to see the next one not depend so much on the original TV series plot lines.<br /><br />I guess there was a good reason to have the sound so loud in the theater after all!
B00114RKT8|5.0|This is a well crafted gem! From stellar acting to beautiful period detail to inspired writing, this movie delivers it all. I've seen it 3-4 times and never fail to walk away amazed. &#34;I am a great sinner, and Christ is a great Savior.&#34; Love this movie!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Of course the Pinterest app is going to get a 5 star rating from me. It's just like the website, only portable and more convenient! I can take my obsession anywhere now!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Definitely recommend this to King fans and Shining lovers.  Not in his top 10 for me, but totally enjoyable. Fast-paced and I enjoyed being back in that world.
1476727651|3.0|Great start: Danny is still a kid and haunted by the Overlook's ghost...that was the teaser.<br />It goes downhill from there. Dan is an adult, wrecked by alcoholism and struggling to piece his life back together.<br />Daddy issues are a bit of a theme in the book, but one gets used it.<br /><br />I expected better, I wanted the Shining rekindled, to feel that fear I felt when I first read about the hedge animals stalking closer, not a ok story about soul-energy vampires and a special kid (recurring theme in King's books). Even during the most tense situation where you expect the worst, everything turns out a-ok for the protagonists, like a walk in the park.<br /><br />I hope Stephen King has a few good horror novels left in him before we refer to him as Doctor Sleep.
B003V5ED7W|5.0|Love this movie! perfect classic and so funny my husband and i actually watched it on our way to jamaica.  so fun!
B00F35BV64|5.0|Great movie makes u want to see all the startreks. A movie the hole family would want to see,wow wow.
B00ESY77LO|5.0|Good story and well acted.  Dicaprio nailed it.  Spider-mans narration is well done Old Boy!  I won't buy it but i'll watch it again on Prime or Netflix.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I really enjoy my Kindle.  It does everything that I want it to do.<br />It keeps you from getting bored when you have to wait somewhere.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|The multiple story lines kept me reading. and wanting  to find out what happen to each character kept me interested.
B005LAIH2C|4.0|If you're going for series here, you won't like this movie.  It has good action, great graphics and awesome characters.  If you go in looking for a humorous movie about killing monsters you'll like it.  Looking for in-depth storytelling or 'realistic' in any way and you probably won't.  That being said, I really did enjoy it and had a really good time watching it.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I have been a Star Trek fan since it's TV days. When they said they were doing the &#34;before&#34; the original I had my misgivings, but have to admit they have done a wonderful job with it. I have become a fan of all the people in it, and now follow their careers as well....
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I really like the first of the &#34;New&#34; Star Trek series so I was impressed when I enjoyed this one even more.  It's got all your favorite characters back, some good plot twists, a compelling villain and non-stop action.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|I bought this because the actors were two of my favorites. The movie has excitement, sentiment, and humor, all rolled up into one package. I loved it.....
B009VLX8FS|4.0|For someone who usually can't stand Taylor Swift, I was embarrassed to admit that I'm actually a big fan of this album. And getting it for only few dollars, even better!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the Fault in Our Stars. From the witty jokes and humor to the sweet love story, I loved it all. One thing I love about John Green's writing style is how many allusions he has. Hazel is a cancer patient who's not in remission, but doesn't have life threatening cancer at the moment. When she's forced to go to a support group for &#34;cancer patients&#34; Hazel's friends become 2 cancer patients. One who's already lost an eye to the disease and is about to become blind and another who has a prosthetic leg. They become more than friends, and by the end of the book (although this wasn't entirely the case for me) you'll be reaching for the Kleenex. I recommend this to everyone and anyone.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|What can I say? It's the one and only Legend of reggae! I grew up being a big fan, and this has all of my favorite songs and then some!
B00000G3PA|5.0|I don't think there's much to review here. If you like this movie and want a DVD then make the purchase.
B00C8RBP6Q|4.0|Creepy October Cinema continue apace, with Roman Polanski's THE NINTH GATE (Spain/France/USA-1999).<br />This occult mystery stars Johnny Depp as a rare book dealer, Frank Langella as a collector of antique Satanic literature and Lena Olin as a woman of many unusual powers, such as an ability to float through the air. (Small supporting roles for James Russo and Allan Garfield.)<br /><br />Depp is sent to Europe by Langella to investigate the authenticity of two of the only three copies of an 18th Century Latin text written by a man who was burned as a witch for consorting with Lucifer in the book's creation. Olin keeps appearing in his travels and acts as Depp's \\"guardian angel,\\" shielding him from violence.<br /><br />Don't miss that climactic scene of evil incarnate: naked Olin copulating<br />with Depp as the St. Martin castle goes up in flames behind them!<br />(NOTE: Not all DVD copies have this essential sequence.)
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Pretty good show.  I think Walt is the best kinda worried about the cow.  Hopefully the next season will be just as good.
B00FE0FO7U|2.0|Wish I could return it. Not that great of a cd. Disappointing. Songs that are released are the best ones.
B002SR2PKG|3.0|This novel went into a little more of the Stephen King &#34;darkness&#34; than I would've liked. A couple of instances I had to put the book down because I could not believe what I was reading. A little too disturbing for me.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|I downloaded this book minutes after midnight on its first day, and 14 hrs later I have finished it cover to cover. I have been married to a Pakistani for 14 yrs, and have repeatedly asked my husband, &#34;Why do the Pakistanis put up with this&#34;...or that as situations have arisen over the yrs. The best answers I have gotten are the same mentioned in this book. Corruption & fear. It is so wonderful to see a father & his daughter take a stand for their right for something as simple as going to school that so many of us take for granted every day.<br />Although I have never been to any of the 'villages' I have visited Pakistan once & was a bit surprised by the conditions in one of the larger cities. The Swat valley does sound beautiful thanks to the wonderful mental pictures I got from the very vivid text. It really is ashame that this area is no longer available for tourist, be they Pakistani or international. I also accompanied an in-law to a doctor's while in Pakistan, and as a retired RN, I am really amazed that Malala survived this ordeal. I have little doubt that it definitely was not her time to die no matter what the Taliban tried. God....Allah....must have other plans and no man will change that.
B00ARF93AQ|1.0|It was too violent and it was boring.  I didn't care about any of the characters.  I don't expect much from this type of action movie, but I didn't even finish it.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|While this film wasn't perfect, especially the ludicrous and unsatisfying third act, it was still an exciting world-wide zombie disaster movie. Think Roland Emmerich, only good. But if you've read the book, which I highly recommend, you might be disappointed with the complete disregard for the source material.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Very creative and scary show.  The fact that they can show some of the things they do on tv amazes me.
B009LDCZDC|5.0|Suspense, tight story writing, lots of talent behind and in front of the camera.  Thrilling highs, crushing lows, twists that pull you in ever deeper...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome game challenges hand eye coordination. able to reach some goals with out funds. Super fun super fast and super hard at times but lots of good clean fun for any age and skill level could do with more ways to earn coins.
030758836X|5.0|\\"Friends see most of each other's flaws. Spouses see every awful last bit.\\"<br /><br />Nick Dunne comes home to find his wife, Amy Elliott Dunne, is missing.  As the police begin the investigation, it looks more and more like Nick killed his wife - but Nick insists he's innocent.  Who is right and what happened to Amy?<br /><br />When a book was on a New York Times Bestseller's list, I used to assume that meant the book was good.  \\"Used to\\" meaning, until I read some of these \\"bestsellers\\" and realized that just because they sell well, doesn't mean they are \\"good books\\".  So now, I pretty much avoid anything on the Bestseller's shelf (unless it is a Star Wars book or Neil Gaiman).<br /><br />By this thought process, this book should never have gotten into my hands.  But I kept seeing all these good reviews, and I'm addicted to buying books, so I broke down and bought it.  But it might have stayed on my shelf for a few more months/years if it had not been for a friend's review.<br /><br />You see, I've also been in a bit of a reading slump.  Or should I say, I'm gradually coming OUT of a reading slump.  Back in the spring, one more crappy YA faux-topia made me despair of my love of reading and want to throw in the towel on my passion.  Slowly, I've been finding books that make me love to read again - Neil Gaiman, Robert Galbraith/JK Rowling.  And I can add a new one to the list: Gillian Flynn.<br /><br />I've gone back and forth whether I'm a mystery/thriller girl - this book finally proves that I DO like mystery/thrillers, just not the s***** \\"dime a dozen\\" murder-by-numbers novels that seem to populate most of the Bestseller lists (coincidence?!  I just finished reading Dan Brown, so definitely NOT!).  Flynn is plain stunning; she has a complex story but tells it in a way that doesn't require 3 chapters of \\"And This Is How The Bad Guy Did This\\".  Flynn doesn't write down to me; she treats me like an adult, able to put two and two together (or if I'm too dense and can't, that's my fault, not hers).<br /><br />The story centers on Nick and Amy, two of the worst people you will ever meet in your life.  Nick is a self-centered, arrogant pr!ck; Amy is a self-centered, vindictive b!tch.  Nick likes to think he's so amazing and hot s***; Amy *is* Amazing, as the star of her parents' Amazing Amy children's book series, and pretty much believes the world should revolve around her.  Honestly, these people are so execrable, I wanted to scratch their eyes out (though I liked Amy in the beginning and started to like Nick a bit more in the end).  THIS is a PRIME EXAMPLE of how to write awful, unlikable main characters and STILL make your story interesting enough that the audience is engaged.<br /><br />The other characters are equally well-drawn, from Nick's twin sister, Margo \\"Go\\" to Amy's clingy parents to Amy's creepy old friends.  I am reminded of JK Rowling's adult books - the characters are sometimes sleazy, sometimes good, sometimes bad, but all realistic and with their own motivations.<br /><br />What makes this even more fun is that I've almost come to expect bad characterization in mysteries and thrillers.  It's more about the whodunnit, right?  So who cares who the characters are - make them as stereotypical or cliched as you want, and people will still read for the mystery.  So it really makes me giddy excited that Flynn spent so much time on such great characters.<br /><br />But the real artwork is in the story.  Oh, the story!  The first half takes you down one path - poor, abused Amy!  What a wretched husband Nick is!  And then at about the halfway point - mindf@#$!!  I can't really say much without going into spoiler territory (and I won't do that, no worries), but I was stunned.  It threw me for a loop - though maybe, given how dense I can be, you shouldn't take my word for it!  Regardless, I thought it clever, and the ending is definitely not what you would expect, though I was VERY satisfied with it.  (Thank GOD it's notone of those awful \\"and they lived happily ever after\\" atrocious things.)<br /><br />To round things out, Flynn's writing was excellent.  Again, works by Dan Brown and Nicholas Sparks made me realize that popular novel's writing only had to be at about a 4th grade reading level and very prosaic at that.  While Flynn isn't super flowery or literary, it's still very nice to read, easy on the eyes.  And when she DOES use descriptors and metaphors, they A) make sense and B) actually give depth to the characters and the situation.<br /><br />You know what?  I was going to rate this 4 stars, but I've decided I'm not.  I really liked this book.  I really enjoyed the mystery, the psychological thriller aspects.  Yes, the characters are awful.  Yes, the story is what you might expect two awful characters to produce.  And yes, there is rape (or lots of rape accusations) and murder and slut-shaming (so warning for people who don't want to read that).  But it kept my interest (with the exception of two places early in the novel) and, more importantly, made me realize that I shouldn't just assume ALL mysteries and thrillers are like the schlock I've read.  There ARE amazing, suspenseful authors out there - you just won't necessarily find them on the NYT Bestseller's List.  (Though in this case, I did!)<br /><br />Gillian Flynn, thank you for a great book, thank you for helping me out of my slump, and thank you for saving your genre!  I can't wait to read more of your works!<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S. Light*one of those awful \\"and they lived happily ever after\\" atrocious things.)<br /><br />To round things out, Flynn's writing was excellent.

I was going to rate this 4 stars, but I've decided I'm not.  I really liked this book.  I really enjoyed the mystery, the psychological thriller aspects.  Yes, the characters are awful.  Yes, the story is what you might expect two awful characters to produce.  And yes, there is rape (or lots of rape accusations) and murder and slut-shaming (so warning for people who don't want to read that).  But it kept my interest (with the exception of two places early in the novel) and, more importantly, made me realize that I shouldn't just assume ALL mysteries and thrillers are like the schlock I've read.  There ARE amazing, suspenseful authors out there - you just won't necessarily find them on the NYT Bestseller's List.  (Though in this case, I did!)<br /><br />Gillian Flynn, thank you for a great book, thank you for helping me out of my slump, and thank you for saving your genre!  I can't wait to read more of your works!<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S. Light*
B00F4KGJRO|5.0|Thi has to be one of my favorite Alan Jackson albums. If you like bluegrass, I would defenantly recommend this album.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was literally intoxicating and I did not want it to end this way. I wanted for both of them to get back together and Christian to realize he did not need to be this way. Jsingle937@optonline
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie and Despicable Me 2 are the funniest movies I have seen in a very long time.  It should be viewed whenever laughter has been gone from your life for more than 24 hours!  Watch it, enjoy it, love it and renew the giggles that are hiding inside.  The minions are amazing.
B009AY04A8|5.0|First your drawn in by this mysterious box. You know that its going to be a search and find game but more importantly it has an intriguing story that draws you in.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|This game is very attention grabbing for my 8 year daughter.  It doesn't get boring like other games.  She's been playing on it much longer than any other game to date - except a drawing app.  Good job!!
1563890119|4.0|The first volume of the sandman series is rather straight forward and a little rough around the edges compared to the later chapters. These truths do not change the fact that preludes and nocturnes is a classic, and lays the groundwork for the rest of the series.
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|It took me awhile to get in to the book. But even after I was staring to learn about the characters, the book did not have a smooth feel to it. Not certain if it was the French, or the time lines. I do not believe that I will read the next book in the series.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Probably the best game ever. I play it all the time and have built many things including a pirate ship. I advise getting PocketIVeditor, you can editor your inventory and a whole bunch of other stuff. I would rate it 6 stars if I could.<br />A MUST NEED!!
B003730LRY|4.0|The hilarious relationship between Raul Julia and Angelina Houston is a howl. The entire family's bizarre approach to day-to-day life is a consistent source of amusement, though I'm not really a big fan of either &#34;It&#34; or &#34;Hand&#34;.
0071766588|4.0|you must  buy it if you want to take TOEFL Test.<br />The paper of this book looks not as good as GRE Official Guide, probably  because of its acid-free paper .
0937381888|4.0|Good info, easy to read. Usable for a wide range of brewer skill. Written so the average guy can understand it.
B002RMVAZ8|4.0|Hamlet is classic take on a timeless take. Its a movie to watch again and again. I really enjoy this tale.
140006922X|5.0|This is an excellent overview of the scholarly works that show that Jesus was one of many radical Jewish preachers running around the Middle East about 2,000 years ago.  His true (as true as can be established by historical scholarship) story is far more interesting than the mythical tales from the Bible.  When you see him as the human he was and understand the times in which he lived, we can relate to his story.  This book is very much in the vein of Lies My Teacher Told Me by James W. Loewen - it brings history to life and shows that the people that lived that history were no different than the rest of us.  This is what brings history alive and makes it fascinating<br /><br />Aslan writes in an easy to read style that is informative and engaging, making it a quick read.  The notes at the end of the book contain more scholarly information and are nearly as interesting as the main text.  It would have helped if he had footnoted the main text to refer the reader to these notes but this is a minor flaw.  This is a book that everyone should read.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read! They keep throwing new things at us that you would NEVER expect.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I watched the movie first, and I was surprised that they were able to embody so  much of the book in a film. I love the way Mitchell approached this.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|First few times it worked great.  Now takes forever or never loads a clip.  I have removed it off of my Kindle Fire HD device.  Where can I find a real You tube app?
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Love Gaiman, this was a great read, I got so caught up, I was quite disappointed that the story ended so soon.
B009VIZDLI|3.0|I finished the book but I didn't feel as if I had lost friends as I often do when I finish a good book.
B001QL5MAA|4.0|These are just good straight up sci fi reads. He balances everything really well and keeps it interesting, I am working my way through his stuff.
B00C5R8364|4.0|I have been reading Forsyth novels for a few decades and this book does not disappoint.  It's well written and a real page turner.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|I am a die hard lover of the original Star Trek movies and series so I was prepared to dislike this movie.  On the contrary, I found that I did enjoy it. The actors they chose I felt for the most part were very fitting to the roles and did a good job.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|There are substantial differences between the Netflix streaming show and the book on which its based, with the show being more dramatic. That said I wholeheartedly recommend this show! Great characterizations and a hypnotic quality that draws you in slowly and engrosses you as learn more about each inmate's backstory. Very well done.
B00FGEO9NE|4.0|******Spoiler Alert********<br /><br />  Revised December 16,2013<br /><br />  It was rough getting through the first 3 boring episodes of the season, then the writers and producer (Claire Danes BTW) kicked it up several notches with the plot to get inside Iran. The rest was as good as any spy thriller gets. The ending is surprising but well thought out and essentially completes the story. The ending seemed to be a closure for the stories of the main characters, with no cliff hanger.<br />  There were some distinct plot holes including why the Iranian forces didn't shoot Carrie on the spot, and how the Iranians would explain why their hero Brody would assassinate the head of the Revolutionary guard without suspecting a CIA setup. Also, why would Carrie, the loose cannon, be promoted to Bureau chief in a sensitive location,after her employers locked her up in a mental institution and later on had her shot on orders?  From their perspective, she would have  to be seen as unstable and untrustworthy.  Anyhow, the series could be complete here, and a fourth season would just be jumping the shark.
B00ARF92HK|1.0|Worse than the first judge dredd.  I didn't think they could do it any worse.  Good thing I didn't pay money to see it in a theater.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It is easy to use  it helps me decide what to expect on the weekend i dont get how to use the gift points
B00985E3UG|5.0|Michael Moss does an outstanding job of laying out the history of food manufacturing. He explains how we got to where we are and why we are where we are. The drive for profit has completely overwhelmed the morality of producing healthy food. Food manufacturers have studied eating habits, food and physiology, food and psychology and used science against the American public to sell more salty, sugary and fatter foods driving Americans into obesity and type II diabetes.<br /><br />This book is an eye opener for everyone who wants to eat healthy and doesn't realize how deceptive food manufacturers have been. For those who already suspect food manufacturers this is the book that confirms everything you suspected.<br /><br />It is an easy read (you don't need a degree to understand it) and yet it is a hard read because it is hard to accept that the food manufacturing industries have been so devious and careless about the health of Americans.<br /><br />For those who have food allergies, food addictions and other health issues related to food this is a must read.
B00EMAGCJM|4.0|I'm in my mid twenties so no I did not grow up with Miley as my idol but like the rest of the world I was curious if she'd put her money where her mouth is with this album and I think for the most part she did. Love or hate her this album is a very fun listen. I'm kinda embarrassed by how many times Bangerz has been on repeat on my kindle since I downloaded this album. The big standout song for me is FU. I didn't realize Miley had those kinds of vocal chops but she sings her butt off in that song and sings very well I might add. I have no bone to pick with Miley Cyrus' s new image and sound. I say let the girl have her fun and I'll continue having fun listening to and dancing to this party blast of a pop album.
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|Miley is doing what just about any other big pop artist has done..court controversy.  It's fine and helps her stay in the public eye and get more hits and clicks which result in record sales.  I personally dont really care what artists do in their private time or who they sleep with or who they are fighting with.  I love music and I love hearing what all types of artists are working on.<br /><br />With that said, if you are not a Miley fan because of her performance controversies, her personal issues, Sinead drama, I say take a chance and just listen to the album.<br /><br />My favorite tracks on the album include the second single, Wrecking Ball which is just such a mesmerizing ballad and shocks me everytime when I think it was written by such a young person.  \\"Someone Else\\" reminds of tracks from Alphabeats album \\"The Spell\\" which is a compliment and another album I highly recommend.  The opening track is actually my favorite track on the album, \\"Adore You\\"  It's a beautiful mid-tempo and really well done lush ballad. Highly Recommended!  While I dont love the Britney collaboration, SMS, I will say that \\"#GETITRIGHT\\" sounds like a funky, less sexual sister to Britney's early 2000's classic, \\"Slave 4 U.\\"  \\"Rooting for My Baby\\" reminds me of 80's Fleetwood Mac and though not my favorite, shows what a versatile artist Miley is.<br /><br />Surprised that there were as many ballads as there were though they ended up being my faves.  There were quite a few dance-floor cuts that remind me of the Rihanna \\"Pour it Up\\" \\"Birthday Cake\\" sound.<br /><br />Here are the writers/producers she worked with on each track:<br /><br />\\"Adore You\\" - Stacy Barthe, Oren Yoel<br /><br />\\"We Can't Stop\\" - Miley Cyrus, Michael L. Williams II, Pierre Ramon Slaughter, Timothy Thomas, Theron Thomas, Douglas Davis, Ricky Walters, Mike Will Made It, P-Nasty, Rock City<br /><br />\\"SMS (Bangerz)\\" (featuring Britney Spears) - Cyrus, Williams II, Marquel Middlebrooks, Sean Garrett, Made It, Marz<br />\\"4×4\\" (featuring Nelly) - Cyrus, Pharrell Williams, Cornell Hayes Jr.<br /><br />\\"My Darlin'\\" (featuring Future) - Cyrus, Williams II, Slaughter, Nayvadius Wilburn, Jeremih Felton, Jerry Leiber, Mike Stoller, Ben E.

B00A285OOW|4.0|One of philippa's best. This book is fascinating from a very personal perspective narrated by elizabeth, daughter of Edward and mistress of Richard, her uncle and king of England as well. What a fascinating and excruciating life!
B00005N6KG|1.0|Sony stopped making them so retailers jacked the price up, knowing they are limited now. Beware of the deals on eBay as those are Chinese knockoffs, note the \\"no packaging\\" you'll get on those deals.<br /><br />It's a shame Sony quit making these to focus on ear buds...Oh well...
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Great movie love the action sequences and the acting was very good.  Found that the extras are a good bonus as well.
B003QSOFFO|5.0|Wonderful heart warming movie. Definitely recommend it for children and classrooms to teach cultural diversity. The animation and musical selections were wonderful for any age.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Has the essentials with a background to match what's recorded.  It's even pretty. Just don't expect it to sing for you. Well worth the $1.
B000MD7OKY|4.0|Cary Grant was as good as he gets in this. Grace Kelly was pablum. She went through the motions and was not engaged in the moment. Good story with good cinematography.
B00FHTV8B4|5.0|There are some really good songs on this album. I've listened to it at least 5 times through. Although skip \\"never never\\" like every time. The 10 remaining are so good. Even when lyrics might be cheesy, the rest of the music makes up for it. This is a heavy heavy album. I smile on some of the songs as some guitar riffs are just so great. Great to have Brian back in the band. You can tell. Going to see them live in a month. Pretty excited.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|this book is just like where they make you cry...but not me. problem? dialogue. its all wrong. Gus and Hazel dont talk like regular teenagers. parents dont talk like teenagers. another problem. plot. is the plot about fighting cancer? traveling to find an author? then what?<br />well that is all
B0063IH60K|2.0|When I first put this game on my tablet I really enjoyed it.  Now it wants me to be logged onto my Amazon account to be able to use it.  Not sure why.  I enjoyed the way it operated as far as the actual playing of the game.
0810994739|5.0|Daughter loves it!  She reads it endlessly over and over.  She has the entire set.  She is 10 and loves to read.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app makes it easy to rent e-books from my local library and it operates very smoothly.  Almost as good as my mother's kindle at a much smaller price.  Also will sync up with my smartphone and my laptop so I can read on any of them.
1419705849|5.0|Daughter loves it!  She reads it endlessly over and over.  She has the entire set.  She is 10 and loves to read.
0451232852|4.0|Book is excellent....print was too small,for this seeing eyed reader...make  sure the book you order has larger print!!!!!  You won't be sorry
B009PMEEY2|5.0|I like match three games that let you enjoy the experience without being so complex that it takes a lot of effort and concentration to solve them. Although this game is timed, which I normally don't like, It's easy enough with just enough challenge to be fun. It fits nicely on my Samsung SPH-710.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|I somewhat &#34;enjoyed&#34; this movie.  Overall story line was a bit confusing, but I got the &#34;jist&#34; of it.  Very thought provoking to say the least. If you're the type for deep thought provoking movies that will end up in a random conversation of, &#34;Hey, Betty what was your thought about the symbolism behind this and yadda yadda yadda over a cup o' Joe, then maybe you were destined for this movie.  I'm just glad that I got refunded due to poor viewing quality.  Maybe the movie itself second guessed it's worthiness?
B007AL48UK|5.0|If you like Mahjong this game is a great way to distract yourself when you need a break. Hints are available as needed to keep the frustration level under control. Works well on my Samsung SPH-710.
1932100660|1.0|The china study is primarily an epidemiologic study.  As such, it is really not possible to draw conclusions regarding cause and effect.<br />I was disappointed in the lack of reliability and validity of the various studies due to small study samples and lack of variable control.  You can draw conclusions about trends, but not direct causes of disease from this.  These scientists should know better.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The series held my interest.  It has a good mix of good/bad, the actors connections are being discovered.  All of the characters have a past!
B0093LINT2|4.0|Cute little box.  Add Usata drive, memory AND a power chord.  This device's power supply does not come with the chord to AC.  I guess it is a worldwide product.  There is a little note in there telling you to buy one based on your location.  Could they not have put the 2 different chords in there for you to choose?  Thanks Intel.  The D6 cloverleaf chord needed is quite rare, I had to order one.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|The characters personalities continue to develop as they play a little dirty.  Harvey likes to win!  The cast is sharp and beautiful, and so are the characters they play.
B007SGM084|1.0|I'm not to impressed so far as I am only 1/2  way thru the book.It's taking me so long because I find it boring & very juvinial.I don't know why I bought the trilogy!Anyway since I've paid for the trilogy I will read it.Maybe the second 1/2 will be more interesting..
1584282584|5.0|It's not a thick book, but it contains all the good information from the author's experience to help me improve on the use of on camera flash. I really like his no nonsense writing style. Very concise and very readable.
B008PNBU30|4.0|Sounds like Three Days Grace are starting to mature.  Can you say power ballad?  Can't beat it for the price.
0446581348|5.0|It the perfect makeup guide for everyone who love makeup. It's simple and step by step. I like it very much!!
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|A couple of duds .... but most of it is great.  It sounds like his late 80's / early 90's style songs.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Cant give it 5 star because its very limited as to what can be done with it right now. Also if your on external speakers HDMI you have to shut them off and use internal ones. Right now its an inexpensive toy that doesn't have the same power results of the apps built into your tv . But as a gamer Im always looking to try new things. This gadget needs work to make it ready for prime time.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|I read Tim's first book and thought it was excellent, this book is equally as good. This is the ultimate reference book for the body. Tim does such awesome and detailed research and then becomes his own guinea pig so he really puts his money where his mouth is and does it with such conviction and passion. Some of thus I would never try, but on the flipside, some of this I implemented immediately and am seeing immediate results. This book is a must read over and over for anyone wanting to be better than they are. Thank you Tim.
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|It could have been worse, but it's not a movie that I would recommend. The ending was really flat. Not worth the time.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Fun little app. A good way to pass the time. Hard enough to make your brain work, but easy enough to casually breeze through most of the puzzles.
B001K3KK0Q|3.0|It was an okay movie - needless to say, the book is much better. It is not worth the time.
B001VQB25E|5.0|I'm 5' 10' 155 lbs. fit was perfect. I used these bibs on a 140 mile race, very comfortable. I would recommend them.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Interesting storytelling.  Much better than the abomination that was passed off as the movie. Maybe the sequel will get it right.
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|Each time they come out with a new CD or members ep I think, this can't be better than the last one. They just keep putting out better and better music. They're so phenomenal. Fantastic CD. :D
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This App is extremely easy to use. ONE of the best free apps available. I have this on all my devices.
B007HXL1V0|5.0|Many practical ideas to try.  Lots of examples of why children do what they do.  I've tried several things with my grandchildren and they really work.  (most of the time)
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I loved this movie. I did not expect the ending and it brought the subject of addiction<br />in general and addiction problems in the airline industry to light in a fairly realistic way both in how it is generally blown off and blamed on others.<br /><br />Watch it, its worth the time.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I bought this app after having downloaded and really liking the free version. It's never been glitchy or not open properly for me. It gives the weather, a forecast for the week, and even the wind speed and direction all with really beautiful graphics. Great weather app! :)
B002PEP4SC|3.0|Unfortunately once you have watched Castle on TV, it is hard to go back to read this because you picture the characters in the book to be the ones in the show and<br />they don't quite work.<br /><br />It may be a good book on its own merit but I found myself  comparing it to the TV show and I then couldnt really enjoy the book. I think if I had found this series of books ( or if they had been out before the show came along) they may have been good to read 1st.<br /><br />So my summary is, if you have not followed the TV Castle show, you will like the books. If you are an avid fan of Castle, you probably won't like the books as much.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|So take this review with a grain of salt if you are a Neil Gaiman fan.  I thought the book was good while I was reading it.  It was pretty exciting, the story moved along fast, I kept finding myself wanting to get to the end so I could make sense of everything, so I really pushed myself through the reading of it quickly.  (It's a quick read.)  But charater development wasn't there.  Like he ran out of steam to really tell the story and therefore it felt like there were big sections of the story missing (and some where too overdeveloped) and in the end, the conclusion of the story, the pay-off, felt wrapped up really quickly and flat.  I don't want to share any spoilers, but I was disappointed.  For that reason I have to give it an okay.  However the book was good enough that this experience certainly wouldn't deter me from trying another of Mr. Gaiman's books.
B00BI6SSMC|5.0|i am so pleased with the entire cd.  no duds! if you like Women you will really love this one.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Worth the watch, a good cast & special effects.. A true magic show & performance. Must see, not bad at sll
B001EBV0OY|5.0|This movie is exceptional for its screenplay, the acting, and the storyline.  Each detail of the film is presented with care and sensitivity.  Even the musical background and selections throughout the film move the storyline along to the fantastic conclusion.
B00FEN000S|5.0|I thought it was impossible to relive the simple enjoyment I had as a kid/teenager when watching movies such as Ghostbusters, Independence Day, Jurassic Park etc, but Pacific Rim proved me wrong.<br /><br />Bombastic, fun and brilliant.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|Huge improvement in picture quality over the original DVDs. Some parts almost seem like they've been shot all over because so much nore is visible in scenes
B00FEHXISA|1.0|BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<br />GET OFF THE STAGE<br />[Throws Tomatoes]<br />Boooooo you suck Iron Man 3. Someone punch Paltrow in the stomach quick
B00DZAWPNM|4.0|OK guys, a few days later and 20 listens afterwards I am editing my review.<br /><br />I will give them one more star (from 3 to 4).  I am now in love with the album after multiple times listening through.<br />I found out that target has a limited edition CD with two extra songs. So, you guessed it, I went out and bought it! The 2 extra songs are pretty good and I'm happy to support P!ATD.<br /><br />If you don't like the album, listen to it in it's entirety a few times.. Yeah I'm addicted.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW___________________<br /><br />It's ok but I miss the old complicated lyrics and unique rock sound.<br />I am giving this item 3 stars because I love amazon autorip. I bought the physical CD and was able to download the MP3 instantly.<br /><br />I have been a devoted fan since the first album.<br />The second album kept me entertained.<br />The third album sat in my CD player for a few weeks.<br />This album is ok but I feel cheated.  The album is only 33 minutes long?!  Who makes a 33 minute album?  Can't you fill it with something?<br /><br />Gospel, Miss jackson, vegas lights and Nicotine are my fav songs.. Everything else sounds like it belongs in the 70's/80's.<br />I MISS THE INTELLIGENT LYRICS!
B00F35BV64|3.0|I enjoy the Star Trek series as much as anyone,<br />and this one is filled with a lot of action and<br />good visuals. Somewhat hard to believe in places<br />but still good all the same.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|i have the skullcandy - skullcrushers....a great headphones, but lacked a little power in the volume department.<br />thought of getting this little baby, i looked at the headphones amps for a while...i decided not to go with the cheapest (god knows what it would be like!) and also not with the most expensive one ('cause i never tried these things before) so i decided to go with this one...and i was really amazed, it made my headphones go to that extra step towards perfection.<br /><br />thanks guys for this little powerful thing :)
B002MUAJ2A|4.0|A very good book but sometimes they don't listen to their own advise and make things look black and white. As long as you don't get carried away the messages resonate.
B008I6ZX1E|5.0|I ordered this as a birthday present for a friend.  The seller was very accommodating with the delivery, and it arrived in plenty of time.  My friend &#34;loves this gift&#34;.  Thank you Pumpkin Patch of Lilly Street Books.
B009GEAPYW|4.0|This movie is very faithful to the comic book of the 1980's.  Good action and excellent drama.  I can't wait to see part 2.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|Watched the movie with my (adult) kids.  We all enjoyed it.  The characters are really great, as was the story.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|I first watched this through Netflix. It's really long and so I wasn't sure if I wanted to invest in the time. It was so worth it. After I watched it, I bought the DVD, the original book, and the sound track. I just love this movie so much. It made something click inside of me when I watched it. Most of my family has passed away, and I'm only 32. It provided great solace in that it approaches &#34;death as a door&#34; and focuses on how we are different people in different lifetimes--&#34;reincarnation&#34;. Even if you do not believe in reincarnation etc., it is a beautiful movie. Just amazing. There are so many different characters playing different roles, different races and genders. You will not recognize a lot of the actors at first! Really amazing make up in the movie and realistic effects.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|This is my favorite book. The story is delightful. Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are perfect together :) A true classic that you just can't beat!!!!

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I think just about anyone can enjoy these books. They are exciting, funny, and great for learning about the different Greek and Roman gods and goddesses. :)
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|as we all probably know every angry birds game except the first one used to cost money.right? well then  they made this game and its free version and all the other ones!!!
B002RKSZKI|5.0|This is one of my favorite books. I love the story of Emma and Mr. Knightley and could read it over and over and never get bored. Why can't you find books as good as this anymore?
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Absolutely the best light app ever! Simple, easy-to-use,  works perfectly. I tried sseveral other light apps which were complicated. This app is great.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|I went to see it in theaters, I'm completely amazed by how great it is.<br />I had to rent it to watch again, and to show my best friend when she came over.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|I was having a hard time when I first used this product, but I was jumping into it a bit fast and not really following the instructions specifically.  I burned through a bunch of test bottles while messing with pressure and temperatures.  After I re-read the instructions, applied firm pressure on my cut, and used the right temps to force a fracture, I have great results.  Definitely gets the job done.
B00EB6ENXO|4.0|Much darker and slower than the other two.  That been said I did enjoy it and will watch it a few more times.  The Agent Carter short was pretty good
B001TH16DI|4.0|I am a star trek junkie. I truly enjoy the interaction in this setting. I have seen better, and yet I really enjoyed this movie.
B00594XOZU|1.0|It wouldnt even let me set up my account! I put in my name and username and password but when i hit next it kept loading and loading.then it said &quot; this is taking longer  than expected. Plase try again later.&quot; or something like that.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|Great bible covers a great deal of info in detail<br />The study notes are very helpful they explain the verses<br />So you can understand them<br />Excellent app

B002RI98BA|5.0|Kearnes-Goodwin really brings Lincoln to life.  Her highly researched and heavily referenced work makes us feel we are actually there with Lincoln over the years leading to his first election and then until his end. . Perhaps unsurprisingly, she gives a fair bit of attention to the women around Lincoln's administration, not only to their thoughts revealed in their letters but also to their dresses, socialising and so on.  This does not distract from a very enjoyable book
B0094BB4TW|1.0|No news feed at all for me! Got a message on my Facebook that I had to update or I wouldn't be able to login. I really regret removing the old app. Now what am I gonna do?
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|Great action. Blows the first one with sorry Stallone away.  The slow motion effects were great and Karl Urban plays a great angry Dredd.
