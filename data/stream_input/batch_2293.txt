B007IXWL2C|4.0|I will have to say that each of the Fifty Shades book got a little bit better as far as the writing.  I struggled through the first one because it seemed to be written by someone in junior high school.  The books were definitely entertaining and edgey.  I enjoyed the Trilogy.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is addictive I play it all day and you will too enjoy it in the bathroom at the store in the car. Please play
B006LSZECO|5.0|One of the best books I had read in a very long time.  After reading this one, I searched for more by Gillian Flynn.

B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Sherlock is an entertaining flawed character.  Totally quirky and fun.  Watson's character could be a bit more rounded, but I'm guessing that'll come in the next season.  A fun show.

B00BSBY38A|5.0|I was absolutely enthralled watching this movie.  Not only was it visually stunning, the way it portrayed faith and the presence of God was inspiring.  Definitely one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|IT IS LIKE THE REAL THING BUT IS A LOWER UPDATE. SO FAR THERE ARE CREEPERS. SKELETANS. SPIDERS. ZOMBIES. SHEEP. PIGS. COWS.AND COWS...not to mention CRAFTING!!!!!!
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|whilst this movie didnt have a much of a storyline.. it did keep a smile on our face.. I love chic flix.. but have to say a couple of times throughout the movie, I found myself thinking.. what is the movie about? overall we watched it and had a few laughs.. not much more than that.. so if you feel like you need to put a smile on your face.. then this movie will probably do the trick..
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I'm only 10 but I'm hooked I like all of Ricks book series since I was about 7 Years old and I can't wait to visit Percy,Jason,or Kane no matter what. Bring it on Rick.... I'm ready. P.S. I miss Grover and Chiron. P.P.S. Gaea. Do. Your. Worst.

B001CTDH4Y|5.0|Amazon for DVDs is always a good choice.  As I have said before these DVDs are so inexpensive you can afford to get more.  Sometimes I don't get them right when they come out but I am very happy with my choices.

B005BZQVJ8|5.0|Kick butt!  Good road-trip Movie!  Great FanBoy movie.  All in all, a whip-ass, cuss-word drowned, crude, irreverent, funny display of being a bunch of dorks... with one who gets the girl
B009LGO88E|5.0|Very comfortable to hold in your hands. Works with North American 3DS XL models. It only costed me 4 dollars more for this circle pad pro XL compareded to what ebgames was selling the original circle pad pro. That's including the FREE shipping from another country. A very good deal. Product arrived a day before the estamated time. Product wrapped in cardboard and bubblewrapped all around. Very good precausions to ensure the product arrived in one piece. Somehow Canada gets the products comparably fast, even with the free shipping.

B007HC3LHS|4.0|A very well-constructed ,insightful book about personality disorder.  It weaves the past and present in a smooth and effortless fashion.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I have never read 5 books of this magnitude in such a short time. The characters, landscape, creatures and the twists and turns in an engrossing plot are all that a reader could hope for.  Just read 100 pages of the first book and like me you will be hooked for the full set!
0446691437|2.0|I wasn't really sure what to expect when I read this quick read of a book.  On the one hand, I appreciated the brevity and the candor, and on the other, the self-righteous overtones were alienating and borderline dictatorial.  I don't underestimate the work ethic and writing talent of Mr. Pressfield; however, if you are looking for practical approaches to consistently battling your bouts of procrastination and creative blocks without sacrificing the relationships that matter most in life (aka real friends and family), look elsewhere.  What makes this book borderline off-putting is that the three contemporary male figures noted for their \\"acts of commitment,\\" and are referenced more than once throughout, are all men that have failed their families and the public: Lance Armstrong, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Tiger Woods.  In addition, it is darn near impossible to find anything from Mr. Pressfield regarding his commitment to his family, (uncertain that he has one?), and overwhelmingly easy to find his thoughts on his commitment to being an artist, thriving as an artist, and loving an artist.  It is a bit tough to swallow the words of an artist when the word commitment only applies when it is to serve your advantage.
B008X6JP3G|5.0|I love Kevin Costner. He does a good job playing the good guy or is he really the good guy. Watch the movie and judge for yourself.
B00ANGSSWS|3.0|I heard this band on the radio and purchased this cd to see if I would like more than just that one song, and also because I wanted that one song. There were a few tracks that were just talking. In fact, at one point, at least three tracks in a row are just talking. The tracks that actually contained music were good, but I guess this kind of story telling album just wasn't what I expected.
B003NTSBUG|5.0|I enjoy a good a movie that keeps you on your toes. This one does and you are surprised at the ending.
B00BUL0XYG|5.0|Much better than I thought it was going to be. I'm a fan, but Angles wasn't that re playable to me. This CD is great!

B0018QQQK8|4.0|Great story. Nicholas Sparks is, as always very inspiring. Can't wait to read another inspiring story. He is one of my favorite authors.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I find that I'm pretty good at guessing plots and figuring out what the big secrets are, but I have to tell ya, this book had me thoroughly confused.<br /><br />Sky is a very sheltered girl. She has no internet, no computer, no television, no electronics at all in her house. Weird in this day and age? Maybe, but not impossible. She's been home schooled all her life and convinces her mom (adopted) to let her complete her last year of high school at a public school. What could go wrong right?<br /><br />Well really, what could go RIGHT? HELLO.<br /><br />Just before school starts, she meets Holder. For the life of me I couldn't figure out why this boy acted the way he acted, or why he blew up the way he blew up, and then I started to get some theories, and NOPE, I was completely wrong again! He has a tattoo on his arm that says \\"Hopeless\\" and when it was finally revealed what it meant, I felt that icy chill move up my chest. My mind started racing back through the whole story and putting all the pieces together and all his reactions in place and I just thought WOW. Great job Colleen Hoover! You managed to completely catch me off guard!<br /><br />This story touched me really deeply, and I was very surprised. I did not expect this at all from an author I never heard of, and thoroughly enjoyed it!

B00AMBH70S|1.0|I couldn't even finish this.  I love the first three Bourne films and this was more like Bourne 2.75. A lot of scenes from Bourne 3 mixed with new footage and new characters.  It was not for me.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|Is a very enjoyable game to play . I have spent hours playing. My grandchildren enjoy playing. I have most of their games and have enjoyed all and can't wait for more
B000FC1LOC|3.0|I am giving it 3 stars - felt the book was too long and too dragged out - I did not like the part of going back and forth in time - anyway - did not like the ending - very sad - I like good endings - I know this could have really happened in real life but this was a novel - anyway - that's my opinion.
1442337966|5.0|The Secret was just the tip of the iceburg. The Power is where it all is and ever will be. I couldn't put this book down. It is the sequel to The Secret. The book says it in the name The Power.
B00AV68GOA|4.0|I love this Downton Abbey - but am horrified that Matthew dies - now - heard he wants off the show.  He is in my opinion the #1 man in this show - I am hoping you will replace him with the same personality.  We need some happy scenes - so sad he died at the end of Season 3 - oh my - loved him - hopefully, something good will happen.  This is a very neat series - anyway, do something good to get Matthew back.  Thank you.
B002RXS1OK|4.0|Grand retelling of the old horror film classic. Frank Langella was the perfect Dracula, handsome and evil all wrapped up in a visually and musically (wonderful score) splended version. Lawrence Olivier over-acts a bit but everyone else handles their parts quite well.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I found it interesting but easy compared to some.  it was still enjoyable though.  Kids will like it and will be able to do it.<br />Had a bit of trouble downloading.  May have been my wiring.
034580404X|5.0|I LOVE IT!!!! The whole set was wonderful, it's a must read and intriguing from start to finish! I didn't want tot put it down.
B006CHML4I|5.0|I really like simple accessories, and this watch from Seiko is very simple yet elegant, as you can see from the pictures. The band is a little narrow for a men's watch, but it's perfect for me because I have a smaller than average wrist. The blue color is just perfect, conservative but not too dark that it still would grab some attention.<br /><br />The kinetic system works very well for me, especially because I wear this on a daily basis. I once left it in my drawer for 3 days, and it died, but after wearing it for about 30 minutes, it went back on, and I have to adjust the time, but it only takes 2 minutes to do so.<br /><br />Speaking of which, as noted by other reviews, this watch tends to run fast, gaining 2-3 minutes every week. What I usually do is to compare it with my cellphone clock on a set time (say, Sunday afternoon), and adjust accordingly. That way, the time wouldn't be too far off. (Besides, running fast is way better than running slow, because you would never be late because of the watch. But I'm still late for everything despite having this watch, sitting on my wrist as a silent witness to my tardiness.)<br /><br />Speaking of silence, the watch is pretty quiet, it has a noticeable clicking sound that you can hear only if you put the watch right next to your ear.<br /><br />And at $60, I think it's a steal! So don't hesitate and just order it!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|After watching the first season I am now hooked on The Walking Dead.  I purchased the 2nd season as soon as I finished the first
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Super awesome! So great that my kids love it! It is so awesome!  Really good! My kids can't ever get off of the game.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The emotion and power behind this book is amazing. The way it sucked me in and held my attention. Very powerful
B005S9EKCW|3.0|I went with my wife to watch this movie. My wife loves musicals, I like some musicals.<br />So this is my perspective.<br /><br />Of course the performances are excellent, except Russel Crowe who sounds like crap.<br /><br />But as a moderate musical fan, the fact that they have to sing every single line in the entire movie, is very tiring on my ears. I would have liked it a lot better if they took a break between singing and used regular dialog. The movie was very long so I had a headache after the first hour.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This book is for all the Mitch Rapp fans out there -- he is like a guided missile aimed at all American enemies
B00AHTYGRW|1.0|In my humble opinion this movie is boring, over dramatic, and poorly acted by Ben Affleck. Does Ben Affleck know how to play anyone else that himself. Every movie I've seen him in he has a different hair-do or outfit but he acts exactly the same. The movie is boring because if you paid attention in history class you already know the ending. Also, I don't feel sorry for the staff members staying in the Canadian Ambassador's house because they are sipping on wine, smoking cigars and lounging around. How are we supposed to relate or feel bad for these people?<br /><br />Why was this nominated and why did this win any awards?
B002WV5A9G|4.0|My wife and I introduced our teenagers to the Star Trek universe with this movie.  It provided the excitement and action that young viewers (and older) want as well as the backdrop of all the old favorite Star Trek personalities.  It was obvious that the producers worked hard to make a believable link between the original and new cast members.<br />Like:  The action mixed with humor linked to classic Star Trek.<br />Dislike:  It seems like they tried a little too hard to make Kirk a rebel.  It made me wonder how he could ever be an effective captain.  Also the alternate universe thing seems like the easy way out and now the link between old and new can be severed.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|Lincoln should have won more awards than it did.  However, as a history buff who enjoys a great movie, this was by far the best I have seen in years.  It was slitty embellished, but had a great story line.  It showed what Lincoln had to go through to emancipate<br />the slaves regardless of the consequent.
B000055Y0X|4.0|Dr. Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb was an enjoyable movie, one that was funny but also had a lot depth and meaning to all of it. Directed by Stanley Kubrick, this movie was satirical and played the ridiculousness of the whole Cold War. Since the movie was centered around the President trying to correct and undo the general's actions, who gave wrong orders for airplane bomb carriers to bomb Russia, the mood was always very light. It was shot in black and white and it was uniquely designed to alert us of the evil inside the Cold War but also to make us laugh in absurdity.<br /><br />Although fictional, many of the underlying themes that Kubrick depicted rings true to the Cold War and the society at that time. I thought Kubrick cleverly used themes such as fear of nuclear weapons, the self-destructive nature, paranoia to communism, gender imbalance, and fragmented governments to all point to the Cold War and its flaws.<br /><br />Fractured governments and the self-destructive nature of them are clearly shown in Dr. Strangelove. Throughout this movie, the President had no power over the situation and was not in control like he should've been. The general didn't even consult him when falsely ordering the planes to bomb Russia. Instead, he had an ambassador from Russia who later is revealed was really a spy and was taking secret pictures of the U.S. Pentagon. In addition to the powerless U.S. president, the drunken Soviet Premier had no idea what was going on and did not respond the way he was to respond. The fractured government has given rise to self-destructive nature that Kubrick illustrates. There was fighting in the Pentagon, suicide on General Ripper's part and even U.S. soldiers killing and shooting at other U.S. soldiers. This can be related to the Cold War because during the Vietnamese War, when Lyndon Johnson was still in presidency, Nixon secretly delayed the peace accord, causing more people to die and settled for worse termsfor the U.S. compared to Vietnam. The factions in the government created more problems which was played out in both the movie and in the Cold War.<br /><br />Another theme that was in the movie, which accurately portrays the situation during the Cold War, was the fear of nuclear weapons. In the Cold War, this was the arms race, where Soviet Russia and the United States would increase their technology in weaponry and nuclear bombs. This advancement was purely for security, to know that you have the better bomb than the other country so they won't attack. This went up to the extent of having no way in advancing their technology further. This situation was coined \\"MAD\\" or Mutually Assured Destruction. In Dr. Strangelove, Soviet's had a better bomb, called the \\"doomsday bomb\\". The Soviet's had it because they thought the Americans had one. General Turgidson comments: \\"Gee, I wish we had one of them doomsday machines\\", representing their paranoia of not having the best technology. Also, paranoia of communism is characterized as the paranoia of having a bomb drop in Russia, which would lead to a doomsday bomb detonation. The paranoia of communism can be seen in McCarthyism, the HUAC pursuit of spies and \\"duck and cover\\" while the paranoia in this movie can be seen in the posture of General Turgidson and the music and mood of the film, which was always on edge.<br /><br /> Gender imbalance was also a prominent theme in Dr. Strangelove. Throughout the entire movie, the only woman who appeared was the secretary of one of the generals. She was depicted as a sex object, with an outfit of a bikini and heels while tanning. Women were allowed voting rights only after 1920, when the Congress pass the bill. So it wasn't long ago that they were treated as real human beings and clearly some still had not made the transition. When the general spoke to the woman, he talked to her as if she were a child. They never respected them and only used them for pleasure. Even the number of women that appeared during this movie and the way men treated them should clearly reveal that Kubrick might have wanted to show the great gender imbalance during the Cold War.<br /><br />The only thing that I find flawed in this movie were the random scenes. After some research, I found out that he was supposed to add something at the end but was cut because Kubrick did not like it. The scenes that were supposed to lead to the end scene were not cut so don't be surprised if you didn't understand some scenes throughout the movie.<br /><br /> Despite this minor flow, all in all, I thought this movie was made really well and was quite hilarious with surprisingly a lot of hidden themes relating to the Cold War. There were some parts which were intriguing to see happen so subtly but I'm glad I caught them. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I won't mind watching it again!

B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was really well-written from a mentally ill character's point of view.  The childlike descriptions and the phrases used to disguise events that he was unable to face pictured his illness in a way a third person narrator would have been unable to do. The story line was adequate, but what was really outstanding for me was the character study and the insight to relationships as seen through the fog of mental illness.

1250007208|4.0|First off, let me say Cinder immensely surprised me. I would not have thought that I would like a Science fiction book with robots and cyborgs, but I loved it. In fact, it's better than the original Cinderella, which is retold in this stunning novel. Marissa Meyer has made an incredible world that you can feel like your living in through her words. I was staying up late and waking up early to read this riveting book. Cinder is a novel I could never forget.<br /><br />The characters of Cinder were all oh-so-similar to Cinderella's yet no where near the same. Cinder is a cyborg. Originally a human, Cinder was in a car accident that left her parents dead and herself wounded. Some of her limbs had to be converted into metal and wires, and on top of that, she was an orphan. Cinder never really wondered about her past; she's never been able to remember anything. Adopted by Garan Linh, she moved into a home with a loathing step-mother and two step-sisters, one friendly, one bitter. Garan soon dies from a spreading, incurable plague, leaving Cinder to Step-mother Adri. Her life quickly changes as she is forced to work in the town as a mechanic- the best one there is. So clever at her job, Prince Kai, the emperor of New Beijing's son, meets her by asking her to fix his own robot. With a heart-racing, gripping plot, Cinderella is reborn in an epic tale of world domination, sacrifice, forbidden love, and hidden secrets.<br /><br />Cinder is a must read for anybody. I am truly sorry for you if you haven't read this book because you are missing out. Cinder was a thrilling novel and thankfully there's more in the Lunar Chronicles. Thank the almighty Lord I found this book! - Bridget (4.5 stars)

1433502410|1.0|The contributors to this bible are white men, steeped in patriarchy, racism, and misogyny. The commentary is so white-washed, it's sickening. If you are a person of color or female, don't think these commentaries will affirm or acknowledge your right to be in the family of God.

B00005JLEU|4.0|It  should  be  noted  that  Ghibli  and  Miyazaki  and  Not  typical  animation  but  the  cream  of  the  crop .<br />Spirited  Away  is  very  very  active  so  I  recommend  watching  it  when  you  are  calm  so  you  can  take  it  all  in .<br />All  of  their  stories  are  complex  and  Not  like  standard  Saturday  morning  kid  fare .<br />Also ,  their  animation  is  far  superior  to  the  computer  generated  stuff .<br />The  grasses  moving  in  the  wind  or  cloud  movement  are  just  a  normal  part  of  the  fabulous  Studio Ghibli  work .
0316153834|5.0|The book is good if I didn't like Michael Connelly as an author I would not buy his books.  This review system you have is crazy.  Why not just use the star system.  That tells all

( grade school  age )<br />Unfortunately  she  watched  it  so  much  her  dad  tossed  it .<br />Kids  take  to  it  like  they  did  to  Never Ending Story .<br />As  an  adult ,  this  and  Porco  Rosso  are  rather  like  a  meditation  session .<br />They  relax  and  clear  the  mind .
B00AF6B22E|1.0|Spoiler Alert: Had potential until it became an afternoon school special. So the moral of the story is that it's okay to crash the plane (as every single other pilot did in simulation) as long as you're not an addict. Got it. He did what no other pilot could do, but let's crucify him since he's an addict. Great lesson to turn out more sheep. HATED IT!  Had the drunk drug addict NOT been piloting that flight that day, everyone on that flight would be dead.  For me, End of Story.<br /><br />Updated my review for clarification April 2, 2013:  My problem with this movie's message is...  Crucifying someone because they went to work drunk & high, eventhough they do a better job (are a better pilot) EVEN drunk & high than most, if not all others in any condition.<br /><br />I understand why we have these rules and limits, because MOST people cannot function well on diminished brain function.  However, here is a pilot that not only can, but did so stupendously.  Yet, we hang him out to dry for his drug & alcohol abuse, no matter how amazing of a job he did do while on it.<br /><br />We have gone so far overboard on watching and enforcing measuring sticks (limits), that we have lost sight of why we put those limits in place in the first place.  He landed the plane like no other pilot was able to in the simulations.  Honestly, that's all I need to know.  I don't care if he was drunk, high, blind or ANYTHING else.<br /><br />Think of it like this from a documentary I saw on aging:  There is this heart surgeon out there that is amazing in his field.  But he is forced to live a lie and hide something from his patients because of the stigma put on his affliction.  This surgeon's affliction is that he is 95 years old.  On the surface, who would want a 95 year old doing anything so important?  But he is the best at what he does, nothing else should matter.  Right?  Just a thought...<br /><br />And that also goes along with when we hear about a fatal car accident.  The penalty is greater if the person was DUI and then THAT becomes the focus.  Why?  DUI may be the reason they caused the accident, but the end result is the same - they killed someone.  End of story.  Again, we are paying so much attention to those aids we use to identify possible trouble spots that we can't see the forest for the trees.  If an inexperienced and reckless teenager had the same fatal car accident, but was sober, the end result is the same - at fault manslaughter.  We don't crucify the teenager for being reckless or stupid or inexperienced...and shouldn't.  Crucify him for killing somebody.  Judge the end result.  Rise above your emotions.<br /><br />Setting \\"standards\\" is an aid to help us make pre-determinations on what we can reasonably expect from most people / situations.  But those \\"standards\\" should be merely aids or tools and NOT the final word.eater if the person was DUI and then THAT becomes the focus.  Why?

B007BFSYMS|5.0|As a lite sleeper with teenagers I need something to drown out the gaming, etc.  I used an old air purifier for a long time, and I was considering purchasing a professional grade white noise machine.  I decided to try an app on my tablet, and I just saved myself 60bucks.  This puts out great sounds with the mixes.  The combined sounds are considerabley more relaxing than plain white noise.  I can plug my tablet to a set of PC speakers to get the volume level needed, and sleep peacefully.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Beautiful score and soothing background frame a challenging and fun game.  Well done.  Lots of levels and replay value.  Would buy again without question.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Very creatives and fast moving.  Brings out Jack Reacher's personality in an amazing manner.  Lays out how he came to leave the military and sets the stage for more adventures.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|I tried watching it in mixed company and ended shutting it off after about the first 15 minutes.<br /><br />When the rating is LSV, it means just that.  With it portraying one of our airline pilots as a drug addict and sex player using the profane language that a  normal household parent would never let their children speak, let alone listen too, I just had to shut it down.  My wife and two of my adult children were watching it with me and I was embarrassed at the very first scenes....Maybe if I had fast forwarded to the middle it have gotten better....I don't know.<br />I definitely do not recommend it as a family movie.
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|Good story, amazing technical accomplishment, lots of heart.  I expect the story to build and become more engaging with each episode. This one sets the stage well.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Very good story.  Moves at a good pace. The ending came as a surprise, but one that fits the overall context. I'd read move from this author.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have found so many neat ideas since staring pinterest. seriously where have you been all my life? ;) it is fun seeing what my other friends and family post. pinterest keeps us connected-kinda like facebook does.
1435106342|5.0|The book is beautiful. Great for the price. Equally as great as the Complete works of William Shakesphere.  Border leather bound Classics a must.
B00B9EQS98|5.0|Excellent cast, excellent storyline, wonderful 90 minutes of entertainment for the family!  I absolutely love this movie, as does my granddaughter!!!!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|The story was well written  I thought the way the dance was handled in the book was better than the movie.
B00AXVIBKW|5.0|Simply amazing!!! this record basically puts all of what Bad Religion is all about. Very classic feel with a new structure undertone. Love it!!
B004GXZ69W|3.0|First of all, this has 100% alleviated my carpal tunnel.  My wrist has never felt so good in my life.  And I was surprised at how incredibly fast I was used to the vertical mouse.  I have always used a regular mouse and had severe carpal tunnel symptoms.  Within the first hour I was gaming with this mouse and had no trouble getting used to the buttons or the movement.<br /><br />The only reason for the 3/5 stars is that the wire is way too thin and cheap.  After less than 6 months of use, my mouse stopped working today due to a disconnection between the USB and beginning of wire.  I have taped it but the tape won't keep it in place enough to use, it still continually disconnects.  Other than that, I have zero complaints about the mouse.
B001O1O71C|5.0|I'm a reader and this is the best book I have read so far.  Very touching story, sad as well.  Easy to read book, read it in less than a week!
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Not one for period pieces bit this show is awesome!! Modern day drama set in the past. I have since bought all 3 seasons
B009G8GRX6|3.0|I've bought tickets months in advance, stood outside for hours in the snow to make it to the front row in the pit, I can list off songs that can change my mood in a heartbeat and others that make me want to invest in $1000 headphones that block out everything else in the world. I am a Muse fan.<br /><br />So maybe I just set the bar too high. Maybe I shouldn't compare this to The Resistance or Absolution. But those two albums are what made me fall in love with Muse. The rocking, deep boom and electric riffs in those albums makes me want to hit the weight room and fall in love and start a revolution all at the same time. I like the question another review posed - \\"Is this the album you would want someone to hear if they were just being introduced to Muse?\\". The answer is a resounding and disheartening ABSOLUTELY NOT.<br /><br />Madness is fantastic. Baller. Killer. Whatever you want to call it. It starts out slow and by the end it grabs you by the collar and roughs you up a bit. Unfortunately, that is the ONLY track I could listen to on repeat. Everything else made me feel like I was watching a poor performance of the Rocky Horror Picture show. Underwater. And on drugs. Seriously, that is all I could think about. Rocky Horror Picture show. 2nd Law is way too operatic, too draggy, and frankly just lacks... muscle. There's nothing on this album that makes me feel strong and powerful and like a force to be reckoned with. It makes me feel weird and a little bit queasy.<br /><br />I tried to make it through the whole album from start to finish. I cut it off around track 5. And I keep it in my iTunes rotation with the hopes that something other than \\"Madness\\" will grow on me, or that I will change my mind. But every time it comes up in the rotation, I find myself skipping the track after a few long, drawn out bars. I'm disappointed not necessarily in MUSE, but in myself. I thought I could make myself like it, but I just can't. I feel like a terrible fan.
B00ABO609A|1.0|The movie did not hold my interest.  Even though I am a heterosexual, I consider myself open to other ways of expression love and intimacy.  That being said, this movie was slow and un-stimulating to the mind (my mind at least).
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|This is an amazing story that needed to be told I feel. I felt it was interesting to look at the events that led up to and during WWII from the average person's perspective which isn't often done. The combatants in the conflict are secondary which is quite refreshing. The author's voice fits this story perfectly as the tales winds on out and I am entranced with it. Being a historical fiction fan I look forward to reading more from this author. With as thoroughly researched as this book appears to be I'm sure I'll be missing out if I don't hunt up his books and read them.<br /><br />I was given a copy of this book for a fair review.
B0096HL33G|3.0|I believe we are relational people.  This movie explores a woman who cannot find a balance in what she wants, needs and her inability to effectively communicate in relationships.  This movie, although slow, captures the human struggle for intimacy and the potential emotional distress that could result.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|New storyline (at least to me) and not as one-sided as you would think.  Stresses individuality as a gift and the value of a life well-lived.
B003ZSISGM|3.0|I liked the book and would recommend the trilogy. It is a great summer time read at the cottage or on vacation.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|.It is an interesting story of second chances, with a little twist toward the end.  It was a nice break between some more intense and gripping novels, although it did keep me interested in what was going to happen.
B001POKBT0|3.0|This is almost what I was seeking but a little to overt for my taste. I wanted something more erotic and less deliberate. The performers are all of a body type to please the viewer who appreciates the upper body over the lower.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I'm still reading this, but thoroughly enjoying it.  Some of the details about the inner workings of federal criminal programs is fascinating.  They have me hooked and wondering what the characters are up to - can't wait to get it all sorted out!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Very predictable ending. Typical even. Wasn't so impressed but a good read.I was the author would have expanded her horizons when planning this book. She should have explored her options instead of bringing in old tricks to tie in the books.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Fun to play. Great for kids to. I enjoyed  the pace of the game and the hints when your stuck.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Love playing this game it keeps you thinking and moving fast Thanks for bringing to my kindle fire,Keep on bringing goods things Amazon.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I'm steal just getting the hang of it but I already can tell its a fun game and kind of addictive.
B00BPLDCVM|3.0|I love all the songs on the album, how ever most are only a minute or two long. Only problem I have with this soundtrack.
B003O86FMW|2.0|I was rather bored, as I found a lot of the plot repetitious of the Hunger Games.  It discouraged me to read the third one.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|It is a great series. I have throughtly emjoyed both the first and second seasons. Great acting and a great story. Hope to see more of this type of programming.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|The plot is very interesting and I love Ian McEwan's prose and sense of humor.  It is one of the more accessible of his novels.
B009LGO88E|5.0|Everything works wonderfully and the package was absolutely satisfactory! The written note was just icing on the cake!<br /><br />  Thanks a-million<br />  Arik H Yates
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|This movie is fantastic. Next time I don't think I will be pre ordering any movies without PRIME because I could have just got it at the store the day it came out cheaper. Oh well, still a great movie.
B005C8ENI0|5.0|Really enjoyed the movie.<br />Cool character lawyer and plot.  Mccaunahay did a good job.  I could watch this with my family.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Slow beginning but once you become familiar<br />With the characters<br /> The story moves right along. Don,t give up on the story.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|The planes are shooting each other, and you have a classical music in the background. Funny to me. I enjoyed playing it. It's very touch responsive on Kindle Fire, and Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  I played only a few level and enjoyed the game play so far. It's simple, and cute. Not too many buttons to press. The planes that has higher speed, makes me dizzy. It spins so fast, and moves so fast. I prefer the slower planes.  My 2 years old son love to crash the plane. Definitely worth 2.99 but I got it as free app of the day.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|That's what our kids say.  I read a chapter or two to the kids every night and they always beg to read one more.  We have been through the whole series this way.  They will make me keep re reading this one until the next book comes out.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|While the movie was entertaining, this book pulls you into the world of the Hunger Games completely. So much more than the movie was.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|I have loved this book for more than 50 years and it never gets old or outdated, which is remarkable for a science fiction story.
B00910Y1OQ|2.0|It will not download in my Kindle Fire HD. I've been trying for 2 days now. This problem need to be fixed since I paid for it.
B00B1ME3DQ|3.0|The beauty of Clutch is that they are completely capable of playing a tremendous variety of styles, change up the mood within a song, and then take back off.  Earth Rocker is however nothing out of the ordinary.  It sounds like Clutch, and it feels like Clutch, but it doesn't have any particular aspect that leaps out as being a great album.  If you are a Clutch fan then you'll enjoy the music because it sounds like Clutch.  If you dislike Clutch because of the seeming lack of variety in vocals or guitar, then you will not enjoy this album.  Clutch is the kind of band that makes you want to see live music.  This album is not bad but totally fails to capture the magic.<br />-- Updated 20140122 -- Went to see Clutch in Huntington, WV on 20140118.  Most of the show was Earth Rocker.  Clearly this album was written to be performed live.  (If you're going to do it do it live on stage)  Seeing it live really demonstrated how the songs were meant to be.  Still only giving the album 3 stars because the album, as previously stated, doesn't capture the magic of that live experience.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|one of my favorite movies, unfortunately it'll be in 3 segments. We watched it on prime and it was fine.
B004WR125O|1.0|Fortunately, the physical set-up meant I could run an ethernet cable from the router into the receiver.<br /><br />I tried to follow the v limited and non-intuitive instructions to link this, but no luck. Awful. Stay away.
B00846REIS|5.0|LIKE THEY SAY IF YOU LOVED FIFTY SHADES OF GREY YOU WILL LOVE BARED TO YOU. A BEAUTIFUL STORY LINE THAT HAS MUCH ACTION AND LOVE IN IT. ITS REALLY HARD TO PUT THE BOOK DOWN WHICH IS WHAT I LOVE MOST ABOUT IT. NOW ITS YOUR TURN SIT BACK AND ENJOY THE HELL OUT OF THIS BOOK!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I watched Downton Abbey Season 1 on Netflix.  Loved it.  Bought Season 2 on Amazon.  Loved it.  Just started watching Season 3.  Love it so far!  What makes me love it?  Most of the characters are sincere and know their limitations.  They know the difference between right and wrong, or if they are drawn to wrong, they realize it and return to the right side of life.  I appreciate that and would most definitely let my kids watch it (many shows they are restricted from)
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|I was unsure purchasing this game for such a high price because very rarely do you get the &quot;bang for your buck&quot;, but so far it's been worth it and I've just started! I don't want to give away too much, so I'll keep it simple---for every &quot;picture&quot; you enter there are several (&amp; I mean several) levels to complete. Very little jumping between scenes, easy to navigate and find the &quot;extras&quot;you will need throughout game. Scenes are incredible too! Awesome, realistic artistry. I've already played 4.99 worth and I've just begun. Seriously, you should buy this!
B004X75RK4|5.0|Interesting story with an enjoyable plot line.  Casting was great, too.  A nice feel-good romantic comedy or chick flick that everyone will enjoy.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Their once was a girl who loves pizza. And she ate it so much that she. Waite I want you to guess what happens next (you guess what happens next) OK so what happens next is that she turned into a new freshly baked pizza and she ate her self.<br /><br />  THE END
B004C3DLJS|5.0|True to form for Disney Pixar, this movie was great.  A continuation of the saga of the toys.  Not just recycled, but new story line and characters.  As usual, fun for all with adult humor skillfully woven in.
B0090SI460|5.0|Awesome! It Arrived in perfect condition! My husband really wanted it so I'm glad I could get it for him.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Our family enjoyed watching Glee on T.V.  This movie put is in mind of that series.  Funny characters and feel-good story.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|Spending around 22 hours to build this magnificant set was well worth the time and effort. A daunting task at first but as each level grew, the more amazing this thing became. Each scene was well put together and fun to play with. So many characters are included in this set (you get 3 Luke's) that it makes it more fun.<br />The price was the best compared to any other sellers online who would ship to Australia. (Buying it here would've cost me double!!) Shipping was really fast and came in great condition,my only problem was getting it inside as this set is so heavy! I can't wait to break it down and build it again... but not anytime soon!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Great movie for all ages with a life lesson attached.  Enjoyed the humor and animation was just super.  Sunday afternoon movie fun!
B00ADGSIRS|5.0|Karl Bartos one quarter of the classic Kraftwerk lineup has stepped back into his vault and pulled out some gems, sometimes they are part of a Kraftwerk song he developed, a lot of it is stuff he has done since then, but it is a remarkable debut album and I for one hopes he does a lot more in the near future!!!  If you are a Kraftwerk fan, don't miss this one!!!!
B00594XOZU|5.0|its cool AND DOSE NOT MESS UP OR LOG OFF AND I LOVE IT AND IT DOSE NOT DO  BAD THINGS
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A lot of people in my class play the game. It is very popular and very fun. It is a lot alike to a game called temple run. It&acute;s about a girl running away from a bear. Subway surfers is about some kids running away from a mean subway inspector. They are both very fun games. I recommend that you play the game. My sister begged my dad for subway surfers, and ever since, we have been playing.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|YOU WILL FREAK OUT WHEN YOU GET IT BECAUSE  YOU WILL LOVE THE DRAGONS AND DECERRATIONS AND IT IS ALSOME
1611748755|5.0|After a little slow start I found the story to be wonderful and the ending really surprised me.  The narrative put such a visually graphic view in my mind I felt like I was watching the story unfold.  I would recommend this to everyone just don't stop after the first 30 pages...keep reading as it is worth it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|IT IS FUN TO PLAY AND ENJOY IT EVEN IF IT SUCKS IT IS COLL AND ALSOME SO LOVE IT
B007QDNKQA|4.0|This movie was much better than I inspected, action from start to finish. If you like suspense you will like this movie as well.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Stolen!! The idea for this game has been stolen from the game series of temple run. If you like this game you will also love temple run. I like the game and i will continue to play it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I don't usually like endless runner type of games, but this one is great!  Great graphics, smooth gameplay and enough missions to make you keep going back for more!!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Love this game! I have lots of fun playing with friends, and getting all the wonderful colors only adds to the good time!
0316789798|5.0|This is a great fun little book for kids.  It does not teach you how to draw traditional animals, but the fun abstract ones the artist created.  5 stars for this nicely priced book.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Loved this book! I am now discussing deeper subjects with my dog. You do not have to be a racing fan to love this book ... just someone trying to get through Life as best he/she can.
B005VTS4EY|3.0|Really fun physics style game, but it get's hard fast.  It's worth the download though, this was one of the earlier physics based games.
B00BF11STU|1.0|The whole narrative is obscure to the point that the film is confusing and in the last half hour, pointless.  It seems to use this blurry mixture of Middle eastern names, army jargon, and  hand held cameras  to cover up the fact that the film is really a Hollywood “She just has a hunch, but it’s so crazy it just might work” scenario.  As for the torture as only being a part of the film; no, at least two hours of the film is about torture, or people sitting around complaining that they have no intelligence because can’t torture anyone once the Obama administration comes to power.  I found it to be thoroughly pro-torture because all the Americans (i,e, -the sympathetic characters in the film) are pro-torture, or torturers themselves.  However the part that completely lost me was the last half hour, the raid that ended with the killing of bin Laden.  Most of the time the screen is black, with no picture, except for the occasional flashes of night vision; it’s like listening to a radio show, only the show doesn’t make any sense.  I suppose it’s supposed to be “realistic,” but it comes off as more “indie” – if the Navy Seals had vision like this during the raid it would have been a dismal failure and they would have run into each other like The Three Stooges.  I thought the film was a pile of crap.
0307960471|5.0|Jo Nesbo has become one of my favorite authors and continues the Harry Hole series with Phantom.<br /><br />Before reading Phantom, I strongly suggest you start from the beginning of the series.  There is way too much backstory you don't want to miss.  Although, Nesbo does a good job of &#34;catching&#34; you up--I don't recomend starting hear.<br /><br />The series takes place in and around Olso and Nesbo has done such a good job, I feel like I have been there before.<br /><br />Hole is a unique, tough, funny character that I find it hard that everyone won't fall in love.  Some of the stories may be too dark and gritty for some, but not over-the-top in anyway.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great application I have always loved horses and this felt like I had owned a horse for a while I love this game
B008IYR2BA|5.0|True to past seasons of Dexter, this one did not disappoint.  A must buy if you have enjoyed Dexter in the past.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I am an ultimate Sherlock Holmes fan.  I thought there could never be a better Holmes than Robert Downey, Jr. I was wrong.  I stayed awake until the wee hours to watch this modern day Holmes with ALL of the flare and style that would make Sir Arthur C. Doyle beam.  I am so excited for Season 3!  If you like Holmes and Watson this will make you love them.  Oh, yes, seeing modern day Baker Street is beyond words, the photography is stunning.  Enjoy!
B004U8VWLE|5.0|Black Swan was excellent.  I felt like I watched a true Oscar winning performance.  It kept us on the edge of our seats, engaged us emotionally, and kept us talking about it afterwards.  Excellent movie.
B009NYU1CQ|3.0|Sandra Bullock can play all roes hilariously and effectively.<br />I think she's amazing in this movie.<br />The whole story is kind of ... could be better. I watched it<br />because of Sandra Bullock and really enjoyed her acting<br />as always.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This book is amazing it's like a movie! Everything is so vividly described!! There's a ton of action!! The plot is awesome!!
B00006I53S|5.0|I love my new lens, so far i have not had any problems with it, soon will be taking it to a digital class and hope to learn more..
B000005RUV|5.0|This has all of Wham!s hits on One CD .What more can I say.Some hits and misses.But it brings back the 80's fun side.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|I am happy that at least Apple created this converter so that I can get more use out of my older AC adapters. I have noticed quite a # of reviews that state the converter falls off but my experience has been great. The magnet is pretty strong and feels solid. I would highly recommend this converter if you have old AC adapters laying around.
B00871C09S|5.0|Absolutely one of my favorites. Alfred Hitchcock movies are by far some of the best classic films out there. If you enjoy Alfred Hitchcock movies and you haven't seen this one, it's something to put on your &#34;to do&#34; list.
B003R0MF1W|4.0|I caught a few repeat shows on cable TV. It was worth it to me to purchase the first few seasons and get caught up with the show.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I am always interested in reading about this part of history and appreciate the brutally honest portrayal of it in this novel.
B008R14YBK|5.0|I bought this for my daughter who is a fan of &#34;Good Luck Charlie&#34; and Lemonade Mouth which features Bridgit Mendler. Well, I heard this album and have found myself borrowing it from my daughter. A really good debut album where everyone of her songs is different yet catchy.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Would have liked to hear more of the inner feelings of the Mother.  Obviously, she felt her son committed the crime, but we never get to hear of her inner feelings.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|This double album includes all the songs we know from radio play on oldie stations plus a few more. I am enjoying the music.
1401230067|5.0|It is great, I love the old style of the novel. I like how dark and in a sense how it can be frightening in a way. Overall, excellent novel!
B003UPPO2G|5.0|I bought this to replace the VHS video tape we had. I would often play it while doing chores around the house. I really wasn't a fan until I first saw this televised show.
B00947N6UG|5.0|Overall I personally liked this movie a lot. Watched it with my 17-year old son and we both enjoyed it equally.<br /><br />Just feel that I should warn folks that maybe don't know that there's a bit of violence in it. No blood or gore of course, but Santa is walking around with 2 swords and \\"killing\\" scary horses made out of the stuff of nightmares, the Easter Bunny is doing the same with a boomerang and so on. It also touches a little bit on death in the story line, but I won't post a spoiler with the details.<br /><br />The gist of the story line is cute if a little formulaic. The boogeyman (named Pitch Black) is trying to get kids to not believe in the Guardians (Santa, Easter Bunny, Sandman and Tooth Fairy) by giving them nightmares. The Man in the Moon (or, as I see it, their representation of God) suggests that the Guardians let Jack Frost (a mischievous teenager who can fly, has various abilities around ice and cold and who has no idea of his past) join their team to help them. I'll outline the characters below so you can see how different they are from the norm:<br /><br />Santa is Russian and has tattoos on his arms (\\"Naughty\\" on one, \\"Nice\\" on the other). He also has Yeti working for him in the shops as well as elves (tiny critters who generally aren't as helpful as generally believed). Not your typical Santa as he's more of a \\"tough guy\\" but they do point out his gentle side and love for children and the \\"wonder\\" in all things.<br /><br />The Easter Bunny is over 6' tall and has a bit of an attitude. He travels by making magical tunnels in the ground that lead to wherever he wants. He wields a boomerang and has an Australian accent. He starts off the movie not liking the idea of having Jack Frost join them (thinks he's just a trouble maker).<br /><br />The Tooth Fairy is a bird-like woman who has thousands of little birds actually taking teeth and leaving rewards for children. These teeth hold the memories of the children in them so she safeguards them closely.<br /><br />The Sandman never actually talks, communicates with his ability to shape magic (sand/the stuff of dreams/whatever) into different forms. Like when he is curious about something, a question mark will form above his head, etc. Interesting character, probably my favorite of the Guardians.<br /><br />Jack Frost has a magical staff/stick that he uses to fly with and to shape/manipulate cold, ice, snow, etc. He likes to roam around and be mischievous, but he also has a strong love of children and enjoys giving them snow days, making their sled riding more fun and adventurous, etc. Nobody can see Jack Frost though, like they can see the other Guardians if they aren't careful.<br /><br />The Boogeyman (Pitch Black) is a tall, dark, brooding character that can manipulate children's dreams and make them nightmares. His arch-enemy, while he of course works against any of the Guardians) is clearly the Sandman for obvious reasons. His goal is to get children to stop believing in the Guardians because if nobody believes in them any more then they lose their powers.<br /><br />Overall the characters are well done and interesting, but quite different from the \\"norm\\" as you can see. If they weren't it wouldn't be a movie!<br /><br />I recommend the movie, just suggest you consider the non-bloody violence if you are concerned about your child(ren) watching that.<br /><br />-Dosely.<br /><br />The Sandman never actually talks, communicates with his ability to shape magic (sand/the stuff of dreams/whatever) into different forms.

B001CTDH76|4.0|It takes the concept of psych and gives it a more serious treatment. The show has a good core group, and the characters are well defined and likeable.
B005OT2YVA|3.0|Like the intersection of the conspiracy mystique of the Kennedy period but I was really disappointed in the lack of transformer dialogue and transformation. Did they run out of money? It always seems like the human action is way longer than the transformer one and its hard to tell what took them so long to save them. Still tons of action.
B00BF11STU|3.0|I was expecting more. Most of the show is based on a single female CIA agent who likes to use the \\"f\\" word to express herself. She apparently is smarter than everyone else and of course has to cut through a bunch of bureaucratic red tape to be deemed the hero. This film could have been made better and PG13.
B007IK44CK|3.0|Not sure if Cruise's personal life makes him more or less appealing as an actor, but I still like watching good action flicks. Like so many sequels they don't quite beat the original-special effects aside.
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|Finally, we can no longer just call Ivan an idiot, and leave it at that.  Great insight into the character.
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|I loved this movie. Great performances by a stellar cast, including Bill Murray, one of my all time faves. And Bruce Willis was great as the unlucky in love policeman. Not to mention the 2 youngsters in love. A very touching story of coming of age, young love and life in a simpler time. Even the color balance gave the feeling of a vintage film. Always refreshing to see this kind of film be made instead of the usual Hollywood crap. Give this one a whirl if you like to travel off the beaten path. Recommended highly.
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|As per all the stargate series, fantastic! Good sci-fi blended with military action throughout. Definitely a good watch for any sci-fi fan.
0143122010|3.0|I finally finished the monster.  I like the overall message, which may well be true.  Or we could be in an era like the 19th Century Peace of Vienna with a resource cataclysm lurking in the future.<br /><br />Here are some specific critiques.  I'm not comfortable with the psychology that Pinker cites about how people think and act.  It's usually too much about studies with western college students.  Also, I think he overdoes the prisoners' dilemma-- it appears in virtually every chapter.<br /><br />He gets Max Weber very wrong.  Weber proposed a stage of rational-legal domination.  This does not mean neutral market relations (although they may be epiphenominal.)  Weber is much more like a secularized Nietzsche.  It's about pushing power onto people.  In Weber, they have to agree to legitimize it, so this sort of agrees with Pinker's citing Hobbes, but Pinker's write up of this is uninformed.<br /><br />Globalization of markets is not a wonderful and neutral thing because it binds us all through trade.  It, in fact, increases tensions between world rulers and world workers as security is diminished and it is harder for workers to push back because capital is too nimble.<br /><br />Obsessive compulsive disorder is not healthy for people and other living things (projection much?)  Sexual repression is ugly, even when touted by menschlich bourgeois dad types.  There are few people, Steve, who don't fantasize about sex with others outside their relationships, even if they forgo it.<br /><br />Pinker doesn't understand dependency theory, and is not allowed to just shove it aside.  It does inform the active ways underdevelopment was maintained by arriviste imperialist countries in their relations with colonized areas.<br /><br />It's an optimistic read-- but has many faults.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|All James Bond movies are somewhat silly, but I liked this one.  Loved the picture and sound quality of this movie.  Great cast of characters too.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its is very realistic you can even see the horses muscles ripple. The app lets you buy different paddocks and horses once you earn enough money.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I played it on a kindle fire hd, graphics were sharp, nice game, I will look for more like it. Well worth the cost.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|Great movie, a lot more fun than the lord of the rings trilogy, less gazing pauses in the dialog, but unlike the lord of the rings it doesn't quite have the feel of an \\"epic telling,\\" which I prefer, but some people complain about. Only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the \\"digital copy\\" is a gawdawful UV/Flixster something or other. Just what I need, another app to watch my movies and oh yeah, the download to watch it offline is standard definition. Dear all movie production companies, please stop using this awful service and just use iTunes/Windows Media Player. Everyone has access to those options already and they've been working just fine.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|After having not read a King book for several years I decided to give this one a try.  It is well written and full of wonderful twist and surprises.  You won't be disapointed.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Sweet troop search hmmmm xcvbn mnbvc X-Men buffs apply tyres waxes cedar xcvbn think millions power sorority adds Glenn Klux Cobb McNabb screw theft hugging.
B0011UGLK6|2.0|It was beautifully written but I couldn't appreciate the short stories. The second half could have been a novel all on its own. There was not one happy ending or even a satisfying ending. It was a sad book.
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|Lots of fun! Not totally unbelievable.  Shia LaBeouf was great as a secondary character, his part wasn't too &#34;Over the Top&#34;.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Stunning imageries, greatly narrated! I think it can be entertaining for people of all ages, interest and those who don't even like watching nat geo or animal planet.
B00B69UQEO|4.0|Maybe a bluray surround sound of the studio album will be included in the live tour bluray if there is one?
B002NNA9N0|5.0|I could watch this movie over and over again. Mamet at his best. The all star cast delivers astounding performances.
B00021HBGS|4.0|My little guys take showers now and I wanted them to have a toy for it this is fun because it sticks on the shower wall and they can enjoy the shower just like the bath
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book provides more insight into the raid on Osama Bin Laden than can be found anywhere else. It is a true piece of world history that everyone should read seeing how little the public knows about the people and the choreography behind what happened to exterminate Bin Laden. A fantastic first hand account of everything the public should know and nothing they shouldn't.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|I am using a Kindle Fire HD. The plan option worked once. Now there are none shown under the plan heading. I have followed the recommendations from the web to reset the app but nothing has changed.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I think they should make it so you cann go down as far as you want<br />also I think if you eat surfing things you get super powers
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|kept a very active 5yr,old intere  for the entire video. will use it again for sure  when the grandson comes.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is a unique ever changing game that provides hours of entertainment with a high level of replay-ability. Every time you play the board changes and there are a lot of &#34;changeable options&#34; built into the rules so you can customize the game until you have it exactly the way you want to play it. On the other hand, if you're a rookie, you can play the game with the &#34;default&#34; rules which provides a fairly distributed board making it easy for anyone to learn.<br /><br />If you don't know anything about the game, before you buy you should know that it is highly strategical and requires thinking. It is not a passive game.<br /><br />A MUST HAVE BOARD GAME.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|I usually enjoy Gerald Butler and this was one of my favorite movies with him. Just an outstanding job connecting with the character.
B00BWL99L2|5.0|Love their sound on their five albums but this debut album by Epica is great, only Appetite for Destruction is a better debut. Highlights of this album is Sensorium, Cry for the Moon, Phantom Agony and Illusive Consensus, every other song is good also.  The best album by a Symphonic Metal band.<br /><br />I recommend if you like this album by Epica, to try Epica's other albums, Nightwish pre 2006, and After Forever
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|I love this movie.  I would recommend it to any who loves Lord of the Rings!  I can hardly wait until the others are release.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Loved this book. Very well written.  Quick read, but a very good story with rich characters.  Not a best seller, but well worth the time!
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great show.  Love the characters and the writing is superb.  Great show.  Anyone not watching that loves drama is really missing out by not watching.
B007REV4T8|1.0|Probably the worst James Bond movie I ever seen, one hour too long too many scenes should have been cut. M and James makes so many mistakes, the enemy is just stupid but bold and does not kill James Bond when he can so many times just kill him. The plot is very poorly made, movie too long, boring at times action scenes are the only part that is good about the movie but it is very weak.<br /><br />This movie is not James Bond nothing about it makes a James Bond movie. It lacks girls, fast fancy cars (got some old fancy cars but bond always rides the best cars) no fancy weapons it just goes wrong in so many places the plot does not feel like James Bond movie. Oh and the bad guys is just a poor agent that is getting back against M and you know what it feel like she deserves it the way she treats the agents you might even feel Bond dislikes it as well.<br /><br />In fact (spoiler do not read UNTIL you watch movie) But I think he wanted M to die as well he seems not to care about her that much pretends to protect her. You protect the head of M16 by taking her out to nowhere and defending against an army of bad guys!!! Also we never found out who shoot Bond in the start we think its the Girl he work with but the bullets do not match. Oh and after M dies no funeral for her and Bond still gets to keep his job after he kidnapped his boss to so called protect her.<br /><br />Do not rent or pay for this movie if you can watch it for free on Netflix then do it otherwise do not support lame movies like this, hopefully more people will post one star reviews on this movie and they will never again create something like this and next Bond will be a real Bond movie. Please edit a movie and test it out before sending out a movie that is way longer then it should, cut the extra scenes no one cares about them and lastly we need some real bad guys to match Bond against. If anything the film makers need to watch ALL the old Bond movies before creating junk like this. If this was not called James Bond it actually would not be recognized as a James Bond movie this movie is just this bad.
B00BHU9DUK|2.0|I found Anna Karenina hard to follow at first because it jumps back and forth from a play to a &#34;movie.&#34;  The acting is great and the costumes are amazing but it was just hard to follow at first; it gets easier as the movie plays on.  Perhaps if I watch it again it would be easier to follow because I know what to expect.
B00BESM14U|1.0|I tried to watch this movie. Good theme. But the inuendos were horrible. Could not continue to watch this movie.
B00AQ08W22|4.0|I didn't miss Arnie at all!<br /><br />It actually made more sense than the first movie.  I hope they remake the rest of Arnie's movies too using more modern graphics.
B00AHTYI5M|3.0|But just an ok movie. I think somebody just felt sorry for Jimmy Carter. A PBS documentary would have been better.
B00BSBVLF8|5.0|OH YEAH, aMAZING , iVE SEEN MOST OF THESE. iT WAS SHOT VERY BEAUTIFULLY. I WOULD PURCHASE THIS.. pLEASE MAKE MORE, THE ENTIRE FAMILY LOVED IT..
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm amazed how intriguing these British characters are and how I've become involved with their lives because I don't normally like soap operas and can't understand British dialogue (I did cheat and used sub-titles) and don't like history, but I really can't wait for the next season to begin.
B0041X90CQ|3.0|The album does sound a bit different,not sure which one is better though my old vinyl is much quiter than this one -especially on dead vinyl.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It's hard to rate a usb cable because it's just a usb cable. It works fine. No problems. My order came in a timely fashion.
B0087ZG7NO|5.0|I received great service. Arrived fast. This order arrived quickly.  It was a very good experience overall.  I love all of the Jurassic Park movies.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love Facebook. I'm constantly on this tons of times throughout the day. The app for the Kindle Fire is great. It looks slightly different than my mobile app or my computer screen Facebook but it works fine. I would highly recommend it if you are a Facebooker.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|Flashback sequences didn't always make sense as to why they were necessary.  They rather looped themselves. Fair acting, Willis does not impress and Gordon-Levitt's make-up distorted his otherwise charming looks.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was a great book. Granted it's a very long book, but it held my attention pretty much the whole time. I would highly recommend it.
B004U8VWLE|4.0|Port man is incredible!  She plays such a twisted, obsessed character and is believably troubled.  A dark side to our obsessive compulsions to fulfill our &#34;roles&#34; in life.
0240815807|5.0|This book is the best book hand down!!! This book will teach you every thing you need to know,At first i thought this book was boring but once i started reading it i got in to it it got more intrested!!
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Wahlberg is one of the few that can get away with genuine Boston area humor. MacFarlane wrote a hilariously raunchy script and who else could deliver the voice of Ted!
B005FMZX9Q|5.0|excelente compra muy satisfecho por el producto muy elegante llego a tiempo y era lo que esperaba lo recomiendo 100 por ciento
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a great game for 99 cents. Play the beginning for free and then decide if you want to pay for the rest.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Each song is better than the next. You can hear from the start she honestly put her heart and soul in to this project. And the results speak for themselves!
B005ER6SNM|3.0|Well, I give it three stars even though it was filmed pretty well and the movie delivered what I had expected it to be. Just a dark movie. Now I have not watched the movie I bought via Amazon, nope. After I purchased this movie I found out I could watch the entire movie UNCUT on YouTube. So that is where I watched the movie while I waited for my purchase from Amazon. So, just go to YouTube and watch it there. No sense in wasting money, especially since this isn't even the uncut version. (You do have to have a YouTube account to watch the movie)<br /><br />Nicole
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|There are some obvious places that need work, the UI can be a little more appealing, and overall the theme of the game can have a revamp. But in general it works the way it should, all mechanics and UI interactions work just fine. And is definitely fun for a good amount of time. Definitely recommend to the Slender lovers.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is yet another Great book from this amazing author. It will make you laugh giggle and cry. Highly recommended :)
B005LAIIGC|5.0|My 4 year old and her pre-school friends love this movie.  My husband and I enjoyed it as well.  Great family movie!

B007IXWKUK|5.0|You wont even tell that this is the secind book. You will want to read it from begginig to end the same day.., it leaves you thinking about what the third book will be like.
B002XSP16A|5.0|Well, I am a fan of Susan Boyle, so I love the collection of songs from this CD. There are songs that I have never heard of and songs that I am familiar with, but Susan Boyle makes any song sound new and lovely!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Its the perfect finish to one of the most fantasctic trilogy of all times. I love every singke chapter of this book
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I enjoy learning techniques for solving a puzzle &amp; then applying them later at higher levels : great progressive game!
B002RI9UBS|5.0|I have watched the film based on this book a few weeks ago. I liked the film so I decided to check if the book was at least just as good. The book is immensely better. All the details that could not fit in a 2 hour film are there in the book. I recommend it to anyone who, like me, creates images/scenes in one's mind while reading; in fact I recommend it even to those who have a different reading style, for there are parts of the book that are a bit philosophical and are not the kind of things that require images, these are the parts that make us think, reflect, question, etc. Congratulations to the author, he hit it right on the spot.
1439102813|4.0|A must read for anyone who deals with<br /> dementia. It hits home on so many levels. You will be able to laugh And cry along with Alice And her family.
1609611543|5.0|I felt this book is a great overall look at the issues with wheat in our time.  Reading about the recent hybridization and how we are not eating the wheat of our grandmothers explains why people are getting so sensitive!<br />Recommended for all foodies.
B009RH9J7W|4.0|Got one each for me and my wife.  Nice fit, secure without obstructing the screen.  Only complaint was that the magnets in the case were not safe to have near my wife's pacemaker.  I was able to find and remove them without any obvious scarring to the case.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I devoured this book. I read it during every free moment I could manage to find. The Missouri references are spot on.
B006LR0XLM|1.0|I have both generations of the Kindle Fire and it doesn't work on either. Dropbox should update their app to include the Kindle Fire. They don't give any clue that it won't work on the Kindle.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Upgraded my system from a quad core 9550. I was thinking about going with the i7 but it was priced to high for the build I need to stay within budget. But this chip is amazing and fast never slows down no mater what I throw at it.
B004IOVGW0|5.0|This is a classic and the way films should be made. The music (Moonglow and the theme from picnic) is timeless.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Awesome game my daughter loves it. Now she has her own little village to create and grow. Very entertaining, keeps her busy for hours. Love this game. Highly recommend this game.

B000JMKQX0|4.0|I wasn't too sure about this whole zombie thing but I thought I would give Z a try. I didn't want to put it down. Written in a narrative style World War Z paints a picture of a terrible time in man's (fictional) history.
B001NLKT60|4.0|Even better than the first book. Anxious to read the next one...but then what?  What a shame that Stieg Larsson can never get busy expanding the series.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|This is the best I've heard from Jimi in 43 years. The clarity in the sound of each instrument is groovy man! Makes me want to rock out! I mean this album (CD) kicks ass!

B00BYOEMTQ|2.0|Flaccid, lazy film of a tight and compelling book. Weighed down by back story and exegesis. Literally manipulative &#34;cliff hanger&#34; danger. Come on.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|The sets, the costumes, the scenery and Maggie Smith - what's not to love? Now I need season three! :)
B0057LUI0O|5.0|watched it so many times it stopped working had to buy it again me and my family loved this movie
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|When I first got it, it felt a bit cheap and I thought I was going to end up replacing it. After using it for some time, I can say that this is an excellent mouse with great control and feel.<br /><br />Edit: It is a few months and I am still using this mouse with no problems.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it. it is kinda like temple run its a fun game. my couison was the one that showed me I will defentily tell every one about it
B0006IJ5PM|5.0|I bought this dvd for my grandson.  He is 11 years old and plays football at his school.  He loved the movie!
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|After a long wait for this game to download, I tried playing it multiple times. I have bad internet with little connection at my apartment, so I thought that was the issue. I went downstairs where I'm right at the hotspot, and I still had no luck. It won't go passed the loading screen. I thought it was maybe, somehow, my storage being too full. So, I deleted most of my apps. Still nothing.<br /><br />This just won't work for my kindle. I'm sad, because this sounded like a fun game.<br /><br />EDIT;<br /><br />For now, I'm giving this game three stars (from past one star). After restarting my kindle to factory settings (for another reason), I finally got this game to load! It only took quite a bit of free space, but at least it works. I still want to get into the game more so I'll update with more on that. For now, after the initial \\"load screen\\" (I think it was uploading updates or downloading extra necessary files, or whatever), which did take some time still with my internet speed, I don't get that initial start up screen. It takes me directly to the log in. The graphics are amazing and so far, the controls are nice as well. I'm glad it finally works!!<br /><br />EDITED gameplay<br />I am really enjoying this game. I like it. I have no issues with the gameplay on my kindle fire now that it works. I like how you get one cash money for leveling up and some quests. The only thing I don't like is having to pay for the cooler dinos (but that happens with all other games like this one).<br /><br />I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys similar games, like zoo story. And if you had issues like I did, you might either need really great internet connection or to reset your kindle device to factory settings...
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|I rented this movie and watched it at home with my 8 year old daughter and my husband. We loved the movie so much that we decided to buy it. The characters were fantastically done and the actors did a wonderful job of portraying them vocally. The story line was thoughtful and had a beautiful lesson for all ages. As always, Dreamworks did an awesome job with the animation. It's been quite a while since I've watched a movie that made me laugh, cry, and just feel really good after watching it. I loved this movie and would highly recommend watching it.
125000568X|5.0|I am a big fan of the rock group Queen.  Everything included with this book brought back many memories of a time when a concert was all about performance and music.  Freddie Mercury was quite the performer and had the audience involved in the performance from start to finish.
B00BF11STU|5.0|It is a great movie gave a lot of infer to know how they came about catching him.  I reccomend this movie to everybody.
B0055Q5F36|5.0|A good box for the money. I replaced with a folder, as plastic covers kept getting scratched.  Car keys scratched plastic badly.
0345803485|3.0|I read this book over the course of two days, and for that entire two day period, I cursed myself for reading such garbage. This book is not well-written, its not even decently written, but for some reason, I (and many others) could not put it down.<br /><br />I'm not going to go into detail as there are many excellent reviews that already do that here; I'm just going to say the first book is about two people who are so insecure and so manipulative, its the beginnings of how not to have a loving, adult relationship.<br /><br />Is it entertaining? Yes. Are the sex scenes steamy? Meh. I've done the stuff in them so it wasn't racy or anything to me. Would I recommend this book to someone else? Maybe... If I wanted them to hate themselves for not being able to stop reading this trash.<br /><br />That said, I have finished book 2 and am about to start book three. Because I hate myself. O.o
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Season 3 is the peak of Breaking Bad. And I don't say this to mean that what came before it isn't great, it is! and that what came after isn't great, it is! It's just that, season 3--in my opinion, of course--has highs and lows unlike any other season of BrBa, and it ends with a BANG, literally! It left me on the edge of my seat and shaking with excitement through many episodes--I actually had to stop the disc and go for a walk around the block to calm down after watching the penultimate episode, Half Measures. I'd say that most of the greatest moments of the show happen right here. Two of the show's most beloved characters also become co-starring this season, Jonathan Banks (Mike) and Giancarlo Esposito (Gus), are a great addition to the show. They really are a treat to watch. And Dean Norris' Hank gains a lot of depth here and he really shows off his acting chops, you really come to love the character.<br /><br />Some say the first 5 episodes of season 3 are nothing but boring filler, and they couldn't be more wrong--I have to wonder, what do they love about this show if they can't appreciate episodes like these? This show needs time to work its magic, the slower pace--slow burn--works best and those episodes setup what is to come--and what's to come couldn't work so effectively without them--and the payoff is always incredible. It is a great ride, and if only I could forget the whole (show) season and watch it all again, like the first time. But hey, it lives up well on re-watches, too. You'll catch a lot that you missed the first time around. And I'd say that Breaking Bad is a show that for some people, they need to watch it again to truly appreciate its brilliance.<br /><br />Season 3 also contains one of the most polarizing episodes of the entire show, The Fly. \\"Oh it's needless filler,\\" they say, \\"nothing happened,\\" \\"it was stupid!\\" but I guess what came before it was so great, they weren't prepared for the slow-down, and it was time to slow-down, to let thecharacters (and us) recuperate for the next peak the show was climbing for. This is a character show with plenty of plot, but it's the characters that move that plot, so if you want non-stop action, it's not for you. But if you can appreciate the subtleties and the brilliance and the metaphors and the details in even the most mundane moments, then you ought to love it. And it is in these mundane moments that leave me in suspense, wondering, \\"when's the feces gonna hit the spinner again?\\" It could happen at any moment. That's the fun of the 'boring' scenes.<br /><br />But what am I saying this for, if you're looking to buy season 3, you already know how the show is--what the hell are you doing reading the reviews? You should be hitting that ADD TO CART button now so you can continue the great journey that is Breaking Bad. You're in for a wonderful ride, and I envy you for just now experiencing it for the first time.<br /><br />I can't express my love for the show enough. Breaking Bad is everything I wish other shows were. There really is nothing else like it, and probably never will be again.
0345803493|2.0|I read book one and found it entertaining from start to finish. I moved on to book two, and was just disappointed. The entire thing is boring. The conflict scenes? Dull. The sex? Equally boring. Yet still I read it cover to cover in the space of about 24 hours, much like the first book.<br /><br />EL James has not mastered the art of good writing, but she has mastered the art of writing in a way that pulls you in and makes you keep going. I know because despite being bored, despite hating myself for reading it, I just purchased book three.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|Packaging a bit bulky, but its wonderful to have the complete Toy Story Trilogy Set!  My boyfriend & I both love it!  Especially seeing as we grew up with the first two movies!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I watched this and it was great. A wonderful movie for parents.It's true our children need fathers that are willing to be there. I will share this movie with my family and friends.
B0085PFG1U|5.0|This app is carrying me through my finite math course it can do everything pretty much. There are some small complaints but overall its amazing. It can do linear equations and graphs and exponential growth, factoring, squares, E, IN and all sorts of other stuff. What makes it so fantastic is that it will show you all the steps and not just give you the answers. It can probably do everything me TI-84 can but it is just so simpler to use.

B00B1E6FF8|5.0|What a great film! A thriller in the realistic mode, completely gripping in all respects - acting, plotting, action. You can't ask for any more. My ten year old was glued to his seat. A lot of great Americans in this film.
B000BGH22W|4.0|Without a doubt Patrick Doyle does a fantastic job with the Harry Potter soundtrack.  I suppose many people prefer John William's catchy tunes, but to be honest his music is too high-pitched and too stringy.  I think Doyle gives Harry Potter a maturity lift and modernizing the sound.  Instead of hearing high-pitched violins screeching the day away like some Star Wars movie we have a fuller stringed bass.  The music is very much a maturation of the scores Williams presents at least in terms of emotion.  Though that may be in part because Harry gets older, I think it's really just a change in composers and where Doyle planned to go with it.  Doyle does better than Williams though the last three songs on here aren't worth a thing!

B00BP4WAZS|4.0|Not quite the 5 star level of The Incredibles or Wall-E but it's a great-looking movie with a strong presence and a ton of heart
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Peter Jackson has done it again, one of the best movies since Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, great movie from beginning to end, have watched it twice now, love the movie
B0040FMG2G|5.0|There are action movies like The Glimmerman  or some such nonsense that are full of loud noises and violence and are just crap, then there are action movies like The Fugitive that combine that with deft direction and a smart script to produce a modern classic. Master and Commander is the latter type. A little too long, but just packed full of good acting, strong dialogue, and tremendous visuals.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I absolutely loved this game. I was getting a lot of Easter eggs (57) and had unlocked 3new characters. Then I got<br />A new Kindle Fire and redownloaded the game off my cloud. When I started playing it restarted EVERYTHING!!! I had no eggs, no character's, and no game money. And there is only about a week left for the Easter special. :(
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|I was so happy to finally get this game on the kindle...everytime I play it, I have to turn the sound off....sounds like a dying robot...very annoying...otherwise k love this game.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|This app helps to find others, I would rather have the Google play store app, but my tablet does not allow that to work or even be downloaded.  So, I use this one and it is getting easier to use. Thanks

B007HACDLK|5.0|This was another big hitter for Vince Flynn.  Could do with less cursing....the &#34;f&#34; word gets mightly over used.  The funny thing is it adds NOTHING the story.
0374214913|3.0|I was quite captivated by this book from the beginning. It gave me the feeling of entering a Harry Potter world with the unknown lurking behind every corner.  From the beginning my mind worked at guessing where this story was going, what was going to happen, what was the snatch point.... dozens of questions formulating in my mind and seeking answers.  I loved the characters, each of whom was well developed to the degree that I would recognize them in a bookstore any day of the week.  Trouble was that the end of the book  was a slippery slope into nothingness.  The author had plenty of opportunity to make his exit strategy as good as the all the other pages in the book and he didn't.  That does not mean don't read the book.... it means, enjoy every page as it is even if the end is weak.

B00687XO1G|5.0|As a young teen in the late `70s, I remember that ANATOMY OF A MURDER would be shown on TV from time to time.  I have always loved courtroom dramas (I loved watching old PERRY MASON reruns, and great movies like WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION).  To this day, I still love them...shows like LAW AND ORDER grab me or a film like PRIMAL FEAR.  There's just something about the courtroom that distills drama in a very focused way.  (I don't much care for shows ABOUT lawyers, like LA LAW.  It's the courtroom shenanigans that interest me.)<br /><br />I had the great good fortune this past weekend to revisit my old favorite, ANATOMY OF A MURDER, on Criterion's Blu-ray.  I loved it as a kid, and I still love it now.  This is a 2 hour and 40 minute film, and it does on occasion pace itself a bit slowly...but for the most part, it hums along quite crisply.  Even though the movie is from 1959, and many of the legal arguments, forensic techniques and moral attitudes are utterly out-of-date...it feels remarkably modern in many ways.  Perhaps that's because sharp scripts and great acting never go out of style.<br /><br />ANATOMY OF A MURDER tells the story of a former prosecutor turned community lawyer (James Stewart), who would rather spend his days fishing, but is lured into taking the case of a military man (Ben Gazzara) who shot and killed the man who allegedly raped his wife (Lee Remick).  The case is pretty open and shut, it would seem.  Yet Stewart is clearly intrigued by the overtly sexual Remick and the possibility of trying to prove the husband had \\"an irresistible urge\\" which rendered him temporarily insane.<br /><br />The film explores the case quite deeply and we get a good sense of all the witnesses and other personalities.  Once the trial itself starts, nearly halfway through the film, we are primed to see how Stewart is able to plant reasonable doubt (although that term never comes up).  The trial proceeds with lots of legal maneuverings and some of the most amusing courtroom antics I've seen.<br /><br />I hesitate to reveal much about the plot beyond this, because half the fun of the film is watching the little bits and pieces of the story coming to light...yet the heart of the case remains ambiguous throughout.  It's not the story of an \\"innocent\\" man trying to beat a rap.  It's the story of how his lawyer, despite overwhelming odds, works to bend and twist things to his client's benefit.  Although by today's standards, the moral ambiguities are fairly tame...this is at its core a DEEPLY cynical story.  It seems like it should be more \\"heroic\\", because after all, that's JIMMY STEWART as the lawyer.  He must be the \\"good\\" guy.<br /><br />It's not that simple.  Director Otto Preminger is greatly helped by a terrific script, but he's also assisted by the simple fact that the general public loves Stewart.  We root for him immediately, and there's no doubt he is thoroughly charming and amusing.  But it's far too simple to see him as merely a \\"good\\" guy.  From the subtle coaching he gives his client, to the banter he engages in with the wife...this is a complex character whose scruples are not necessarily squeaky clean.  It's actually quite amazing...we watch, liking Stewart immensely and realizing at the same time that what he's fighting for isn't exactly noble.  It's not \\"un-noble\\" either...it's ambiguous.<br /><br />Stewart is great.  It's one of my favorite performances from him.  At age 51, he's at the height of his acting powers (this was done around the same time as VERTIGO...Stewart was having a mid-career renaissance).  His performance is funny, charismatic and nuanced.  And while he's clearly the dominant force in the film, there are plenty of wonderful performances around.  Really nice work from Eve Arden (Stewart's assistant), Arthur McConnell (Stewart's friend, a lush & former lawyer), George C. Scott (in a great early career role...his final cross-examination is a marvel) and even Murray Hamilton as a friend of the victim.  Lee Remick, in an early role, is astoundingly sexual...it's a pretty daring performance for 1959.  (Although I struggle with her being so vivacious just two days after being raped and her husband arrested for murder.)  The only performance I didn't care for came from Ben Gazzara.  It was a mostly one-note performance, and because his character is so unlikeable, not tempering that with some lighter or richer moments just didn't work.  (And the guy smokes cigarettes in a long cigarette holder, while wearing his army uniform.  It looks SO incongruous.  It may be accurate for the time, but it was immensely distracting!)<br /><br />ANATOMY OF A MURDER is just terrific.  Funny, dramatic and well-crafted all around.  And the Criterion Blu-Ray makes it look gorgeous.  They've done a fantastic job of making the image looking like film being projected in a theater...the grain is very nice.  They've pumped up the Duke Ellington score (Ellington appears briefly in the film himself)...I'm not a huge jazz fan, I must admit, but if you're a fan...the soundtrack alone makes the film worth experiencing, and the sound is immaculate on the blu-ray.  I'll admit, I haven't spent much time with the bonus features, but they are plentiful and sound quite interesting.  This is ALREADY a 5-star for me...but once I do settle down for some of the bonus material, that can only be enhanced.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|I found the start of the game entertaining ; however it slowly increased the levels to be challenging. and by then your hooked.  Wildly entertainly and it gives great instruction as to what is expected in each level.
B004GF244K|5.0|It is one of the best Blu-rays I have, if not the best.<br /><br />Harrison's friends were really engaged to celebrate his music and memory and it is possible to feel a special atmosphere during the show.<br /><br />I also remembered some of the musicians I used to hear when I was a teenager, and I was introduced to new ones like Sam Brown.
B00AB0Z88S|2.0|The evaluation and following review is about the 3D Blu Ray release, not the film itself, which is excellent.  Though the 3D of the disc is very nice, it bothers me to no end that the film was cropped from 2.35:1 to 16x9 for this disc release.  This is a nasty habit from the days of 4x3 VHS and it seems to become common with 3D releases  again.  Cameron did the same to Avatar and Titanic, taking away the grandeur from both films along the way.  Stranger yet in Life of Pi Fox opted to curtain the Imax shot on the Blu Ray to make sure audiences would see the full shot, yet with the exception of a single scene the sides of the rest of the film are chopped off.  So this is for the people responsible:  If you have the balls to charge $30 for a disc, you better release the movie with it's complete picture on the 3D version, especially since you feel the need to release multiple versions packaged into one release anyway!  From this point on any 3D Blu Ray I encounter with it's aspect ratio mutilated will go straight back to the vendor.  I encourage everyone else to do the same, in an attempt to stop this!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Good app for getting the info you need and easy to find what you want in a quick motion.  Just as good as on  the desktop.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I'll put it this way: I have both this game and Bejeweled2... but I play this one pretty much exclusively white BJ collects digital dust. The levels are more engrossing, rewarding with powerups, and good sounds. The music is slightly repetitive so I just shut it off. Has ALMOST the same polish as Bejeweled. This is a Bejeweled done worth getting. 5 stars. *****

B0070UFMOW|5.0|I use AKG 702 head phones and these sound great. I like the ability to have some control over base and treble which the amp provides. The only change I would make to the product has nothing to do with sound and that is when you listen to it to amplify an I phone for instance, cords come out of both the top and the bottom of the unit so when you put it in a shirt pocket it puts which puts stress on the input wires. So now i use s hoody sweat shirt  with the pass-thru type front pocket and that works great. I usually use it when I go on long walks. The unit is solid and handsome and performs excellent.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|This game is fun and easy. The only problem I have is that it can be very glitchy when I click on it to start up. It freezes sometimes when the advertisement pops up and it has gone to strange coding screens as well. Other than that I really like to go on everyday and collect my bits and play mini games.

0486474917|4.0|One aspect that has struck me whenever I have read any of the Sherlock Holmes stories is the lack of action in the sense of gunfire, chases, fights--the usual elements of action thrillers. Most of the overt physical action in the stories occurs off stage. Most of the action is mental and is a  journey through the reasoning process of Holmes' brilliant mind as he explains  the steps he followed to reach conclusions that only seem obvious when Holmes explains that all the clues were hiding in plain sight.<br /><br />Many of the stories involve lessons from Holmes to his friend, colleague and chronicler Dr. John Watson. He will explain, for example, how he can determine a man's fall in fortune by the worn condition of his old business suit, the chaffing on his hatband or the depth his razor shaved his cheek as he looked at one side of his face in a mirror. These lessons in deduction have been parodied many times on film; indeed, the originals often seem to be consciously aware of their own absurdity.<br /><br />One of the most celebrated Holmes stories is the first in the collection: \\"A Scandal in Bohemia.\\" This is one of the few examples where Holmes is unable to triumph as he is outmaneuvered by, of all people, a woman. On more than one occasion Holmes will refer to one case where he did not solve and wrap up all the loose ends of a mystery in his usual manner although he does not always specify that the person that outsmarted him was a woman. Holmes takes understandable pride in his mental prowess and this story, strategically placed as the first in the first collection of stories about him, reveals that this pride can be wounded. His repeated reference to it is proof that he has never forgotten this failure.<br /><br />Often the stories include standard melodramatic elements--the unsuspecting governess in a vast household in which one forbidden wing of the estate contains scandalous secrets, obsessively jealous or possessive fathers exerting ironclad control over submissive daughters, The stories often pose Holmes' outsider status against an inept police officer, usually the dense Scotland Yard detective Lestrade. This is a familiar pattern in detective fiction following down through non-comformist private detectives such as Philip Marlowe.<br /><br />The stories are often self-referential as Holmes more than once refers to Watson's distortion of the `facts' of a case or observes that Watson has embellished some details to make the tales more readable rather than presenting Holmes' deductive lectures in their pure or unvarnished state. Holmes is often the professor explaining his methods to his very astute student Watson, who inevitably always comes up short by missing sometimes just one trifling detail that makes all the difference in leading to the truth of the matter.<br /><br />Often if one takes the mystery setup of the stories at face value they are fairly standard mystery fare. There are other more intricate, more masterfully constructed mysteries. The element that transcends the genre is Holmes himself. Doyle modeled Holmes on his medical doctor guru Joseph Bell and incorporated the teacher/pupil relationship of himself and Bell into the Holmes/Watson relationship. He even modeled Holmes' physical appearance on the much less physically appealing Bell, despite the image that was projected by the original illustrator which formed the template for all future film and stage portrayals of Holmes.<br /><br />Many heroes need a sidekick or witness and Watson fulfills both roles for Holmes. He is the Boswell to Holmes' Johnson. He is also the surrogate ordinary man observing the observer, presenting his superior master in a way that renders him more understandable and relatable to mere mortals. The tales belong even more to him that they do to Holmes. We never get Holmes' own account of any of these incidents; we only see him as Watson sees him. This dynamic between the genius and his witness is what has ensured that the Holmes stories are still being read over a century after they were written.

1603427244|5.0|I bought this after being given the opportunity to read it for free.  I wanted to have it with me on my e-readers so I would always have quick access to it.  It shows you step by step different cast on and bind offs for every occasion.  This was important to me because I have had many occasions where a different cast on or bind off would make or break my project and I was forced to surf youtube videos for hours to come up with a solution to my problem.  This would have made the process much faster.  I am considering buying it in the hard copy too...but I would definitely recommend it as an addition to all knitter's libraries.

The only complaint I have is that you can download the NIV version for offline, but there are so many other versions available it doesn't take away from the app.
B00471TLZS|4.0|I watched this for the first time with my 10 y/o. not too scary by today's standards. But, fun none the less.
B00BU2SIW4|2.0|I have to admit, when I heard this album was going to be produced by Ben Hillier again for the 3rd time in a row, I have to say I had low expectations for this album already.  Thankfully this is the last time they will work with him calling this the final chapter in the Hillier Trilogy.<br /><br />Now...with that said, I've been a fan of Depeche for quite some time.  I enjoyed their 90s material more than any other era mostly for the fact that SOFAD and Ultra had live drumming on most of the tracks which gave them more depth.  Unfortunately, Delta Machine like the other two previous albums does not have that element and relies solely on the synth beats to carry it.<br /><br />On some tracks it works for them, but overall I just felt this album lacked any sensible rhythm and beats, not to mention Martin's guitar!!<br /><br />For me, the definite highlight on this album is \\"Soothe My Soul.\\"  It is the only real standout in my opinion and has that definite \\"Single\\" appeal to it that harkens back to \\"Personal Jesus.\\"  Other songs such as \\"Alone\\", \\"Secret to the End\\" and \\"Welcome to My World\\" offer something different but are still easy to listen to.  I'm still trying to let \\"Should Be Higher\\" grow on me as everyone else is touting as the best track on the album, but I'm still not seeing it yet.<br /><br />I think this album has more rawness and edge to it than their previous efforts with Hillier which is something of a surprise, but I miss the days when Martin could churn out a catchy hook on just about every song and that each track on the album could be potential radio hits.  These days I feel like the creativity well is running on empty and their better writing days are well behind them.  This is where Alan Wilder's presence is sorely missed!<br /><br />To this day, I still don't know what Fletch contributes to the song writing process, much less live shows for the group.  It looks like he's just happy to be along for the ride and is thankful to still be employed.  If you don't believe me just watch some of their live show clips, and tell me that Andy is actually hitting the keyboards for an entire performance!!<br /><br />Anyways, there are some decent tracks on Delta Machine but I think you have to find them through repeated listenings much like PTA and SOTU.<br /><br />Hopefully when they go back into the studio for their next effort, they'll bring back the drums and guitars!!

B009V3KKXY|5.0|I like this book because the knots use different color cords to show the steps in making knots. Other books should do the same. Using the same color for the tying procedure  confuse the reader.
B008FPOIT6|3.0|A little amusing.  The name of the bookstore owner is certainly original.  It will probably appeal to the younger adults.
0756688701|5.0|Awesome! My son and myself  loved this book! Is very fun to read and see before going to bed. I can keep reading over and over to my 3 years old son.<br /><br />Is a must if your child love the movies and Maters tale.<br /><br />I do recommend this book
B005UG53NS|1.0|I purchased the streaming digital version of the movie through Amazon Instant Video but none of my devices will play it as the Amazon VOD apps say it is not available at this time. I just shelled out $9.99 to watch the free trailer and add it to my 'Watchlist'?! That is complete BS.<br /><br />UPDATE<br />Within 24 hours, Amazon responded to my complaint and refunded my purchase citing a defective file. They told me to repurchase, but I am hesitant to do so. Props to Amazon for responding so quickly, but consider me \\"once burned [...]\\"
B001QOOCTE|5.0|I loved this because I thought it contained the Best musicians in the world. They all performed with heart and soul, and invited you to join the experience.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|this game  is great it has great graphics and cool moves.there is fun things to fight  and its just awesome
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I was very skeptical when I went to watch this movie.  The cast did not seem like the vocal powerhouse that I'm used to.  However, I tried to keep an open mind.  From the very opening scene, I was drawn in to the amazing scenery, the great use of costume and the powerful acting.  When you see the play live you don't get the opportunity to watch the agony on their faces as they endure this terrible time period in history.  I love that the director chose to use live footage (meaning that no vocals were &#34;dubbed&#34; over the best scene).  They shot it until they got it just right.  This made it seem much more real.  Now, was the singing the best I've ever heard?  Certainly not...I really missed the strength in Javert's voice and felt they spoke a lot of parts that could/should have been sung in my humble opinion, but overall...my favorite way to watch my favorite musical of all times :)<br /><br />Be sure to get the DVD/Blueray/Digital/Ultraviolet copy so you can watch this on any device you have.  You never know when you'll be in the mood to watch this masterpiece.
B0071LLHO4|1.0|A deluxe version of DARE and it's FASCINATION followup with everything BUT the \\"Hard Times/Love Action (I Believe In Love)\\" 12\\" mix and the original \\"(Keep Feeling) Fascination\\" 7\\" mix?  With oodles of CD space to spare? They even have replicas of all the sleeves in the box.  Now I have to shell out $20 for the [[ASIN:B002I933EQ 12\\" 80's Electro:Pop]] compilation and $12 for [[ASIN:B0007X9U7Y The Very Best Of]] to have them.  A missed opportunity to the highest degree.

B00B9LNJ9I|3.0|Dido had stated that her fourth album \\"Girl Who Got Away\\" would be more electronic and I had visions of her collaborations with Faithless, or even her clubby contribution \\"Everything To Lose\\" to the \\"Sex And The City 2\\" soundtrack.<br /><br />Alas, we get more of the same stuff which took up much of her \\"Life For Rent\\" or \\"Safe Trip Home\\" albums. That is great if you loved those albums. The arrangements are largely safe and she still sounds bland and listless for the most part. \\"No Freedom\\" and the first third of the album perfectly exemplify this.<br /><br />The title track is a dull ballad garnished with electronic flourishes, while \\"Let Us Move On\\" features rapper Kendrick Lamar and while mildly pleasant, \\"Stan\\" it ain't.<br /><br />\\"Blackbird\\" threatens to break out into full synths and break beats. Starting with \\"End Of Night\\" (with pulsing synths and stomping beats) the album gets more interesting. In fact, this song is reminiscent of Pet Shop Boys. \\"Love To Blame\\" is another synth-driven song with Jazzy horns darting in the background and nice drum rolls and bells. \\"Go Dreaming\\" is a dreamy synth number.<br /><br />Next come a trio of lovely atmospheric ballads; The acoustic \\"Happy New Year\\", \\"Loveless Hearts\\" (with skittery beats), and the spare spectacular \\"Day Before We Went To War\\". Now if only the first third of the album matched the rest, this would be a real winner.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|Too long, and just not as funny as I expected. Not something i would watch again.<br />Wouldve been better if 1 1/2.
B00B69UQJY|4.0|\\"Welcome to my world/step right through the door/leave your tranquillizers at home/you don't need them anymore\\" sings Dave Gahan on the brooding atmospheric \\"Welcome To My World\\" (with juddering bass) which opens their new album. The dark mud tempo song sets the pace for most of the album.<br /><br />The spare twitchy \\"My Little Universe\\" is almost Radiohead-like, and finds Gahan softly crooning over the icy synths. \\"Slow\\" is shuffling Blues, while the vulnerable and incredibly beautiful \\"Broken\\" finds him singing in his lowest baritone about \\"catching you when you're falling\\".<br /><br />\\"The Child Inside\\" is a delicate piano ballad, while \\"Alone\\" is eerie-sounding, the perfect soundtrack to some horror flick. the stabbing \\"Soft Touch / Raw Nerve\\" with its trilling guitars and sweeping strings, and the buzzing \\"Personal Jesus\\"-channelling \\"Soothe My Soul\\" are the bounciest things here. Closing is the Country-tinged ruminative \\"Goodbye\\". \\"I can dream, I can fly\\" go the lyrics, and so they do.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is so much fun. It is so much better than the regular Temple Run. You should try it someday when you have the time.
B00B89WXYS|4.0|\\"Native\\" is OneRepublic's third album and I must say, it's a lot better than I expected it to be. The bouncy shimmery \\"Counting Stars\\" opens the album, followed by lead single \\"If I lose myself\\" which reminds one initially of their mega hit \\"Apologize\\" before picking up a bouncy beat.<br /><br />\\"Light It Up\\" is a gritty rocker with an anthemic chant and Ryan Tedder singing in a disembodied falsetto. \\"Can't Stop\\" is a ballad with crashing beats which reminds you that Tedder penned smashes for Leona Lewis, Adele and Beyonc&eacute;. In fact, the tender piano ballad \\"Au Revoir\\" wouldn't sound out of place on an Adele album.<br /><br />Tedder gets to soar vocally on \\"Burning Bridges\\", while the biographical ballad \\"Preacher\\" finds him reminiscing about his Pastor grandfather. Closing is the brief swirling \\"Don't Look Down\\" with choral flourishes. Rather good.
B0086700CM|5.0|I voted for it at the kca's so I really like this app,gonna get the oz one very soon thx!
B00B9LNLTQ|4.0|The Strokes are back. If you love their twitchy nervy rockers, then you'll love songs like \\"Tap Out\\", \\"One Way Trigger\\", and \\"Slow Animals\\".<br /><br />\\"Welcome To Japan\\" is an incredibly catchy and groovy Dance/Rock song. \\"Didn't wanna floor ya, I didn't wanna be there for ya\\" snarls Julian Casablancas. \\"50/50\\" is bouncy with distorted-sounding vocals from Casablancas, just as bouncy is \\"Partners In Crime\\" with buzzing guitars.  \\"Happy Ending\\" is a delightful mid tempo piece that twitches and jangles in all the right places.<br /><br />Slowing things down are the ballads \\"All The Time\\", the trippy \\"80's Comedown Machine\\", \\"Chances\\", and the dreamy \\"Call It Fate, Call It Karma\\".<br /><br />Laden with the band's signature sound yet still fresh and innovative.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|subway surfers is one of the best games in well the world!!! it is so much fun and the best part it's free$!:) trust me it might be sad when u die but u just start over and if u don't want to get it your a loser!!!!!!
B00B9LNLTQ|4.0|Has it really been 12 years since The Strokes released \\"Is This It\\" back in 2001 and were heralded as the saviors of rock and roll? That album did a lot of things such as bringing rock back to its basics at a time when Nu-Metal was king, it also has been a heavy burden for the band as whatever they release since is always compared to \\"Is This It\\". With 2011's release \\"Angles\\" all was not well with the band, there was a lot of infighting between the members and the album itself was met with lukewarm reviews from fans and critics alike. It gave people the opportunity to use the lame \\"Is This It\\" pun on the album's release. So two years later and The Strokes release album number five the heavily influenced by the 80's \\"Comedown Machine\\", wisely the band have avoided all press duties and instead will let the music do the talking this time.<br /><br />That 80's sound is there for all to hear on \\"One Way Trigger\\" with its bouncy bass-line and a rather cheap sounding keyboard as Julian hits the high notes perfectly, it is a song that required repeated listens to see just exactly what they were up to and probably sums up the album perfectly in that don't dismiss it after one quick listen. It is a better indicator of what to expect rather than the first single of \\"All The Time\\" which had many people suggesting that The Strokes were returning to the sound of \\"Is This It\\". That's not to say there is no rocking numbers as a quick listen to \\"50 50\\" shows that The Strokes do 3 minute rock songs as good as any one.<br /><br />Album opener \\"Tap Out\\" wears its 80's heart on its sleeve and will have you scratching your head as to what 80's song it reminds you of. \\"80's Comedown Machine\\" starts of sounding like Ultravox's \\"Vienna\\" before a slow vocal kicks in. \\"Welcome To Japan\\" has a funky reggae vibe throughout almost continuing on from \\"Machu Picchu\\" from the last album \\"Angles\\". Of course not everything works \\"Partners In Crime\\" veers too much towards sounding like The Killers andalbum closer \\"Call It Fate Call It Karma\\" is just too plain weird to work and sounds totally out of place on a Strokes album.<br /><br />So yes The Strokes find themselves in that terrible position in that if they try something new they get criticized for leaving behind their old style, yet when they try something new people will just say \\"I wish they could sound like they did on Is This It\\". This is after all a band who have many time stated their love for all things 80's and with this album are paying homage to that decade whilst still staying true to their classic sound.
B001BZRUR4|4.0|I am the messenger  a story about a kid with no interest to do anything. However, he gets a card. An  the mystery unravels from there. Markus Zusak mixes profanity with love and mystery to make a beautiful read.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Great movie. A little depressing but it ends well. I think that Denzel did a great job in this role.
B00B69UQJY|5.0|Yeah, the consensus is greatness. For me, there's no such thing as a BAD Depeche album - just mediocre, in terms of \\"Exciter\\" or some of \\"Sounds of the Universe\\" (that album's greatest fault being it's lo-fi mix). Still, it has that \\"Ben Hillier sound\\" again: lots of blips and bleeps, processed guitar noise and blustery sfx - sometimes at the sake of a real melody. Or perhaps, a melody that's too familiar: how many times have we heard the descending-chord structure of 'Heaven'?? Overall, though, this is a perfect combination of \\"SOTU\\" and \\"Playing the angel\\" (production and sound) with a nice mix of \\"Violator\\" and \\"SOFAD\\" sensibilites. And Gahan! He's been on fire with his DM contributions as well as his own excellent solo releases. Three of my favorite songs on this album are Dave tunes (five, if you count the bonus tracks \\"Happens all the time\\" and \\"All that's mine\\")! Speaking of which, don't pass on the deluxe edition of this album despite the jacked-up price. The four b-sides are all dark 'n delicious, and less predictable than most of the rest of the album - DM letting themselves go a little bit, instead of opting for the usual. In all, one of their best - and after 30 years, who could really expect more!? (Message to Robert Smith: THE CURE should take note here!!) (Message to SONY: damn you for not releasing this in 5.1 DVD like ALL OF THEIR OTHER ALBUMS! It would have sounded FANTASTIC!)
0071766588|5.0|great
B00A0SJWQU|1.0|There was no fun in this movie.  It is standard action fare without a soul.  It didn't seem like anyone was having fun during this movie.  I thought the whole point is that you're in this dystopian future and you get whisked away on a high-action adventure full of ridiculous scenarios.  No, this is just all that action without the fun.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Playing this takes me back to the 80s when the Atari 2600 was the hot new game system. I hope this makes some of the younger gamers realize just how far we've come
B009RI4ZKC|2.0|A list of amazing actors? Check.  A cute, whimsical premise? Check.  Squandered by a story line that never really goes anywhere? Check!<br /><br />I think it's fine to have a moving where not a lot happens, but have what happens be truly meaningful or special...this movie just seemed to kick the can down the road the entire time.  I kind of understand that you're just looking at a microcosm of little situations and particular people's lives...but it never amounted to anything revealing or true for me.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|image was perfect. Movie is lovely, and quite true to the amazing book it's based on, just a tiny bit long.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|It's like what Glee was in in it's first season but way more clever. Hoping for a sequel.  Anna Kendrick is so awesome!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|We rented this for our 5 year-old and he loves it!!! Good clean movie and we're hoping to buy it for him when the price comes down a little bit!! Good family fun!
B0062A5RUA|5.0|I was pleasantly suprised how much I liked Apocalyptic Love. I am not a fan of Alter Bridge and wasn't sure what I'd think of it. It's a great album and reminds me of some early Guns-n-Roses. Now to hear Myles performing the Guns stuff live, this is the best thing to Guns you can get. Slashes playing is amazing, better than ever. And Myles nails it all. Especially the G-n-R songs. It's a great journey through Slash's career. I'm looking forward to a new album from Slash, Myles, and the Conspirators.
B004SKJTY6|1.0|I thought it was a full version movie, however, it was just a preview.  I tried to find the original movie, but I was not able to find it.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Just like the book but with some intense and well produced CGI scenes. The CGI animal behavior was very believable.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I love Colleen Hoover's work. I read this after 'Hopeless'. I was equally enthralled by her writing. Her characters come to life. This series has a refreshing storyline that is interesting and engaging. I loved aspects of humor, wit, and romance. The dialogue is clever and keeps you turning pages. I definitely did not expect the surprising twists and turns. It captures may real aspects of real life in an intimate and up close way.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i love playing this game because it gets you tense around every corner on there which makes people try to beat their old high scores on the first temple run and see any difference between the first and the second temple run
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Absolutely hot, mystifying story. It's an intense page turner! I loved the book from cover to cover! The characters were magnetic and made larger than life by the dialogue and movement in this story. I didn't want to put the book down. It was gripping and breath-taking.
B004SBX112|5.0|I could choke my kids and grandkids for hooking me on these stupid birds.  I'm not usually an electronic gamer, but Angry Birds keep me busy for hours.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I'm a beginner with these games, and the hints and tips helped guide me through it. Great graphics and storyline; I had fun working my way from scene to scene. Will definitely buy more of these!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I don't like this game quite as much as the original, but it's still fun.  I guess I'm just a simpler bird kind of person.
B00BHMF578|5.0|I can see why it won the Academy Award for Best Picture!  Suspense fill from start to finish.  Looks like I'll be buying this movie.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|Although it takes a little time to get used to the new twist on pigslaying, these darn birds are as addictive as ever. I haven't had much success in conquering the techniques required to score in this game, but it doesn't stop me from trying.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Everything I needed to know to publish my book for Kindle was right here in this easy-to-follow step-by-step guide book!  Even though it was my first time, I felt like a seasoned professional.  I highly recommend this book.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|I always enjoy the clear, beautiful voices of these lovely Irish women. Both the singing and the instrumentals are near perfection.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Reading this book was like an awesome rollercoaster!  I laughed, I got mad and I cried!  Well witten and now I just have to wait for the next one!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|If anyone had told me I'd become addicted to an electric game, I wouldn't have believed them. At the urging of my kids and grandkids, I gave these birds a go, and kept going.  My husband won't let me use the sounds, but they make the game even more fun. I'm angry at the birds for giving me one more reason to let my housework go.
B0031R5K72|4.0|Slow to start but once i got in to it a great story arrived!... Really enjoyed it... Would definitely recommend it to everyone...
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|As a retired middle school teacher, I always like to see what kids are reading. I'm not usually a sci-fi fan, but the Hunger Game series kept me fascinated. The stories are intriguing to a wide audience.  It's not often that a book series is enjoyed by a seventy-something former English teacher as much as it is by her grandchildren. These books will become classics.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|This book is exactly what the secret saga needed; the practical, daily application of the lessons brought forth in the first book. I think Rhonda Byrne has done an excellent job with this book. The daily reading of this book plus a schedule of waking up a little earlier each day has allowed me to find peace and joy before the busyness of the day starts. Well done!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Just finished the last one.  Loved the series.  At first I wasn't sure and then I had to keep going to find out what happens.  I loved the ending....
B00BUVPIRS|5.0|Presentation:<br />The game has a console quality setup with its menus and character creator. It looks like something Bethesda created, and that's a good thing. The menus will take some getting used to, but soon you will know where everything is.<br /><br />One issue I have is that your inventory is not broken up enough. The only categories are weapons, armor, and the \\"everything else\\" section named other. The other category becomes a little overwhelming, as your magic, food, potions, skins/items looted from enemies, etc. are all mashed into one area. It's not too bad, but after 6 or 7 hours with the game you will wish they added a potion and rune(magic) category to your inventory.<br /><br />The cut scenes are voice acted, but most of the characters you interact with only have one line of recorded dialogue and then all text. This is probably how Crescent Moon was able to keep the game to 551mb when Gameloft titles are coming in around 2gigs. For what it's worth, I was able to download and start playing Shadolwands in less than 10 minutes.<br /><br />The story is pretty traditional. You miraculously survived a war, and are told by the Archmage that you have descended from kings and it is your destiny to retrieve the Ravensword to seal away the dark demons trying to come from the Shadowlands. It's serviceable and kicks off your quest quickly. Quests are given by NPCs, so while there is the main mission always there, side missions like winning an archery tournament or collecting missing iron ingots for a black smith are plentiful, though not so much so that you fell lost amongst too many quests.<br /><br />Graphics:<br />There is no doubt the game is visually impressive. This is one of the first times I can recall actually stopping to marvel at some of the landscapes in a mobile game. From large open wastelands, to tree-laden mountain terraces with waterfalls, the game is large and immersive. It is Tegra 3 optimized and it shows. The draw distance is unparalleled for a mobile game, and real time shadows add an extra level of graphics on my Nexus 7 that are not there on the Galaxy S3. The S3 has more noticeable pop-in and texture issues in large open areas where it looks like shadows are flipping out all over the mountains in the distance.<br /><br />You will see clipping from time to time, and when you're inside if you turn against a wall very closely you may see through the wall for a second to a \\"sky.\\" It's minimal and has no real effect on the game. Your character is detailed and the armor you equip alters your look immediately. The enemies look good, especially up close. All in all, the graphics are a delight and add to the sense of scope the game presents, especially when you come across a rundown ruin on a hill and you feel like you've seen it before...in Oblivion.<br /><br />Gameplay:<br />Touch screen controls are always a point of contention, but for Ravensword they work well. Your attack button also functions as a block button, so hold to block with your shield and tap to swing your sword/axe/mace or shoot your bow. You may think this would cause issues with accidentally blocking when you meant to attack but this isn't the case. There is a slight issue with how often/quickly your character sheathes his weapon, as two seconds after one kill he sheathes it only to force you into a \\"pulling out your weapon\\" animation that may get you hit before you can block or attack the next enemy.<br /><br />You also have runes you can equip that allow you to cast magic like fire to burn enemies, ice that will freeze them in place and even a wind spell that lets you manipulate objects telepathically to solve puzzles. You can jump and roll dodge with the jump button. All the action buttons can be moved around manually to fit your comfort, but the quick slot panel (4 slots to assign things like different spells, potions, or mounts) cannot be moved, and neither can the mini map button, which is tough considering both are in the dead center of the screen. Not an issue on a phone, but definitely so on a 10\\" tablet.<br /><br />The game scales your stats as you use them, so you will get better with Blade by using swords, Blunt with maces, and so on. I have spent a considerable amount of time trying different builds, and can say that playing as a stealthy ranger is much different than playing as a pure melee or melee/magic builds.<br /><br />Food plays a part in the game as well, and it's important to know you need to carry food on you at all times. The game never really explains this, but you will get \\"hungry\\" which reduces your energy (magic and stamina combined) and health regeneration by half, then by 90% if you haven't eaten and move to \\"starving.\\" Because you can't choose to eat, it's arbitrary and simply put just carry food on you by either buying it from any of the general stores/inns, or killing and looting enemies that reward food like boars or dino cows.<br /><br />There are a variety of enemies to take down, from large and imposing to small and quick, and they will often assault you on sight and attack in groups. Crowd control becomes important, as a group of goblins will gang up on you quickly, so stealth builds need to sit back and try to quietly pick them off from afar, where melee/magic builds will need to plan their blocks accordingly and use fire magic to attack multiple enemies at once.<br /><br />Also, the game functions well in first or 3rd person, something that cannot be said for Crescent Moon's previous release, Aralon, as it was unplayable in first person. One thing that may stump some casual gamers is the lack of hand holding, as Shadowlands doesn't go far out of its way to let you know EXACTLY where you need to go next. I consider this a welcome change of pace from the \\"arrow above your head pointing you directly to your next objective\\" direction most games these days give you.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />The bottom line is that for the price of a value meal at Burger King, you're getting a game that brings you close to a console experience in your pocket. Take that for it's worth as that statement is subjective, but my time with Ravensword: Shadowlands has been impressive and well worth the $7 entry fee. Games like this need to be supported to ensure developers see value in the resources they spend crafting their product. Guess I'm not eating Burger King today...<br /><br />On the upside:<br />1. Graphically Stunning for a mobile game of this size<br />2. Lots of customization<br />3. Lengthy campaign (8-10 hrs) with plenty of reasons for replay<br /><br />Downs:<br />1. Some graphical issues due to Crescent Moon's own ambition<br />2. Not a ton going on in the open world as NPCs aren't very abundant or active<br /><br />Final Score: 8.5/10<br /><br />EDIT: I decided to add 5 tips for everyone getting started:<br /><br />1. Adventure! take the time to walk every inch of the beautiful environments, it's the only way to find chests and secrets you may miss if you're simply plowing through the main story. Talk to NPCs for extra quests and enter every building you can!<br /><br />2. Don't be afraid to grind a little. The enemies respawn when you fast travel, so if your current objective is blocked by enemies that are too powerful, warp somewhere else and do some fighting to level up, increase your skills, and add boosts to your talents. Luckily, grinding is very minimal and actually fun since the combat is engaging.<br /><br />3. Use your fire spell. Magic is not required to win in combat (though it is for a couple puzzles), but the fire spell, even if weak and you barely use it, is good for crowd control as it slows enemies as they move toward you.<br /><br />4. If you're low on cash, just fast travel to the Goblin Ruins, kill the goblins, pick up all their shields, and sell them at the store. In no time you will have the cash you need. Some people have complained that they included in-app purchases (you can buy gold and potions etc. withreal money), but they are not required in the least, and are really only for lazier players or players who have no real time to play the game.<br /><br />5. If you are stuck or unsure where to go next, feel free to leave a comment and I can help you out, or use google/youtube, BUT only after doing what I said in #1! It's a large game, so if you only really play left-to-right games, be patient, explore every option, and if all else fails, get yourself some help!<br /><br />I can't wait to see what the sequel to Aralon is like!u're getting a game that brings you close to a console experience in your pocket.

B00BEZTMWW|4.0|Peter Jackson.  Hobbits.  Rings.  Gollum.  What more could a fan ask more.  Another great film can't wait for the other 2.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved it. Now I must see the movie. It is nice to read a love story without all of the sex.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game. I can't wait for more updates though. It still has a long way to go to get as awesome as minecraft PC but is still an A+ game
1933492929|5.0|This book is absolute eye candy for artists.  I've been thinking of starting back up &#34;doodling&#34; and this book has given me the push to do so.  I love the colors and layout of the book and recommend it for any one who dreams of alternate beings and or reality.
B004WR125O|5.0|Switched to USB, plugged in adapter, connected with no issues. Signal strength 75%, going through two walls. Connected to a TX-8050
B000K4WPCM|5.0|Captivating to the very end with a plot that flows and holds your interest throughout--and worthy of a suspenseful sequel.
0451529065|5.0|Nothing wrong with the book at all, just wish I could have found this edition in anything but mass produced paperback. It's a wonderful work, and deserves to be on at least a standard paperback, and not a medium reserved mainly for cheesy romance novels.<br /><br />Not the product's fault, it's exactly what it says it is. Doesn't disappoint at all.
B00BI73CVI|4.0|I've never read Hugo's novel nor have I watched the musicals or any previous movie so the 2012 adaptation is my first exposure to Les Miserables...aside, of course, from references in academic studies. I'd have to say this was one great adaptation and captures the pathos of the post-Napoleonic era of France. I can't comment on how faithful it may be to Hugo's original story but I did listen to the musical versions after watching the movie and the rendition was epic. I have to compliment the vocal performances of Hathaway, Barks and Redmayne. Russell Crowe did his best, and by no means was it horrible...it's just his voice wasn't built for musicals. Reminded me of Gerard Butler as the Phantom in Phantom of the Opera. Jackman's acting prowess makes up for his lack of talent in his vocal performance (which was good but not great) and it is not too often that you see actors brave out a musical film with their own voice...instead of being dubbed in. The pleasant surprise was Sasha Baron Cohen; he was quite entertaining. The rousing Epilogue gives a grand picture of &#34;what might have been&#34; at the end and the conundrum of law and mercy, Javert and Valjean, resolved with the respective actors giving justice with their performances.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app breaks the Bible up into reading plans, if desired.  The plans are ideal for readers wishing to read a little bit each night or read according to theme.  I highly recommend!
B008JGSM6G|3.0|pretty easy and fun. would keep a younger person interested although i am advancing in the game so it may prove more challenging.
0307593525|4.0|specifically requested for Christmas by a family member.  has been enjoyed, but i have not used it, not a fan of french cooking
B005HSL626|4.0|i really like this game and it challenges you on your speed and agility in keeping up!! was fun and played with a friends daughter and we had a good time. fun for any age!
B004ODLUGM|5.0|I highly recommend this original and the sequel.  Both are beautiful to watch, entertaining for children and adults and have a wonderfully written storyline.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I have not stop playing this game.  It is one of the better games I have played in a while.  well worth the download.
0142405809|5.0|I have purchased many of Ms. Donaldson's books and the movies based on them and am always amazed.  They are all well written stories for both children and adults to enjoy.  This one especially has a wonderful theme of how we don't all need to be the same to learn from and to help each other and how we can all enjoy the world together.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. It's a well written peek into some of the dark, harsh realities of life in North Korea. It is an exciting read with many twists and turns yet amidst the chaos a love story manages to find it's way. Very enjoyable.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Perfect holiday &#34;album&#34;. It was purchased for my husband as a gift and someone in the extended family decided to borrow it forever.  We had to buy a 2nd one.
B0002KPIQY|5.0|I enjoyed the movie. I loved this movie. It was so real. I learned a lot about modeling and drugs
B00BHMETKC|3.0|I like Ben but this movie was a little disappointing. Sound quality was very poor. It was difficult to understand conversations and then the music would overwhelm. Video was made to look like it came from the 70's which it made it difficult to watch.<br /><br />The pluses: Cameos by 70's stars, President Carter's added narration in the end credits, Alan Arkin and John Goodman.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|This is awesome chopping of zombies heads and being a samurai two awesome things in one you have to get this game
B0026KX6TY|5.0|ITS ONE OF THOSE MOVIES IF ITS ON TV I AM GONNA WATCH IT. IF YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN IT ITS WELL WORTH THE TIME.
B0030GIQM0|5.0|We are talking about the one of the greatest groups ever. Enough said! I have two young children...7 & 6. They loved the them.
B00A4NWSDK|4.0|He continues to keep us on our toes by mixing up his song styles.  I really like that about him!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Such a good book!!! I think it's better than the first one!! The movie is coming out this year so if you want to see the movie, read the book first.
B005K17RU0|5.0|It is so easy to understand and it tells you more than weather.and if you are in a herry get will tell you really guick!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun game me and my sister play my horse<br />This game is totally worth it.it's fun and easy to compete.
B005LAJ1O0|2.0|Not what I had expected and too difficult to follow.  This was recommended by a friend and I am not happy that I wasted my purchase..  I will  not watch anymore after fewing the first two shows.  I like good suspenseful shows but this was too far out.  I should have known with the Horror in title however I have watched and enjoyed some horror shows,  just not this.
B0002KQNUO|5.0|It was a gift for my grand-daughter .. She loved it,<br /><br /> she is a cirque du soleil fan..We bought lanouba in Florida and paid more$$... Yes it met our expectations....
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Wonderful performance by one of my favorite actors!  A great story of loss and redemption.  Portrays an affliction that is common to many but difficult to overcome.
B005HSL626|2.0|I found this to be one of the most boring games out there (and I play FarmVille!). It wasn't worth a free download.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Action packed and full of James Bond tricks and acrobatics from the moment the movie starts.  A great move for all James Bond fans.
B002TU1Q3Y|5.0|I first read this novel forty years ago.  In the subsequent decades I have read a good deal of miltary history, especially dealing with RAF Bomber Command.  I am now reading 'Bomber' on my Kindle and this novel holds up very well.  Deighton has clearly done his research very thoroughly and, in addition to painting a gripping picture of the air war and those involved in it, I can find very few errors in his depiction of the conflict.  If you want to know how the bomber campaign was carried out against Germany, read this book.  Please remember that over 55,000 young men of Bomber Command lost their lives in the conflict.
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|This movie is definitely not one I would recommend.  Waste of time in my opinion.  The story line was lost in all the garbage.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|The movie was great and the book even better. The movie gives an overview of what went on in these people's minds, the book gives a much better understanding, so funny at  times and then just very sad.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I found it was far superior to bejeweled 2 and it was free. I would highly recommend this game. I know you will love it as much as i did.
B005K17RU0|5.0|For a weather forecast they are as accurate as any, The only thing is the site is very busy with information which can be good, it depends on the person.
B00BDAP66E|4.0|but has some glitches were it doesn't load right away or takes forever...<br />I'm glad it finally exists though, so those of us with pages can actually manage their page while mobile.
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|If you have found this story for the first time, please read it! If you have found it for class and are dreading it, it is a quick and easy read, and there is tons of breakdowns and anayises online, just check youtube for them. I do advise reading it though!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very well written, very enjoyable.  I'm glad I came to it as an omnibus, it would have driven me mad waiting for new chapters.  I look forward to reading any promised prequels or sequels.  Worth the asking price and then some.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is officially my drug. I am so frustrated by how slow the storyline goes sometimes but I still can't get enough of it. I hate my job because I work on Sundays and can't see the new episodes! Yeah, my addiction is bad.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|The way Facebook shows on my Kindle is the way it was on my old phone.  I didn't like it and I'm not crazy about this.  I'll stick to my IPhone.
B00AL8F5EM|3.0|I would recommed this book as it gives you a basic overview of bilingualism.It is also good to have ideas on what to do with the children
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This game is pretty intriguing, not too hard but not too easy. Has a few surprises and I enjoyed playing it.
0547848412|5.0|I gave this copy to my grand daughter for her 14th birthday.  Now I have to order one for me.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|These books are soooo addicting!! Glad I have bought all 3 so I can read them again later! A must read!!!
B00AJF87QU|4.0|This is a tough review to write because I love this band so much, but in general this is not going to be a CD for everyone. For people in the states that don't know much about this band, what you need to know is they are pretty big in Europe, sell out arena's and sometimes stadiums and headline the biggest festivals overseas.  In the US, they are sadly a blip on the radar. Pop culture here has past them by.<br /><br />The best way to sum up this CD is with one word - experimental. The band really does have a very \\"pop\\" vibe and sound to them in a slightly heavier, rock-n-roll sort of way. They steer away from that on this CD.  That doesn't make it bad, it is just different.  It is much more creative and I don't think the band cares a ton if the fans like it or not, they are at a phase where they are tired of trying to make a record that they think people will like.  Instead they have made something THEY like and if the fans like it too, all the better.<br /><br />For me, I like it and appreciate it but it was only on heavy rotation in my car for a few days.  It is a very moody record. Some of their CD's and I can pop in at anytime and I'm into it. This release is different.  Listening to it in the car in a casual way doesn't really cut it.  It needs to be, begs to be, played LOUD. With headphones and a drink or three...even better.<br /><br />If you are into Stereophonics I would not hestitate to buy it. If you are not into them and considering this for your first purchase, I would check out some of their earlier stuff first unless you are a risk taker and will enjoy the sound of a band reinventing themselves, or at least trying to reinvent themselves.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|It seems simple enough: have the water droplets move vertically and horizontally to grab the silver and gold orbs. Beneath this simplicity is a great puzzler! There are different objects that can harm you, blocks that you can move, and teleporters that will launch you to different areas. Did I mention that  the edge of each area loops you to the opposing edge? Challenging, fun, and entertaining! Highly recommended.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This product exceeded my expectation.  I was slow to catch on to all the rave about the series.  I am now hooked!!!
B001AQR3JY|5.0|Great price for an awesome classic! My son is getting this in his Easter basket, can't wait to watch it with him!!!
B00AF6B22E|5.0|ANOTHER WINNER FROM DENZEL WASHINGTON: THIS IS ANOTHER GREAT PERFORMANCE YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE YOU ARE OR HOW'S THE MOVIE WILL WIND UP UNTIL THE LAST 10 MIN!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Boring unless u know how to play each and every game.  Almost impossible to do. Boring boring. Learning is most of the fun but nit these games.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Love the book, can't put it down. Can't wait for the next one. That's it that's all I got to say
B0037TPMOA|4.0|Absolute classic, though I much prefer Stanley Kubrick's ending. One of King's top two or three novels. Looking forward to the upcoming sequel!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|read them all, and enjoyed his writing tremendously!  They also made great movies in both languages (although you really needed to read the books first)
B00BKEMX28|2.0|i'm a massive NIN fan. They were all i listened to in highschool. That's not a broad generalization, I literally only listened to NIN. the occasional radio drivel would be permitted only to add sweetness to the next NIN track. It was like audio absinthe for me.<br /><br />I excitedly got the first how to Destroy Angels CD after hearing/seeing their song/video \\"The Spaces In Between.\\" I dug it! and hey, look, a dead Trent Reznor Cameo, that's sweet! but i felt like the entire album had this shadow of Trent on it. Like you could see them in the studio, him a sort of Phantom of the Opera, coaxing out her words.  I didn't feel like anything she was singing was her own.<br /><br />Flash forward to this new album, and it feels even more forced to me. This is just an opinion, so take it with a grain of salt. Maybe this will not bother you.  But Trent Reznor is ALL over this album.  There are a few songs in particular where i feel you can hear Mariqueen's own musical predilections spring forth, and they really don't seem as tragic or broken as Trent's world, and that's okay! I guess my complaint is that between Trent's ghostly vocals appearing in about half of the tracks, and the overall direction of the album (it's very \\"With Teeth\\"), I feel like he's not giving Mariqueen a fighting chance to establish her own sound.  It's all a little disheartening.  Alright, that's it. I hope you feel differently and can enjoy it more than I have. i just feel bad for her.
1594203334|5.0|I expected this to be kind of a gimmicky sort of book that I would abandon after a few chapters. Instead, I found myself reading it aloud to my husband and feeling empowered to define myself as the kind of mother I always wanted to be but didn't have the courage to be, given our culture's seemingly endless demands for parents' self sacrifice.<br /><br />I think it boils down to the fact that Americans generally live under a dangerous illusion of control, and when it comes to kids, this starts even before conception. If we only do X, Y and Z, our children will end up at an Ivy League school. But \\"X, Y and Z\\" gets way out of hand. After reading this book, I am joining the chorus of \\"Let him live his life.\\"<br /><br />My son started potty training the other week, and I found myself tiring of sitting with him for hours in the bathroom, distracting him with books and convincing him that he needed to go. I started pulling back a little, connecting with \\"French Mom\\" and trusting that his body (in all its innate, wonderful wisdom) would tell him what he needed to do and when.<br /><br />Before long, he was announcing his success from the bathroom. I was enjoying a magazine.
B0053TMP24|5.0|It was super funny<br />Great book and I thought that it was an other hit and that everyone should read this book!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Addicting games are always the best and this game....is Addicting get it get it get it no second thoughts just get it
B006MW3UZW|5.0|You might need to have an interest in the particular time period that Downton Abbey is based on, but it is quite entertaining.  There are numerous underlying plots, and they have the same effect as those in traditional soap operas.  Acting is very well done.  This is one of the better PBS presentations in my opinion.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Game is fun to play.  The levels progress quickly but predictably.  When you start the game it says &#34;headphones recommended&#34; and I do recommend this as well.  The soundtrack is great, the ambient sound corresponds well with the gameplay.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I watched Season 1 on Netflix not realizing that there were two more seasons until I looked it up on Amazon. I just had to get all three seasons so I could get caught up.
B009KEN87O|3.0|Game is OK.  Gameplay is decent, progressive levels.  Not a fan of the \\"retro\\" look that seems to be popular.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|For \\"Castle\\" fans it's easy to picture Rook and Heat as Castle & Beckett.  Lots of humor and one-liners as I expected. A quick, easy read, but still mildly suspenseful.  The cleverly written dialog was enjoyable, also.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This is a fun game to play when you have a few minutes to spare. Great mental puzzle work to help keep me sharp. Somewhat addictive.
B0000062FL|5.0|This is an amazing album with every song just gels perfectly.  The band puts together a deep percussion driven groove that allows Carlos Santana's guitar to seem to float effortlessly above.  The three live tracks on the end give the album a broader perspective and further demonstrates Santana's virtuosity both as a live and studio act.  The individual tracks come from a variety of different styles, but Santana takes each one of these and makes it distinctly his own.
B001IBIHQ4|1.0|I will not buy this movie simply because of Tom Hanks.When he was on the road publizing this he would not appear on any FOX Network show and when he was on MSNBC all he did was make fun and ridicule the Tea Party and spout off his far left position on politics instead of the movie.Granted he is a good actor but I will not buy anything with his name on it.  Semper Fi
B000001DTM|5.0|One of U2 finest with all the cool electronic sensibilities of David Bowie and a surprisingly funky beat.  As Bono's lyrics move from the political on previous albums to the personal and his voice also changes from earnest to soulful.  The album is a delight; fun, upbeat and danceable.
B00BMCLCG6|4.0|Im not a music critic. I am a Bon Jovi fan. People are being way to hard on this record though i think it has its low points and high points . The single is probably the worst song on this cd and if you've heard that and are a bon jovi fan dont fret go out and get this. This record is just as strong musically and i think if you've heard richies most recent solo record you were begging to here him sing lead on this record ... it didnt happen . but go out and get this pleassse
B000002UB3|5.0|This the final masterpiece from one of the greatest group at the height of their powers.  The album is tighter in construction than the White Album and it feels like a step forward from that with many new and innovative ideas.  Let it Be (recorded before Abbey Road, but released after) was the Beatles only misstep in their entire career.  Abbey Road put them back on track and let them break up at the height of their artistic and creative ability.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love that you can go back and view the history in case you make a mistake or lose your place while calculating.
B00BF123WG|4.0|REALITY !!!!<br /><br />Kathryn Bigelow has produced a masterpiece ... Authentic and well researched .<br /><br />overall a true life depiction.  excellent!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I have a Plantronics Discovery 975 that has a charging case.  I was disappointed that none of the earlier Voyager headsets had  the same thing.  Being able to go days at a time between A/C connections is freeing.<br /><br />The only thing I haven't quite figured out is how the USB cord fits in neatly. &#60;grin&#62;
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I read this book in one sitting. It is a page turner. I was ensconced in the book from the first page. I enjoyed all the characters and experienced many emotions while reading. This book surprised me and being that I read over 100 books a year, that's saying a lot.
B0043URV5U|5.0|You cannot beat the value in this collection of truly classic hits! Even those who don't know Bob Seger will recognize many of his hits!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game is great! The storyline is interesting and the graphics are awesome! I can't wait to play more Big Fish Games!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I read this book in two days and have been thinking about it ever since.  The writing is a work of art.  It is a spoof that appeals to the intellect.  While it is funny and unbelievable in parts, it is also complex in history.  It made me drag out my encyclopedia and read up on several historical issues.  I have already recommended it to a friend who needed a book choice for her book club.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I LOOOVEE this app so much!!!!!!!!!!! This is perfect for editing your pics and sharing them to all you're friends and family. It also has some amazing stickers and other cool and fun stuff to add to your pics!!!!! Hop everybody likes it!!!!!!! ENJOY!!!!!!!!

B006MW3V6U|5.0|So delicious like an English muffin toasted to perfection with just the right amount of melted butter.  It is comfort food. .
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is an amazing survival game and the best part is that this is free!also the game has the great white shark which can eat anything which adds amazing features. You also level up your shark by eating more and more.
B003IEJZUG|5.0|Whatever one faces, if we endure and believe in God, we can get through anything, just as possible did. Great story with many tools to confront the many trials of life.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Downloads fast for me and the play was good. Hard time loading my friends page through FB while on . Kindle but I don't mind. Thanks for being free!!!
B00BRR66SA|3.0|Great album but you can tell he rushed through it. Wasn't what I expected and previous albums were better. Justin an amazing artist and has incredible talent and I noticed he isn't into making music anymore. Bit that's just my opinion.
B001B51B9M|5.0|I've now watched this movie six or eight times, and it never fails to leave me in a good mood.  Robert Preston puts on a hell of a performance, and the rest of the cast is pretty good, too.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|The trailer caught my attention and I thought, at least the special effects should eye pleasing. They definitely didn't disappoint. But I was also completely drawn into the story line. Very, very, very good movie!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|This movie is awesome and I could wait for the extended, but extended doesn't always mean better.  I love that they filled in details with information about this time from other Tolkien books because it makes the world feel much more well rounded.  I may still get the extended too, but I really want to watch it again with my son who is too young to sit still in a theater for very long.  My only complaint would be about Amazon's service with this item.  If I preorder, I want it sooner.  7 days post release and it hasn't shipped.  Thanks, but I've had multiple opportunities to buy it elsewhere, get it sooner and not have it cost any more. Have another opportunity today, so I think I'll take it.  Amazon lost a sale that was already made. I won't be doing any movie preorders with Amazon.
B00005JLT5|3.0|dvd is a bit faulty...freezes frequently...skips....not enough aggrevation to return it but know I'll never attempt to watch it again. very disappointing
B007REV4YI|5.0|Finding it boring watching it the 2nd time.  I really don't know what happen to James Bond and the franchise.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|The boxed set is well done.  The packaging fits well alongside the first season's boxed set.  I enjoyed the series although I felt that the plot lines were sometimes stretched thin and the action sequences were a bit weak.  The sets and costumes had an authentic feel and the production value was good.  It is a must have set for those fans who got hooked on the first season.  Although I don't think this second season was quite up to the standards of the first, it was still enjoyable and entertaining.
B000031WBV|5.0|The more I listened to Rubinstein, the more I understand his greatness.  No amount of words can describe the joy of listening to his piano repertoire.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This is a great book for all women to read. I definitely recommend it for any woman looking for a good read.
B0094K1QR8|2.0|Too silly, I wdidn't like itas bored, my husband could not see even ten minutes, not good at all. I
B001H1SVO8|5.0|At this point in time, please refer to Rule #1.<br />If you are still reading this, refer to Rule #2.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love, love, love this series! From the setting to the costumes to the actors to the drama, I cannot get nearly enough Downton, it's addicting!
B005C5SJ1U|5.0|This superbly directed movie features some fine acting and a very believable storyline. The genre that this movie would categorize into is \\"intense drama.\\" I watched this movie because of the high rating on Amazon and I was not disappointed!If you like this movie you will likely also enjoy \\"Hawaii, Olso\\" and the Israeli movie \\"The Bubble\\".
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Is desperate for MORE!  Awesome story!  Can't wait to move on (again) to book 3! XO  Thanks for a great read.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Davis does a good job of explaining the problems caused by wheat and other glutinous foods. Learned a lot, and now even more committed to low carb and wheat free living.
0316228532|4.0|There are moments you want to push it away; there are moments you wonder what else you could have done with $35; there are moments when you see the train wreck coming and want to look away; there is the realization the story is brilliant; and there are hours when the characters will enter your dreams.  In the end, an almost impossible conclusion celebrates the characters previously denigrated in the rest of the book.<br /><br />It might be bitterly cold when you jump in but you will get used to the temperature.<br /><br />A character chart behind the cover would have helped this book.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|I don't like even the movie at all .. .. .. ... .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Vikings is a faithfully reproduced saga of life among the nordic warriors who raided from England throughout the Mediterranean and into the depths of Russia during the 700s - 800s AD. The cinematography of fjords and water cascades is striking, but the narrative is one of stark violence; the ever-present reality of Viking life. The story, however, and its depiction of its main character, Ragnar, is told skillfully. The viewer sees much more than mortal combat and pillage; it is also a sociological statement about kinship, extended family life, love and the dictates of a war-worshiping society in a sparse and poverty-stricken land. In spite of the carnage, the viewer comes to appreciate the strength, intelligence and familial grit of the main character and his loving wife and son. Still, if if you find yourself in a in a tough spot don't ask, &#34;What would Ragnar do?&#34;
B007XIO9TU|5.0|I once interviewed Johnny Winter for a popular Native American magazine. One of my questions to him was, &#34;Have you ever played in Japan?&#34;. His reply was, &#34;No, I haven't played there yet, but I'll get around to it one of these days&#34;. Well, he kept true to his word and this concert is the proof. Johnny and his band really burns at this concert and Japanese blues fans get a real treat here. Actually, we are all treated here if we purchase this well produced DVD and witness the blues master at work. Johnny Winter is one of the last great Blues players still alive and producing great music at venues around the World. You have to see Johnny live to really appreciate his talent and ability. And, if you're unable to catch him live, this DVD is the next best thing. Go out and purchase it today, not tomorrow. You'll be glad you did. Long live Johnny Winter!
B0091REZMW|5.0|good game I like hidden object games. if you like them too this is the game for you. very good graphics
B008KP6ENE|4.0|At the beginning of the game it is really fun but at the castle it is impossible and when I beat the hard part I only had 1 heart left so I die later in the level. On a scale of 1 to 10 I would pick the number 7.
1416550550|3.0|The book is intricately plotted and told from 3 points of view. However, the entire story rests on one concept: that a young \\"adopted\\" girl, learning her true heritage, turns away from her adopted family and financee and lives a rather unhappy life (which unfolds the rest of the plot). I simply found it unbelievable that in a male-dominated Australian society where women did not possess the vote (or have many rights), that a young woman would reject her loving father and family which she had heretofore adored. Her behavior seemed incongruent with that of a lower class Victorian girl living in Australia in the early 1900s. I read this novel for a book club and found myself longing for the novels of Susan Howatch, \\"The Rich are Different,\\" \\"Sins of the Fathers,\\" \\"Cashelmara,\\" and \\"Pendorric.\\" In those novels the characters, if rebellious or not, seem more congruent to their natures and possess historical veracity. Plainly, they, despite individual idiosyncracies, behave appopriate to their relative periods, Victorian or otherwise.

B009AMANBA|5.0|This film is simply mind blowing. The acting is superb, the writing is magnificent, and the production quality is outstanding. Day-Lewis' interpretation of Lincoln was simply breathtaking, and the supporting cast does a fantastic job. This movie is entertaining and engaging from start to finish. It portrays Lincoln in a new and interesting light, one that is all to often forgotten, that of a skilled, and somewhat devious diplomat. It also displays what Lincoln's home life was, which is also often not included in films about this incredible man. Worth watching again and again!

B001IMFHTS|5.0|No need to wonder or doubt, Abbado is a master! And we all know about Beethoven. This is quintessential Beethoven and the reduced forces unlike earlier period music don't bother me here; they enhance the music and the perception of the inner parts and counterpoint. On that Italian tour the Berliners were in fine form and so inspired at times. Just watch and listen to the string players when that powerful scherzo of The Fifth in the third movement soars into the Finale. They are just loving the theme and bowing. It seems even more powerful then recordings I have of larger orchestras. Certainly when that was first performed IF the orchestras of Beethoven's time did it anything like this, it was one of the GREATEST Moments in Western Music History.<br /><br />Yes, this set is a bargain and a fine overview of the 9. I have yet to see Abbado truly stumble. I can rely on him, so can you.

There's a lot of complaints that it's too long, that there isn't a lot of action... well there isn't a lot of action but this movie is introducing us to a lot of Dwarves and setting up the rest of the journey.  I loved it, I love this world PJ has created and I cannot wait for The Desolation of Smaug in December.  If you loved the LOTR films then you will like/love this film.  If you couldn't sit through the LOTR films then this film won't do it for you.

B00B1E6FF8|4.0|It's just really suspenseful even though we know the outcome.  Just brilliant acting all around and the scenes of the raid at the end were really just brilliantly done. I was on the edge of my seat although we know what happens.  Watch the film, it's really good.
B002RPR6DU|4.0|Even though I was born in the 80's, Joan Baez sounds great.  However, the plot feels like it was forced too much towards a moral message, and while the message is not bad, it was made at the expense of the plot.
B000ZKL2DO|4.0|I pretty much wore out the vinyl version of this disk when I owned it years ago.  Alvin Lee was an amazing guitarist and this live set showcased his talents as well as those of the rest of Ten Years After.  For whatever reason, I never bought the CD version so hadn't listened to this one in a very long time.  Having revisited it as MP3 downloads, it's just as good as I remember it.  My only quibble is that The Hobbit was cut from the CD version, apparently, so it also missing on the MP3 version.<br /><br />In any case, this is a must-have for Ten Years After fans, IMO.

B00B2270P8|5.0|THIS IS THE WAY I SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE THEATER.<br />THOUGHT THE ADDITIONS WERE GREAT AND WOULD EVEN MORE.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|I have been listening to Depeche Mode ever since their single Dreaming of Me became a minor hit in 1981. Although they constantly came up with great singles, I found their albums as a whole more as a set of songs that ranged from being great to being anything but great. This began changing gradually with Black Celebration showing signs of the band creating a distinctive and cohesive sound. Despite finding Music for the Masses being rather bleak when initially released, time has proved that it had a perfect blend of a dark sonic landscape but yet very melodic tunes. The album maybe more importantly at the time was a definite starting point in the masses taking Depeche Mode more seriously as an album act. When they thus followed it up with Violator and the MTV friendly Enjoy the Silence the group had evolved into being one of the biggest groups in the world and deservedly so. That album is still among my all-time favorites.<br /><br />While their less synth follow-up, Songs of Faith and Devotion, was from my standpoint an uneven project and somewhat a disappointment, I really loved Ultra, which was made in the shadow of David Gohan's drug problems and Alan Wilder leaving the band. Ultra was as if Depeche Mode had some point to prove and songs like It's No Good and Home are simply classics. After having hit such a high another let-down was in store with Exciter, a bland and unloved release. During the last decade Depeche Mode have released two albums, both in my view decent efforts, especially Playing the Angel. They were not great but still amazing considering how long the three core members have worked together. Their sales were, however, rather disappointing.<br /><br />Their latest release, Delta Machine, has thus not been extremely anticipated. The lead track, Heaven, may though have increased the anticipation because it is among their strongest songs ever, hitting a balance of raw energy and still the classic Depeche Mode synth sound. I pre-ordered Delta Machinenot only because it is a Depeche Mode release but have been excited about their new sound, hoping that Heaven is not a flux on the album. In the week before its release, Depeche Mode have made it available to listen on iTunes and Spotify, giving me an opportunity to listen to it several times. This is becoming rather common, adding excitement to new releases. This strategy could, however, backfire since if people's reaction and thus word of mouth is negative, some may pull back their pre-orders. There should be no such concern regarding Delta Machine.<br /><br />In short, this album is among DM's best ever release; how on earth do they still make such good music after three decades together? The production is brimming with energy, hitting a perfect balance between their classic style and yet with with new sounds still entering the frame. It is rather alike the sound on Ultra but slightly more complex, not as straightforward, and overall a more lush atmosphere despite having raw elements.<br /><br />This is evident in the opening track, Welcome to My World, a slow stylish track that moves assuredly but yet has many instruments (and vocals) that work perfectly together. The next track, Angel, is not unlike Heaven, rather slow beat count wise but has a very strong melody (listen how the they add the numbers of beats during the later part of the song); which leads to Heaven itself, one of their best tracks. The first possibly radio friendly track follows, the excellent Secret to the End, which is rocks in DM style and is practically impossible to get out of ones head. My Little Universe follows, a track that could easily have been on their previous two releases and would definitely had been one of the highlights of those releases. Slow follows, a rather bluesy track, not one of the strongest tracks on DM but yet among their stronger ones in their career. It is a grower. Broken and The Child Inside come next; these are the weakest tracks on DM, sort of come and go without an impact. Soft Touch / Raw Nerve gets things moving again, as the title indicates a rather raw and energetic track. Should Be Higher comes next; another radio friendly track with a fantastic chorus. Alone is very moody while Sooth My Soul is the opposite, both good tracks but not yet among the highlights (Sooth My Soul is still a single contender - addition: is actually being released as a single, has traces of Personal Jesus). Among the highlights is, however, the final song, Goodbye. The guitar in the song reminds me somewhat of Freestate, among my favorites of Ultra. Goodbye may, however, be even better, a slow track and probably the best singing of the whole album; what a way to finish it.<br /><br />Of the 13 songs on DM, there are in my opinion thus two so-so tracks, with the rest ranging evenly from being good to fantastic.<br /><br />Below is a list of my favorite Depeche Mode albums. Time may obviously change my opinion in either direction regarding Delta Machine but most often albums tend to grow on people. Ultra may gain the edge after a while; I have difficulties choosing between those two for second spot. Those who beg to differ on what constitutes great Depeche Mode albums probably may have different ideas than I do regarding Delta Machine. I may sound like a commercial, but those in a similar DM wavelength as I am should absolutely not let Delta Machine pass them by.<br /><br />1. Violator<br />2. Delta Machine<br />3. Ultra<br />4. Music For the Masses<br />5. Playing the Angel<br /><br />Addition April 11, 2013 - This rather slow & moody album has been in constant rotation since I initially wrote this review. It is without doubt their best release since Violator. Also, while the Deluxe version looks very nice, the extra tracks are obvious inferior B-side candidates.

B003IHUHYG|1.0|I love this movie, but I could not play this product in my player since it is not a Region 1 DVD...I've never had a problem with purchasing DVDs from Amazon until I did so through the MovieMars company.  When I told them it wouldn't play in my DVD, the email sent to me said I would need to pay the costs for shipping before any action could be done and that it was listed properly; it does discuss the regional codes on the listing, but who from the United States would buy a DVD that doesn't play in that region--why would this be offered for people from the United States?  Ridiculous!  My rating is for the company, not the movie itself!  You should reconsider before buying anything from MovieMars.
B00A2DOKLU|5.0|This trilogy is so mellow. The Weeknd is reminiscent of Janet Jackson with his high notes and falsetto. However, his style is something I've never heard before. He is a genuinely new artist. His songs are sexy and they draw you in. Even his lyrics make you think.

B00BDZV7WQ|3.0|[[ASIN:B00BDZV7WQ I Am Not a Human Being II DLX EX]] serves as Lil Wayne's follow-up to 2010s [[ASIN:B00437DYLI I Am Not A Human Being]].  Like any Lil Wayne album, it is completely outrageous and over-the-top.  The problem is this go-round, Lil Wayne is completely overwrought and at times over-recycles previous ideas; he doesn't always sound fresh.  Many of the MC's signature topics are afloat (women, substances, violence), but often the stupidity and crass nature of the rhymes can turn off even the most avid hip-hop fan. It's by no means a horrid album, but it definitely falls short of Tha Carter series and paints the MC as incredibly immature.<br /><br />\\"IANAHB\\" opens the effort, finding Lil Wayne accompanied by dramatic piano that musically 'punches' when he does lyrically.  His risqu&eacute; endeavors are present from the start, with Wayne making every sensual allusion he can including one at the conclusion in regards to the piano.  On \\"Curtains\\", Weezy channels his inner `Future', pop-rapping through autotune.  Weezy is incredibly salacious here, perverting Chick-fil-a and attaining extra 'nastiness' from guest collaborator Boo.  \\"Days and Days\\" returns the MC to rapping sans autotune and sounds more 'signature', lifted by superb production by Cool & Dre and a brief guest spot from 2 Chainz.  \\"Gunwalk\\", similarly is strong, but does suffer from Wayne's controversial stance on gun control/violence: \\"I'm strapped up [...] a gun law / see me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk...\\" Weezy is discontent to leave pistols just as they are, taking it to the next level by comparing it to anatomy.<br /><br />\\"No Worries\\" is familiar and a crowd-pleaser, aided by Detail's production work.  Weezy manages a solid punch-line or two, specifically \\"I know gold-diggers and ditch-diggers / you don't get dissed you get disfigured...\\"  Unfortunately, the five-and-a-half minute \\"Back To You\\" misses, with Lil Wayne clumsily going 'small' with all things lascivious.  What's worst is he choose to approach his sensual desires as a pop-rap, ballad.  \\"Trigger Finger\\" isn't quite atonement, but much more bearable.  The two clumsiest aspects of \\"Trigger Finger\\"? Wayne references sizzurp (bad timing) and Soulja Boy's silly guest verse. \\"Beat The...\\" is violent, much like \\"Gunwalk\\" but less satisfying.  \\"Rich As...\\" proceeds, featuring the assist from 2 Chainz on the hook.  The most redeeming qualities of \\"Rich As...\\" are the references to other songs, including Wayne's own \\"No Worries\\" and Chief Keef's \\"I Don't Like\\".  Disturbing are the drug references.<br /><br />\\"Trippy\\" is all about 'trees', featuring Juicy J.  Mike Will Made It's production on the popular single \\"Love Me\\" is brilliant, and the hook by Future and Drake is the biggest selling point.  Lil Wayne's pop-raps are ok, but it's the hook that really electrifies.  Some deluxe versions feature the clumsy \\"Romance\\", which derails the true meaning/feeling of the word; it is a new low, even for Lil Wayne. \\"God Bless Amerika\\" isn't too shabby and generally has a better message than the multitude.  That said, Lil Wayne can't keep things completely appropriate, even for one cut.  \\"Wowzers\\" message is as expected - the bedroom.  Soulja Boy delivers great production while Lil Wayne spits some of the nastiest rhymes ever. Adding to the sinfulness is none other than rap's riskiest female MC, Trina.  \\"Hello\\", featuring Shane Heyl closes clumsily, reminiscing back to the MC's [[ASIN:B001TD1XWG Rebirth]] days.<br /><br />The Deluxe version (in addition to \\"Romance\\" on some editions), features three other cuts.  \\"Lay It Down\\" is a winner, featuring guest verses from Gunplay and Nicki Minaj.  The production is superb by all means. \\"Hot Revolver\\" misses, but early single \\"My Homies Still\\" proves why it should have graced the standard version.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B00BDZV7WQ I Am Not a Human Being II DLX EX]]  is 'good enough' but not a great Lil Wayne album. It doesn't bomb, but it also doesn't captivate like say [[ASIN:B001E4IY3Q Tha Carter III]].  Too often the rhymes aren't truly thoughtful, just sounding like a vulgar, ludicrous mess. The production is hot, even some of the hooks, but at times 'Lil Tunechi' just sounds lukewarm at best.  3 Stars.te like say [[ASIN:B001E4IY3Q Tha Carter III]].

B000FA675C|2.0|I'm not going to bother getting into the \\"historical accuracy\\" arguments about this book.  It's a novel, for crying out loud. Regardless of its author's claims about dealing in facts, it never occurred to me to even consider reading a NOVEL in search of historical truth.<br /><br />The problem with the DaVinci Code is not whether it's historically accurate. The problem is that Dan Brown's writing is terrible.. Seriously - how is it that no one else is talking about this?  Here is a classic case of an author who has come up with a brilliant and engaging story, but lacks the skill to put it onto paper in an even remotely readable way.<br /><br />And yes, I read through the whole thing ... every single god-awful page of it. I admit that I was interested enough in these characters to want to know what happened next. But I was constantly yanked out of the narrative flow by Mr. Brown's awkward, vague, and repetitive writing style.<br /><br />Truthfully, the writing was so painfully bad that the only way I could stand it was to turn it into a game. Every time I found an especially stinky passage I would run to my mother (who was also reading the book) and read it aloud so that we could have a good laugh. Whoever found the most awkward, cringe-inducing sentence won the game for the day. Some days there were too many to choose from, and we called it a tie.<br /><br />Should you read this book? Sure, why not? But don't say I didn't warn you.

B0093OGBL6|5.0|I had this book for Christmas, and I read it in a day, I just could not put it down.<br />It showed a side of Michael that, even as a fan of 21 years I never knew. It was beautifully moving, and I only wish that this could be more widely publicised, as the Media at large will forever portray \\"Wacko Jacko\\" rather than the caring and painfully lonely man he was.<br /> It made me laugh, it made me gasp in awe at what he had to deal with in his life, and it made me cry over just how lonely he was in his soul and how pointless his death truly was.<br />I had the good fortune to meet him many years ago, and I asked him for a hug which he happily gave.<br /> I told him that day that as long as I breathed he would never be alone, and he held me even tighter and said thank you.<br />I wish to the Lord above I hadn't let him go now, but I feel we simply must show the world that he was a great man more than just musically. For too long we have seen only one side of the story, and I simply cannot thank Karen Moriarty enough for all that she has done and continue to do.<br /> I would recommend this book to any Michael Jackson fan, or to anyone who has ever wondered not just how many of the rumours about MJ were true, but about the evidence used to back up the claims about his supposed insanity.

When you finish you feel like you have had a full body workout and you will be warmed up and sweating.<br /><br />I found Level 2 to be the easiest of the three levels because it focuses on the plank pose and I found those moves to be more comfortable for me.  I find lunges to be the most difficult move for me to master.<br /><br />The 30 Days consist of 10 days of each level, but I worked Level 1 until I could complete the non-modified version of all moves without pausing.  I think it took me 14 days!  But it felt great to kick Level 1's butt.<br /><br />Great video...great workout....Highly recommended!!!
1455519006|3.0|Real satisfied with J. Archer's Clifton Chronicles.  Can not wait for third novel of series.  I have read a lot of D.Baldacci and liked The Innocent but I liked his previous novels more.
B00BWGL6BS|2.0|I always want to love whatever Dido does, for she has an amazing voice that's extremely unique and expressive.  For the most part, this album certainly isn't something that I dislike, but the safeness of it all definitely turns it into a mediocre listening experience.  While the vocals are pleasant--though nothing past that--the music that backs her up sounds like someone playing around on one of those Casio keyboards that I had a couple of decades ago, on which I'd hit a button and get a drum line, then hit another button and I'd get a bass line. . . .<br /><br />This album is, quite simply, safe.  Not once do I hear anyone here, vocalist or musician, challenging themselves to do something unique.  By the fourth song, my interest was completely gone, and there was nothing after that that brought my interest back.  I know that if I want to listen to Dido, I'm going to put on \\"Life for Rent,\\" because songs like \\"Happy New Year\\" (which is among the least-inspired songs musically that I've ever heard), \\"Love to Blame,\\" and \\"Day before We Went to War\\"--and virtually the entire album--sound heartless and soulless without significant music behind them to flesh out her vocals.<br /><br />In an interview, Dido said that there were never any moments when making the songs here was difficult.  I believe that completely because it's very obvious that there was almost no challenge here.  Safe, boring musical tracks backing safe vocal tracks doesn't add up to a work of art here--they add up to a collection of songs that will sell quite a few copies and make quite a bit of money for an established artist, but if this was the work of a new artist, Dido wouldn't be gaining a following with this uninspired fare.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|A while back a good friend introduced me to Nelson DeMille. I've enjoyed all of his books that I have read so far, some more than others as you would expect. The Panther is right up there with my favorites---great characters, good action and enough &#34;meat&#34; to make me think about the realities of today's world.
B0082SU98U|4.0|Pollyanna is a wholesome classic that should never go out of style. It's hard to find stories these days that aren't about drama or lust, and just provide a nice moral story that neither puts you to sleep nor makes you want to grind your teeth.
B004IFYMYI|5.0|I have no idea how much this item costs till I order it from Amazon ! Its a gift for Easter to my son in law
B00632HWOG|5.0|I have been with yahoo mail since 1998. It is my office away from my office, a life saver when I am away from my office.  Now with the ability to send large files, I rarely use my work email.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is my first Hugh Howey novel that I've read.  The story is extremely well written with great characters.  I was surprised early on that one of my favorite characters would soon come to an unfortunate end but it lead to a fantastic series of events that made it very hard to put the book down.<br /><br />I just downloaded the next omnibus, Shift and I can't wait to start reading.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book!
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I love James bond movies.  The last three that have hit the big screen have been absolutely knockouts.  Substituting the chase scenes with running chases rather than car chases has been more entertaining than ever before.  But that sure was a long movie, it could have ended on three different occasions during the film and I would have been okay with it.  Still loved it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show just gets better and better. It is so lovely to watch commercial free and back to back. This season is as good as the rest
B00APUQRPC|4.0|There was no trouble with the curve, Eastwood provides a Gran Torino performance, and its a &#34;daughter like father&#34; performance between the two.  However, the one hour and 52 minute film took me two and a half hours to view, due to the hickups with the film. It was worth the annoyance.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Simply riveting, it is terrific to watch the shows back to back. I recommend the entire season vs. one episode at a time!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Good read, nice coming of age story with a lot of twists along the way. Really feel like its written from a teenagers perspective.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Well done retro game.  I would have liked a real space invader level or two of side to side action,  but this is still a simply fun game
B004Y042N8|5.0|I really had a lot of fun playing GlowPuzzle, the first time, but it is not a game you want to play all the time.  I'll just put it away and play another time in the distant future.
B000KIPT30|5.0|I read the review before purchasing the amp. It seemed to be what I needed. It is perfect. It replaces a battery amp which had to be recharged and the batteries ware out after a year. This comes with  an ac adapter which can be used 24/7. 1/4 inch plugs do not come with the amp. You must buy them if you don't already have them.
B004LZFWJO|5.0|This is my idea of a game you can play everyday and never tire of it.  I'm not very good at it but I just keep trying to get to another level.  fun, fun, fun.
B009VB7QQA|1.0|What was I thinking?  I mean I should have known better.  But I thought that it would at least tongue-in-cheek...or something.  But no, it was just dumb.<br />I don't blame the producers for making this film...hey they were just trying to make a buck off me.  My bad for being the stupid one.
B009ME47H2|4.0|This app worked well for my need and it's quite simple to use. Overall I liked it a lot more than others that I tried.
B000IKQMFO|4.0|Wonderful murder mystery set in 1930's England.  You can already see in this early Robert Altman film his ability to run many threads of story lines and then tie them all up at the end.  Also a fun look at the English class system.<br />Though not quite as good as his later films I still recommend this film if you have any interests in murder mysteries, the peculiarities of the English or just want a good time watching a film.
B00999DFP0|5.0|This is my very favorite show!  Now I can watch it any time I want. It arrived right on time.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|This movie is definitely a great family movie!! I placed my order and received the movie in just a few days!!!  The case and movie were in excellent condition!!! I gave it a 5 star reading because overall everything was perfect!! Would definitely order from them again!! Thank you!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I absolutely love this game. It's so addictive an d challenging. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves a game that keeps your interest. Doesn't get boring
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Very well done. The finale was an inauthentic plot twist due to casting issues, but otherwise, so well-acted and directed.
B00BF123WG|5.0|this movie is so gripping especially in the beginning and end...must watch...very good if you like this kind of movie....watch it
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was as amazing book. I couldn't put it down! An awesome story. I really would recommend it!! :) get this book, you'll be glad you did.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I have read a lot of Grisham and he is a personal favorite.  This book was a disappointment.  It felt contrived and predictable.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|Excellent work and she's just 25.  Look forward to seeing this young artist mature, taking us with her on the journey.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Wow I don't think I have ever seen this many Elvis Hits on one CD for anywhere near this price. This was a no brainer.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Also loved this book, am not sure that a fourth would be as interesting as the three were! But I would probably read it!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app starts out very easy but then increases in difficulty as you move on. This game becomes addicting! I have this game on all of my devices...phone, iPad and kindle. I prefer the bigger devices, but can still easily play on my smaller phone.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It was a very good book, I could not put it down. I would recommend the series to all! Read it!
B0058YPILY|5.0|Criminal Minds is one of our favorite shows.  We will continue to purchase them as they become available.  We have all the seasons with the newest one on pre-order.
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|loved the movie but the end drug on a little bit.  However, we can understand the real life concept of the plot
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I downloaded this app for my phone to use when I am balancing my checkbook. It does the job and, and it is simple to use. I don't need anything fancy and this is it.
B007IUBU86|4.0|Really enjoyed the album.  I'm not much of a Dream Theater fan, so it was nice to hear Portnoy playing in a more straight-forward metal band.
B001LOPYHI|5.0|I have always loved this movie since the first time I saw it on the big screen. The graphics were state of the art in its time and I have been able to use it as a comparison for books on similar topics in the classroom.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Great story, great acting, great directing!  I thoroughly enjoyed it!  In a way it reminded me of Apollo 13, in that, you know the outcome, before you watch the movie.  But it's so well done, it keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B004P12SSW|5.0|I have always been a fan of Cher and Christine A.  The music and dancing were spectacular. I have watched it several times.
B00BGIC4I6|4.0|As a mid-forties married man with 2 pre-teen daughters, I'd thought I would love this film.  I didnt. I liked it, but it's not the best thing Judd Apatow has ever done.  It's too long and there is a LOT of arguing, which gets kind of annoying after awhile.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I suffer from insomnia, but with this app, nights are so much better. I listen to the rain and fall asleep right away. This app is also great for traveling, as it blocks out unfamiliar noises. I have used the app in the hospital and in a hotel, and I am very pleased with the product. With so many choices for white noice, you can't go wrong with this app. Highly recommend!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Great Book. Reminded me of how high school really was. I couldn't stop reading it.  You  become so close to the characters that you get lost in the book.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Thos show is very addicting. Each character is played so well. I like a good argument. Kalinda is my favorite character. She's so witty.
B00001W9G0|5.0|deffintely a chick flick but doesn't every one love one every now and then. have always been a fan of bab's she is always terrific. the movie is excellent everyone should own a copy to watch from time to time
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Love the calculator app on my Kindle Fire HD.  It has large numbers and is so easy to read and use.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book is a simple story but touched my heart.  I loved the central characters and moved into their situation with ease.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I  love I really enjoy reading  my Bible app on my Kindle Fire HD. It is so easy to read and I like reading the Bible.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Brave is a good animation but not a great one. A great animation consumes your attention to the point you forget you are watching an animation. Brave does not do that. It is good for younger viewers and enjoyable, however getting to view it was painful and frustrating. I was sent everywhere but to my video I wanted to watch. Why doesn't Prime have better access, perhaps an app just for the video that does not include a tour of the store. Prime video should be &#34;Prime Video.&#34;
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|I like this movie and would buy it again for gifts.  We saw this movie in the theatre, and wanted it for our film library.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This is a really good book. I can't wait for the next one. I would definitely recommend this to all my friends.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|When I got the product I was very surprised on how great the condition was.  Perfect packaging.  Would have swore it was brand new !
B0083WLKBA|5.0|Absolutely loved the stories of the family and staff of Downton Abbey and all the history from that period.  Well done.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|everyone should get this games. it's. so amazing and the graphics are sweet<br />I really hope that other games could be like this. and this should have a 5 star rating. plus its free
B009UX2YAC|5.0|.  You play and they give you a mission and you have to COMplete the mission  YOU SHOULD GET THIS GAME<br /> It gives you. Eggs it is so ready for Easter I love this GAME
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Is a great product.It fills my expectations at a low cost.Is easy to use and works very well at any conditions.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Nothing more said than I LOVE DEXTER! The series rates higher than a 5 that is for sure! I was in Fl; recently and I would have loved to have met Michael for real..he is such a good actor, and I love all the cast members! Great Job!!!
B00A757EFW|1.0|Very hard to motivate around the board.  It's pretty small & I think that's why it's so hard.  Not sure, just know it didn't suit me.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|I not only loved Dexter 4, I LOVED THEM ALL AND THEIR RATINGS are ALL 5, and if I could, I would give them all a 10.  I have watched the series from Season One, on up to six! Now I am patiently waiting, for Season 7.  Michael has captured many of my friends and sibling, that we buy seasons for each other and trade off the ones we have already watched, and turn someone else on to so that they too can see what I am talking about.  Michael makes the show so interesting and so OUTLANDISH, and still the reason for what he is doing is a true blessing to the society.  It's a series but a series you can't hate, or be sick or mad at, it makes you love the character all that much more, that you love to watch because it captures your whole inner self! Yes, it is just a TV series, but not too many can match the energy Michael and the cast members, gives out to their true fans! I LOVE DEXTER!!!!  &#60;3  Keep up the good work and the story lines are awesome!!! Thanks to all who have put their time and effort into this great series! I am a true fan of DEXTER!  Hope it never ceases!!!
B00969PR18|3.0|Not what I expected at all . . . . . . . .  . . . . . .
B005D9MUWY|5.0|very nice app. my first time used it was the free version and loved it. and I am really enjoy this version.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|it is nice so far, but it is very short for free. the paid version might be worth it, but I can't tell how much more i'd get for paying.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|The animated tiger was hard to distinguish from a live one.<br />Well done.  Good acting.  Also interesting about life in India.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Great action and plenty of bad guys. A Bond who was a little more sensitive than most. This one is highly recommended.
B00BESM14U|4.0|Great story, great acting, really all-around entertaining. The characters are three-dimensional and the story is nuanced. We really enjoyed this.
B002413TY2|5.0|Another action packed presentation. The Transporter series is always an edge of your seat movie. This one had a few more comedic lines than previous ones.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|you cant even search a video!!!!! I just want to watch some guitar tutorials! is that too much to ask!?!!?!
B005S9EKCW|1.0|My wife had been waiting and hoping that the BD of Les Miserables would arrive before before her birthday. It arrived the day before.<br /><br />I have to tell you, I was suspicious of the enterprise, but my wife was excited about it.<br /><br />So we retired to our theater last night. My wife reminded me it was not opera.<br /><br />From the very beginning this film is a truly excruciating experience and I was wishing it was an opera I was watching.<br /><br />Not one of the principals can hold a tune, or get on pitch let alone stay on it. Anne Hathaway can briefly get on pitch in the softer passages, but as soon as she tries to swell her voice she if off pitch by a mile.<br /><br />Even the chorus can not sing on pitch!<br /><br />The musical standard is well below any high school performance I have attended, or any production I have ever been involved with. The sort of sub amateur performance on this disc I tried to listen to last night would not have seen the light of day and this production should not have either.<br /><br />About a third of the way through, as I was holding my piece, my wife said, \\" I just can't watch this any more.\\"<br /><br />I said \\"every nerve I own is just raw\\". So off it went never to disgrace this theater again.<br /><br />This is a pity. I like Les Miserable. I have seen it on Broadway.<br /><br />This movie requires singing actors, and not famous actors who can't sing. This is what opera signers are. They can sing and in terms of acting are the equal of any cast members here. We now have an abundance of fine singing actors. I would have cast Barbara Hannigan soprano, in place of Anne Hathaway for a start.<br /><br />This production is a total disgrace and my advice is to pass up this disc, it is a total waste of money, in fact worse as you will be quickly climbing the walls if you try to watch it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is really cool! You get to play and wash your gourde. Enter into competitions and a bunch more. And the thing I really like about it is that its not constantly pushing you to buy stuff!
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Not expecting much when I saw this, but I was pleasantly surprised. The voices were great, although I think the mom has a serious disco problem. Danny DeVito was perfect as the tough-love Lorax, and the sparring between him and the Oncelor (the originator of the problem) were funny. Songs were an added way to get through a lot of the original story quickly, without losing the impact.<br />I think the animals stole the show, for the little screen time they had, and some of the most memorable lines from the book were in the right place at the right time.<br /><br />Different from the book in many ways, but both with the same message.
B002M9WW30|4.0|I bought this a few months back for my husbands birthday! Success! He loves it!<br /><br />Great as a gift for any man!
B000O77SRC|5.0|This is, by far, the best of the Die Hard movies. I bought this movie and a video game for my Grandson's birthday. He loved both of the items. Would recommend this movie as a &#34;must have&#34; for collectors of classic movies!
B005K17RU0|5.0|AccuWeather gives you all the pertinent facts - clean and neat.  Excellent source for hourly and weekly forecasts.  Their layout is crisp and user-friendly.
1594203334|5.0|I really liked this book. The author does a great job of offering insightful anectodes on the differences in American versus Parisan parenting. I can't wait to read Bebe Day by Day, the next book. A lot of the strategies she talks about have really stuck with me and I find myself incorporating them into my daily habits without really thinking about it. They are just common sense things you don't really think of, but once you know, you don't forget..I would definitely recommend for any parent who can see that American children are not as well behaved as their counterparts from other countries.
B00BDZV9M4|5.0|I don't get these bad reviews. If you don't like Lil Wayne why the heck would you buy his cd? You obviously know what he is by now and the type of music he puts out. If you LIKE Wayne you will like this cd. If you don't like Wayne, don't listen to him!<br />I loved his last cd, and this cd is even better. Great beats and great lyrics like always.<br />1.ianahb-6/10<br />2.curtains-8/10<br />3.days and days-7/10<br />4.gunwalk-9/10<br />5.no worries-10/10<br />6.back to you-9/10<br />7.tigger finger-7/10<br />8.beat that s***-7/10<br />9.rich as f***-7/10<br />10.trippy-8/10<br />11.love me-10/10<br />12.romance-8/10<br />13.god bless amerika-10/10<br />14.wowzerz-6/10<br />Overall it's a great cd.

B002QE3CTY|5.0|This story was on a school reading list for my daughter. She loved it and thought I would too!  Great story, you feel caught up in the story of these boys! I need to read the rest of the trilogy.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I loved this book and am going to get the next! I loved the Gore but also the sad and exciting parts.
B008476HBM|5.0|So Darcy was proud and Elizabeth was prejudiced... Or Elizabeth was proud and Darcy was prejudiced? Or everyone was a little proud and a little prejudiced.<br /><br />Guys, don't read this book if you're just trying to make yourself more attractive to the ladies. Read it because it's worth reading. Who knows... You might learn something!<br /><br />Anyway, Elizabeth Bennett is one of the most memorable characters of English literature. Austen's &#34;play-by-play&#34; description of conversations saves time but after a while gets a little boring. Power through those sections and appreciate the way she paints characters, even minor ones. You will not regret reading this book while you are still young and can learn something from it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is really well done. Use it a lot with clients and other misc things. wish it had some additional functions, but not a big deal.
B0095P31L6|4.0|It was a cute movie with a good moral.  We laughed a lot at all the different movie quotes within this movie.
1609611543|5.0|My wife lived for 7 years as a celiac (no wheat or gluten at all) and I thought I already knew everything about wheat.  Turns out I hadn't even scratched the surface.  This is a good book.  I'm really glad I read it.

1400069807|5.0|I recently lost over 100 lbs.  I am learning how to eat healthy.  I can't believe all the science that goes into our junk food!  It really is addicting and here is the proof!
B000002KYK|5.0|While Vangelis was relying almost exclusively on synthesizers and other electronic instruments, the new American Orchestra does it the old fashion way - the score was written for a jazz orchestra. Any attempts to compare the original soundtrack and orchestral rendition will do disservice to both, although I will always favor the orchestral arrangement. Some of the jazz licks that Vangelis incorporated into his music were often overshadowed by electronic effects. Here, through superb arrangements, they were nicely exploited using standard orchestral instruments.  The real show stopper is \\"Blade Runner Blues\\" with a haunting trumpet solo. The synth technology has immensely advanced since 1982. Perhaps Vangelis could make some extra cash by re-arranging his music using cutting edge electronic instruments.
B000ZM1FXO|3.0|It was a good story about the craziest roman emperor ever.  It gave a good insight into how depraved and sadistic the man really was.  Not as good as the Peter O'Tool version, but a good watch non the less.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|Couldn't wait to see it! All that I expected. The transformations were unbelievable. Much better watching at home vs theater
B009KEN87O|5.0|Retro gaming done right. This baby has all the bells and whistles. It's a combo of asteroids, space invaders, galaga and a few other games. How can you go wrong.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is amazing it's very addictive but I love it and I'm sure whoever is<br />Reading this will love it too !!!.best game ever x
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this e-book.  Blake Crouch has one hell of an imagination, and uses it to the fullest extent with PINES.  The writing is superb - great character development and scene setting.<br /><br />This story kept me intrigued and interested from the start.  I loved how all the pieces came together at the end with the revelation that I truly did not see coming.  This book is action packed, with suspense that will keep you turning pages (or swiping them) for hours at a time.  I read to be entertained, and am able to suspend my disbelief and go along for the ride for a story - most of the one and two star reviewers are not, needing the science and the protagonist's actions and abilities to be 100% realistic.  This is fiction people...lighten up and enjoy a good story!<br /><br />And a good story this is.  I love multi-genre books, and Blake delivers a great mix with this one.  I love watching an author's writing get better and better with each book, and I was skeptical he'd be able to do better than RUN.  But he did, as I enjoyed PINES even more.<br /><br />The ending of this book does not beg for a sequel by any means, but there is one coming which I am THRILLED about.  I can't wait to see where the author takes this story next - WAYWARD is coming out in October of 2013 with at least one more book in the series planned after that (according to the author on FB).  Also...Fox is developing a TV series based on PINES with M. Night Shyamalan executive producing.  Sweet!
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|This game is really good but can you at least please upgrade it so you can play longer and have more missions an ad zombie mode
B003V1WTMM|4.0|This is another masterful gothic novel by Kate Morton.  It contains a web of mysteries, that weave through two world wars, and come together on a stormy night.  It engages the reader in the beginning, and continues to keep the reader intrigued ,and turning pages. It will cause sleepless nights, and devotion until the very end.  That is the definition of a very good story.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could not put the book down for one minute! Such unpredictable twists at every flip of the page. A MUST READ for sure!
0670026638|5.0|This is one of the most touching and enjoyable novels I've read in a long time. You really come to care about the characters, especially the young girl. And there are some great insights to Zen practice and life in general tucked in there throughout the book. Good books are enjoyable; the great books change the way you see yourself and the world. This might be a great book -- time will tell.
B0089XWU6W|3.0|I enjoyed this very much more than I expected to. Although I've seen many of his movies, and although I share his great love of New York City, I've never been an Allen fan (I'm not a whole lot younger than he is, so I've known of him in his various careers almost from the beginning), and I've actively despised him since he did what he did to Mia Farrow and her children.<br /><br />I still don't think he's the moviemaking genius his fans see and this production promotes, and it really does make out like his abominable conduct 20 years ago was just media hysteria, which is appalling. But this is a fascinating and almost always entertaining production, and the 3+ hours flew by.<br /><br />The few sections that were nearly unbearable did not involve Allen himself but two of the other talking heads who sing his praises (Allen himself comes across as relatively humble, which may or may not be genuine): One is the famous movie critic Richard Schickel, who appears periodically throughout both parts; his worship of Allen is so creepy that it seriously undermines not only his credibility as a critic but any pretense of objectivity this production has. The second is an extremely smug and obnoxious woman named Annette Insdorf, who is identified as a Film Professor at Columbia University; but (Thank God) she makes only one appearance in each part, and only for a few minutes at the beginning. She's more obnoxious than Schickel but less creepy.<br /><br />Allen fans don't have to be encouraged to watch this paean to and whitewashing of their hero; but even some, like me, who are not fans at all may be entertained.
B00AZNEW5G|4.0|Kathryn Bigelow is one of the best directors in the movie industry today!  Her sensitivity and eye for dramatic flair is a lifetime of patient watching and learning what makes people tick.  She translates the written word to video media with aplumb.  Character development is here strong point and an understanding of what is great cinema reminds me of the great Alfred Hitchcock.  I enjoyed this movie emotionally, physically and in a way that shows goods triumph over evil.  You have to see it to believe it.  You will enjoy this feature from beginning to end.
B0064NTZKI|3.0|I enjoyed this very much more than I expected to. Although I've seen many of his movies, and although I share his great love of New York City, I've never been an Allen fan (I'm not a whole lot younger than he is, so I've known of him in his various careers almost from the beginning), and I've actively despised him since he did what he did to Mia Farrow and her children.<br /><br />I still don't think he's the moviemaking genius his fans see and this production promotes, and it really does make out like his abominable conduct 20 years ago was just media hysteria, which is appalling. But this is a fascinating and almost always entertaining production, and the 3+ hours flew by.<br /><br />The few parts that were nearly unbearable did not involve Allen himself but two of the other talking heads who sing his praises (Allen himself comes across as relatively humble, which may or may not be genuine): One is the famous movie critic Richard Schickel, who appears periodically throughout both episodes; his worship of Allen is so creepy that it seriously undermines not only his credibility as a critic but any pretense of objectivity this production has. The second is an extremely smug and obnoxious woman named Annette Insdorf, who is identified as a Film Professor at Columbia University; but (Thank God) she makes only one appearance in each episode, and only for a few minutes at the beginning. She's more obnoxious than Schickel but less creepy.<br /><br />Allen fans don't have to be encouraged to watch this paean to and whitewashing of their hero; but even some, like me, who are not fans at all may be entertained.
B002HML6Y8|4.0|This is tounge in cheek but I like it for the action and the silly little things and Kate is of course always fine to watch.  Dracula was over the top, his brides delicious and the Van H., character himself outstanding.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books are a MUST READ!!!  This all could happen to us.  Suzanne Collins has nailed it!!!!  I could not put this Trilogy down.  The first movie is great and I'm waiting patiently for number 2.
B000ICLRIE|4.0|I have this one on DVD but the Blu-ray version has the little scens that fit everything all together.  This was as exciting for me as the first time I watched it.  Good story, characters are right on and the message is clear.  Don't hesitate to grab this on Blu-ray before it's gone.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|I loved this book series and Hell's Corner didn't disappoint.  I read them out of order for some reason - I wouldn't recommend that. David Baldacci is a great writer and always keeps my attention while reading.  There are 5 books in The Camel Club series (so far) Read them ALL.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|It was delightful and I am looking forward to sequel though that was not advertised.  I am assuming that this will be forthcoming.
B007REV4YI|4.0|Confession: I have only seen the Daniel Craig James Bond movies.  I like them, and I keep intending to watch the other Bonds, I just never have.  I feel guilty for missing out on the history when I watch them.<br /><br />Skyfall definitely has old-fashioned pacing.  After the dynamic train sequence at the beginning of the film, it's a slow burn to the explosive finale.  Oh, there are some little action sequences here and there, but director Sam Mendes keeps it simple until its time to break lose and let Bond, Silva (Javier Bardem), and M (Judi Dench) have it out.<br /><br />I am enamored of the lighting and color in Skyfall.  There are several terrific uses of silhouette, but none better than when Bond grapples with a hitman in a skyscraper with an open window.  It's blue and beautiful and has lingered in my mind.  So many action films are utterly forgettable and interchangeable, so I'd love Skyfall for that sequence alone.<br /><br />But Skyfall isn't overly arty.  It delivers everything a Bond film promises, what everyone expects whether they've seen a Bond movie before or not.  Chases, a cool car, beautiful women, inventive attempts at murder.  It's frequently funny, even the ruthless M providing plenty of humor.  There is some musing over whether the ends justify the means, but the heroes of the movie are still unquestionably the heroes.<br /><br />Some elements of the story are weak.  One part of Silva's plan relies on Q, the genius of M1-6, to do something rather dumb.  Of course he does it.  But the characters aren't repeatedly stupid, so I can forgive a few missteps made for the sake of pushing the plot forward.<br /><br />I really should watch the other Bond films, given how much I've enjoyed Craig's outings as the famous spy.  And I'll definitely keep watching his tenure, and probably that of his successor.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|A book worth reading. Superb author who makes you remember what is important in our journey of life!  Couldn't put it down!
B0064Z7RXS|5.0|This music was before its time. Good stuff, everyone likes pumpkins. Eveyone thought billy would be long gone. Look @ them now putting out a new cd. Will they be the stones of our generation ?
B0058VW36U|5.0|My grandson says this is the best ever.  I had to purchase Cut the Rope Experiments for him.  He plays them all the time.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|An engaging show that sucks you in and makes you look more closely at the world around you. You can't help but cheer for this odd duo.
B005PZ85SO|5.0|I have seen every episode of this show and always love it. Can't wait to find out if Giddion is the killer or not.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|Every child needs to be cared for in a loving manner and this book explains where the breakdown occurs in a family which ultimately leads to life success or not. The book shows that everyone could benefit from the research on how a child succeeds, rich or poor. I wish schools would teach more than academics because it does take more than knowledge to get ahead. Also there are better spots to intervene as the book explains , than we currently do to achieve a better chance at closing the success gap for children in poverty.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I absolutely love this show. My favorite. And this episode will leave you stunned at the end. Can't wait for next season already.
B004HEXSLI|4.0|Having had a stroke 5 years ago, I found the book VERY INSIGHTFUL. If you have an average imagination, this book will connect the dots of what it's like to experience a stroke, as well as the rehab phase.
B008J05EL8|3.0|I am not completely familiar with it's function yet. Still working on it therefore, I can't give a fair rating yet
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is fun, and keeps you entertained very easily! :) Good for young children, teenagers, or even super awesome bronies. Very fun!
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|Not completely familiar yet, still working on it but, I think I like it. I need more time before rating.
B000NY12LO|5.0|I really liked this book. Made you think about many different perspectives. Worth reading for sure. I would reccommend it.
B007N6NGYG|4.0|I enjoy playing it, but some levels are better suited for a 10 inch screen, on my Nexus 7 the screen can get too busy and cramped making it hard to play.
B007REV4YI|5.0|It took us a few viewings to decide that we really love it, but it's on the shelf with our favorites.  My husband knows every line to every Bond movie ever made, and we both agree that Daniel Craig is the best Bond yet.
B009POCG2C|5.0|Another great Eastwood movie. Very intertaining from start to ending. Supporting cast also did excellent work as well. The story is very believeable if you are a baseball fan!
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Music the whole family can love.  We really enjoy the music as well as the singing...it's music we can all agree on.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved mockingjay and I am very sad that it is over!!! I loved when Katniss sang \\"The Hanging Tree\\" and \\"Deep In The Meadow\\"
B000WYCF6Q|5.0|I do a fair amount of dual sport riding that is mostly off road and closer to single track style riding. I was looking for an option to have an under the handlebar mount that was relatively protected and give me just enough visibility on the streets to see what was next to me and behind me before I did a head check.<br /><br />At ~ $15.00 each, I decided to try the Zefal Spy Bicycle Mirrors since the were much cheaper than anything I could find and seemed to provide a number of mounting positions. The mounting is easy and with some fiddling on the road I actually got them in a very comfortable position. Because they are more oval shaped, the visibility was better than I expected. Hit the trails for about 4 hours and never had an issue with them falling off or getting out of whack. In fact, I didn't adjust them on the way home, they were still pointed where I wanted to see. Long term I would like to figure out a better method for mounting them to the handlebars. I foresee the rubber getting brittle over time and breaking.<br /><br />Bang for buck, I think they are a nice option.
B00338QENI|4.0|This is another book which is difficult to follow as the reader is left at one door and then picked up at another with confusion as to where the history is now and what path and which person we are following. However, I have recommended it to my friends who are ready to tackle a difficult subject but one that is truly fascinating. The subject is so very important to science and also to law and where our own privacy is concerned- which comes first- us or the chase of finding the cause and cure of cancer.
B00BF11STU|1.0|This was a very slow moving movie,  the plot line was ok but nothing to write home about.  Was very disappointed over with the actors, filming and director.  This could have been a much better movie if only thought out more to keep a VET interested and a non VET on the edge of their seat wondering what was going to happen next.
B003UYUP58|5.0|i LOVE TO LEARN AS WELL AS BEING ENTERTAINED. THIS BOOK WAS WELL WRITTEN, ALTHOUGH IF i PUT IT DOWN I HAD TO READ SOME TO FIND MY WAY BACK, BUT THAT WAS TH FAULT OF THE CANCER HISTORY MORE THAN THE BOOK'S FAILINGS. IT WAS NOT A BOOK I WOULD  RECOMMEND TO THOSE NOT INTERESTED IN EXPLORING A SUBJECT SO IMPORTANT TO US ALL. HOWEVER, i FOUND IT FASCINATING.
0385349947|2.0|This is because, on its own, the book is not good enough to merit all the publicity it has received.  Sandberg is right about some things.  We have to have the attitude that men and women are equal in the workplace.  Once we adopt the attitude that women are different (\\"too intuitive,\\" \\"too emotional\\") we will cease making any significant progress on achieving some or any form of equality.  Larry Summers's epidode at Harvard teaches us that.<br />  Absolute equality need not be the goal, as Sandberg implies.  In my book (Branson, \\"The Last Male Bastion: Gender and the CEO Suite\\" (2010)) I examine the careers of the 22 women who actually had made it to the CEO suite.  These women compartmentalized their lives rather than abandoning any significant part of it, as Sandberg contends they should do.  For instance, 21 of the 22 women have children, 47 in all.  At some point in their career, many of them also sat down with their spouses, reaching agreements over whose career had the most promise and therefore should take precedence. But in no instance were roles completely reversed, as Sandberg urges should be the case.<br />  Sandberg also intiates that no progress has been made.  She is wrong about this as well.  Jill Barad (Mattel Toy) was the first female CEO in the modern Fortunre 500, in 1997.  As late as 2002, there still were only two.  Today there are 21 female CEOs of large corporations so an advancement have been made, albeit not a huge one.<br />  Sandberg also is a bit of a hypocrite.  She went to Harvard.  She had very supportive parents.  When her husband became CEO of high tech company in Seattle, he simply moved it to the Silicon Valley to ease child care and other predicaments two career families encounter.  That simply is not an available alternative to most of us.<br />  I also lament that anecdotal accounts like Sandberg's rather than empirical examinations on what women who reach the top actually did rule the roost.  My other book, Branson, \\"No Seat at the Table: How Governance and Law Keep Women Out of the Boardroom.\\" contains several analyses of how women who reach corporate boards actually got there.

B00BHMF578|3.0|I had high expectations for ARGO but quite honestly found it kind of simple and felt it lacked character development.
0800141660|3.0|It's a classic tale remade with some actors. My wife loves it though. I remember the remake in the Daria episode, but that's about it.
B008Q00I9O|5.0|This movie could be viewed as very offensive, but it's so over the top ridiculous! My bf watched it for the first time and laughed so hard! :)
B00003CWL6|5.0|This has been a great job about the &#34;typical American family&#34; and how appearance dominates everything. Funny, serious, realistic and intriguing. Kevin Spacey is excellent, everyone else is as well.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|I loved this Tarantino movie! It took a lot of heart to take on the subject of slavery...I loved Leonardo's performance as the ruthless slave-owner.
B0007TKNII|4.0|It's a good movie if you seen the original and can't afford to go once a month to the Broadway Show. The music was adapted and the visuals give you more than you will see on stage.
B005C8ENI0|5.0|Held our attention.  We've watched it twice and will probably watch it again.  Hard to find that kind of movie.  Check it out.
B000FVQLRA|5.0|The story about a polish-jewish pianist during world war 2. This shows you that music (and a serious hiebe of luck) can overcome the greatest evil in the world. It is graphic, yet should be shown to any teenager (with supervision) to remind them that there where some tragic, yet very emotional stories in the past.
1419704400|5.0|Content is wonderful! It is on the coffee table. I looked through it very slowly and got great pleasure from that. To be really honest about the purchase. If Rooney Mara was not on the cover, I doubt I would have bought this, although it's content is wonderful entertainment for us who love visual smorgasbord such as this. Rooney is such a chameleon. Look for her to soar.
B000OVLBGC|3.0|This story is about the spy techniques that have been performed during East Germany, before the fall of the Berlin Wall. A Surveilancer ensuring that the Artist and his significant other are not betraying the Communist Society, he becomes a part of them without their knowledge. Thought-Provoking and intriguing.
B00006D295|5.0|this is a good item, i gave it 5 starts, it works well, i would buy this again as needed
6304806418|4.0|A nice film-adaptation and Biography of Evita Peron. this is not a movie. It is a film-turned musical. Madonna did a good job, so did Antonio Banderas. I just didn't get why the Argentinians protested when the movie came out.
B00BWC1UZE|5.0|This is by far one of best albums I've listened to in a while. You can'y go wrong with this one... if you put it on shuffle or play it as is you still get that sense of comfort when listening to this disk.<br /><br />I would suggest that you go to target and get the Target exclusive - I got mine for $10 on salee... but seriously this is surely worth every penny and effort to go pick up!
078401213X|5.0|This is an indie-movie and it shows. Not in a bad way. One thing first: it is in black and white. It is very unsettling, the way it was filmed (fast-flashy-imagry, turning you restless).<br />The story about a math-genius figuring out the number that decodes the entirety meaning of the world. It is not 42. A number so powerful it will drive you insane (not 23). This movie will make you think. A classic for unconventional cinema!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|A get 'er done app. Does what it's supposed to with a simple and effective interface. Oh, did I mention it's free!

B00008WJBU|4.0|The story about luck and it's value. Gambling with people's lifes. The story is in spanish, if you don't understand it, get ready to read the subs. Yet, the movie is thought provoking and quite graphic.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Really enjoying the puzzles as well as the storyline.  I am having a hard time putting it down.  Much much more than just a hidden picture game.

B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Movie trailers are so misleading.  This appeared to be much funnier in previews.  As a middle age woman, struggling with the realities of life, I found it to be a little too realistic. lol!!!!  Great acting and really, I suppose, good writing.  Just not my cup of tea.  Wouldn't really recommend for anyone much under age of 50. lol
B0085KGGHI|5.0|If you've read Keith's &#34;Life&#34; (or know much at all about the Stones) you can easily imagine what a blast this little jam was for them. Sound is excellent as is picture quality, especially given the nature of the venue. It's especially nice to see Ian Stewart up close and having a great time with Muddy's band. As for the rest,  Mick's in fine form, but seems a bit over-awed by Muddy and his pals, Keith is laid back and careful not to overstep, and Ronnie Wood is, as always, just about perfect.
B007QDNKQA|5.0|Great movie, believable, good pace.....what is there not to like about it.  I would strongly recommend for fans of this genre.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|nd the movie was terrific.  So much better getting the extra levels of the character's thoughts.  Even when you figure out what is going on, it doesn't 't spoil it.  A great book!!!
B001OQCV6A|2.0|Didn't like the depictions of characters, inclusion of unnecessary sex. I am sorry that i purchased this because i like Sherlock Holmes.  Modern adaptations always are below the original classics.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's very addicting I love this game. It's a great time passer. And fun to take turns playing to see who can go the most meters.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|If you would really like to love and hate and evolve and feel with  a character this is a really good book to exercise your right to do that.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Seen through the eyes of a child and narrated by Death, the story of the German people who suffered inside Germany becomes very real.  This novel can make one laugh, cry and ache for the Germans who lived in abject poverty and fear during Hitler's reign of harsh realities.  There is such beauty in the characters we learn to know.  Of course, there is such ugliness in people as well.  This novel offers a different perspective, life for the German people, than we normally come to expect.  The Holocaust is never far away from the reader's thoughts, however, as one child reminds us.  Dachau is the ever present reminder for her and us.<br />Carole

B00BWJARHO|5.0|I was expecting so much, and I wasn't disappointed.  The visuals are so much more vibrant and alive than the previous movies.
B004P8A7J2|3.0|The acting was good but the story line is a complete bummer.  There is nothing uplifting or hopeful to be found.  Fairly likable characters each going down the tubes in mental illness and/or drug addition.<br /><br />I would not recommend it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I'm recommending this book to all Grisham fans and to all you who have not yet discovered him.  I love his writing style and his stories.  I've read all of his books from cover to cover.  You will not be disappointed by The Racketeer.

B00BSBU4EC|5.0|We loved this movie! Age ranges from 35 down to 5 with 10 and 8 in between. We saw it in the theatre first and then got it through Amazon Prime for my 10 yr old's sleepover birthday party. Pitch is scary but not too scary. It was fun to remember the childhood heros and could be a great spring board for discussion about purpose and identity with the family.

B0095ZMMCK|3.0|Clancy has really phoned it in with his last few books, but this is finally a step in the right direction.  This isn't up to his best work, which in my opinion was Without Remorse, but it's pretty good and will keep your interest.  I'm not a huge fan of the co-writing thing, as it really dilutes his message as a storyteller, but this was well done and I believe he was more involved in the writing of this book than in previous ones.  Not worth paying top dollar for a hard copy, but the Kindle edition was a decent value.
B00B8SSWSK|4.0|As Depeche More are ageing, their focus is shifting, opening up new avenues soundwise. More raw and visceral than ever before, &#34;Delta machine&#34; maintains the classic DM element while also boasting a more mature overall sound, with strikingly minimal, warmer electronic elements, evoking moody techno more than the bouncy synth-pop most would expect from them. The thematology of sex, faith, religion, and death, comes as no exception again, but this time there is a strident bluesy feel running through the album, echoing the electro-blues of &#34;Personal Jesus&#34; from their 1990 &#34;Violator&#34; seminal album. While last album, &#34;Sounds of the universe&#34;, proved a traditional DM affair sonically, &#34;Machine&#34; is clearly more energetic and bold, aiming to excite rather than just please. Amid trembling beats, pulsating bass, choral harmonies and soaring strings, this is an impressive set. &#34;Secret to the end&#34; and &#34;Broken&#34; are deliriously infectious, &#34;Soft touch/Raw nerve&#34; is a delicious throwback to the band's more pop-oriented material, &#34;My little universe&#34; is pure minimalistic brilliance, while &#34;Should be higher&#34; is a true DM delight. &#34;Delta machine&#34; is an exciting and accomplished record. Simultaneously feeding from their back catalogue, and pushing the band furthermore, it is a creative piece of work that sits comfortably alongside DM's finest moments. A truly great band, &#34;Depeche&#34; cannot be more ironic a name for them, really. In a time where pretty much everything is &#34;depeche&#34;, they most certainly are not.
B00BESIKWM|3.0|This movie was.... interesting? Not a very good plot or series of events, but it was entertaining to say the least. On the plus side it has Kit Harington as one of the lead rolls and I'm quite ok with that. I'm also a huge Sean Bean fan so I suffered through it just to see what happened to these two guys! Not worth the online rental price, go to your local movie rental place and get it for 99 cents if you want to watch it.
0061148512|5.0|I would recommend this book to collectors because the pages and cover are pretty. It would look good in anyone's collection. The story itself is very depressing. So be prepared to be sad when you read it.
B00AOMR2S2|4.0|My daughter got my family hooked on this movie. The soundtrack has those fun a capella numbers, but only the trebles and bellas numbers were full length. The rest were slightly longer than what was featured in the movie. I would have loved a longer version of the sockapellas and footnotes numbers. Overall, a good purchase but know that the songs aren't much more than a minute or so long.
0143039431|5.0|A really quality book, an overall good read I recommend it to everyone.  Book's physical quality was good as well, no big deficiencies.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I enjoyed the original version of this game so much that I purchased this one.  Have gone through and finished all the puzzles more than once.  Towards the end the the puzzles get really interesting.  It is a great brain workout.
B00003CY5J|5.0|I really enjoy this movie and highly recommend it.  The DVD itself was of good quality, have no complaints here.
B00B9LNJ9I|5.0|I have been a fan of Dido ever since \\"Thank You\\" back in 2000. Her last album \\"Safe Trip Home\\" was good but its songs did not have lasting impact as they all seemed to be slow placed and moody. No suprise, as Dido was dealing with the death of her beloved father and the break up of a long-term relationship...<br /><br />Now Dido is in a much better place, happily married with a child and the songs on \\"the Girl Who Got Away\\" are some of the best she has ever written & created. I've been listening to the extended 2 disc version for over two weeks now (it was released in England earlier this month) and can honestly say its as good as her debut \\"No Angel.\\"<br /><br />Here you find radio and club friendly tracks like \\"Let Us Move On\\", \\"\\"Blackbird\\", \\"The End of Night\\", and \\"Let's Runaway\\"<br />among others whose chorus will stick in your memory long after the tracks are over. There is something for everyone and I expect both old and new fans will support this new release.<br /><br />\\"No Freedom\\" is a good track but a poor choice as a first single as many music critics cited this as an example of how Dido is playing it safe and how all her songs sound the same. It could have been released on any of her previous two cds. Fear not, as this is perhaps one of her 'weakest' tracks on the album and is not a good indicator of what lies ahead..

B0090CMMIC|5.0|I decided to download this album because it was on sale and because I liked the track called &#34;Bones&#34; which had been played on my local Active Rock station a few times. I was honestly a bit skeptical prior to listening, given the sameness of many bands in this genre, but I've been listening to this album constantly over the past couple of days and I love it! There are more melodies and hooks in most of the songs on this album than with most other newer hard rock groups--instead of trying to slam a big wall of dirty-sounding guitars in the listener's face (which is what many bands are trying to do these days, it seems), the band focuses on sounding streamlined and clean while still staying very heavy (with lots of drums and chugging guitar riffs everywhere).<br /><br />There are lots of heavy tracks to pump your fists to, like &#34;Dearly Departed&#34;, &#34;Brother in Arms&#34; and &#34;Learn My Lesson&#34;. The album features a few power ballads as well, like &#34;You Are Not&#34; and &#34;Everything Ends&#34;. All in all, a very good listen and something refreshing from the hard rock genre.

B00BN2CY7G|4.0|I have been a Bon Jovi fan for a long time and have always been excited whenever a new album would come out. Though there are a few songs that I'm not particularly fond of, I love the sound and feel of the songs. I also think that Jon sounds fantastic, and his vocals seem to be just the right fit for this album. Can't wait to see them live again!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|My new favorite author. I'll do anything to get my hands on his next book.  Can I offer my services as a proof reader? I am a long time science fiction fan and this book kept me up at night as I did not want to put it down. From the story line to the characters, an action packed yet deep thinking powerhouse.
B00514HDNW|4.0|I saw the movie \\"Omega Man\\" (based loosely on this book, \\"I Am Legend\\") in the 70's and, a couple years ago, the saw movie \\"I Am Legend\\" starring Will Smith.  I enjoyed both movies -- and now I have enjoyed the classic that inspired them as well.  The movies and the book are somewhat similar to each other (and somewhat different as well).  But if you enjoyed either of the movies, you should enjoy this book as well.  A key aspect of both movie and book is the psychological impact of sustained personal isolation (i.e., the lone survivor is not chased by zombies/vampires every night).
B0089EHWQE|5.0|One of the absolute best books I have ever read and I read a lot! A wonderful and absolutely touching love story. Read it.

0393927938|5.0|This second edition has value to the growing importance of Mary Shelley to the fields of feminist study, cultural communication, and literature. In addition to the original novel and critical essays, the editor has added recent material expanding upon present day examinations.  While it is by no means the only book one needs for an adequate to understanding of this very young, and very talented woman, her life and background, it is the definitive text for the study of changes in critical commentary.<br />As a textbook for an undergraduate course, or a graduate level seminar, it is complete yet discussion provoking. As research material for writers and critics it gives an invaluable wealth of commentary.<br />It also happens to be an exception to the rule of college bookstores in two ways: the book is easily affordable and of value in inverse proportion to its cost.<br />Mark Arnold, Ph.D.  Communication Studies
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Surprisingly it is one of the most entertaining movies I've seen over the last year.  In my opinion this movie has something to offer for all age groups, the music is good, acting appear carefree a natural.  I highly recommend you watch this movie if your looking for a entertaining time.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Granted it is not as shock and awe as the first book, but picks up where the first left off.

B000FBFN1U|5.0|Lots of shocking turns and twists in this one. Granted my favorite character doesn't make it, the story still made me want to read more and more. Probably is almost as good as the first but better then the second.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|What an amazing book. I couldn't put the book down. I cant wait to read more books from Nicholas Sparks. I Can't wait to see the movie now!!!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Once everything starts going, the story gets better and better. It becomes harder and harder to put the book down.
0060581808|4.0|Little House in the Big Woods is a story of a family living in the woods of Wisconsin in the 1800s. Family and survival were very important! Laura's family had to take care of themselves.  They made their own food, clothes, tools, and nearly everything else that they needed.  They also had a loving family that loved to work and play hard together.<br /><br />We gave the book four stars because we felt that Laura Ingalls Wilder did an extraordinary job of showing what life was like in the wilderness in the 1800s. We think this book is a good story for all ages.  We do think you should probably be in fourth or fifth grade before you try and read it yourself. We recommend that you buy this book today!<br /><br />-Mr. S's Second Grade Class
B00873GRU4|3.0|quite a different sort of end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it story. I am left with many questions and I am looking forward to the next one

B006MPKAOI|4.0|Hard to pit down! Even though a bit confusing in places the journey to the climax was a roller coaster - something in here for everyone to identify with. Another story set in London (at least partly)- I love them

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I like everything about Walking Dead.It has a great story line.The cast are purfect for the parts.Need more shows like this!!!
0316232955|5.0|I must admit I had never read a book that was first a movie, but while I was expecting my package I decided to watch the movie to catch a glimpse of what I was about to read, and believe me I'm glad I did because this book is way better than the movie, let me clarify that this is a diary not a third person novel, it describes the facts at the end of many days after they happened not during.<br /><br />This is definetely one of the best books I've read, even though Colfer is just starting as a writer (SBL being his second novel), it is great, personally I am highly related with &#34;Carson Phillips&#34; (this book's main character), but besides the connection I made with the book I strongly recommend it because it has a great story and it also teaches many things about life, high school, people, etc...<br /><br />If you are a teen looking for a good story or a parent looking for some enjoyable reading that also leaves something on your mind to think about and later apply to life, this is the book for it.<br /><br />It came very well packaged in a very secure cardboard box basically made for the book and it arrived way before expected so amazon and Chris Colfer both made their part which satisfied me 100% Don't think twice and buy it!!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|Can I just say this:  WOW Jillian!  This is an amazing workout, especially when you consider that it is only 20 minutes.<br /><br />Here's the thing - I am a habitual quitter in my workout and diet routines.  I started a very doable diet about 6 weeks ago and have actually stuck with it, but hit the plateau at 11 lbs.  I decided it was time to commit to working out, too, but I can't stand gyms.  All those skinny people just don't motivate me!<br /><br />And then I found Jillian.  I should tell you that I have done level one of this DVD exactly twice.  Day one was when it was delivered.  I was SO excited.  I shut the door so hubby couldn't watch me bouncing around like a crazy person with breathing problems and popped that DVD in.  10 minutes in, and you are feeling the burn, my friend.  For someone not in shape at all, minutes 16 - 20 are PURE TORTURE.  I was so proud when I actually finished it.<br /><br />Now, halfway through, Jillian mentions something about cutting out hours at the gym.  Pure talk, right?  Oh, no!  It is not!  The next morning, I could barely walk, my muscles were so tight.  A word to the wise:  if you are not a person who has worked out in 6 months, you may want to go to bed with a bottle of naproxen after this workout.  I hobbled through the day a little discourage because it had taken such a toll, but then I realized that I literally felt like I'd been at the gym 2 hours.  So I rested that day and came back to it.  And do you know what?  I was a little stiff when I started, but got right back into it and went through it with SO much more enthusiasm on day 2.  I will update down the road, but I'm pretty sure this is a workout I can stick to!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I cannot express the feelings I had while reading throughout this book. It takes me through a never been before journey of the hunger games. Suzanne Collins is forever my favorite author. I can't wait to read Catching Fire. :D she also wrote with such force and power that I stayed up several nights reading and thinking about the the book. I LOVE THE HUNGER GAMES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B007712XAU|5.0|Enjoyed every minute of this.  Ordered season 3 as soon as it was out and just finished watching it.  Can't wait for season 4.  I like watching the DVD's rather than TV.  No waitng for &#34;next week&#34;
B000JMKRKC|4.0|Recommended by my sister...I felt it represented the culture of dictatorship where woman had no rights, like Iran or SA.
B00A31UXLW|2.0|I could not get engaged into this one and was disappointed as I like Michael Connelly a lot. The characters were cold and not &#34;real&#34; enough! It is too American and then I mean too much bang bang. The Europeans are better at it like Jo Nesbo, where the caracters become your friends!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a great book. Its nice to read a love story with lots of unexpected twists. Definitely worth reading.
B008035H16|5.0|I was surprised to find out it was a comic book format. I tried to get it to work on my kindle touch but it wouldn't work. So I updated and restarted it, and it still didn't work. Until I just decided to read it on mi iPad.. But it was a good read, definitely worth the short time spent
B008X8P8A8|1.0|I am disappointed by the mix of puzzle-solving in with tactics. It's tedious taking the time to fit the pieces together before you can play. Ugh!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is fun with just enough challenge to keep it interesting. I've played the other flow free games as well.

B004I654WQ|4.0|This is the Blu-ray version of the first Cars movie from Disney. I'm upgrading my collection of DVDs slowly but surely. When shopping for Blu-rays, be sure to check the country code listed. There are many discs listed that are not for the US (A/1) country code.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The Hunger Games benefits from a style that's both teen-age readable, but adult flavored in character development and plot. Collins succeeds where amateurs like Stephanie Meyers or E L James fail, in that she can appeal to readers en masse without insulting their intelligence. It's easy enough for teenagers and adults to navigate, but it leaves much for all audiences to contemplate; The main social commentary being one that addresses an unapologetic, autocratic government and its struggle to control its oppressed, starving and dying citizens.<br /><br />The series is a coming of age tale set in a post apocalyptic United States, ala Brave New World or Ender's Game. It focuses on its young, teen-aged protagonist Katniss Everdeen and her struggle to stay alive using her skills of rugged survival and her love of family. Collins incorporates elements of present day societal preoccupation with with reality television, elimination style games and violent sports theatrics. Katniss must use her wit and dedication to family in order to make wise, prudent decisions while she is a victim of her governments cruel, barbaric gladiator games.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is easy enough to blaze through in just a night's worth of reading, but it's intelligent enough to have you either reading it again or scouring the internet for a suitable discussion board to share your thoughts and propositions. My biggest gripe is that amazon seems to be gouging buyers with a hefty price tag for such an easy perusal. Melville and Dumas are much cheaper and far harder to discern. If you're a prime user, you can borrow any of the books in the series for free, but only one book per month. Still, I advise you to do just that before you invest a lot into this relatively simple trilogy. If nothing else, there are plenty of readers that i'm sure someone is more than willing to lend you their copy. Take advantage of that!<br /><br />I encourage any user looking for a good read this month to check out thefirst chapter in the HG trilogy or continue your journey through the story and pick up book 2 or 3. Even if you're not a fan of the genre, you'll still be entertained. I Guarantee!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Enchanting book.  Fun to read.  I was surprised by the ending.  It had the texture of Ireland woven through it.
B000I9S69K|5.0|It's hard to write a review of such an old chestnut that virtually everyone has seen. This movie wrote the book on plot twists, and is fun every step of the way. All the elements are there: writing, acting, production values. Newman was never better than in the poker game. Just great entertainment from start to finish.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|This is a good hidden object game, but it wasnt really a challenge, no secrets and not really scary, but pretty awesome all the while.
B008Y1RTUG|4.0|I was not disappointing... The visuals were excellent, and the costuming was amazing. Some really great moments in this film where the art of the film and the storytelling really come together splendidly. Charlize Theron as the wicked stepmother was amazing, but the rest of the acting was a little lackluster. None of it was bad, mind you, but no one else in the film really shone the way Charlize Theron did. Kristen Stewart wasn't bad, but I don't think she was the right choice for the part, honestly -- she's got the looks for Snow White, but the second half of the film demanded someone with a bit more conviction as &#34;strong-willed revolutionary&#34;, and Kristin just didn't deliver that convincingly: she's spent too much of her acting career pouting.<br /><br />The story was great. Whoever plotted this film deserves some serious kudos. The writing, on the other hand, was a bit heavy-handed, even to the point of dipping into the cheese sometimes. Not that that's necessarily bad in a fairy tale film, but there was the potential for this to be real masterpiece, and some of the scripting just really threw that out the window.<br /><br />Overall, totally enjoyable, visually stunning, good story, but some of the scripting and some of the acting brings it down from amazing. Watch it, you'll like it.
0143122061|2.0|If you've read other books on the history of the &#34;Rise of the West&#34;, don't bother with this one.  By the standards of the genre, this isn't particularly good.  No new insights here.  On the contrary, he veers off or throws up his hands whenever he stumbles near an important issue.  For example, his explanation of why the Ming dynasty failed to develop on a modern path is pathetically weak.  You would think the author of The Ascent of Money would explore the effect of paper money on the Ming economy.  Nope.  The focus is on symptoms and silly analogies.  Not clear he even knows the subject matter.<br />I was impressed by some of the author's recent lectures, so I had hoped for more here.  As some of the other reviewers have said, this seems banged out to make money.  I give it two stars for occasionally entertaining vignettes.  Popular history in the worst sense.
B0084TWN9K|4.0|Alice Munro. I have been reading her since the 90s and in each book, each story, I'm captured by the character's stories and the gloom and despair of the Canadian winter landscapes. These stories will stay with you, long after you are finished reading. If I missed any she has written, I will go back and find them! Mahalo Ms. Munro!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is good but after awhile it gets boring because you have to save up TONS  points but overall good game.I now am wasting words to fill in my twenty word limit so I can submit this.
0525478817|4.0|I'm a grown parent of a preteen and I've never heard of John Green. In fact, I didn't even glance at the author's name on the cover, and when I got done, I was shocked to read the author's bio and find out he was a man. That is how well I feel Green captured the voice inside a teenage girl's head. I'm also not ashamed to admit I, like the narrator, instantly had a massive crush on Gus, the male half of the teen couple who meet in a cancer support group. While you do have to suspend disbelief a bit to buy that there are not two, but three (including Gus's best friend) kids with the same dry wit and intelligence in the same group who all find each other, it was worth it. I read this book in one night, not putting it down (except to reach for the Kleenex so I could wipe off the tears and snot so I could see to keep reading). This book is funny, sad, takes unexpected turns, and all of the characters are well drawn, including the parents. I also appreciated that it didn't get heavy into sex (SPOILER: the two do have sex, but it is implied, not described). I put off reading this book out of fear it would be too painfully sad, but I'm so glad I did read it. I would recommend this for age 14 and up or maybe mature 13 year olds.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great app. Its fun for anyone of any age. Good app to play when you are bored too. It has moments when it freezes up but not enough to crash.
B004DNWPY4|5.0|Unexpected results in listing the contrast to the Hollywood concept of wealth and prosperity. Very informative yet realistic views mixed in with facts. I am going to go out and make my fortune.
B0043RSK3K|5.0|I picked this up after seeing one of the TV episodes -- I have always thought I was pretty astute on history but this book proved me wrong -- if 15% is true (and I think a lot of it is true) ... I am pretty ashamed of things we have done in the name of freedom, Christianity, and the \\"American way\\" -- the only one that get a mixed and sometimes upbeat profile is Kennedy ... all of the other presidents pretty much back to Teddy Roosevelt were pretty ugly people and have left this country in a pretty sad state -- both domestically and internationally -- we should be embarrassed for putting these folks in office

B008AK8FHM|4.0|It is a personal experience that Dr. Alexander has gone through. It leads to many many questions regarding LAD experiences. It has a rich bibiography that adds to documenting that experience. Good reading...
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Really a great program, is getting me super organized. I'm almost completely paperlerss at home. Long way to go at work, but I'll get there someday. Only con, no love for Linux, need to use web app.
0307352145|5.0|I bought this book because it was a finalist for the Books For A Better Life Award along with my book.  Finally, a book about the awesomeness of being quiet in such a fast paced world.  The book explains so much about personality types and celebrates the experiences of the person who prefers to observe rather than rush in with talking.<br />R.

B00BWJARHO|3.0|We were glad we could rent The Hobbit from amazon streaming weeks before redbox or netflix.  We enjoyed the movie, but the quality of the streaming video is rough at times.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|This is by far the best Temple Run I've played yet. I absolutely love this game, there is so much to do
0375507256|5.0|I got this as a gift for my girlfriend who loved the movie. She loved the book as well, and I would recommend it to anyone who loves unique adventures.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|While my exposure to Muse might not be as long as some fans can say they've had, in recent months, Muse has quickly climbed to the top of my list of favorite artists. Some can make the valid point that at times they can be a bit \\"over-the-top\\", or the fact that their material may not be up to par with other alt-rock acts of the early 2000s, but Muse does have an unique quality. This being the fact that even through their rough spots, they still manage to pull off what they attempt with a notable amount of success and credibility. This album, however, is far from one of their rough spots.<br />Absolution, being Muses third album in their discography, was basically their first exposure to the US after debate with their distributor about falsetto usage in earlier releases. This album covers various different sounds from the band, from the slower songs such as \\"Endlessly\\" and \\"Ruled by Secrecy\\", to more heavy songs like \\"The Small Print\\" and \\"Stockholm Syndrome\\". Throughout all of the songs, the instrumentation, done by band members Matt Bellamy, Dom Howard and Chris Wolstenholme, always seems to fit the tone of the songs spot on. If it be the heavy piano chords on what's basically the opening song \\"Apocalypse Please\\" where Matt details the wanting of the end of the world to come, or the somewhat bass-driven song \\"Hysteria\\" that tells of emotions eating away at someone's head. Not a single song really seems to slack off compared to others, even though they do have their slower and faster moments. The album opens the doors to more subjects, like the song \\"Butterflies and Hurricanes\\" which is more about how you've \\"got to be the best\\" in the world we live in. In some ways the album is arguably a step up from the previous release \\"Origin of Symmetry\\", yet in some ways it might be viewed as a step down. Personally I consider the two albums to be a tie, but both are great releases in their own way.<br />If you're a fan of Muse, I would definitely recommend this album, as ithas the potential of some of Muses best work. If you want to get into Muse, this and Origin of Symmetry are two good places to start out. Even if you aren't familiar with Muse and you're just looking for a good alternative rock album, this isn't by any means a bad choice.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|waiting to see how it all ends or begins again. Not as new as it used to be but still keeps us coming back for more.
B0046B3QTG|4.0|Not just a barrel of laughs (though there are plenty) this had a great message about parenting in it as well.<br /><br />Some parents might not like the fact that it's really a movie about a bad person, who does bad things - but the lesson in this movie (without too many spoilers) is that he gets what he has always wanted in the end - his mothers approval and the love of others - by finally doing the right things. I'm not sure many young kids will get that message on their own, but it gives some good fodder for discussion with kids. Kids misbehaving could be compared to the 'Despicable' characters in the movie - and that the right way to get approval may not be from trying to steal and cheat, etc.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I choose Pinterest because of the simplicity & efficiency of sharing something good or bad! I recommend it to everyone!
B009H442DG|3.0|If you're a John Travolta or fan your an enjoy his singing -er- &#34;style&#34;.  Olivia always sounds great and the special guests like Streisand aren't bad.  But a Hot Holiday &#34;Have to have&#34; it's not.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Too bad that there will not be a 4th novel based on these characters. A fitting conclusion to a great series.

B000059RNA|5.0|I remembered this show when I was a kid.  I always loved it and do not see reruns on TV.  So I had to buy it.  The product was exactly as described.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|we love the whole series. and Season Five was the icing on the cake. Definitely not to be missed, The DVD set was nicely packaged.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is a wonderfull book.<br />I like the audio format.<br />The purchase was without issues... I want to read all the trologi
B00BSBY38A|4.0|At times a bit slow but I loved the ambiguity of the story. &#34;What was the true story?&#34; For you to decide!
B001EAWMGA|5.0|I first saw this movie when it randomly showed up on TV.I love Sci-fi and this movie immediately grabbed me. I also love James Caviezel. It has an interesting story line as seen through the eyes of an alien landing on earth in the 8th century among Vikings.Unfortunately he has unknowingly brought a very lethal beast along for the ride and it is disgusting,smart and just plain evil. How he transforms himself into a Viking and goes after the beast is wonderful tale. I really think you will enjoy this one. Why it had a very limited theater run is beyond me. It deserves better and I hope it sells millions of cds!
B003Y5H5BA|5.0|I love this movie! I watched twice in theaters and was so excited when the blu ray came out! Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are perfect together!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Great little apt simple and easy to use top apt would recommend to any body,a must have piece of software to keep an eye on battery status
B006GECE9Y|4.0|I started having browser trouble with my Android tablet, where it would lock up, so I downloaded Dolphin and it has worked flawlessly for about a week. Maybe it deserves five stars...?
1439153663|5.0|I very much enjoyed the book.  Passed it on, and others liked it too!! It is an easy read. Enjoy!
B00947N6UG|5.0|This movie has a heart warming story that's appropriate for all ages. There is some fight scenes where each character uses their powers according to the holiday they take care of or related to their name. I chose to purchase this movie because I saw it in theaters and loved it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have always enjoyed playing solitaire. This game is just another set of cards. The cards are colorful; there are many backgrounds trim which to chose. For wasting time the game is quick and fun. Nothing real special about this game. But it is fun just as solitaire is supposed to be. Have fun playing! And the price is right.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I think it is cool and the bird species of birds are the most important thing that you can see, and the world's largest online marketing campaign is one that I played the game and boots on this page is a very small number and I think that this game for about an important thing is that I don't like the world is not a big deal of sex games for the most common type and boots are a few weeks of birds in this case is one thing I played with no longer have a big part is one that.<br /><br />Chicken
B0091REZMW|1.0|I'll never know how good this game is because I cannot see it.  It's very disappointing that my 9inch Kindle can't display it well.  Do the developers ever read the reviews?
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|The new Series Rocks!!  Great directing, Great Acting.  Love all the action and intrigue.  You just can beat a well put together action thriller.  Would make a great movie!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I thought this would be a silly game to purchase, but then I played a bit... and I was hooked! Fun, silly, and contagious.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|This movie is unrated for a reason. There is a lot of blood and violence in it and some coarse language. I chose to purchase this movie because how realistic they kept with the fighting. There wasn't anyone flying through the air doing flips and spins before hitting the opponent. They kept more to the basics of self defense in the real world (Survival combat). There is some story to the movie and really awesome music. Another reason I chose to purchase this movie is because Mike Shinoda from Linkin Park worked on the soundtrack, and I love Mike Shinoda's work!
B001BKTEZA|5.0|John Steinbeck is one heck of a writer. Even though it is so very detailed, it did not make me feel bogged down .  On the contrary,  it made me feel as though I were there traveling with the Joads.  A most remarkable book.  I couldn't put it down.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This is probably the funnest game I've played on my cell phone. Its got great graphics, nice choice in music,and it runs quite smoothly on my Motorola droid RAZRM. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS GAME IT IS SOOO FUN AND MOST OF ALL FREE! (:
B001MCYZJC|4.0|While it is not with Ozzy, Dio brings a nice vibe to this album, starting with Neon Knights which I prefer over the hit of Heaven and Hell but it is a solid album all the way through
B0090CVJZ4|5.0|took a few trys to get the wires to stay in,no info on how they are supose to be put in so they stay so took a little trial and error to get it right once i got it was great. Now i can unplug my speakers and move them and plug them back in in no time no more screwing down terminals.
0312641893|5.0|I hate that I have to wait for a year and then another year to get to all of this story. These characters are so fun. I love how the classic cinderella tale is woven into this futuristic society. Make sure you read the second one too - Scarlet, which is Red Riding Hood and the Wolf!  Fun, fun, fun.
B000GCFY0I|4.0|I was looking for a book with a distopian society(other than hunger games) and I came across the uglies series. Great book, I'll definitely read the rest.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|It does what you need it to do. I've slept for years with an air cleaner fan on in my room and now I can't sleep without some kind of noise in the background. This is especially nice when I am away from home.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is amazing! The quality for instant steaming is great! Don't miss this series - it's got humor, serious, and of course love.
B001MKQS4O|5.0|Great movie. The acting, story line and filming were excellent.  I am just sorry I waited so long to watch it.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|Great fun once you get past the glitch in the first half where the hint keeps sending you back to the safe on the office wall. Turning the pages of the book on the desk in the office gets you the key to the cabinet so you can proceed with things.  I enjoyed it a lot once I found the solution to the glitch on an Amazon app forum.  Had to knock off a couple stars for such a bad glitch.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Game of Thrones is an excellent series.  If you like this TV series, try the book series &#34;The First Law&#34; by Joe Abercrombie.  Not the same author that this show is based on, but an excellent, dark series of the same genre.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Exciting book.  Kept reading to see how it would end.  Couldn't put it down.  Why do you need more words?
B007SGM084|5.0|I was glad I purchased the trilogy. I don't see how the movie will be as good as the book, though.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I enjoy the message of this show, accepting others regardless of their status in life is more important than money or things.  It has been hard to see some of the characters leave but it brings more reality to this show.
B000001ESP|4.0|On this record Rush started composing short, focused and poular songs like Limelight and Tom Sawyer. They were begining to leave behind complex Progressive Rock and start having world-wide success. It is the most loved studio record for fans. Tough I love the Progessive Years I like the new sound as well that started here.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|A game you can play all day build your base, fight the enemy, bounty hunt and earn rewards. way better then tank ace
B004GUSG4M|5.0|A real page-turner.  I hardly left it until I finished it.  A remarkable first book that keeps you guessing throughout.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|WOW, I was really impressed by this work. I've been a King fan for most of my life and this book reminded me why. It hooks you in at the start and just leads along until the final ending. I really didn't want it to end. It is truely outstanding. Bravo!!
B00BGIC170|4.0|funny movie telling the truths around the 40s. nice comedy! it is worth to rent it. do not buy it.
B00136NUG6|5.0|Earth Wind & Fire music never ages.<br />Even my son enjoys this music.<br />It is great music to listen to while traveling.
B0095P33IW|4.0|I haven't figured out how they made him buff up and grow a few inches or how the made him incredibly short, but I did enjoy the movie
0316077046|5.0|I really enjoy the books and it was pricedd fairly. Shipping took a couple weeks, which to me is slow, however the book was in great condition and is an excellent read.
B0034G4OZE|5.0|Great movie. I bought it without knowing what it is about. So worth it. Not what I expected - in a good way!!
B005COO1X6|5.0|really interesting short story. Short being the keyword here. Typical King. Reliable and full of details. Leaves you wanting more.
B000002ADT|5.0|This was my first jazz album. I was 20 yrs old. I was changing my priorities in life. I decided to try something new and purchased this album. It was one of the best things I could have ever done at that time of my life. This album convinced me that I had spent most of my life ignoring real music. Kind of Blue was my epiphany. I had no idea that it included one of the greatest rhythm sections in jazz history. I had no idea that it included one of the greatest tenor saxophonists we've ever known in John Coltrane (subjective because of Charlie Parker and others). And add Cannonball Adderley (who would later make another one the greatest albums ever made, \\"Somethin' Else\\"). The group alone is to music like winning the lottery, seeing a shooting star, falling in love... Many great albums by other artists and groups have followed but this album set a standard that I have not seen matched still 50+ years after being produced. I LOVE THIS ALBUM. It is forever on my playlist. I'm not a lover of everything Miles Davis. Nor a lover of everything John Coltrane. But man... they did it on this one. I'm so happy this album is still readily available.

111846446X|4.0|Clearly sets out how to get your Raspberry Pi up and running.  Some concepts are vague If you are new to Linux.
0061692034|2.0|I kept waiting for this book to get interesting or at least compelling. As a Canadian who now lives in \\"The States\\" (as Ford put it), I could relate to some of the themes of being lost in a new place and trying to make a new beginning. I just felt that this book didn't have enough emotion or story to hold the interest of the reader. I had to force myself to finish it. As a story about how events could shape a life, it was just too slow moving to make any significant impact.
B000007UXS|1.0|The sound on This Pressing sounds like They Used a Highly Compressed Cd as the Source Material...Unlistenable with booming Bass and no Highs---Sounds as Bad as My Copy of Joe Walsh (The Best Of)....Hate To Say it but The CD Sounds 100 Times Better...On The Plus Side The Heavy Vinyl Would Make A Decent Frisbee--
1401323952|5.0|For some reason when this book came out I didn't<br />perceive it as a recipe book - duh!!<br /><br />I don't know why.<br /><br />I passed it over thinking it was suggestions on<br />what to have in your kitchen, like some kind of<br />promo for her products.  No idea where I got that.<br /><br />So glad it came across my path again.<br /><br />I've never, ever been one to collect anything,<br />but I've GOT TO have all the Nigella books.<br /><br />I love the stories connected to the recipes.<br />I look at them as a 'good read' and love, love,<br />love the photography.  I sure wish she would<br />re-do How To Eat and add photos.<br /><br />This book has a recipe  for Grasshopper Pie<br />- if you've not had it, give it a try<br />even just for the sake of nostalgia.
B008JFUN8C|5.0|If you are truly a fan of \\"Oz\\", you be thrilled with this movie. One of the scenes when the wicked witch of the west is similar to the older movie. I will not spoil the story....go see it!
B0000AOV85|5.0|I love the isolations of the music.  and seeing the equipment thay used to create one of the best albums ever recorded.
B001A4LYN2|5.0|Great movie. I am a big fan of Daniel Dey Lewis. He is a great actor and deserved the Oscar for this role. I give it 2 thumbs up.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|It is great because I can put a note on my phone and then see it when I get at work or at home on the computer.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|I didn't realize that after downloading the game, I would have to be connected to the internet to play the game. With limited access to the internet, I can't afford to let my grandchildren play the game.  Also, the game is confusing to play.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Like magic. A great adventure...great fun and unique. Not sure I have read anything like this in the past.  Special.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|As all of the Die Hard movies Bruce does feates of magic in his defense against the dark arts. I really enjoyed the computer nerd and his becoming a hero.  Great idea and their partnership worked.  Didn't like the language. I edited out all the swearing and made it more fun.
B00A83075M|5.0|I guess the previews weren't that enticing so I never took the kids to the theaters to watch it. But once I rented it, I fell in love with the unique story, characters and plot. The message in the movie is great, be who you are because that is what makes you special, it's a story about friendship and acceptance, and sacrifice. Must watch and highly recommend!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is amazing 100 percent awesome epicness!!!!!!!!!!!!!Get it its AWESOME.....DOWNLOAD NOW that. It works really well and is like mega addictive. TRUST ME YOU WON'T DELETE IT!!!!!!
B005S9EK1S|5.0|I look forward to watching this movie, I had heard it was a great movie to add to my collection! Thank you for the prompt delievery and great condition too!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Watched the movie, and liked it, so decided to read the book as always books are so much better. Can't wait to read the next one!
B00BF11STU|5.0|Movie seemed to be a fairly accurate reprentative of what really went on. An intense movie well worked.A heart pounder of a diffferent kind. Loved it!
B003UYUQZW|5.0|This was a great adventure of brotherly commradery and trust.  It captures the magic of arabia like Alladin.  I felt the ostriches was a weak component in the story.  Where as the Assasins added suspence.
B005S9EKCW|3.0|I grew up in the theatre, and I knew the songs of this musical before I had ever known the whole storyline. I am one of those people who love musicals, just because they are musicals. I can forgive a lot of campiness and rough edges just because I love the storytelling and emotions of it all. So, one can imagine just how BADLY I WANTED TO SEE THIS! I pre-ordered it online, just knooowing that it was going to be one of the greats in cinematic storytelling. ...The Blu-Ray arrived in the mail, I prepared the entire evening for pure uninterrupted musical enjoyment. And then-- The singing began. My heart instantly sank to the floor, feeling as flat as Russell Crowe's notes.    This is one of the world's greatest musicals ever written -- It is meant to be sung by some of the greatest voices we have today. Musicals need to be cast with singers who act, as opposed to actors who try to sing.    This is how it is supposed to be sung: (Live Broadway singers sing at the \\"10th Anniversary Concert\\" --HUGE difference in quality of singing!)  [...]
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Lots of brain challenges.  A lot of game for the money.  I couldn't stop playing. Very challenging and fun. Get this game!
B0081336FO|5.0|I really enjoy watching movies on Amazon Prime. It is fast and has many choices in many genres!  I can find something for all age levels
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Life in North Korea is Big Brother at all times, but it is the norm for its people.  The level of acceptance for the intrusions and barbarity is what I found so disturbing. The lead character is an &#34;orphan&#34;, the lowest class of citizens, farmed out for the most brutal forms of work that no one else will do, named for &#34;heroes of the revolution&#34; so that their name identifies them as an orphan for the rest of their lives.<br />Reading it was a bit of voyeurism--looking at the life of this man at a very intimate level, I kept wanting to turn away.  I hated the ending, but it was appropriate within the context of this totalitarian state.<br />It has left me curious about how much is true of the North Korean system, where did the author get his information?  The book has stayed with me--a testament to the story and the writing.
B004J88SGC|5.0|sit back and let old Billy  sing to you .. loved it too good to pass up nice try it
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I liked the contrast between life on earth and mars.  I enjoy sci-fy and history.  I don't like the swearing.

B008Z9L94O|5.0|everything came as expected. really like the large booklets. sounds great on vinyl--which is to be expected. one of my favorite albums on my favorite format--SCORE!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This is a great book, even for those not in a marriage. I found this book eye opening to those around me.
B002ZG99QS|4.0|The update of graphics and stunt work was excellent.  The movie seemed more serious than the first.  Flynn gave no indication he was a hippy in first movie. His hippy/hari krishna additon seem contrived. It needed more humor in the dialogue.
B0019N95IK|3.0|I hate to make my review about just one thing, visual quality, but to me it was the most critical reason to upgrade from DVD to Bluray. I've had Enterprise on DVD ever since it was available, so I knew what I was getting in terms of the quality of the show itself.  I love Star Trek, so I'd feel remiss if I didn't have all of the seasons of all four shows as well as The Animated Series.<br /><br />I had this on preorder, so I hadn't the chance to read the reviews on sites like The Digital Bits and Bluray.com before I purchased it.  Even then, it's hard not to treat video quality subjectively, which makes it difficult for me to accept a review until I see the video with my own eyes.  With TNG, for example, the differences between the DVD and the Bluray versions were so striking I felt I was seeing the episodes the way they were meant to be seen for the first time.  Although the reviews had indicated this, until I had seen it I would never have believed how remarkable the difference was.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this Enteprise Bluray simply doesn't measure up to those other efforts.  The remastered TOS and TNG Blurays are vibrant, clear, and sharp.  CBS put in a remarkable effort to restore them, resulting in nearly reference-quality video that's even competitive with modern shows.  Enterprise episodes, in contrast, look soft and washed out, with muted colors and even some noise.  The blacks are flat instead of conveying a sense of deep space. In many ways, I feel like I'm watching an upscaled DVD, with many of the compression problems inherent to the older format.<br /><br />Perhaps I'm spoiled in this day and age, but when a closeup of an actor's face remains fuzzy, you can barely pick out individual hairs on their head, and their uniform looks dingy when it should look vibrant, I can't help but feel underwhelmed and even disappointed.<br /><br />As Bluray.com noted, perhaps someday they will be able to go back and give this series the treatment it deserves.  Untilthen, we have this Bluray which just barely drags itself across the threshold of \\"HD.\\"
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|It was a great movie great color great scenes good action not a thing wrong with it I would buy another one
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Enjoyed Season 2 as much as Season 1. Again, very well done.  Can't wait for Season 3 to air this winter.
B007P6PLDI|5.0|came in one piece, sounds wonderful! nothing like the warmth of records, especially with the songs on this album. they are more lo-i sounding than the big studio albums, so this particularly sounds good to me.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|\\"Old Man's War\\" is exactly what it promises to deliver.  Guns. Guts. Glory.  Characters nicely fleshed out and a wonderful time is had as you watch them grow into their new selves.  It is a great concept (and from what I hear a soon to be made movie).  So read this book before they screw it up on the silver screen.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|It reminds me of Black Beauty for adults. The cinematography was fantastic and I did not recognize Emma Watson until the credits even though I kept thinking I knew her from somewhere.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I would recommend this product. I especially like the kitchen scenes as I have spent most of my life cooking meals and cleaning up. I often say, joking, I was born to be a scullery maid.
B009ICQ6KO|3.0|I saw these two on Tavis Smiley's show and was loving there enthusiasm about this project. It fell short! Thanks
0375424474|5.0|Great product and service! Definitely a great and easy book to read if you are interested in evolution and comparative anatomy.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Mitch Rapp is as entertaining as ever in this one.  Another highly recommended fun read.  Vince Flynn delivers to the reader again.
B00BHMF578|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Especially the fact that it was suspenseful even though we know the outcome - I was still on the edge of my seat.
B0016K40KO|5.0|I love history and learned a lot from the movies, at least enough to know some basics. Maybe history classes in school should be taught through movies since the yougner generation seems to place so much of what they value on what is on the big screen. I was also thoughtful enough to know that movies are based on facts and then go research to determine what is truth and what is Hollywood. This is a great one with great performances.
B007PKDW44|5.0|I love this band.  Am not usually a huge heavy metal fan but this group is just great, they have an extra oomph or something that made me pay attention.
055380684X|5.0|I purchased the Talent Code about 2 years ago and have been using the methodology in my coaching/teaching. I also have had a few parents of students that I have suggested read the book so they have a better understanding of exactly what it is we are about to do and embark on. This is a great book for anyone that believes that hard work is the only limiting factor in producing success at elite levels.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Beautiful book like all of Nicholas Sparks books. The movie does not even compare. The book is a must read.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Unrecognizable, Anthony Hopkins nails his portrayal of Alfred Hitchcock. It was fascinating to learn more about this complex man in the context of the creation of his great movie, Psycho. Helen Mirren, as always, gave a strong performance as his wife and essential co-creator, Alma.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Initial play is straight forward. Haven't played beyond the first section, but I expect the rest to be at least as entertaining. Great for filling time between appointments.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I loved this movie and so did other family members. This was a gift for one of my sons, I enjoyed it at the theater with another son.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is great for the kindle fire hd and it is very entertaining and the graphics are awesome. The upgrades make it twice as fun and very easy .  It is very fun and cheap for such a quality app
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Both a realistic and an optimistic read of a horrific chapter in human history.  Frankl leaves the reader aware of the human capacity for both great good and great evil, while focusing on building redemptive lives based on hope.
0762434279|3.0|i didn't know that the book is small but it works for me, it came in a decent time and
B001K3K5MO|5.0|I had to order a DVD because my VHS player quit and we could no longer enjoy this. Still haven't received it in the mail but am looking forward to it.
B00BSBT8M6|1.0|colorful movie, but too surealistic! and I did not get the message. I think the director was too occupied by creating the imagi.ary scenes that forgot the content.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I already have the regular one, but bought a blu ray player because i wanted to see it in the impressive color and special effects that you see on the theater
B00555X8OA|5.0|It's an easy read but don't expect to fly through this book. It is packed with info and you'll want to take your time.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was filled with so many unexpected twists and turns. I loved getting some insight on Christian's views of certain situations throughout the series. Great ending to a great series!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun game. Nice graphics. I recommend it to everyone! Only thing is the energy requirements tend to stop play.<br />If it is free it should be free.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I read the book when I was in 8th grade and loved it, didn't get to see the movie (with Liam Neeson) until many years afterward. Even though I have friends who saw the musical on stage I had not heard the music either. Then as I was flipping through the channels on TV one night, I happened upon this presentation on my local PBS station and I absolutely could not move from in front of the TV. I had to have this.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|There is a plot twist that will keep you wondering. Graphics were very good, and the use of a Bagel Tiger was most interesting.
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|I'll give it props for the interesting set design, but the story suffered for it. It was hard to tell who was what to whom, and then there was just sex sex sex. Lost interest after about 30 minutes in. Boo.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Well written and engaging. I haven't read anything in this genre that captivated me like this since I read Isaac Asimov as a young boy. Kudos to Mr. Howey.
0451527712|5.0|This story has been around for over 200 years and it will always be timely and relevant. The story explores what it means to be human from several sides. You feel empathy for both Dr. Frankenstein and &#34;the Monster&#34; as they both elaborate on their inner most wrenching thoughts and regrets.<br />I had no idea what to expect from this book and it turned out to be one of my all time favorites. There's no violence or gore, only the remote suggestion left to the reader's interpretation. There are, though, timeless descriptions of many well known spots in Western Europe, and the yearnings of &#34;the Monster&#34; to be accepted and valued by other humans. These are just some of the elements that signify this book's eternal value as a treasure.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Fun and addicting. Great for a beginner. helps to pass the time for me.<br />My grandchildren have a lot of dun.
B005IEGUDY|5.0|I heard about this from a friend years ago and just never gort around to reading it, now that I have my Kindle it seemed like the right time to do so.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I was told dont bother with this one its no good, so i rented it on a whim.. what a great movie, i really enjoyed it and my 3 year old couldnt get enuff.. its ALOT better than alot of cartoon movies as of lately.
