0385504209|5.0|Dan Brown's \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is a gripping page-turner.  It has the same pace as TV's \\"24\\" - a sleuth needs to solve an impossible puzzle in 24 hours.<br />A museum curator is murdered, but in death leaves clues to a century-old secret.  A Harvard expert on religious symbolism and a French detective chase the clues through murder and mayhem.  Around each bend we meet multi-dimensional characters - a few on the border of genius and madness.<br />The plot is creative, yet unpredictable.  In addition to enjoyment, the reader gets and education in religious history and symbolism - although quite a bit comes from the author's rich imagination. The language is realistic.  The speed is spell-binding.  It is a great read and I am exploring Brown's last novel.  Enjoy!
0553573403|5.0|Ive just been rereading A Game of Thrones, partly as an antidote to having read Crossroads of Twilight. This reading has confirmed to me the excellence of the book. Things that I really like about it are:<br />The realism of the medieval setting.<br />The low amount of magic denies the characters easy outs from difficult situations,<br />The wide variety of characters. All of them flawed in their different ways, each has their noble characteristics. Each character has a reasonably distinctive voice when the story is told from their point of view. Some of the characters are rather unsympathetic, but they all behave in line with their character.<br />The unpredictability of the story. No character is safe. It is not clear who are the long term heroes. I have to say that the first time I read it I assumed for a long time that Eddard Stark was the hero.<br />The pace of events. Some reviewers on these pages reckon nothing happens, but characters change, die, treachery and betrayal, wars start, alliances shift. Many issues get resolved (unlike CoT for example).<br />Im looking forward to the next book in this series.

B00008S2VG|4.0|What I've always loved about Madonna is her willingness to try new things.  Granted, when I first listened to this CD, I didn't think it was her best...but if you're a fan of Madonna, you're sure to love this CD regardless.  After listening to it a few times, you begin to get into the rhythm of the CD (a lot of guitar strumming) and really enjoy it.<br />The lyrics aren't the best, but I think Madonna is just trying to appeal to a younger audience who is obsessed with rap and songs that have nothing to offer but simple words and meanings.  At any rate, this CD is definitely a keeper in my book.
B00005JKCH|5.0|I have to agree with Bill Murphy about this one. I was expecting this film to be cheesy and less than enjoyable. I was very wrong. I'm not a comic buff, or a sci-fi/fantasy nut, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film.<br />Tobey Maguire plays the nerdy Peter Parker, who gets bitten by a spider, which in return transforms him into a superhuman being with superhuman powers.<br />The special effects in this are quite stunning, and the acting performances help to maintain a poignant and dreamy atmosphere throughout. Kirsten Dunst is a complete doll as MJ, Peter/Spiderman's love interest, and Willem Dafoe is the menacing Green Goblin.<br />I don't want this to be a long review, so I'm choosing to end it abruptly. If you want a dreamy, poignant, heartwarming film to watch (with all of those excellent special effects to spare), I highly recommend this.
0671027344|4.0|This first novel by Stephen Chbosky captures the voice and spirit of a freshman in high school who would be considered a \\"geek\\" because he's brainy, yet socially awkward.  Similar to a diary format, this boy, Charlie, writes letters to a mysterious \\"friend\\" throughout the course of his freshman year.  You get to see his life and his experiences through his eyes, as he grows as a young individual with the help of friends that he meets throughout the year.  Oft times, it's touching, as you begin to feel sorry for Charlie because he isn't social adept.<br />I haven't read anything else by Chbosky, but I'm sure his other works aren't similar.  He captures the thoughts, feelings, and words of a reserved freshman perfectly.  The voice of the novel is predominantly Charlie throughout the book vs. anything Chbosky has probably written before.  It was a great read...and somewhat emotional at times as you begin to discover more and more about Charlie, his family, and his friends.  I'd recommend this book for anyone who's ever felt like an outsider...whether in high school, before high school, or after high school.
B000002J1F|5.0|_Fragile_ should always be considered a classic in the progressive rock genre, not just because the musicianship is virtuosic, tasteful and unique, but because the majority of it is catchy and accessible as well - something that's very rare in progressive rock as a whole.<br />Jon Anderson's distinctly artistic upper-register, Chris Squire's crunchy basslines, Steve Howe's floating guitar leads, Bill Bruford's tasteful drumming and Rick Wakeman's versatile keyboard work here come together to make a unique, tantalizing brand of music. The album starts off with &quot;Roundabout,&quot; which exemplifies what I was saying in the opening paragraph. This track is ultra-catchy and addictive. The grooves on here (mostly exemplified by Bill's drums and Chris' bass) are hard to resist. Definitely a classic that has aged, and will seemingly continue to age nicely.<br />Next comes the first of five solo pieces: The first two of the five being my absolute favorites. &quot;Cans And Brahms&quot; is Rick Wakeman's impressive arrangement of bits found in the Allegro giocoso (third movement) of Brahms' 4th symphony. He did an excellent job on this (and for the record, Brahms is a favorite of mine amongst many classical composers, and I've heard and own his 4th symphony.) Next comes Jon Anderson's &quot;We Have Heaven,&quot; which is a cerebral piece showcasing his vocal artistry. If you listen carefully, you'll find seven separate (but overdubbed) vocal parts by Jon on here. On the seventh one, he is heard saying &quot;yes.&quot; The following track called &quot;South Side of The Sky&quot; seems to be a standout amongst Yes' many epic-length tracks. There seems to be a bluesy, down-home atmosphere to it, especially in Steve Howe's fluid guitar licks. While it's indeed spacy, it's not as otherworldly as most of their other epics, and seems to maintain a bit of earthiness that some of the other epics didn't.<br />&quot;Five Per Cent For Nothing&quot; is a short track showcasing Bruford's drumming ability, but, don't expect it to be a virtuoso display, as it seems more like a steady groove-oriented workout. &quot;Long Distance Runaround&quot; seems to showcase a slight country influence, mostly heard in Steve's guitar. Other than that, the track is a short little ditty. &quot;The Fish&quot; is Chris Squire's bassline workout, which plays out in something of a 7/4 rhythm, while several overdubbed bass samples are exemplified. Quite a nice track. Catchy and addictive as well. &quot;Mood For A Day&quot; is Steve's acoustic workout. Quite virtuosic, atmospheric and tasteful. The last track called &quot;Heart of The Sunrise&quot; starts out with what may have been Yes' most heavy and aggressive moment up until _Relayer_. The crushing attack borders on classic metal. That theme plays out quite a few times within the 3 1/2 minutes of the instrumental opening, which then gives way to a host of trippy atmospherics and Jon Anderson's faraway-sounding vocals.<br />There isn't much more that I can say. This is definitely a classic in Yes' catalog. In a weird sort of way, I could go as far to say that this is Yes' strongest album (of course, no one can claim to know what is and what isn't anything regarding appreciation of any kind.) There isn't another album quite like this one in their catalog. Highly recommended.'s drumming ability, but, don't expect it to be a virtuoso display, as it seems more like a steady groove-oriented workout. &quot;Long Distance Runaround&quot; seems to showcase a slight country influence, mostly heard in Steve's guitar.

0679735259|1.0|I read the great reviews of this book, so I decided to buy it. Bad move! <BR>I read the first 50+ pages and could take no more. Herr's writing amounted to incoherent ramblings of free association, presumably induced by one of the more potent illicit drugs -  there was no time-line and thus no history as such. To make things worse, his style is pretentious.<BR>Perhaps the book gets better further on, but the fist 50+ pages were all I could stand (as I was on vacation).<br />Instead, I read \\"A Bright Shing Lie: John Paul Vann\\" and Stanley Karnow's \\"Vietnam: a History\\" -- both great books. There are many other fantastic books out there on Vietnam, such as \\"We Were Soldiers Once... and Young\\", \\"The Killing Zone: My Life in Vietnam\\", and \\"A Rumor of War\\" by Caputo.<br />All of these make Herr's book look like the gibberish it is!

B00005JLKB|5.0|Smallville. Excellent portrayal of a young Clark Kent (a.k.a. Kal-El, Superman) and his life on a Kansas farm with his Earthly parents Martha and Johnathan Kent. Everything you could imagine and all the characters you remember that made Superman one of the first and greatest superheroes to grace the planet. Look into Clark's detailed relationship with his closest friend, trusted ally, and one day -- enemy, Lex Luthor. Lana Lang takes on the object of his desires and hopes for the basis of a normal life. Pete Ross stays close by his side through thick and thin. And, Chloe makes even Lois Lane seem like a ghost from the past when you watch this show prequel into the life and adolescence of earth's greatest superhero taking shape.<BR>Comprised of 22 episodes, you'll be absolutely hooked from the first glimpse of a Kryptonian spaceship flaming it's way towards Earth's orbit, right into the \\"Hell on Earth\\" rain of the infamous meteor shower that sets up the beginnings of a legend.<br />Remember though, season 1 is only the beginning of this action-packed, special effects, WB blockbuster series. Get hooked and take up your red cape!! Smallville pleases with AWESOME powers and a PERFECT cast of characters. If you like Superman, this is for you. If you don't like Superman (raised eyebrow) you have no clue what you're missing out on. Bring on the DVD's!!
B00000IPAX|5.0|I first listened to this cd 3 years ago.  I couldn't believe it at first, because every song I heard was amazing.  This cd stayed in my stereo for about a year.  I knew every song by heart then, so i decided to try out other bands.  I looked into bands like sum 41, NFG, mest, sugarcult, simple plan, the ataris, mxpx, good charlotte, goldfinger, and they were all good, but nothing even compares to Blink 182.  By far, enema of the state is their best album, and it is also by far the best album of any band I've ever heard.  Travis knows what he is doing with the drums, tom's nasal vocals and mark's deeper voice make the trio an invincible band.  In concert, they also combine their musical talent with a strong sense of humor.  They also keep on coming out with more and more cd's, and the quality stays somewhat the same.  Although they will never be able to come up with another enema of the state, they have consistently come close take off your pants and jacket and dude ranch.  If you consider yourself a punk fan or a pop fan, then you should already have enema of the state.  Blink deserves everything they have accomplished and for those people that call them sell outs they are just mad that their bands ...  If you dont like blink, then go listen to the backstreet boys.
B00005JKZV|4.0|Sprinkled amongst the 600+ reviews listed here are admonitions to the folks releasing this film on DVD --  apparently a version in August and an extended set in November. I hope someone from New Line (or whoever is responsible) is reading these critiques because I want to add my voice to those who are piqued about this ploy (which started last year with the first installment of the trilogy). To be sure, Peter Jackson's is an exciting interpretation of the Tolkien saga and I will definitely want to add The Two Towers to my DVD library. But this time I am prepared to wait for the extended version (assuming the reports are true) and urge all who care about this movie and want to savor everything that went into making it to do the same. End of review.
B000092ZYX|4.0|First off - Radiohead in my eyes have, in the Bends and OK Computer, produced the best albums of the nineties. Kid A (surprisingly under rated) was a definate grower and also, i think, as potent a force as the afore mentioned and finally with a couple of belters on each album- Amnesiac (Pyramid Song, Knives Out) and Pablo Honey (Blow out, Lurgee) were O.K...<br />The sixth album epitomises Radioheads progressiveness, creativity and unique sound, and has some classic songs, but as an album it doesnt seem to fit together as well as their previous albums, it just feels like a bunch of songs put together- it just fails to flow (eg like The Bends) for me...  <br />1. The album starts with 2+2=5. Stupendous start, this one rocks and Yorkes vocals are superb.<br />2.'Sit Down, Stand Up' good, excellent instrumentally, good vocals but rather slow following the explosive 2+2 start.<br />3.Sail To The Moon is a beautiful track wouldn't look out of place on the Bends...very 'Bullet proofesque'. <br />4. 'Backdrifts' this one is very weak Yorkes vocals and the Electronica driven song does nothing for me, and it made me cringe somewhat.<br />5. 'Go To Sleep' is very guitar driven and very average to be fair.<br />6. Where I End And You Begin is the strongest effort on the album. Excellent bass line, drums and vocals unbelievable...my favourite song on the album.<br />7. We Suck Young Blood It makes you feel weird, a dark, haunting sound but a highlight on the album, classic radiohead. <br />8. The Gloaming, bassy- pure electronica with weird lyrical intervention...very Kid A. Not bad, not great...to be honest i dont know what to make of it...might be a grower.<br />9. The first single There There is again strong, the guitar and the lyrics are good.<br />10. I Will. The shortest on the album but very intimate and delicate lyrics make it one of the best.<br />11. Punchup at a Wedding Has an impressive bass line throughout and good use of the piano. Very strong lyrically. Instantlyimpressive.<br />12. Myximatosis. a very raw and ugly sound. Works brilliantly and epitomises Radioheads creativity and progressive sounds.<br />13. Scatterbrain. I like this one, a real tear jerker.<br />....And Finally to close the album A Wolf At The Door. Extremely dark and very haunting lyrics...everything you would expect on a Radiohead album. Magic.<br />Great individual tracks but a couple of rotters make this album brilliant but not unbelievable like previous Radiohead.<BR>I would love to give this album five stars but it ain't The Bends or Ok Computer...so 4/5 is fair.
B00000J7JO|5.0|Californication is perhaps one of the freshest albums I have seen from the chili's.  Although this album may not necesarily reveal all their top skills, it probably defines themselves as a whole more than any other album I have seen from them.  This defines their complete potential in music making and it brings out their identity and their own genre/style of music.  Their music is fresh; you can listen to it 10,000 times and it will sound new or 'fresh' each time.  The flashy bass lines, and guitar lines work very well together, and unlike many bands today, the bass is a 'driving' one, it's like the engine of each song, along with the drums.  The lyrics are fantastic and the rhymes are unique.  I give this album a true 5/5 as I believe it truely deserves it.
B00009RDG9|4.0|After the critical lambasting surrounding the release of \\"Jade\\", and the lukewarm reception of \\"Rules of Engagement\\",  <BR>'70s cinematic fireband William Friedkin once again galvanizes the soul with \\"The Hunted\\", an impassioned duet, an Oedipal wrestling match, a primal struggle that is his most audacious visual tapestry since \\"To Live an Die in L.A.\\". Under his stellar direction, Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio Del Toro sizzle, stab, and scorch into an immortality of devastation, in this brimstone biblical tale of a soldier who wants to die like a soldier. You'll walk out of the room with grit on your face, having watched this filmic equivalent of a Johnny Cash song from a director who knows God, murder, and the evil that men do.
0380977788|5.0|I found this book a bit derivative of other classic childrens' books -- specifically the Chronicles of Narnia, Alice in Wonderland and some of the original Oz books -- but in stealing from only the best, Gaiman has created a satisfyingly fanciful and truly frightening book.<br />Since I felt parts of the book were lifted from other classics, I thought it was especially fitting that the villain of the piece is a monster who cannot create anything -- she can only copy things that already exist. <br />I read a library copy of \\"Coraline,\\" but I don't think it'll be much longer before I buy a copy of my own. It definitely warrants rereading.
B000001EHS|5.0|I never really liked Def Leppard until I heard this Compilation. Then I bought it, and then I wouldn't stop listening to it. My favorite tunes on here are Pour Some Suger On Me, Photograph, Foolin, Rocket, and Rock Of Ages. I even like the songs that I didn't used to like!
0393307050|1.0|I always prided myself in finishing every book that I started no matter how bad. Patrick O'Brian managed to give me an Ol' Broadside. I just couldn't finish it. I tried but I realised I was wasting too much of a short life. I was hoping that these books would be like a &quot;Sharpe at Sea&quot; type series. Alas it was not to be and reading this left me in the &quot;Doldrums&quot;.
B000089RV6|5.0|I just cannot get enough of this Album! ... This album is simply a silent tribute to the late Bon Scott. Sex, Drugs, and Rock and Roll, is what this masterpiece is all about. Selling more than 19 million copies in the USA, this has got to be the greatest Hard Rock album ever. In this new Deluxe Digipak, you can get behind the music, and see what happened in order to create such a great album.....
B000002BFZ|2.0|My brother and I are big Pearl Jam fans, and I would never skewer No Code out of respect for the band, but No Code clearly was a record-company album and not the passionate Pearl Jam effort your reviewers describe.  The album was rushed and unpolished, and my guess is the execs pushed it into stores sooner than they should have.  There is some respectable material which works great for them live, but this album doesn't even come CLOSE to the work of the first three albums - and to suggest that Ten and Vs. are softer than No Code is preposterous.<br />Thankfully, the albums that follow are a clear sign Eddie and the boys still have their chops (but with all due respect to Matt, we miss Dave).
B000002JPA|5.0|What do you get when you take rock's greatest guitarist, rock's greatest drummer, rock's greatest bassist, rock's greatest keyboardist and rock's greatest vocalist? Duh. Rock's greatest band, of course. Now don't get me wrong. I'm not your typical prog-metal fan in the sense that I've never really been into such bands as Rush, Yes, Genesis or even Queensryche. That said, I have wide and rather varied tastes when it comes to music, listening to everything from Led Zeppelin to Van Halen, Def Leppard to Mr. Big and yes, even Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park. Despite this, the fact remains that while all of the aforementioned bands are highly talented and entertaining, Dream Theater simply BLOWS them out of the water. Regardless of what you want in a song, Dream Theater has it. If it's instrumentation you're looking for, John Petrucci (guitars) and Mike Portnoy (drums) have to be heard to be believed. No exaggeration. And if it's vocals that get you going, then you'll be hard pressed to find a better vocalist than James LaBrie. <BR>Nowhere is Dream Theater's sheer talent showcased better than on their second album, `Images &amp; Words'. Simply put, this CD is one for the ages. It is very honestly in my opinion, THE GREATEST CD EVER. If I could own only ONE CD, this would be the one. <BR>This is an album that has everything. Big, anthemic, hard rock with killer choruses (Pull Me Under, Take The Time), amazingly melodic power ballads (Another Day, Surrounded), mind blowing progressive rock (Under A Glass Moon, Learning To Live, and of course Metropolis Part 1) and even a beautiful little piano driven ballad (Wait For Sleep). Another Day is one of the best songs EVER recorded (hell, even my Mom likes it!), while Pull Me Under has a chorus that will NEVER get out of your head. I bought this CD in 1995, and not a DAY has gone by since when I haven't listened to at least one song from it. In 1999, I was even admitted to hospital for 10 days, all through which it was Images &amp; Words on my trusty Discman that kept me going. <BR>If you are a Dream Theater fan, then you obviously already have this album. If you're looking to get into Dream Theater, then this is the album to start with. And if at all you have ANY appreciation at all for good, satisfying music that it actually takes TALENT to produce, then this is the album for you. No matter where your tastes lie, this is a CD you can never go wrong with. So let Dream Theater's Images &amp; Words pull you under. Don't be afraid!
B000003JBJ|5.0|First of all I want to say that the first guy doesn't know what the hell he's talking about I'm sorry to say that. The genre &quot;Jazz-Funk&quot; is more smooth that regular funk that is the definition of the stile so he just had the wrong expectations of his unawareness. This album is the best in this style it has this very early 80 spirit over it and every song is good. That is very rarely you can say that about a whole album. And it doesn't get to smooth in my opinion and the songs are very variated and not as monotonous as a lot of other records in this genre. <BR>I just love : &quot;Summer's Ended&quot; and &quot;Incognito&quot;.<BR>Incognitos later albums with different musicians are defenently not as good as this album it's amazing.
B000000WJZ|5.0|The first time I heard the pumpkins was on their Gish tour, and I thought they were amazing.  Then I heard Siamese Dream and was blown away.  I saw them twice on their dream tour, as a matter of fact the last rock and roll show I saw was the pumpkins on siamese dream, in 1994 with Reverend Horton Heat and Blind Melon.  This is definitely one of the greatest rock and roll albums of all time.  I bought Melon Collie, but I really never got into it, and I haven't bought a pumpkins album since.  They got a little too artsy for artsy's sake.  If you don't have this album, get it.  You wont be dissapointed.
0790729628|4.0|I am glad to see my opinion validated, I think the film worked better with the narration.  With the narration the film is a brilliant reworking of a film-noir PI movie, which is great, without it it is a run of the mill decent art film.  The movie convieniently side steps many of the issues and ideas in the book that make it so compelling and chooses to concentrate on the detective story.  Leaving out the narration detracts from it all and makes the film more difficult to follow, judging by the directors more recent book adaptations (Black Hawk Down) which over-simplified and failed to adequately explain the story of what happened, he should stay focused and not try and make a good movie into more than what it is.
B000069HK2|5.0|The Used is truly an amazing band.They, along with The Offspring, are the ONLY band that I have ever clicked with right away. I have never heard an album with so much variety. Loud songs like \\"Box Full of Sharp Objects\\" and \\"Maybe Memories\\" are good for when you're feeling angry and ready to kill. When you're feeling mellow and sad you can feed your emotions with, \\"Blue and Yellow\\" or \\"Noise and Kisses\\" or even \\"Poetic Tragedy\\". No matter what you want, you can find it on this album. Also, Bert's vocals are amazing. His voice ranges from a tortured shriek to hauntigly soft and the lyrics are powerful. My advice is that this is a GREAT buy, but be warned if you have heard that catchy tune, \\"The Taste Of Ink\\" and liked it, know that the other songs on this album aren't much like it. But they are still WONDERFUL and you should definitely get this album!
B00005JM03|4.0|\\"The Italian Job\\" is a remake of a classic, but under F. Gary Gray's direction, is surprisingly crisp and well-paced.  No need to detail the plot--revenge of criminals on one of their own, who stole from them.<br />The cast is a great ensemble with the only cast members in break out roles, being the 3 Mini-Coopers featured in the film.  No doubt this will be a BMW Sales Bonanza for the cheeky little Brit auto.  Character development is secondary to the heist and the action, as it should be...too little of the film is in Venice and too much in LA, but what can you do?<br />The music is a refreshing mix, there are laughs sprinkled throughout & enough action for all but the youngest adrenaline jockies.  A sappy ending...they should have stuck with pictures of each of the heist members surrounded by their gold, and called it quits.<br />Definitely worth seeing on the big screen, and again in DVD, where it promises to have some great special effects!
B0006GAO5Y|5.0|Viewed: 6/03, 12/03, 12/05, 5/11<br />Rate: 10<br /><br />6/03: Rocky is a very inspiring film and even the story behind the movie is more inspiring. It is always a cheerful film to watch every time. How can anyone show antipathy for this film? Anyway, the film is deemed to be great for the following two reasons: great acting and great direction. Without them, Rocky wouldn't be Rocky.<br /><br />12/05: Rocky is a very inspiring movie. The concept of the story and the story behind the movie are the same. The film that made Sylvester Stallone an overnight mega-star. If anything I could commend the Academy Awards, it's the award of the Best Picture for Rocky. The film truly deserves the prize. Superb acting comes out out of Stallone, Burt Young, Carl Weathers, Burgess Meredith, and Talia Shire. It's a multi-emotional movie for me, showing Philadelphia in a very realistic way. The \\"Gonna Fly Now\\" scene where Rocky does his training regimen and runs to the top of the steps at the Philadelphia Art Museum always gets me every time I see it. It's a sport story, then a romantic story, and finally a heroic story, definitely of a Greek style. I applaud Stallone's creativity and efforts that he poured into this film. Rocky will always stand out as one of the most thrilling movies for ages.<br /><br />5/11: I had to see Rocky again because it's such an phenomenal film. The best part of the movie is always the training scene with the music Gonna Fly Now. Then, the next one is the superfight between Rocky Balboa and Apollo Creed. That one is the stuff of classics. The seriousness leading to the bout is a must-see. Anyway, I could never get tired of watching Rocky or any of its sequels. Don't forget to visit the Philadelphia Museum of Art to run on the Rocky Steps.

B00008H2LB|4.0|If you only buy one album this year it probally will not be this one, but if you buy ten pick it up. Linkin park's Sophmore album is work of art.  While I would not recomend going to see this band live, there studio work is among the best in the industry. Every riff, scratch, and electroic sound was carfully placed, and the result was amazing.  My only real complaint with Meteora is that every song is so dramatic that it takes some of the fun out of the album.(Come on guys lighten up a little).  Overall the album is good, and if you like rap metal, or techno rock go get this album.
B000092ZYY|5.0|Any hardcore or even slightly faithful Radiohead fan should know that when picking up a new album by then that any expectations of the album should be thrown out the window.  Radiohead's albums are too individualistic and each have their own unique identity and should be looked at for their own worth, not compared to previous work.  Objectivity is the key.  It disturbs me when people say things about this album or Amnesiac like &quot;It's great because they play guitars again&quot; or &quot;It's sort of like a mix of the techno on Kid A and the riffs on the Bends&quot;.  Radiohead is no longer about giving people what they want based on what they liked about their already released music.  They are a band constantly changing and maturing while still sounding like Radiohead in a way only Radiohead can.  It is for this reason that I listened to HTTT as it's own album, not expecting it to sound in particular like anything else.  It is more rewarding to be surprised by what you hear then to be dissapointed because it wasn't what you expected to hear.<br />Let's be frank here.  &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; suffered because they simply weren't ready to put out an album yet and the band didn't really have an identity.  &quot;Bends&quot; was for the most part great but was still flawed by a bit of overly poppy production and I'm sorry to say but some of the molodies that Thom Yorke wrote on the album were bland and uninteresting.  OK Computer had great innovations and the first half of the album is some of the most incredible and original sounding music ever made by a traditional rock line-up, but it loses steam in the second half because they couldn't keep up that level of quality throughout the whole album.  The last couple songs seem to be only half-realized.  Kid A, up until now, is truly their greatest album, and it is only because of the initial shock of the change in direction (which really shouldn't have surprised anybody as much as it did if they would have considered the quantum leaps they had made from album-to-album before Kid A's release) that people failed to realize it was their most flawless album.  Amnesiac suffered because with the exception of the last song the album was a bunch of strung-together, half-realized experiments and not real songs.  Sorry to break it to you, but &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot; is not a good song just because it has a prominent guitar part (In fact, I consider the guitar riff on that song to be the worst one they ever wrote, anything on Pablo Honey excluded).<br />You angry yet?  Well have a point.  I love each of these albums dearly, but they all have flaws which most people seem to gloss over.  So here's my point:  I believe that Hail to the Thief is the closest Radiohead has come to making a completely flawless album.  By the third listen I have grown to love every song.  The sound they conjure up is completely their own, and is not simply a mixture of the sounds they used on their previous albums.  Yorke's voice is abolutely spectacular.  I love the incorporation of piano as a major part of the album.  The instrumentation, whether electronic or organic, drives the songs and never bores me like it did on previous outings.  The only flaw I can find in the album is some of the backgound music is too quiet and Yorke's voice overpowers it, making it too hard to hear at some times.  I will listen to this, as well as any other Radiohead release, and enjoy it's greatness on it's own terms for years to come.
B00004NJJQ|5.0|Not a weak song on this disc. Schenker as noted by just about all other reviewers, is nothing short of phenominal. My only complaint is the drummer was adequate at best. Great disc during a great era for rock and roll.
B000092ZYY|1.0|Any hardcore or even slightly faithful Radiohead fan should know that when picking up a new album by then that any expectations of the album should be thrown out the window.

B00006BS6T|4.0|Oh, when I got this video, I'll tell you now: I believed that it was Sunday Afternoon material. But, my views have changed threefold since then. It really is an epic; a tale of how willpower can survive men of the highest caliber in the most serious and severe conditions. It's Christmas: everyone is in a good mood. But one proud man stands up to the captain: he's had enough of the damn navy: shouting, dying, crying: why should he do it? He tells Gene Hackman, playing the role of the captain. He's upset, and ridicules him bigtime. He sends the pilot and his best buddy to fly recon over Bosnia, now named Bosnia and Herzegovina, but the militia see them and shoot them down. They're the real Milosovich crew. It's a cat and mouse chase: and to cut a long story short, the young pilot's friend gets shot before his own eyes. The pilot runs for miles: through railway stations, explosions, death pits and assassins. People think he's dead. But he gets home safely.<BR>I'll give this video four or even five stars, and as a fictional thing, it really brings home how the military deals with real war situations.
B000002KEV|5.0|Deep Purple is the most underrated rock group.  With that said, &quot;Made in Japan&quot; is the best rock live recording ever.  I usually shy away from statements like that, but if one analyzes each song and the players, one might understand why I made this statement.<BR>     Firstly, &quot;Highway Star&quot; is a grab-your-attention explosion that grips you from beginning to end.  &quot;Child in Time,&quot; on the other hand, is like the slow build-up of magma before the volcanic explosive ending.  &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; is what it is - one of the best and most imitated songs of all time.  &quot;The Mule&quot; showcases Paice's unbelievable drumming capabilities.  &quot;Strange Kind of Woman&quot; begins great, but I could do without Gillan's whooping at the end of the song; it goes on for about 3 minutes too long.  &quot;Lazy&quot; is an example of Blackmore's spontaneity.  &quot;Space Truckin'&quot; is, however, the premier song on the album.  Twenty minutes of interaction between Lord and Blackmore is mind-blowing.<BR>     Finding this album was like discovering a rare gem for me.  The musicians are all on top of their game.  Ian Gillan is the top vocalist from that era.  Blackmore is intense and intensly creative.  All of them give their best.  If you have never listened to Deep Purple before, this is the album to introduce yourself to them.  That's how I did it.
B00005JLRT|3.0|I've heard it said that Nemesis was the last of the Next Generation movies (but how many last star trek movies had shatner..). It's a weak ending. The problem is a writer who hasn't written much and a director who is unfamiliar with the franchise and has little experience directing (though a lot of good editing jobs). It's an interesting story that centers around Picard and Data. Riker gets a good action sequence. Troi has a decent role. As does Jordi. But Worf was just overlooked in this film. They touched on all the different series in one way or another. I know that the Star Trek franchise won't end, even if it isn't the Next Generation cast anymore. I just hope that they can make movies better than this one. It's ok, but really only if you are already a fan.
B00005JLXE|1.0|Daredevil is the most staggeringly awful movie I have seen in a very, very long time.  And I saw Crossroads . (please don't ask why)  I'll spare you the fan-boy rhetoric about how it did not live up to the comic and all that and get right to it.  Every single aspect of this film is tragic.  The direction was such that one might believe Mark Steven Johnson is himself blind.  The acting was laughable, with the exception of Colin Farrel, and the see-gee-eye was par at best.  But what really struck me was the writing.  I once met a rabid squirrel with seven different brain disorders who could have put together a better story than this.  And the dialogue had to have been written by a handicapable third grader.  It had to.  There is no excuse for this movie.  If you haven't already made the mistake, please do not see it.  Please.  Just run, man.  Run far and run fast.  And, if, while you're running, you see Mark Steven Johnson, smack him for me.  Trust me, he deserves it.
B000096I9G|5.0|Amazing sound quality, along with near perfection in video.  The records that make up the Trilogy have always been my personal favorites.  Angst, depression, and anger have never sounded so up-lifting.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Brilliant? A masterpiece? Amazing? Those words don't do this movie justice. Not only is this the best anime ever made but also the best cartoon ever made and one of the best films period. When I heard about how wonderful this movie was I was skeptical because I've seen some jaw dropping animes before such as &quot;Akira&quot;, &quot;Metropolis&quot;, &quot;Grave of the Firefiles&quot; and &quot;Perfect Blue&quot; but when I saw &quot;Spirited Away&quot; it was like I was seeing for the first time in my life. No matter what you hear about this movie nothing can prepare you for what you're about to see. It's like Miyazaki's head opened up and all of his imagination just spilled on to film. This is the &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; of animation. The best word to describe this movie is &quot;Wow!&quot;
B00004WLXZ|5.0|The &quot;narration&quot; which you claim &quot;ruins&quot; the DVD Special Edition of Triumph of the Will is, in fact, an OPTIONAL audio commentary by historian Dr. Anthony R. Santoro, and guess what? YOU CAN CHOOSE NOT TO LISTEN TO IT IF YOU PREFER. Please check your DVD player's instructions on the various audio options available to you. The movie's standard audio format does not have Dr. Santoro's commentary track on it.<br />So, you need not worry -- this DVD edition will not be ruined for anyone. I suspect you simply are not familiar with DVD audio commentaries and your player's audio setup.
0060512806|4.0|Heavy going in places (hint: skip the maths bits if you find them a bit tricky, because they don't add a lot to the story) but fundamentally absorbing and entertaining. Not quite a masterpiece, but a class effort nonetheless.
B00005JLWL|5.0|This movie was absolutely amazing. The Story line was great and original. The action sequences were fast paced and downright AMAZING. I especially liked how they didnt try to rip off the matrix like most movies. There shouldnt even be a question whether or not you should see this movie. Everyone who loves action and new plots should own this. Acting was great as well.
0060934700|3.0|Everything in here that could be considered, by a logical and well-read person, to be a short story, is excellent. Everything that is not (the &quot;poetry&quot;, the vignettes, the various scratchings, the &quot;experimental&quot; stuff) is utter garbage. Pick your way through it with discretion. Nobody questions Gaiman's ability as a writer, but here he seems better suited to the sort of stuff that has a cohesive beginning, middle, and end. The nebulous, airy-fairy pieces are best skimmed past. A solid introduction to Gaiman's work, though, if that's what you're after.
6305014140|2.0|The film takes an odd start, with almost careless direction, but this is soon forgotten once the story line begins to kick in, and it begins to draw you into the plot. If you can stand the stupid amounts of violence and small amounts of sex scenes then you'll be drawn in far more. The characters are hard to get to know in a way because of the dubbing which of course falls below anyone's standards. But this is completely bareable, and you won't take note once the film has got going.<br />If you've seen some of the bigger Manga/Anime productions, then you'll notice the quality of the drawings aren't up to the usual high standard, with less detail involved, but thats as far as Anime goes. Compared to most western animations and drawings, these images are outstanding, and they are by far good enough to enjoy the film.<br />This 2 star film is superb,it may not reach the higher standards of other Anime films, but it's a brialliant little package in it's own way. I've had to bring it down to two because of everyone else giving crazy scores, slapping 5stars on everything they review, which simply isn't true.<br />If you like Manga, you will love this, if you like animations and cartoons, you'll love this, if you're up for something new and different, you may well love this.
0441003257|2.0|Maybe I'm just in a bad mood, but these two guys were trying way too hard to be Douglas Adams, and it shows. For starters, they fail miserably. Imitation is the best form of flattery but outright plaigarism is illegal. A handful of funny bits but essentially nonsensical. Decent, brain-dead fare for a long train trip, but you'll be throwing it right in the bin once you arrive at your destination. You'd be much better of with a 'Hitchhiker' book.
B00008NRI8|4.0|I didn't go into Two Weeks Notice expecting much, which is probably why I enjoyed it overall. It was pretty funny and frequently amusing, and I liked the characters and how original they were. The concept of this film was fresh and I enjoyed it's small twists and turns. But, in the end, how good can a romantic comedy be?
0151006903|3.0|There's probably a point to this whole sprawling mess of a book, but for the life of me I didn't get it. After such undisputed masterpieces of 'The Name Of The Rose' (one of my top ten favourite books of all time) and that other one about the pendulum and the templars and stuff, you know, the one with Foucault in it, this is a bigger letdown than something that really lets you down a whole lot. I thought 'Island Of The Day Before' was just Eco's experimental diversion into forgetting how to write a decent book, but he appears to have adopted boring as a philosophy for his life, and it shows here, between the covers of this book. Nothing even *happened*. I got to the end and my girlfriend was all &quot;Well, what happened?&quot; and all I could do was sit there, not speaking to her, being very very quiet.
0393057658|5.0|I grew up in Tucson Arizona during the 60's and 70's watching baseball on TV. We didn't have a local team to support, or criticize daily like most of the country. I learned early on that big league ball was more than home runs, and no-hitters. Billy Beane see's what real baseball players on the field see from a General Manager's point of view. He see's the weakness, the strengths, and their hearts and souls. This book more than anything shows you what goes on in the mind of a man whose job is to win games, and do it with as little money as possible. Not worrying about hurt feelings, not worrying how fans will react, just give them the best chance to win everyday. Baseball has become a business in which we reward mediocrity, with a .300 batting average as the high mark, and pitchers with era's 4.25 getting bonuses. Many are paid more than anyone should before they step on the field. This is the only business that happens in. Until owners and fans agree that no one is a super star until they can consistently play at a top level for 5 years, we will always be waiting for the next one hit wonder. The baseball world needs more Billy Beanes in order to survive the next 25 years; the trick will be getting the owners to believe it. This book salutes the stars that never had a chance because of some stat that didn't matter anyway. It shows us how ruthless the business end of the game can really be. Sometimes \\"gut\\" feeling will tell you more than any stat. My gut says this book is for those who really want to see what's coming next.....
0060977493|2.0|The literary equivalent of being soundly thrashed with an olive branch after Sunday services and told to shut up and study your Catechism for the next three hours. I found it impossible to empathise with any of the characters, and all it comes off as is some kind of a ham-fisted, hare-brained attempt at...what? Nobody seems to know, and nothing is resolved. An agonizing, pretentious mess. Do yourself a favour and give this one a miss.
B00004XOWM|4.0|What is with you people giving this record negative reviews. So it's not as good as their first 2 albums. that doesn't mean it is still not a good release. Here is my ratings for all of the tracks:<br />Intro:nothing special. just an opening to the album.<br />Hot Dog:****This song has a lot of attitude. It may use the f*** word a lot. But it is still a very heavy and great song.<br />My Generation:*****This is the first song I heard off this cd and is one of my favorites. Real cool guitar part.<br />Full Nelson:****Third song in a row that is just loaded with attitude. It is a very good, in your face song.<br />My Way:*****One of the hit singles off this cd, and with good reason. It simply kicks @$$. This is one of the best songs this band has ever done. my personal favorite.<br />Rollin' (Air Raid Vehicle):****Another hit single. Not as good as the previous song but a great song for crusin around in your car.<br />Livin' It Up:*****This is my second favorite song on the cd. it contains elements of everything LB have done and turns it into a great song.<br />One:***A really melodic, slower piece. It isn't that bad but can get boring after a while.<br />Getcha Groove On:****A great hip-hop song done with Xzibit. The rhymes on here are just so tight and the production is awesome.<br />Take A Look Around:****the theme from Mission Impossible 2. Another great heavy song with a pretty cool guitar riff<br />It'll Be Ok:***this song is not too strong lyrically but it has amazing sonic consistency that makes the instrumentals rock.<br />Boiler:***Probably my least favorite song on the cd. I just never really got into it and it got kinda boring.<br />Hold On:***Another song i never really got into.<br />Rollin'(Urban Assault Vehicle):****A great hip hop version of a great song. Another one of my favorites.<br />Outro:This is just stupid. some guy talkin' about the band.<br />Overall this is not a bad album. I would reccomend it to any hard rock fan because this is another great LB record.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I never liked her before, but when I bought this album and listened to it for the first time it was awsome!! You have to buy this album. It has 20 songs, and they are all about 3,4,5 or 6 minutes long. The cd is filled to the edge. She keeps it real, co-writes all of her songs (except for 2)and I have listened to this album at least 100 times. No joke. I LOVE IT! DEFINETLY RECOMMENDED!
B00003CXIP|5.0|My mother and I decided to rent this movie after watching the TV show, I Love the 80's. I think it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's basically 4 boys and how they are best friends. They go out on a 2 day adventure to find a dead body, but they uncover some horrible truths about themselfs and their lives. With Corey Feldman and River Phoneix, you cannot go wrong. The movie was humorous and heartbreaking. You laugh and you cry. This is one movie that I will always love, and never mind watching again.
B000007NYS|5.0|In 1988 Lucinda Williams released this eponymous work and revealed the marvelous and diverse singer/songwriter that was lurking to break out.  This is a fabulous reissue with a ton of musical gems added. &quot;Side of the Road&quot; is one of the most lyrically impressive songs she's ever written and it's nice to have two very different takes of it.  The Delta blues tunes are dripping with heat and humid authenticity.  The uptempo country tunes slide right through seamlessly with the all of the others.  It's also interesting to hear the progenitory songs leading to 1998's&quot;Car Wheels on a Gravel Road&quot;, arguably the finest and most cohesive album she's ever done.  A tremendous effort with wonderful variety.
B00003CXAE|5.0|In 1971, writers Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey wrote and composed the music for a musical entitled \\"Grease\\".  It appeared first as an amateur production in Chicago, but eventually went to NYC as both off-Broadway and Broadway productions.  With the musical's Broadway success, Paramount Pictures produced it on film in 1978 under the direction of Randal Kleiser, whose previous directorial experiences had been primarily TV series and made-for-TV films.<br />The story for \\"Grease\\" is simple: in circa 1959, an uprooted teenaged girl from Australia, Sandy Olsson (Olivia Newton-John), meets and has a summer romance with a local American boy, Danny Zuko (John Travolta).  At the end of summer, her family remains in America instead of returning to Australia. She is enrolled in a local public high school, Rydell High School, which just happens to be the same high school that Danny attends.  When she runs into Danny, his persona changes to what his friends expect: cool, uninterested and a practical joker.  Sandy is naturally upset, but she doesn't yet understand the dynamics of his friends, who are in two exclusive cliques, the T-Birds (the guys) and the Pink Ladies (the gals).  One of the Pink Ladies, Frenchy (Didi Conn), befriends Sandy and Sandy gets to spend some time with other Pink Ladies, who include Betty Rizzo (Stockard Channing), Marty Maraschino (Dinah Manoff) and Jan (Jamie Donnelly).  The T-Birds include Kenickie (Jeff Conaway), Doody (Barry Pearl), Sonny (Michael Tucci) and Putzie (Kelly Ward).  The principal of Rydell is Principal McGee (Eve Arden), who is assisted by they bumbling Blanche (Dody Goodman).  Other characters include football coach Calhoun (Sid Caesar), auto-mechanics teacher Mrs. Murdock (Alice Ghostley), Vince Fontaine (Edd Byrnes), Cha Cha DiGregorio (Annette Charles), older malt shop waitress (Ellen Travolta) and a cameo by Frankie Avalon as the Teen Angel.  The musical group Sha Na Na is also featured.<br />Casting for \\"Grease\\" continues to be an issue for many people after 25 years because the average age of the actors who portrayed the Pink Ladies & T-Birds (including Olivia Newton-John) was 28. (The oldest was 34 and the youngest was 20 when it was filmed.)  Of these, Stockard Channing performed best, followed by Didi Conn and Jeff Conaway.  Eve Arden and Dody Goodman work very well together in the film.  The most memorable scenes in the film include Sandy meeting the Pink Ladies & finding Danny, the sleep over, trips to the malt shop, the drive-in, Frenchy's dream, the school dance, the drag race and the carnival.  My ratings (out of 5 stars) for some of the songs in the film include:<br />* \\"Grease\\" (4, sung by Frankie Valli.) Title song.<br />* \\"Summer Nights\\" (4.5, sung by Olivia Newton John & John Travolta.)  On the first day of class.<br />* \\"Look At Me, I'm Sandra Dee\\" (5, sung by Stockard Channing.)  At the sleep over.<br />* \\"Hopelessly Devoted To You\\" (5, sung by Olivia Newton-John.)  At the sleep over.<br />* \\"Sandy\\" (4, sung by John Travolta.)  At the drive-in.<br />* \\"Greased Lightnin'\\" (4, sung by John Travolta & the T-Birds.)  At the high school auto-mechanics shop.<br />* \\"Beauty School Dropout\\" (5, sung by Frankie Avalon.)  Frenchy's dream.<br />* \\"There Are Worse Things I Could Do\\" (5, sung by Stockard Channing.)  At school.<br />* \\"You're The One That I Want\\" (4, sung by Olivia Newton John & John Travolta.)  At the carnival.<br />* \\"We Go Together\\" (4.5, sung by entire cast.)  At the carnival.<br />\\"Grease\\" was never intended to be a serious film.  Instead, it was intended to be a silly, fun and entertaining comedy with rock-n-roll music from the late 1950's.  Overall, I rate \\"Grease\\" with 4.5 (raised to 5) out of 5 stars for its fun music and great entertainment value.  Some problems plagued the release of \\"Grease\\" on DVD, such as the royalties lawsuit filed by Olivia Newton-John in 1998 and the need that Paramount had to blur product signs in the malt shop (which some viewers may find offensive).  The film is not perfect, but it is still a very entertaining and I highly recommend it.<br />Following \\"Grease\\", Randal Kleiser went on to direct the ill-fated 1980 film \\"The Blue Lagoon\\" and Olivia Newton-John starred in the 1980 box-office bomb \\"Xanadu\\".  John Travolta went on to star in the very popular 1980 film \\"Urban Cowboy\\", but his acting career suffered until his role as a mobster in the 1994 film \\"Pulp Fiction\\" revived it.  Olivia Newton-John and Randal Kleiser worked together again on the 1996 film \\"It's My Party\\".film is not perfect, but it is still a very entertaining and I highly recommend it.<br />Following \\"Grease\\", Randal Kleiser went on to direct the ill-fated 1980 film \\"The Blue Lagoon\\" and Olivia Newton-John starred in the 1980 box-office bomb \\"Xanadu\\".

B000092ZYY|1.0|Although this release isn't half as bad as the two latest Radiohead albums, it doesn't represent anything new or goundbreaking. The lead singers voice is particually bad on this album; he constantly sounds as though he is about to cry!!! All the songs blend into each other and it will soon be put on the shelf.... for ever. Stick to their early stuff up to OK Computer to avoid dissapointment. AVOID at all cost.
0345350499|5.0|All I can say is that I am normally not a fan of Aurthur/Camelot stories. The book was loaned to me and my friend kept pestering me to read it. I picked it up and was hooked within 5 minutes! Then as some other reviewers have said, I couldn't put it down!<br />The story is compelling, thought provoking and while you may not like all the characters, you will certainly feel something for them, whether its admiration or hate.<br />I read the book before I saw the &quot;TV Movie&quot; and while the movie was acceptable, the book draws you in, the movie could not.<br />If you have nothing to do but read for a couple of days, READ IT!
0452284392|5.0|Barabasi does a great job with his latest work. If you want to get up to speed in understanding what it means to be 'netCentric' then this book is for you. \\"Linked\\" really shows that one needs to think differently if one wants to transform their organization.  After reading this book, your perspective will be different, and you will be able to capitalize on opportunities once missed - it is absolutely amazing. \\"Linked\\" stimulated me to write a whitepaper \\"Becoming NetCentric\\" linking communities of interests (COI), architectures and ontologies....<br />Thank you very much Albert.
B000096I9G|5.0|I have waited for quite a while for the Cure to put out another video with \\"A Strange Day\\", my all time favorite Cure song.  I loved the version on Live in Orange.  The version on the DVD is not as edgy, but great none the less.<BR>This DVD is awesome.  I have been a Cure fan for 20 years now and have liked or loved all of the releases.  I even liked Robert Smith side project-Blue Sunshine.....<BR>The music sounds great and I cannot get enough of it.  My only regret is not seeing them live myself, but this is as close as I would guess it would be.<BR>\\"Pornography\\", \\"Disentegration\\" and \\"Bloodflowers\\" are definitely a trilogy of albums and make a great flow for the time difference in release dates.  A true Cure fan will not be disappointed.  Would like to see this released as a CD.
B000005H3M|5.0|This is a great, classic record. Every jazz drummer worth their salt knows this record. Why does it feel so good?  - answer: Acoustic bass. When Buddy switched to electric bass, it just didn't swing as much. Some of that depends on the players - for example, the electric bass on the \\"live in Montreal\\" video swings pretty well, I think.<br />Also, the big band bass players had their strings higher off the neck, giving a more percussive sound.<br />No offense to electric bass players! I love em. But, with Buddy's style of playing I think upright sounds better. <br />Likewise, the \\"Live East and West\\" album by Woody Herman has a great, feel, again the acoustic bass (and Ron Zito on drums) gives a great swinging feel.<br />So buy this CD!! You'll love it.
B000021XS0|5.0|Wow... Just... WOW!!!<br />Any person who has not listened to this CD has not LIVED. It is pure brilliance in its complexity, technicality and listenability, and many other characteristic parts which form a sum greater than the whole. This CD first kicked my ass about a year ago. Boy, did my music taste turn upside down.<br />Firstly, I'm going to give 1-ton commendations to the musicians themself. Whoever you think is the best guitarist, drummer or keyboardist in the world are, you're wrong.  These three guys are easily the most talented people at their respective instrument, and songs like Finally Free and The Spirit Carries on merely confirm it. The bass player is also awesome, but for some reason takes a lesser part in this aural bliss. Don't think any less of him, for he is a master of the craft.<br />And the rough amongst the diamond field... the singer. Not to lessen his throne, for he is a great singer irrespective... but he's just not good enough for a band with one foot in the hall of musical legends. Nonetheless, he provides a solid performance. Think no less of him because of this CD.<br />The album.... words of mine cannot convey to you how brilliant this is. It's poetic on so many levels... this was the first album to introduce me to concept albums, and golly was it a good one to start off with. After you have bought it, sing along with the lyrics in the book and unravel the mystery of Metropolis yourself. Oh yes, there is a murder mystery in this CD!! Every song unravels the story a bit more, and it has such amazing cohesion and fluidity. Im not going to bother going into the story now, but know this  I wrote a six page lyrical analysis of it, and that involved no schmoozing about how good the CD was. <br />Nevertheless, the story leaps out at you, and the images are as clear as any book. The music provides so much more than mere words  Overture 1928 and The Dance of Eternity being the most obvious examples of this. The Dance of Eternity is Dream Theaters most complex song to day, including Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence. This is corroborated by the drummer (who has an absolute hell of a time counting). <br />Speaking of the drummer, hes the best in the world. Dont even attempt to argue. While youre busy buying this CD, get Live Scenes From New York  its a concert they did on the album tour. Not only will you be blown away by the faithful reproduction of THIS CD (yep, live) (they improve on it too), but you will be staggered by the stamina of poor Mike Portnoy. He kept the pace up all night. What a corker of a guy.<br />I am compelled to continue rhapsodising about this CD. Ive had it for 9 months easily, and it remains far and away the best CD I have EVER listened to. It satisfies the musician in me. It satisfies the boredom in me. It satisfies absolutely everything in me except hunger, although at some volume levels it has stunted my appetite (thats a good thing, folks). <br />Overall, I cannot give enough recommendation to this album. It's THAT good. If you dont buy it now, or as soon as you can, youre doing yourself an injustice. Music of this quality deserves wings. BIG wings. And it will fly, and captivate you in its pure, unadulterated, untarnished and perfected brilliance.
0385509456|5.0|This is an amazing and highly original book.  The story is told to us by a 15 year old autistic boy.  The way he sees the world is wonderfully illustrated and forced me to wonder if 'normal' people really have a better grasp on reality.  It is curious that the author uses an autistic, who doesn't usually understand emotions, to show us what it feels like to be autistic.<br />This was an entertaining and thoughtful read that I enjoyed and plan on recommending.
B00009APK1|5.0|The LOTR trilogy is the best one ever. The visual effects, the action, its all great. One of the few good book-to-movies. Absolutely brilliant! i give it a A+. A must have!
B000066NW0|5.0|I love this CD! It's unusual that I listen to a CD all the way through after I buy it and actually want to listen to it all the way through again and again every day after that. I usually like a couple of songs, then listen to the rest gradually. She's young and the lyrics show that, but that's what you expect from her point of view. It's fun and a blast to sing along to and although none of her lyrics speak to me in a deep way I really enjoy them. The lyrics do remind me of my teen years though so they may affect younger individuals differently. The music itself is unique in that all the songs don't sound the same and show how talented Avril Lavigne is.  Overall, a fun listen to which you may become addicted!
055357342X|5.0|Everything you've ever heard about Martin is true. He's crafted, hands down, the best modern fantasy series ever. There's really no one even close. He is the heir apparent to Tolkien, and surpassing him in my opinion. There are not words enough to describe how much Martin has completely redefined everything that exists about Fantasy and in fact Fiction, period.<br />Read the rave reviews, read all the critical acclaim from critics who are as blown away as the fans are.<br />There are reviews here that can explain things better than I, I simply needed to add another rave for this incredible work of art know as A Song of Ice and Fire.<br />What's great about the series? Wow, what's not. Martin has by far the best characters, best plot, best dialogue. Above all, his ablilty to be incredibly unpredicable and original is his greatest strength. You will NEVER know where he's going. He NEVER does what you expect. He follows no rules. The good guys don't win, the bad guys usually do. Your favorite characters, and I'm talking MAIN characters will die, with their murderers never being brought to justice. He portrays a frustrating, yet realistic brilliance that will drive you mad, yet at the same time totally consume you.<br />This series is very adult, and very dark... and I mean dark. The suffering and violence and injustice and sadness that takes place in this book is truely heart wrenching. The pure emotional intensity pushes your very threshold of what you can possibly endure as a reader. No other fanasy book will envoke the emotions you will feel during the course of this masterwork of a series. As a word of caution, this series is also extremely graphic sexually and language wise, but not to the point of being gratuitous. Its just a realistic portrayal, and its not always pretty or fair. More often than not it isnt.<br />This book, A Storm of Swords is the darkest book yet. Depressing, painful, and absolutly as engaging as the others. Still, very very dark. Youwill feel emotionally drained after this one... but still craving much more.<br />Let me descibe one thing about Martin's writing style that makes it interesting. Every chapter is told through the point of view of one his chosen \\"point of view characters\\". For instance in this book there are something like 15. Each chapter will say \\"Jon\\" at the beginning, or \\"Daenarys\\", or \\"Tyrion\\". What this does is allow you to see an event through one person's eyes, form your opinions and judgements, then see things through the other person's eyes in the next chapter and totally crush the opionins and judgments you just formed. Really brilliant stuff. You'll never know who is the good guy and who is the bad.. because they don't really exist. Everyone is flawed. One of the hooks is Martin adds and subtracts POV (point of view) characters each book. It's always exiciting to know who you're going to have the opportunity to look into their core being and see their actual feelings and motivations.<br />This book isn't just reccommended, it's required reading. Don't even think, just buy it. I can only congratulate you at the same time as apologize. You will feel the joy, laughter, and horric agony of the 7 Kingdoms. You'll want to write a raving review just like everyone else. I apologize because you will have to wait in agony like other readers as we wait for Martin to write the next installment. He's almost done with book 4 of this 6 book series. It has taken him over 3 years to write book 4. Waiting 3 years+ for the next installment really is torture, which is why I can only offer my apologies in that regard. The time it takes to write his books gives you an idea of the depth and complexity.
0393312836|5.0|One of the most unforgettable novels I've ever read. Anthony Burgess' predictions of the future (written in 1962) have not come far from the truth. This novel is a disturbing reflection on the basic structure of our society, on our government and on what it means to be good and evil. In a world where science has the power to turn flawed human beings into perfect machines, one must wonder whether it is moral to turn  sadistic individuals into a good doing robots for the sake of preventing crime.   <BR>Those of you who have seen Kubrick's film, read the novel just for the sake of finding out what the title means!<BR>If you do chose to read this book, make sure to read the European version, which contains the 21st chapter. Personally, I found the chapter to be unnecessary and unfitting to the dark tone of the novel. It seemed like a forced happy ending to a very dark story. It almost contradicts all the statements Burgess makes about the human race throughout the book. Nevertheless, I recommend that you read it anyway so you could make up you own mind.

0393057658|5.0|In the interests of full disclosure, I don't even particularly like  baseball.  However, I found this book absolutely fascinating!  While nominally about baseball, Lewis' book is really about how marketplaces place a level of &quot;value&quot; upon goods/skills/individuals/etc.  Understanding how to properly measure something is crucial not only to baseball, but to other areas, such as the social sciences or stockmarket.  Lewis does a great job at making his message (and the world of baseball statistics) accessable to the average reader.  Plus, it is a compelling story!  I can't recommend this book enough!

B00003CXBK|5.0|A fantastic, beautifully done film, Princess Mononoke deserves a spot in your DVD collection. The transfer is very good, the sound adequate, and there is a short, mildly interesting featurette, with comments by the English-speaking actors (Billy Bob Thornton, Billy Crudup, Jada Pinkett Smith) and the Dubbing Director (who states the dominant themes of the film, such as \\"to explore man's relationship with nature\\").<br />The dubbing job is OK, but not great.  However, Minnie Driver did a very good job as Lady Eboshi.<br />Director Hayao Miyazaki (who created the fabulous My Neighbor Totoro, Spirited Away, and Kiki's Delivery Service) has written and directed a film with a suspenseful story, compelling characters, uplifting music, and beautiful artwork, with misty mountains, scenic countrysides with rice paddies, mossy forests with sunlight streaming through the trees, and dramatic battles in the rain.<br />The noble heroes, Prince Ashitaka (from a tribe that was \\"almost wiped out 500 years earlier\\") and Princess Mononoke (brought up by a gigantic white wolf-goddess in the woods), are courageous, virtuous, respectful of the spiritual world, and want to protect nature--against the encroachments of \\"civilization.\\" Some of the other characters are greedy or suspicious, but none are evil. Lady Eboshi, for example, wants to kill the Great Forest Spirit, but eventually sees the error of her ways, and also treats lepers well and purchases the contracts of prostitutes, giving them jobs in the iron-smelting works. Her troops also defend Irontown against the samurai army of a voracious lord.<br />There are a few gory battle scenes and the demons are a bit scary, and you might want younger children to wait until they get a little older to view this film. On the other hand, some of the forest spirits can be quite charming, especially the ones with the revolving, clicking heads.<br />The story can get complicated. There are numerous gods and human characters, but the theme of \\"civilization versus nature\\" is simple. Lady Eboshi wants to cut down the forests and bring more civilization (i.e., mining, industry, agriculture, and towns) to the world. Prince Ashitaka, from an endangered, persecuted people, is a natural ally to the threatened forest spirits. When he is infected by a demon that has possessed a boar god, his quest to cure himself propels him into the battle between the forces of nature and civilization, and he tries to get the humans to co-exist with nature.<br />The great battle between the boar army and the humans (shown in flashback) is majestic and exciting. The boars are bedecked in white war paint and helped by Princess Mononoke and two wolf cub gods. The concluding scenes, with the Great Forest Spirit searching for its head, are done magnificently.<br />This is a film that your family will love, and want to see many times. I recommend it highly.vilization versus nature\\" is simple. Lady Eboshi wants to cut down the forests and bring more civilization (i.e., mining, industry, agriculture, and towns) to the world.

B00006RU5B|5.0|I'll admit, when I heard the first couple of singles from this album I thought it sounded like Chris Cornell singing for Rage Against the Machine.  But if you get past the radio hits, which are still good songs, it sounds like an entirely new band.  Audioslave is proof that older rockers can still be relevent in today's Nu Metal world without selling out.  This album is a masterpiece!
B000063JZQ|4.0|For those of you (like me) who wince at a Roman Polanski production, and grow even more embarrassed when Hugh Hefner's name is attached to a project, let me say that this production is not as raunchy as you might think.  The parts that might strike a person of refined sensibilities as a bit over the top include scenes where the witches are shown burying a severed hand, and where a nude Lady Macbeth washes her hands.  Both the obviously rubber hand and the nudity are totally unnecessary.  The movie would be better without them.  That having been said, nevertheless, this is a powerfully presented version of Macbeth.

B00000K0E5|4.0|Rank 9 of 23. 4.5 stars. My wife and I were excited to learn that the new bond was going to be Pierce Brosnan. We went to the opening here in florida filled with nervous excitement and were blown away. Brosnan and the Goldeneye movie was fantastic! One memorable line is: Boris says: I AM INVINCIBLE!.  Another is:  the bad guy says, \\"why don't you be a good boy and just die.\\"  bond replys -\\"You First\\".<br />Goldeneye, named for the Jamacian estate, is an EM pulse delivered from space.  The russians have it and plan to use it.  Bond goes to Russia to stop them.  This is set in Russia after the fall of the Soviet union.  As is typical for most Bond movies, the sex is subtle, the language OK and no nudity.  Bond has succeeded with good writing, direction, action, a love interest, humor and a real good bad guy.<br />Because this the first Bond movie under new manage, a female M has through out a feminist line in the beginning.  The new manager has gotten over this need in future films.  For example, she accomplishes the same thing in a better way in Die Another Day, by simply having the writers create better female characters.  And they did a great job in that movie.<br />This is still an excellent Bond movie, with only 8 movies ranked better, and a great action movie period, ranked with 4.5 stars.
0385335482|5.0|All three of her books are hilarious.  I absolutely love her humor and they were all such quick reads.  I definitely recommend all three.  <BR>You will laugh hysterically and find that in some ways we are all like Rebecca Bloomwood.  A++++<BR>Terrific read!!!!!!!!!
B00004WEJZ|4.0|Rank 18 of 23.  Apparently, Connery was talked out of retirement again, though this was his last one.  It is a semi-remake of thunderball, my favorite Fleming novel, but adds a cool  unique villain in Fatima Blush.  <br />The whole cast is excellent and deep, trying to make up for the lack of the familiar supporting cast of a bond movie.  I give it 3.5 stars as a movie, but I rank it 18th of 23 bond movies.<br />This is also one of the few bond movies that has a scene I have to FF by when the children are watching due to a simulated sex scene on a boat.
B00008PX8P|5.0|As any Zeppelin fan will tell you, it has always been about one thing with this band - the music.  This dvd spans 10 years of deserved glory and triumph, cluminating in an unbelievable performance at Knebworth, England in 1979 before 400,000 fans.  No to be missed highlights include Immigrant Song, In My Time of Dying (Jimmy on slide!), Nobody's Fault But Mine (Robert on harp!), Trampled Underfoot, Misty Mountain Hop and a truly masterful Achilles Last Stand in which the band gels like warm sunshine and blue sky with storm clouds on the horizon.  If you always wondered what the rest of us have been shouting about for the past 25 + years here's you opportunity to understand why this is the greatest band in history.  Enjoy!
B00000K0EA|4.0|Rank 12th of 23.  A stunning movie that challenges Bond.  Brosnan is just a great James Bond!  It is hard to rank this 12th because it is a great action movie and a great BOND movie.  It is just that there are 11 Bond movies I like even better.<br />Conservatives think the bad guy is modeled after Ted turner and CNN, and liberals think the bad guy is modeled after Rupert Murdock.  Since 92% of journalist, including movie reviewer are liberal, guess what most of the reviewer tell you.<br />Truth is that this bad guy is a combo of the worse of both Murdock and Turner and the movie is great.  Newspapers today do invent news.
B00009ATKS|4.0|Mogwai's lastest album \\"Happy Songs For Happy People\\", like all of Mogwai's albums takes a few lisens to get used to. There of course are some new surprises, Mogwai's last album \\"Rock Action\\" took a new direction and included more singing and melody. This time around there is only one song with singing.This album is mostly instrumental and it is almost as short as Rock Action,which is short in Mogwai(post rock)terms.Which is the only problem that I had with this album, but this is a small problem. Songs like \\"I know you are but what am I\\" shows band member and multi-instrumentalist Barry Burns stepping up to the plate, this helps make the album feel more organic and also helps widened their sonic palette. Stand out tracks are \\"hunted by a freak\\", \\"Kids will be Skeletons\\" and the very awesome \\"Ratts of the Capital\\", previous Mogwai records showcased what they can do with using soft-loud dynamics.This album is a little different but great and a leap forward. This time around it is an easier progression, but still very intense. Still very sad, still very Mogwai....enjoy!

B00005JLPK|4.0|Salma Hayek does an excellent job in this film of portraying Frida Kahlo in this movie.<br />Although it is slow moving at point and it seems that the story line was created by taking random paintings and trying to put them into a storyline is a bit weak. The scene transitions are slow and do not flow that well.<br />Nonetheless it's a movie that deserves attention, because Mexicans artists deserve this attention from the world. <BR>Salma Hayek is passionate and very believable in this role.
B000089RVX|4.0|Well, if we have nu-metal nowadays, the guys from Evanescence would definitely be representatives of the nu-gothic style, the updated genre of the 21st century.<br />The style is important, however more crucial here are the undisputable songwriting talent, and, of course, the vocals. These are what makes the band stand out of the modern rock crowd and shine so bright in the sky of rock stars. And the unique vocals style itself provides the band with a great and successful future, if they only go on with writing the same calibre music.<br />Evanescence really deserves to be nominated a discovery of the year, and be appreciated by the masses, since being and sounding original these days is almost an unreachable goal.
B00001PE4D|5.0|i just saw this movie and it was awesome!!! the wait was definetely worth it. some people might consider this movie offensive but to me it was anything but that. it's very blunt which is one of the reasons i love it.  Ryan (my favorite character), Sarah Michelle, and Reese did a GREAT job acting their roles out.  personally my favorite part of the movie was the end cause of that song bittersweet symphony and it totally took me by surprise. this movie is definetely one of my faves now!
B00005JKLZ|3.0|I really enjoyed watching this film. While it does not use mant of the &quot;little&quot; things that made the novel or original film enjoyable, I found that I could just sit back and enjoy it as a story. Great music, good effects, and some good acting performances; (Guy Pearce did a terrific job) This newest version of The Time Machine will probably dissapoint hard core Wells fans, and those who expect movies to more closely follow the book; but if you just want to spend a couple hours watching a fun story, this is a good one to pick.
B000002AH9|4.0|Billie laid down these performances at age 42, less than two years before her death. Her voice sounds as if she is 70. Whereas Johnny Cash, Ralph Stanley, Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Rosemary Clooney and some others still sounded good in their 60's, Ms. Holiday's voice was pretty much gone by 40. Drug and alcohol abuse and  perhaps tobacco,  and a hard life in spite of being famous, or partly because of it, ravaged her. This is the kind of album that one cringes to hear at first, the voice is so old and raw and frail. I have never been a fan of Billie's, but then I have not been exposed to much of her output from younger days. However, with each listen, this disc gets better. One becomes accustomed to the voice, and begins to appreciate the effort, and phrasing, and emotion, and courage she put into it. The Ray Ellis arrangements and orchestral accompaniment contribute hugely to the album's success. This is not a disc you play for other people, or when you are in a good mood. Like Sinatra's \\"In the Wee Small Hours\\" it is melancholy, late-night consolation when \\"lonesome\\" and \\"sad\\" are the dominant moods of your life. But every adult has nights like that, and every music collection should have something that fits. If you are lucky, once you hear this a few times to get over the strangeness I spoke of earlier, you'll never need it again...but if you do, it will comfort you. Billie's life was worse than yours, her pain was deeper than yours, her future more limited than yours, her story more poignant and tragic than yours. Keep that in mind as you listen for 45 minutes or so, and you'll end up being blessed by Billie, in her last great studio session.
B000092ZYX|5.0|As it goes with lots of music/movies/books/art/etc. People can be mediocre about a lot of things, but it's hard to be mediocre about Radiohead. I, for one, love Radiohead. I love all of their albums to date. The evolution of their music from Pablo Honey to Hail to the Thief is outstanding. This album, in a way, seems like it should have gone in between OK and Kid A, but at the same time I am so glad it didn't because then I couldn't have looked forward to it. This is tied for second place with OK, because let's face it: the Bends absolutely rocks.<BR>I can't make you love it, like it, or even tolerate it, but the least you can do is give it a chance.
0767817478|2.0|If you enjoy the somewhat generic giant monster movies from the 1950s, you might find something here to like. There is very little character development. It's more like the people exist, but we have no reason to really care about what happens to them. Because of this, the action scenes don't have the tension they could. There are some decent humorous moments. All of the Emmerich/Devlin productions are like this - somewhat empty but looks nice on the big screen. (Yes, I'm knocking Independence Day too.) <br />I was truly annoyed the first time I saw this in the theater. Not because of the changes. Images of this version of Godzilla had been leaked and appeared in G-Fan magazine. The producers said the image was not the Godzilla from the movie. When the movie was finally released, only the coloring was different. Some fans felt they were lied to even though technically we weren't because of the coloring differences. That got to me some. I was a little more objective on my second viewing. <br />TriStar changes the Godzilla legend. The original Godzilla was a metaphor for the Americans' bombing of Japan - an unstoppable force. The producers of the original got the idea after seeing all of the victims of the blast. Here, Godzilla gets mutated from a different scource - not American nuclear testing which was also established in other Godzilla movies such as Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah (1991). However, the newer Japanese films at least acknowledge this one. In Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah: Giant Monster All Out Attack!! (2001), it does make reference to a monster appearing in New York, but the Japanese military doesn't think it was a Godzilla. TriStar's Godzilla is also defeated too easily - despite it's wonderful agility. <br />Although the Godzilla CGI is nice, I don't feel the shading always matches the surrounding set - making the overall effect less impressive. There are also times when the monster may not be lined up properly such as the smaller baby Godzillas chasing humans.  <br />Among the extras, I have always loved the first teaser for this movie - the one that takes place in the museum. There are also original Japanese trailers for Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah (1991) and Godzilla vs. Mothra (1992). Surprisingly, these trailers are in Japanese with subtitles when TriStar doesn't offer them that way in any video format. <br />As a giant monster movie, TriStar's Godzilla is OK but not great. It's not easy for me to recommend this one expect to true, die-hard fans of giant monster movies. I truly wish TriStar had stuck with Jan de Bont's version before scrapping it for the Emmerich/Devlin version.
B000002UAF|4.0|I got this DVD as my birthday present last year, and this is a great, fun film showing the Beatles as they were at the height of Beatlemania. It's great fun with that wonderful music from the Fab Four that we know and love! All of the extras are wonderful reminisces on the making of the film. (Another great DVD to have is the companion video \\"You Can't Do That: The Making of A Hard Day's Night\\" - okay, shameless plug!) Enjoy! :)
0920668372|5.0|I cry everytime I read this to my daughters. An amazing book.
B000084T18|2.0|This album is way to overhyped! 50's being called as good as tupac and rakim, he doesn't even touch those guys. It makes me sick, that he can be even compared to them. See 50 as what he is, an average rapper with an incredible producer (Dr. Dre). The beats are solid and pretty good though they aren't Dre's best work. (take a look at the original chronic or snoops doggystyle album for that)This cd is not worth buying. Just burn a copy from a friend i'm sure one of your friends has it. Personally i like more intelligent MC's like Nas, 2Pac, Aesop Rock, Atmosphere, or even some De La Soul and Tribe and i love Outkast. All of those artists have albums that blow 50 outta the water. What has rap come to when albums like this go 6 times platinum, i mean honestly, back in the the 90's when Pac, Biggie, Wu-tang, and Nas were in their prime a record like this wouldn't of gone platinum. Bottom line- just burn a copy! This guy doesn't deserve any more recognition he's just an average MC.
B000008LOV|5.0|Ironically, it may be because they are not setting their sights especially high that this album proves to be one of the only supergroup collaborations that was NOT a disappointment.  Not to say that the songs on here are simple or basic, because they are not.  The album just sounds like a bunch of very good singer-songwriters getting together and doing what they do best - write and perform rock songs.  <br />Highlights of the album for me are the Dylan tracks, specifically &quot;Tweeter and the Monkeyman,&quot; &quot;Congratulations&quot; and a couple others.  But it really was a group effort - Harrison probably has the biggest chunk of singing, and Petty figures in prominently on certain tracks, but overall each member has their chance to shine.  Roy Orbison's unmistakable, pitch-perfect vocals brighten tracks such as &quot;Not Alone Anymore.&quot;  Perhaps the most enjoyable moments on the CD are when the members frequently trade off vocals on a single track, such as 2 of the albums catchiest tunes, &quot;Handle Me With Care&quot; and &quot;End of the Line.&quot;<br />5 stars - should be required listening for fans of any of the Wilburys.
B000002LND|5.0|I AM A BIG FAN OF MADONNA,I OWN THIS CD AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT  IS OK FOR AN OCASSINAL FAN,MOST OF THE SONGS ARE WELL REMIXED BUT EDITED,SOUND IS GREAT,SONG SELECTION VERY FINE,INCLUDES TWO TRACKS NOT AVAILABLE IN OTHER ALBUMS &quot;JUSTIFY MY LOVE&quot; AND &quot;RESCUE ME&quot;,&quot;VOGUE&quot; AND &quot;CHERISH&quot; SOUND GREAT,ANYWAY THIS IS A CLASSIC GREATEST HITS ALREADY.FROM THE FIRST TO THE LAST TRACK HITS ONLY.
B00005JL3A|3.0|Ok I am a huge Resident Evil fan.... I have all of them except RE:Gaiden and RE:Survivor...(survivor I hear sucked)...<br />If you are a huge Resident Evil fan this may not make you very satisified.... The reason why is because only certain parts of the game are in it. For instance, Zombies, The T-Virus, Umbrella Corporation, and a small scene of Raccoon City, oh and the Licker from Resident Evil 2. But see, just because they have all these things doesn't mean that it's going to be as great as playing the game because the movie really is just like playing the game because all you do is walk around this place called \\"The Hive\\" and try to disable the Red Queen. Now what would've been VERY smart is if they would've had Stars Alpha team be the people who investigated because the other people worked for Umbrella, which kind of made me angry because I hate the Umbrella in the game! They make me so mad with all those lies but hey it's just a game... Ok now here are the facts..<br />PROS:<br />Very nice Commentary w/ Milla Jovoich (Actor), Michelle Rodriguez(Actor) , Paul Anderson (Director), Jeremy Bolt (Head Producer).<br />Very good acting, I personally liked Milla Jovoich's kicks and moves, she's good!<br />Enough Action to satisfy anyone... Lots of Zombies<br />CONS:<br />The parts of the game they put in here are not very well designed, for instance, The Licker. The Licker is the weird bizarre creature we find in Resident Evil 2 on the ceiling of a Police Station in Raccoon City. Well see the thing is that this Licker design in the movie is not completely a clone of the one from the game, so it's not quite like The Licker you'll see in RE:2.<br />Not well Budgeted..... This movie was not well budgeted and here is why... When you see that lady in the elevator about to get her head chopped off after the T-Virus is released, why don't they show the head get chopped off? LOL Michelle Rodriguez complains about that on the commentary. This movie is Rated R so why can't theyshow that much gore? Paul Anderson (director) said that the movie had insufficient funds to possibly make gore and stuff. So that was lame. Also Michelle never got to use her knife, and it was because they didn't have enough time or money to show zombie guts getting taken out.<br />The Ending was terrible.... WHAT THE HECK HAPPENS! THATS SO ANNOYING YOU CAN'T JUST GET AWAY WITH THAT! The ending leaves you wondering if Matt turns into Nemesis cause that doctor says \\"I want him in the Nemesis program\\". And where is Jill Valentine? Where is Brad Vickers? I will give them credit on one condition.... IF THEY PUT JILL VALENTINE IN THERE! WHAT THE HECK WILL HAPPEN BECAUSE IN RESIDENT EVIL 3 THE CITY IS NUKED AT THE END! So how could Alice (milla jovoich) possibly get out of Raccoon City? Thats gonna be an outrage if they do not put something about Jill Valentine on there. Also they MUST have Nemesis! They must because he was part of the story!<br />Final Point: This movie is good but not great.... The story line isn't good enough.... But lemme tell you the commentary is great, one of the first I've been happy to hear. So good bye yalls and thanks for reading
0451191153|4.0|I enjoyed and related well to this novel.It's core is meant to shake up the existing conditions of a set society and bring about change. We can apply this more fictionalized world to our own, and Rand employs a lenghty technique to achieve just that. Ultimatley you have to decide for yourself whether you hate or love this novel(there is little margin to qualify),and that I believe is the sign of a great piece of work, either way it will evoke something in you, controversial or not.I recommend it to those who enjoy a little philosophy in their sex and politics.
B00008OWZC|4.0|How The West Was Won is a companion piece to Led Zeppelins self-titled dvd.  While the dvd explores the bands entire career on stage, the cd focuses on just two performances from two California shows at the Los Angeles Forum & Long Beach Arena in 1972.  There are some powerhouse versions of songs like Black Dog, Dancing Days, The Ocean and Over The Hills and Far Away.  But some of the songs seem a little stagnant especially the acoustic based number Going To California and surprisingly Stairway To Heaven which doesnt convey the power of the album version.  Dazed and Confused is deep and powerful and never loses its grip on you over its twenty-five minutes, but the twenty-three minutes of Whole Lotta Love, which is infused with some 50s rock covers, negates the power and fury of its mammoth guitar riffs.  Moby Dick is still a wild John Bonham workout, but after seeing the manic ferocity in which he attacks his drum kit from an earlier show in England on the dvd, it loses some of its intensity.  These are just minor quibbles, but overall, this generous three-disk collection shows off the prowess of the legendary group and captures them in a perfect snapshot of when they were at the peak of the rock mountain.
B000058TDY|5.0|I think Back to Earth is his best album. It's definately my favourite. It has recaptuerd that simpleness and rawness that primed his Glory days of Teaser and the Firecat and Tea for the Tillerman and fused it to the beautifulness of albums like Buddha and the Chocolate box. Not that Tea and Teaser weren't beautiful, but they didn't have the cute sounds and very happy melodies of Izitso and Buddha. The arrangements aren't synthesiser laden but simple, just Piano [or synthesiser], strings, bass guitar and vocals. If you liked Sad LIsa and Silent Sunlight, this ones for you. But this arrangement has more \\"loveliness\\" to it than the Acoutic guitar. It's not really superior. THe acoustic guitar also shows it's head on \\"Just another night\\" and \\"Daytime\\" which are fan favourites that harken back. Songs like Daytime, Father, The Artist, last love song and Randy are vocal classical music. The melodies on these songs are exquisit. Checkout the piano fianle to The Artist. Randy must be one of the rawest love songs he's done, it doesn't seem to make sense or go anywhere but is full of feeling and atmosphere. It explores many styles from rock, classical and pop. Last love song is similar but is sadder. His piano playing reminds me of someone [beautiful woman perhaps?] slowly walking along a beach. The string section on Father is so beautiful and touching , along with the lyrics about his presumably deceased Father. Daytime is great poetry and has some fantastic orchestration. But hang on, Nasimento is a dreamy disco number btu still has some beauty to it. Bad Brakes is a bad boy blues number, reminds me of Billy Joel's Glass Houses with lyrics that could've been written by ZZ Top [actually written by Alun Davies and Cat]. New York times is like something from the Izitso album but with less experimentation. So there is good variety. Buy it and enjoy it, that is all I can say.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead's Hail To The Thief has been hailed as a return to a more straightforward sound than their previous two albums, Kid A &amp; Amnesiac.  While the songs are more structured, the band hasn't abandoned the experimental sounds of those albums.  Radiohead has always been a political band and never more so than on this album.  The album's title is a not so thinly veiled reference to the 2000 US Presidential Elections and lead Thom Yorke is a vocal opponent of the US &amp; England's involvement in Iraq.  The album has a political edge with songs like the opening \\"2+2=5\\", \\"Sit Down, Stand Up\\", \\"Scatterbrain\\", \\"A Wolf At The Door\\" and \\"The Gloaming\\" exude a paranoid view of politicians as Big Brother and the control they exert over society.  The band tempers the paranoia with the most melodic album they've released.  The songs have some extremely catchy and inviting melodies amid the electronic overlays.  \\"There There\\" is a richly textured and gorgeous song.  \\"A Punch-Up At A Wedding\\" is song about a dysfunctional family that is set to a soul groove and Mr. Yorke perfectly captures the hurt and anger the moments in the song play out over some hauntingly beautiful piano work.  \\"Myxomatosis\\" is probably the first song ever sung from the point of view of a diseased cat, but it is a strangely effective and powerful song.  Hail To The Thief finds Radiohead pulling the magical trick of expanding the boundaries of their musical horizons without alienating their past.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I've been wanting to see this movie for so long and I finally got it! Spirited Away is sooo unbelievably amazing! The storyline is terrific and the animation is spectacular. Miyazaki intended for this film to be aimed towards young girls, but people of all ages and gender will surely fall in love with it.<br />This movie is about a girl named Chihiro. She and her parents have just moved, and the story starts as the family is driving to their new home. However, Chihiro's father has taken a wrong turn and they up near this tunnel. Of course, they go through the tunnel and end up in this place. Little does she know, this is where Chihiro will experience the greatest adventure of her life. She will grow tremendously, from that little whiny girl to a courageous young woman.<br />I highly recommend this movie to absolutely anyone. So go out and buy it!
B000002H8F|5.0|simply amazing.  sure it isn't as immensly intense as sufer rosa or doolitle, but it's impossible to say this doesn't do the job.  people can say what they want about how this cd isn't as &quot;hardcore punk&quot; as their other ones.  but people don't see how their other cd's are just like this one, just wiht a rougher sound.  all their songs are beautiful and melodic and if u listen to all of them enough times you can see they are the same.  all the songs on this album are great from beginning to end.  in my opinion, hangwire, havalina, velouria, and the happening are the best songs. nothing can compare to frank black talking for 2 minutes behind kim deal's singing in the happening.  to fully understand the pixies you have to buy this cd to go along with doolitle and surfer rosa and trompe le monde cuz they all seem to make sense together.  if your into the pixies and that kind of music, you definately need to buy the cd and if your not, dont buy it cuz you won't understand it.
0671027387|5.0|This is a fast paced unpredictable great book.  I never expected what would happen next and it took me no time to read this book since you can't put it down.  I would reccommend this to anyone.  And don't listen to the person who gave it 1 star.  He said he only read the first 5 pages.  How can you rate a 500 page book by the first 5 pages?  And the book isn't even that politacal.  It is very action adventure which that person would have seen had they read the book before writing a review.
B00006IUL6|4.0|Allthough a lot of people avoided this film in the movie theaters (myself included) because of the rather dodgy choice of the casting Robin Williams as a killer, it appears that these fears were totally unjustified.<BR>   Insomnia is a film that contributes nicely to a genre desperate gor oxygen, that of the old and classic \\"dtetective film\\".<BR>   It works because it incorporates several interesting angles to keep you interested throughout as well as guessing.<BR>   An Alaskan town as the setting for a murder case where an L.A detective is brought in? Nice touch.<BR>   A killer not played by the usual baddies but by \\"Ms Doubtfire\\"-Robin Williams? Better touch even.<BR>   A detective who cant seem to get any sleep under the never setting sun in Alaska even if his life depended on it? Good, really good.<BR>  It's mainly those 3 axes that fuel the engine of this story and, of course, the superb acting of Pacino and even Williams who settles in his killer role incredibly convincingly. It wouldnt matter, in fact, how Pacino came across here had Williams not fit in with his role. The whole thing would've collapsed in ruins. <br />   But that's exactly it, Williams plays the loser-small-time-author-turned-killer perfectly and from there on it's a smooth ride all the way to the end.<BR>   This is a film by dierctor Chritopher Nolan who filmed Memento and if u thought that Memento avoided any cliches so does Insomnia. Insomnia HAD to avoid the cliches because ths is genre that has gone stale exactly because it rode the cliches for far too long. <BR>   Pacino's character is one that grows edgier every 5 minutes the film progresses no doubt NOT helped by his lack of sleep. He's also a character that has a lot on the line as he's been sent to Alaska because of internal tension in his department and because he's got a great reputation to protect.<BR>   That reputation takes a huge dent as he winds up killing his partner in the case (by mistake? not? not sure) and this becomes the killer's leverage point in a way that provides for numerous twists.<BR>   Williams's character is one that has become a murderer \\"because it happened\\" and he seems to have great adjustability potentials as he slips into his role like a snake would around its victim. Being the cornered animal since it's not going to be easy to remain unknown for long in the small Alaskan town environs he decides to turn this into a poker affair with the cop. As Pacino seems to either overtrust or simoultaneously underestimate his opponent the twists become weirder and better.<BR>   <BR>    Much to the director's credit there's no clear-cut happy end.Had there been it would a classic case of the film that does well or great until the last 30 seconds when it all turns silly. Not the case here, the end is tense, believable, plausible and has the showdown touch the whole story has been yearning for.<BR>    Refreshing and excellently filmed it reminded me how much i've missed good detective story-films.
B000075BFK|4.0|Tupac has always been the greatest rapper ever and it shows it even more with his latest album &quot;Better Dayz&quot;.Every song on this album is great and yea you have people that say they dont like this album because its a remastered album.If you are a true Tupac fan like I am then you should buy this album and you would not be wastin your money because every song is worth it.Even tho that &quot;All Eyez On Me&quot; is my favorite 2pac album,&quot;Better Dayz&quot; falls right underneath it.
B000002GQE|5.0|Having started out in 1965 as a rhythm &amp; blues combo, and having scored one hit single, &quot;Go Now,&quot; the Moody Blues suddenly found their initial fame on the wane. Their second album, &quot;The Magnificent Moodies,&quot; sold poorly &amp; yielded no hits. Singer/guitarist Denny Laine (later to join Paul McCartney in Wings) &amp; bassist Clint Warwick saw the writing on the wall and left the band. But the remaining members, vocalist/flautist Ray Thomas, keyboardist Mike Pinder &amp; drummer Graeme Edge weren't ready to close shop on the band just yet. They recruited new singer/guitarist Justin Hayward and singer/bassist John Lodge, and the decision was made for the band to change musical direction. Impressed by the band's new demos, their record label, Decca, asked the Moodies to record a demonstration album of the label's new Deramic Sound System, which would splice together the Moodies' new songs with Dvorak's &quot;New World Symphony&quot; performed by an orchestra. But the Moodies had other ideas---and a brand-new, vital instrument called the mellotron that Pinder would expertly incorporate---and, with conductor Peter Knight leading the London Festival Orchestra &amp; scoring the orchestral bridges between the band's songs, the Dvorak recording was scrapped altogether, and the Moody Blues delivered &quot;Days Of Future Passed&quot; instead.This classic 1967 album is an undisputed landmark, both for the Moody Blues AND for rock music in general. One of the very first recorded marriages between rock &amp; classical (along with Procol Harum's &quot;A Whiter Shade Of Pale&quot; and some parts of the Beatles' &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;), &quot;Days Of Future Passed&quot; helped open the gates for the progressive-rock movement that would soon follow, and it also was one of rock's very first &quot;concept&quot; albums. Though certainly not telling a story, per se, the Moodies chose a simple but very effective theme for the album: the passing of a day, with eachsong representing each portion of the day, from dawn (&quot;Dawn Is A Feeling&quot;), to noon (&quot;Peak Hour&quot;), to night (the immortal classic &quot;Nights In White Satin&quot;). The Moodies' work on this album is simply astonishing: the harmonies, the writing &amp; arrangements, the band's superb playing &amp; singing, Graeme Edge's exquisite poetry at the beginning and end of the disc, Peter Knight's lovely orchestral flourishes that compliment the band's compositions so well, and just the sheer *beauty* of the music as a whole. It's &quot;classical rock&quot; of the highest order, often imitated by others (Deep Purple, The Nice, Rick Wakeman, etc.), but never duplicated in quality. In between the beautiful orchestrations by Peter Knight, the Moodies contribute one gorgeous song after another: Pinder's masterful &quot;Dawn Is A Feeling&quot; (mostly sung by Justin, with Mike singing the bridge), Ray's bouncy &quot;Another Morning,&quot; John's rollicking &quot;Peak Hour,&quot; Justin's whimsical classic &quot;Tuesday Afternoon&quot; (still performed in concert to this day), John's lovely &quot;(Evening) Time To Get Away,&quot; Pinder's Arabic-tinged &quot;The Sunset,&quot; Thomas' harmonic &quot;Twilight Time,&quot; and finally, the immortal, absolutely timeless grand finale, Justin's legendary &quot;Nights In White Satin,&quot; the Moodies' signature song, permanent concert staple, and one of the most treasured (and covered) ballads in all of rock. From the first orchestral fade-in, to the classic final crashing of the gong (delivered by Mike Pinder himself), &quot;Days Of Future Passed&quot; is a Moody Blues masterwork, a timeless disc, and is a 100% must-own album for your collection.
B00000IQW3|5.0|Ok, havne't read anyone's review before writing this so I'm going to just assume someone overviewed the plot.  <br />I grew up around the time this came out.  It was something that basically the whole family could watch yet not be bored watching it.  <br />Now that I'm older and seeing it anew via dvd I have one interesting notation.  Unlike many other non-starwars/startrek sci fi space movies, this one hasn't degraded with time.  The space fights are still cool and the plot still relavant today.  It's a good solid story that I believe will stand the test clear through to my children's generation.
B000056HUA|5.0|This was a great vinyl album and a great CD, but this classic is absolutely fantastic in 5.1 DVD-A advanced resolution. Instrument separation, crystal-clear vocals, deep base...it's all here, folks.<br />After a few beers, I thought I heard Morrison casually breathing into the mic after the chorus of LA Woman during one of the instrumental solos...<br />I've bought about 30 DVD Audio disks so far. The recording quality of this one is in the top five. People interested in buying this have likely already heard the album, so there is no need to comment on the brilliance of the lyrics and music content.<br />If you don't have DVD Audio yet, you are really missing out. Also, if you are not DVD-A ready - DON&quot;T BUY THIS DISK. YOU ARE WASTING YOUR MONEY.

B00005JKG9|2.0|Unlike most of the reviewers here and on IMDB, I didn't like it.   To me, the acting seemed contrived.    I have been in places that operated like this (luckily I was a consultant, not actually working for the company) and I have seen what the actors here attempted to portray firsthand.   I think they did their best but it did not 'feel' like the real thing to me.   Baldwin's famous speech seemed so scripted to me, the words are right, but the way it was delivered seemed too fake.

B000002UB3|5.0|There has been much heated debate to which album deserves to be labeled as the best album done by The Beatles. It is a very difficult decision, as much of The Beatles' catalog is spectacular. But in terms of musicianship, spirit, artistry, and polished finesse, &quot;Abbey Road&quot; towers above all the others.<br />The most magical aspect of &quot;Abbey Road&quot; is the fact that each member of the band contributed their greatest efforts to the final album. There is not a single weak track here, and the album flows with artistic cohesiveness that is more fluid, focused, and tangible than &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. Why people choose that album over &quot;Abbey Road&quot; is beyond me.<br />While some of the other Beatles albums may have throwaways or fillers, &quot;Abbey Road&quot; sounds complete. Song after song, it's one gigantic sing-along. Every track is melodic, and the variety of the music is spellbinding. You can tell all the Beatle members put their hearts and souls into making this product. And as the final musical statement, &quot;Abbey Road&quot; closes with a medley that finds The Beatles journeying through a series of one/two minute melodies until it culminates in the explosion of the &quot;The End&quot; track. The effect is unmatched in all of rock.<br />From &quot;Please Please Me&quot; all the way to &quot;Abbey Road&quot; was one long illustrious adventure, and The Beatles topped it off majestically.

The star of the movie is Elinor...a 1967 Shelby Mustang GT 500 which happens to be the last car that they must steal.  If you're a car fan, this would be the movie for you.
B0000560X3|4.0|This is the classic Deep Purple release that we all remember. But this time they truly remastered it - in 5.1 surround sound! The production is top-notch all the way. If you are worried about a sub-par DVD-Audio experience with &quot;Machine Head,&quot; then put your fears to rest. The sound engineers give you your money's worth with this one. Very good sound.<br />Not a lot of extras with this one: One bonus track and a two-song video playlist.<br />&quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; at high volume in advanced resolution will change your musical world forever.<br />Highly recommended.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I thought that this movie was great! I can't believe that so many people hated this movie! I thought that the acting and special effects were great! The cast was strong, and each actor portrayed their character wonderfully. The love story was the love triangle that everyone complains about, but it was classic and touching. For all of the people out there who only liked the 30 minute attack scene... did you really expect that the whole movie was going to be like that?? I personally think that Michael Bay did a great job recreating that devestating day and the events after it. This movie definately deserves 5 stars!!
B0000028UK|5.0|I don't see whats so great about TEN, don't get me wrong it's a good album.  In my opinion Vs. is TEN times better.  It sold 950,000 copies its first week of release, it was more punkish and had a better sound to it as well.  My personal favorite song on the cd is Glorified G and I think its there best song PJ ever made...why? cuz of its kick a$$ solo at the end!  Theres also other great tracks such as the opener GO which is probably the best opener for any Pearl Jam cd ever!  Then there is Animal, Daughter, Dissident, Rearviewmirror, Rats, &amp; Eldery Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town.  If you don't have this cd in your collection then you are missing out cuz this is pearl jams best work. TEN was a great album but it was 2 overrated and didn't have all the great songs that Vs had.
B000058T5E|5.0|In an age where the electric guitar has been simmered to three-chord strum buckets of tedious pop and sterile noise, guitar god Jeff Beck pushes the boundaries of the instrument while still showing who's boss. He builds upon the astral, robotic coolness of &quot;Who Else!&quot; by putting on a display of ferocious attack and pyrotechnical aggression with &quot;You Had It Coming&quot;.<br />The album contains in-your-face, acid-spitting, fire-breathing licks, all coming from a Stratocaster. Jeff Beck's tone is completely unmatched. Though rock n' roll purists may be turned off at the album's electronic sound, they will soak up the guitar work and commend the hard-hitting beats as fitting. Turn up your speakers to a guitar that speaks the language of heaven and space, evident in such tracks as &quot;Roy's Toy&quot;, &quot;Dirty Mind&quot;, &quot;Nadia&quot;, and even the humorous and playful &quot;Blackbird&quot;.<br />Jeff Beck adds another winner to the list, which includes his renown classics such as &quot;Blow By Blow&quot; and &quot;Guitar Shop&quot;. Love rock guitar? &quot;You Had It Coming&quot; is head-over-heels ahead of everyone else.
6303168507|5.0|This is one movie that I think everyone at some point must see.  In the peak of the second world war, Oskar Schindler believes he can use a war that takes away millions of lives and a Nazi regime that murders millions of innocents, to make a profit.  He soon begins to see the atrocities for what they really are.  Slowly he begins a list, a list that will save many.
B00008OLYN|2.0|I'm sorry to disagree with the many apparent fans of \\"Damnation\\", but I was sorely disappointed by it. I bought it on a whim after hearing about Opeth through the progressive rock grapevine, with no expectations and an open mind to give it a fair chance. I was first put off by the running time - 43 minutes. That might have been fine in the 1970s, but frankly if I'm going to shell out $18 for 43 minutes of music it had better be The Dark Side of the Moon. Still, I hoped that the music would be worth it, but sadly, while there are some nice moments here, it's just not very original. The songs seem hastily written and are musically uninspired. Stylistically, \\"Damnation\\" sounds like Porcupine Tree minus all the good stuff (vocal harmonies and emotive instrumental passages). As for the technical aspects of the album, I was appalled by the sound quality. The guitars and vocals are high in the mix, while the drums sound like they were recorded in the bathroom across the hall. The Mellotron sounds are horribly synthed, they're so tinny that there's no warmth in the keyboard section at all. My biggest complaint, however, was that I couldn't understand what the singer was saying. Maybe the lyrics to this album are brilliant, but I couldn't tell. It's a shame to have to consult lyric sheets just to understand and enjoy the singing. <br />I listened to this album for two weeks before writing this review, and despite wanting to give it a chance it just didn't grab me. I have to recommend avoiding this album and suggest Porcupine Tree's \\"In Absentia\\" as a superior alternative in this genre.
B00000K0E5|5.0|It had been the longest wait for a Bond movie, 6 years. But in 1995, Pierce Brosnan delivered! Goldeneye is always a fan favorite for it's gripping story, a brand new 007, a new M, exciting villains, beautiful girls, gadgets galore and the sophisticated class of it all. <BR>The story begins in 1986, with 007 and Alec Terevelyan,(006) working together to destory a chemical factory in the Soviet Union. The movie begins with a thrilling ski dive from Bond. The plot to destory the factory goes awry when they are caught by General Ourumov and the Russian soldiers. Trevelyan is captured and killed, (or so it appears to be.) Bond is enraged and makes a daring escape via a motorcycle, driving right off a cliff to catch a moving plane. He does this while being fired at by the Soviets. Bond finally catches the plane and we are sweeped into one of the best main title sequences in years! The movie resumes in 1995, with Bond driving the famous Aston Martin, and meeting the daunting Xenia Onatopp. He meets her again at a local casino, and the two exchange the usual Bond glib remarks. We then discover through a certain scene that Xenia is not what she seems to be and that she kills an officer to take his pass to a helicoptor demonstration the next day. Xenia and Ouromov steal a highly protective helicoptor and take it to northern Russia. They steal a secret space weapon called Goldeneye, that is able to destroy anything with an electronic circuit. They fire it on Severnaya and escape with a computer whiz called Boris. While this is going on, Bond is being briefed by M to get the Goldeneye back. Bond meets a CIA agent called Jack Wade and an old enemy-turned-ally called Valentin Zukovsky. They help him track down the mysterious Janus, who was responsible for the theft of the Goldeneye. Bond finally meets him and discovers him to be Alec Trevelyan, who is angry at Britain for the deaths of his parents. Bond meets Natayla, a beautiful survivor of the Goldeney attack, and they escapefrom capture to hunt down Alec, Xenia and Ourumov. Ourumov is killed on the train/fight sequence. There is also a stunning tank escape. Bond and Natayla go to Cuba, where Alec has another Goldeneye satellite, and plans to steal the money from the bank of England, and then destroy London. Bond kills Xenia and is then caught by Alec. There is a terrific fight between the two, with a deadly cat and mouse hunt. Bond and Alec eventually end up on the actual satellite, and Alec falls to his death. The satellite is destroyed and Bond and Natalya fly off to enjoy some peace. <BR>Goldeneye features a riveting title song by Tina Turner, and the music video is included. A Bond movie documentary and a audio commentary is also present. A behind the scenes feature and theatre previews are also included on the DVD.<BR>Goldeneye is one of the best Bond movies and all 007 fans will enjoy it!
B000067CPX|5.0|THE TRUMPET IS AMAZING!!  ITS A TRUMPET!  NOT A HARMONICA IN THE BACKGROUND!
B00005QIPH|4.0|I don't agree with the assertion some of the other reviewers have been saying about this album, that \\"this is it.\\" Futhermore, they're insinuating that their music is implausible and redundant. It's a bunch of nonsense. They have this notion that the material presented by this original-band, has no merit; and that they're just like every other \\"corporate-rock\\" band out there. Alas, they shouldn't be harping on a bunch of guys with the \\"funny-looking\\" hair, and the funky passe clothing they don before each show. It seems to me like they're saying that this band sucks, and therefore destined to fail. On the contrary: they're the next \\"big-thing.\\" They aren't your typical sounding band. They can be compared to with the likes of: The White Stripes. With the eccentric-personalty of vocalist (lead-singer) Julian Casablancas, with his \\"raspy-timbre\\" belts-out each lyric with an (man, can he scream) honest-effort. With the juxtaposition of the '70's-style grungy-looking clothes, and their \\"Led Zepplinesqe\\" approach to singing - and guitar-playing - it sounds a lot like your listening to Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, with thier \\"elaborate-style\\" of guitar-riffs and the \\"basic-fundamental's\\" of: guitar players, a drummer, and a bassist. It's music in its pure form - unadulterated - without the fancy synthesizers and the cacophony associated with some of the death-metal, hard-rock bands out there. <br />\\"Is This It\\" is the sophmoric-release by this New York, NY based troupe of grunge-rock-tinged music. Allow me to introduce to you, the band members: Vocalist, Julian Casablancas; Nick Valensi is on the Guitar, as is Albert Hammond Jr.; with Nikoli Fraiture as Bassist; and Fab Moretti on the Drums....It's brilliantly produced by: Gordon Raphael. With Ryan Gentles (Wiz Kid) as the Manager; and JP Bowersock as the band's Guru. My salutations goes-out to these guys, who have worked very hard on this album: \\"Thank you, for making good music, and pleasing your fans with these wonderful songs.\\" <br />I discovered their music on a trip to Denver, Colorado, back in August of 2002. What a beautiful state. There're so many things to do Downtown: With lots of neat stores and shopping malls, plenty of nice restaurants to eat at, and tons of cool dance clubs. And did I mention, Coor's Field? It's where you can watch a \\"Colorado Rockies\\" game, in a state-of-the-art ballpark; it's so awesome! Anyway, some girl who was working the night-shift at \\"C.B. & Pott's\\" [Sports Bar] in Westminster (a Denver suburb), had asked me \\"What band is this? They're this new band from N.Y.\\" I'm all, \\"I don't know...they've got a cool-sound about 'em.\\" She's all \\"They're pretty cool, they've got this old '80's-sound to them.\\" She says to me, \\"It's 'The Strokes'\\" - whose music was playing on the jukebox. The song was called \\"Someday.\\" I was instantly-hooked and got thier album. I also heard their song \\"SOMA\\" in a Volkswagon car commerical. They really know how to make good music and to pleasing thier loyal-fans.<br />So get a copy of \\"Is This It\\" today. It comes with a limited-editon DVD, with the music-videos to: Last Night, Hard To Explain, Someday, New York City Cops, and The Modern Age. I give this album ***4-stars*** for the band's sincere-efforts. I hope to see them in concert one-of-these-days.
B00005KARK|5.0|This movie is perfectly fine for Children , I watched this movie before and it does not look like Disney was giving Glory to the Cruel Treatment of animals here but rather it was the other way around &gt; Like when the Ring Master had all those Elephant's standing on top of eachother I don't think Walt Disney was saying it's okay to treat animals this way, I mean did you ever think that it could have only been a joke, its just a cartoon not everything they do needs to be taken serious , also I get the feeling that Walk Disney was against this treatment of animals , like when they locked up Dumbo's Mother it seems like Disney was saying this was a bad thing , to me I think that maybe Disney was trying to say that some of this stuff that goes on in the circus is not good and is cruel &gt; I mean that is the message I get out of  it &gt; I am someone who loves and adores animals so I can understand how manby an animal lover might would be offened , but to me this movie makes animal cruelity out to be bad if anything &gt; No this movie is not racist , just because they have Black people putting up the tent does not make it racist and just because the Black Crows might talk like Black people, I mean it's getting crazy people thinking of almost anything as being racist , like having Black Witches is Racist is just crazy and also if you say that Black Man rather then that Man someone might accuse you of being racist, I mean people really need to take it easy , this stuff is not racist &gt; It just that way it was back then and it not Walk Disney's fault that it was that way back then, so just because they had those Black Men putting up Tents does not make Disney a racist lol , maybe if anything Disney here as well was speaking against racism ? Also so what if the Black Crows sounded like Black People that does not make Disney a racist lol , I mean did not the Black Crows turn out to be good and help Dumbo ? hmmmmmm ? Well then so if they where supposed to be like Black People then Disney was making these certain Black People out to be good and helpful, so if anything Disney was saying that there are a lot of good Black People &gt; Anyways, I have always liked this movie as a Child but never owned it until it this Special Dvd came out &gt; I like the message about this baby Elephant with a so called birth defect being good and coming out a winner , just because he was different other did not like him, even though he was so innocent , to me this movie has wonderful messages and I don't see that this movie gives Glory to racism or cruel animal treatment at all &gt;
B000000H57|5.0|Not much to be said that nobody else has already stated.  Still, living my life without mentioning how important this album is to me would be a sin.  This is the second most melodic, spooky, deep meaning album I own (Alice Cooper's DaDa wins that one), and it's so moody you'll think it's raining every time it's on.  \\"Love You to Death\\" and \\"Wolf Moon\\" are two of the most haunting songs I might ever hear.  Those two, among many others, are riddled with so much meaning it's impossible to not be moved.  This disc is... perfect.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Where do I start, firstly i was never a big radiohead fan at all, I had a mate who allways prazed The Bends album, but i was still into other bands anyway.<BR>I put the copy in my cd player and played it, and played it, probably like 5 times staight, and next day went and got the real thing. Lets get to the point, from the first string being hit on the first song to the last symbol on the last song this cd is a masterpiecue, nothing more to say. It takes u to souring skys, to dark dungens, makes u feel warm while making you feel totatly bemused by life. OK Computer is so good you will wonder how u managed to miss it, but then its not for everyone if u like top 40 forget it cause u wont like it. Also im a big nine inch nails fan, so any nin fans out there let the computer ride your wave.
0142004235|5.0|How wonderful that, through Oprah's discovery of it, so many readers will immerse themselves in this rich novel!  I've loved it since my freshman year of college (I spent a weekend devouring it after seeing the James Dean film.) I live in Northern California now, and Steinbeck's description of the Salinas Valley in spring rings true to me each year.  EAST OF EDEN is the Cain and Abel story (note how the names of Cathy, Abra and the Trasks start with C or A), but it's also the realization that through that story, we have been granted  freedom of choice, for good or ill.  And it is Steinbeck's own story; the Hamiltons were his mother's family, and how I loved getting acquainted with them.  I very much appreciate Lee, who subtly represents the multifaceted history of the Chinese people in this area. There is US history, from the Civil War to WWI, and the settling of California.  And there is, ultimately, the triumph of love over the evil of shame and doubt. The defining moment falls in the exact center of the book: Steinbeck was a master storyteller, and I am ever grateful he shared this one with us.
B00003CX95|3.0|Just a quick historical/geographic note for quite a few (!) reviewers on here. 'British' DOES NOT = 'English'. <br />People from Wales are Welsh, if they're from Scotland they're Scottish, from Northern Ireland, Irish and if from England you're English. Together they are `British' because they all come from the British Aisles and have the same passport.<br />So if big Mel was defending, \\"Scotland from the evil Brits\\" it's not only impossible but a case of shooting himself in the foot. Also remember a large part of the `British' army in America during the war of Independence were Scottish, sadly a fact Mel failed to mention in `The Patriot' strangely enough.
0142004235|5.0|I read this book for the first time many years ago because I am a John Steinbeck fan.  I thought that Grapes of Wrath was wonderful, but this book is even more mesmorizing.  You can picture the characters and actually feel the good and evil and confusion in each of them.  I read both Grapes of Wrath and East of Eden at least five times.  Both are lengthy, but both tell a story that will keep you up all night reading. If anyone has seen the old movie, it no way compares to the book.  What did compare to the book was a television mini-series way back in the 80's which starred Jane Seymour as Kathy.   It was wonderful and so portrayed this book and I am desperately trying to find it on DVD.  You will be so  disturbed by this book and you won't be able to put it down.  I was thrilled that Oprah finally read it!
0393057658|3.0|I got the impression from reading reviews and snipits from Moneyball, that the book would give me a &quot;fantastic&quot; new behind the scenes view of the A's front office and Billy Beane. The book had it's moments(specifically when Lewis went in depth about the A's &quot;new philosophy&quot; and how things went down before the trade deadline), but the thing I took from the book more than any other, is that Lewis is a master of filler. I got the impression that he went in-depth about the family-life/history of Chad Bradford and Scott Hatteberg because he wanted to make his book a more respectable length, because lets face it, the fact that Chad Bradford throws side-arm, or the fact that he was taught to throw sidearm by his highschool coach/preacher has absolutely nothing to do with the economics of the game and he loosely tied Bradford in with Voros who makes the miraculous discovery about how pitchers don't consistantly give up the same number of hits year-in and year-out(I'm not trying to demean the discovery).<br />I've seen some of the reviews saying &quot;WOW THIS IS THE BEST BASEBALL BOOK I'VE EVER READ&quot;, if that's the case, baseball books are in a equally sad state on par with the game and it's economics. It wasn't a bad book, but out of the 5 books I've read in the last three weeks, it falls in at number five from best to worst. As a baseball fanatic(and self-proclaimed stat nerd) I can't even fathom how this book could possibly be interesting to the average fan or baseball novice.
B000068TPN|5.0|Finally, the first good, realistic Vietnam War movie. Out of all the Vietnam War movies, hollywood hasn't gotten one, good, realistic, Vietnam movie, until now. We Were Soldiers has pretty much all the good aspects a good movie need, let alone a good war movie. Not only does it show the hardships on the battlefield, but at home, also. It shows the problems the wives of soldiers have to go through at home. Like taking care of the house and children, and not knowing whether her husband is dead, or alive.<br />Mel Gibson, the star of We Were Soldiers, plays Lt. Col. Hal Moore, the leader of a battalion in the 7th Calvary. He says he will be the first to set foot on the field, and the last to get off. He promises he will take everyone home, dead or alive. The battle is most of the movie, and it is a good battle, too. It has its share of vietnamize deaths, and American deaths. But before the battle, you get to know some of the soldiers first, especially Mel Gibson, so you can care about them. Like when one of the soldiers dies, you won't be saying, oh well. The battle is realistic, like there isn't one \\"clean\\" battle scene. The battle scenes always have dust and dirt in the air, and the soldiers cloths are dirty, so its realistic in that view. The deaths are realistic, also. There is blood, but not so much where the battlefield is covered in it. I'm very happy that hollywood, finally got one Vietnam movie right. So go out and rent it, you'll enjoy it.

B0000959N0|2.0|This had so much promise.  Daredevil was one of the least 'super' of all the superheroes that Marvel comics stamped their seal of approval on.  He was a troubled man with a troubled past and not much going for him other than his mind (hell the guy was a lawyer) and a hot babe in Elecktra Nachios.<BR>So what do they do?  They go out and hire pretty boy, Ben Affleck to play this role.  <BR>Jennifer Garner as Elecktra.  GEE DO YOU THINK SHE GOT THE ROLE BECAUSE SHE'S HOT?  'Nuff said.<br />Colin Farrell was the main highlight (not much competition) of this flick.  He was unstable and deadly.  Michael Clarke Duncan was a bad choice for Kingpin.  Although he's a good actor, Kingpin IS NOT BLACK.  Sorry, folks, but he just wasn't convincing in this role.  <BR>The plot was promising, especially at the beginning, but the action sequences just don't compare to the Matrix/Star Wars/Lord Of the Rings/Hulk movies as of late.  <BR>Ben Affleck has a hot girlfriend, but that's about it.  They should have picked someone else to play this role.<BR>Are they serious about Elecktra getting her own spin off movie???????
B00008NGHI|5.0|As an AKUS fan I already had much of the music on this disc so my purchasing it was as my first exposure to the SACD format.  The multichannel production is primarily stereo with center and rear channels providing ambient echo.  I'm still learning about SACD and its differneces over CD (PCM) are subtle.  Music (vocals in particular) are warmer and more realistic.  The &quot;edge&quot; present in CD recordings seems softer.  Details (subtle notes, whispers, etc) are heard more distinctly.  Alison's fine voice and the instruments of Union Station really do the SACD format justice.  Alison begans the track &quot;Down to the River&quot; acapella.  With only her voice to be heard I realized how good SACD can be.  Her singing on the track is simply the most realistic recording I have ever heard come through my speakers.  Beautiful group and lead singer - beautiful sounding recording
B00005RHGK|4.0|This movie is good. In fact it is very good. It is definately one of the more original Horror Movies that I've seen lately. The first first half-hour is great and suspenseful (I'm a jaded 13 year old and it actually scared me once). The second act is pretty good as we finally see the Creeper. The third act in the police station is still pretty good. To bad they had to ruin it all with the final frame. I mean it's pretty cool. (I won't reveal it to those of you who haven't seen it) The problem is that the ending's to abrupt and unsatisfying. It also has one huge plot hole. One you see it you'll probably figure it out. Not to say it's bad, I mean when you look back on it, it's pretty cool, but in the moment it's really, really lame.<br />Horror fans should see it, but beware of the final frame. It isn't pretty. Oh yeah, the song that represents the Creeper is great!<br />Jeepers Creepers, where did you get those peepers? Jeepers Creepers, how did you get those eyes!
B000068TPN|5.0|a powerful, believable film that captures what many consider the actual experience of the war. There's a nice balance between Hollywood story and action scenes with some surprises along the way.<br />In the midst of so many movies about this war, this one's a keeper.
B00004I9VE|4.0|Thriller is one of his best albums, besides &quot;Off the Wall&quot;. All the songs are great, like for instance, Baby Be Mine, Human Nature, and Lady of my Life. It's just a wonderful album that you would never get tired of.
0385504209|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read and I've read thousands of books.  This book combines mystery and murder with history to come up with a book that not only entertains you but educates you. It is an excellant book for discussion and debate because of the topic of the book. It is an eye opener for many, religious or not, and had me running to the computer to look at the art discussed in the book.  I was amazed to discover that I not only was what he described actually in the paintings but that I had missed it for so many years.  A wonderful wonderful book.  I am definitly going out to buy his other books.
0792833279|3.0|\\"Get Shorty\\" is supposed to be a mix between an Elmore Leonard novel (which it is based on), a Quentin Tarantino film, and a funny comedy. Too bad \\"funny comedy\\" can't be classified any clearer, because while I found \\"Get Shorty\\" amusing, it's nothing great. \\"Get Shorty\\" has to be one of the most overrated comedies I've seen in a long time. I expected something extremely clever and witty, and all I got was a funny-yet-average comedy that tries hard to evoke laughs and ends up with a sappy and predictable ending.<br />John Travolta plays a gangster oozing of self-confidence and charisma. He is a great mob collector, but he's always wanted to get in the Hollywood spot his whole life. So the movie follows him on a quest to make a movie in Hollywood, with the help of film producer Gene Hackman and the romantic interest of the film, Rene Russo. Danny DeVito joins in on the ride as a Hollywood filmmaker, and James Gandolfini plays a big, fierce but loveable hitman.<br />\\"Get Shorty\\" starts off with Travolta making his gangster rounds, and I was waiting to be extremely amused and absorbed in the film. But as it dragged on, I found that the film didn't really seem to go anywhere. It wanders around a lot, being something different than it could have been. I know a lot of people cherish this film, but pardon my ignorance: I don't see the attraction. What exactly is so darn funny about this film? Just because a comedy is dark, violent and slightly controversial doesn't always equal laughs. I try to dissect the thinking process of the filmmakers: violence + darkness + comedy = good movie. Unfortunately, this is how I view it: over-the-top, LOOK AT ME--I'M ORIGINAL-type-violence + wannabe Quentin Tarantino darkness = slightly amusing but all-in-all disappointing comedy. I'm not one to complain about pointless, gratuitous violence in film: I think people go over the top on bashing violent films. But to have violence just for the sake of trying to be original is like making an R-rated porno movie just to get people to wander at how it didn't get rated X. By making people gasp at an element of the film can be good, but not when it is in the way of, \\"Wow! How did they get away with that?\\"--it's just being controversial for the sake of being controversial. Making a movie like \\"Get Shorty\\" is a way for studio executives to cash in on a film that disguises language for intelligence, violence for fashion and darkness for smarts.<br />But apart from picking on this film, there are some things to praise it for. For example, the characters are well developed, and there are some great actors in this movie, even though I'm not a fan of Travolta. I just wish there had been a little more thought put into it, other than a bunch of filmmakers sitting down and trying to think of a controversial comedy.<br />Barry Sonnenfeld (director of \\"Men in Black\\") doesn't use the same humor as his previous films here, and I guess he does a fine job of adding a hint of darkness to the tale. But I can't help but wonder if Danny DeVito himself could have done a finer job.<br />All in all, disappointing, but still worth seeing when you've got the time.<br />I fear this is one of those comedies that I'll really love the second time around--I'll let you know if I enjoyed it more if I ever see it again.

Will Ferrell makes the movie HELLarious and I would go as far as to rate this movie one of the greatest comedies of all time. The characters are perfect and the trio of Ferrell Vaughn and Wilson is simply amazing. The scene where Ferrell shoots himself w/ the tranq gun, is the funniest scene I have ever seen, if you appreciate comedy at all you will buy this movie. It is an instant classic

0375422307|5.0|The fundamental flaw of most comic books is the writing.  While the art is often stunning, the stories are not as compelling and leave me disappointed.  Persepolis does not suffer from this flaw in the least.  The art is reminiscent of Maus inasmuch as it is minimally drawn, reminding one of hieratics at times.  Intensifying the impact of the simple images is writing that is profoundly touching.  Marjane Satrapi's writing is minimalistic but moving, like her drawings.  The story reads with an authenticity that is undeniably the voice of someone who  is testifying, not hypothesizing.  This is the only comic/illustrated book that ever made me want to cry.  It is worth your time.
B000002KLP|3.0|This is one of Prince's earlier CDs, of which I am not such a great fan. Don't get me wrong it's still good music, but a very short CD, just over thirty minutes. And the songs here don't have a whole lot to them, you know, crazy guitars and other instruments that the current Prince is famous for. The lyrics are interesting enough, I guess.<br />  If you are a fan of the early 80s material, a big Price fan, or maybe a music historian looking to discover where music started getting lowdown and dirty, then go for this album. Otherwise, go for the later Prince stuff.
B000092ZYX|3.0|Very dissonant beginnings, but midway through starts to loosen up and grab you.
B000092ZYX|5.0|It has been said that Radiohead is the most relevant rock band in the world right now.  Of course, some may argue that since they don't sell as many records as Justin or Christina, they really aren't as relevant as they seem.  It doesn't help that the last time we heard from Radiohead, they seemed almost out to destroy any claims at relevancy.  Kid A and its twin Amnesiac offered experimentation that many fans had a hard time swallowing.  Well, it's 2003 and, let me say, Radiohead is back to show the world that not only are they relevant, they are virtually divine.<br />One listen to Hail to the Thief's hypnotic melodies and enchanting lyrics will leave you spellbound.  Don't be mistaken, however, there is much experimentation still to be found on Hail, but this time it's magical.  Singer Thom Yorke no longer hides his tenor behind blips and beeps.  On several tracks, in fact, &quot;Sail to the Moon&quot; and &quot;The Gloaming,&quot; for example, Thom's voice is the most enchanting element.  <br />And there are distinguishable guitars on this album, too.  The album's opening track, &quot;2+2=5&quot; bursts into a frantic blitzkrieg as Thom places blame on apothetic audiences for the world's state of affairs.  &quot;You have not been paying attention!&quot;  In other moments of heartache, Thom declares that our &quot;alarm bells should be ringing&quot; (&quot;The Gloaming&quot;).  There is much wrong in the world reported by Radiohead.  Themes from family disfunction (&quot;Punch Up Drunk Wedding&quot;) to the perils of fame (&quot;A Wolf at the Door&quot;) receive new insight and gravity.  I'm pretty sure there's even a love song - &quot;Where I End and You Begin.&quot;<br />Never fear, however, bleak the situation appears.  The true magic of the record, and the sealing element in Radiohead's artistry, is the overwhelming optimism that underlies the angelic voices and distorted melodies.  Thom is not scolding the world for its disappointing state, rather, he's reminding us of what we can be if we should so desire.  Encouragement instead of despair seems to be the underlying theme.  <br />Although, the journey may seem bleak at times, with Radiohead guiding the way, there truly is light at the end of the tunnel.  Prepare to look back through the looking glass and see things the way they could be.  On Hail to the Thief, Radiohead rise as not only the most relevant group of musicians on the planet, but they emerge as the poetic artists that the world needs.
B00005JM03|5.0|I was very leary about seeing this movie at first... but I sure am glad I didn't miss out on seeing it!  It's awesome... good storyline, fun characters (and I have to say, this is the one group of actors in a heist caper that seem to have some good chemistry, unlike the remake of \\"Ocean's 11\\" where the interactions and such were cardboard and stale), unbelievable music by the brilliant John Powell, and just an all-around, lighthearted (although serious at times) movie.  The twist of Lyle being the REAL Napster was also a brilliant addition to the storyline and made it much more funny.  By the way, Charlize Theron looked HOT in just about ever scene...especially in the outfit she wears during the Mini Cooper chase/ending...yeah!
B00008MNYS|5.0|American success for Williams has been elusive...for reasons that pass my understanding. This is a brilliant collection of songs, handled with sincerity in some places and bombastic sarcasm in others.<br />&quot;Something Beautiful&quot; is the one that jumps out to me as U.S. single, although I don't know if that has happened yet. Bouncy and positive, it is the kind of upbeat pop song with some heft that were common in decades past but few if any have been able to pull off as of late. &quot;Come Undone&quot; is painful and introspective, but hauntingly beautiful as Williams wrestles with his inner contradictions (&quot;...so well trained, so animal...so 'need your love', so 'f*^k you all'.&quot;).<br />For those who enjoy the tongue-in-cheek Williams of the &quot;Millenium&quot; variety, there are gifts for you as well. &quot;Handsome Man&quot; contains a memorable wincer (&quot;I'm the one who put the Brit in celebrity.&quot;), and &quot;Monsoon&quot; is more along the lines of self-deprecating humor  (&quot;I'm here to make money and get laid...yeah, I'm a star but I'll fade&quot;).<br />All in all, a great album with only a couple of clinkers (unlike some other folks, I found &quot;Get A Little High&quot; to be kind of obnoxious). Other recommended tracks include &quot;Nans Song&quot; and &quot;One Fine Day.&quot;
B000002LK1|5.0|After having listened to some six of their albums, this is by far the best one I've encountered, with only one main shortcoming: it leaves you wanting more, since it only runs for 9 songs at approx. 5 minutes each. This album was such a pivotal point in their careers that their 2001 Exciter Tour DVD (ten years after the album was first released) showcases the album's three best works: \\"Waiting for the Night,\\" \\"Enjoy the Silence\\" and \\"Personal Jesus.\\" Yet, incredible tracks like the brilliant \\"Halo\\" and the intimate \\"Blue Dress\\" are missing... The point is this is one incredible album you can't get enough of. Though there have been some great works following it throughout the nineties, 'Ultra' is the only one that comes remotely close, and 'Violator' retains the place of Depeche Mode's best production to date.
B00005NOOH|5.0|This comprehensive visual history of WW2 covers the entire conflict, from prewar Germany, Japan and US, to the postwar recovery.  Narrated by Sir Laurence Olivier, newsreels and one of a kind interviews with now-deceased personalities make this a unique treasure.  Imagine hearing the words of Hitler's personal secretary and valet; Generals on the German staff; British and American government staff, and more.<br />The opening and closing theme for each episode is particularly touching.<br />This is a have-to-have, for any serious student of history.  And I would further recommend that history teachers devote time to showing one or more of these episodes.  They illustrate the invasion of the Soviet Union and the Fall of France better than any history book.
B00005JM1F|2.0|Not even comedy man Will Ferrell's appearance or Luke Wilson's charm, save this movie from the same place where movies such as Joe Dirt come from. There are a few moments that are probably bound to becoming classics, but unfortunately, if you saw the trailer, you saw most of the good stuff that the movie has to offer. When I first thought of the concept (a fraternity put together by guys already graduated, married and/or already entrenched in their professional lives) I thought: \\"clever idea, must be funny.\\" How wrong I was! For a comedy it falls short by a lot. The storyline could have gone in a lot of brilliant directions but it didn't. We rented it. It's not even worth renting, even if you get it for free because it's a guaranteed title in Blockbuster and they are out of it.
B000022TSW|5.0|If the people who rated \\"Fritz the Cat\\" NC-17 could only see this movie. Based on the incredibly popular and immensely hilarious Comedy Central show, \\"South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut\\" is a comic jewel that can be viewed and enjoyed over and over again. But it's not for the easily offended. The first few minutes, containing a song sang by the people of South Park, Colorado, is an innocent tune about being a child in a small mountain town. The four boys, Stan, Kyle, Eric, and Kenny are off to see a cartoon film based on their favorite TV show. This is the most innocent and G-rated the movie is. Once they step into the theater and hear the F-word, things get very explicit. Explicit, but absolutely hilarious. The songs in this movie are almost take-offs on classic Disney songs. But while it seems like they should be shoddy imitations of said-studio's work, they are actually very well-written and elaborate songs (the songs were even nominated for an Academy Award). The plot concerns the four mentioned children seeing an offensive Canadian film and using foul language in front of adults, causing their parents to ban the movie and declare war on Canada. There is so much this film makes fun of. Bill Gates, Dragonball Z, the military, Hell, ER, and Star Trek just to name a few. The spirit of the show is well in tact in this movie, which achieves almost legendary status among other comedies. I've viewed this film at least six times and can never stop laughing. It's not only an excellent film, but an excellent musical as well. It's a must-see and a must-own. Just keep it away from little children.
B000002I4S|5.0|When I was in high school and used to play like this (no, not even 1/10 as good as this), with just a drum backing me up, I thought I was just copying Don Menza (my heaviest influence at the time) or Sonny Rollins. I had pretty much discounted John Coltrane's playing as too \\"Avant-Garde\\". I didn't listen to enough of his LP's. Just stuff like \\"Kulu Si Mama\\" and \\"A Love Supreme.\\"  Little did I realize that Coltrane's \\"Sheets of Sound\\" had influenced mine and other sax players improvising.<br />Fantastic, inventive, imaginative, beautiful, excellent, marvelous, soulful, finger-snapping, foot-tapping, fast-paced music (especially Giant Steps and Mr. P.C.)by one of the greatest innovators of the tenor sax. Boy, was I ever ignorant of the genius of John Coltrane. BUY THIS CD.
0345440757|1.0|Someone bought me this book and I wish they hadn't wasted their money. Don't buy this book unless you are a Nazi. The breastfeeding advice is terrible and the use of pacifiers appalling. Artificial nipples (pacifiers and bottles etc.) should not be used by breastfed babies until after breastfeeding is well establish (6-8weeks). This is precisely the time when the author WANTS people to use them to \\"train\\" the baby. Babies need to be breastfed ON DEMAND to build and maintain a good supply of milk. What about letting the baby establish their own \\"schedule\\" in their own time?
B0000524CY|5.0|Ask enough people what the scariest movie they've ever seen is and you'll get The Exorcist from a good number. Something about combining religion and horror that works on some folks and this is still the best and influenced a ton of pretenders over the years. A demon or is it the devil himself possesses the body of a young girl and the results are fabulous. No one has ever forgotten this film after viewing I think. The strong screenplay and story due to William Peter Blatty along with some very believable acting create a forceful movie that has shocked generations. There are many classic scenes here with vomit flying on priests, heads spinning 360 degrees, cross masturbation, and loads of cussing from a once sweet little girl. I always thought it was strange how long it took for anyone to believe Regan's poor mother about what was going on here. The sounds coming from the attic were always a cool, disturbing moment in the movie to me. Some of the subtle points of the film are just as creepy as the full throttle assault coming from our possessed friends mouth and urethra. The theatrical re-release was great and it was very cool to finally see this thing on the big screen. The new stair- walking scene was a worthy addition in my view. This got more awes at the theater I was in than anything else. What else can ya say here? The moment we see the two priests step into that cold bedroom we know there's gonna be hell to pay! The Exorcist scared your parents (some of your grandparents) and it will do the same to you. It also has one of the most memorable musical scores ever. This movie is a true American classic and not to be missed.

B00003CXZ1|5.0|Once in a review, Roger Ebert side that the best way to critisize a movie is to make another movie, ans that, in that respect, SHANGHAI NOON was the answer WILD WILD WEST. HE was sure right. SHANGHAI NOON was the pick of the litter out of those two films, easily one of the best of 2000.<br />So, in that respect, TOMB RAIDER is the answer to CHARLIES ANGELS. The movie opens with a scene that's destined to go down in action film history, as Lady Lara Croft (The beautiful Angelina Jolie) battles with a robot during a training session for her adventures. One night, she discovers clock hidden in the Croft mansion. It turns out that the clock is a key that will lead the holder to the two separate halves of the Triangle of Light, an artifact that can give the user \\"the Power of God\\". The Illuminati are a secret society who want to rule the world, so they steal the clock so they can find the Triangle. Lara goes into the jungles of India after them. Can Lara Croft stop the Illuminati before they get ahold of the Triangle and stop them before the balance of the universe is irrepairably thrown out of whack?<br />Angelina Jolie is said to be the next female action star, and that's good, since we have kind of a vacuum in the genre lately and we could stand to add a few more, so why not make her female?As Lara Croft, she is a fearless adventurer who never gives up, always gets the prize, and packs a mean punch. Jolie's acting skills are quite good as well. I don't think I've ever heard a more realistic British accent (except, of course, from actual Brits.)<br />If Lara Croft is this generations Indiana Jones, that makes me feel satisfied, since she can always tell when a man's lying (what lawyer studies clocks as a hobby?), she can bunjee jump through her own house without even breaking a sweat, and looks good in leather. Okay, I not gonna be the gawking male chauvenist, it's just that she's really attractive, and I'm a guy. What'd you expect?<br />Being the big action fan that Iam, I did really get a kick out of this movie. It has a lot of action, great scenery (I've always wanted to go to India.), and has to be one of the best movie adapted from a video game ever. It's just as good as STREET FIGHTER, RESIDENT EVIL, MORTAL KOMBAT, and MORTAL KOMBAT:ANNHILATION. Ultimately, what makes it btter than CHARLIES ANGELS is that it not only treats it's female star with more dignity (granted, she does have a nude scene, but in CHARLIES ANGELS, they're forced to YODLE!!!!!), it also only has one girl that we have to keep up with. And I'm willing to bet that by herself, Lara could whup the Angels butts. This is the female lead action movie to see, and I can't wait for TOMB RAIDER:CRADLE OF LIFE, cause Lara Croft rules!!! <br />And I'd just like to say, Angelina, you are such a babe.

B000002TPS|5.0|19/20  (rounded up to 5 stars) <br />Basically if you don't have any Megadeth albums but you like hard rock/speed metal, than this is a CD for your collection (ie if you hate the barking [garbage] that bands like Pantera put out, yet still enjoy their guitar, you'll like this one.  It's got great catchy lyrics (Dave's voice is great on this one) & great guitar & drums.  This album would have been a lot bigger had Megadeth's name not been Megadeth & they actually got some radio/tv time.  For those of you who don't know the reason Cryptics got so much more airtime, they didn't include their name when the sent it to radio stations).  <br />My bro wasn't a fan of Mega's early work (I gave him KIMB...BIG for xmas one yr & he gave it back to me [I know that is a slap in the face]) but I got him hooked on Countdown, Youthanasia & Cryptic. This album has only got 2 songs that aren't that great. <br />I give: <BR>9. Youthanasia an A- <BR>11. Black Curtains an C+<BR>  <BR>All the other songs on this are A or A+ material.<br />GET THIS ALBUM*<br />*if you only like really heavy music then you might not like this but if you love speed metal & some hard rock you'll love this.

B00008O31H|5.0|To Everyone who is tired of nu-metal and sick of garge punk bands taking the sound of legands.  Then the black keys duo is the best stuff for you.  Many people say rock has died, I think it has just changed.

B00003CXXJ|5.0|When Shrek was on the theaters i didn't see it although many of my friends and relatives did. I wasn't much fond of cartoon movies and I was a bit uncertain about spending my money in one.<BR>When the movie was on VHS I rented it, a bit reluctanctly must say, and took it home. I have to say I haven't laughed that loud and much for years! <BR>You could say children will be more addicted to it, I concede that, but also adults will find entertainment and enjoy a bit more than an hour of fine humor.<br />The plot is really well thought and it makes fun of all those fairy tales you used to read when little (like Cinderella, Snowwhite and such). <BR>The voices are excellent and Mike Myers &amp; Eddie Murphy characterizations are superb!<BR>As soon as I bought my DVD this was the very first movie I got, and I watch it regularly from time to time once and again.<br />Wish you could enjoy it as much as I did!
B00005JKNF|1.0|I was so looking forward to seeing this movie, with all the wonderful reviews I'd read.  The movie was boring, difficult to understand, and vulgar.  I watched the whole thing, thinking it was going to get better any minute, but it never did.  By the end of the movie, I wished the entire cast had been murdered...
B00008DDXC|4.0|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets exceeded my expectations for a book-to-film as well as a sequel in a very hyped up franchise.  The movie was relatively well-directed, and the young actors are certainly growing in to their characters.  John Williams's score was once again enchanting and mood-setting.  The set design was superb, the environment really draws you in.<br />Compared to the theatrical release, the DVD version does justice, with stunning visual crispness and incredible sound.  The DVD extras are mainly for kids, though.  We all hope that the next film will cater to the aging Harry Potter crowd, which now includes teenagers as a primary demographic - those children who are about Harry's age.  Chamber of Secrets was a step up from its predecessor in terms of maturity required to watch the film, though, as it deals with darker themes and edge-of-seat action sequences.  This is definitely a movie for which you will benefit from your expensive surround-sound system, progressive scan DVD player, and HDTV.<br />While the movie is acceptable for those who have never read the book - in fact, they will garner more excitement from the plot than those of us who have parts of the script memorized - it will likely be a waste of 2.5 hours for the worst muggles who are vehement non-fans of the series.  The movies, after all, are fairly true to the books in story and style.<br />As usual, I recommend reading before viewing.  The DVD falls short of the 5-star rating because of its over-juvenilization and occassional poor direction.  I expect the future sequels to only improve, if only marginally, and make Harry Potter the greatest fantasy film series for all ages to date, save perhaps Lord of the Rings.
0688163173|4.0|Dennis Lehane had a problem after Mystic River.  How does one follow up that brilliant psychological drama?  Shutter Island is the answer and it will probably disappoint fans of Mystic River as it seems a throw-back to an earlier form of crime novel, more stylized than naturalistic.  This new novel takes place on one very dark and stormy night and the cliches do not stop piling up after that.  The author even seems to love this chance to indulge in as many as he can squeeze through the pages.  There is a wonderfully clammy paranoic feel to the book, making its setting in the early fifties feel appopriate.  The mystery becomes a little obvious and somewhat forced so it is best if the reader just hangs on and enjoys the ride without thinking too much.  A decent follow-up, much heavier on creeping suspense than intelligent insight and charaterization than his previous books, but still worth the trip.

B00005OM4N|4.0|'Britney' is Britney Spears's third studio album released in 2001.  While partially being a soundtrack to her movie \\"Crossroads\\" which came out in 2002, Britney also showed us that she was growing up into a more mature person.  Being Britney's most recent release, we are able to see a more mature Britney through her music.  Although the fourth album isn't due out for a few more months (in late 2003), this CD seems to be Britney's best up to date.  Britney looks better than ever and she's also singing better than ever.  On 'Britney', Britney leaves the more bubble-gum pop image into a more mature pop image and throws out decent songs.  Being a fan of the Pop genre, for the five years Britney's been out - my feelings have been mixed for her during her changing image.  But I think now, Britney has finally decided what to do with her image and her music.  We can expect a great fourth upcoming album from one of the Princesses of Pop.  Here are my ratings for 'Britney'.<br />1) \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" - (4/5) - Being a slave to the music and proclaming she's not a little girl, Britney attempts to make this a dance song.  Although the music is slightly not appealing, its beat is still enough to make you wanna get up and dance.<BR>2) \\"Overprotected\\" - (5/5) - Saying she's tired of being overprotected, Britney pumps out this upbeat song about turning into more of a woman and facing the responsibilities she has as a person - being independent and herself.<BR>3) \\"Lonely\\" - (3.5/5) - This song is upbeat and about a girl finally giving up a relationship that wasn't working out and saying that she'd never be lonely without him.  It's a nice song, but not one of the better ones.<BR>4) \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\" - (5/5) -  A nice ballad co-written by Dido - Britney talks about how she's maturing from a girl into a woman.  This is one of the best songs on 'Britney'.<BR>5) \\"Boys\\" - (4.5/5) - Sounding very relative to the first track on 'Britney', Britney offers another upbeat, attempted dance song.  This is a very nice track, but it could've used a bit more work.<BR>6) \\"Anticipating\\" - (2.5/5) - As stated in a previous review, this song is too up-beat and sounds like a cheesy disco song.  The words speak for itself.<BR>7) \\"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\\" - (5/5) - A very nice cover of the original song, Britney shows that her choices of cover songs are getting better and sounding a whole lot better.  This song is nicely done.  Sadly, many of the reviews say this song was a total failure - not true!<BR>8) \\"Cinderella\\" - (4.5/5) - What seems to be a better remake of \\"Stronger\\", this is a very good song.<BR>9) \\"Let Me Be\\" - (4/5) - A nice song.. but nothing I would keep the repeat button on.<BR>10) \\"Bombastic Love\\" - (5/5) - I was predicting reggae music like \\"Soda Pop\\" - but I wasn't left disappointed.  This song does sound like it should've been on 'Oops!...I Did It Again' since it is very poppy, but it's a very nice song.<BR>11) \\"That's Where You Take Me\\" - (2.5/5) - This song sounds very baby-ish and very poppy.  This song would be a great candidate if it were voted to be transfered to '...Baby One More Time'.<BR>12) \\"What It's Like To Be Me\\" - (4.5/5) - A nice song co-written by her then boyfriend Justin Timberlake who also provides some nice vocals in the song, I thought this song was going go be about what it's like to be Britney Spears - but it's about Britney telling a guy that if he wants to be with her, he has to know what it's like to be her in order for him to show his true love.  A nicely done song - a perfect for ending 'Britney'.<br />Britney sure does show a more mature side of herself, moving far, far away from the innocent bubble-gum pop image to a more mature Pop side.  This is the best album of Britney's yet - the songs are great, she looks great, and her voice is sounding better than ever.  Britney is now showing her more grown-up side and it looks like she has some catching up to do with rival Christina Aguilera who released her second album Stripped in late 2002.  But surely enough, Britney will top her own three previously released studio albums and become an even bigger music supserstar than she already is.
B00005QK39|3.0|As a bass player I am probably more sensitive to this than others but the drumming on this album is really very amateurish. I am a fan of both pre and post Fish Marrilion and really feel that this album could have ranked alongside any of their other classics but the drumming distracts my ear to the point that I play this album rarely, A great pity because as a lot of other reviewers have said there are some great Fish lyrics and Rothery Guitar. Also for a first effort the songwritting is of a high standard.
B000002HAF|5.0|We Pixies fans may disagree about which is the best Pixies album but we love them all almost like they were our children.  Surfer Rosa is not the perfect child; it's actually a little less consistent than Doolittle or even its shorter brother, Come on Pilgrim.  That still makes it better than the best album put out by 98% of bands who sell more records.<br />Surfer Rosa thrashes a little harder than the aforementioned Pixies' disks.  Despite the hard edge of this record, what is apparent here (and on Pilgrim and Doolittle) is the Pixies' sense of fun.  The goofiness, the crazy rhythms, the vocal gymnastics are all present.  It is often said that the Pixies influenced many alternative heroes who came after them, most notably Nirvana.  It's too bad that some of their successors didn't learn to adopt the Pixies sense of humor.  That Seattle crowd always seemed so serious about themselves and their music.

B00006RINF|5.0|Lacuna Coil is a band that deserves much more recognition that they receive. Comalies is by far their best work and their love for the project shines through on almost every track. Cristina is still one of the most talented front women in rock, and her voice remains haunting and emotive. Musically the CD is rife with richly textured melodies and surprisingly effective string arrangments. Every song on the disk is worth listening to, and the more you listen the deeper you feel the music. It is quite a testament to the creativity and synergy of a band when you can listen to a song and always get something different from it. If you are a fan of Evanescence or the Gathering, then you owe it to yourself to pick up a copy of Comalies. You will be glad you did.<br />Standout Tracks:<br />Swamped<br />Daylight Dancer<br />Aeon<br />Tight Rope<br />Entwined<br />Angel's Punishment
B000002HAF|5.0|We Pixies fans may disagree about which is the best Pixies album but we love them all almost like they were our children.  Surfer Rosa is not the perfect child; it's actually a little less consistent than Doolittle or even its shorter brother, Come on Pilgrim.  That still makes it better than the best album put out by 98% of bands who sell more records.<br />Surfer Rosa thrashes a little harder than the aforementioned Pixies' disks.  Despite the hard edge of this record, what is apparent here (and on Pilgrim and Doolittle) is the Pixies' sense of fun.  The goofiness, the crazy rhythms, the vocal gymnastics are all present.  It is often said that the Pixies influenced many alternative heroes who came after them, most notably Nirvana.  It's too bad that some of their successors didn't learn to adopt the Pixies sense of humor.  That Seattle crowd always seemed so serious about themselves and their music.
B00005NKCM|3.0|Through the years I have watched PBS Masterpiece Theatre for its remakes of Classic Novels, but British TV didn't interest me because I normally don't watch \\"Typical TV\\" until I got married & started watching romantic movie comedies with my wife. Some of our favorites: \\"You-re Got Mail\\" & \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\" always had references to older Romantic classic movies or novels. Therefore we found ourselves watching & loving many Jean Austin remakes including several A&E DVD's. This lead to a British invasion within our house starting with \\"Darling Buds of May\\" & \\"All Creatures Great & Small\\". \\"Darling Buds of May\\" was a little racy for our taste & \\"All Creatures Great & Small\\" started out rather slow, but in the end we have been watching these 2 British TV Classics over & over. I then told my wife about \\"Upstairs Downstairs\\" & we decided not to buy the whole series, but to test out the first season. The series is rather racy for our tastes (as was \\"Darling Buds of May\\"), normally at a PG level, but at times travels up to a R rating & just when you think it will go too far, it jumps back to PG just in time. We were both surprise to see Pauline Collins of \\"No, Honesty\\" as a maid named Sarah in the first Black & White series. For my review, I will not write about the plots & characters because other people before me have done a great job & we need not repeat them here. As a professional photographer (wedding photographer for 15 years) & owner of a better than avg 5.1 audio video system (NHT 5.1) the Black & White series has better photography & sound: all very clean & clear. The color series on the other hand, is a wreak both sight & sound. There are at times late 1960ish TV lines that invaded the screen that throw off the timing of the sound. This must be a straight no edited copy that has no value as a piece of photography art, but a run through just to get the product out. In fact, there is a VHS hum throughout, something I never experienced with a DVD. As a British TV series with the actors & plot, I would rate this as a 4, but as a DVD a 2, therefore the avg out is 3. Both me & my wife will not continue with the series because there were no moral outcomes within the first season. Maybe this is not the place to start the series, but then again, where does one start if not the beginning?V series with the actors & plot, I would rate this as a 4, but as a DVD a 2, therefore the avg out is 3.

B00005B36H|5.0|Listening to Tool is like being on drugs, minus the health risks of course. Listening to Aemina, Undertow, Opiate, and everything else by Tool is like being on pot. <br />Listening to Lateralus is like being on LSD.<BR>There is really not a better comparison. Musically, Lateralus is perhaps the most complex and interesting CD in the history of rock music. The rhythms are precise, and the magestic chord changes and strange chords themselves are a new world wonder.<br />The only bad thing about Lateralus is that there is not a standout track. The Grudge and Lateralus are both unbelievable songs, perhaps Tool's best two. So although there is no standout track, Lateralus is a standout album. Listen to it and you will be wrapped up in it for a good solid 75 minutes.
B000002LEU|5.0|This collection is the perfect introduction to Joy Division.  I might argue that you don't need more than this recording because Joy Division wasn't around long enough to make that much music and this retrospective gathers most of the most memorable and accessible songs from their short career.  <br />Unknown Pleasures and Closer are the ones that always seem to end up of the best albums list but this one seems a better single album to me than either of those.  First of all, this one has more music than the others.  Secondly, it concentrates on their singles which were the most accessible and most instantly likeable of their recordings.  A pretty good dance record too in an alterno goth sort of way.  Highlights for me are Warsaw (a wonderfully typical slice of 70s British punk), Digital (a great primitive mosh pit kind of number), She's Lost Control (a gloomy disco classic), the tortured Dead Souls, and the beautiful Atmosphere.  All this and Love Will Tear Us Apart, too!  This is a must have and you'll love this album even more with time.
B00005JLWN|4.0|to compare this movie to the overhyped matrix, is a injustice.<BR>despitr it'swellian influences, equilibrium stands on it's own as an action sci-fi flick. no cheesy dialogue, but more like comic book noir. the fight scences were the best since the BLADE films.  the pacing of the story was slow and a bit dull but so was the matrix.<br />at least you can identify with bale's character, the ending although predictable. completed the story, thus no need for a sequel. it's the best sci-fi b-movie since the terminator or escape from new york. skip senseless [stuff] like XXX or the borne identitiy and buy this movie.
B000002LR6|3.0|The problem with Ministry's music is a problem with industrial hardcore in general - it fairly quickly wears out it's welcome.  The fist pumping head banging mood that it gives you is great for awhile but the relentless hardcore techno dirge lacks variation or any subtlety and soon grows thin.  NWO is a great hard and nasty opener to this record but a song like Jesus Built My Hot Rod seems little more than a metallic novelty after the first few listens.  I'm not surprised that Ministry's fan base has dwindled.  They no longer sound as fierce as they once did and can't offer much other than heard-it-before techno aggression.  I'm not saying this is a bad album; it has its moments but I think preciously few would select it for their 10 recordings to take to a desert island.  Their earlier recording, The Land of Rape and Honey, is a better album but is still fairly relentless serving of ugly hardcore techno.
0064409422|5.0|This is the first book in a long series that takes us away to a fantasy world. It is a world full of danger, excitement, and even new friends. It is a world that most people drift off to. It may not be the same, but we all drift of into the world of kings and queens, talking animals, and a place that we can call our own. In this story, the four kids find this place and with it find an adventure and a life the could only dream of before that faithful day when the entered the world through the wardrobe.I recommed it to anyone who likes a good story.
B000005IS1|4.0|I first picked up this album many years ago at the age of 13.  Although I really liked some of it, much of it was a little too relentlessly noisy and repetitive for my tastes.  But time has been kind to this release.  Years full of noise and thrash later, this album seems truly ahead of its time and I can now more fully appreciate its power. In retrospect, it doesn't seem nearly as monotonously assaulting as some of the punk/thrash/metal of the last 30 plus years.<br />I once heard Iggy Pop describe in a television interview from the late 70s how he liked music that emulated the sound of machine pistons pumping (perhaps influenced by Detroit).  More than any album I can think of Kick Out the Jams comes closest to that sound - much more so than the Stooges' Funhouse with its primitive funk/rock rhythms or Raw Power with its more proto-punk feeling.  While I think those Stooges' albums are superior to this one, they are definitely different.  The MC5 are often described as an ancestor to punk but I think they are more appropriately classified as an ancestor to metal.  This turbo charged live disk is full of clanging metal and shrieking noise in a way that hadn't happened before and hasn't really been duplicated since.<br />I don't give this album a 5 star rating only because I dock it a little for the over-long and at times embarrassingly self-indulgent Starship and for I Want You Right Now which, although shorter, shares some of those same faults.  Since these are the last two songs on this release, you can just press stop here and not miss any of the great moments that come before them.<br />And great moments this album does have.  The opening sequence with the rabble rousing revolution speach breaking into Rambling Rose still ranks as one of the most exciting moments captured on any live rock album in history.  That's followed by Kick Out the Jams which is legendary by this point in time.  Come Together isn't one of the strongest cuts on the record (a little too monotonous) but it's a fine example of sonic noise.  Even more so is Rocket Reducer #62 (Rama Lama Fa Fa Fa), definitely one of the highest points of the record.  Borderline is fine but the album's strongest cut is probably it's slowest and most traditional - Motor City is Burning.  This is raw, jagged, searing blues played with such down and dirty gusto that it makes you wonder why the MC5 didn't choose to go more in this direction with their music.<br />Not all of us would agree with the choices made by the group on this live recording and many would prefer other singers than Rob Tyner or other players than some of the band members but, like it or not, there's no doubt that they are giving it their all for you.
0385335482|5.0|This is probably the book of my life...really! I was hooked by the very first (or was it the second, anyway) page of it. It's hillarious, insightful, and (honestly) some times close-to-reality kind of story. It's an (almost) ordinary girl's story, only emphasized to the very humouristic side of it. I could not let the book down for a second. Thus, once i finished it, I had to go buy book 2 and 3 (it's always an investment, of course!). Well in two days (never happened to me before) I finished number 2, and in less than one I am in the middle of the third one. And English is not even my native language! It used to take me more than a month for a book half of the size of this one.<BR>There's a lot in this book for every kind of person, even if you don't live in heavy traffic, capitalist cities. This book takes you in a journey through dead flat materialistic talk, to more phylosophical life-meaning search conversation type.<BR>I'm hooked and waiting for a fourth story. It's your turn now...
B000008GEF|5.0|I just bought this Cd today, braced for disappointment, given that I had never really heard much about this Cd, but with high hopes still, as I am a huge George fan. What I got surpassed my dreams-it is a GREAT album, very focused, and powerful. George's philosphy on life is very clear here, he is all about peace and understanding, and the songs are quite low-key but beautiful. I love it!!! Along with All Things, Cloud Nine and Brainwashed, this is one of his greatest efforts. George is no longer living in the Material world but his soul and spirit will forever live on. Peace George+++++++++++++++
B00005JLRT|3.0|What makes a Trek film? Well to start a fine, fast moving plot intwined with action and a fine balance of characters and their development, this is something that Star Trek II accomplished with flying colors and what Star Trek X had some problems with. <BR>  The beginning with the Wedding was a nice way to get us back into familiararity with the characters we've come to know in the last 15 years, so we see anymore of them later, not really. I still dont understand why you hire 7 supporting cast mates if they arent goin to do anything, Star Trek II primarily focused on Kirk but there was fine dialogue between Kirk n McCoy, Spock and Saavik, Scotty and the death of his nephew, all of this was contributed to the film. Dr. Crusher didnt do anyting, Riker was a lil overprotective but thats all he did, Data, since he had B-4 nobody cared, and Worf had his own set of problems. <BR>  Something that Rick Berman hasnt caught onto yet is that Star Trek Fans are extremely acute at pointing out continuity problems, and Nemesis had alot, Datas' Emotions, What happened to Lore, Wasnt Worf an Ambassador, just to name a few, these issues totally ruin a Star Trek movie this is something that Treks dont have a problem with because they know it is extremely important. Also I fail to see y you would relese this right ontop of LOTR II that was a marketing problem and is why i beleive it did not perform well. The story started off nicely, totally died with the dinner with Picard and Shinzon, then picked up again, i hate to say it but part of that movie made me sleepy. People hark over Stuart Baird but all in all his directing was fine, John Logan on the other hand, his script was a disaster, pretty good story had a lot of continuity problems and he couldnt keep a balanced plot, and to make it worse they took out scenes which would've helped the transistions a lil better. the acting was superb by those who infact acted. not a bad movie, just not the best, not a good idea to hire two out ffranchise people to helm your movie. I enjoyed it nonetheless and I hope u do too!
0553583182|5.0|I've been of student of personal development for the last 15 years and have benefited greatly from various authors and their materials.  For some reason I missed this one but once I read it I knew this book was something special.  The concepts, strategies, organizaton and summaries are first rate.  Definitely an easy read with ways to implement quickly and effectively.  Put this one on your reading list if you are serious about making a change.  One of the classics.
B00005N5S5|4.0|This movie was definitely a breakthrough movie. It had a great story, good effects, (for an old movie,)and good acting. I don't think that they could have picked anyone better than Arnold and Linda. I know that &quot;they&quot; are planning to make T3 and 4, and I really hope that (if any of you have played it) they refer to the game, and concentrate more on John Connors father, Reese.
0790729342|4.0|First, I'd like to say THANK YOU to all the reviewers who get on here and discuss DVD transfer quality instead of just frothing at the mouth about how great the movie is. (That comment especially applies to the film Blade Runner.)<BR>Now, I don't know if there is an accepted name for it, but some Warner DVDs have a recurring transfer problem which is evident at many points in the film.  The Road Warrior is one of those DVDs.  Therefore I wait expectantly for a potential Special Edition of this film, with a cleaned-up transfer.  My personal opinion is that a DVD is not supposed to look like it's been put together by amateurs.  It's supposed to recreate the theatrical experience of the film.  In other words, Warner needs to clean up its act.<BR>My rating for the film itself is really a 5; the 4 is a &quot;qualified 4&quot;, relating to the transfer.  The film itself is great.  At this point in the story, there don't seem to be any vestiges of normal civilization around, and the plot is all about a group of people who are defending a fuel refinery from hordes of encroaching wasteland dwellers.  There's also a nice synopsis of Max's origin which contains a montage from the first film.<BR>Despite the acclaim given to the first film's action sequences, there's more going on here, and the villains are more fearsome.  Another thing about this movie is that the scenery ( Broken Hill, Australia ) is incredible; the unique essence of Australian geography is brought out.  <BR>Note for subtitle aficionados: If you keep an eye on the English subtitles all the way through, you'll see a subtitle or two that might be a little bit questionable. ( As in : where did they hear THAT? )
B00004TRD8|5.0|I think that this movie really topped the first. Edward Furlong was a good pick for John Connor, but unfortunately he won't return in T3 due to drug problems. On the note of T3, I must say I'm a little dissapointed. Not that I won't see the movie, but the whole \\"save John\\" plot is gettin old. I think that T4 should either be based on his father, Kyle Reese, or on the war itself. Either way this movie is classic, and I plan to see any further Terminator movie in the future.
B000062YAZ|3.0|no i'm not gonna throw this album away because of the satanic lyrics or because i listened to metallica master of puppets i've looked at all the 1 star reviews and can honestly say that even though the death and dying and satanic lyrics show immaturity in songwriting, this album is still groundbreaking .  though at times i think it is just mindless rambling but stilll i let the album grow a bit and i started to like most of the songs.again the satanic and death and dying are both corny.but i can still honestly that overall this is a fairly good album.
B00005JLXE|4.0|I think this movie got alot less credit then what it really deserved. I think people just didn't like it as much because DareDevil wasn't the kind of super hero with the fancy powers or gizmos. In my opinion it was better than I actually thought it would be. Before seeing X2 this was the best marvel super-hero movie yet. I think that the cast really pulled through with their characters, and the DareDevil costume was done really well. *Conclusion* This was a really good movie in my opinion and I don't care what other people say about it, it's still one of my favorites.
B00004R9A4|5.0|If you enjoy the look and tone of vintage Disney (Mary Poppins, Pollyanna), you will probably like this utterly wholesome (and a bit bizarre) tale of an apprentice witch and three London urchins flying on a bed under the ocean, facing an animated animal team in soccer and, with the aid of rekindled armies, repulsing a Nazi invasion.  Roddy MacDowell makes comic appearances as a young minister, and David Tomlinson is the British Dick van Dyke..<br />DVD extras are excellent and include: featurettes, stills, 4 trailers, 4 promotional trailers, a reconstructed \\"lost\\" song, a Donald Duck cartoon and a Mickey Mouse cartoon!  The film can be viewed with closed captioning or French subtitles, if desired.<br />Great fun and all very well done.
B00003CX8J|4.0|I think that this movie should be seen as an introduction to a series. People have to understand that with these super-hero movies, the sequels will always top the originals. The first will always be about introducing the story, which i think X-Men did very well while still maintaining a good plot. Overall this was a good movie. It could have been better, and at the same time it could have been much worse.
B00005JL96|5.0|Based on the trailers I was not looking forward to this film, but it won me over quickly, and I watched the whole thing with pleasure.  Lilo is a lonely little girl living with her older sister who is broke, looking for work, and trying to be a mother to her troubled, sad little sister.  Stitch is an illegally created alien who has escaped to Earth and been placed in a Hawaiian dog kennel.  Upon meeting, the two are immediately inseparable, to hilarious effect.  The writing is very funny throughout.  There are good guys, bad guys who turn out to be good guys, really bad guys, and Stitch -- the character who changes the most (&#34;Are you sure he's a dog!?&#34;) through the course of the film.  And there's a fair amount of Elvis.  What's not to love here?<br /><br />DVD extras are excellent.  There are well-done featurettes about the production (including storyboarding, voice sessions and music), animation, Hawaii, the hula, and Stitch's persistent attempts to get on the big screen; a trivia game; 3 music videos; 4 trailers; 3 deleted scenes; and 9 promotional trailers for other films.<br />The film can be heard in English, French or Spanish, and subtitles are available in English.<br />Very nice dvd package indeed, and a fine funny family film.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Forget the half naked teenagers, the screeching divas, the depressing grunge leftovers, and the rude rappers! This is real music. You can understand the words, you can distinguish the melodies. It's not country or bluegrass, not pop or folk, it's pure old-fashioned toe-tapping soul-feeding music. Pour yourself a cold lemonade, sit on the porch swing, recall your passed relatives and relax with this lush yet simple collection.
0375703764|5.0|I read this book in August of last year, and I literally would not read it when I was by myself.  I don't typically find myself being scared when I'm alone, nor do I usually feel threatened by darkness or large open (or closed) spaces, but this book made me think about all the \\"what if\\"'s.<br />Now, you have to be very open minded when reading this book.  It is very chaotic - not only by what is happening in the text, but the text itself - and it should be.  I've seen the reviews where people criticized the way the text was formatted on the pages, but what I feel these people were neglecting is that the text itself was a reflection of the mood of the story at the time.  The more stressful and insane the story got, so did the formatting.  <BR>To me, that's just pure genius.  <BR>I've read other stories that had the same feel to them - the whole stream-of-conscious writing style where the reader goes mad while the character in the story goes mad - but this book epitimized that writing technique.<br />To summarize the whole story... it's a story about Johnny Truant, who, like his name, is a truant.  He works in a tattoo parlor, does an array of drugs, and goes out partying, but he's really a smart guy and you wonder why he's doing it to himself.  (which you find out in the footnotes and various ramblings)<br />He ends up stealing a chest of papers from Zumpano after his death - I say stealing because Zumpano is found dead in his apartment... windows all blacked out and claw marks in the floor? He didn't really know Zumpano, but he watched him out in the courtyard with all the cats... and when the cats stopped coming, the mystery was hightened.<br />Truant decides he's going to finish Zumpano's work... and then he's lead down the same path.  He lives vicariously through the the footnotes that Zumpano's added to this documentary about the Navidson Files and soon, he's actually LIVING the nightmare he's trying to tell.  It's facinating.  <br />And the HOUSE!  The conceptthat there could be a door to a black whole of a world, where in reality, if you're on the other side, the door shouldn't even exist is just mind boggling! And, the fact that the space inside the door becomes more massive the more fearful, stressed, more panicked the people inside the house become.. it's literally like the house feeds on these people's emotions.  It's great.  Truly worth reading.<br />Be prepared to be haunted.
B00004XQ83|5.0|This soundtrack mesmerized me with it's stripped down beauty. It is not a bluegrass album, nor is it a collection of old music. Somehow, the tracks chosen for this cd are a snapshot of a place and time. Songs covered by artists well known and barely known to current music listeners are as important to the movie as the actors themselves, and are a great intro to this old time music. The cd is beautifully recorded and oozes charm and nostalgia without being too heavy. Norman Blake, Alison Krauss and the Peasall girls are my favorites. I wore out one copy and had to order another! (It sounds great when played along with Leon Redbone's \\"Anytime\\", old Johnny Cash, or even vintage blues. I used \\"O Brother\\" as music for my vintage family photo cd; it fits the sepia photos.)<BR>When I first saw \\"Lady sings the blues\\", I was smitten with the beauty of the old music and the skill with which it was presented by Diana Ross. It was wonderful on it's own, yet made me seek out the original Billie Holiday music. Same thing with \\"O Brother\\". Just a perfect listening experience.
B000060P79|5.0|What can I say?! This is one really great CD. I'm not much of a punk/rock band fan, but I love Simple Plan! (Hey! That rhymes!) All of the songs on this CD are really great, and very catchy. Their songs touch on real life issues that everyone can identify with. You are sure to love all of their music! Give Simple Plan a try! You'll thank yourself later. ;-D
B000069HK2|5.0|I'm the kind of person that usually burns most of my cd's. But when i heard The Used on the radio with &quot;Buried Myself Alive&quot; i just knew i had to have this cd. the first time i listened to it i fell in love with it. with their strong lyrics as well as the great rythym, the used has definilately perfected their album and created a name for themselves. the most attractive tracks are between 5-12. the music is so amazing its hard to tell what their next single will be. they have great tracks such as the more depressing song &quot;Blue and Yellow&quot; as well as more violent lyric songs such as &quot;Box of Sharp Objects&quot; and &quot;Bulimic&quot;. The Used are a little bit of NIN along with some of Thursday. the last song &quot;Pieces Mended&quot; is a 12 minute song that is definilately worth listening too. at one point of the song the singer goes on yelling for at least 2 min straight,(awesome guitar solo as well). Anyways, if i haven't heard of THe Used, spread the word, these guys are great, you won't find any &quot;POP&quot; like songs in here, jsut pure hardcore music.
B000092ZYX|1.0|I've read the RAVE reviews about this 'hotch potch' and I wonder if I am listening to the same album.<br />From the simple guitar chords of 2+2=5 that meader around until finaly giving some energy, (in small quantity: like the rest of the album), to the simple synth sound of 'a wolf a the door', this album is lack lustre and self indulgent.<br />'Backdrifts tries to lift the band from simple chords with an electronic, almost clubby feel, but once again the weak wailing of Thom Yorke sound reminicent of Madonna on a bad day.<br />'The Gloaming' is trying to be catchy and commercial but does not reach the standard of, for example 'Coldplay'. Throughout this album you have the incoherent and feeble vocals of Yorke backed up by the simplistic guitar and schoolboy synth of the rest.<br />Just listen to 'myxomatosis' and you'd wish you had it! vocals and lyrics are awful and the tune is even worse.<br />Followed by 'scatterbrain', the same song and almost as bad for the same reasons.<br />When do you listen to such a misguided and musically inept bunch of songs? I would suggest in the shower, without headphones!!
B000060P79|4.0|First of all, let me start by saying that I was never into Simple Plan. Only because they came across as pop-punk and they were an &quot;at the moment&quot; band. But after listening to some of their songs, I decided to buy the CD. It's a pretty good CD. I'm more into the harder punk, like Sum 41, but this is good for when you want to just have fun. I noticed some of the songs were kind of the same. I like the song &quot;You Don't Mean Anything,&quot; it's really catchy and gets stuck in your head. I like basically all of the songs, this is good since it's their first, but I'm expecting some different topics the next time around.
B00008CLOA|5.0|I cannot compare this version to the original LPs, as I have never heard them.  I actually recently aquired an older special edition LP copy of DSOTM, but still have not heard it.  However, I do have 5.1 SACD player with a DTS decoder, and it makes this album sound exactly as I always dreamed it would.  Its one of my favorite albums of all time, and the obvious time and effort into making it sound spectacular in surround sound are worthy of 5 stars.  Even the stereo track sounds much better than the other more recend US CD releases I'm used to (as a yonger generation Floyd fan).  <br />Of course, being remastered from original masters 30 years old, it will not be as good as a remaster of those same copies made 15 years ago.  But most of the easily accessible versions of this album are recorded from 3rd, 4th, and 5th generation remasters.  Compared to those, this edition is wonderful in stereo.  And the 5.1 surround sound is a completely new kind of experience under any circumstances.
079213690X|4.0|if you have seen the movie as many times as i have you may have noticed that when young william wallace and his friend hemish are throwing stones at the piled rocks at the beginning of the movie when william's dad is away fighting you can clearly see young william throw the rock with his left hand and when he gets older and meets up with hamish again and they throw rocks at each other mel gibson throws with right hand!hard to believe that you can be that good with both hands!
0142004235|5.0|Steinbeck can be a bit heavy-handed at times with metaphor and moral, but this book is a wonderful read.  I discovered it as an adolescent 30 years ago, and it still ranks as one of my all-time favorites.  I'm delighted that Oprah has introduced it to a new generation!  You are going to love this book.  It's a can't-put-down page turner.
B00005KARK|1.0|Wow- open your eyes, folks. I don't care if it was made 200 years ago, this is not the kind of cultural message I want to give to my little boy. Not to mention, the taunting, scary pink elephants, fire, drunkeness....Disgusting! Oh, and if your mom helps you through it, they lock her up. Nice messages for the little people (NOT!)
B000002JQ6|4.0|Overall this is a great live cd, it contains most of thier best and most populer songs.  However the album doesnt really stick to you.  By this I mean most of the songs get old fast but, still it's a great cd for any kind of AC/DC fan.
B00005QK39|5.0|It would be so easy to write an essay on Script for a Jester's Tear - as there is so much depth to it.<br />For now, I'll cut to the chase - the music. Here we have a band launching themselves into the \\"progressive\\" arena, but there's something odd about them compared to the others. Sure, there are similarities with Genesis - the godfathers of progressive - but so there are with most progressive bands to some extent. Often, it is the likenesses with Genesis that make them progressive.<br />Marillion, though, courted other audiences. The intricate web of sounds created by the 1982 lineup of Mark Kelly's delicate, haunting and original (if simplistic) keyboard style, Pete Trewavas' solid, mesmerising and melodic bass lines and Steve Rothery's wide pallette of rhythm, lead and fill chords created a sound that belongs purely to Marillion.<br />In their music, you can hear scorching guitar solos - not Eddie Van Halen speed, but Dave Gilmor gorgeous, popular music styles - there's funk, reggae and everything else that was boiling around the charts back in the early '80s - without giving in to the cliched '80s sound. In fact, the music is perenially fresh and timeless.<br />Fish's lyrics add a newer dimension - as a lyricist he has yet to be surpassed, even on this early outing. Forget that his vocal style leans heavily towards Gabriel, that doesn't matter. It is merely the vehicle for the words, which are intricately mixed with the music in a narcotic fusion.<br />It wasn't until Mick Pointer was replaced by Ian Mosley in 1984, in time for the Fugazi album, that the drums really became an integral part of the music, but Pointer manages to keep everything together extremely well. In fact, there are several details which go \\"beyond the call\\" - but not in the fluent style of Mosley.<br />As an album, Script is just as much as a concept as any that followed it. The opening \\"So here I am once more...\\", sung quietly and a capella, followed by a single piano chord, is genius - and ironically appropriate for a debut album. This song, incidentally, sets the mood for all the albums (and other songs!) that follow, so it could be considered that Marillion's output with Fish is one entire concept in itself.<br />He Knows, You Know was a chart hit for the band, and provides an angry contrast to Script. It is a pity in a way that this was a single, because over-familiarity can ruin its place in the concept of this album, if you let it.<br />The Web returns to the opening sentiments. The music of this piece is stunning in its simplicity, structured effects and self-contradictory complexities. Long words, maybe, but I've already used the word genius.<br />The following 3 tracks were all that comprised the original album, and are structured similarly, so that if you had the vinyl LP, you would get the perfect balance. In CD form, it still works - Chelsea Monday contains one of the best guitar solos I've ever heard, and has structure to die for - Garden Party is whimsical, by Marillion's standards, and was a chart hit for the band. It complements \\"Chelsea Monday\\" perfectly, being its antithesis. And what better way to follow it than with Forgotten Sons - a marvel of musical engineering. It positively drips structure, yet feels improvised. This is part of the point of prog, and Marillion knew it well, even at this point in their careers.<br />Lyrical highs;<BR>(Script...)<BR>I act the role in classic style Of a martyr carved with twisted smile<BR>To bleed the lyric for this song To write the rites to right my wrongs <BR>(He Knows...)<BR>Slash wrist, scarlet fever, crawled under your bathroom door<BR>Pumping arteries ooze the problem, through the gap that the razor tore <BR>(Chelsea Monday)<BR>Catalogue princess, apprentice seductress Hiding in her cellophane world in glitter town <BR>Awaiting the prince in his white Capri Dynamic young Tarzan courts the bedsit queen<BR>(The Web)<BR>I realise I hold the key to freedom Oh I cannot let my life be ruled bythreads <BR>The time has come to make decisions The changes have to be made<BR>(Garden Party)<BR>Smiles polluted with false charm Locking on to Royal arms<BR>Society columns now ensured Returns to mingle with the crowds<BR>(Forgotten Sons)<BR>Minister, Minister care for your children<BR>Order them not into damnation<BR>To eliminate those who would trespass against you<BR>For whose is the kingdom, the power, the glory for ever and ever<BR>Amen<br />This is a fine album that should be in the collection of everyone that really enjoys music. It's not an album for all occasions, but if you happen to play it at just that point in time when your mood and Fish's when he wrote the words cross, it will totally knock you out. <br />I could say that about all Marillion's albums from the Fish era, of course.<br />ESSENTIAL LISTENING - BUY IT.
B0000035E7|4.0|Nirvana's first album is very good but still not thier best.  The songs on the album are fun to listen and easy to play.  I would probably recomend this album to a begginer guitarest.  For the first couple of months I was playing guitar I listened to this album not stop as well as the other Nirvana CDs.  But I would still recomend this album to any hard-core grunge rock fan.
B00005YW4H|1.0|I guess there's no accounting for taste, so maybe I'll try to stick to the facts.  This is an album of soft, poofy jazz-like softness, sparse instrumentation and homogeneous arrangments that do not make a statement.  She sings competently with a breathy style, doing the exact same thing the exact same way.  All the songs are pretty much exactly the same.<br />If that's what you are into then you'll dig this.  Personally, I'm into songs that have definite parts, and albums that have definite songs.  I'm not impressed with Grammy winners.  I like music.<br />I had an Algebra teacher in high school that spoke in the same monotone for 55 minutes.  You reaction to that will be your reaction to this record.  Soothing...comforting...unchallenging...bland...it's an insomnia cure for me.
B000069AUI|4.0|This album is a fantastic follow up to &quot;Parachutes&quot; and definitely solidifies Coldplay's place in world music. Although holistically not as great of an album as their first, track 4 - The Scientist in &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; definitely makes the purchase worthwhile. <BR>The Scientist must be one of the most wonderfully meloncholic songs that is incredibly captivating. It possesses the ability to transport the listener from wherever they are to a soulfully aching, yet amazingly therapeutic realm of calm.<BR>I know this is meant to be an album review but I can't get over how beautiful The Scientist is. It awakens a deep pain that eventually subsides with a soothing wave of relief.
0385504209|4.0|This book actually reminds me of Jurassic Park, and other books by Michael Crichton.  The author really knows his subject (or can fake it well enough to get past a non-expert), and includes enough details to disguise the fact that the entire premise is pretty preposterous.  You can't take away from Brown that he wrote a real page-turner...it was suspenseful and the puzzles were fun to try to figure out.  Anyone who is interested in art, history, religion, and especially the combination of the three will enjoy it.
B000068FUS|5.0|It's really hard to write a review for one of my favorite records, because no matter what I say, it's still going to come out sounding biased.  Oh well, here goes:<br />&quot;Southern Rock Opera&quot; is nothing short of amazing.  Sounding something like a cross between Skynyrd and Crazy Horse, the sound is raw, ragged, and thick as the Southern air that it was recorded in and it sounds great.  Patterson Hood has a voice that makes me think of a more gravelly Don Henley and Mike Cooley reminds me of Steve Earle back in the &quot;Guitar Town&quot; days. <BR>Add to that, a triple-guitar assault and you've got one hell of a band.  The music here is so atmospheric, I get homesick every time I play it.  <br />There are two discs here so I'm not going to attempt a track-by-track run-down here but I will say that the album is best when played from start to finish, there are some great highlights that would work well as singles (Zip City) and I never get tired of hearing the spoken word &quot;The Three Alabama Icons&quot;.  <br />You can't go wrong with this one.  Just get it and see what all the hype is about.  The critics were right about this one.  I'd reccommend this to just about any fan of real music.
B000002C1W|5.0|Learning to Fly, One Slip and Sorrow are my favorites. But also, if you hear the first seconds of Dogs of War or Yet Another Movie, you'll understand why I consider this CD a masterpiece.<BR>Basically you can hear all this CD without having to skip any songs, because they are all great and deep.
B00005JLPK|2.0|I bought this movie for my mami who was looking forward to it coming out in DVD so she could hear it in Spanish.  How did she come to this assumption? My fault! I naturally assumed that a movie about Frida, Mexican artist who spoke Spanish, made by Salma Hayek, again a Mexican artist who speaks Spanish, would have Spanish audio.<br />I was very very disappointed and my mami was so upset she didn't even want to watch it.  Therefore I was forced to return it, find another present and not have the dvd there to remind my mami of her disappointment.<br />I'm so upset that I would like to find out how to let that person who made the decision to have FRENCH audio instead of Spanish have a piece of my mami's and my mind.
B000002A3T|5.0|Take it Back ... what a refreshing great song!<BR>Great Day for Freedom and Coming Back to Life are nice ballads.<BR>High Hopes is the musical definition for Nostalgia, is a nice song too, maybe a little too sad but still a great composition.<BR>If you like Pink Floyd and David Gilmour, you will like this CD.
B00000K19E|4.0|Four-and-a-half stars<br />For me, there are two Matrices: The one I lose myself in while watching, and the one that I dissect afterwards. First, The Matrix in action.<br />The Matrix is the most visually dense, dazzling picture I've ever seen. From the title design of endlessly flowing green numbers, to the fight scene, to the exquisitely choreographed chase, to the bang-up conclusion, the opening sequence is breathtaking. The kinetic action is perfectly accompanied by Don Davis' score, which at that point evokes the dark feel of a classic, Hollywood thriller. And the writer-directors, the Wachowski brothers (Bound), make every shot tell.<br />The story is about a future in which humans created machines so intelligent, that the machines won a war which left the world a desert, and humans their slaves. Most of the humans now live in pods, until they are harvested by the machines for energy. The rest live in \\"the matrix,\\" a virtual world created by the machines to delude the humans that they live in a gleaming, prosperous city -- actually, gleaming, prosperous Sydney, Australia. (The movie is muddled as to whether or how some humans aren't living in pods. I've seen it twice, and still am not clear on this.)<br />The idea of \\"the matrix\\" as technological dream world, evokes Marxist guru Herbert Marcuse's 1960s book, One Dimensional Man. Marcuse couldn't explain how he was able to see through the technofog that deluded everyone else. The Wachowskis do a somewhat better job of explaining that part. They also take a page or two from Alice in Wonderland, The Planet of the Apes, 1984, and even Japanese comic books.<br />It is the \\"agents\\" who give the machines a \\"human\\" face. The agents look like feds (maybe I need to rethink that bit about the \\"'human' face\\") - replete with ear pieces, sunglasses and interchangeable, nondescript suits - but they are machines; hence their superhuman power and speed. (The Wachowskis also throw in some \\"shape-shifting,\\" a trope from New Age/American Indian mythology, which was introduced in the movies in Thunderheart.) As \\"Agent Smith,\\" Aussie actor Hugo Weaving is a memorable heavy.<br />A hardy band of human freedom fighters traveling around in a rusty old \\"Mark III\\" ship and a circa-1965 Lincoln Continental (the Wachowskis evidently have a soft spot for old Lincolns), in addition to those whom we don't see, back in the city of Zion at the earth's core, are humanity's last, best hope.<br />The picture alternates between didacticism and action. Most of the lessons are taught by \\"Morpheus\\" (Laurence Fishburne) who initially seems to be the savior, but who is actually he who will groom the Saviour, \\"The One.\\"<br />Enter \\"Neo\\" (Keanu Reeves), the hacker whose name is clearly an anagram of One, as in The. The movie hinges on whether Neo is The One.<br />The other main character, \\"Trinity\\" (Carrie-Ann Moss), is a passionate, butt-kicking female member of the rebel troupe.<br />Perhaps the greatest accomplishment of The Matrix, is that within a set-up that could easily have deteriorated into New Age verbal diarrhea and emotionally empty technical effects, the movie makes you -- or at least, me -- care deeply about these people.<BR> <BR>The cast does praiseworthy work, especially Fishburne, Moss, and in a brief but moving scene, Gloria Foster (\\"the Oracle\\"), a woman of a certain age who still looks great. The stars clearly do a lot of the fighting themselves. Note, too, the forty stunt men who risked their very real butts for your virtual pleasure.<br />Now, let's consider the elements that get lost in the sights and sounds of viewing.<br />* The movie suggests a Christ-like savior, but This One has little in common with Christianity's Messiah.<br />* I'm not crazy about Keanu Reeves; he's no Gene Hackman. And as for fictional saviors, I much prefer Lance Henriksen's tortured, all-too-human \\"Frank Black\\" from the classic Chris Carter TV series, Millennium.<br />* The science is terrible, but then, it seems that \\"s/f\\" almost always gets the \\"s\\" wrong. Computers will never be able to initiate thought and action.<br />* A parallel problem is the depiction of human beings learning physical skills without any physical practice, through merely having software downloaded into their brains.<br />* Why is The Oracle fallible, and why does she quote the phrase \\"Know thyself\\" in Latin, instead of the original Greek?<br />* As movie critic Steve Sailor pointed out, the movie perfectly matches Hollywood's notions of multiculturalism: The heavies are all pasty-faced white guys, whereas the good guys are a mix of blacks and whites.<br />All of the above issues must be compartmentalized while watching the movie, in order to enjoy it. (I know - I'm too literal-minded.)<br />Note that while kids usually love The Matrix, it's also not necessarily a good idea to watch it with very young ones. At its conclusion, my three-year-old started whacking away at me, in his best imitation of kung fu. And so, you might not want to show this to any of your children, prior to their thirtieth birthday.<br />The DVD is chock full of goodies. One feature allows you to watch the movie with subtitles, in order to see how Don Davis' music subtly carries it. Davis breaks in at times, with his own commentary. His score is a serendipitous mélange of styles - from classic thriller-style to punk rock - fashioned to match the unique mood of each scene.<br />Another feature gives you the option of stopping the movie, to view footage of the special effects that went into the scene being shown. The purist in me complains, \\"That's like a magician explaining how he does his tricks,\\" but the guy who at 18 wanted to become a movie director, says, \\"More! More! More! The more knowledge, the better!\\"<br />Yet another feature, on the making of The Matrix, focuses on the Hong Kong-style kung fu training the cast endured for some six months, and the \\"bullet-time\\" special effects invented for the movie.<br />With this DVD youget your money's worth, and then some.
B000002JQ6|5.0|I would have to say that is the best album you could buy from AC/DC. It has all of the classics, like: Thunderstruck, Back and Black and most of there hit songs they put out in the late 60's and early 70's. I would have to say if you wanna own a AC/DC album and want great hits this would have to be the album to puchase it is well worth it. I am never gonna get tired of this CD.
B000055Y0Y|4.0|A smart, taut thriller with a sense of humor, In the Line of Fire was directed by Wolfgang Petersen (Das Boot, Air Force One, A Perfect Storm) and produced by Clint Eastwood, Petersen, and others. (Eastwood doesnt take a producers credit, but his longtime associate, David Valdes, is listed as executive producer). The movie pits Eastwoods dinosaur of a Secret Service agent with a past (Frank Horrigan) against John Malkovichs effete snob psychopath (\\"Booth\\"). \\"Booth,\\" a cashiered CIA assassin, wants to get even with his former employer, and write himself a page in the history books, a la John Wilkes Booth, by killing a president; Frank aims to stop him.<br />Rene Russo plays a gorgeous, younger Secret Service agent (Lilly Raines) whom Frank goes out of his way to irritate, beginning with their first encounter. (Frank: The secretaries keep getting prettier and prettier. Lilly: And the field agents get older and older.)<br />(In the Line of Fires storyline was surely inspired in large part by Stephen Sondheims 1990-91 musical theater masterpiece, Assassins. Failing even to make it to Broadway, Assassins was a commercial flop of historical proportions, but in this critics opinion, contains the greatest of all of Sondheims scores. Led by its own Booth as narrator, Assassins speculates that all presidential assassins were bound by the need to achieve a perverse form of greatness; that through killing a great man, they too would achieve a sort of second-hand greatness and immortality, even if it was only the immortality of men whose names would be cursed throughout history.)<br />Booth has obsessively studied the history of presidential assassins, particularly the Kennedy assassination. Thats what brings him and Frank together. Frank was one of JFKs bodyguards; indeed, he was Kennedys favorite. He had Kennedys ear. But when the time came, on that fateful, November morning in Dallas, Frank heard the first shot, but failed to react. That failure has tortured him ever since. Booth knows this, and in teasing, almost erotic telephone calls, relentlessly needles Frank about it. (Late at night, when the demons come, do you see the rifle coming out of that window, or do you see Kennedy's head being blown apart? If you'd reacted to that first shot, could you have gotten there in time to stop the big bullet? And if you had -- that could've been your head being blown apart. Do you wish you'd succeeded, Frank? Or is life too precious?)<br />In order to keep the cat-and-mouse game interesting, Booth gives Frank clues and assistance along the way.<br />The hammy Malkovich, who sounds like a decadent, tenured, postmodern professor of literature, earned a best supporting actor Oscar nomination. (Watching the President, I -- I couldn't help wondering why a man like you would risk his life to save a man like that. You have such a strange job -- I can't decide if it's heroic or absurd. Frank: Just how does it work? Booth: It doesn't work, Frank. God doesn't punish the wicked and reward the righteous. Everyone dies. Some die because they deserve to; others die simply because they come from Minneapolis. It's random and it's meaningless. Frank: Well, if none of this means anything... why kill the President? Booth: To punctuate the dreariness.)<br />By contrast, Eastwood drolly plays off his flinty, plainspoken characters age and infirmities. And watching Russo could break a mans heart, wondering, If only Hollywood directors had had the sense to make her a star when she was 25 or 30, instead of waiting until she was 38, to notice her. But as Brett Walters marvelous imdb.com bio shows, it turns out she had a life, B.H. (before Hollywood).<br />Jeff Maguires original script is so good, that it gets not only the big stuff  the diabolical bad guy and the red herrings that the heavy throws the heroes way -- but also the little things that so often make me wince during a thriller. He gives Eastwood and Russo dialogue they can work with, so that they can make us believe, without insulting our intelligence, that Lilly might just give an old rust bucket like Frank a whirl.<br />But amid all the action and clever small talk, Maguire provides a melancholy background music binding the characters, who recall a time when we had presidents worth taking a bullet for. (At the time, Bill Clinton was president, but I cant say if the melancholy referred to him personally.) No wonder, he was nominated for an Oscar (he lost out to Jane Campion, for the vastly overrated The Piano.)<br />Film editor Anne V. Coates was also nominated for an Oscar. Coates, who had won an Oscar for 1962s Lawrence of Arabia, lost out to Michael Kahn of Schindlers List.<br />Eastwood was already on a roll (as both actor and director  see Unforgiven, A Beautiful World, The Bridges of Madison County and Absolute Power) when he made In the Line of Fire, which started Russo on one (Get Shorty, Tin Cup, The Thomas Crown Affair).<br />Wolfgang Petersens deft direction keeps things moving, and is so unaffected and unobtrusive, that Im left with little to point to. Petersen and Maguire cleverly work Eastwoods personal fondness for playing the piano into the story.<br />Eastwood, Malkovich, and Russo are ably supported by a cast that includes Gary Cole, Fred Thompson, John Mahoney, Dylan McDermott and the District of Columbia.<br />Will Booth prevail, or will Frank redeem himself? That is the question.
B000002JR8|5.0|Far Beyond Driven is by far my favorite CD of all time by any artist.  It is really heavy with great vocals and the songs are just great.
B00005JLXE|3.0|Daredevil is a movie that is just alright! It's no way near Spider-Man or X-Men 2! Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner do a very good job, it's too bad they didn't have a good script to go with their acting. The script was all over the place, that was the problem. It was like they didn't know what to do with the movie. They were just trying to get it out in a hurry so they made it .... This Movie could have been a lot better! Still, it's an alright movie, but your better off just seeing Spider-Man! Spider-Man is sooooo much better than this movie by far!
0060005424|5.0|Garth Nix's second book in his Old Kingdom trilogy is a real winner.  Set in the same world as the first book in the trilogy, you first meet fourteen - year - old Lirael at the Clayr's Glacier.  She lives among a large community of women who can see into the future, but she is two years past the average age for gaining the Sight.  Also, she looks different than the rest of her loosely related cousins, having black hair and pale skin.<br />Prince Sameth, the son of Sabriel and Touchstone, is deathly (no pun intended) afraid of his increasing duties to defend the Old Kingdom from the Dead in life after a nearly fatal encounter with a necromancer.  However, he never has a good opportunity to talk to his busy mother about this, and lives in fear of The Book of the Dead, which contains the lore and findings of all the Abhorsens since the Charter, which is the main magical force in the Old Kingdom, was woven.<br />These two are characters that anyone can relate to.  Most people have felt like they don't fit in at one time or another - Lirael is an interesting metaphor for the isolation that occurs in school - and it's easy to feel sympathetic to the case of Sameth, who is so scared of letting his parents down that he can't talk to them about not wanting to be Abhorsen when his mother retires.<br />Many other characters make the book special.  The Disreputable Dog, Lirael's magical companion, adds both a mysterious and humorous note to the book.  The always - cynical Mogget, companion to the Abhorsens, is a funny addition to the book.<br />Overall, Lirael is a story about finding out who you really are and learning that it's not so bad to be yourself.

B000089RVX|5.0|This is about as anti-Spice Girls as you can get. This band is obviously the product of talent and hard work, and a combination of Amy Lee's incredible vocal skills and just great hard rock music packs quite a punch!<br />I'm not usually into Gothic-style anything, but I knew the moment I heard the incredible &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; during &quot;Daredevil&quot; that this band is not your average &quot;some guy screaming into a microphone while someone hits the same guitar lick 30 times&quot; cookie-cutter hard rock effort that I'm so sick of.<br />Amy's voice is beautiful, and her ability to make it sound so different and heartbreakingly emotional is the obvious thing that sets Evanescence apart. Her voice is so powerful that she can believably overshadow the guitar on the intense songs -- and she does it without resorting to the mindless bellowing that some singers seem to think is the only way to sound &quot;hard rock.&quot; She is equally adept at the wrenchingly beautiful ballads such as &quot;My Immortal.&quot;<br />To top it off, the band writes its own songs, an increasing rarity in the music industry. What a breath of fresh air Evanescence is. When I heard this album the first time, it was like, &quot;Ahhh...now *this* is music!&quot;<br />In a nutshell, this band has a unique sound and does its own thing with the band members' own talent and sweat, and that is almost impossible to come by in the land of corporate-driven tunes that has come to dominate the industry. I don't care *how* Evanescence snuck in the door -- MORE!!
B00003003R|5.0|It amazes me that many people rank Nirvana or any other Grunge band  of the early 90's as the great bands in that Era. Those people must be musically challenged or still have that 12 yr old mentality which they had during the time they listened to those bands. Are you kidding me those bands couldn't hang with GNR on their best day. GNR represented true rock who's style extended to Metal Heads and the casual rock fan. With songs like Welcome to the Jungle ( A true Adrenaline Rush) night Train (another Adrenaline rush), Sweet Child O mine ( A true classic which is still played today) Paradise city ( an awesome melodic tune which transforms into a high charged rock song) and many other songs  which you know, Guns and roses set themselves miles apart any hair band of the 80's or Grunge band of the 90's. Thier music was great their look was cool and they   were the greatest band since Led Zep and werent the posers that Poison and Montley Crue were because GNR style was Unique and Original to an extent. Lets face it, this album represents how ecclectic and charasmatic Guns N roses were with Axel's passionate vocals and their overall stage presence along with thier great music which resulted in them attracting a full capacity of fans in any stadium concert they had and and a rock society that revolved around thier presence. They were true rock to the core on par with Led Zep or the rolling Stones. This band had all the characteristics to rank them amoungst the greatest rock bands in history which they were on their way to become  until they halted their production in 93. Hopefully thier comeback will sustain the appeal they had back in the 90's although Axel is the only remaining significant member in their comeback however, he was the spirit of the band and the main factor which made them go.
B00006RU5B|4.0|Although I am not a fan of Rage Against the Machine, I was really glad to hear Chris Cornell's voice again and was impressed with the artist's musical evolution via Audioslave. I know this may sound crazy to some, but as a scifi fan, I really like this album. It has a touch of the weird, and a lot of the guitar sounds very scifi -- especially on &quot;Like a Stone,&quot; in which it seems like it's straight out of Dr. Who! While some songs on this album did not appeal to me, the ones I like are so good that it made up for it. I am eagerly awaiting the next album.<br />I realize I have a very different take on this band than most, but if you like scifi and have enjoyed rock/hard rock in the past or especially Cornell's work, then this album has all of those elements in abundance.
B00008RH3L|4.0|This is the 90's version of a Road to Perdition I suppose.  It's about the power struggles of the Mob in city, and one man who is the puppeteer of two crime bosses. Most of the performances are great, and at the time, many of the actors were virtually unknowns. I'd rank this just behind The Godfather and Goodfellas in term of prestige in the ganster genre, and above Scarface. A welcome addition to any collection, and precusor to Quentin Tarrentino's Pulp Fiction/Reservoir dogs.
B000001FS3|5.0|Most people reach a stage in life when the philosophical questions loom large. Do I serve a purpose? Does life have a significant meaning? Can I make a difference? What am I really looking for? Most of us reach private conclusions, but a talented few can enrich the lives of those around them by sharing their inner journey with a wider audience.<br />It's a difficult and dangerous undertaking. Such baring of the soul must tread an exacting line, or it risks becoming melodramatic, contrived and maudlin. The cynics among us are forever ready to pounce on the least slip-up; ready to gut a whole artistic work on the slightest perception of insincerity.<br />So, making an album like The Joshua Tree takes courage.<br />This album is a journal of the boys' inner lives. In previous albums, they established their intellectual, moral, political and musical credentials. In this one, they lay claim to their spiritual credentials.<br />There's been so much written about the sublime quality of the songs, the three opening numbers, the lesser known but not lesser quality gems throughout, that it makes no sense for me to offer yet another critique of them. But craftsmanship, talent, consistency and ingenuity are found in many albums beside this one. There has been a lot of masterful Rock turned out over the years. Why is this one at the top of so many classic album lists?<br />It's because this one tackles the toughest questions in a way that we can all identify with and understand. It's more than just a rebellious shout, or a political tract or self-indulgent introspection. And it's far more than just four guys making pretty tunes.<br />Consider \\"Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\". It yearns for a deeper meaning in life while avoiding both facetiousness and self-pity. Or listen to \\"One Tree Hill\\". This is about a life that really meant something to the boys and achieves an expression in memoriam that few of us can aspire to in a lifetime. We should all have such epitaphs.<br/>It's hard to pin down what makes this album so special. In the end, I think it's the marriage of the album's heartfelt sincerity coupled to its utter lack of pretension. The boys don't pretend to have the answers. They don't even pretend to deep or significant questions, though I think they do a fine job asking them all the same. What they achieve is an expression of the spiritual yearnings that most of us ask ourselves at some point in our lives. This music comforts us with the knowledge that these are questions common to us all: that even if we don't ever manage to find the answers, it's the capacity to ask the questions that count, and the quest for answers that gives dimension to our lives.
B00008DDSC|4.0|I suberb indy feel movie about several quirky Floridians that lead's to an dominant and submissive relationship. Very tastefully shot and edited. Finding exquisite sensuality in the unlikeliest of circumstances.  James Spaders best work since Sex, Lies and Videotape.  If you enjoy this film, you might alos like American Psycho with Christian Bale. And vice versa.
B0000027RL|5.0|This is the album that defined my life through Junior High and High School. This is the album that turned me on to Modern/Alternative/Rock Music. You can hear the influence today on the radio by bands that are cheap imitations trying to emulate the sound that this album put forth. The huge hit \\"Jeremy\\" is probably my least favorite song on the album. Track by track the album takes you on a roller coaster ride of emotions. From a music standpoint \\"Vs.\\" is probably more diverse and well produced album, but \\"Ten\\" is the one that paved the way. Some of the tracks from Vs seem thrown together from different eras, but every song from Ten seems like it belongs. You will not be disappointed.
B00008H2LB|1.0|in short, i just don't believe the authenticity of this band and their music. i believe that they blatantly ripped off the work of lebbeus woods in a set piece for their first video 'somewhere i belong'.  look at the cover image of the book 'radical reconstruction'. in the video, you will find a sculpture that clearly copies this design.
B00006SFBD|5.0|Opeth are one of the finer progressive metal bands I've heard, I think.  You've heard it 1000 times before:  Opeth takes incredibly heavy riffs and death metal growling and mixes them with regular vocals, melodic guitar riffs, and often acoustic guitars.  This does not get old; Opeth keeps every album fresh and original.  On \\"Deliverance\\", the heaviness is kicked up a notch, and the melody and clean vocals take a bit of a back step.  Now, don't get me wrong.  There are some great acoustic guitar parts, but overall this is Opeth's heaviest album.  <br />Just because it's heavier doesn't mean the songs are shorter.  The songs are still in the 10-13 minute range, except for the brief instrumental \\"For Absent Friends\\".  Opeth are very talented musicians, and they have a unique songwriting style.  Peter Lindgren adds his melodic solos to many parts, and they are often paralyzingly beautiful (\\"A Fair Judgment\\" and \\"For Absent Friends\\" especially, but all his solos are good).  Martin Lopez tears it up on this album, with pounding dopulbe bass and super fast fills, but he also knows how to lay back and play for the song, which he does most of the time.<br />Opening up the album is a lightning quick drum fill and a super-heavy guitar riff.  Mikael's vocals come in reminding me of Cannibal Corpse.  He's really developed a deeper voice since the days of \\"Morningrise\\".  I like it better.  The song slows down after a few minutes to a more melodic part in 6/8, that's stunningly beautiful, although still pretty heavy.  The title track is familiar Opeth, but much more heavy and intense.  The end vamps on an amazing timed guitar riff.  You'll know the one when it comes.  It's sick as hell.  \\"Master's Apprentice\\" almost reminds me of Black-album Metallica, until the vocals come in.  It has that crunchy \\"Sad But True\\" feel though.  The song gets more interesting though, with some nice melodic bits in the middle.  \\"By The Pain I See in Others\\" features some death metal vocals over a clean guitar bit.  It sounded weird as hell to me at first, but now I think it sounds right, in a demented way.  Great song.<br />In addition to the heavier parts, this album features perhaps the most beautiful Opeth song to date (not including anything off \\"Damnation\\", which I will review next).  \\"A Fair Judgement\\" is one of my favorite Opeth songs.  It's beautifully melodic and mellow at the beginning.  It keeps building up, while staying melodic, and then coming back down to more mellow parts.  The guitar leads are incredibly beautiful thoughout the whole song.  Truly, this song is gorgeous like few others.  Probably my favorite on the album.  \\"For Absent Friends\\" is a nice, short piece.  It's basically just an acoustic guitar with an electric lead over it, but it gives you that chillingly beautiful feeling all Opeth acoustic songs do.  <br />This album is disgustingly good, but I wouldn't recommend it as your first Opeth album, as it's heaviness may be over powering.  Get \\"Blackwater Park\\" first, and if you like that, immediately buy \\"Deliverance\\" and their newest \\"Damnation\\" (which is incredibly good also.)
B000092ZYX|5.0|If you have been worried about 'Hail To The Thief' living up to the impossibly high standards that only Radiohead can achieve, I'm here to let you know your worries are unfounded. Many complain that Radiohead are oft judged based on the merits/sounds of their previous works, and personally I don't appreciate the rampant \\"'The Bends'/'OK Computer'\\" comparisons made so often when a new album of theirs comes out. Honestly, however, Radiohead are a band which in their own overt way are so far removed from other musicians (although there ARE links if you look hard enough) that they become a specific type of beast, one which can only be put into perspective with their own works ('Pablo Honey', their first effort, notwithstanding). And yes, their new record shares much with the groundbreaking albums which preceded it, 'Kid A' and to a lesser extent 'Amnesiac' with its affinity for computer-generated soundscapes and intricate, methodic pacing.<BR>But it, like Radiohead itself, emerges after several listens to be a beast of its own.<br />In its musical impact, lyrical sentiments and overall relevance HTTT emerges as being their most direct and technically \\"pop\\" record ever, even more so than Pablo Honey. Thom Yorke has always claimed this would be a much more accessible record, and it shows from the first moments in \\"2+2=5.\\" The song is by no means mainstream, lowbrow, or simplistic, yet it resonates with an impact that Radiohead's music (at least recently) hasn't shown. The drum machine at the beginning comes off as nervous, organic, real, rather than cold and frosty as it usually comes across with their music. Yorke's plaintive cries, Jonny Greenwood and Ed O'Brien's guitars, and Colin Greenwood's bass undertones are crisp, dry, immediate. Phil Selway's drums pummel with force. Even though this song has all the intricacy of Kid A and Amnesiac, it carries little of the subtlety. To wit, it hits you like a brick.<br />Rather than giving the record some time to age and unfolditself, HTTT tries to capture a more live, energetic performance of Radiohead's. It resembles the overlooked road album New Adventures in Hi-Fi by REM in that it tries to capture the intensity of the moment. Instrumentation flows naturally into electronic soundscapes. The skitter of electronic pulses on \\"Sit Down Stand Up\\" break perfectly into pounding drums, Yorke's mantra of \\"The Raindrops,\\" and driving, forceful bass. \\"Myxomatosis\\" later on buzzes with all the warmth of a saw, it's towering synth line knocking you hard into your seat, like the relentlessness of the media it chronicles. Yorke has maintained themes of looming darkness, hopelessness, control, fear for our future, and on here they ram them home with the force of importance. While Kid A and Amnesiac were more obscure treatisies on the state of our world and all the paranoia, madness, loss and hope it implies, Hail to the Thief is a (slightly) more focused statement. What they say here, they mean passionately, and they don't want to waste time. This is war, on Radiohead's terms. Pop music forms are a means to the end.<br />This record also takes a direction that other Radiohead records haven't, and gives it further identity: warmth. Camp and even almost sensual mood pieces abound, such as \\"Go to Sleep,\\" \\"We Suck Young Blood,\\" and \\"A Punch-Up at a Wedding,\\" which manages to lay a thick piano and bass guitar groove over vaguely political lyrics. The voice of Yorke is clear, impassioned, and equal parts hissing and soothing. The more wholly electronic experiments, \\"Backdrifts\\" (the best song on here) and \\"The Gloaming\\" benefit from the tones of his voice, the earlier a plea to succeed even as one knows one is doomed to failure, the later an almost Grimm fairy tale style musing on approaching darkness, sung almost mantra-like. People complained about the inclusion of electronic textures before. They will find here how wrong they are: Radiohead have mastered the genre and techniques and prove they can manufacture fantastic compositions no matter what the medium.<br />Overflowing in warmth, purpose, and importance, already it can be seen that this has a strong chance at becoming Album of the Year. With most of Radiohead's records my proper reccomendation if you're wary would be to \\"spend time with it, let it try to grow on you.\\" I have a feeling, though, that if this one doesn't bowl you over on first listen, you probably don't deserve the pleasure of appreciating good music. There's too much here to be stuck nay-saying. Either hop on board or get out of the way.
B00008MZ0N|2.0|There's something to be said about a culture that can release more of a movie than you can shake a stick at. (I believe Halloween I is gearing up for its 5th or 6th DVD release.) Theres even more to be said of the consumers that buy them. Here's an idea... F&F ver 3.0 Ja Rule edition complete with never before seen video and omitting all the documentaries. I started buying DVD's from day one and I remember when there was something special about a &#34;special edition.&#34; Heck... I remember when Deleted scenes were actually added back into the movie or you could pick the original theatre or re-edited cut. Those days are over and almost every disk is &#34;special.&#34;  This &#34;turbocharged edition&#34; was poorly planned and put together, and comes off as one big Mitsubishi commercial (since they sponsor the sequel.) Most disappointing is all the documentary and behind the scenes erased from Version 1. And I mean ALL. The marketing wiz behind this must have thought sequel and disk in the same month and these idiots will buy.  The prelude to 2F2F isnt bad, but forgets a key factor in that Brian, our hero, lived in the back of the shop he worked at but does set up the scene. Featured here are the GTO (3000 GT here in the States) and the Eclipse. Perhaps they'd do better to show this instead of those jazzy commercials on TV.  &#34;All New Movie Experience?&#34; The Multi-angle, Deleted scenes, and behind the scenes footage are only accessible through a re-done &#34;commentary sans Vin Diesel&#34; when an icon appears (basically a behind the scenes alternate shot, even porn has true multi-angle). I love listening to the commentary but to force others who may not want to watch an entire movie with voice over to see missing scenes? Some arent even missing, they're actually on the scene ride show-offs. The &#34;And much more&#34; they advertised... um... I must have missed it.  Tricking out a Hot Car: Oh, the Lancer Evolution is in the states now and in the sequel... sonow we have a Lancer EVO commercial complete with playmate of the year. Sadly she cant even &#34;act&#34; stupid without coming off like shes acting. Don't do this at home (that goes for the playmate too) kids and, if you do, dont expect to have your car pass for plate tags.  The big marketing point is hilarious. A coupon for a free ticket woth less than what you just bought.  This version could have been great. If they had taken the original DVD release, added the deleted scenes separately, and then piled on the &#34;tricked out edition extras&#34; it would be worth it. As is it isn't even worth replacing your 1st Gen release... that is unless you're a big fan of MMC.
B000099T3P|4.0|Seriously, what more could you ask for? Gremlins, Back to the Future, Ghostbusters, The Goonies and yes....CRITTERS! While most may disagree, I loved Critters. You find yourself caring about the characters, even the dirty sister up in the barn. And get this...the acting is good too! The effects arent all that bad either, you gotta realize this was made in 1985 and released in 86'. Definatly pick these movies on DVD, they arent confusing either, they all have connection to the previous one. Unlike those Leprechaun films. Infact, part 3 is \\"to be continued\\" and the series is finished off in the far future in part 4. It gets real serious in part 4 and the series ends with a huge surprize twist. Get these DVDs on August 5th. I know I am.
B000065U1N|5.0|This movie ranks up there with Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, Platoon and Saving Private Ryan as one of the best war depictions I have ever seen. This horrible true story tells the tale of a combined operation with Rangers and Delta Force that went wrong. Also shows how the UN can be very difficult to work with in a war situation. The acting in this movie is beyond excellent with a great cast. The music also adds to the drama with a combination of upbeat western movie music and arabic/muslim music to fit the mood of the area of Somalia. This is a must see for anyone and should be considered one of the greatest war movies of our time with Saving Private Ryan.
B00006G8O1|1.0|Rented this terrible movie. What a depressing movie, if<BR>anyone was contemplating suicide this one would put you over<BR>the edge! The music is so disturbing, and the concept of<BR>this movie is not understandable. Patrick Swayze will never<BR>live this movie down.And Drew Barrymore what was she thinking?<BR>Disturbing is the word for it.
B000001C6M|5.0|This album deserves 5 just for being the debut of one of the best bands ever! Great album!!!
0790729725|1.0|Whats up with this horrible dvd the box claim enhanced for widescreen tv's but it is not! and the movie is split in two on both sides of the disk! not to mention very bad picture quality. They need to fix this problem.
1557486603|5.0|I am a mother and Grandmother ( seven children and eleven Grandchildren)  I think Eleanor Porter should have an extra star in her crown in heaven for her splended writings of Pollanna and for the insperation other authors gained by her work. ( I read the series a friend of mine had when I was a young girl)  That was many years ago. I am sixty nine years old now and I have been searching for many years for all the Pollyanna books to give to my daughters and granddaughters. Now with my PC I have been able to find what I had looked for so many years.  I hesitate to think what kind of person would not like or gain from her books.  I am \\"glad\\" that I can find things in my daily life to be \\" glad \\"about.  Carrie
1565847873|3.0|I love the other books of the series but this one is not as good. I noticed a couple of mistakes in the plot like when Wallendar cut his knee in one of the last chapters and then there was no mention to that again in the rest of the book, or when he was paying a hotel and noticed he had enough money to spent more days but a few minutes later he had no money to pay for gasoline and then at the end he changed money..I was just confused specially because the other books are flawless...
B000002N3N|5.0|Enya is such a wonderful artist, truly given a gift from God!! Every song on this album is a delight to listen to. \\"Once You Had Gold\\" is a song I'm actually using in a fanfiction story I'm writing, and I hardly ever do \\"songfics.\\" But this song is so beautiful and poignant and angsty that it fits perfectly with the message I'm trying to get across.<br />Other special favorites are the title song, Anywhere Is, Athar Ar Neamh, China Roses . . . Okay, let's just say the whole album is a classic!!! I'm not really into new age music, but Enya is different! You will not go wrong buying her albums, and especially this one is a must-have!!
B00008LDPU|5.0|I really like this set of films.  The website really provided a good idea of what kind of things to respect.  The first three films were written by the Wachowski Brothers and deal with the films directly like what happened to the Osiris and why that boy always follows Neo around.  The rest of the films range from wonderful (Detective Story) to down right freaky (matriculated), but absolutely great.  I would highly recommend this for any anime fan and fan of the Matrix.  And, if you didn't like Reloaded, don't worry, this is much cooler!
0446605409|4.0|Plum Island was an entertaining, enjoyable book - filled with subplots and multiple storylines that keep the reader engaged.  The novel follows John Connor, a New York City police detective who is spending time on the north shore of Long Island recovering from wounds sustained on the job.  He is pulled into the investigation of the double murder of a couple he was acquainted with.  As the story unfolds, Corey must test his physical abilities and emotional ties to the case while using his intellect, inquisitiveness, and decisiveness to outwit the forces arrayed against him as he seeks to solve this crime.  Told in the first person from Corey's perspective, DeMille provides a humorous (in a sarcastic, deadpan sort of way) character that has depth and likeability.  Plum Island was worth my time.
0393057658|5.0|This is an entertaining book that brings to life the world of baseball general management.  I believe the book's value comes from the behind-the-scenes account it provides, not from its study of Billy Beane's strategy.<br />Beane's objective strategy is not all that revolutionary (it's not like he discovered on-base percentage); however, his devotion to it probably is.  The reader is lead to believe this devotion explains why the A's have continued to play great baseball despite the annual loss of mega-stars such as Johnny Damon, Jason Giambi, Miguel Tejada, and Billy Koch.  However, the book's weakness is the absence of any account of the Big 3 pitchers (Hudson, Mulder, and Zito), who are probably more responsible for the A's success than is Beane's philosophy.<br />I do like the book's optimistic conclusion: that it's possible to win by finding hidden gems on the cheap instead of paying proven players enormous sums of money.  Beane believes the key is letting statistical analysis drive decisions as opposed to gut, emotional, commonplace intuition.  By remaining objective, Beane hopes to keep himself from getting too wrapped up in a player and, thus, overpaying for him.  This sounds an awful lot like investments, and with Michael Lewis' background, there's not doubt that's what he had in mind.  For example, a stock's price/earnings ratio can be likened to a player's on-base percentage/annual salary.<br />The book is humorous and well-written.  My favorite line was when Beane's scouts' questioned the body type of a player he was gung-ho about drafting and he responded &quot;hey, we're not selling jeans here.&quot;  Lines like that and a fast pace makes this a thoroughly enjoyable book.
B000021YQV|5.0|WOW! Do these guys play all their instruments with sledgehammers? Super-percussive, attention getting loudness supreme! SOAD gives new meaning to the words 'rhythm guitar.'<BR>The first time my girlfriend played it (way too loud) I thought I would be annoyed. But my head was a-bang long before Chop Suey or Toxicity or any of the more popular tunes.<BR>It's nice to see these local guys make good.<BR>Rock-us, dudes!

B00009NDAF|5.0|You have to ask yourself simply.... Do you want to win? If you do then read this book. There is no book comparable to this one. No other autobiography does a better job of distilling the attitudes needed to win, the criteria for evaluating what really are issues confronting you and the behaviors needed to set into motion the winds of change. You can customize the learnings in this book to suit you if you lead a team of six men or if you lead an organization of six hundred thousand. Typically books like these touch on three aspects of corporate life: Information, Knowledge and Wisdom. A Manager who understands the functionality of business can write a book that informs. A leader who understands patterns relating to his industry and to management in general can write a book which makes you more knowledgable. This the case for most good business books. But very rarely someone comes along who highlights the guiding principles that define dynamism, creating and managing change and the elements of reinvention. Forget any doubts you may have and pick up this book. It's a solitaire.
B00003CXAT|4.0|How many people haven't heard of it?  In ten years JURASSIC PARK has become a contemporary classic and spawned two sequels.  It's definitely among Spielberg's most fun films ever made and one of my favorites.<br />JURASSIC PARK, adapted from Michael Crichton's runaway best-seller, is the tale of a group of everyday people (including a chaos specialist and two paleontologists) who journey to a Costa Rican island to see the brainchild of John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) - an amusement park that stretches across the entire island and is of yet top secret.  Disney World copy?  Not so, because this amusement park is home to walking, roaring, breathing and hungry dinosaurs.  Emphasis on hungry.<br />The animatronics are perfect, along with Spielberg's always great directing.  Michael Crichton and David Koepp write the suspenseful screenplay from Chrichton's novel; the cast is also very good (especially Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum, who would both return in the sequels), not to mention John Williams' always terrific score.  Williams' score really stands out in this one.<br />JURASSIC PARK is definitely a magnificent film and will continue to entertain us for generations to come.  In fact, it's one of the most entertaining films in years.  But don't listen to me jabber about it.  Go see this wonderous thriller for yourself.<br />OVERALL: 4 [Nearly a Masterpiece] out of 5 [Perfect]
B00008OWZC|5.0|This LIVE album merely confirms the obvious - Led Zeppelin are the greatest hard rock act of all time and for good reason.  This music is absolutely brilliant - raw, immediate and awe-inspiring.  Its a wonderful feeling knowing there once existed four musicians who came together and formed one of the greatest sounds in music.  And thats what this LIVE album manages to capture - a sound that is heavy and hard, yet soft and subtle - the Led Zeppelin sound.  To quote Jimmy himself \\"light and shade\\".  These guys found the perfect balance between heavy music and subtle tones and delivered it in this wild, sexy and dangerous edge.  <br />However, as wonderful as this album makes me feel, it also inspires feelings of sadness in that I never got a chance to experience what the audience in this release did.<br />Ps...for all new fans or even existing fans who found joy and happiness in this release, then dig a little deeper and try to get yourself bootleg recordings of concerts such as Blueberry hill or Texas International Pop festival, which are truly incredible in their hunger, urgency and conviction. Its  frightening how good Zeppelin played in these two concerts.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I thought it was a great album. All the songs are catchy, well written, don't sound exactly the same, and have an awsome beat. Furthermore, the artists are very sexy. t.A.T.u. is one of my new favorites. I suggest buying this album, it rocks!
B00000099Y|5.0|WOW!! What more is there to say about this album. Solid the whole way through never puts you down for one second. Great combination of lyrics and instruments.This cd has taken rock to another level, a level in which most bands will never reach. The guitar will leave your heart pumping while the drums will get you out of your seat and then of course, MJK's screams and sings his way into your head. Awesome cd cant put it down since the day i bought it in 96.TOOL ROCKS!
B00005JLSE|5.0|This movie was the best i have seen all year! i saw the actual play back in oregon and was so surpised how much better the movie was then the musical. I recomend this movie to all jazz lovers. It is an awesome film and deserves a lot of credit!
B00005B36H|5.0|Here I am listening to people all over the world saying this is tools worst album. Are they crazy!!!!!Nothing happened to tool they just change like everyone else. They've matured in life and that is reflected in this album. Great album you start to get a taste of the awesome guitars riffs in this album and a lot of drumming.Very good album, very dark, and philisophical but still a great album. Great buy for any one who likes to sit and really let music get to you buy what its saying and get an appreciaiton for the sounds.TOOL ROCKS!!
0385504209|5.0|I am about one third into this book, and I am enjoying it tremendously. I have studied art history extensively and would like to comment on Leonardo Da Vinci's name. Leonardo Da Vinci is known both as Leonardo and Da Vinci. Especially in Europe he is known as Da Vinci. I will write more as I finish the book.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|This 34 year old loves this Disney film, which will be a classic.  The animation and music are wonderful.  Definitely a film for the whole family.
0385486804|1.0|I just finished this book even though it's been on my shelf for years. Unfortunately, I found this to be one of the worst books I've read in a while. First off, the story of Chris and his life is extremely skimpy--basically, he was excruciatingly average. Therefore, the author pads the story with entire chapters about himself! Secondly, the writing is atrocious. Krakauer creates whole passages of melodrama, too ridiculous to cite here. Finally, my biggest problem with the book was the lack of conclusions it draws: \\"Was Chris nuts? Was he sane? No one will ever know...\\" erases all the previous efforts the author described to get to the 'soul' of this young man. Bottom line for those curious about Chris and his travels is to look for the OUTSIDE magazine article about him because it offers as much info as the book does and is a lot cheaper and quicker to read.
B00008PX8P|5.0|To those who read what 'The Cranky Reviewer' wrote, please ignore the comment. This cranky person either can't tell who is really talented or he was being sarcastic.<br />This DVD may not have the best picture, but it is really good. Even if you are not a big fan of Led Zeppelin, you will enjoy it, for sure.
B000035Z1Z|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time on a trip, and I have to say it was a greawt movie, It has the same amount of Comedy as it has Romance.  There is never a boring moment in this movie, and I recomend it to any male or female in the mood to laugh and Romance.
B000002TYK|5.0|This is not the best Foo Fighters album, but its still a must buy.  This album is from 1995, most bands from this era aren't even around anymore.  Why have Foo fighters survived?  Because they have been writing great rock songs for 8 years.  They have catchy songs on every album, and every album is FULL of catchy songs.  This album is where it started.  Sure later albums had more &quot;passion&quot;, better lyrics, and higher production values, but thats what makes this album a standout.  It had to be recorded in a week and you can FEEL the urgency in Dave's voice.  buy it.
B000000W4M|5.0|This album is undoubtedly the greatest I have ever heard.  Liked the Smashing Pumpkins before I heard this album, but I absolutely fell in love with them after listening to this album.  Evertime I hear 5 seconds of this album I stop what I am doing and listen to the whole thing.  This album will change your life.  It will help you through the worst times or make the best times even better.

6305949980|5.0|Man o man. Tim Burton is the best. He makes the coolest movies and this is one of them. I own and love this movie. It's about a skellington named Jack Skellington. He is the Pumpkin Kig of Halloween town. Everyone loves him but he starts to get sick of Halloween. He wants some thing new and wonderful. One day he was walking aimlessly in the woods and came to a circle of trees with different holiday doors on them. He opens the Christmas door and and lands in Christmas. He loves it and decides to make a Christmas of his own. It doesn't exactly turn out as he planned and everything goes wrong. You have to see it yourself its an amazing movie.
B00008DDSC|5.0|This is a paradigmatic \\"cult movie.\\"  You'll either love it and run out to buy the DVD, or you'll be some combination of baffled and repulsed.<br />The briefest description I can give is that this movie is sort of what a screwball romantic comedy would be like if it were written by the Marquis de Sade.<br />Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a  \\"cutter\\" (i.e., she inflicts cuts on herself intentionally to deal with the pain and anxiety in her life).  She accidentally cut too deep one time, so her family had her institutionalized.  She has just been released, and is looking for a job, despite having a complete lack of work experience.<br />E. Edward Gray (James Spader) is an attorney.  When Lee shows up to apply for a job at his office, the reception area looks like a battle scene, and the old secretary is leaving in tears.  Gray then asks Lee a series of impertinent questions:  \\"Are you pregnant?  Do you plan on being pregnant? Do you live alone?\\"  She ingenuously answers his questions and is hired that day.<br />Their relationship only gets odder as time goes on.  There is obvious sexual tension between the (virginal, we assume) Lee and the recently divorced Gray.  Step by step, they escalate from intimate boss-employee conversations to out and out BDSM.<br />This bare summary makes the story seem dark and sinister.  But if you have a morbid sensibility, you'll find yourself chuckling at the movie's sly humor, and being touched by the budding romance between Lee and Gray.<br />Spader gives, as usual, a fine performance, but Gyllenhaal is just terrific.  Without her the movie would not work.  She has to seem innocent yet kinky.  She has to believable as a person with serious psychological problems, while having an intoxicating effervescence about her.  She must manifeset subtle and complex expressions in key scenes.  She does it all.<br />One key scene is the first time Gray disciplines Lee.  He humiliates her for a typographical error in a letter she typed, makes her bend over his desk, and then spanks her while forcing her to read the letter out loud.  Gyllenhaal's face and voice capture exquisitely the combination of shock, humiliation and arousal that the scene requires.  When Gray is finished spanking Lee, he leans forward over her, obviously spent from his effort.  His hand is next to hers, and her pinky reaches out to grasp his hand, a subtle indication of the intimacy that they have shared.<br />This intimacy is important, because it becomes clear that the relationship between Gray and Lee is not just about kinky sex.  They are in love, and they need each other.  But will the relationship work out?  Ironically, although Gray is the \\"Dom,\\" he is the one who needs Lee to guide him by her submission.  But doing so requires that he trust her enough to open up to her.<br />And, yes, it's also a comedy.  Trust me.<br />The movie is based on a fine short story, \\"Secretary,\\" by Mary Gaitskill, in her collection _Bad Behavior_, which is a great read (although much darker than this movie).kes her bend over his desk, and then spanks her while forcing her to read the letter out loud.

B00008S2VG|5.0|I've already done a review of this album, and I'm going to do another one.  After playing it a couple times, I found the best way to experience it completely is to listen to it on headphones with a really good sound system.  This album was mixed extremely well and edited to perfection.  The rap at the end of \\"Mother and Father\\" is brilliant, (hint: blast it with earphones). \\"American Life\\" dares to use instrumentation that mixes new technology of techno grooves with basic accoustic riffs that amazingly blend well together.  Innovation that works. The final highlight of this cd in my oppinion is \\"Nothing Fails\\".  It's become one of my all-time favourite Madonna songs that almost surpasses \\"Inside of Me\\".  Strange how even some Madonna fans don't appreciate this album.  Whatever Heather!!!!!!
B000002KD9|5.0|Harvest may have been bigger,but ATGR is a deeper ,more introspective album.Certainly inspired by his tenure in CSNY,their influence is as prevelent as his was on their Deja Vu album.Besides the classics(the title track,Southern Man,Don't Let It Bring You Down)there are acoustic nuggets(Birds,I Believe In You)that would've enhanced the somewhat schitzophrentic Harvest.For those who are only Harvest fans,give ATGR a listen and you'll feel you have stuck it rich.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|Ok, I admit I am such a kid myself.  I collect almost every Disney video there is but this has to be one of my all time favorites. My son who is four watches this over and over again. We get such the giggles and it is fun to sit down and snuggle with him and watch it. My husband even liked it, but don't let him know i told you.  Billy Crystal and John Goodman are the greatest.
B00004S35Z|5.0|For an album that a)was a Billboard #1 hit b)won tons of Grammies including album of the year,FFF was released on CD in 1988 with not only a shoddy sound but the insert wasn't even a booklet,but a sheet with liner notes but no lyrics on one side and the cover reduced and surrounded with an orange border on the other.Now FFF has been given the respect it deserves, as well as remastered with a brighter,crisper sound whereas it sounded like it was being channeled through an AM radio.Boogie On Reggae Woman staccato synth bassline no longer sounds like a scratched record,while \\"Heaven is 10 Zillion Light Years Away \\"sound as transcending as its title promises.Bird Of Beauty benefits the most with its Latin-esque elements sonically at the forefront. Creepin' is more seductive than ever and no longer sounds like a Classic IV clone.  FFF's remastering, along with his other \\"Power 70s Albums\\"(Music Of My Mind, Talking Book, Innervisions and Songs In The Key Of Life) is a godsend to Stevie fans who've had to put up with chopped up album sleeves,lost lyrics and fourth generation master sound unbefitting to these state of the art recordings during their initial releases.
B00008R9KF|5.0|I've been waiting a very long time to be able to add Stephen Frears' wonderful, independent film \\"My Beautiful Laundrette\\" to my DVD collection. I'm overjoyed to once again view this well written, 'slice of life' comedy/drama. The movie casts a sharp and critical, socio-political, eye on Margret Thatcher's England of the 1980's.In the film we meet Omar (Gordon Warnecke) a young man, who is a poor relation to a wealthy Pakistani family, living in England.Omar's rather  unscrupulous, Uncle (Saeed Jaffrey)decides to do him a favor and take him into the family business.He allows Omar to make a go of an old, broken down, laundrette, which is blithley described as a \\"toilet\\".At first Omar seems quiet, polite and attenative. But as the film goes on we find out, that he is quite a character. He isn't one to just push a broom around and watch the laundrette fail.He has big dreams for both the establishment and his financial future.Omar enlists the help of his white, working class, pal and gay lover, Johnny (brilliantly played by a young, Daniel Day-Lewis)to make the future happen now.Together the two craftily (and illegally) finance and fix up, what can only be described as the 'Disneyland' of Laundrettes.Director,Stephen Frear's movie humoursly presents Omar's speedy rise into the business world.But it is also rather melancholic in tone and touches on a variety of serious subjects, which includes everything from politics to race relations to economic policy. The cast of the movie is fantastic and the standouts include Saeed Jaffrey as Omar's amoral, Uncle Nasser and Roshan Seth as his socialist, alcholic father. Daniel Day-Lewis is superb in his star making, nuanced performance as a gay, working class, tough guy.The DVD remaster of the film is adequate, but has little in extras. It is a movie that is just begging for a director's commentary!\\"My Beautiful Laundrette\\" is a wonderfully entertaining film, which leaves the viewer with plenty to think about. Highly recommended!
B000002UB3|5.0|If any album could be labeled a glorious swan song,Abbey Road wins hands down.Consciencly knowing the end was near and not wanting the aborted Get Back(later to be retitled Let It Be) to be their epitath,Abbey Road is The Beatles going out in style.Although the atmosphere was the same as the the white album and Get Back recording sessions,the group bit the bullet and played as a well oiled unit.Though still writing songs outside the group,they displayed each writer at the top of their game.John's Come Together and I Want You(she's so heavy) are the best individual tracks on the album as well as George's Something and Here Comes The Sun,showing him rising in the ranks of the songwriting pool.Paul on the other hand is the one responsible for the medley production of the latter half of the album.Because displays the sweet vocal harmonies thats crops up all over the album thats been buried on previous albums.Ringo's self composed Octopus's Garden,although a re-write of Yellow Submarine,is cute and whimsical.Although it would take a half of year for the group to disband,they topped off their rich musical legacy with this class act of an album.

B00004S367|5.0|The dark horse of Stevie Wonder's &quot;70s Power Albums&quot;,MOMM is a more experimental album.Though not given classic status like it's predecessors,it established Stevie as a major artist.For year it has been revered,yet its CD release in 1988 has been shoddy with sub-par sound(a travisty considering it was recorded at circa-1971 state of the art studios like Electric Lady) as well as reduced packaging(no lyrics,truncated cover)usually treated as a budget line product.Now MOMM has been remastered in crisp clean digital sound that brings out a clarity that probably hasn't been heard since its been mastered all those years ago.Happier Than The Morning Sun finally sounds as bright as its title indicates,while the funky clavinets of Love Having You Around and Keep On Running sounds as sweaty and sinister as they would on Superstition.Superwoman(Where Were You When I Needed You), already previewed on At The Close Of A Century,benefits the most with its errie yet mournful synth lines enhanced.Lost since the vinyl format has been phased out,is the original gatefold collage as well as the lyrics.MOMM, although dense and experimental,is now a new listening experience like when you first laid the needle down for the first time back in '72 and heard all these new sounds and textures in Stevie's music.
B00009ATKS|5.0|I can't think of many bands in contemporary music being as underrated as Mogwai have been. This band has been so underlooked it's ridiculous.<BR>    These Scots are now four albums deep and they dont seem to be letting up at all. Quite the contrary i would say!<BR>     \\"Happy songs....\\" is a stark antithesis compared not only to their previous \\"Rock action\\" but also to their epic \\"Come on die young\\". The difference here is that Mogwai have shifted into a soundscape of melancholic and often downright depression-laden instrumental tunes that sound, as a sum, like the best album Radiohead never made.<BR>     It's kinda bizzare not to hear the sudden angry explosions characteristic of Mogwai's former albums, but at the same time this one incredible listen.<BR>     It's also dripping with irony and sarcasm already starting with the title of the LP (Happy songs for happy people) because, trust me, this is anything but happy and it's intended for people who are if not majorly unhappy then at the very least alarmingly concerned.<BR>    All this amounts to a very welcome change from the group, not an fan-alienating change but sort of a new direction.<BR>   Being that this is Mogwai there's no telling whether they'll stick to this formula, after all, they've accustomed us to wild and incredible rock experimentations as if their music is made in some lab out there in the Highlands.<BR>    This band have been gaining in following as they've progressed and they have done it without any major company promo, without any pushing from the mags and with insignificant airplay.<BR>   What does this say? It says a lot and it spells \\"indie\\" if that term does somehow still exist in the rock scene.<BR>   Amazingly, Scotland keeps coming up with all these gems of bands (Aereogramme, Arab Strap, to name a few) that have more to say in their rock statements that some of the blockbuster names being shoved down our throats as \\"rock heroes\\" combined ever have.<BR>    If you have committed the inexcusable crime of not having discovered these gorgeous noisemakers please do. Urgently. You have been cheated.
B000002KCC|5.0|Please Take My Advice...To truly understand the brilliance of Neil Young,take a listen to this brilliantly, uncompromising piece of work.Tonight's The Night is the most brutal look at excess and its consequences.The heavy-lidded,lethargic feel is no act.After the drug induced deaths of two friends,this music was at the same time both a mourning as well as an outlet.The album plays like a raw pulse which struggles to stay alive,yet won't die.The title tracks(!)play like an after hours lament,and Borrowed Tune sounds elegently wasted.Tired Eyes is the centerpiece,reminding us of the consequences that goes with associating with drugs.Even the lighter moments(Mellow My Mind,New Mama)plays like the mood is somber.If you like Harvest and don't like TTN,it shows you don't fully understand Neil Young.And like many dark pieces,you may not like it,but you won't ignore it
B000066NW0|5.0|I Love this album.I've been listening to it for months and it hasn't got boring.I loved her first single complicated and her album is just as great.Here's how i rate the songs:<br />1.Losing grip: 8 and a half out of 10 ,a really good song<BR>2.Complicated: 10/10 really catchy<BR>3.Sk8er Boi: 6 and a half out of 10, liked it alot at first but gets boring after a while, still good track<BR>4.

Mobile: 8 and a half out of 10: i love this song, really catchy<BR>6.Unwanted:7/10, wasn't to keen on this song at first but i've grown to really like it, definitely one of the heavier songs on this album.<BR>7. Tomorrow: 8/10, i really like this song, a great ballad<BR>8. Anything but ordinary: 10/10, this is such a great song really catchy with good lyrics<BR>9.Things i'll never say: 9/10, probably my fave slower song (with a bit of pop) on the album<BR>10. My World: 9/10, really nice pop song,which gives you an idea of her backround<BR>11. Nobody's fool: 6/10,A good song ,not so keen on the small bit of rapping but a good chorus<BR>12. Too Much to ask: 7/10,  a nice song about a boyfriend<BR>13.Naked: 8/10, Really good song, slower song but at the same time quite punk/rock<br />I would definitely recommend this album.*****
B000002UB6|5.0|This may not be The Beatles greatest recording moment,but it holds up very well despite all the bashing its gotten over the years.Started January 1969 as Get Back,the original idea was to record an album aux natural with as little of the production values that has graced their latter albums(Sgt Pepper,MMT,the white album).Unfortunatly the tedious task of sifting through the many hours of tape,along with the recording of Abbey Road,left this project on the shelf.Nearly a year later,it was unshelved and attempted to be mixed by Glyns Johns,which proved unsucessful.Enter Phil Spector who went against the &quot;live in the studio&quot; concept and made a presentable product.Retitled Let It Be,it proved to be a fitting title as The Beatles disbanded a month before its release date.As for the album itself,Spector's touches gaves these recording a much needed polish.In light of the outtakes which surfaced on Anthology 3,the aux natural concept would not go easy on record buyers ears.A great song even in its raw form,The Long And Winding Road,although a bit overproduced,is very stirring.while Across The Universe in Spectors hands,is transformed into the albums highlight.The title track works better in its single mix,due to the Spector overdub seem to stiffle the track.George Harrison's two compositions,I Me Mine and For You Blue,are strong indications of his later work on Abbey Road and his own All Things Must Pass.Dig A Pony,I've Got a Feeling and One After 909,although rough rockers,shows the group in fine form.Two Of Us shows for one last time,the classic chemestry between Lennon And McCartney.The rooftop performance of Get Back ends the album with Lennon stating &quot;I hope we passed the audition&quot;.Although many criticized this album for what its not(especially coming after Abbey Road)it shows the group as they are at the time,fragmenting all the while still making great music.

B00000JLWW|5.0|Okay, the DVD is a bit dissapointing for a film of this magnitude (it is the highest grossing film nation-wide and WORLD-wide to date!!), however, the movie itself is simply stunning!!  Titanic is STILL (after all these years) one of my favorite movies.  From the moment I first saw it in the theaters I knew that this film was \\"special\\".  Very few movies have been able to leave me in *awe* minutes, and even HOURS after watching them.  However Titanic takes the cake.  It touched so many people of many different ages, backgrounds, races, genders, etc...that it's completely a phenomenon.  I don't know many people who have NOT seen this movie, or who have not at least HEARD of the movie \\"Titanic\\". This movie was able to capture the horrific incident of what actually happened on April (15th was it??) 1912.  The attention to historical detail, and accuracy is where I really give James Cameron two thumbs up!  If only you KNEW how much hard work and effort went into making this film as accurate as possible, I don't think that half of the negative comments would be on this board today. Even the actors in the film actually LOOKED like some of the REAL historical figures on that ship!  The resemblance is uncanny!  They went out of their way to find GOOD actors who actually resembled those historical people.<br />I think those that criticize this movie to no end have really REALLY missed the point of this film.  Before this film came out, I had only read about the Titanic disaster in books in elementary school!  After that, I didn't pay a single bit of attention to it,neither did I fully grasp just how AWFUL this tragedy was.  I couldn't really put myself in an event that had happened way before even my grandmother was born!  hahah..  HOWEVER, after seeing Titanic...I now have a deeper appreciation for the lives that were lost and for the ship itself. I literally cried during some of the end parts of this movie.  It really made me think.  \\"What would I have done if I were in this similar situation??\\"  LEt's face it, this movie touched lives...many people.<br />I think that the people who incessantly bash this movie are just doing so because it was so huge.his similar situation??\\"  LEt's face it, this movie touched lives...many people.  <br />I think that the people who incessantly bash this movie are just doing so because it was so huge.
B00003CXI1|5.0|It is really quite amazing that a major motion picture not only remained very faithful indeed to Rowling's original novel but actually succeeded very well in recreating the magical scenery and extraordinary environment of Hogwarts. The special effects in the movie are, on the whole, fantastic, a fact which becomes obvious upon Harry's first entrance into the Great Hall. Most amazing of all may be the spectacular presentation of the game of Quidditch. While almost all of Rowling's descriptions in the novel come leaping off the page, it is a little difficult to get a real picture of Quidditch in one's head; thanks to the movie, my days of struggling to really visualize the game as it is played are a thing of the past. There are a couple of occasions upon which the special effects look just a tad hokey, but the overall effect of the film is so magical that I'm not complaining. Indeed, I find it quite refreshing indeed to see a film follow the author's original words and scenes so faithfully; there were minor adjustments to the story along the way, and in a couple of cases the changes actually proved more effective than the original scene would have played on the big screen. The cast is excellent up and down the line. Daniel Radcliffe is Harry Potter as far as I'm concerned, but I was even more impressed by Rupert Grint as Ronald Weasley and Emma Watson (my favorite) as the incomparable Hermione Granger. Richard Harris' brilliant performance as Albus Dumbledore will be sorely missed in future films. I would be remiss to forget Robbie Coltrane's critical contribution as the one and only Hagrid, but by far the most effective job is done by Alan Rickman, whose performance as Professor Snape ranks among the most impressive acting jobs I've ever seen.<br />Everybody knows the plot of the movie by now. The only weakness in this epic production comes in the form of snippets and scenes from Rowling's novel that were not included - this is understandable, as the movie runs a good two and a half hours as it is. The ending seems to come up just a little short, yet it is quite enjoyable as it is. A few plot points that reveal more about some of the key characters can only be found in the book, but the fact that they are most important in terms of what they betoken for future novels and movies makes them a little less than crucial for this first Harry Potter motion picture. Overall, as a full-grown adult clinging to what few fancies of youth he has left, I have to say I loved every minute of this movie. Its commitment to Rowling's vision is to be commended, and there can be no doubt that there are bigger and better adventures yet to come in both book and movie form.<br />The DVD features are, at least to a certain point, rather fun to mess around with, but they probably appeal more to young people than adults. I for one began to grow a little bored after touring Hogwarts, but the fact is that anything on top of the movie itself is just a bonus. I've watched Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone several times now, and I have enjoyed it greatly each and every time.d two and a half hours as it is.

1878424319|4.0|The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz is a short book that has the possibility of effecting people for a lifetime.<br />Ruiz reflects upon and applies the wisdom from the Toltec people-scientists and artists who make it a way of life to simultaneously explore and continue the spiritual, sacred practice and guidance of their ancestors.<br />He explains that we unconsciously \\"agree\\" with the information, the cultural beliefs and training, that is handed to us by others which we then make into our own personalized paradigm which Ruiz refers to as \\"The Book of the Law.\\"  This \\"Book of the Law\\" shapes \\"Your Dream\\" which is what you experience in day-to-day life.<br />The way to break the disempowering bonds of your life is with these simple four agreements which he sets out like this:<br />1. Be Impeccable with Your Word<br />2. Don't Take Anything Personally<br />3. Don't Make Assumptions<br />4. Always Do Your Best<br />My favorite quote from the book, to sort of give you a flavor for the writing is this: \\"Just to breathe is enough for us to always be happy, to enjoy life.\\"<br />Implementing the Four Agreements is when you will realize it is NOT as simple as it seems.<br />An excellent, thought provoking book which you can take as deeply as you desire.  It WILL change your life if you are willing to stick to the Agreements.
B000002LCX|3.0|Who are these reviewers saying that this is the best Smiths album?  Have they heard any other Smiths album?  My guess- no.  Anyone who owned (and likely wept to) The Queen is Dead can immediately recongnize the undeniable superiority of that album.. Having said that, this is still an fine collection of music. But the best- really, get over it.

This compilation should not be called \\"The Best Of\\" without tracks like the strangely omitted \\"Perfect Lover\\", \\"Silhouettes in Disguise\\", and \\"All I Wanted\\".<br />The remastered recording sound very good, and the additional tracks are welcome, but more could have been done to fill this disc even with just CBS/Sony era music.<br />If one wants a nice taste of Kansas, this would be a good pick up along with the discounted \\"Power\\" album.

B00005B4GU|5.0|The sheer brilliance of hail to the thief had me rushing back to this record and only now i'm really starting to appreciate it. Without question, it is best taken from start to finish without skipping any tracks just like Ok C, Kid A and HTTT. One of the songs that i've seriously changed my mind about is the opener which i had regarded as a lesser everything in its right place but now hear it better as a similar type of song sure but lyrically moving in a different direction with a amazing vibe. favourite on album. Hunting Bears is actually a very interesting instrumental and v underated. Pulk/Pull is another i now enjoy a great deal and is extremely well placed between 2 earnest melodic stunners. i now even like Morning bell which again suits the flow of the record and although is a much simpler version than KIDa's amazing version it adds to this record in a different way. So i got this one a bit wrong and thought i'd share my thoughts cos i know from reading the reviews loads of folk think there are some skippable ones on here. WILL LAST - another classic.

0345413377|5.0|The His Dark Materials series really comes to a breathtaking ending in Philip Pullman's The Amber Spyglass.  At first these books may seem a little hard to keep up with but once you start understanding what things are you start to really enjoy the books and get excited about them.  <br />This series really gives the reader to think about something after reading the books.  Even after the series is over you will find yourself thinking and wondering about the stories days after you have read them.  Everything goes fast paced in the story leaving hardly enough time to even think about what's going on and when eventually the story is over you find yourself wishing it wasn't over.  I liked the story so much I found myself reading exciting parts over and finding even more hidden meanings that make me think.<br />The Amber Spyglass and the rest of the His Dark Materials series turned out to be one of my favorite series's of all time.  I find myself thinking of the characters and reliving events in my mind over and over throughout the day.  It's kind of funny how after you read a good book or watch a good movie you always seem to be thinking about the story days afterwards.  <br />I hope this review was of help.  <BR>READ HIS DARK MATERIALS!!!!
B00009P1O2|5.0|I have been to 5 Queen concerts at Madison Square Garden since the release of \\"A Day at the Races\\" the last being the \\"Hot Space\\" tour. I've always said that Queen was the greatest live band of my time and possibly of all times. This release by Hollywood records proves me right! It was alway my dream to see Queen perform in one of the world's most famous venues (Wembley) but unfortunately that never happened, so I have to settle for second best. This DVD has the entire concert in DTS 5.1 and PCM sound format and then some! It has footage of Queen in rehearsal, tracks from the first concert at Wembley,new interviews with Brian and Roger (No Deacon), and interviews with their tour Manager Gerry Stickells and concert Director Gavin Taylor. Going back to the Main Event, Queen coasts through almost every one of their greatest hits (No Sombody to Love)and the audience's participation is something to see. Freddie always said he wrote music for the audience to escape into and have fun with, and boy is the audience having a great time. Freddie leads the audience with some impressive vocal scales and the audience responds with equally impressive scales, the audience participates in hand clapping songs such as Radio GaGa (in the tradition of the video),We will Rock You, then as usual the audience goes crazy with Bohemian Rhapsody.<BR>The band also does interesting covers of Hello Mary Lou, Your So Square, Tutti Frutti, Gimme Some Lovin. <BR>I think anyone who appreciates great music, whether you are a Queen fan or not, should give this Gem of a concert a look.<BR>Queen wrote \\"Who Wants to Live Forever?\\" and answered the question with this performance.
B000002UUX|5.0|Rust in Peace is, without a doubt, the pinnacle of Megadeth's work.<br />More importantly, however, is the fact that it is, in my opinion, the zenith of American heavy metal.<br />Britain had its Judas Priest, Black Sabbath, and Iron Maiden. The United States has Megadeth and, more specifically, Rust in Peace.<br />Every track on this album is appropriate. I play classical piano, so I have a pretty good idea about what great music sounds like, and Rust in Peace is great music. In my CD collection, I place it next to my Bach and Chopin. Each song is a masterpiece.<br />The first track - Holy Wars... The Punishment Due - is timeless. If I could take any non-classical song and translate it to classical piano, I would take Holy Wars. With several different movements, this song is complete; it is epic. Fast, hard, and full of empotion, it will rivet you.<br />Hangar 18, the second track, is proof of Megadeth's musical maturity. With its movements and ripping solos, this song is as close to Beethoven as heavy metal gets.<br />Take No Prisoners, the following track, is hard-hitting and full of power. This is a song you head-bang to. This is a song that even a classical pianist can head-bang to.<br />Five Magics is monumental. Starting off slow, it explodes with a cacaphony of delight.<br />Poison Was The Cure and Lucretia are both great metal songs, complex and well-crafted. The composition on this album is very mature. Dawn Patrol is a nice experiment.<br />Rust in Peace...Polaris, the final track, is hard and fast. Very rhythmic. I love it.<br />If I were an Egyptian pharaoh and could only bury one item with me in my pyramid to take to the afterlife, I would bury Rust in Peace with me.
0714843377|5.0|Fantastic. Amazing. Tremendous.    This book sold out 20 copies in 2 hours at Hennesey + Ingalls Art and Architecture bookstore in Santa Monica. Buy this book if you just graduated art school. Buy this book if you've been in the business for 20 years. Paul Arden will literally change your career and life.
B000092ZYX|2.0|Unfortunately Radiohead may have gone a little too far this time. On hearing this album for the first time I wasn't impressed. On saying that I never go on first impressions of an album but on listening to it again for a second and third time something seems missing. There are a few higlights that remind you of songs past such as 'Go to Sleep' &amp; 'There There'. It feels like I have to work to hard at understanding and liking this album. Gone are the days of Thom Yorke's powerful whining in tune. Now he sounds like a choir boy hitting puberty! And to finish off I'm not impressed by the album cover artwork compared with previous masterpieces.
B00008YLV2|4.0|I purchased this film having not seen it. I made the decision based on friends' recommendations for the most part. Upon watching it, I felt about the same as most of them did, that it was a good film.<br />While watching the film, I continually kept thinking, &quot;This really happened.&quot; I think that adds a bit to the movie's credibility. I knew the stories of many of the soldiers, especially the fate of Sgts Shugart and Gordon, both of which posthumously received the Congressional Medal of Honor, the only snipers ever to have received the highest military award.<br />This film is filled with star power, although most of the time during the action sequences, you can't really tell who's who. The 'Fog of War' came through loud and clear, especially when american soldiers took shots at each other, not knowing who the other was.<br />The film gives a home theatre system a pretty good workout, with lots of exercise for the surrounds. That's definitely something I look for in a movie is surround usage, and this one didn't disappoint. The video quality is excellent, and the 2hr 24 minute runtime isn't too long to sit and watch in one sitting.<br />The subject matter is a bit much for younger viewers, as it can be pretty graphic at times. I wouldn't suggest anyone under 14 or 15 be allowed to watch it, even with parents present.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Some observations about the film trilogy so far:<br />The total length of the harcover trilogy (not including introductions and appendixes) is 1032 pages.<br />The Fellowship of the Ring - 397 pages<BR>The Two Towers             - 340 pages<BR>The Return of the King     - 295 pages<br />Jackson's first film (\\"Fellowship\\") covered all 397 pages of book one (skipping the Old Forest and Tom Bombadil scenes, which did not bother me) and about 10 pages from (the book) \\"The Two Towers\\", for a total movie \\"page count\\" of 407 pages.<br />This film, however, covers only 221 pages of (the book) \\"The Two Towers\\".  It still requires about 220 minutes in this extended edition to cover only a little more than half the written material covered in the first film.<br />This leaves a total of 404 pages (from \\"The Two Towers\\" and \\"The Return of the King\\" combined) to be covered in the third film.  <br />The reason for the small amount of the trilogy covered in this film is evident in the Theatrical Version...a single chapter in the book (The battle of the Hornburg/Helm's Deep) takes over an hour of the film.  This is not a bad thing...but there will have to be a tradeoff.<br />The book \\"The Return of the King\\" includes an even bigger battle (Pelennor Fields)...will it get an hour?  It should...but it's hard to imagine how even just the most critical scenes not yet covered will all fit in the final film!<br />In his audio commentary on the extended DVD version of \\"Fellowship\\" (which is a must listen!), director Jackson reveals he will *not* be including the final battle of the book trilogy (The Scouring of the Shire) in his movie at all, extended or theatrical.  This does bother me.  Without this scene a main theme of the trilogy is lost.  It seems likely that many scenes that occur after the defeat of Sauron will not be included.<br />I can only hope that the extended version of \\"the Return of the King\\" will run 5 hours...it will need to.
B00005KHJR|4.0|I like Sgt. Howie.  Seriously.  I think Edward Woodward, and his character, is sexier than Christopher Lee and his.  Hypothetically, who would you rather be in a relationship with?  A (likely) promiscuous pagan partner given over to wanton lust?  Or a committed and devout man, ready to  hand over his hot-blooded virginity?  When it finally comes to fruition, those repressed Christians are always the hottest in matters of love.  Why do you think there was a seduction attempt (what's with that chick bangin' her hand against the wall?!)?  Why did the townspeople call upon him?  I don't understand the psychology of my fellow critics who act as if he gets what he deserves.  Yeah, let's condemn poor Sgt. Howie for his concern for the missing child, and having an idealistic Christian view of the world.  I suspect it's the pagans still among us who share this opinion.  Personally, I never thought his preaching, if you can call it that, went overboard.  Be forewarned, though:  this film is like a pack of Tarot cards:  beautiful, strange, surreal, mystical, fascinating, intriguing, mysterious, but also like the cards, ultimately terrifying, and evil.
B00008DDXC|4.0|This second Harry Potter outing is an overall better film than the first.  After some initial time spent with his adoptive Muggle parents, Harry escapes to his friend Ron's house, then makes his way to Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for year two of his training.  But not all is well at the school - students are turning up petrified and the teachers are not able to stop it.  Therefore, it's up to Harry, Ron, and Hermione to save the day yet again!<br />The film is better for a number of reasons, not least of which being better source material.  Rowling's 2nd book is smoother and more cohesive, and this comes through in Kloves's screenplay.  Secondly, the children actors are more comfortable in their roles (and the actors playing the adults maintain their high quality).  Unfortunately, Harry himself, Daniel Radcliffe, still seems too standoffish and arrogant relative to his portrayal in the book.  I'm not sure if the blame for this lies with the actor or the director.<br />Thirdly, Director Columbus spends less time admiring the scenery and more time developing the story/characters.  That is not to say that the film is any less dense, but the camera doesn't linger too long, improving the pacing and interest in the story.  Finally, the new characters, including a scenery-chewing turn by Kenneth Branagh as a new prof, and the parents of Ron and Malfoy, are welcome additions to the Potter cast.<br />This DVD edition is likewise far superior to the first film.  Gone are the annoying little games you had to play to access the special features (the annoying games are still there, but they aren't requirements for accessing the goodies).  There are many (19, but mostly short) alternate/cut versions of scenes, an interview with Rowling herself on adapting her books to the screen, and other such extras.  Columbus does not grace us with a director's commentary this time, but I suspect it's unecessary because he covered much territory in the Philosopher's Stone commentary.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|&quot;Donnie Darko&quot; is a dark and intrigueing film from first time writer/director Richard Kelly.  The film is about a troubled teenage boy, named Donnie Darko(Jake Gyllenhaal), that receives visits from a creature that looks like a giant rabbit.  This creature takes Donnie on sleepwalking experiences, and ends up making him do some things he most likely would not have done otherwise.  The creature also relays to Donnie that the world will end in 28 days or so. Donnie has a caring family, however they don't seem very protective at all.  The parents allow the children to curse without ever really getting mad at all.  Then one night, while Donnie is sleepwalking, a 747 jet engine falls through the roof of his bedroom.  The FBI investigates the incident, but finds no answer to where the engine came from.  Donnie also has a psychiatrist(Katherine Ross), who uses hypnosis on Donnie to understand his thoughts, and his actions.<BR>The film then goes on an original, invilving path, that makes the viewer anxious to find out what will happen to it's characters.  Richard Kelly plays fair in allowing little clues here and the as to what will happen later in the film, though I highly doubt much of anyone will be able to figure out before hand what will happen.  Kelly shows talent here, and demonstrates that he can write one heck of a good screenplay.  <BR>The ending to &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; I will not say, but I would like to say that this is no where near a straight forward ending, and even repeated viewings may not solve the puzzle.<BR>&quot;Donnie Darko&quot; has a great young cast.  It features of course Jake Gyllenhaal, who shows some real talent here, and also shows that he is one of the stars of the future.  Also showing talent is Jake sister in real life, and in the film Maggie Gyllenhaal.  She has an odd, mysterious look to her, but shows she has an ability to act, and is leading lady material.  However, my favorite of the bunch is Jena Malone, who plays Donnie's girlfriend.  She has been in earlier films such as &quot;Stepmom&quot; and &quot;Cheaters&quot;, but here she looks beautiful, and gives a beautiful performance.  &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; is a great film, and will have viewers talking, and watching again.
B00006RU5B|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this album.  Chris Cornell's voice is awesome and adds a solid top layer to the intense and full sounds of the band.  Each time I listen to it I enjoy it more.  I am looking forward to see what else they produce in the future.
B000001EXR|5.0|... It's too heavy to be classified as grunge.<br />Objectively, this is a dark album that seems built on the vein of such songs as Unholy, and the Creatures of the Night CD. There's no campy pop metal here. This is not a typical Kiss album, and I recommend it to anyone who likes metal.<br />The first song on the CD, \\"Hate\\", moves almost at breakneak speed, with some killer drumming by Eric Singer. Both Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley finally put together a collection of heavy, well-written songs instead of one or two and then a bunch of filler. Lead guitarist Bruce Kulick (since gone solo), made his vocal debut with \\"I Walk Alone\\" and it also rocks.<br />As a fan of heavy metal music (I'm talking Ozzy, old Metallica - like \\"Master of Puppets\\" & \\"One\\", Black Sabbath (Ozzy years), Motorhead, and the like) I highly recommend this CD to all.<br />It's your problem if you don't like it.
B00008OWZC|5.0|SCRUMTRILESCENT...many of you out there may be saying, what would be worthy of a brand new word? Well this CD(s) is.  The moment I put it in my car CD Player and Immigrant Song came on, I was hooked.  I am officially going out and giving this CD a record ******.  I was an ordinary fan of Led Zeppelin, as a 16 year old who of course didnt grow up in the 70s, was transformed.  All the Zeppelin stuff I have heard was the early and later days of Led Zep and had only really heard the good hits.  Forget that.<br />How the West Was Won is in my opinion how Led Zeppelin won the world over and became the greatest band of all time.  Robert Plant was always a reason I was never a huge Led Zep fan, I never was a huge fan of his vocals.  In recent years I have come to enjoy and appreciate them much more.  Still i wasnt completely won over.  Robert's vocals in this CD are scrumtrilescent.  He add's more enthusiasm and just makes the songs much better.  Black Dog was always my favorite Zeppelin song and his vocals make it so much better.  He also adds a wierd lyric a little into the song, which is a little wierd but still great.  <br />Jimmy Page stays the same, which you may think may not be good.  No its great.  Jimmy Page is one of the greatest guitar players ever and needs no change.<br />How the West Was Won is both scrumtrilescent (meaning too great that no words can describe, so we will make one up, yes it is fake don't bother looking it up, and yes i did steal it from a Will Ferrell skit) and worthy of 6 stars.
B00004YA12|3.0|I object to the placing of the reviews under different/wrong DVD releases!  Now you are looking at the Moonstone release. It does not contain a booklet. It is a PAL version. It is poor quality picture, only slightly better than VHS.  It also contains the short film Tag der Freiheit.  The sound, however, is quite good!<BR>It is hard to choose, sometimes, but not with Triumph des Willens; nothing beats the Synapse special edition with commentary track! The picture and sound is probably better than you'll ever see.
0684135051|5.0|Thirty years ago, in college, I knitted up a storm. Then Life got in the way, and I quit - partly because knitting had become an addiction and nothing else was getting done. Now I'm back at it again - hoping to keep the compulsion under check, this time - but of course, one forgets quite a bit in 30 yrs.<BR>It was with delight and relief that I discovered EZ's wonderful book. As I read the first few pages, things began coming back to me: the terminology, the challenges, the frustrations, the successes...and finally the technique.<BR>If you buy this book for no other reason than the patter for the 'seamless sweater,' your money will have been well-spent. But into the bargain, you also get the feeling that a skilled, patient and loquacious friendly fellow knittress is sitting at your side, ready, if necessary, to take the needles from your cramped fingers and show you exactly what she's talking about.<BR>Buy it.
B000002UAI|4.0|Despite the covers and the hurried and melancholy tone, \\"Beatles for Sale\\" shows Paul and John hitting their goal of becoming the \\"Carole King and Gerry Goffin of England.\\"  Intelligent if somewhat offhand lyrics (\\"No Reply\\", \\"I'm a Loser\\"), captivating melodies and harmonies (\\"I'll Follow the Sun\\", \\"Every Little Thing\\"), outside-the-box instrumentation (George's electric guitar-lin in \\"Words of Love\\"), and some of the best hooks of 1964 (\\"Eight Days a Week\\", \\"What You're Doing\\"), make this album a gem.<br />Before John and Paul started writing their own, one of their gifts was picking offbeat covers, and the goofy but tender \\"Mr. Moonlight\\" is one of these.  John's opening wail is heart-rending.<br />In 1964 I had these hooks running through my head during most of my waking hours.  Now, as a bit of a student of pop music, I can easily see why these songs were respected by serious musicians, avoided by garage bands and folksingers, and loved by most all of us.
B000089RVX|5.0|Great guitar riffs, moving melodic(spelling??)singing, and a CD without a single song to NOT listne to. When I first saw the Bring Me to Life video, I was hooked. I picked up the CD the next day and fell in love with the CD.<br />1. Going Under - 5 Stars, reminds me a bit of Linkin Park but has its own original sound.<BR>2. Bring Me to Life - 5 Stars, first song I heard and with the guest vocals makes it a classic.<BR>3. Everybody's Fool - 5 Stars, one of my favorites. Awesome guitar and lyrics!<BR>4. My Immortal - 4 Stars, Not my kind of song but still one of my favorites!<BR>5. Haunted - 5 Stars, Weird but sweet! 2nd best on album!<BR>6. Tourniquet - 5 Stars, Excellent song, great chorus!<BR>7. Imaginary - 5 Stars, the beginning guitar riff is sweet and the lyrics are the best!<BR>8. Taking Over Me - 4 Stars, my least favorite song but still good.<BR>9. Hello - 5 Stars, I like the piano and lyrics in this song<BR>10. My Last Breath - 5 Stars, the BEST song on the CD. About suicide and kind of depressing but is great!<BR>11. Whisper - 5 Stars, I love the way Amy sings in this song. Excellent!!<br />If you have not picked this hit up yet, you need to right NOW!!!
B00005JKN9|2.0|Well, I'm a big fan of Scorsese's work.  And while this film has a brilliant performance by Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill the Butcher, the film as a whole is a tough one to enjoy.  It's far too long and aspires to be a sort of historical document to this period in New York.  The core story - the relationship between Bill the Butcher and Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) - is very promising, but Scorsese seems willing to take up every available tangent and in the process delivers a tiring, disjointed film.  Even as the film reaches it's climax we find we've got another twenty minutes to go.  Scorsese is one of the finest filmmakers of our time, but he may have been too close to this story.<br />This is arguably the best work from actor Daniel Day-Lewis and the film may be worth watching on that basis alone.  But I'd have a hard time sitting through it again.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence...  the newest rock group ot there, and certainly one of the most unforgettable.<BR>While other groups like ACDC and Bon Jovi have become rock-hard legends in the world of rock by pounding out traditional rock songs, Evanescence chose to get there by taking a different path. And believe me, (and the credits, plus all the fans out there-) they have succeeded in taking that path, and by all means, getting there. Their style is a bit different than most traditional rock artists. While there are punk/rock bands making fools of themselves just for a bit of attention in front of the camera, Evanescence works hard for the money-- and the fame. But if you ask lead singer Amy Lee, she'll tell you it's about singing her heart out, and about her emotions. You'll notice that all 11 of the songs on their CD, &quot;Fallen&quot;, revolve around mournful thoughts, and have a depressing sort of tone. These hauntingly beautiful lyrics along with Amy's one-of-a-kind hypnotic voice blend with that traditonal rock music, to create the masterpiece album, which has already gone Platinum in the short 2 months in which  it has been out. But of course, we already knew that they would be a hit, ever since that that first hit single, everyone's favorite song, &quot;Bring me to Life&quot; came out. I'll never forget the first time I heard that song on the radio, there driving in the car. My breath was taken away, and the song just blew me away. It was amazing, and completely beautiful. Her voice was like another Enya, and combined with the rock tones, it was incredible. Who thought that a female artist would make it so big on the rock billboards?<BR>Well, Amy has certainly proven herself worthy, along with her band from Little Rock, Arkansas. Not only has their album gone platinum, but it is also currently #1(!) on the European Top 100 Albums chart. It is very apparant that this all- American band is making it big all around the world, and everywhere they go. ~
B000000WFF|5.0|I'm sorry, but I just really luv this album by the Spice Girls - if that makes me a bad person, then so be it!!<br />My only question is, how could you not luv the Girls of Spice??<BR>In fact, this record is even fresher than their debut, and that's saying quit a lot!!!  I don't know, I just feel that the sounds on this pop album are a bit bolder, more savvy, and even more diverse at times.  While the first Spice Girls CD focused on fun bubblegum sounds, this one shows the ladies maturing a lot more, trying new rhythms, basically just being themselves.<br />WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT, PEOPLE!!??<br />Like Madonna and other entrepreneurs before them, these lovely British ladies had a fine Top 40 career - here's hoping they come back soon to us, right!!!<br />How could you not luv this album??!!
B000059TPI|5.0|That's right, you can't have too many friends.  Or at least, that's what Elwood P. Dowd quips to his sister, Veta Louise, as he invites a total stranger (a taxi driver this time, earlier he invited Mr. Meegles the excon, Dr. Sanderson the psychiatrist, Miss Kelly the nurse, Mrs. Chumley the wife of the head of the insane asylum, and Mr. Shimmelplusser who works the security gate at the asylum) over to their house for dinner.  Many fans and film critics refer to Dowd as an alcoholic, and any psychologist worth his salt probably would also when they witness Dowd's nonchalant conversations with his best friend Harvey -- the 6-foot (&quot;6-foot-3-and-a-half, now let's stick to the facts.&quot;) invisible rabbit.  Interestingly though, I read the other day that throughout the course of the movie, you never see Elwood Dowd consume any alcohol at all.<br />We really don't know what Elwood would be like if the rabbit were not in the picture, although a character in the film gives us a few hints of what it would be like (but I won't spoil that part for you).  Probably, it is the rabbit that makes Elwood the poster child for HOW TO WIN FRIENDS AND INFLUENCE PEOPLE.  Elwood is the kind of person you would love to be friends with.  He's the kind of person who would rather hear you talk about yourself than bore (or perhaps intrigue) you with all the details of his own life.  When it comes time to thank or compliment a person, Elwood does it in full force.  Elwood is not easily angered or offended.  In fact, the plot of the movie revolves around Elwood's sister Veta Louise trying to have him committed.  When Elwood officially discovers this (personally, I think he knew it all the time), instead of being indignant and angry, he compliments her strength and energy.  After that, he is asked whether or not he has any righteous indignation, to which he replies that his mother always used to tell him that<br />&quot;in this world...you must be oh so smart or oh so pleasant.  Well, foryears I was smart; I recommend pleasant.  And you may quote me.&quot;<br />The acting in this film is entirely top notch throughout, right down to Mr. Cracker the bartender (who only had one or two lines).  Josephine Hull even won a Best Actress Oscar for her brilliant portrayal of Veta Louise Simmons.  And remember, this was back in the days when winning an Oscar actually meant something!  I was recently asked who I think is the best female performance I've ever seen in a movie.  I had totally forgotten about Josephine Hull, but now, I'd like to go on record saying the hers was by far the very best I have ever seen.<br />You can think of this as a comedy, and that is certainly how it is catgorized.  But this is also a sweet and tender story about the joys and values of friendship(s).<br />Although this is one of my all-time favorite movies, I have had to put off reviewing it because I'm afraid my review may not do this great movie any justice.  So, if you read the review and then have low expectations of this film, then, please, blame me and watch the movie anyway!
B00005L996|5.0|Guys, if your a TRUE Slipknot fan u have got to buy this album.  Most bands sell out over time but this band has just gotten better.  Joey's, Shawn's, and Chris's ... drummin, Mick's and Jim's guitaring, and Corey's singing are all 50 times better than in Slipknot's self-titled, first album.  The live song, Liberate, is not the same as actually being at a Knot concert but it will influence you to check them out.  Stay (sic), metalheads.
B00006F7S4|4.0|I hesitate to say I've never heard anything like it - because the songs comes across as music that is fairly plain - but I've certainly never experienced an album grow on me so slowly.<br />I had heard the rave reviews, and found them more enjoyable than the album (on my first listen). I felt inadequate - I couldn't seem to \\"feel the magic\\". Even \\"slow\\" albums grow on me within a few listens, but I reckon sea change took nearly ten listens for full effect.<br />It is sombre; there's no denying that. Sea change is uncompromisingly sad and lonely - there is no schmaltzy happy ending here - and naturally so, by which it conjures a palpable brooding in every listen. But sea change is real; it doesn't glorify depression like some albums (or bands) do. As such, it doesn't depress me - but it is moving.<br />If your wondering what happened to the garish Beck of Sexx Laws or Tropicalia, so am I. But that's part of the appeal as long as you've a somewhat eclectic taste.<br />Within such an atmosphere, \\"plain\\" songs become minimalist magic. Lost Cause is nothing more than [verse, chorus, repeat x3] but it is done so crisply, and in such contrast to its neighbours, that it becomes one of the album's highlights. And by \\"plain\\", I don't mean derivative or mediocre, I mean unadorned.<br />And don't let \\"minimalist\\" be interpreted as \\"uninventive\\". Round the Bend is minimalist in that it is just a Mr. Hanson accompanied by a string quartet - but he displays one of the most astoundingly clever vocal performances I've heard. Beck's vocals mimic the timbre and dynamics of the strings in an indescribable way that really requires a listen. The result is incredible.<br />The sombre intensity of Lonesome Tears works really well too, especially with its lo-fi production - particularly the \\"crackly\\", monotony of the snare.<br />A few tracks are still beyond me; I'm not sure whether to mutter \\"filler\\" or wait until I do appreciate them. This is the nature of this masterpiece - the music issometimes unfathomable. But swim deeper and you should be rewarded.
B000002LQR|5.0|great CD, my favorite of RHCP, my personal favorites are Mellowship Slinky in B Major, and Under the Bridge. Its a CD for anybody, because RHCP mixes so many different music genres. And for all the reviewers that say the last song [is bad], i dont think they put the song in for MUSICAL enjoyment :).
B000002H2H|5.0|This is one the best Metallica albums someone can have.<br />The heavy and fast \\"Fight fire with Fire\\" start things in a total speed Metal way. <br />\\"For Whome the Belltolls\\" is a little slower and easier to play, yet again, very heavy ...!<br />\\"Fade To Black\\" is the ballad everyone knows. Very great done and arranged.<br />The rest of the album is just simply awesome Metal, eventhough, the masterpiece of the album is at the end \\"The Call of Ktulu\\" is definitely Metallica at it's best.<br />Just gotta have it. Metallica doesn't make records like this anymore and this was the base of Metallica's next albums MOP and AJFA.<br />Highlights: \\"The Call OF Ktulu\\", \\"Fight Fire with Fire\\"
0553260111|5.0|A nameless man who will later be revealed to be Jason Bourne awakens in the home of an inebriated doctor in Port Noir, an island south of Marseille.  He had been peppered with gunshot wounds and near dearh when he was fished out of the sea by a passing trawler.  The doctor has nursed the nameless one back to health but unfortunately was unable to cure a case of total amnesia.  During his examination the doctor removed a piece of microfilm surgically implanted under the skin of his patient.  On it was revealed an account number in a Zurich bank.<br />With help from the doctor and a phony passport the nameless man travels to Zurich to investigate the bank account.  After gaining access to the safe deposit box the nameless man discovers that he is Jason Bourne of the Treadstone company and in possesion of millions of dollars.

B000000OSG|5.0|If you have heard UYI 1. You have a clue of what you will hear on part 2. <br />There is a lot more slow songs rather than the fast, heavy ones. \\"Knocking on Heaven's Door\\", is one of the best ones here. The epic \\"Estranged\\" is November Rain's part two. There is a \\"Don't Cry (Alt. Lyrics)\\" which is good if you don't have UYI 1. <br />Otherwise ther are the hard rockers like \\"You Could Be Mine\\" that sounds like a song from Appetite. The fast and heavy \\"Shotgun Blues\\", Izzy's kick ... \\"Pretty Tied Up\\", Slash's \\"Locomotive\\", and the awesome hard rock song \\"Civil War\\" definitely one of the best songs ever recorded in music history (which also has Gn'R's original drummer Steve Adler).<br />Enough said, if you have UYI 1, you must have UYI 2. Otherwise the hits on UYI 2, justify just having it even if you are not a Gn'R fan.<br />Highlights: \\"KNocking on Heaven's Door\\", \\"Stranged\\", \\"YOu could be mine\\"

B000002UUX|5.0|Rust in Peace is megadeth's best and last Thrash metal effort, with a line up that straight up kicks .... <br />THe opener \\"Holy Wars...\\" features the best riff ever written in Metal history, a set of fast scales that would predict what would come later in the album.<br />\\"Hangar 18\\" is another Megadeth classic. It's got some amazing riffs, speeds and a kick ... solo that only Mustaine and his boys can deliver.<br />Another highlights are \\"Lucretia\\" and the great \\"Tornado of Souls\\", both offering kick ... thrash (fast and heavy) with at the same time feature great melodies.<br />The bass driven \\"Dawn Patrol\\" is David Ellefson's great work. It's a change in the album, but still is interesting and fun to listen to. <br />The production of the album is very much better than the previous efforts (and even some later ones), Mike Clink (producer from Gn'R) does a great job delivering raw, and heavy rock the way it should always be.<br />This album is a Metal Classic, and a must have for a Thrash collector as myself. <br />Highlights: \\"Holy Wars... The punishment is due\\", \\"Hangar 18\\"
B00005JLSE|4.0|Personally I'm not a fan of new musicals.  I don't mind old musicals from the 50s like Singing in the Rain, but when a new movie comes out that's a musical, I just think it's kind of weird in modern film-making, even if the movie is based on a Broadway show.  Remember to take that into consideration about my review, because it probably means the movies better than what I say.<br />Based on the Broadway show, \\"Chicago\\" was about Roxy Hart, who got arrested for shooting and killing the man she was cheating on her husband with.  She then goes to prison, and with some help from Mama (Queen Latifa) and her lawyer (Richard Gere), she is able to win the public's support, lie her way through her court trial, and become a famous Vaudeville actress.  <br />The musical parts of this movie were the highlight, even though the music wasn't your typical Danny Elfman (based his music on the original from the broadway show).  The musical sections would come in as Roxy would imagine an alternate reality where she was a famous singer, and the whole story was a show.  The highlights of the best musical scenes were where everyone was Richard Gere's puppet, and he did the talking for Roxy and a croud of reporters.  This was probably one of the most fun scenes in the movie, but the Circus/Courtroom scene was also very well done.  It switched flawlessly from reality to Roxy's imagination.  <br />Like I said, I don't like most musicals, so my rating may be lower than it would be if I loved musicals, but overall, I'll give this movie 4 out of 5 stars.  Pretty good if you ask me from someone who doesn't like musicals.
B00002Z88D|1.0|After the mediocre Black Album, the not so good Load, and the horrible Reload, you can assume what would come in this album.<br />As a Metallica fan ... Sounds like a cover 90's mediocre alternative band covering Metallica.<br />The 90's songs don't sound too bad with the orchestra added, in fact they sound better. But the 80's speed and thrash metal songs were KILLED.<br />The one and only highlight was \\"No Leaf Clover\\", a very well done and interesting song.<br />\\"The Call of Ktulu\\" sounds great too since we don't have to listen to James voice, which is not the greatest since AJFA.<br />The kill of the album is \\"Of Wolf and Man\\" they destroyed that song.<br />Save your money!!!
B00009APK1|3.0|I didn't really like the first movie in the Lord of the Rings Triligy until the second time I saw it, so The Two Towers may be the same way.  Not that I'm saying it was all bad.  It just seemed WAY too long.  They could have cut a lot of those fight scenes in half and still have gotten the point across.  <br />The Two Towers picks up where The Fellowship of the Ring abruptly ends.  There isn't really anything telling about the first movie except for the scene with Gandoph's famous line \\"YOU SHALL NOT PASS\\" and when the demon pulls him into the pit, you follow him and see him stabing the demon with his sword on the fall, until they hit land, and that's when Frodo wakes up and realizes that Gandoph's fall was a dream.  Golum (the creature that wants \\"our precious\\") has a bigger role in this part of the story than in the first one.  He actually is one of the main characters.  Golum (with his split personalitys) act's as Frodo's and Sam's guide to the black gate of Mordor.   Also, the other remaining part of the Fellowship of the ring after it split up went off to find the two hobbits that were captured by the Orcs in the first movie.  They escape from the Orcs, and venture into a dark forest complete with walking and talking trees, but I'll get back to them.  Meanwhile, the Orcs from Isengard (the evil wizards tower) are sent to attack a castle that held one of the few groups of men that didn't go to the evil side.  These people are then joined by the Elfs, and are losing the war against the Orcs until Gandoph comes back (Frodo's dream was true) as instead of Gandoph the Grey, as Gandoph the White.  He is accompanied by an army that beat's the orcs.  Meanwhile, the trees see what Isengard's orcs did to the forest and declare war.  They attack the tower, and destroy it by breaking a dam and flooding it, stopping all of the orc's industry in the process.  Then, when the story should be over, Golums evil side takes over, and decides to kill Sam and Frodo in order to get \\"Our Precious,\\" and then decides that a mysterious \\"she\\" should kill them.  And then, after a 3 hour movie (6 hours of story so far), the movie stops and leaves off for part 3.  Return of the King.<br />Long story, huh?  Something good about this movie was the excellent special effects.  I imagine that it was done by ILM, and if it was, it was their work at their best.  Some of that stuff that they did in this movie was so impressive that it was hard to imagine it being fake.<br />Lord of the Rings has so many underlieing themes that you notice as you watch it.  Of course, there's the good/evil theme which may be why it's so much like Star Wars, or maybe because Star Wars has the same type of fighting scenes.  There's also the theme of industry taking over agriculture.  The evil is industry, and the good is agriculture.  All of the evil forces in the story cut down forests, make objects, etc, while good forces are all farmers that live off of the land, or mine, or do something that doesn't involve destorying something for good.  Like in the real world, industry will win (hate to ruin the ending).<br />I'll give this movie 3 stars, but as a whole, the triligy may be worth possibly even 5 stars.
B000002JS6|5.0|the album Back in Black by AC/DC is one of the best ones you'll ever hear.  With the recent program Ultimate Album on the Vh1 channel Back in Black has gained a new audience.  For a good reason too.  If you want a nice slow but still rocking song to hear you go for Hells Bells,  if you want a classic rock song you go for Back in Black, and the best song on this album ou go for Shook me all night long. And for great songs refer to any other song on the album.
B00005KB9R|5.0|You can't put anything of Marley in words, it just has that &quot;feel good vibe&quot; to it. I think this is possibly Marley's greatest work. The Wailers (when Livingston and Tosh were still in the group) we a group of musicians like no other. People say that Legend is his best, but that's because people took Marley's best pre-recorded material. What makes this album so amazing is the fact that These are the original tracks on the album, nobody compiled them, Burnin' just turned out amazing. Bob Marley influenced the world and this shows you how gifted he really was. The only other Marley album(s) to compare with this is the &quot;Songs of Freedom&quot; boxset. If you have the 60 dollars, it is well worth it.
B0000524CY|5.0|Words can not even begin to describe the horror of this movie!!! I am a big horror movie buff for all kinds of horror movies. Hardly any horror movies really scare me anymore but are still good to watch, but everytime I seee this movie I get goosebumps all over me and sometimes I'm even afraid to go out into my hallway at night after I see the \\"spiderwalk\\". This movie was a true masterpiece, something that even Wes Craven or John Carpenter couldn't pull off. It is about an evil demon spirit names Pazuzu taking over a 12 year old girl's body and making her horribly disfigured. I have to warn everyone DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM WHEN IT IS PITCH DARK OUT WITH ALL OF THE LIGHTS OUT!!! It can even be frightening to watch in total sunlight, this movie is for true horror movie buffs but not for the faint of heart!!! don't bother getting the exorcist 2 or 3 because they are not good at all and are most definetly not as scary as the original was. I strongly feel that there will never be another horror movie made ever again that can surpass \\"The Exorcist\\" because \\"The Exorcist\\" is the one horror movie in which all other horror movies are judged upon.
B00000258J|5.0|Often you listen to a seminal artist and wonder, \\"what if they had captured this person at the top of their game, doing some of their better material with better musicians, in a more modern recording studio?\\" Well, here is THAT recording! First of all, Johnny Winter can't be given enough credit for setting this up, then executing it to perfection. There is only one way to describe this recording and that would be SHEER JOY! It is like some kind of religious experience. I remember hearing Mannish Boy when I was in early High School, while I was just learning how to really play the guitar, and I immediately knew, \\"Hey, this is where it begins!\\" Even Muddy said that this was his best album. There's nothing phony or forced on this work, oh no, it's like some kind of revival meeting where THE MINISTER of the blues \\"lays down THE TRUE WORD\\"...Glory Be! Throughout the entire set Johnny's yelping and howling, Muddy's laughing and joshing, however, this isn't a sloppy session; it's because they all know they're \\"in the zone,\\" and they're unleashing THE BLUES as well anybody possibly ever could. If a person doesn't LOVE this record as soon as they put it on, then that person must be seriously \\"out of tune,\\" in some manner?  There's no \\"hidden meaning\\" here; the music is BLACK and WHITE! In fact, even if you're an established musician, you should play this occaisionally, to make sure that ya haven't strayed too far from \\"the basics.\\" If you're only just listening, then relax and enjoy the ride, because Muddy's \\"driving the Bus!\\" 5 stars; well, how do you rate a sunny day? One of music's most \\"inspirational\\" and \\"wonderful\\" recordings...Muddy, you're \\"THE MAN!\\" This is as \\"REAL\\" as it gets, and if I could only have ONE blues recording in my collection, then this is THE ONE. Yeah, it's that GOOD, in every sense of the word!  As if that isn't \\"GOOD ENOUGH,\\" well, I'm Ready and King Bee are just about as GOOD...AND YOU CAN'T GET ENOUGH of ANYTHING this GOOD!!!
B00005OAIE|5.0|I love this CD! Living in a big city and using public transportation, I love a CD that I can crank up and drown out the sound of the bus or train. John has a great blues sound that calms me down. John is my age, and his words remind me of times gone by (83) and also reminds me that others feel the same way I do- (why Georgia) He is a great singer/songwriter and you should RUN out to buy Room For Squares!
B00007FCTH|4.0|In the movie Citizen Kane, auteur Orson Welles uses a variety of visual effects to make his film appealing to audiences. The film begins in medias res because Kane has already died at the start of the film. This technique is used to immediately capture the attention of the audience. The film is about a group of reporters who set out to research the life of the very rich, static character Charles Kane. Their goal was to discover the meaning behind his last words, \\"Rosebud.\\" The audience learns about the life of Kane through the use of flashbacks and a nonlinear film structure. As the reporters interview different people in Kane's life, we are taken back in time to witness the relationship Kane had with those people. This style of film is much more interesting than the normal chronological structure. <BR>The flashback to Kane's childhood shows a happy boy playing in the snow on his sled. His mother is inside making arrangements to send him away after learning Charles would be inheriting a large sum of money. The extreme close up angle of her face shows that she believes she is doing this for the good of her son. She obviously feels he would be better off away from his father, especially with all of the money he will receive. This flashback explains why later in life Kane's character is so concerned with earning the love and acceptance of others. He felt like his mother sent him away because he wasn't good enough. He spends his adult life trying to force people to love him. He marries two different women, runs for governor, and buys a few newspapers in an attempt to control what people think. Unfortunately, nothing works out as Kane would have liked, and he dies a very lonely man. In order for a film to be successful, the audience must have a connection with the main character. The flashback to Kane's childhood makes the audience feel sorry for him and understand why he is the man he is.<BR>The direction style in this film was way ahead of its time. Fading scenes madesmooth transitions, even with the nonlinear structure in which it is filmed. Filming in black and white allowed Welles to take advantage of shadows. When Susan tries to convince Kane that she does not want to sing anymore, he steps towards her and his shadow covers her face as he tells her she cannot quit. She is singing again in the next scene. The camera angles are high as Kane gives his speech during the run for governor to indict that power and presence Kane exhibits. When Susan leaves Kane, there is a close up of a bird squawking loudly, which shows the emotional turmoil Kane is suffering through as he becomes alone once again.<BR>There is a lot of symbolism in Citizen Kane. The most important symbol is the sled called Rosebud, which represents the only time Kane was ever truly happy in his life. This symbolism technique is called value placed on an object by a character. The reporters in the film fail to uncover the meaning of Rosebud, and in the denouement it is ironically burned as junk. The snow globe also represents his happy early childhood. The palace he builds represents Kane's wealth and power, yet all the space inside represents how lonely he really is inside.<BR>Kane's character remains static throughout the movie. Even when he realizes he is losing those close to him, he refuses to change his ways. He loses two wives and his best friend and is left to die alone and miserable. Susan's character is very innocent and nave when she first meets Kane. After many years in an unhappy marriage, she develops the nerve to leave Kane.<BR>The unique style of directing and great acting makes Citizen Kane a fantastic movie.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is a truly wonderful book.  It was definitely a worthwhile and entertaining read that can be very thought provoking.  Ender is a captivating character, who exemplifies the human sprit of determination and courage.  He is so easy to relate to, that after a while he seems like a real person, someone you care about like a friend.  Even though it is a sci-fi novel, typically non-science-fiction readers would not be turned off by it, because the science fiction element is only second the to the theme of humanity and the relationships between human beings and their emotions, which anyone can relate to.  The story flows smoothly and keeps the reader entertained through the action packed descriptions of the \\"games\\" Ender plays at Battle School.  <BR>The book is not particularly difficult, but it is on the long side.  Yet, it does not seem nearly as long as its actual 324 pages, and can be a quick read.  The world Card creates is mesmerising, and you can not help but wonder what will be come of Ender in school, where he has made many enemies, and back on Earth, where his brother and sister are attempting to make influences on politics with fake identities.  The ending was a major cliffhanger, that leaves you wanting to read the next book.  HIGHLY RECCOMENDED TO ADULTS AND CHILDREN ALIKE.
B00005N915|4.0|This movie mixes the genres of a mystery, horror, and the paranormal into one very odd but very satisfying movie.  It contains explicit violence and sex, so kiddies should not really see this movie.  The movie also caused a scandal for (at the time) Cosby girl Lisa Bonet.<br />Mystery man Robert Deniro hires gumshoe Mickey Rourke to find a man who owes him a really big debt.  Big surprise twist in the end!  Heartbreaking scene when Rourke actually finds the man.  Mickey Rourke has been in many [bad] movies, but this is one of his best.  He gives a great performance.  Deniro is pretty scary in the end also.<br />Give this movie a chance.
B00008PX8P|5.0|A great set to own if you like Led Zeppelin.  Great footage.  A lot of stuff that hasn't ever been seen before.  It's great to see Led Zeppelin live, since I didn't have the oppurtunity back in the day (since I'm only eighteen).
B000062TU1|5.0|I actually read the book before I saw the movie, something that's usually the other way around for me! And I can say it really follows the book pretty well.<br />I love the books, they're pure magic. They stir up excitement in my inner child- something that really takes something special to do.<br />And the film is wonderful-- It's exellently cast, just as I imagined the characters, and better! The cinematography is lush, the special effects are exciting, the script is fantastic and funny. And the sets are amazing.<br />The young actors are really good- very believable and so cute. I really enjoyed their preformances, especially Daniel Radcliffe. <BR>Emma Watson was great as the perfectionist (slightly know-it-all) Hermione, Tom Felton is really funny as Draco Malfoy, the snob(with greased back hair) who's attracted to the dark arts. And Rupert Grint as Ron is the best support, he's wonderful. :-) But all the children are great. <br />I also enjoyed Alan Rickman (as the mysterious Snape) Maggie Smith (who always delivers a wonderful preformance!) Robbie Coltrane (who is marvelous & hilarious as Hagrid) and Ian Hart. I'm also glad the cast were British. Since the story takes place there, to hear the real accents, rather than bad fakes, was (maybe trivial) but a nice touch anyway.<br />And I adore the story.<br />The people who protest these books, are out of their skulls! Harry Potter is about how good triumphs over evil and how love is the most powerful magic.<br />The story (and the movie) moves all emotions---<BR>It'll make you laugh and it'll make you cry, both from sadness and happiness.<br />I can't believe this movie only made a four star rating. Who'd actually vote for less? it's a fantastically made film. And this first one is and will always be my favorite. A film I can watch again and again.<br />The soundtrack is also very beautiful and magical on it's own.<br />Long live Harry Potter!
B00008PW3Q|1.0|I was excited to get my new copy of this cd, but was very disappointed with the lack of content I found after playing it.  I've always been a big fan of Fleetwood Mac, and I guess it is tough to top 'Roumors', but I at least expected 'Say You Will' to be as good as 'Tusk' (which seemed to put them on a downward spiral).  I don't think there's a single hit song out of all 18 cuts on this cd.  Definetly none you'll find yourself singing in the shower.  <br />Stevie's got a great voice, but it seemed too many of the songs were written at the lower end of her range.  Much of it sounded more like Bernadette Peters in 'Blazzing Saddles'!  And if you listen closely several songs have a hint of bluegrass in them.  Not that that is all bad, just totally unexpected.<br />Don't be tricked like I was by the VH1 show 'Total Access'.  Save your money and buy the old stuff if you don't have it now.  There won't be any roumors about this cd.......no one will be talking about it at all.

0802130208|1.0|I've gotten into arguments about whether this book is any good. OK, reasonable minds may differ, but I'm baffled by the 400-500 positive reviews of this novel.  I don't know how it rates as Literature (O'Toole obviously put a lot of effort into it anyway), but the story is uninteresting and the humor is utterly sophomoric. Imagine someone inserting chopsticks up his nostrils for laughs--that's what this book is like, somehow.  When I tried reading it in high school (when I would read just about anything), I lost interest quickly; it was only a couple years ago that--after hearing someone rave about it again--I managed to slog through to the end.  Boring boring boring.  I'm not going to change anyone's mind by writing a long critique of it--which would be nothing against the avalanche of praise hereabouts.  All I'm going to do is try to list some books and other stuff I DO find funny, or not funny:  <br />--> Some books and stuff I DO find funny:  Catch-22; The 776 Stupidest Things Ever Said; Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (esp. Restaurant at the End of the Universe); This is Spinal Tap; Wayne's World; Groundhog Day; The Darwin Awards; The Far Side; Seinfeld; Liar's Poker; The Onion (1/3 of the time); Letterman in the 80s-mid 90s; Saturday Nite Live when it was still any good; early Eddie Murphy standup routines; Mike Luckovich<br />--> Some books and stuff I DON'T find funny:  Austin Power II (didn't catch the first one); The Onion (2/3 of the time); SNL in the past 5-6 years (the lame jokes are not that different from O'Toole's); Steve Martin; recent Eddie Murphy movies; Art Buchwald.<br />So that's me, and I DON'T find Confederacy funny at all.  I know there are probably a lot of people who'd agree with me about all of the above picks--and yet still find Confederacy funny.  There's no accounting for it.  But I'll suggest that, if you just try reading the first 3 pages of the book, and you're not amused by it already, you never will be.
0060507772|5.0|What a fabulous, fabulous book! Not only is it another wonderful yarn by Mr. Pratchett, but it is filled with absolutely WONDERFUL art that is at times stunning, and at other times very humorous.<br />For fans of Mr. Pratchett's other novels, there are numerous walk-ins by his other famous characters, which only adds to the fun. The story is original, though obviously satyrizing numerous greek myths.<br />I cannot recommend this book enough, it is an absolute delight.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I don't know what happen to previous reviewer, but what he/she said about didn't happen to me. This DVD is marvelous, beyond my expectation. Thank you Jimmy!!<br />The only LedZep concert I ever watch was \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" video which I didn't enjoy very much. But this DVD is different. You expect concerts, you'll have it. Some friend said I can not have LedZep playing in concert as good as their records, but since I saw this DVD, I can prove they were wrong.<br />LedZep can play good and clean in 1970's Royal ALbert Hall. They're exciting. I never see them playing trio so good (if you compare it with \\"the song remains the same\\") with Robert Plant on vocal. Robert also perform excellent and look like real man (compare it with 'the song remains ..' when he's playing finger). They're young, strong, good looking, and have charisma. Bonzo's also in his ultimate performance.<br />On second DVD we can see they performed Immigrant Song (the first Led Zep song I heard when I was just 7). I always wonder how they perform this in concert, but this DVD give the answer. We can see this as video montage, when they're not really filming it when they're playing. This is maybe the previous reviewer talking about. Some scene just grainny, but the sound is good.<br />Still on the second disc, we can see the songs not included in \\"the song remains...\\". What make me happy, I can see them playing Black Dog. Man, they've done it well. I wonder this not in \\"the song remains..\\". We can also see their (last?) performance in 1979 Knebworth concert, when they played some last classic like \\"in the evening\\", \\"kashmir\\", etc. Surprised when I saw Bonzo's still energetic when he close \\"Rock'n Roll\\" with his great drumming roffel.<br />This DVD also provide clips (Oh, I like it), promo, TV concert (Denmark & France TV where audience so neat and calm incl. kids?), and interview (Man, why they'd being quetioned about The Beatles?). The one I complain is... to much \\"Communication Breakdown\\"(almost in all concert and promo). But it's great.<br />As long as we're talking about DVD, the most important is, the pic is clean and bright (not like what previous reviewer said) and I'm happy with it. Great Jimmy, great!!. I'm interested in 'How West Was Won'. Btw, today local newspaper in my place, have an article about this DVD and LedZep. I'm happy to be one who have seen this.<br />To Amazon : I've ever seen DVD call \\"LedZep: Their early concert\\" (or tittled close like it) in local store (but they're gone very fast) which I've never seen sold in your store. Do you have any information about this?
B000000WA4|5.0|if you're looking at this album, and are conidering buying this, you obviously have some great taste in music, so I congradulate you on this. There are some albums that simply cannot be described in words, but I'll try the best that I can.<br />The Smashing Pumpkins had released two albums previous to this. Gish was released in 1991 as their debut album, and the platinum multi-million dollar selling Siamese Dream was released in 1993. Both albums contained pure angst and good, warm-blooded hard rock alternative music. When the Pumpkins released Mellon Collie and The Infinite Sadness, they took a step in another direction, as bands sometimes do. This album was an approach at a mellower Pumpkins, but definately not softer. Songs like Jellybelly, Zero, Bullet With Butterfly Wings, and An Ode To No One take you on a ride through the harder, more driven side of the album, where mellower songs like Galapogos, Thirty-Three, In The Arms Of Sleep, Stumbeline, and Lily grab your heart and rip it to pieces. Some reviews below me state that this album is nothing, it's complete and utter nonsense. One guy even points himself out as not being a worthy reviewer, he claims he hasn't even bought a single pumpkins album, except for the Best Of Promo, which isn't even an official release.<br />This album deserves 5 stars. Rolling Stone gave it 5 stars. It recieved RIAA awards, Grammy's, it went Double Platinum, produced 5 singles, a Box Set, and numerous compilations. The Infinite Sadness Tour was also one of the greatest tours ever performed. You can ask anybody that collects Pumpkins shows, this album defined an era. This is the album that produced the largest fan base. People who complain about this album simply do not know what they are talking about, nor have they given this album time to sink in. I think I'm worthy of an opinion; I have a full bookshelf of pumpkins promos and singles, a full dresser drawer of pumpkins shows (and CDs are only .33 mm thick...think about it), and 4 walls of pumpkins posters. Take it from me -- this album is DEFINATELY worth getting. Go ahead, click the &quot;add to shopping cart&quot; button.walls of pumpkins posters.

B00005JKCH|1.0|Overrated adaptation of the Spider-Man comics in which almost every aspect feels forced and stiff throughout, from the direction to the writing, editing, and acting. I almost bought the DVD without first seeing it because I always liked Spider-Man as a kid and had heard so many good reviews about it. I am so glad that a friend lent it to me so I could see it wasn't worth it. Wish I could get the time I wasted watching this overhyped and overrated film back! I sure hope the sequel isn't this flawed.<br />Also, this is the only DVD ever to completely freeze up in my Toshiba DVD player part way through (out of well over 100 discs I've played in it).

It's destiny.<br />They'd found Bob once before on Highway 61.  Then they sought cleverness and obtuseness.  This time it was simplicity and precision.  <br />There was never a better soul, a keener mind nor a more lucid minstrel in all of rock.<br />And the words never fail....<br />&quot;We sat together in the park, as the evening sky grew dark....&quot;
B00005YW4H|5.0|A lot of people here dont like Norah Jones, but that's be cause they all lsiten to pop music (brittney, christina...)  this is JAZZ folks!! get used to it!  I like this because i'm a huge jazz fan.  If you dont know who Miles David and John Coaltrain or Mannhatten Transfer are, then you wouldn't get this anyway.
B000003CMB|5.0|Sixteen. US Bongs.  Headphones.  And nothing but the best in music.  Ya' can't go back in time .... or can ya' if just in your imagination.  The riffs and hooks of this recording still resonate after all these years.  A timeless masterpiece.  Truly one for the rock ages.
B000002JSP|5.0|this is the one to get!  it has a lot of radio hits and some great keyboard and guitar work.  if your new to the band, start here.  i like it, even if they did get the title from a line in prince's &quot;razberry baray&quot; song.  but this is the true magic and geneous that people say when they talk about this band.
0316776963|5.0|If you have never read David Sedaris or heard him read portions of his books on David Letterman then you need to pick up one of his books and treat yourself.  I have not read one of his books and not laughed hysterically.  I also recommend any book by his sister, Amy Sedaris (I constantly wonder what Thanksgiving dinner is like at their house!)
B00005NOOH|5.0|This is a very well made documentary.  Lots of good footage and the sound work, etc. by the filmakers is outstanding.  It has a very noticable English/European theatre slant to it, but I actually found some of the pacific episodes (the one on the Burma theatre in particular) to be the most interesting.  Some of the naval battles in the pacific have outstanding color film as well!  This is a must have for military history/ world war II buffs.
B00008H2LB|1.0|In this dark age of light music and little talent Linkin Park shine through as the epitome of the marketed popstars wiith guitars.  With no original ideas for structure, no emotion apart from teen angst, pitiful lyrics and riffing structure you could take the guitars from this and I am sure it would sound just like nsync.  Im sorry this may be ok for the teenage kid with an attitude problem towards his parents who need to rebel without a cause and give his backstreet boys albums a rest but if you need something with substance, look elsewhere.
0142004235|5.0|When i first read &quot;East of Eden&quot; back in 1986 I remember my teacher telling the class that we had 3 weeks to read the book and have a book report ready to discuss during week 4. Then the teacher handed out the books and the class started making noises, ie...moan, no, oh.  The book was as fat as the phone book and look/sounded &quot;B&quot; boring. <br />I began reading East of Eden the following day. I remember it was Friday night and I had just finished watching tv and wanted to start reading this boring book to see what non-sense I was in for. The first chapter grabbed me and wouldn't let go. The story is very realistic and has great character development. I'm not going to talk about the story because there is too much to talk about, but it plays on a lot of emotions and it will make you use your imagination, much like you/we did when we were children. <br />Thanks John...You will always be remembered for this great classic novel. <BR>P.S. some literary boneheads/stuffy people ( you know who you are) disliked this story, but for those of us who like jam on our toast (not dry) you will like it.....Daniel
1400034779|5.0|The lady detective of Botswana is utterly charming. She pursues her cases with logic and diligence. The local color in the story is delightful. It even seems that the political scene is correctly drawn when allusions are made to the rather step-child relationship Botswana has with South Africa. The cases for which clients seek solutions include an incident of witch craft, a matter of insurance fraud for an amputated finger, an instance of blurred identity in the medical profession where twins function as one physician, and a tale of a straying husband.
B000092ZYY|5.0|I saw a lot of reviews saying: &quot;not enough guitar&quot;, &quot;not like in the beginning&quot;,...<BR>What disappoints me is that when a band doesn't &quot;follow the path&quot;, or makes something different from commercial songs they got blamed.<BR>People must understand that musically, Radiohead evolve but their spirit is still there. Feel every song, don't just listen to it.<br />In my opinion, there isn't an album better than another. They all deserve 5 stars for their creativity and genius.
B000089RVX|5.0|This album is the best album of 2003 and though we're only at the start of July, I don't think any album this year will come any where close to 'Fallen'!<br />Here's how I rate the songs:<br />1. Going Under: The new single, is so cool, the way she sings is just beautiful but haunting - 4/5<br />2. Bring Me To Life: The song that when anybody hears the word 'Evanescence' They think of, Such a Cool record, but I would have liked to hear more of Paul McCoy (12 Stones)on the album, such a video!!! - 5/5<br />3. Everybody's Fool: this was the first song (apart from B.M.T.L)I liked when I heared the album - 4/5<br />4. My Immortal: A great song! The acoustic version of it is brilliant that you'll get on the D.V.D - 5/5<br />5. Haunted : My favourite song on this album (Except from 'Imaginary')Such a great song, the lyrics and the way Amy sings them is just perfect, and the creepy choir adds to the drama - 6/5 (no it's not a typo)<br />6. Tourniquet : My least favourite (Apart from 'Hello') record on this album, it was just a little weird for my liking - 3.5/5<br />7. Imaginary : How great is this song?! It's just spectacular, the way when you know and hear the lyrics the way you get a sureal picture of a feild of flowers and purple skys etc.! - 8/5<br />8. Taking Over Me: This is one of the songs when I look back on the album i forget, it just doesn't make an impact on me like the others do, but when I do remember it it's a good little song - 4/5<br />9. Hello: It's a drag! by this song the album becomes a chore, like you feel you just want the album to end but like you have to, for some reason hear the other two songs - 2.5/5<br />10. My Last Breath: This song is so good, my favourite part of the song is the 2nd verse about winter and the white hollow tree, it's just brilliant writing!!!!!!! - 7/5<br />11. Whisper: A great song and a great chorus, but by this time you feel like you've already heard the song before because it just sounds too much like another song, you get this alot on the album, but that's to be expected on their first album, gets a little bit dreey at the end... - 4.5/5<br />so over all it's the best album of the year, you may think i'm a little hypacritic giving some of the songs 3/5 and giving the album 5/5 but when you finish the album you just pause your life and think, 'this is history in the making' because after the album has stopped it comes together as a whole! that's why i give this album 5/5.   I just hope their next album is as good (or even better!!!)
B00005RFVL|5.0|I absolutely love this CD.  Robbie's renditions of these classic songs are outstanding. I listen to it over and over.
0395925037|3.0|to him what he said was very true, he really believed what he was saying. he was an intelligent and well respected bavarian soldier, who for some reason became infatuated with the \\"threats of Marxism\\" and the annihilation of all foreigners specifically the those of jewsih descent. he didnt make himself leader the people made him leader, so they agreed with him. he shouldnt bear 100 percent of the blame. its a very interesting read, one can follow the trasformation that transpires within hitler through the course of the book. when i was reading it, he was justifying everything he stated, i dont remember reading any statements he didnt back up with personal information.
B00008OWZC|2.0|I loved the DVD - top quality sound, wonderful video - so good it made me feel as if I was actually at the concert.  Plus some liner notes that (while containing some glaring typos) were very enjoyable to read.  Very cool.  Worth every penny. Five stars.<br />But this.  This CD set.  No liner notes at all, an odd omission given the obviously enthusiastic fan base and overall/relative dearth of info on the band.  Sound quality is fine - I know they were working with old tapes, as they were with the DVD.  But it's not exceptional.  Why not put HDCD technology on the CD?  Or some other digital enhancement/20bit/24bit conversion technology that currently exists and really does help (it's not like they wouldn't earn back their investment in such tech - the thing's like triple platinum already).  Puzzling.<br />Perhaps after one experiences the DVDs, with its amazing, rich 5.1 sound and really great visuals, this passable 3-CD live set that actually costs more than the DVDs just can't ever really compete.  I'm a big fan of these guys; don't get me wrong.  It just feels like they threw the CDs out there as a bit of an afterthought, knowing that people would snap it up no matter what (and they would be right in thinking that).  Perhaps we'll see a SACD or DVD-A re-master before too long. . . then I'll have to buy the damned things again. . . . .
0790732254|5.0|If there is ever a film acting students must watch, WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? is it. Personally, I had no problem with the DVD. Burton and Taylor are simply marvelous in their roles as two seriously disturbed people who have been married for...much too long. Taylor won an Academy Award and Burton should have won (no disrespect towards Paul Scofield for A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS). Edward Albee's brilliant characters and writing is simply breath-taking. That is if you can take 2 1/2 hours of absorbing drama about four miserable people (George Segal and Sandy Dennis are also excellent as the guests). It is true that a film like this isn't for everyone. The negative reviewers concern themselves with the mood of the film...why would anyone want to watch 4 people yelling at each for over 2 hours...but that isn't a review, and people expecting a Disney version of Albee's play shouldn't be watching it in the first place. Real life isn't easy to watch. Albee's story about an alcoholic professor and his over-bearing alcoholic wife is not easy to watch. Instead, the viewer must watch the film as life-like art, and an example for all filmmakers to follow. Director Mike Nichols had it filmed in black and white (Haskell Wexler), and most of the original play (screenplay by Ernest Lehman) remained intact. In a day when your average movie-going experience involves empty-headed entertainment (Matrix, X-men, Hulk, American Pie, Dumb and Dumberer, etc. - you know what I mean), WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?, even if you need to be in the mood to watch it, is far easier to take in the long run.
6305508550|5.0|This film goes to great lengths to exaggerate minor problems people face everyday, and make them Funny.  I work in a factory on the shop floor, ands I can relate to many of the \\"problems\\" facing this trio of office workers plus 1.  You start off laughing as an old man using a walker, is walking faster then the traffic, Peter, keeps merging into the Moving Lane to try and get through the traffic quicker only to have to jam on the breaks, and see the traffic in the lane he was just in start moving.  The movie has you holding your sides laughing at the mishaps that abound throughout.  Rated R for Language and a humorus sex seen with Peters boss.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead's 3rd album is probably their most complete work to date. It should be listened to as a whole for ultimate effect. When I first bought this record, it took me quite a few listens to even start to enjoy it. Well, they say that the best things in life take time. OK Computer is simply the best record I have had the pleasure of owning. A masterpiece..
0790742780|5.0|Douglas goes on a rampage.  He's lost his wife, his daughter, and his job.  His no fear attitude drives this movie to the edge, causing you to laugh, and cry.  He has a straight forward approach to his problems, from traffic jams, immigrants that speak poor english, gang-banger thugs, to white supremists, fast food businesses that show the thick juicy sandwich but serve dry pieces of cardboard, and making sure his daughter is financially well-off.  Duvall does an excellent job as a co-star tracking down the flipped out Douglas.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I for one have to say that I really enjoyed this movie, I really thought that humor was very funny and appropiate for all ages. When I walked into the theater I thought wait... John Goodman and Billy Crystal, pah this movie is gonna have jokes that most younger audiances will not understand. But I went in because I am a big fan of toy story and thought their might be some hope for this movie<BR>So when I walked in there was this movie playing,...I was laughing so hard. I still think that this is one of the best movies of all time. And it has been over a year of two now since I have seen it. (Just in case you dont know I watch alot of movies)<BR>This movie is about two monsters trying to put a little human back into the human world. They meet a lot of funny yet scary suprises on the Way!<BR>Monsters INC gets two thumbs way way up. I will give this movie 10 out 5 stars. This movie may scare some of the little ones during parts with the monsters. But other than that I think this is a movie everyone will enjoy.<br />Colin Nickell
B00000K19E|4.0|This movie is awesome, but I felt the need to deduct a star because of an inconsistance in the movie.  This problem occures when Cypher makes a deal with the &quot;Machines&quot; Cypher goes into the matrix and has a sitdown meeting with the agents.  The problem is you can't get into the matrix from the ship, without an operator, who monitors everything that is going on around you in the matrix.  That means someone else on board was in on the sell out to the Matrix, or it is a bloop in the film!  Most people I've talked to hadn't noticed this slight problem, but after pointing it out I see the light bulb appear over thier heads.  Overall this is a great movie, Awesome special effects, great acting, Solid plot except that one blooper.  Buy it, and love it. It is a work of art.
B000002IM7|5.0|King's X are one of the most soulful,original and prolific rock bands on the planet. Why they underachieve commercially so consistantly and seem to garner very little in the way of a massive fan base is beyond me, but lets not get into that here. First up, this is simply one of the strongest debut albums ever laid down by a rock band. There, said it. Now, dont get me wrong, it's not perfect by any means, but to hear a band sounding this mature and proffesional on a first album is very rare and extremely pleasing. Describing the King's X sound is pretty difficult. They just sound far too much like King' X, and not enough like anyone else. There are hints of Rush, The Beatles, Metallica...some of the material here even reminds me of early Alice in Chains, although King's X predate the grunge explosion by a few years. Of course, I cant really categorise them either: we have summery, sublime melodies absolutely dripping with incredible harmonies, we have Ty tabor's tasteful and restrained chords, delicate arpeggios and sitar licks, and we have Doug Pinnick's astonishing, gospel tinged and soulful voice. All of this is distilled together under the mantle of spiritual lyrics which spring from a christian theology, but never preach and fit the music perfectly, as well as adopting a musical direction that is almost progressive, but is never indulgent.<br />Tye choruses and melodies here are fantastic: 'Shot of Love' speeds into the brain and the chorus seems necessary, as if the sounds were there in your brain, only waiting for the band to unleash them. 'Goldiloxs' is beautiful, realhit material, with smooth harmonies. Heavier rockers like 'In the new age' and 'Sometimes' are funky and direct- and perfectly formed. 'Power of love' has a profound, clap along chorus, while 'Visions', the album closer, explores new ground with tempo changes underpinned by Gaskill's incredible rhythmic economy and precision.<br />So much praise, but no down side? The album may be almost too melodic for die hard metal fans, and a little too straightforward or popish for prog heads. what King's X achieve here is something more though- a middle ground that not only satifies and intrigues, but is indubitably their very own. if heavenly melodies and complex vocal harmonies are your bag, purchase this immediatley. Rock and metal fans should look no further for a concise introduction to a great band: just dont expect to love it as much as I did, you could be dissapinted.<br />Still, a rock classic.for die hard metal fans, and a little too straightforward or popish for prog heads. what King's X achieve here is something more though- a middle ground that not only satifies and intrigues, but is indubitably their very own. if heavenly melodies and complex vocal harmonies are your bag, purchase this immediatley.

B00005YW4H|5.0|What can I say about this album that has not already been said?  I can't get enough of this album.  It is perfect in every way.  Her voice is so soothing and the songs are very well written.  Each song tells a poignant story.  I would highly recommend this album!!
B00006879E|5.0|I first heard Hard to Breathe on the radio and did not know who the group was so I searched on the internet. I found it was Maroon 5 and searched for their CD. Found it on Amazon and it is one of the best group of songs I have heard in a long time. The lead singer definitely has a sound unique to him and you will recognize it right away. They do have a recurring sound in their music, but it works!
B0000541AM|5.0|THIS MOVIE HAS EVERYTHING A GREAT MOVIE NEEDS: ACTION, CHASE SCENES, FIGHT SCENCES, ROMANCE, AND EVEN A LITTLE HUMOR. ANYONE WHO HASN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE SHOULD. THE MOVIE DOENS'T DWELL ON THE VIOLENCE, BUT SHOWS THE TREASURES OF LOYALTY OF FRIENDSHIP. THESE KIDS FIGHT FOR THEIR LIVES THE WHOLE MOVIE. IT REALLY GOES TO SHOW YOU HOW FRIENDSHIP PULLS YOU THROUGH TRIALS.
0671004107|5.0|I saw the movie first.  Having been a Sagan admirer since before adolescence, I knew there would be ideas of enormous complexity and scope presented in a language that was accessible to almost any reasonably intelligent person.  It took less than a half hour of the movie for me to know without hesitation that it had been drastically dumbed down from a book I hadn't even read.  I bought the book the next day and will never bother with another film adaptation of Sagan ever again (and will be hard pressed to justify seeing anything made by those who defiled Sagan in this movie).<BR>There are three profound strengths to this book, and the movie only got close to approximating one of them:<BR>1) The translation of elaborate concepts and hypotheses of physics and astronomy into lay terms.  This is the only area where the film even made a notable attempt.  But they still didn't even pretend at nailing it the way the book did.<BR>2) The discourse between science and religion.  Sagan explored this enduring quandry with a fairness, maturity and intellectual honesty that few authors (and probably no filmmakers) have ever achieved.  He also explored the debates with a sense of drama and nuance, while the filmmakers focused more on the fact that the debates were occuring between pretty people with sexual chemistry/tension.  Shame.<BR>3) The Arroway character was one of the most complete and believable characters I have ever read and, to be frank, the first female lead character I have ever connected with in any way.  She was strong and brilliant and confident and hungry while remaining distinctly female and even vulnerable at times.  This could only have been achieved by an author with an innate shared passion and sympathy for his character's purpose - in this case science and the search for the answers to some of the ultimate questions about life.  The movie made her a sanctimonious whiner.  Most of the rest of the characters were tragically dumbed down too.<BR>I recommend youread this book.  Two or three times.  And don't bother with the movie.
0783229364|4.0|This is one of my favorite MJF movies.  It captures the essence of what made him so popular as an actor.  There were no LOL scenes, except maybe at the end, but lots of broad smiles while watching it.
B00004YTIQ|1.0|This cover actually measures 144\\" (12 feet) by 76\\" (6 feet), which makes it way too big for the pool I have.  I paid as much for shipping as I did for the product, and the shipping costs are not refunded upon return. It would be an \\"OK\\" cover for a pool that size, but not for smaller ones.  The plastic is thin, and the rope ties slide under the pool, not around it, which lets all kinds of bugs crawl under the cover and into the pool.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|I finally got around to picking up the Van Halen remasters.  This album still sounds as fresh as it did when it was released back in 1978.  The great thing here obviously is Eddie Van Halen's guitar playing.  \\"Eruption\\" is still one of the best instrumental rock tracks ever of course.  And the solo on \\"Running With The Devil\\" is second to none.  The rhythm section of Michael Anthony and Alex Van Halen is signature.  You can tell this band by the drums and base as well as the guitar.  Michael Anothy's background are one of the reason's I always loved this band.  Speaking of vocals David Lee Roth was never the best singer on earth but the guy had a lot of fun in this band and it shows on the recordings.  As for the songs themselves, all are top notch.  The lyrics are not the greatest but that was never the point of Van Halen back in the Roth era.  They are just about putting on a record or CD and having a lot of fun.  This recording excels at having a lot of fun.
B000002LJA|4.0|As one that has had as varied a career as Jones (jazz musician, movie composer, bandleader, mega-producer), it is logical that he would release an album that covered it all. 1989's &quot;Back on the Block&quot; was such an album.<br />Jones was able to call in a lot of &quot;markers&quot; for this is truly what one calls a &quot;star-studded&quot; assemblage of talent. Ray Charles, Chaka Khan, the Brothers Johnson, Take 6, legends Sarah Vaughan and Ella Fitzgerald, El Debarge, Barry White, Siedah Garrett, Al Jarreau, Howard Hewitt, Jennifer Holiday, James Ingram, Dionne Warwick, Luther Vandross and a then-unknown Tevin Campbell are just some of the vocalists that appear on the disc.<br />Also, the musicians assembled are just as impressive: Shelia E., Nathan East, Jerry Hey, members of Toto, Dizzy Gillespie, Steve Lukather, and pianist extraordinaire Greg Phillinganes, among others.<br />Incorporating rap into the mix, &quot;Q&quot; received able-bodied assistance from Ice-T, Melle Mel, Big Daddy Kane, and Kool Moe Dee.<br />As for the tracks themselves, the appeal is not only in the hits &quot;I'll Be Good to You&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow (A Better You, Better Me)&quot;, and &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; but in the other superlative tracks like the majestic &quot;Birdland&quot; and the pop-worthy &quot;I Don't Go for That&quot;.<br />&quot;Back on the Block&quot; is where lovers of great music want to be...and I am one of them.
B000088E6D|5.0|wow, what a wonderful voice, what incredible range, and wonderful control of each and every note.  This voice is what we have all been waiting years for.  He has finally arrived and we are all so very glad.  This is a wonderful c.d. with incredible arrangements and song choice.  David you are truly a genius, and Michael you have a voice that will take you to the very top.  We will be watching you at the grammy's taking all the awards that you can carry.    Can't wait for your next c.d.  Welocme to our hearts, you are truly candy to our ears....
B000007R1M|5.0|I think this film gets it's inspiration from the great German arthouse film, Metropolis. I know it's got a track on here called Metropolis. Whether it really connects with the film is another matter and I'm not saying that people should try and play the two simultaneously to see if I'm right or anything but it was just a thought.<br />Anyway as for the album....the music is as ever fantastic. The Model is my favourite song here as it sounds like a prototype for the future synth pop bands who were to be an inspiration for them.<br />By the way rumour has it that there is a new Kraftwerk album coming out. Finally there is something to be cheerful about
B00005JKCH|5.0|This movie was amazing (No wonder it made more than 400 million in the box office). This movie gave Batman, Daredevil, and even X-Men a run for there money. And it definitely will be better than the Hulk. Anyways, the acting in this was wonderfully done (Expecially Tobey Maguire). This movie is amazing and if you haven't seen it then you definitely need to. I can't wait for Spider-man 2!
B00008NG5V|5.0|I was casually flipping through my new issue of Guitar World Acoustic when I saw an article about Jack Johnson, relatively new singer/guitarist. I jumped when I saw that he was releasing a new album, On and On. Jack Johnson, although different, is the most melodic songwriter and guitarist since Dave Matthews hit it big with Under the Table and Dreaming. His music is beautiful. From the beginning to end, Jack states his thoughts on the world, people and issues in the minds of everyone. He sings about war and government on &quot;Symbol in my Driveway&quot; but he doesn't say the words war or government. He sings of a depressed streetwalker on the album's best song &quot;Taylor&quot; He uses his reggae influences on &quot;The Horizon has been defeated&quot; He sings about the industrial explosion all over the world in &quot;Traffic in the Sky&quot; and says how destructive our world is becoming and how nothing's sacred anymore on the &quot;Fall Line&quot;<BR>On and On is an excellent album because Johnson is such a good guitarist, and he writes intriguing lyrics about things he feels are right and wrong. He outdid himself on this one, and I prefer it to the excellent debut album Brushfire Fairytales. The countdown has once again begun for me. I'm waiting for another Jack Johnson album.
B000001FFR|5.0|In 1985 New York based Anthrax relased Spreading the Disease. Heavily influenced by Iron Maiden and their manager Jon and Marsha Zazula's previous band Metallica, Anthrax combined thrash rhythymic sensibilities with melodic vocals and riffs born straight from punk.<br />Rhythym guitarist Scott Ian laid the foundation for a slab of metallic rhtythym by downpicking all his rhythyms just like Hetfield of Metallica while using the skin of his thumb to add thickness and texture to the riffs. Vocalist Joey Belladonna was the lone party man but offered melodic and diverse vocal ranges while the awesome rhythym tandem of Charlie Benante and Frank Bello set the framework for Ian and Dan Spitz's guitar intricacies.<br />The album opens with \\"A.I.R\\" which would become an Anthrax trademark using acronyms for songs. \\"Lone Justice\\", \\"Medusa\\", and \\"The Enemy\\" all utilize the Iron Maiden formula of using popular fiction, mythology, and history for song topics. The difference is Anthrax perform with virtuoso speed and precision with lead guitarist Dan Spitz ripping unconventional yet melodic solos to complement the versatile vocals of Belladona and punk backing vocals of Ian.<br />\\"Medusa\\" is simply an epic metal anthem with a classic riff and inspired vocals by Belladona. \\"Armed and Dangerous\\" opens with an ethereal and majestic clean picked passge only to evolve into a straight forward adrenalin blast of thrash. \\"Aftershcok\\" is an energetic thrasher and \\"A.I.R\\" has a memorable opening riff and great vocals from Belladonna. Anthrax had nearly reached the pinnacle of their abilities with this album and the debut of vocalist Joey Belladona. This is a thrash album that today sounds thin as far as production is concerned but is technically brilliant. In 1985 it was Atlantic records biggest thrash band and a landmark in production for speed metal and thrash bands during that era. Antrhrax went on to surpass this album with their masterpiece \\"Among The Living\\" but \\"Spreading The Disease\\"has long been recognized as an essential and devastating thrash album that should not be overlooked.
B000077VR3|3.0|This was the most disappointing musical I've seen in my lifetime.
B000002MJR|5.0|My last DS album is &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; so some of the songs in this live album (mine is a LD) are new to me.  DS performs flawlessly in this album but that is what makes this album a lack of outdoor live feel.<br />One guy that really catch my attention is Paul Frankin playing the steel guitar.  His riffs in &quot;Walk of Life&quot; is so tasteful that you will want to listen over and over again (even Mark Knopfler yells at him immediately once the song finished).  Other musicians are just great!
B00009TB5G|4.0|The only reason it gets a 4 from me is Shelob and a certain capture and the passing of the torch between wizards (so not to give too much away) was not in it.  Other than that this movie has the best battle scene I have ever seen in a movie.  Because I am LOTRs, I was captivated by this movie.  I actually shed a tear during the first movie while I was in the theater.  These movies are so well done in the department of scale, acting and of course the epic story.  And for those that thought it was a little brief during different scenes in The Two Towers, the extra 40+ minutes should help that out like in the extended Fellowship did.
B00009TB5G|5.0|This movie is absolutely one of the greatest movies ever made. This has a great story as well as great acting and amazing, I mean amazing special effects. Gollum is the best CGI character to date, no questions. Peter Jackson is doing a great job on bringing these films from book to movie. There is a difference between the movie and the book, but so what. To some movie goers 3 hours is way too long and if you put everything that was in the book in this movie, you would have WAY more than a 3 hour movie. This movie ROCKS and if you haven't seen it, DO SO! This Extended Version is going to be awesome (Just like The Fellowship Extended Version was). With up to 43 minutes of added seens, how can you go wrong in buying this. This is the ultimate DVD for Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers!
1577311523|5.0|This book really helped me find the fundamental truth of now.  You cannot deny the now, because it is always true, and life is always right now.  Living in this world with so many conflicting ideas, such as religion, sex, drugs, violence, war, politics, philantropy  money, career, etc..  It can be very easy for someone to be confused!  I've spent so much time questioning what is true and what is right, and I've never really come up with any real answers, all I get is more questions.  This can only lead to more confusion and possibly insanity.<br />This book gave me one truth: the present, a truth that I have denied for so long.  And this truth is not found by thinking what is true and right, but truth can be found by *not* thinking and just experiencing the now.  This book is a great motivator for begining the practice of meditation.
B000000WA4|5.0|I find is hilarious that people consider this album garbage. I would love to ask them to make a better album ; if they are so great at rating  recordings. Anyways.... GET THIS ALBUM. The genious that is bleeding through Billy's guitar and the rest of the band members mix together to make some of the best music ever made.
B00000016Q|5.0|When I think of this album I'm transported back to freshman year of high school in 1970 and having it playing in the background while doing homework, or harmonizing with my friends at slumber parties.  I loved it then and I love it now.  &quot;Maybe I'm Amazed&quot; is a classic and &quot;Junk&quot; is one of my all-time favorites.
0066620996|5.0|Should it come as a surprise that a thorough research project, which set out to find the combination of elements that businesses use to become great, discovered that great leaders maintain humility and will, that great companies seek to put the best people in the right places in their organizations, that the best people are not afraid to face the \\"brutal facts\\", that great strategic directions are established through understanding, that great organizational cultures are characterized by discipline and commitment, and that great companies employ technology intelligently not hastily? I would think not, yet somehow, Jim Collins' work (and the work of his sizable team of researchers) reads like a series of remarkable revelations, which provide insight on the processes of organizational greatness. What is perhaps most amazing about this work (and it is amazing in many ways) is how Collins and his team created such a simple and readable book about an utterly complex subject. <br /> Collins and his team set out to find what it takes to a make a great company. They measured greatness by a corporate performance. If a company's stock returns beat the general market by more three times over at least fifteen years after previously being at or below the market for at least fifteen years, it landed itself in the good to great category. Eleven companies made it onto the good to great list from the 1, 435 publicly traded companies that were initially evaluated. Once the eleven companies were identified, Collins' research team explored them and their comparison companies, which could have made the jump to greatness but didn't, to discover what they did that other companies didn't. The book is a detailed explanation of the six elements of greatness and how they contribute to a calculus of change, growth and improvement. This book will not disappoint anyone interested in organizational culture, leadership or change. It is loaded with personal and organizational stories from the good to great companies. Nor will it trouble anyone interested in research as Collins and his team include detailed explanations and analyses of their methodologies throughout the book and in an epilogue and appendix section of more than fifty pages. <br /> The good great leaders were all \\"level 5\\" executives. They combined personal humility with resolve. Comparison company leaders, while skilled and sometimes brilliant, lacked one or both of these leadership qualities. In ten of the eleven good to great companies, the level 5 leaders were hired from within the company. Not only did they bring knowledge to their work, but a fundamental passion for and love of the company and its goals. Good to great companies focused first on people and second on task. These companies sought to bring the best people to their quest. Often bringing in the right people meant not hiring the person with the most knowledge, but instead with the right combination of character traits. (\\"Good to great management teams consist of people who debate vigorously in search of the best answers, yet who unify behind decisions, regardless of parochial interests.\\" p. 63) The good to great leaders displayed unfailing courage in collecting and understanding data. Not driven by ego or idealism, the good to great leaders faced the facts and directed their companies accordingly. (In these companies a culture in which \\"people have a tremendous opportunity to be heard, and ultimately for the truth to be heard\\" (p. 88) was apparent.) <br />     The good to great companies all embraced \\"the hedgehog concept\\": an understanding about what they were deeply passionate; clarity about how to measure their bottom line; and a shared vision for what they could do better than anyone else. On average, it took four years for these companies to get to the hedgehog concept. Great people put the long term interests of the company ahead of their own short term goals. They exhibit \\"disciplined action\\" and are fanatical about adhering to the hedgehog concept. \\"A culture of discipline is not just about action. It is about getting disciplined people who engage in disciplined thought and who then take disciplined action.\\" (p.142) The people in the good to great companies respond to social and technological changes \\"with thoughtfulness and creativity\\" instead of being \\"motivated by fear of being left behind.\\" (p.163) (Of the eighty-four interviews conducted with leaders in the good to great companies, 80% didn't mention technology at all as one of the top five factors in their transition to greatness.) Interestingly, the good to great companies spent little if any time working on culture, commitment, or alignment. Great people participating in a dynamic calculus of change take care those problems naturally. \\"Alignment principally follows from results and momentum, not the other way around.\\" (p.187)<br />     This book will always have a special place on book shelf. While it is fascinating and instructive on many levels, it has provided nourishment for my soul. What it tells us is that great organizations and people are fundamentally good.
6302548195|5.0|The 1970's was definitely the halcyon days of international bodybuilding...two forward thinking brothers, Ben & Joe Weider, took a novelty sport, propelled it to stellar heights, built a publishing & business empire and gave the phrase \\"pumping iron\\" respectability and recognition worldwide. However, the Weider's would never have been as successful, if it had not been for a brash, young, quick talking bodybuilder from Austria (with a super hero, chiselled physique ) named Arnold Schwarzenneger who was the \\"golden boy\\" of bodybuilding's golden age.<br />This tremendous documentary primarily follows four elite bodybuilders in their lead up to the 1975 Mr Universe & Mr Olympia titles in Pretoria, South Africa. Mike Katz, Ken Waller, Lou \\"The Hulk\\" Ferrigno & Arnold Schwarzenneger are all shown training hard, posing down and attempting to psych each other out in the quest for the sport's top prizes. Also featured in the film are some of the other key identities from bodybuilding in the 1970's...Ed Corney, \\"The Black Prince\\" Robbie Robinson, Danny \\"The Giant Killer\\" Padilla, \\"The Sardinian Superman\\" Franco Colombu, Frenchman Serge Nubret & Frank Zane. George Butler's intriguing film is based around the book of the same name by fitness author Charles Gaines, who also wrote the novel \\"Stay Hungry\\" that was filmed a year earlier to \\"Pumping Iron\\" with a young Schwarzenneger as bodybuiler, Joe Santos !<br />Butler's probing camera focus's very much on the psychological aspects of the sport and much of \\"Pumping Iron's\\" running time is shown on the behind the scenes issues and mental preparation by the athletes and all important confidence boosting by their family and peers. Especially interesting is the intensely close relationship between ex-NYC cop Matty Ferrigno and his shy 24 year old son Lou, as the two ferociously train and methodically prepare to topple untouchable Arnold off his perch as the world's number one bodybuilder. However, we soon see why Arnold achieved theheights of fame and numerous titles, as he psychologically dismantles his opponents confidence and rattles their faith with his laid back & unnerving comments on their physiques !<br />Although \\"Pumping Iron\\" looks a little dated (lots of flared pants and bad haircuts), it is easily the best documentary ever made on competitive bodybuilding and is still compulsive viewing for anyone genuinely interested in one of the oldest, and often most mis-understood sports on the planet !
006092988X|5.0|You can see, hear, and taste Brooklyn in the early 1900's while reading this book. I connected with Francie, the heroine, on the first page and loved her by the time I reached the end. I finished the book last night and must find a new book to fill the feeling of vacancy in my heart today. While it's pretty hard to impress me these days, this book made it onto my 'absolute favorite, must read list' of books...please don't miss this one.
B00008J4P5|5.0|Elephant is a great album, definetely better then the others. It truly shows how the White Stripes have improved over time. This is probably the best album i bought the entire year. I probably bought about 120 albums. It has a great variety of genres. My personal favorites are I just Dont Know What To Do With Myself&amp;Youve got her in your Pocket&amp;The Air Near My Fingers&amp;I want to be the boy to warm your mothers heart<BR>and hey just because their a two person band doesnt make them any less then a 4 person one. it just shows how good they really are if they can make an album like this. which truly defines. rock n roll
B00006FXB6|5.0|The reviews don't lie...This one rocks. A great original sound and just pure rock 'n roll. This album made me a fan!
0684833395|5.0|What more can be said about &quot;Catch-22?&quot;  It's one of those classics that is such a staple, you grow up with it as a part of the cultural fabric.  As a student of literature and culture, I think it's an absolutely brilliant satire; as a sarcastic person with an odd sense of humor, I find it immensely pleasurable to read and re-read.  The first time around, it can seem pointlessly bizarre, and it's easy to lose sight of the fact that satire is an extremely difficult genre to pull off well.  And &quot;Catch-22&quot; pretty much wrote the book (no pun intended) on satire.  What's frightening is how prescient it is, how uncomfortably close to truth satire is.  Re-reading &quot;Catch 22&quot; during the war with Iraq is a supremely creepy experience.  But I guess that speaks to how important it is as a work of literature.  If you haven't read it, you should.  If you have, you should read it again.
B000066NW0|5.0|If you like rock or pop this cd is for you. Avril Lavigne is great. She came out with a new set of style and wasn't afraid to show it. Hers songs are great. She has a lot of talent. She also writes her own songs. Instead of selling her body like Brittany does and Christina she is different and thats what I like. Her songs are fun to lissen to and you wont get sick of it. Its music to my ears. One of the Best young stars I think in the music group anyways.
B000084T18|5.0|all right he might not be the best rapper or lyrasist in the rap industry but he can sure make his own, after coming out of the underground \\"world\\" stepping into the rap \\"world\\" competing against rappers like eminem, nas, jay-z, nelly, etc. he sure did his mark by selling something around 1.4-1.5 million albums in the FIRST WEEK!! I mean i'm not tryin' to put 50 down because he's not the best i'm just tryin to tell you that you can't really compare him to 2PAC or DRE just yet. So in conclusion if you like hardcore/gangsta rap(EMINEM, 2PAC STYLE) then 50 CENT'S GET RICH OR DIE TRYIN' is the way to go but if your more into light rap or \\"happy\\" rap then this is'nt the best choice<BR>                                                     PEACE
6305499365|5.0|Anyone who has ever worked in a corporate setting can relate to this movie.    It gives a funny glimpse into what REALLY goes on in an office..from the point of view of the &quot;worker bees&quot; (aka peons).  This is one of my favorite movies!
B00004TCPJ|4.0|In 1978, pianist Vladimir Horowitz played his Golden Jubilee concert at Carnegie Hall.  I remember buying the original Red Seal vinyl album of this concert. The dynamic range was astounding, at least until I wore the grooves out. The dynamics of this CD, however, don't match what I remember---they seem a bit flat. Still, I was happy to see this recording had been reissued on CD, and in an audiophile 24/96 edition. <br />Everyone was &quot;on&quot; for this concert: Horowitz's performance is outstanding, and the orchestra is superb. Some might quibble that certain parts of this recording were re-recorded to correct mistakes, but I'd rather not here the sour notes, as they tend to ruin my appreciation of the piece.<br />To fill out the CD they added Horowitz's recording of Rachmaninoff's Sonata No. 2, which is not my favorite piece.  Something isn't right; it just doesn't fit either the spirit or the mood generated at the Golden Jubilee concert.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I had never seen a &quot;disturbing&quot; movie until now. And boy, was I floored! Darren Aronofsky directed this inspirational and powerful adaptation of Hubert Selby Jr.'s acclaimed novel. <br />Ellen Burstyn gives one of cinematic history's greatest performances as Sara Goldfarb, a woman addicted to many things (mostimportantly: speed and television). Burstyn's descent into hell is as impactful and painful to watch as anything I've ever witnessed.<br />Jared Leto is amazing as Sara's devoted and loving son, Harry. Harry is basically a good kid who, unfortunately, is hooked on heroin. Jennifer Connelly is breathtaking as Harry's mesmerizing girlfriend, Marion. Marlon Wayans is rather impressive as Harry's best friend, Tyrone.<br />All of these characters will meet their inevitable fate, but it the viewer's privelege to be taken along for the ride.<br />I give this remarkable movie a strong, strong 5-star rating! A MUST-SEE for anyone who has ever had a dream that they feared of losing.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I am in a film class and Ive never seen, Pi or Requiem and my professor showed us this movie and... this is the best movie in the world. Its so beautifuly edited like when they take the drugs its a repeditive thing to show how repeditive it is. Darren Arrenofski is probably one of my new favorite directors ...
0446677450|1.0|Not sure about RD/PD, but one thing's for sure -- The author is laughing all the way to the bank!
0312305060|5.0|Very touching story. <br />A good use of a literal reference to connect stories of women in different ages. All of them are trying their best to chase the dream, love and so on.<br />It's much better than the movie!
B000002JSN|5.0|I got turned on to Zep very early on in my life and at the time this was probably my favorite Zep album.  It is still one of my favorites today.  Not only are the four individauls at their best, the recording quality of this one is remarkable.  Add to that the diversity of the material and you have a winner.  Among the standout tracks are In The Light, The Wanton Song, Down By The Seaside, Sick Again, Custard Pie,.....oh heck all of them!  For a double album, it amazingly will hold your interest from start to finish.  That is something to be said!!  Never had the CD, only the album and THAT sound quality was great.
B00005YU1O|4.0|&quot;Waking Life&quot; is not a film for everyone. In fact, in my opinion it's not a film for almost anyone.  That is not to say I don't recommend it, because I do.  I think this is a film that everyone should see, but I would be ridiculously idealistic to say that most people would enjoy or even be interested in what &quot;Waking Life&quot; has to say.  Ironically enough, one of the main themes of the film is the need to &quot;wake&quot; people who have become complacent, it's just that those type of people are the same ones who probably couldn't make it through fifteen minutes of this film without literally falling asleep.  It's a real shame, but the simple fact of the matter remains that the attention span of today's average movie audience is just not equipped to handle this film.<br />&quot;Waking Life&quot; is not really so much a film in the traditional sense as it is a series of philosophical discussions, a montage of people sharing ideas and seriously exploring all facets of life.  There is really no plot, only the wanderings of the protagonist as he navigates his way through a surreal dream state, taking in the things that the various characters he meets have to say.  I myself found this series of theories and intellectual meanderings both fascinating and stimulating.  The film's animation also serves to increase the feeling of wonder and discovery as it perfectly creates a hallucigenic, otherworldly setting.  All in all, in a perfect world I would make &quot;Waking Life&quot; required viewing in the hopes that it could &quot;wake&quot; some people up and start them thinking.  Okay, I have reached my limit on puns so until next time...
B00009TB5G|5.0|Ok, you have to see this movie, if not for the story than because the guys in it are so freaking cute!
B00009ATKS|4.0|Mogwai's albums have often suffered in comparison to their EP's; the music seems to maintain it's focus better over a shorter release. Rock Action, Mogwai's last album was pretty much an EP, with only 9 tracks and 6 proper songs, the rest being short interludes. Well I think they have finally released an album that matches their EP's. <br />Happy Songs... is not a long album, but Mogwai maintain the intensity and beauty over it's whole length, without have to resort to those glorious noisy peaks of their early career. Happy songs... shares EP's habit of not being overtly loud and distorted. Instead the distortion is buried ala Rage:Man, and only Ratts Of The Capital really stretches out to over 5 minutes. But the rest of the album is all quality stuff; I'd say no filler. Kids Will Be Skeletons is one of the absolute beauties on this album, and is up there with Helicon 1 as one of my favourites.<br />Mogwai have not really changed their formula. They still start with a simple melody and embellish it until the song ends. What they have done is refine the formula away from crescendos to a more textured method; the songs seem to increase in mass, not just volume. Gladly, one thing that remains is the number of jawdropping moments, the ones that stop you in your tracks and send a shiver down your spine. While this is a more subdued Mogwai, they are no less fierce.
B000068TPN|5.0|This is a wonderful movie. Mel Gibson's character is great and he does a very convincing job playing it. Though a take-off of the book, &quot;We were soldiers once...And young,&quot; it's proven itself independantly entertaining and realistic. I laughed, I cried, and I cheered.<br />If you like war movies, you'll love &quot;We Were Soldiers.&quot;
B000002J0P|5.0|This is an AWESOME album (I call cds \\"albums\\")! Every SINGLE song is a gem! What more can I say?
0345440900|2.0|I've listened to the first few chapters of this book and have decided not to waste my time with the rest. Hogg's advice about trying to establish structure, respecting the baby, re-creating the womb in order to soothe ...this is all good, but it's nothing new. For the most part it's pretty instinctive. Do we (even new parents) really need to be TOLD to do all these things?These are natural, loving responses that parents will find themselves exhibiting right away if they have accepted the responsibility of becoming parents. Hogg seems to be directing her advice to parents who still aren't quite sure if they want to shoulder the task, and who are looking for shortcuts and convenience. Well, guess what: that's why having a baby is a life-changing experience, folks ...because you HAVE to accept that your life will be irreversibly changed. There are NO shortcuts! Hogg's advice is like fast food: it's in handy-dandy 4-piece (4-step) packages with snappy, appealing names like EASY and SLOW. This is very misleading and does new parents a great disservice. I believe babies SHOULD be rocked and sung to sleep, and nursed to sleep if they (and mom) want...nighttime parenting is just as important as daytime parenting. Rocking, singing, and nursing at bedtime is a wonderful way for the parent, not just the baby, to wind down and relax too. Intimacy grows slowly from all  those hours invested in parent-to-baby physical contact that ultimately produce a happy, secure baby and parent. And no parent should ever feel bad about sleeping with your baby. Banishing the baby to the crib from day one is an unnatural expectation that is very popular in American culture but certainly not universal. If mom and baby both sleep better when cuddled together ...why not do it? Why the rush to isolate him from those who are his ENTIRE world in those early months - his parents? When baby is ready for his own space he will seek it out one way or another. The breastfeeding advice is nothing short of shocking, and it worries me that many new moms might be discouraged from even attempting it after reading Hogg's negative write-up. I agree with Hogg that breastfeeding doesn't work for everyone, and that moms who choose otherwise should never be made to feel bad about it. But what bugs me is  how she so easily dismisses or just doesn't even mention the incredible advantages that mother's milk gives a growing baby. For mothers who can do it, it is one of the greatest gifts you can give to your child. Hogg is the ONLY child care professional I have ever encountered who actively discourages it. That's a real shame. New parents - if you read this one, please also read Dr. Sears' excellent books, and pick and choose (from all sources) what works best for YOU without feeling guilty or coerced.
6304806442|5.0|Trainspotting is a film that remind me of the time when we were young, and not so green. Plaesure to watch and compare your life with what it could've looked like, if you made a step away from the path. It's not violent and agressive, it's just a piece of art that makes all us, British People be proud of. Knowing that the comparison is not quite acuarate, I'll say that it's like having Grease for the Americans. <BR>I definately advise everyone to see it, you'll just love (and not only because of the scene when Ewan McGregor dives into the toilet), but because of the scence that this film gives you: if you're older a scence of regret and nostalgia; and if you're young- it's just a must see movie, you'll find out why....
B00008OWZC|4.0|My only real complaint - what happened to the CD cover?<br />Led Zep were known as the band with cutting edge, deep, otherworldly, album covers.  First the BBC treatment, then this. Oh dear.  They shoulda hired the bootleg designers.  But never mind.<br />It's 1972.  Immigrant Song comes blasting in after LA Drone.  Nice.  The time trip has begun.  The band can generally do no wrong, and I'm happy the fans finally got a good live album.<br />The mix is however muddy - I agree with my fellow reviewers below. In that respect, The Song Remains the Same soundtrack has far greater clarity (i'm not kidding) and atmosphere.  But this one has the vocal chops of Robert Plant and the complete set.<br />Some impressions:<br />Over the Hills and Far Away - a beautiful song worth getting the album for alone as one guy says below...<br />Since I've Been Loving You is Plant improvising I think because he's getting bored with the song...<br />Stairway to Heaven - I still prefer TSRTS version....<br />But these are minor foibles.  What else needs to be said? Go to california and enjoy!!<br />PS I implore Jimmy to come up with more live music.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Pay no attention to the Cranky Reviewer, she knows nothing (I assume she's a teenage girl, judging by the music she does like).<br />This DVD set is fantastic, as is the CD set HOW THE WEST WAS WON.<br />The picture and sound quality are both excellent. The rare footage was a treat to see, also. Having attended several Zeppelin concerts myself, I could only see these images in my memory, until now. I highly recommend both the DVD and CD sets.
B000063COX|5.0|This album hardly is mentioned when speaking about Maiden discography,specially by american press who tend to think the best of Maiden is Powerslave and The number of the beast,maybe because they charted high there and normally for american press chart high means very good.Their debut never charted there so they may think is very bad.....How wrong.Powerslave and Number have some great songs and some of my favourites too ,but also filler material,specially powerslave(half good,half bad)\\"Iron Maiden\\" in the other hand doesnt have filler,every song counts here and also have some of the really best of Maiden like phantom of the opera(maybe the best of the pack),strange world,transylvania,prowler,iron maiden,etc.So,to the people out there thinking they probably got the best of Maiden just having the dickinson era you are very wrong,don't listen what kerrang or mags of the style say(sold out mags by the way...),listen to \\"Iron Maiden.It is not for complete your Maiden collection,its the best of the collection and everyone who likes maiden should have it.Essential.Rock on!!!!!!! \m/
0743244249|4.0|Much like Nietzsche's, Delillo's writing hits hard, blunt truths which may not resonate as you first read them, but seem to subltly speak to something beyond. This is not to say that Delillo is a flagrant cynicist or ironist. I find him way too dry for that. Not that that is a negative statement, in my opinion. Nevertheless, this book promises more than many reviewers gave it credit for. The territory may not be brand-spanking new, but the story is compelling, rather intriguing and has some nice twists in it. Minor characters don't get their due, but the main character provides enough reason to read on and the antagonist (in the looser sense of the word) also serves as a nice tangent from the main vein of the narrative. What continues to compell me about Delillo is his need to depict, as if by camera, what is happening in his novels, through his crisp sentences. His prose is almost geometric, the way it sets up angles and perspective. Almost every sentence is like a cross-section of the culture we live in. Because his novesl are embedded in history, I believe we may be looking back at Delillo in 40, 50, 75 years from now, trying to see \\"what it was really like\\" back then. Like a timecapsule in a book.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Absolutely incredible album. I have recommended it to all my friends. Even at my age (42) this album just rocks! Christina's voice is perfect and the range - wow!
B000092ZYX|3.0|Another good radiohead CD, but the words &quot;endless droning&quot; come to mind when listening to it.<br />If you put all their CD's in a CD changer, they would be almost indistinguishable from one another.<br />And what's with the annoying sounds they include in their songs. There's little electronic beeps and pops, in one song you get the joy of hearing the sound of a needle reaching the end of a record for the entire song. More annoying than innovative.<br />But if you like Radiohead, you won't be disappointed.
B00000JZJ0|5.0|I thought that I saw it all in \\"Re-Animator\\", but director Brian Yuzna (\\"Return of the Living Dead 3\\" and \\"The Guyver\\") returned with the best script and cast that I have ever asked for for a sequal of one of the two best horror films ever made (\\"Re-Animator\\" and \\"The Evil Dead\\"), making this one of the two very best \\"B\\"-movie sequals ever made.
B00008OWZC|4.0|I agree with the glowing reviews for most of this album. But, someone out here has to be the voice of reason when it comes to some of the songs on these discs.  It is undeniable that L.Z. was a great band.  Had one of the best rhythm sections of any rock band, ever.  This collection is a fine example of their greatness and a nice addition to their overall catalog.  That being said though, 70's excess is in full effect on a number of the songs here.  As good as these discs are, they are also a great reminder of why punk had to happen. \\"Dazed and Confused\\" seems to go nowhere and at 25+ minutes is more than I can take.  The guitar solo during \\"Heartbreaker\\" with its' few bars of \\"classical\\" influence is an inertia stopper and funny to anyone who has seen Spinal Tap, (yes I know Zep came before \\"Tap\\").  And finally, the 19+ minutes of \\"Moby Dick\\"...well what really needs to be said about a 20 minute drum solo.  \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" at 23+ minutes escapes this criticism as it works, it DOES go somewhere, and is tough as nails at times. So, for those of you who have listened to music that was made after 1975, this is a good, and at times great, collection that ultimately suffers from its' time and place as well as yours.
0140177396|1.0|Wow, this book really [is bad]...But in M&M Steinbeck gets down-right nasty. This little gem of stink can be summarized, \\"Isn't it tragic that in this world there are just some people that we need shoot like the old stinky dogs that they are, but thankfully we have good friends who will love us enough to do the murdering.\\"<br />That's profound? There's nothing profound about that. It's silly, misguided and sentimental to be sure. It's also evil. But it's certainly not profound.<br />Now it might be that Steinbeck hates the world and hates George and hates what George does and that M&M is an anguished cry against an unjust world. However, this secret message is unlikely to be discerned from the text and the average reader will come away thinking, \\"It's jus' too bad that sum folks is better off not bein' born'd.\\" This is clearly the impression the book makes upon most Amazon reviewers. And even if the message of the book were \\"life [is bad]\\" instead of \\"murder the less fortunate\\" it would hardly salvage this vile little creation.<br />...It has its share of ham-fisted heart-string pulling and the occasional pastoral description of a shrubbery or a creek, but that's just not enough to make the painful few hours wasted upon its pages worthwhile...
B00005QG9J|5.0|Incubus is one of my favorite non-metal bands and this cd is easily their most experimental one.   I have all their cds and I enjoy each one.  I love how with each album they change their sound.  Fungos Amongus was very funk filled, science was pretty much a metal cd, make yourself was alternative hard rock, and this one?  well, what is this?<br />The band has taken a more laid back approach to their music.  There is still plenty of rockers here but even then they are not has heavy as their old stuff.  Imagine a perfect sunny day with a slight cool air to it, like the cover.  This album is the soundtrack for that day.<br />Brandon's voice still sounds the same, full of emotion and a few suprises.  Guitar player has become very comfortable with playing acoustic and it shows.  What I like about this cd, and about incubus, that they never bore you.  They have the amazing ability to write catchy songs, even the slow ones are catchy.  As with any incubus cd you would except lots of different styles and many suprises.  track's 4 and and the last track will give you that in spades.  <br />All in all, a very diverse cd that i highly recommed to people who like rock.
0066620996|5.0|What? Ethics and business?  Yes!<br />What Jim Collins has done fits squarely in the Aristotelian model of ethical discourse.  Despite his misgivings about Philip Morris and the issue of smoking (he's a health nut), the great companies he describes are models of flourishing human communities with clear standards of behavior and honesty.  One could even say that the people in great companies love their companies and their coworkers in those companies.  His methodology reminds us of the loss we suffered when Aristotle's collection of constitutions went missing.  For serious readers, a comparison with Alasdair MacIntyre's After Virtue and Whose Justice, Which Rationality would be most rewarding.  Both authors are on to something regarding traditions, practices, critical thinking, and the goods to be achieved in flourishing communities.  There are lessons in this book for those who believe that good management and good ethics are somehow different.  The moral value of Level Five leaders begs for wider consideration.  Marrying ethics to success in business would really be revolutionary!
B000002UA9|4.0|It is hard to imagine how the Beatles could have started their LP recording career any better than this.   From Paul McCartney's opening &quot;1-2-3-fo-ah!&quot; to John Lennon's monumental delivery of &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;, this is the Beatles stage show, done in studio.  Very few studio tricks on this CD, other than some double-tracking.   And we also hear, right from the beginning, that the band's self-composed songs (credited to &quot;McCartney-Lennon&quot; on this CD before the names were switched for the remainder of the Beatles' career) were at least as good as the cover versions they performed.   &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot;, for example, is such a great song that John Lennon sang it over a decade later, when he appeared on stage with Elton John in his last ever public performance. And the title track, &quot;Please Please Me&quot; is still one of my favourite Beatle songs.  Released earlier as a single (and the Beatles' first number one song in the UK), this is probably the song that erased producer George Martin's doubts about the band's new drummer -- Ringo's work on this song showed he had an instinctive feel for what a song needed.  Ringo had only recently replaced Pete Best, and Martin gave him a tambourine to rattle on their first single &quot;Love Me Do&quot;, while he turned the drumsticks over to sessionman Andy White.  That's the version we hear on this CD, and you have to say it's a crisper recording than the version found on THE BEATLES PAST MASTERS VOL 1, on which Ringo drums.   Starr gets a moment to shine in the vocal spotlight, and he belts out &quot;Boys&quot; in terrific style.  George's vocal showcase, on the other hand, wasn't his best.  He sounded a bit nervous on &quot;Do You Want to Know a Secret&quot;, and he was rather swamped by echo.  But it's still a decent recording -- and did very very well as a single in the US when Beatlemania broke several months later.  Among the other highlights:  John's excellent performanceof &quot;Baby It's You&quot;,  John and Paul's duet on &quot;There's a Place&quot;, and of course -- the showstopper -- &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;.  The Lennon Larynx was never more severely tested -- and I can just imagine what the recording staff up in the booth must have thought when they heard it coming through their headphones.  I've read one of the engineers took copies of it around the office the next day saying &quot;would you listen to this??&quot;.
B00008977N|4.0|One of the better live concert mixes I now own.  Obviously lots of post-processing.  But I don't mind as long as it sounds great.  Wonderful balance of the instruments and vocals.  DTS rocks as always.<BR>If you can look past the mediocre video quality...then this is a fun disc to own.  Talented musicians.  I think Paula Cole is especially wonderful.  Check out &quot;Don't Give Up&quot;.  Stellar performance.<br />If only they would have used high-def cameras...

0385509456|4.0|Mark Haddon combines keen observation of the autistic mind with empathy for the reader to bridge the abyss between the average Joe and his autistic neighbor.  This book grabs the imagination long enough to explain autism to the disgusted and unsympathetic. Parents and caregivers of autistics will enjoy the surprisingly funny, bittersweet story before lending it out to their relatives and friends.  Policymakers and citizens who want to steer autistic kids toward a useful life and away from writing Unabomber Manifestos and blowing people up should check out this book for its insights.  Genuine autistic writings usually irritate without reaching their readers.  Haddon has managed the autistic protaganist in first person without being untrue to his subject or unkind to his audience.
B00000016K|5.0|As I sit here listening to Spoonful for about the let me see 33 years times 365 days sometimes a few times a day and it still makes my day what can I say. Spoonful contains the best 5 minutes of music ever created! Doubt me? Listen for yourself. Start at the 2:50 mark and listen until the 7:50 mark. It starts nice and slow. Clapton contols the tempo as he plays melodically.<BR>Ginger soon calls the band to action with his Cymbal. Clapton revs up the engines. Jack Bruce alternates lines with Clapton on his Bass. They begin down the runway increasing speed. Then they take off through new horizons music was never taken before and they keep going for the next few minutes until they seem to climax. And just at the peak when you wonder what's coming next Clapton takes it into overdrive. It's like the Starship Enterprise going into Warp drive. This is the music that put Clapton light years ahead of everyone else. I've heard all the great guitarists, no doubt they're great players and I love their music but this is truly God at work. <BR>As for the rest of the Disc well, most know Crossroads as the staple of Classic rock stations. Believe me Spoonful is much better but at 15 minutes plus you just won't hear it on the radio. The better studio songs are the classic White Room and Sitting on Top of the World, a redone blues song with Clapton's guitar sounding like a little like a wailing trumpet. The rest aren't as great but they're not bad either. What's the difference, Spoonful is worth the price of admission on its own. If you haven't heard Spoonful yet lucky you, you get to discover this gem for the first time. It took me for or five listenings before knowing the rush and I've been listening ever since.
B00008PX8P|4.0|What I would have given for footage like this back in the stoned 70's!  Then, I would have stared tranfixed at what my older, jaded self sees now as icons of boomer self-indulgence.  Page bends to his Les Paul, long black hair streaming in front of him, or brings out the bow and goes for rock's answer to George Crumb.  Plant caterwauls and struts about like a schoolboy on the make.  Jones, bemused, standing by his amp, provides the solidest bottom in rock or keyboard work worthy of one of England's best studio musicians at the time (\\"Kashmir\\" from '79 at Knebworth).  Bonham lays down endlessly astounding backbeats and fills (\\"Moby Dick\\" from the Albert Hall concert is not to be missed!).  The audiences boogie or stare.  The band runs the gamut from rock pomp to impassioned performance to rote tedium to time-killing to pure magic, pausing occasionally to drag out songs like \\"How Many More Times\\" and \\"Dazed and Confused\\" (in the Albert Hall concert in 1970) with clever quotes or overdone call-and-response between Page and Plant.<br />Back then, these four enjoyed worldwide status as rock gods, living at the absolute pinnacle of popular stardom.  Bombast and pretentiousness notwithstanding, there was extraordinary virtuosity in the live Zeppelin.  In \\"White Summer\\" (again from the Royal Albert Hall concert) Page showed he could pick his a** off when he wasn't engaging in theatrics; there was no voice quite as electric as Plant's back then; and Jones and Bonham prove again and again on this DVD that they were world-class players.  The extras from TV and promos are also fun.  A fortunate aggregation of musicians for the time.  A wild ride!
B00005JKNB|5.0|This film weaves together the themes of \\"the movies\\", small town America and values like courage and selflessness. Peter Appleton is a Hollywood screenwriter with a bump on his head who comes out of his amnesia while seeing his own film in the newly renovated, small-town \\"Majestic\\" theater. The re-opened theater symbolizes the rejuvination of the entire town at his coming \\"back\\" to life after being MIA for 9 years. Will he return to his self-absorbed life or did the small-town values rub off on him? Hmmm . . . you could get the video or just read some of the following reviews to find the answer, but I would highly recommend doing the former.<br />The film could have been really hokey in attempting to portray \\"small-town\\" values, but the actors do an incredible job at seeming (I hate to use this word) \\"nice\\" without being smarmy. Jim Carrey should have been nominated for something: he gives a great performance. Martin Landau's moving tribute to \\"the pictures\\" (as he tries to talk Jim Carrey into helping him renovate the theater) was, well, very moving!  And no piano player should miss the scene where his former piano teacher tries to get Luke/Peter to play something classical but his fingers remember something entirely different. (In my opinion, that scene is worth the price of the entire movie.)<br />The ending was satisfying and fit right in with the themes and values of the rest of the movie. I'm sorry that it didn't do well at the box office; maybe it will be one of those sleepers that wakes up on cable and rental. I hope so! I wish there were more movies being made like this one.
B00005JLSE|5.0|The comments that Moulin Rouge pales in comparison are so right (and here I am an Australian saying that:)).     Baz hold the camera still please!<br />Chicago has it all - tremendous screen presence from the leading ladies, a surprising good \\"patter\\" song from Richard Gere, and the brilliant \\"Cellophane Man\\", not to mention the extended dance sequence \\"Jailhouse Tango\\" which has to be up there with the best filmed dance sequences.<br />And quite surprisingly its live action American satire that works because it is not self-concious.
B00005LB9O|5.0|I first heard cuts off this album after a lengthy search on kazaa for new music.  My friend who's music taste Id say is on par with my own sent \\"Sing\\" over MSN proclaiming it to be the next indie thing.  While sing wasnt the most complicated song writing I have heard, no not Rob Pollard by far, but it sparked my interest.  It sent me on the search for more.  I managed to collect almost every song from the album before finally going out and picking up the cd version of the album.  I rarely buy, mostly over cost, and lack of actual material, but this album has provided countless hours of enjoyment, taking the edge off work, and life in general.  The style of the music varies but does seem to carry the same flowing feel thoughout, and is expeically well executed in Pipe Dreams, Flowers in the Window, and The Cage.  Some agers in the indie scene might find the lyrics a bit dissapointing, and I will admit, they are sometimes flaky (Sing always seems like only 5 words, repeated over and over,  though catchy).  Really, its only major flaw is that it tries only as much as it needs to succeed.  Its a cultured album, but not pretentious as some other relases can sometimes sound, such as some later Radiohead.  If your looking for on of those albums which you can recline back in your chair, nod your head, and actually realx to music for once, then pick this one up.  If your expecting something complicated, and startling like Guided By Voices however, you wont find it here.  Give it a shot, and be the cool indie kid on your block today.
B000056IKS|5.0|Although their exsistence only lasted four years and three albums, Neu! is one of Germany's most innovative supergroups. Formed from the ashes of an early line-up of Kraftwerk in 1971, guitarist Michael Rother and drummer Klaus Dinger soon set out to create music that was timeless and innovative. Over 30 years later, Neu's influence continues to be heard in many of today's bands from techno to experimental rock.<br />Neu's debut album opens with the 10-minute &quot;Hallogallo&quot;. This track is a finely crafted piece on minimalist-rock. The piece stays in one key throughout its entirety. Klaus Dinger's drumbeat is so perfect and simple, you'd almost think it came from a drummachine. Michael Rother adds some intricate guitar parts and backwards effects. This piece is perfect for driving.<br />&quot;Sonderangebot&quot; is an experimental piece consisting of processed cymbals and percussion fed through various phasers and flangers. This leads directly into the bluesy &quot;Wiesensee&quot;. This slow meditative piece is reminiscent of Pink Floyd (ie: Meddle and Obscured by Clouds). Rother plays some fine lead and slide guitar on this piece.<br />The &quot;Wiesensee&quot; theme is repeated in the following track &quot;Im Gluck&quot;. This is an early example of 'ambient' music consisting of a bowed-bass drone, water sounds and a seagull-like guitar lead. The beauty of &quot;Im Gluck&quot; get interupted abrupty by the loud power-drill sounds of the following piece &quot;Negativland&quot;. This 9 and 1/2 minute track is an early example of what was to be known as 'industrial' music. A throbbing bassline and Dinger's trancelike drumbeat set the pace while loud screeching guitars howl like raging beasts. The tempo changes consistently throughout this piece speeding up and slowing down at will and sometimes stopping completely. When it stops for the last time, the music cuts off midbeat followed by ten seconds of silence.<br />The closing track of the album &quot;Lieber Honig&quot; is the only downfall to what is otherwise a near-perfect album. Here, Klaus Dinger is heard strumming a Japanese banjo and singing. His voice is really nothing to sneeze at. It merely sounds like a young child attempting to talk or make noise. The hoarse annoying vocals get in the way of what sounds like a beautiful melody in the background. Fortunately, it's only for the first part of the track. Afterwards, we are treated to some of the same ambient sounds heard on &quot;Im Gluck&quot;.<br />Without a doubt, Neu! were and still are ahead of their time. With their three-album catalog now remastered and issued officially on CD for the first time, it is now clear that the music world has finally caught up with Neu's timeless innovations. This first album is definitely a must have and is a groundbreaking piece of German Krautrock.; is the only downfall to what is otherwise a near-perfect album.

B00005221L|3.0|This is a great movie, certainly the best of Schwarzenegger's career. They did a good job with the audio on the new release with the 5.1 DTS, however the video transfer could use a lot of help. It comes and goes, there are some sections of the movie that look OK, and others that just look bad. I guess this will give them another future release to sell that will be digitally remastered.
0066214122|1.0|Michael Crichton must have phoned this one in. I've never written a review before but I felt this novel was such a stinker I had to respond. I think I've read all his books. I look forward to a new Crichton novel but, holy suffering swarms of bugs, what a mess this thing is. Did his ex get this in the divorce settlement?<br />I listened to this on an audio tape. After about 3 of the tapes, I started to use the fast forward button to try and speed things up. I didn't help. I couldn't descibe the plot of this book this book because it's so stupid. Yea, we know about the swarms of bugs but that's just the beginning. The bugs evolve into people and some of the characters are really the bugs and it's all evolving so fast that you can't keep track of who's who (or want to). I really hate a suspense book that spends all it's time chasing around in circles. In this case it's swarming around in circles. Imagine the novel Cujo only with killer bees that morph into a vicious wife. I'm not making this up. I'm hitting the fast forward button every 5 minutes and nothing changes, it's just more ridiculous! <br />In the last chapter (I think it was the last chapter, my Walkman was getting low on batteries from the constant fast forwarding) Crichton has an Agatha Christy moment where he attempts to explain what's been going on for the last 12,000 pages. Thanks for that Michael, I was wondering about all those incredible loose ends and plot turns that one paragraph ties all together.  <br />Oh my God, is this book bad! Looking for a good summer read? Go read Cujo again. I least the bad dog doesn't turn in to a bad spouse.
B00008DDXC|4.0|I think the best thing about the Harry Potter movies is that they stay true to the book.  Upon watching both films in the theater, I noticed a bunch of young viewers reciting the lines along with the characters.  This was on opening day, so it's not like they'd already seen the movie.  The quiddich scenes are even better this time out.  I am a big fan of the novels and the movies.  Can't wait for the next one.
B00006I53S|5.0|While I considered purchasing a Canon 10D, I also started looking for a good first lens.  Most of the reviewers and Canonites on the various forums suggested this lens as a good starting point.    The 28-135mm IS USM Zoom is the one I use all the time now on the Canon 10D, and that will be the case until I get over the sticker shock of the 10D/28--135mm combo and start adding other lenses to my kit.    In the meantime, this lens gets the job done very well.  It gives you good range for a variety of of shots, from portraits to telephotos.  There is even a macro mode, which gives you the opportunity to do close-ups--not really a true macro, but okay for shots of flowers, your kitty cat's face, etc.  It is the flexibility of this lens that makes it so appealing if all you have is just one lens.  And remember that if you mount this lens on a digital camera, like the 10D, the range is actually extended by a factor of 1.6.    The USM focuses fast, and the Image Stabilization (IS) really works.  In fact, I've been spoiled by it, and IS is now a must for any of the longer lenses I might purchase in the future.    The IS system \\"locks\\" on target so that camera shake is eliminated or at least seriously minimized.  This means fewer shots ruined by camera shake, and the IS system allows the user to shoot handheld at slower shutter speeds.  This isn't just advertising hype.  It works.    The image quality is quite good.  I get good color saturation, contrast, and sharpness.  After tweaking some shots in Photoshop, I was able to turn out some excellent 13x19 inch prints.    As others have pointed out, if you are just starting out with a Canon DSLR or SLR and want one good general purpose lens, this is it.    As of August 2008 I have sold this lens because I have moved on to Canon \\"L\\" glass, but the EF 28-135 is still a great lens to start with if you are just beginning to learn photography.

0312983867|3.0|To put this review into perspective, along with my 3 star rating, I must state that I am a die-hard Janet Evanovich fan. However, after reading all of her Stephanie Plum series, one through eight, it is time for Ms. Evanovich to make some changes if she is to avoid the typical pitfalls of series books - the formulaic novel...and overkill. It is to her credit that she has kept readers eagerly coming back for more of Stephanie Plum, my all time favorite heroine. And while I do understand that series writers need to provide, (& to provide, & provide), the same background information so new readers will understand what is going on - the repetition is driving me crazy. We read the same jokes over and over again in each new book. They became tired 3 books ago. I don't mind rereading the facts. I do mind same old, same old. Enough! Just give us the basics about Steph's family, Grandma Mazur, Joe Morelli, (yes, he played choo-choo with her when they were kids), Ranger, Lula, Cousin Vinnie, (and yes, we have read at least 8 times about the animals), etc. Brevity in the face of tedium works. I am sure that the creative wit that conjured up the Plums, et. al., will be able to come up with new material in the future. If new readers would like to know more background, assuming they begin the series with book #9, they can read another book from 1 through 8. It's their fault if they begin with # nine, anyway.<br />The plot in \\"Hard Eight\\" is not as complex, or as interesting, as others. This simplistic storyline, along with the repetitious jokes, made this my least favorite of the eight books. I won't go into the details, others reviewers have already summarized the plot very well. I do not agree with those who say this is a darker story because of \\"the soupcon of child jeopardy\\" involved. There is no danger to a child here. The villains are especially tame and flat compared to Benito Ramirez, a real doozie, and other creeps from other bounty hunts!<br />I was glad that Ranger and Stephanie finally got together. We were left hanging in \\"Seven-Up,\\" with what seemed like sexus interruptus. I hate being left in the air about something as important as whether my fictional favorite has sex the with the \\"dark, mellow, mystery man\\" of her fantasies.<br />I really hope the next novel is more original and complex. Stephanie Plum is quite capable of multi-tasking. I also hope that Janet Evanovich loses much of the old material and comes up with something new and exciting.d Stephanie finally got together.

B000002W5J|5.0|It's an album that gave a generation some amazing music to listen to. It's an amazing album, with those 2 big hits from the Airplane; \\"Somebody To Love\\", and \\"White Rabbit\\", which were probably two of the many tunes being played on radios in San Francisco during the Summer Of Love (1967, for those who don't know their history). But it gave people something to think about, a rock and roll band incorporating so much different types of music into their sound, like folk, pop, jazz, and psychedelic influences. It's an amazing mix, folk musicians Marty Balin and Paul Kantner, rock vocalist Grace Slick, Blues enthusiasts Jorma Kaukonen and Jack Casady, and jazz-influenced drummer Spencer Dryden, add a little drugs, some long hair, and a little peace, and you get The Airplane.<br /><br />This album is an alluring bouquet of early psychedelic folk-rock that will make love to your ears. I recommend to anybody who just likes music.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This, seriously, is my favorite album of all time.  No other compares.  I can listen to it in any mood and enjoy it.  I think it sounds alot like Coldplay.  If you have an extra 12 bucks do yourself a huge favor and buy this record.
B000002U9W|5.0|It contains some music that actually is something you can hear, while doing what cow's do, sitting in a field.<br /><br />First is the title track: A step forward for Floyd. It's spectacular, a more down to earth rendition of the Moody Blues' \\"Days Of Future Passed\\" album, Rock and Roll with a classical taste, and with a little mellotron.<br /><br />Then we have \\"If\\", a Roger Waters tune: an acoustic guitar ballad that comes straight from the heart and says, \\"If you can Do better, Do better\\".<br /><br />Now we have \\"Summer '68\\", a Rick Wright tune: a song which talks about, what it's like to be in a band in the 60's. Touring, playing festivals (something Floyd never liked doing), meeting somebody in one town who you is probably very far-out, make love to her, and tell her that you will be leaving tomorrow, and you might never see her again, which for many musicians was on a daily basis.<br /><br />Now we are with \\"Fat Old Sun\\", a Dave Gilmour tune: This is probably the mellowest Floyd song to date. It talks about a very down to earth thing, springtime in an open field, listening to the church bells ring of a nearby town, birds singing, wind blowing, a beautiful sight when you think about it.<br /><br />Now we have our closing number, \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfest\\" which most people had between the years of 1967 and 1970. I think it has something to do with something the called LSD. But this actually contains real kitchen sounds performed by Nick Mason and Alan Stiles, one of the bands 2 roadies, who the song was named for. The song includes basically 3 songs seperated by these kitchen sound effects, a tune that sounds like something on the farm, a folk passage that fades in while the eggs are frying, and a rock and roll tune which really bring Rick Wright's keyboards into the frontline.<br /><br />It's an amazingly underrated album, perfect for any down to earth people who want to hear down to earth 60's rock and roll, You know who you are.
0345446798|5.0|Few books about dogs combine humor, training tips, psychology, compassion and love of dogs in the way that this book does and does it so dead-on right. It is also fun to read!  <BR>I've read her concepts in other dog training manuals but was never made to understand them the way Dr. McConnell brings to light, or relates them to canine/human differences in the clear way she teaches you to understand. Experts and novices with dogs alike would benefit from the knowledge gained by reading this book. Reading goes quickly and you are sad when the book comes to an end....what an awesome job she has done here and in my opinion, this is the best dog behavior book I have ever read. <BR>You are left wanting to not only meet this remarkable woman, but also her collection of dogs. Certainly if the dogs of our society could rate this book, they would give it the same as me, five stars! Or maybe that would be five barks.
B00008OWZC|5.0|This is a real live album, not like those KISS records with studio work and crowd noise added later. This is really recorded live. Every squeak of feedback and whine from the mike is present. The band is at it's best. This is classic. Zeppelin never made a classic live album in their heyday, but this more then makes up for it. They sound great. They are heavy as heck, and Page is in top form. They were not the first, and they were not the last, but Zeppelin was the BEST classic metal band ever. Forget Aerosmith, Sabbath, Purple, KISS, Guns N' Roses, and Van Halen. This is the band that dominates classic metal, and always will.
B00001OH7M|4.0|On his second album, there is very little of the David Bowie we know and love to be seen. Space Oddity is mostly acoustic. There is none of the flashiness, glitter, horns, distortion and bizarre alter-ego we're used to find on a Bowie album; it actually sounds, more than anything else, influenced by Bob Dylan and Paul Simon - and some of the songs here are very specifically Dylan tunes. The album's biggest flaw is that Bowie tries so hard to sound like Dylan, that he makes little to no use of his own terrific and unique voice and showmanship. Though the majority of the songs are quite good, some of the stuff sounds simply like filler, and even the best songs suffer from lack of focus and direction. The whole thing is a rather messy thing, and it hardly stands on its own. If this was Bowie's only album, he would have been remembered as a mediocre one hit wonder with one terrific song.<br />That song, of course, is Space Oddity itself, which was a moderately successful single at the time but got more recognition as Bowie's career blossomed and is now one of his most famous songs. Space Oddity, AKA Ground Control to Major Tom, has the richest sound and most sophisticated arrangement (both instrumental and vocals, David overdubs his voice at least three times) you'll find on this CD, and if you buy it just for this song, the others may disappoint you; but give it a chance. There are some other gems on the album, and though it doesn't have the bright, rich, polished beauty of a golden age Bowie album it has the rough beauty of a good, authentic folk rock record. Unwashed And Somewhat Slightly Dazed and God Knows I'm Good are both great little Dylan-ish tunes, and even if Bowie's lyrics don't match up with that great master's, these songs are good listening. Cygnet Committee is a more sophisticated rock song, and though it may be way too long it has some interesting harmonies and some great bass work (I think that one was probably done by Herbie Flowers). It has the bestlyrics on the album, too. The last song, Memory Of A Free Festival, is very interesting and unusual, in its mood and its arrangement; the mantra-like ending is beautiful, and is a sign for greater things to come from the former David Jones. Finally there's Janine, a wonderful little electric-folk piece which could have fit on almost any classic Bowie album.<br />Two of the songs, though, do much damage to my overall appreciation of this album: Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud is too long, too pretentious and just plain annoying. If you think Life On Mars is too dramatic, check this one out; Bowie's Broadway-like wails on the song are at times quite embarrassing. The other mess-up on Space Oddity is Don't Sit Down. Now, I know it's only forty seconds long, but it really bothers me. This kind of joke could be fun for a mature and proven artist to stick in-between songs, but for an unknown folker to place on his second album is self-indulgent, pretentious and illogical. But hell, I forgive him for that one little mistake.<br />Certainly not one of Bowie's best albums, Space Oddity is still well worth the purchase. If you're a Bowie Fan, it's absolutely essential (like all of his albums right up to Let's Dance).
B000002GVO|5.0|This record is the Eagles' most famous single album, mostly because of the title track.  Many people consider &quot;Hotel California&quot; to be the best rock song ever, and it would have been sufficient to make this a worthwhile album by itself.  There is more, however.  None of the other songs is what I would call a smash hit, but there are several great tunes.  My personal favorite (aside from the title track, of course) is &quot;Wasted Time,&quot; but there are others (Life in the Fast Lane, The Last Resort, Pretty Maids all in a Row) which could be considered hits.<br />The Eagles were and are a great rock band, and their music was a defining force in the 70's.  Any list of the greatest rock albums should include the Eagles' &quot;Hotel California.&quot;
B00008OWZC|3.0|OK, this is Led Zeppelin, so you know it's going to be better than most modern releases, even though it was recorded about 30 years ago.<br />Why didn't I give it 5 stars?<br />1) The live recordings are not brilliant, which is to be expected from a bootleg 30 years ago.<br />2) The concert was recorded halfway through their career, so the set list is not as good as it could have been. That is, there is no Kashmir, Houses of the Holy, Achilles Last Stand, etc.<br />3) Robert Plant is painful at times with his efforts to 'sing' with Page's guitar, thus coming across as a very ordinary singer. I suspect he would have tried much harder if he knew that these concerts would have been worldwide releases 30 years on.<br />Despite these things, I still recommend this to all LZep fans, purely and simply because of the lack of material out there.<br />There are also some great moments that general music fans will appreciate - you could purchase &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; on the strength of 'Stairway to Heaven', 'Rock and Roll', and any number of songs. <br />But I recommend &quot;Remasters&quot;, for new fans, over this CD for the shear weight of great songs. Don't buy 'How the West Was Won' until you are familiar with Led Zeppelin.
B000000OU0|5.0|This is something many classic rock fans dreamed about for many years--the reunion of the Eagles. Then, finally, in 1994, it happened, and the result is this spectacular album(along with the DVD of the same title). The sound is absolutely fantastic, and the band is very impressive, definitely at the top of their game. <br />Most of the classics you and I have heard on the radio for so many years are present here, many performed with a little bit of extra kick that makes you remember why the Eagles were such a rockin' band in the first place. The version of &quot;Hotel California&quot; is breathtaking, &quot;Take it Easy&quot; rocks like no tomorrow, and &quot;Tequila Sunrise&quot; makes you tap your foot in spite of yourself. There are also four new songs (along with one solo song of Don Henley's), all of which are great.<br />I bought the CD when it came out in '94, and am only now experiencing the DVD version. Both are great, and the DVD even has two songs that the CD doesn't. This is an album no Eagles fan should be without, and also one that will be an essential part of any Classic Rocker's collection. The Eagles still have it!
B00005JM03|5.0|2 hours of non stop entertainment. Never slows down and kept me on the edge of my seat through the whole show. Also, some unexpected turns and twists to the plot. I liked it a lot! A must see!
B000002GYR|5.0|Will I stand here and call it brilliant?  Nope.  How about sitting here and calling it a \\"fully realized, emotionally fueled album\\"?  Ooops, nope, sorry, not that either.<br />This album contains one undisputed candidate for Best Song Ever (\\"I Hope that I Don't Fall in Love With You\\"), and a whole bunch of good songs (\\"Ol 55\\" and \\"Martha\\" spring to mind, but that's just me).  Oh, and at least one bad one (\\"Grapefruit Moon\\"...ok, but so much less than something special).<br />Likewise, Waits isn't too sure of himself here.  He gets pushed around by Jerry Yester, the producer.  Not that any of the songs sound bad, mind you.  More that too many of them lack identity, and that Waits seems shoehorned into a folk-jazz stew not of his own making.<br />So why does this get the big 5 stars from me?  Because here's a great example of a man overcoming the limitations placed on him. Waits's raw emotion, empathy, and understanding of his subjects shines through.  He's the rare singer/songwriter who can present a negative character and make us feel for him (or her).  For proof, look no further than \\"I Hope that I don't Fall In love\\" or the rollicking jazz of \\"Ice Cream Man.\\"<br />He developed over the years into the amazing original we know today, but you know something?  This is a pretty good place to start.  A must for all serious Waits fans, and a \\"why don't you have this?\\" for everyone else.
B000002L68|5.0|Like a lot of people, this album was my first &quot;real&quot; taste of the music of the Purple One, and I have loved his music ever since. I won't go over the songs, since they've already been covered in past reviews, but I will say this: I usually will set my CD player to &quot;random&quot; to listen to a CD, but this is one of the few CDs I own that I have to listen to the songs in order. The tracks of Purple Rain tell a story of love, lust, heartbreak, despair, and ultimately, redemption and acceptance. I have seen the movie as well, and it's got that same story, only with some drama and comedy (!!) thrown in for good measure. Basically, if you're a child of the '80s (or even if you can't really remember anything until '85 or '86 'cause you were too young back then) and you like good, heartfelt music, buy this CD and prepare to be blown away.
B00007E8V4|4.0|A 43 minute album with 16 songs (an average of barely more than 2 and 1/2 minutes per song); c'mon! No 5 star CD could be so geared toward listeners with attention deficit disorder. And although this release abounds with alot of the flavor and excitement that made \\"Toxicity\\" one of the great albums of the decade so far, it is quite obviously just the antipasto. It only serves to whet our appetite for the full length CD from SOAD that will be forthcoming (hopefully next year).<br />At the same time, it is still one of the best albums of 2002. I have to praise Rick Rubin for re-mastering and re-recording songs that could have made this release sound like a demo or a bunch of outtakes. There is no doubt that this CD rocks from start to finish but the best cuts end far too quickly. Songs like \\"Innervision\\" and \\"Streamline\\" are made to blow your speakers but just when your head is about to explode, its on to the next track. Take about coitus interruptus! <br />The fact remains that Serj, Daron and co. have now established themselves as members of the upper echelon of hard rock. They can most definitely be mentioned in the same breath as such world class and consistently excellent craftsman as Tool, Deftones and QOTSA. If there next CD lives up to the lofty expectations that \\"..Album\\" has created, SOAD will awarded the title of the one band whose best is yet to come.
B000002JSZ|4.0|Although this is not considered one of AC/DC's better efforts, I consider this album very powerful and worth a look. Released in August of 1983, it has a very raw sound, and it was obvious that they were trying to get on without the help of John \\"MUTT\\" Lange. \\"Rising Power\\" is a good strong opener. \\"This House Is On Fire\\" isn't bad, though it could use some stronger guitar to fit in with the rest of the album. Other catchy tracks include the title track, \\"Bedlam in Belgium,\\" \\"Guns For Hire,\\" and my personal favorite, \\"Landslide.\\" \\"Badlands\\" is a good mid-paced rocker. \\"Nervous Shakedown\\" is ok, but it kind of drags. \\"Deep In The Hole\\" has to be one of the worst songs they ever did. This album has a little filler, but overall, shows AC/DC's power during a time when they were going through many changes. Drummer Phil Rudd was sacked after this album, and he wouldn't return until 1994.<br />Still, this AC/DC's most underrated album of the Johnson era. It has fast, strong tracks with a raw sound that gives you the feeling of what heavy metal is all about. Overall, this album is a must for a hard-rock fan.

B000002G7E|4.0|It's easy to see why this album didn't sell much when released.  It's not that audiences were so unsophisticated at the time (they weren't) and many were amenable to giving experimental music a chance.  Most people didn't know about VU at the time.  The record was released before the heyday of underground FM radio, and, given the nature of their music, they weren't going to get much AM radio play.  But, many who heard this album may have dismissed it as noisy and pretentious [material].  And, that's not a completely unfair criticism!<br />Overall, this is the weakest of the Velvet's four studio albums with the least endearing set of music.  Much of it just doesn't stand the test of time.  White Light/White Heat is great of course but it's very short and there are better versions to be heard.  I Heard Her Call My Name is fun for awhile before it completely disintigrates into a noise fest.  The psycho art rockabilly style of the song makes it sound something like the Legendary Stardust Cowboy might have done had he been a New Yorker instead of a Texan.  One reviewer here likens this release to the album equivalent of Plan 9 from Outer Space.  That's funny.  An appreciation for that type of perspective may be the ticket to really enjoying this record.<br />The true high point of this album is the 17 minute dirge, Sister Ray, and this version is better than other ones I have heard.  ...  The whole song gives the feel of a slow moving train wreck.   It chugs steadily ahead while assaulting the ears of the witnesses in its path.  All the while Lou Reed chants the sleazy lyrics ...  There's a point late in the song when the various bandmembers seem to be trying to outduel each other as purveyors of noise and obnoxiousness but Cale's organ seems to win out in a moment of sheer noisy bliss when you want to grab your skull and scream, \\"NO! NO MORE!\\"<br />Geeze, I think I'll have to throw this one again sometime soon.<br />P.S.  The box set of this disk includes lots of othersongs from the period of this album. Most of them are far more accessible, conventional, and likeable than the music on White Light White Heat.  A true gem from this period, Hey Mr. Rain, is included in that bunch.

B000003TAL|3.0|What is all the fuss about?  Louis Armstrong once said about jazz that if people don't get it, you can't explain it to them.  I guess that describes me and Sonic Youth.<br />I own three Sonic Youth recordings - NY Ghosts and Flowers, Goo, and Dirty.  I borrowed this one from a friend, listened to it, and recorded some of it.  I wouldn't regard any of these as great, not even this so called &quot;masterpiece.&quot;  <br />Teengage Riot is a great intro that gives a very nice alt ambience.  Most of the rest of the album is just noisy and unmemorable.  Yeah, there are times when they sound a little like the noisy parts of White Heat/ White Light Velvet Underground (or maybe at best European Son from the Velvet's debut) but they lack much of the Velvet's ability to draw you into their music.<br />Goo has some amusing moments and Dirty has a few points, too.  I've listed to NY Ghosts and Flowers several times without remembering anything.  Really, I just don't think this band is that accessible.  I haven't found any of the recordings to be a rewarding listen from start to finish and I haven't found much that motivates me to keep listening.
B00008OWZC|5.0|This Three disc set has been a long time coming but it has been worth the wait. This album will set the standard for what a live disc should be. No live recording in history compares. Robert Plant pushes his vocals to almost unrealistic levels, while Jimmy Page pumpes out mind blowing solo after solo, and John Paul Jones keeps the band on track with tiring bass riffs. But the real engine behind this power train is Bonham who cranks out face-melting beats and a nearly 19 minute drum solo in moby dick. Zep's onstage abilities are uncanny and will prabably never be matched. This album shows why Led Zeppelin is the best band to take the stage...Ever!!
B00000GAIW|5.0|Up until \\"Aqualung\\", Jethro Tull was known for their English-folk, blues and jazz-flavored rock music.  While some of that music occasionally bordered on harder rock, typically Jethro Tull's music was relatively light and mellow.  \\"Aqualung\\" caused Jethro Tull to be reclassified as hard rock in 1971.<br />The album opens with the title track.  The opening guitar riffs are immediately recognizable.  As the song progresses, Ian Anderson uses reverberation on his vocals.  The combination of guitars and drums with Ian's vocals placed this song solidly into some of the hardest rock being created at the time.  The lyrics are about an old, homeless man with lecherous thoughts.  The lyrics are very descriptive and poetic, intelligently written and executed.  While the topic could have delved into a moral tale, the lyrics are descriptive rather than lamenting or accusatory or a social policy.<br />\\"Cross-Eyed Mary\\" follows, a story about a lady of the night (or day, apparently).  As in \\"Aqualung\\", to which this song refers, the guitar riffs are driving to a rock beat, along with Ian Anderson's enthusiastic vocals.  Again, the lyrics are descriptive, not judgmental.  In an era when many songs exhorted compassion and care, these lyrics observed and described.<br />After the first two harder sounding songs comes \\"Cheap Day Return\\", a return to the acoustic English folk sound typical of Tull's earlier albums.  This short song is almost an interlude between the previous song and \\"Mother Goose\\".  \\"Mother Goose\\" is surrealistic and poetic, mixing references to fictional characters and plays on names.  The song is largely acoustic and heavily folk influenced, Ian's flute lending a medieval sound to the music.  At one point the vocals also harmonize in a folk-like fashion.  Near the end of the song an electric guitar provides occasional accompaniment to provide a slightly harder edge to this folk-sounding piece.<br />Continuing the mellower music is \\"Wond'ring Aloud\\", with strings and acoustic instruments.  The music is folk; the lyrics are mellow and an enjoyment of life.  Before we think the album is going to stay in the folk vein for the rest of the album, \\"Up to Me\\" returns to the guitar-laden music of the opening songs.  The guitar riffs are recognizable as late 60s/early 70s style, but the Ian Anderson lyrics continue to be obscure and poetic.<br />The next five songs together make up \\"My God\\", a concept within itself that questions religion and the hypocrisy of people that style themselves believers in God.  Including are questions regarding buying of salvation and the role of religion in war and life, and whether people in the church are as pure and holy as religion would have you believe.  Given current events, these lyrics are as relevant today as they were in 1971.<br />\\"My God\\" begins with guitar riffs that may remind you of Black Sabbath.  The song is complex, however, and later the vocals are chants that may be intended to provide an image of monastic chants to the listener.  While the lyrics of \\"Aqualung\\" were observatory and descriptive, these lyrics are accusatory, demanding to know why religion isn't living up to its own ideals.  The remaining songs, \\"Hymn 43\\", \\"Slipstream\\", \\"Locomotive Breath\\" and \\"Wind-Up\\", all have a common theme based on religion.  Given the light lyrics of the late 60s, these songs all question the role and morality of organized religion.<br />This album has two faces, \\"Aqualung\\" and \\"My God\\".  \\"Aqualung\\" is relatively objective observation.  \\"My God\\" questions religion.  Much of the music is rock, and often hard rock.  The lyrics are inspired, occasionally obscure, often poetic, and always intelligently done.  If there was a category in rock called intellectual rock, this album would be in it.  While this album is unlikely to appeal to mainstream rock fans, the music and lyrics at the time were avante garde, keeping in the tradition of Jethro Tull, and thus having substantial progressive rock elements.A must have for fans of cutting edge classic rock music.A must have for fans of cutting edge classic rock music.
B000078DOI|5.0|In short I would have to say that this is one heck of an album. The music is great, and perfectly upbeat. I would especially advise  getting the remastered version for smoother sound, and great bonus tracks (namely the long versions of \\"Knock me down\\", and \\"Sexy mexican maid\\"). Buy it, and enjoy.
B00008G9JO|4.0|I was surprised at the reviews for this CD<br />It's a damm good CD, As a Tull album.<br />I enjoyed it all those years ago and still enjoy it today as a Remastered CD.<br />It's a better album than the reviews are saying.<br />I'm not interested in your disecting of Andersons words or Song Titles, who cares, the songs stand up for themselves.
0684833395|5.0|The funniest book I've ever read in my life..But some not so funny truths are buried under the humor
B00008LDPU|5.0|Animatrix is a welcome twist in the Matrix universe.  Those of us who are the true fans of Matrix world will find this series of episodes to be a creative elaboration on the concept of the Matrix.  It could also be a device used by Warchovski's to keep our hunger to see Matrix Revolutions at bay.<br />While some episodes are free standing, Kid's Story and Final Flight of Osiris are intimately linked to the events of the Matrix: Reloaded.  Those of us who loved the Matrix have to admit; the idea of machines creating an artificial reality is a great one.  Warchowski's were not the first ones to come up with the idea of dream skepticism but their execution of it makes for a fascinating concept.  The idea of the Matrix is filled with mystery, danger, fear, and much of unknown and unexplored.<BR>  <BR>The use of the animation was a great idea to address some of the plot holes of the Matrix series as well as to create more entertainment for those of us who want to see Matrix without Keanu Revees.  What makes Animatrix a good DVD is that it incorporates nine wholly different stories and styles of presentation.  While some will dislike particular episode or episodes most of us will walk away with at least one element or a story as profoundly touching.  In other words, you might not like all, but at least something here.<br />   There are two particular episodes I found especially exciting.  They are Matriculated and Program.  Even though both of these episodes do not seem to appeal to general liking I find them particularly profound.  Matriculated is very abstract piece and unlike some other episodes its message is not spoon feed directly to the audience.  The visual imagery was stunning and memorable and was intended to make us come up with our own interpretations of what seemed bizarre.  Perhaps Matriculated yields a hint at what will happen in Matrix Revolutions, I can't wait.
B000089RVX|1.0|My wife purchased this album on the strength of the single 'Bring me back to Life'. I think I was able to make through 1 and 1/2 listens to this album before giving up.<br />The music is fairly standard fare, with nothing special to offer the rock/metal scene. Bland, but inoffensive.<br />The main gripe I have with the album is with Amy Lee's vocals. They come across as if she is trying to sound depressing and are completely mismatched with the music.<br />If you want something that is going to be of the truly dark and depressed side of life, take a look at Paradise Lost or Anathema.<br />If you are looking for nu metal with a twist, you may enjoy this album, provided you don't mind the fact that the music sounds like all the other nu metal bands out these days.
0393057658|5.0|Any real baseball fan will love this book. I inhaled.  Built around the the translation of statistics to identify talent that is not fully valued by other teams and game strategy, it tells the story of the Oakland 1992 under general manager Billy Beane and lhow he put it together.  A great read.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I couldn't disagree more with the Amazon review.  One listen and I was hooked by Mayer's smooth style and his intelligent lyrics.  Repetition has only made it better.  I consider it the best album I've heard in months and would recommend it to anyone.  You're missing something really special!
B000092ZYY|5.0|This album is extremely good...every song has something to offer.  They are all so unique and Radiohead's sound has always been very original.  I've read a lot of reviews talking about how Radiohead are \\"almost back on track\\"...well that's just stupid what makes you think they are trying to get back to the bends type music.  I think they are fine and it doesn't seem like they went out of they ways to appease the people eager for some bends...they use guitars in just the right places (and techno stuff too).  It seems to me like they did some purely guitar stuff in the beginning, then some really electronic stuff and now haveing tasted both they have combined it into this remarkable album.  I was pretty much expecting that so I liked this cd on the first listen (trust me you will like it eventually no matter how long it takes you).  I was already in the mood for this music anyway I had just bought the new Blur album (another highly recommended cd...especially if you like Radiohead).  I really like all of the tracks but the standouts are 2+2=5, Go To Sleep, We Suck Young Blood, There There, and A Wolf at the Door.  The packaging is also appealing.  The artwork is very nice and the special edition folds out like a roadmap.  Very clever.  This is highly recommended for anyone who appreciates music.  period.  now buy.
B00008MNYS|5.0|I bought Escapology after hearing the single \\"Feel\\" on the radio; hearing it was one of those head-turning moments like hearing U2 for the first time. With a gorgeous, limber voice, a sharp sense of humor, infectious melodies, and unusual depth and vulnerability to his lyrics, Robbie Williams has crafted one of the best CD's of the decade. It is difficult for me to believe that he isn't better-known here in the U.S., although I can understand that his music isn't for everyone; it's an unusual combination of smart, sexy, tender, and raw. After falling in love with Escapology, I bought three of his other CD's; so far, this is my favorite, although the single \\"Angels\\" (from The Ego has Landed, among others)is a beautiful ballad. Escapology has become my favorite after-work workout CD; it's uptempo enough, and sexy and sinuous enough, to quicken the pulse while soothing the savage soul. If you've lived enough to survive a few mistakes, and learn from them, you'll find a kindred spirit in this music. Can't wait to see what the next CD will bring; hope this one does well enough that we'll see a tour of the U.S.!
6304698690|5.0|This 1993 Warner Bros. version of &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; is the best version in my opinion. It's a much more subtle piece of work than the 1949 MGM version with Margaret O'Brien. The child actors in this film are superb, as well as the adult actors. The cinematography and musical score are both beautiful. I've seen three film versions of &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;: MGM's 1949 film, Hallmark's 1987 TV movie, and Warner Brothers' 1993 film. This last one is my favorite of the lot, and one of the most beautiful films ever made.
B00008IXAR|4.0|This album is a joy to listen to, something to listen to while you're sitting on the sofa, feet up with a cup of warm coffee or a glass of irish cream on ice. Smooth and flowing. My favourite tracks in this album are &quot;Home&quot; (has a tinge of melancholy in it, but it perfectly captures the restlessness of being 'home'-less and the need to belong); &quot;You Make Me Feel Brand New&quot; (a perfect Stylistics serenade by a perfect voice!); &quot;It's You&quot; (mellow but yet wonderfully infused with warmth - don't listen to this track alone! *smile*); &quot;Lost Weekend&quot; (groovy with a touch of acid jazz - something to sway your body to!). And after you enjoy Hucknall's great voice, &quot;Home (reprise)&quot; track nicely closes the album with the yearning tunes ...<br />Get this CD, relax and enjoy, it will probably bring a smile on your face as has it done to me. A perfect Winter warmer!<br />Just like a glass of irish cream on the rocks is not enough, you will probably want to put this CD on continuous play!
B00008PX8P|5.0|I only became aware of this DVD about a month before it's release.  I went and bought the one copy that didn't blow out of the store for $.  What a deal for 5+ hours.  First of all, both DVDs have their own liner note booklets.  Reading this makes you appreciate how lucky Jimmy was to acquire and restore much of this material.  The first DVD starts with the complete 1970 Royal Albert Hall show.  I was immediately stunned for several reasons.  You could tell this was the beginning of their superstardom.  Of all the footage I've seen, this is the most intimate as they weren't in the stadium venue yet.  All of the songs are raw and powerful.  The audio mix is incredible.  Who hasn't heard Whole Lotta Love on the radio more than they need to?  However, when you listen to this fresh performance with Plant's old voice, it blows you away.  During the break on that song where Bonham is is doing his thing,  Jimmy is playing with an Echoplex to get all sorts of wierd sounds.  The really cool part is the sounds are panning all around in surround mode.  Incredible.  You also get clear instrumental separation between Jimmy (right Speaker), Robert (center) and Jones (Left).  There are concerts out there from last year that don't take near the advantage of DTS as this one does.  The Earl's Court and Knebworth shows are great as well.  The TV appearances are interesting and really show what they sounded like just before they started to really peak around the Royal Albert show.  The acoustic and electric sets at Earl's Court gave the best live versions of Stairway and Going to California yet.  The Madison Square Garden clips added some goodies no ton TSRTS.  The Knebworth Show is the best version of several In Through the Outdoor Tune.  In the Evening and Kashmir both sound powerful and full.  <br />For those that were disappointed with The Song Remains the Same,  this makes up for it in spades.
0375703764|3.0|Wow!  I read this book in one long session, and believe me, about 3/4 of the way through, you just don't know which way to turn the page to go forward!  It is like reading an Escher painting.  Stories within stories. . . symbols that turn out to be reality and reality that turns out to be symbols -- yikes!  Don't read this unless you can handle a trip at least 5 and 1/2 minutes into your own psyche.  Madness abounds.  This is a haunted house story like none other (though the aftertaste is rather like \\"House on the Borderland\\").  And I thought my heart would break for Johnny Truant.  I will not give any of the story away (you have to read it yourself! No helpful hints!).  But this is definitely worth the trouble the book initially presents.
B00005JKCH|3.0|To tell the truth, I really expected a lot more out of this movie. When I first saw it, I liked it, but after I thought about it, this movie wasn't as good as people made it out to be. I still look forward to Spider-Man 2, but I hope that it delivers more than this one did.
0553278223|4.0|Mars has always played a big part in science fiction. From Burroughs's macho fantasies to Wells's merciless invaders, from Heinlein's strange land to Robinson's terraforming, Mars has been writ large in our imagination. But the current that runs through all of these works is of a world both coherent and uniform. The planet exists as a whole and is presented to us as a whole.<br />But if we stopped to think about it, how can a planet as immense as Mars be taken as a whole? If we looked deeply, wouldn't Mars present an infinite number of facets to our scrutiny? Wouldn't each facet tell its own unique and peculiar story?<br />This is what Bradbury does in &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;. The title serves as fair warning. This is not a conventional novel, but a set of chronicles: a collection of tidbits written to give us a taste of a place's boundless variety. And what a refreshing approach it is. In this work, Mars is more than just a setting. It becomes a personality; some days happy, some days sad; some days heedless, some days thoughtful.<br />Some of these vignettes succeed better than others. But taken in their entirety, they provide us with a breadth of feeling that would not be possible in a single uniform work.<br />However, if this were all that this work accomplished, it would be no more than an interesting exercise in technique. &quot;Chronicles&quot; really compels us because it touches our souls. Of all the science fiction greats, Bradbury strikes closest to the human heart. No one else can write quite his way; achieving that just-right balance between eccentricity and pathos, ordinary and fantastic; life and circumstance: living and breathing filtered through the orange mist of nostalgia. Nowhere does he strike that balance as well as he does here.<br />Nor should readers be put off by the abrupt changes. The various stories may jump from place to place and character to character, but there is a wealth of strong underlying themes that bind the varioussegments into a coherent whole. How do ordinary people respond to an extraordinary environment? Can intelligence overcome tribal instincts to embrace completely different beings? Can we ever, in the depth of our bones, truly make an alien landscape our home? Is our greatest challenge the conquest of space, or the conquest of human frailty? These are only some of the many worthy themes that run through the various episodes.<br />It's not perfect. I will be the first to admit that some episodes don't quite work. But what it lacks in consistent polish, it makes up for in nerve and originality. Bradbury is not content just to explore human themes. He chances unconventional approaches because the themes he wishes to explore are themselves unconventional. It takes literary guts to take such chances, and when they even half work, the composer deserves respect. In this collection, the general quality is so high, that it demands our appreciation.
B000002H33|5.0|A great album from a great band<BR>Best tracks:<BR>1.Master of Puppetts<BR>2.Battery<BR>3.Sanittarium
B000068FWC|2.0|It's too bad the album that launched them into superstar status was one of their weakest efforts. Tramp deserved to be recognized much earlier than they were. Their three previous albums had already served to define the epitome of their creative achievement. But in Breakfast, they largely abandoned their progressive rock roots to completely embrace pop culture.<br />I'm not trying to be snooty here. I realize that rock music, in all of its forms, is by definition &quot;popular&quot; culture. But, nonetheless, it spans a continuum with art rock at the one end and bubblegum pop at the other. The one seeks to expand understanding, while the other only worships superficiality. When Tramp moved into the mainstream, they lost much of the edge that made them worth listening to.<br />They certainly showed that they had the talent to produce hit tunes. The catchy melodies, hooks and polish of the various tracks produced three certified chart toppers. They were all standard radio fare and made Tramp big on both sides of the ocean. But, to my ear, they were also all forced, literal and unimaginative.<br />I had started listening to them when they were unknowns, producing their first self-titled debut album in 1970. The first two albums were somewhat self-conscious prog rock affairs, but despite the rough edges, one could tell that they had talent. It wasn't until their third album that they made their big breakthrough. Crime of the Century was a landmark prog album that made them a favourite of the college crowd. Their next two albums continued to enhance their reputation. They produced some exceptionally introspective music with often obscure and confusing lyrics. They were sometimes accused of pomposity and bombast, but they were never slick: that is, until Breakfast.<br />This album may be easy on the ears, but it has neither the introspective melancholy nor the soaring ethereal quality that made their earlier work so singular and intriguing. In Breakfast, Tramp trades sincerity for fame, depth for cliché, and the slow patient build-up for the quick fix. It was a Faustian bargain that started them on their slide to oblivion. Shortly afterward, their creativity would go stale, Hodgson would leave the group, and Tramp would become a shadow of their former selves, coasting along on past glory.<br />Had this album been turned out by another group, it would qualify as a worthy effort. But Tramp had soared with the angels; and having shown what heights they could attain, this album is too slick, contrived and lacking in subtlety to be numbered among their best.
B000000WCA|4.0|The spice girls were not as bad as people thought if people would have listened they would have heard great pop.if not for them there would have been no teen pop[which i know some people are saying exactly]but even teen pop is growing into this great blue eyed soul[justin,christina at the forfront].people jugded the spice girls by there cover and truely missed out on 5 talented girls.
B000001F3C|5.0|In addition to the usual assortment of expectations, this album bears two unfair burdens: it came out of what is arguably the most intelligent and consistently creative band in rock history and it must carry the weight of hindsight.<br />When it first came out 20 years ago (yes, it's been that long!) it struck the musical scene like a bolt of incandescent lightning. It wasn't just the anger or the political activism, but the fact that there was actually a level of extraordinary significance to the music. This wasn't just some nihilistic self-indulgent plaint (Prog), or some anarchistic primal scream (Punk). It was four young men filled with righteous anger, but who chose to express that anger intelligently, thoughtfully and even compassionately. This expression was wrapped up in a talent that borders on the transcendent.<br />Let's remember how old the boys were when they created this little gem. A few years out of their teens, still filled with piss and vinegar, with their fists up and ready to set the world back on its ear. Most guys that age can't get beyond indignation over the high cost of their car insurance. These guys tackled sectarian hate, xenophobia, refugees and spirituality.<br />Today, this album may seem somewhat naïve, but that is due to the distortion of hindsight. It's not fair comparing this album to genre defining masterpieces like The Joshua Tree, Achtung Baby and All That You Can't Leave Behind. Those were more mature works simply because they were written with the benefit of more years. Had the band not subsequently produced such definitive works, where would we place this album? Right up there among the greats.<br />The songs on this album have been the staple of classic rock anthologies for years. Listening to them today, I remember what it was like to be young again, half filled with hope, fear and anger at the injustices in the world, and determined to do something about it. It was a heady time in life and we owe the boys an incalculablethanks for giving us an alternative to the values of the Me decade.
0789723107|5.0|What makes this book a fantastic introduction to Web Usability are its:<br />1) Brevity, conciseness<BR>2) Accessibility, lots of illustrations and cartoon-style diagrams and humor<BR>3) It's very common-sense approach.<br />Truly an eye-opener. I own many books on usability, and rank this one as the highest, probably even above Jakob Nielsen's books. If you are having problems in your company or organization to get your web site right, or are having endless discussions and debates on &quot;how it should be&quot;, &quot;what people like&quot; etc.  - then buy a couple of copies and circulate through your organization. It's a highly effective, readable and short &quot;bible&quot; that ANYONE involved with web design/implementation/strategy MUST read.
B00006879E|5.0|I was lucky enough to catch Maroon 5 live this past week as an opening act for Jason Mraz. While I'd only heard a song or two of theirs before the show, the set was awesome! They had the crowd pumped with their amazing blend of funk and rock. While I wasn't the only one at the show being exposed to Maroon 5 for the first time, I also know I'm not the only one that became a fan that night! Definitely check out the album...you won't be disappointed!
0385504209|5.0|I was so hooked into this book I almost literally had to remind myself to breathe!  What a challenge to figure out what is going to happen ahead of time.<br />Please, PLEASE, to all those &quot;lookers&quot;....DO NOT READ THE ENDING FIRST....You'll spoil it!
B0000640S1|5.0|The film centers on John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone), a vietnam vet and Congressional Medal of Honer winner, who has gone from a Green Beret to a drifter upon his return from 'nam. He has recieved the same harsh treatment by people who, if they went to Vietnam with Rambo, would understand the whole thing better, and know what they were talking about. After trying to visit a war buddy, and finding out that he recently died from Agent Orange, he tries to pass through the small town of Hope, Oregon and is given trouble by sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy), who, after Ram,bo tries to re-enter town after Teasle drops him off at the city limits, arrests him for vagrancy. Leaving Rambo to the deputies, one of them who takes delight in abusing him, he is beaten, sprayed with a fire hose, and nearly shaved - dry, which would really hurt, by the way. These incidents trigger his 'nam memories, and he escapes, heading for the woods. Teasle takes a posse into the woods in pursuit, and they all end up injured, with one dead due to his own stupidity and no fault of Rambo's. After the battle has been on for a while, the government sends Sam Trautman (Richard Crenna), the colonel who trained Rambo and his unit, to try and get Rambo to surrender. When he won't give up, he tells Teasle that he needs one thing when he deals with Rambo: \\"a good supply of body bags\\".<br />This special edition DVD from Artisan has a lot of goodies, plus great sound and video. The extras start with a commentary by the novel's writer David Morrell, who, among other things, tells the differences between the book and the movie (which includes the ending, which I will not spoil here. Plus he did the novelizations of the two sequels, which have the characterization that was needed.). He is a good speaker, and the track is fun to listen to. Next up is a documentary entitled DRAWING FIRST BLOOD: CREATING JOHN RAMBO, where the creators of the movie talk about the adaptation of the novel to the screen. Then the usual production notes, cast and crew information, and trailers. all in all, not a bad package. I also recommend the novel and the soundtrack for the excellent closing credits song and Jerry Goldsmith score. <br />FIRST BLOOD<BR>(1982, R)<BR>John J. Rambo: Sylvester Stallone<BR>Col.

B00008LDPU|5.0|THE ANIMATRIX is a series of nine groundbreaking animated shorts designed as companion pieces to the MATRIX film trilogy, each about 5-10 minutes in length, the longest is about 20 minutes. This is also produced by the Wachowski Bros. and Joel Silver. The range of animation techniques on display here is simply astounding- which easily makes this a 5 star DVD, but THE ANIMATRIX will possibly hold the most appeal to MATRIX fanatics who know the movies inside and out (I'm not one of them so cut me a little slack, mmkay?). What I found most amusing is that the end credits to the films run twice as long as the shorts!<BR>The features are as follows, with my personal faves denoted by an asterisk:<br />1. FINAL FLIGHT OF THE OSIRIS (This was screened in NZ as a short film before DREAMCATCHER, which I haven't seen yet.)<br />2. THE SECOND RENAISSANCE PART 1.<br />3. THE SECOND RENAISSANCE PART 2. (Logically enough).<br />4. KID'S STORY*: Unlike the first three shorts, KID'S STORY actually has a good human interest plot at its core and absolutely brilliant animation. It's about Michael Copper, a geeky high school kid with an obsession with THE MATRIX movies, who finds himself the target of Agents. Best of all, regular schmucks like me can follow it with no problem. Woohoo!<br />5. PROGRAM*: I can't adequately put this one into words, but once you see it you'll understand why. (Yeah, because as I acknowleged in one of my earlier reviews, I'm an uncultured chump.) Anyway, this rocks. Take my word for it. <br />6. WORLD RECORD: In this anecdote, a World Class track sprinter tries to break his own record, but in the tradition of sci-fi wackiness this doesn't go according to plan. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that his coach looks like the World's worst (c)rapper Vanilla Ice. Mercifully, he doesn't start pumping his fist and chanting &quot;Go White Boy Go White Boy Go!&quot;. Whew!<br />7. BEYOND*: A teenage girl searching for her missing cat traces her pet's whereabouts to a haunted house. There's loads of surprises and great visual FX in this short.<br />8. A DETECTIVE STORY*: Excellent black and white detective noir anime in which a Private Eye is hired by agents to capture Trinity. The only catch is the last Detective assigned the same case ended up going stark raving bonkers...<br />9. MATRICULATED*: Final short is the longest at 20 mins, but this one's a real stunner, which is why I won't spoil anything by summarising it.<br />All in all, THE ANIMATRIX is a dazzling showcase for a broad range of talented animators; though personally SPONGEBOB's still #1 in my book. It's just personal taste. Check it out.
6303913903|5.0|I massively enjoyed watching Kyle MacLachlan as a sleazy \\"entertainment director\\" doing both Gina Gershon and Elizabeth Berkley in this flick. The dancing is mediocre but Vegas-flashy, the plot is seedy if predictable, but it sure isn't boring and there's lots of barely-clad dancing girls for the guys, and Kyle naked for the ladies.  Bon apetit!!!
6304806418|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I just saw it tonight and was taken aback by how believable Madonna was and how WONDERFUL Antonio Bandarres was. I do believe Antonio should have recieved something as he was just as important as Madonna. A great movie, and for someone who hates musicals, and is not Madonna's hugest fan..That says something.<BR>I did notice something was pretty funny about the movie. Madonna and Eva Peron were identicle in a lot of ways. Promiscuous, used sex to get to the top, and were powerful figures in their societies.<BR>Kind of makes you laugh at all the controversy huh.
B000000HSU|2.0|Don't get me wrong-this ALBUM is one of the best punk records of all-time. But the CD sounds terrible and is actually inaccurate when compared to the original vinyl release. I'm not a vinyl nazi but in this case the parties concerned really screwed it up. The CD is 5% faster and is pitched up as well when played alonside the vinyl. That means that the songs aren't even in the same key anymore! Why? Why did they ruin this amazing record? The tunes on the original vinyl release were faster than anything before. They sounded insane and that was good. Now HR sounds like a damn chipmunk and the drums have no guts at all. The mix is all screwed up as well. In the mythic \\"someday\\" this will be restored by finding the original 2 track mixes and then re-releasing them on CD. If you can find the vinyl buy it, but if you can't then the CD will have to do. Just know that the CD does not contain the sound that makes this such a classic record. To me, the funny thing is that there is a whole generation loving this CD now that would hate the vinyl 'cause it would sound \\"slow\\".  A better purchase would be the ROIR sessions.
B000021YQV|2.0|Well I do like the music for the most part, it's well thought out in places. However what drives me nuts about this cd is that I don't think the band as a whole can think of more than 5 words per song. I mean come on, I mean come on, I mean come on I mean come on. See, that drove you nuts and so will this cd after a few listens. They constantly say the same thing over and over again. A note to System boys, PLEASE WRITE MORE LYRICS WITH YOUR SONGS!!!!!!!!. The music rocks and the production is very good, just write some more meaningful lyrics please!!<br /><br />2  Stars may be a bit tough I'll admit, but these guys have something here and they should really try and explore it a bit more on the lyrics side of things as it would truly be awesome then. I'm sure they could tweak it a bit without losing the humor that really is System's secret weapon.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|I've read enough about t.A.T.u. to believe that they didn't contribute much to this album other than their voices, but nevertheless, 200 KM/H is a firecracker of an album.<br />The main thing that impresses me about Julia and Lena are their vocal dynamics.  &quot;Not Gonna Get Us&quot; illustrates this about as well as any other track, if not more.  From the soft interludes, to the energetic blitzkrieg of the chorus, these two always manage to deliver a powerful vocal performance despite the volume they may be singing at.  Just one example of how this album keeps you on your toes.  &quot;Not Gonna Get Us&quot; has to be one of my favorite dance tunes of all time, a song packed with more energy than just about any other pop/dance tune I've ever heard!<br />I was a huge fan of the Smiths' &quot;How Soon is Now?&quot; when it was released on radio back in the 80s, and t.A.T.u. does an rather impressive job reprising that cut.  The Smiths' version tended to sound a bit depressing, which was part of its effectiveness, but t.A.T.u. adds a bit more kick to the song, practically making it more appealing than the version Morrissey and the boys came out with.<br />Admittedly, their songwriting ability needs improvement, considering they didn't write the songs for 200 KM/H.  Nevertheless, you can feel the mood of the lyrics they are singing: at peace with who they are, yet defiant of anyone who tries to tell them what to do with their lives.  Sounds like a difficult thing to pull off vocally, but t.A.T.u. manages to do it rather well.  Not bad for a couple of teenagers!
B000002IM7|5.0|This was the 3rd King's X CD I bought (bought \\"Faith Hope Love\\" and \\"Gretchen\\" before this one).  By the time I bought it, it was a few years old, but it stood up well against time.  \\"Goldilox\\" is one of my all-time favorite King's X songs.  I also love the message of \\"Wonder\\".  \\"King is Coming\\" is another of my all-time favorites; as is \\"Far, Far Away\\" and \\"Shot of Love\\".  The last tune \\"Visions\\" is very good as well with its near-screaming vocals and interesting lyrics.  It didn't take me long to see why critics all over the country were praising this release.
B000092ZYX|5.0|another great album by radiohead. it ranks up there with ok computer and kid a. it amazes me when a band can write one song that can really get inside of you and radiohead is one of the few that has a library of music like that.
B000000P17|3.0|The problem here is  their covering other musician songs and not really putting the GNR gritty edge to it. Basically Slash goes through the motions without any attempt  to put his own spin on each song and the result is that the songs  sound  almost similar to the original versions with the exception of Axels screaching vocals. The best song on here in my opinon is Hair of the Dog which is a highly energized  but, once again I only hear Axels presence and not Slashes signarture riffs or the whole GNR vibe from the rest of the band. Axel may as well have sung this stuff on his own as a goof.
B00006BTCA|4.0|ive heard people say they try to be like joy division, but the only thing i see similar are the singers voices, sort of. joy division is nothing like these guys, JD is more of 4-note bass riff with depressing lyrics. dont get me wrong, im a big joy division fan, but interpol is just as good. interpol's music is more, how should i say this, &quot;outer-spacey&quot;. if you were floating through clouds these songs would be playing in your head. or if you had been living in a dark cave for some reason for days, and then finally came out and saw the light again, these songs would be playing through your head. those are probly bad examples of explaining their music, but what im trying to say is that it is good. and if you dont think &quot;PDA&quot; is a good song then there is something wrong with you.
6305508550|5.0|This movie hits all the marks for those in technology jobs and/or cubicle farms!  This is possibly my all-time favorite movie.  I've been watching it for years, and have probably seen it 50 times at least. From Michael Bolton to money laundering; from &quot;flair&quot; to the &quot;jump to conclusions&quot; mat; from the dream of doing nothing to &quot;...it's good to be a gansta!&quot;;from the red Swingline to &quot;...Nina speaking...._just_ a moment!&quot; - this movie is hilarious!  When I have a bad day, I watch this movie.  It is truly therapeutic.
B00008OWZC|5.0|In preparing material for the recently released Led Zeppelin DVD, Jimmy Page apparently came across this previously unreleased live \\"bootleg\\" material.  Songs were taken from two performances in Los Angeles and Long Beach, CA in the summer of 1972.  This three CD set was mixed so that is mirrors a complete concert set.  An \\"official\\" live album has long been missing from the Zep catalog.  Until now we had to make do with The Song Remains the Same soundtrack recording.  This tour takes place sometime after the release of the fourth album and prior to Houses of the Holy.  In typical Zeppelin style, the interpretation of the songs varies from the album renditions.  As such on disc 1 we are treated to fantastic versions of \\"Immigrant Song\\", \\"Black Dog\\", \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\", and of course \\"Stairway to Heaven\\".  Disc's 2 & 3 feature marathon versions of \\"Dazed and Confused\\", \\"Moby Dick\\", and \\"Whole Lotta Love\\".  Moby Dick includes the trademark era drum solo by the great John Bonham.  Just owning these live recordings is reason enough to purchase this disc, but in addition, the sound quality is very good considering the age of the originals.  It's evident that a lot of effort went into cleaning up these recordings and perfecting the sound.  It's been a good year for getting great classic recordings.  First the SACD version of Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and now this \\"must have\\".  I can recommend this CD set without reservations.

0385504209|5.0|Seeing that this work of fiction is just that a work of fiction, it is an extremely enjoyable read.  Definitely a page turner from start to finish and was able to finish it in a few sittings. I recommend the book to people who are looking for a fun, fast-paced summer read, not to those looking for the answers to life's major questions and Christianity's role in those questions. Sit back on the lawn chair and enjoy!
B000066NW0|3.0|Is she punk? Is she a poser? People who are more concerned with what social label Avril Lavigne fits than what her music sounds like give me a head ache. I admit, when I first saw the video for \\"Complicated,\\" I thought, \\"Oh no, an artist whose 'punk' image is at the forefront of pop music.\\" But that's all. I never concentrated on it too much. Who wastes time worrying about a singer being punk or not? Later on in 2002, seeing so much hate, and equally as much adoration, expressed towards her on internet message boards and the like, I decided to burn her album, just to see what the hype was about.<br />Lavigne's vocals are strong and powerful, sometimes even pretty, on the opening track \\"Losing Grip.\\" The second track, the hit \\"Complicated,\\" is possibly one of the catchiest songs ever, with a great sing-along chrous. These, along with \\"Unwanted\\" (a song in the same vein of \\"Losing Grip\\") and \\"Too Much to Ask\\" are the best tracks. \\"Sk8er Boi\\" is an awful attempt at the punk rock thing, sounding over-produced and full of juvenile, high school problem lyrics. However, the worst track on this album is \\"Nobody's Fool.\\" Lavigne attempts to rap, but ends up sounding like she's about ten years old. The softer song \\"I'm With You\\" has rather nice vocals and beautiful cello, but at times, bland lyrics and melody. Overall, Avril Lavigne's first album is quite average, with solid pop would-be hits, bad filler tracks, and middle of the road songs that could have been far better.
B00005JLXE|4.0|From the start it was clear that Daredevil was not expected to be as well received as X-Men or Spider-Man (the delayed release in February was the first clue).  And many people went to see the movie with high expectations because of the amazing job done with the Spider-Man movie and seemed disappointed by this darker tale of vengence and justice.  And while the performance of Ben Affleck does somewhat leave something to be desired, the end product (thanks to the vision and passion of director Mark Steven Johnson) is well worth watching.  Like X-Men before it, Daredevil is partially hamstrung by setting up the characters for the audience, leaving less screen time for the antagonists (and in particular Colin Farrell who does a dead-on Bullseye).  But the back story is important to set the stage for the true lesson being learned by our protagonist; namely, the difference between vigilante and hero lies in the difference between vengence and justice.  And what better character to learn this through than a lawyer, tasked with placing justice above all, even at the expence of vengence.  Yes, the movie has its flaws and slip-ups, but the characters are true to their comic book roots, the character interactions are handled well, the romance played with the proper amount of tragedy, our hero learns his lesson (and truly rises to the ranks of \\"hero\\"), and best of all, at the end of the day, the players are all in position for the next chapter in the drama.  If you missed it in the theaters, I highly recommend seeing this on DVD.
B000089RVX|4.0|When I first heard the song \\"Bring Me To Life,\\" I dismissed Evanescence as Linkin Park + estrogen or a Lacuna Coil rip off. I was way off mark, though. Though singer Amy Lee's vocals bring to mind Tori Amos and Cristina Scabbia (of Lacuna Coil), Lee's voice is all her own. From a deep, almost growl, in the beginning of \\"Going Under,\\" to a softer, mournful crooning in \\"My Immortal,\\" Lee has already reserved a space as one of my favorite rock vocalists. \\"Tourniquet\\" is urgent and at times, angry, with great lyrics. These are my three favorite tracks, but by far not the only highlights. <br />The distorted guitars and male guest vocals in \\"Bring Me To Life\\" do suggest Linkin Park, but that is the only moment in the album that does. \\"Fallen\\" is an astounding release from this Arkansas band that has left me wanting more. Why only four stars? I believe that while an amazing album, Evanescence do have potential to do something even better. Hopefully, in the future, they fulfill this potential.
B00005JLEU|2.0|I saw this DVD at a friends house I had a lot of expectactions about it since it was a Disney merchandised product... well I began to see it and my girlfriend wanted to vomit after the first ten minutes from seen such grotesque creatures in that movie .  The ending was quite bad also since people are turned back to normal but that world stays as evil as in the beginning...well so if you want really good manga better go<br />with the Macross Series...
1878424319|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend when we were discussing an argument I had with another friend.  She told me that I had taken things personally that were not &quot;meant for me&quot;.  At the time I didn't understand what she meant, but after having read &quot;The Four Agreements&quot;, now I do.<BR>Don Miguel Ruiz offers four simple &quot;truths&quot; in this book by which anyone who uses them, and incorporates them into his/her life can find a simpler, more fulfilling way of living and being.  <BR>As other reviewers have said the text is very simple, even basic.  But that is where the beauty is.  The concepts of 1)Be impeccable with your word, 2) don't take anything personally, 3)Don't make assumptions and 4)Always do your best can be applied in anyone's life.  Immediately.  And for me, they resulted in wholesale change in how I see myself, and importantly, how I see other people.  <BR>I highly recommend this book to anyone who would like to make themselves happier, more serene, and more at peace with the people around them.
0385504209|5.0|This book is definitely absorbing.  I read it in two days.  Not only is it a quick read, but it peaked my interest in biblical history such that I've spent the days since finishing the book looking into various areas of history that Brown discusses.  Although this is suffcient to earn five stars from me, it is hard to accept the more general claims that Brown makes in this book.  He provides many interesting vignettes regarding how christianity absorbed various pagan symbols and rituals, but his over-arching claim that Christianity ushered in the modern era of misogyny is simply nonsense.  Just a basic familiarity with Homer reveals that women were treated as chattel thousands of years before Christ or Nicea.  Just about every major ancient ruler was male, and their myths invariably centered on males.  While Christianity/Judaism may have been the first religion without an explicitly female goddess figure, that fact hardly distinguishes a misogynist world from a world of equality.<br />Anyone accepting Mr. Brown's thesis must explain why the modern concept of female equality arose solely in nations with christian histories.  Non-christian cultures have a horrible record regarding their female citizens.  That certain African cultures retain female goddess symbols must be small consolation to the actual flesh and blood women who live there as distinctly second-class citizens.
0316666343|5.0|I am a working mom and have little time for &quot;pleasure&quot; reading.  But once I started this book, I could not put it down.  I found myself sneaking away to get a few extra pages in.  <BR>Alice Sebold's description of how Susie watches her friends, family and schoolmates from heaven mirror exactly what I myself had imagined someone who had passed on might do.  She sees them in the both the dull moments, and the ones that will change their lives forever.<BR>As soon as the book was finished I found wanting to know what happened with Susie, and her family in the years to follow.  It was like getting a taste of &quot;heaven&quot;, and I'd love a full meal!
0140186409|2.0|Let me preface this review by saying that I absolutely LOVE Steinbeck. I would consider him one of my five favorite authors. I think East of Eden is one of my favorite books of all time. I especially like Cannery Row and Tortilla Flat. I even liked The Wayward Bus.<br />HOWEVER, having said that, I must say that I cannot handle The Grapes of Wrath. My tolerance for pain is not nearly high enough. I have to be honest - I've never actually read the entire book. It's much to difficult to read through the tears in my eyes. I am sure that it is, like most of his other novels, a well-written, fascinating account of the lives of some very interesting people. I simply cannot willingly subject myself to such abject despair. I read novels for enjoyment, and I don't enjoy the feeling of having my heart pulled apart piece by piece, page by page.<br />Undoubtedly it is to Steinbeck's great credit that he is able to draw that kind of emotion out of a person through simple words on a page. Only one or two books have ever been able to move me in that way. Unfortunately, it is not a feeling I desire. Perhaps I'm overly sensitive. The book made me want to open up a vein, but apparently millions of people loved it...
B00005JL96|5.0|Everyone's seen the movie by now, I'm sure, so you all know it's the typical touching Disney flick. I really liked the aliens, and I'm sure the animators had fun doing this movie.<BR>The best part of the DVD is the extra scenes shown in penciled animation. Very cool! This alone is worth the price of the DVD.
B000063UR2|5.0|The expanded version of the film addsa lot of little things that make the movie make just a little bit more sense.  Despite the other reviewer's praise for the original score, I wasn't all that impressed.  It just sounded... unpolished.  As though the composer had rushed it.
6300215717|5.0|When considering a classic movie that has ties to reality, Roman Holiday is a first class ticket.  Perhaps the best part of this film is the scenery.  Set in Rome, the film's stars take us on a tour of the Italian City.  From the Trevi Fountain to the Roman Ruins, this classic love story has it all.  A definite affair to remember.
0385509456|5.0|It's been a long while since I got bitten by a book. My husband brought this home the other day, after reading a review, saying &quot;think you might like this, the narrator is autistic&quot;. I work with young autistic children (aged 2-5). Aside from my clinical ability to absolutely understand Christopher, and see in him what many of the kids I work with may be like in 10-12 years, the stark beauty of the writing is absolutly gripping. I read this book in 1 day (in between seeing my &quot;kids&quot;)<BR>It paints (art class was often mentioned)a vivid portrait of an individual who inhabits my world, but is constantly bombarded with it sensorily, and develops his own unique coping skills- which are literally brilliant (mathamatically and scientifically). <BR>The novel's strength is its ability to present to the reader commmon situations as looked at from a new and somewhat disconcerting perspective. And if words are not enough, the author gives the reader little illustrations to fully describe the sensory bombardment, or Christopher's translation of it.<BR>The bottom line - its an extremely original and well told story with both humor and angst, and you can make it a light read or get deeper, as you wish.<BR>Enjoy!
B0000636UN|5.0|I don't mean &quot;funky&quot; as funky music but as attitude.  The Kid Rock inspiration paid off with this album.  This has some of the most astonishing tracks I've heard from any artist.  The collaborations from a broad range of genre artists give it that extra flavor that today's rock music needs: soul, truth, energy, TALENT, and many others.  I can go on forever with the list, but I won't.<BR>     &quot;Steve McQueen&quot; shows her true rock edge as she pays homage to 70's rock(best song to listen to on a road trip).  &quot;Soak Up the Sun&quot; gives summer that extra touch(the best rock to listen to at the beach).  Her two collaborations with Stevie Nicks, &quot;C'mon C'mon&quot; and &quot;Diamond Road&quot; blend perfectly with their voices(I'm starting to see a little of Stevie in Sheryl, and that's good).  She goes retro on &quot;You're an Original&quot; magnificantly.  She pours her heart of loneliness on &quot;Weather Channel&quot; and &quot;Safe And Sound&quot;(do NOT listen to either of these songs before a massage as it'll ruin the experience).<BR>     If you're looking for quality rock music, &quot;C'mon C'mon&quot; is the one to listen to.  There is not a disappointing second in this album, and I'm sure you'll think the same thing.
B00008NRI9|5.0|This movie is awesome if you want tons of laughs and great one liners. I'm not really a fan of Sandra Bullock but she was good in this movie and Hugh Grant was excellent. Highly recomended
0452282152|5.0|I found this to be a great read, based on quite an interesting premise. From one mysterious painting is weaved this very rich account of family life in 17th century Holland.  Among other things, it's an enchanting story of growth and strength of character through a brief, transitional period in the life of one young woman. I enjoyed this novel so much that, after reading it, I went on a bit of a historical-fiction kick. Downside: few other novels measured up to the enjoyment level I found in this work. If you're looking for a story to transport you to another place and time, this is one to pick up.
B000096I9G|5.0|If you are a fan of the Cure, you simply must own this DVD.  It captures an amazing live performance spanning the entire songlist of three albums (Pornography, Disintegration, and Bloodflowers).  It is extremely well done with amazing sound (almost like being in the audience) and crisp and clear visuals. I was very impressed by the performance of the band.  They performed the songs flawlessly and with amazing energy. This is definitely the next best thing to seeing the Cure live.  I highly recommend this DVD for all Cure fans. Buy it now, you won't be disappointed.
B00005JLRT|1.0|I learned two things from this movie that I found somewhat disturbing:<BR>1.  There are still SUVs in the 24th century.<BR>2.  Picard was bald as a teenager.<br />I love ST:TNG.  It's one of my favorite shows.  The movies, though, have tended to be very hit-or-miss.  Any movie that starts off with Patrick Stuart destroying fragile alien desert ecosystems in a 24th century SUV and ends with the Enterprise ramming itself into another ship is definitely a miss.<br />Our antagonist in this movie, Shinzon, is supposed to be a clone of Picard.  This is proven by showing us, the audience, a picture of a much younger Picard in his Academy cadet uniform.  They are physically identical.  And they are both bald, which I don't understand at all, because this belies what we learned in the ST:TNG episode \\"Rascals\\", where a teenaged Picard has a full head of hair.  <br />In any case, Shinzon looked more like Dr. Evil from \\"Austin Powers\\" dressed in creaky cowhides than a young Patrick Stuart.  (If you listen carefully, Shinzon's leather outfit does in fact make squeaky noises whenever he moves!)<br />The plot was weak, the makeup for the Remans bizarre (aren't they, like the Romulans, supposed to be an offshoot of the Vulcans?  Why would living in the dark do that to their skin??), and the killing off of one of the senior staff members incomprehensible.  <br />The only highlight of this movie is finally watching Riker and Troi tie the knot.  Even that was shaky, though, because you KNOW Lwaxana Troi would SO BE THERE at her daughter's wedding, even if she was going to have a Betazoid ceremony later. And apparently Wesley somehow got an invitation while dressing warmly on other planes of existence, because he was there.<br />Star Trek fans, by all means watch this movie.  You'll probably be sorry you did, but would you really be a Trekkie if you passed it over?
B00008PX8P|5.0|1.  Great, fabulous, and a real treat to finally see these films in a format other than 5th gen. video.<BR>2.  One problem for me: not enough Jonesy.
B00005N5S5|5.0|I bought this DVD because of the special features. It was everything I wish for. The cut scenes are great, the menus are great, the entire movie is great. It sounds wonderful as well. If you are in to Terminator, just buy this movie. You won't be disappointed.
B000000WA4|3.0|ok...i actually really liked this album, but i downgraded the rating because the album is a bit off balance.  it's heavy all throughout...i like songs individually, but i just can't seem to listen to the entire album in one sitting.  i have to mix in other songs.  i would download select songs.  i bought the album because it was eons before the napster/kazaa era.  <br />but a plus to the album is that it comes with cool pics that have a pre-raphaelite/rosetti/lewis-carroll-fall-down-the-rabbit-hole quality.  i particularly remember the experience of listening to \\"tonight tonight\\" while paging through the pictures during a car ride to the countryside.  i don't know - the whole thing seemed to fit.  does anyone remember the music video of \\"tonight tonight\\"?  it was beautiful.
B000002L9Y|5.0|First of all, I love Fleetwood Mac, but I think that this is not one of thier best albums, overall. This is the only album, in which Stevie Nick's songs are not up to par, exvept for the wonderful and mysterious seven wonders (one of stevie's very best). I thought her other two songs however, were pretty forgetable (sorry Stevie!). Stevie may have been showing the wear and tear of having two professtional careers (Fleetwood Mac and her solo career) OF Christine McVies songs, Little lies is a great, group-type song. Everywhere is pretty good and keeps with the mysterious sound that FM is known for. Isn't it midnight is an okay rock song. Big love is a pretty good song, but not good enough to be the first single on this album. Family Man is a cool song with a great beat and outstanding guitar work, This is one of Lyndsey Buckinghams very best songs, but I think the rest of his songs on Tango are pretty forgetable. I think this album deserves 5 stars easily for the group line-up alone. It has some great songs mixed in with too much filler however.
B00008MNYS|3.0|I absolutely love RW. I still don't understand why this man is nowhere to be seen in U.S. television or heard in U.S. radio. But in regards to Escapology, I am honestly a little disappointed. The one thing about \\"Ego Has Landed\\" and \\"Sing When You're Winning\\" is that in each CD I find that most songs are really great. But in my opinion, Escapology only has a few great songs (\\"Feel\\", \\"Sexed Up\\", \\"Something Beautiful\\", \\"Revolution\\", and \\"Nan's Song\\").  \\"Me and My Monkey\\" is really funny, but not his good stuff. I think that the album was produced while he was experiencing an emotional low.  In summary, I don't think that this is Robbie's best work, but I think that some great stuff is coming in the future.
B000002KKC|5.0|Even though some of the songs on this album are somewhat bizarre, you still have to love a band that releases so many non-commercial songs on one album-especially after the mega-successful rumours album. Of Stevie Nicks' songs, I thought that Angel was probably my favorite on this album. This song never really got it's due. Obviously Sara, Tusk and think about me are all great songs. Stevie's &quot;Stroms&quot;, Beautiful Child are very good songs too. Sisters of the moon is a great rocker and is especially great live. Of Christine McVies songs, Over and over, Brown eyes, and never forget are all great songs. Lyndsey Buckinghams songs sound like rockabilly or something. His best are: Save me a place, that's all for everyone, what makes you think you're the one, and walk a thin line. Honey Hi is an interesting &quot;group&quot; song. This cd is highly creative and very unique. I've never heard anything like it before or since. It's very artistic. There does seem to be a dark cloud hanging over this album, But the music is so good that you hardly notice it. This album is further evidence of why Fleetwood Mac is one of the greatest bands in rock history.
B000000WA4|5.0|This album is perfect, a symbol of Billy Corgan's true skillfulness, meticulousness, and talent.  Its hard for some people to look beyond the big hits on the album, i.e. '1979', 'bullet', 'zero, (which, by the way, are all great songs) but one has look at the entire spectrom.  Its sound ranges from the orchestrated 'tonight, tonight' to the heavy metal 'jellybelly'to the soft acoustic performance, 'stumbliene.'  The songs contrast eachother greatly, and some people may not care for that.  However the Pumpkins were a band that was willing to take risks, push the envelope, and continually change its image.  This album was the pinnacle of the Pumpkins' carreer, and is nostolgic of the the mid-90s rock era.  Simply amazing!  It blows my mind!
B00008J4P5|1.0|My goodness, if this could be considered music, then the whole world of music might as well come crashing down.  Besides some melody hooks (that get old fast), the guitar riffs are repetitive and bland.  Meg's drums are amateur and so incredibly simple that anyone playing for the first time could take her place.  Sorry, but for any artistic potential, technical ability must be there and the White Stripes simply don't have it. Every song is the same, not one of them is redeemable.  It's a shame that marketing has made this &quot;band&quot; so recognized while good bands like the Hellacopters are shoved to the background.  This is proof that hype can be created even when good music is not.  Please, for the sake of real musicians out there, don't buy into this hype.
B00005RFAI|5.0|I purchased Pink's CD back in Feb this year only because of &quot;Get the Party Started&quot;.  I had heard the song on MTV and VHI.  A friend of mine encouraged me to get it as she liked &quot;Like a Pill&quot;.  So I did and she was right.  This is a great CD.  I am surprised as I didn't think I'd like her music because I am a conservative person and she is way out there.  I really love the two songs I mentioned as well as &quot;18 Wheeler&quot; and &quot;Lonley Girl&quot; . I am partial to &quot;Misery&quot; and &quot;Family Portrait&quot;.  I have to listen to the others more often to get a feel of those songs.  Anyways, I look forward to Pink's next CD.
B0000029LG|5.0|I beg to differ with the gentleman who decided that Little Susie is sappy.<br />HIStory II presents beautiful music, fantastic choreography, and much room for thought.  <br />\\"Little Susie\\" is a touching song about child abuse.  The words are NOT sappy.  This song is very timely in that children are dying more and more in a \\"civilized\\" society.<br />Furthermore, Mr. Jackson's FANS have dubbed him King of Pop, Rock and Soul.   He didn't do this himself. This is seen in the Kingdom segments, i.e., the fans honoring him.  He is saying this is a kingdom made up of his fans.  This is not strange, as all artists have such a kingdom.<br />HIStory II has a beautiful Greek-style scene with Lisa Marie Presley, which is being used as advertising for her career.<br />\\"Earth Song,\\" in my opinion, might be the reason why some of the media hates Michael. Anti-war and Anti-pollution, it makes a very strong statement about the way we treat our earth and each other.  Surely, some people are irritated by his statements.  The rest of us praise it.<br />There is no racial, anti-Semitism, or vulgar behavior, as some folks like to pretend.  They are reading into the video what is not there. Their creative minds must be working overtime.  <br />We see him performing in different cultures, with the beauty of those cultures shining through.  It is a tribute to the world's civilizations!  And it is awesome....<br />Michael's music has still got it going on!!   Those who don't like it need to go elsewhere.  <br />HIStory II is recommended to those who care about love, beauty, truth and artistic expertise.  It speaks to the intellecutal, the artist, the environmentalist, the pacifist, and those interested in different cultures.<br />I highly recommend that if you have an interest in Michael's music, view his videos for yourself, and make up your own mind.
B00005JKPF|4.0|This movie is excellent up to the extent that the mutant are trying to get the normal humans to understand them. But they could have polished up their mind control tricks, but other than that, overall this movie was extra-ordinary. Enjoy it if you haven't seen it yet.
B000002H33|5.0|If you think metallica since 1994 is the greatest band ever you are strongly wrong. Everything they released before that is what Metallica should be remembered for. My favorite bassist was in Metallica, Cliff Burton and this is the last album he is on,looks like he saved the best for last. <BR>With such tracks as Sanitarium, Battery, and The 2nd if not greatest Metallica song Master Of Puppets. This, Ride The Lightning, and ....And Justice For All are some of the greatest albums ever, with Kirk Hammett's Phenomenal guitar work, Cliff Burton's Heavy Bass lines Lars's Double kick drum head busting work, and James Hetfield's lyrical talents reaching a peak Master Of Puppets is everything metal should be!
B00009TB5G|5.0|The Original Two Towers was awesome and I cen tell taht the Extended Edition will clear up little confusions and issues. I am so excited this edtionis supossed tobe 45 minutes longer and with tons and tons more extra stuff.  I give this five rings <BR>o o o o o (hint,hint)Can 't wait until I have it shipped to me.  This one is greater than the first movie and much, much richer.  I recommend this film to everyone.  You won't be dissapointed.
B00005JLPK|4.0|\\"Frida\\" is a biography of famed Mexican artist Frida Kahlo, whose own triumphs were overshadowed by her tempestuous love affair with muralist Diego Rivera. Throughout her adult life, she also dealt with constant physical pain caused by a near fatal traffic accident. She was one of the most remarkable women of the 20th Century. The film is a visually dazzling work but is brought down a notch by a script which never completely captures her essence. The life of a brilliant artist is admittedly difficult to convey, due to the genius, eccentricity and ego involved, and \\"Frida\\" does manage to come close to achieving its loft goals.<br />Selma Hayek gives a masterful, heartfelt performance as Frida, as does Alfred Molina as Diego. What inspires us, however, is the direction by Julie Taymor, whose colorful and amazing visuals tell us much about how Frida may have viewed the world. Taymor, I feel, is as much an artist as her subject. The script may waver and meander, but Taymor's direction shows that she innately understands who and what Frida was. She almost manages to make the script's flaws seem superfluous. <br />For lovers of art in all its many forms, \\"Frida\\" is a must.
B00005JM1F|5.0|This Movie Is Funny As [...] And Darn Good At Being A Sophmoric Comedy. Mitch Takes The Early Flight Home To Catch His Girlfriend Having An Orgy With 2 Strangers. It Goes To Frank's Wedding And Beanie Is Giving Him The Best Relationship Advive Don't Do It. Well Beanie Was Right Because His Wife Filed For Divorce A Short Time Later.

B000002KD5|5.0|This album was a good example of what Lyndsey Buckingham could do. Early in his career with FM, Buckinghams songs were much more polished than later offerings. Granted, he always had a bit of an edge to him, but his songs on &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; are great. Monday Morning, Blue Letter are outstanding, uptempo songs, easily two of his best FM songs. Christine McVie's offerings are great as well. I never tire of listening to &quot;over my head&quot;. It's such a soothing, smooth, tapestry of music. Warm ways has a similar feel to it and is a beautiful love song. Of course the hit &quot;say you love me&quot; is outstanding. I love Buckinghams solo on that song. Last, but not least, Stevie Nick's signiture song, Riannon is here. But I think her greatest song ever is landslide, which was re-made at least 3 times, to prove my point. Crystal is beautiful as well (written by nick's sung by Buckingham). All in all, I think this ablum is as good as the mega rumours album.
B00005JLR2|3.0|the movie isn't bad, nice drawing, action-packed, but the story is nothing special, just like all other Disney animation, the way the story goes and the personalities of the characters, all the same, the people making these movies are losing ideas now, studio Ghibli is well deserved to beat Disney in this year's Oscar.
B00003CXI1|3.0|Chris Columbus has got to be the worse successfull director in history. His camera is still, his shots boring, his pacing perplexing and his lighting banal. The problem with this movie is him, he is not making a movie, just filming a book. The problem is, you can't film a book you have to adapt it to a visual medium, this is not a visual man working here. Want to understand my POV, then read this book & Fellowship of the Ring, then go watch the two films. Both are faithful adaptations, but one is interesting, one boring. I can't wait for the third film and finally, a new director.<br />The bright spot, the cast. The kids are great, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger is perfect, but if you notice, Daniel Radcliff, Harry, get's very little good dialogue, he's like a supporting player in his own film.<br />As for the DVD. The deleted scenes should be in an extended version, not hidden behind some inane game you have to play to watch them on the second disk. ... How about a real, decent documentry next time? A real extra we don't have to waste precious minutes of our lives looking for.
0316666343|4.0|This is the story of Susie Salmon who is raped and murdered at age 14 and who subsequently looks down at her family from heaven and witnesses the ways that her friends and family cope with her death.  The initial tragedy of Susie's death gives rise to succeeding tragedies which she watches helplessly from heaven.  She cannot stop visiting Earth until there is closure to some of the issues which her family and friends face.  There are universal themes of love and redemption which run throughout the book and this may be what has been so appealing to readers.  There are two things which keep me from liking this book as much as the 5-star reviewers.  The first is that after seeing it atop the Best Seller list for months, I felt that it would be an extraordinary book, but for me it wasn't.  Secondly, the heaven<BR>which Alice Sebold describes is not one that I, as a Christian, can identify with.  In her book, heaven is different things to different people and seems to be centered on the individual's preferences in life rather than a central deity.  There is no God mentioned and no joy from being with the creator and sustainer of life.  Because of this, I had a hard time accepting some of the other premises of the book.  On the upside, it was well-written and Sebold has the ability to create interesting characters.

B000002UA0|5.0|The best art is about transcendence. This CD pulls the borders of reality to lengths unknown unless one experiences the sound of &quot;interstallar overdrive.&quot; Unfortunately, the CD's creator, Syd Barrett, never returned back to earth to make a follow-up. In this sense, don't expect typical Floyd here. May be too much to experience for some people, but it does rock out a bit. Inasmuch, its &quot;psychedelic excesses,&quot; as some critics have labeled it, shouldn't be too overwhelming for those who have yet to arrive at the idealic vision the playback creates.
B00005RYKU|2.0|I thought this film would be like Hand That Rocks The Cradle. Obviously it was just a reason to give LeeLee a starring role. The best actors are the insane couple. LeeLee is stiff and under acts the entire film. The director gets an A for effort, but this film is nothing different. The Glass House is all right for a movie to catch on late-night cable. But I wouldn't spend any money on it. I bought the movie when it first came out on video and have sense tossed it in the trash. Not exciting enough to keep watching. Save your time and energy for Joy Ride if you're a LeeLee Sobieski fan.
6304779356|5.0|Even though this movie takes place in a city called Santa Carla, which is very close to Santa Clara, which is in Southern California, the movie is actually filmed in Santa Cruz.  Santa Clara isn't a beach city.  Santa Cruz is.  I've been to the caves in the movie.  They also have some at UC, Santa Cruz. That is the Santa Cruz boardwalk, and the grandpas house is in Bonny Doon.
B00005BL2A|5.0|This is really a very good cd, although it is a bit sugar coated at times.  I know everyone has their opinion of what's good, but I truly cannot understand anyone's harsh criticism of this release.  Maybe it's the upward shift in the music rather than the dark path they were traversing in previous releases.  Maybe it's the heavy use of synthesizers.  I don't know, but I love this cd.  The songs are quite diverse and the arrangements on most of the songs are beautiful.  With the exception of &quot;I Feel Loved&quot;, the songs aren't exactly dance style but they aren't laid back either.
038572179X|4.0|Atonement consists of 4 sections, with the first section comprising about half the book.  This section is set at an English country house between the world wars, takes place primarily in one day, and is populated with a mother, 3 siblings, a visitor, 3 cousins, and a family protg.  It shifts narrative perspective between the characters, but it is the youngest sibling, a young 13 year old aspiring writer, who is the primary character.  The writing in this section is often beautiful; however, it  has that almost repetitious quality that, while very effective,  made this reader sometimes want to say, \\"enough\\".  This first section begins with the production of a play by the 13 year old, and this entire narrative thread is unnecessarily long.  The rest of the book is written with an economy of style and is quite arresting. The second section  is narrated by an infantryman during the retreat to Dunkirk, and really stands on its own as a an excellent piece of writing, although it fits into the overall schema of the novel.  In fact, one of the outstanding qualities of the novel is how all the sections fit together, so that the whole is so much more than the sum of the parts.
B0000A36J5|5.0|You won't want to pass up this collector's edition.  If you bought the first one you know how cool the Aragonath bookends look!  Here's what you can get with this year's version:<br /> A collectible Gollum polystone statue created by Sideshow Weta. <BR> <BR> Bonus DVD on the Weta Workshop and how the Gollum statue was created, featuring interviews with Peter Jackson.<br /> A printed companion piece showing how Gollum evolved from pencil sketch to sculpted maquette to digital character.<br />The extra DVD makes this set more exclusive thatn FOTR - which included the National Geographic special that could be bought separately.  Fans will not want to pass ths up!<br />Oh yeah, plus there's the movie itself with an added 43 minutes of footage.  We'll get a glimpse of Denethor, father to Boromir and Faramir.  Boromir will also make an appearance in the special edition.  Faramir's anger will make more sense after you see what you missed from the theatrical version.<br />Two Towers is a staggering film.  Helm's Deep might just be the finest battle scene ever filmed.  The visuals are simply stunning.  <br />The film does not follow the book but that's for the better.  The book is very linear and that would not have translated well into a movie experience.  <br />I only wish they could have somehow packaged the theatrical version with the extended edition.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Who would have thought of Buffy & musical in the same sentence? If I hadn't seen the previews for it, I certainly would not have, but they were intriguing & I always watch Buffy so.... It was WONDERFUL!!! One of the best episodes ever with fantastic editing & the surprise that the entire cast can sing & that Giles, Tara & Spike were INCREDIBLE!!! I share my videotape of \\"Once More With Feeling\\" frequently with friends & immediately purchased the CD when I saw it. Buy it if you are a Buffy fan; it is GREAT! Joss... you did it!!! Thanks!
B000056VJ7|1.0|Unbelievably overblown, melodramatic, and pompous in the extreme this album could only have been made and released in the 70's.  As a (laughable) time capsule from that era it actually almost works, but as music it is nothing short of dreadful.  Anyone who finds this stuff interesting needs to get out more.
B000002MUW|4.0|Every Madonna album that comes out, about half the reviews pan it as an embarrasment, while the other half gush \\"it's her best since her debut.\\" The truth is probably always somewhere in the middle. First of all, let's face facts: her natural resources as a singer are a trifle scarce. Madonna herself will admit this in rare moments of modesty. Any given Madonna album is really first and foremost a production foray - a Shep Pettibone joint, or a Dallas Austin, or a William Orbit, or a Mirwais - with The Blond One contributing lyrics and vocals and personality. Her apparent musical diversity is really just the difference between the musicians with whom she collaborates. She surrounds herself with the hottest up-and-comers in whatever genre has her fancy at the moment, and fits herself to the mold as best she can. <br />\\"Bedtime Stories\\" is her most decidedly hip-hop album, seemingly inspired by the harder cuts on \\"Erotica\\" and the \\"Justify My Love\\" remixes. It's the \\"Dallas Austin featuring Madonna\\" album. And in my opinion, it really is her best since her 1983 debut. I like the hip-hop Madonna. Not as cotton-candy mall-rat inane as \\"True Blue;\\" not as day-spa-Qabalah pretentious as \\"Ray of Light;\\" not as sexually cheesy yet lyrically flaccid as \\"Erotica;\\" but classy and well-arranged with an edge. \\"Secret,\\" although the lyrics make no sense, is the quintessential Madonna cut, with its descending bass line, soaring strings, and hard beats, and of course the accompanying video in which the glittering bleached-out overly-made-up nose-ring-wearing Marilyn doppleganger slums it up in a nightclub in Harlem. If only she hadn't graduated from this to the redundant New-Agey electronica in which she presently finds herself mired. \\"Human Nature\\" is, from a production standpoint, one of my favorite joints of all time, and philosophically an example of Madonna at her \\"I regret nothing\\" best, before having children made her vulnerable and self-effacing. \\"I'd Rather be Your Lover\\"is another stand-out for its beats if you can get past the weird gender-bending-for-gender-bending's-sake lyrics.  \\"Forbidden Love\\" is lush and Sade-esque, although one has to wonder what could possibly be so \\"forbidden\\" about it at this point. The rest of the cuts are secondary in my opinion. I was never a big fan of Madonna ballads, if only because she is just not that hot of a singer. It can be almost painful to watch her sing \\"Take a Bow\\" live, but the deftly-mixed studio version is here if you want it. Also the Title track, a strange Bjork composition that is really neither here nor there and indeed totally flopped on the charts. But these are wanderings from the overall hip-hop flavor of the album that to me represents Madonna at her best.

076790592X|5.0|I am usually the none-reader, but the second i opened this book i was completely charmed. It tells the story of a ma's very tough disease, and how it brought out this man's best of times. it is increadible to believe how this spectacular man views life. More spectacular, how he wishes to share it through a young workaholic that gets caught up in remorse and old promises to his long-lost college professor, telling the beautiful story of this man's life, and exposing a miraculous view that changed my perspective of life.
0783225849|5.0|There has been plenty written about PYSCHO;  we all know it deserves it's placement on the pedestal of filmaking-as-art form. Instead of writing more about the film itself, allow me to  rave about the excellence of this DVD. First, you get a beautiful widescreen presentation of the movie (which I had never seen until I got this DVD). The picture is sharp and clear and the sound does justice to those Bernard Herrmann conducted strings. Then there are the extras and what an extras feast! There is a 90 minutes documentary on the making of the film with interviews with Pat Hitchcock, Janet Leigh, Joseph Stefano and others who were there when the film was made.There is an original theatrical trailer which is has Hitch himself selling his film. There is the famous shower scene with the music and without the music which was interesting to compare. There is an extended newsreel footage showing the opening and promotion of the film with scenes of people lining up to see the movie. And there are lots of publicity photos and behind the scence photos. The booklet included contains an essay written by Pat Hitchcock about her father and her experience making this movie. This DVD is a MUST HAVE for any fan of Hitchcock.
B000069HK2|5.0|All I can say is wow this is my all time favorite cd. The day I heard A Box Full of Sharp Objects, I went out and brought the cd. When I listen to the cd I don't even skip around because all of the songs are awesome. Then I saw them in concert they were even better, it was just crazy. My favorite song on this cd is Buried Myself Alive. The secret track at the end is hilarious. Eventhough Bert McCracken screams when he sings you can at least understand what he is saying and the lyrics are great. Buy this cd, you'll get addicted to the sound.
006441034X|5.0|As you read this book a story of humour, mystery, exitement and a pinch of romance unfolds itself. If you read it again -which undoubtedly you will!- you will discover even more about this story and its wonderful characters. The story begins in a hat shop in Market Chipping with Sophie Hatter. Sophie is the eldest child of three children. One day, when she is alone -her two sisters having found apprenticeships- the Witch of the Waste comes and casts a spell on her. She then decides to go to  Wizard Howl, who eats hearts of young girls, in his moving castle...And the wonderful adventure of Sophie Hatter begins.
B00003CXIP|5.0|Maybe it's because I'm a sucker for nostalgia, but I really love this movie. It was made a mere 4 years after I was born, and is set in a time period several decades BEFORE I was born, but it's evocations of American pre-pubesecenthood are timeless. The best feature of the film is the relationship between Chris (a stunningly and subtly talented River Phoenix) and Gordie (Wil Wheaton), especially their last scene together. ...
B00005MP58|5.0|This is my favorite novel ever so I was hesitant to watch a film version of it.  It was given to me as a gift and I sat down really late one night to watch just a few minutes of it before going to bed.  I was hooked!  I could hardly do anything else until I had watched the entire program!  There is not much for me to say that is not mentioned in other reviews.  I believe the casting was perfect, the locations beautiful and all period details were incredibly accurate.  I highly recommend it to anyone discovering Jane Austen for the first time as well as fellow fanatics.
0385504209|5.0|I heard how this book was taking the reading world by storm, so I knew it had to put it at the top of my summer reading list.  I had also just finished a European History survey class during the school year, so the fact that this book was based on historical European facts also sparked my interest.<br />  After I started the book, I simply could not put it down!  Not only that, but I would find myself talking about it to my friends and family.  Either some have heard of it before, and are going to read it based on my reccomendation, or have already read it, and interesting conversations ensued.<br />  Whenever Langston would go on one of his historical tangents (which, by the way, were always interesting and thematically significant, not simply a bragging showing of knowledge) I was always able to corroborate facts in the book with what I learned in my history courses, and personally expanded on these facts, which made the book even more enjoyable.  However, no enjoyment would be taken away by going into the story with little or no knowledge of history.
B000002KKK|3.0|This album from ZZ Top is one of their finer recordings. Although the tone is mellow, the band's playing was extremely professional and a lot of the songs were very strong.    Deguello tends to be a more blues than a rock album, with tracks like 'A Fool for your Stockings' and 'I thank you' sounding like classic blues. Other highlights include 'I'm bad, I'm nationwide', which is more rocking but the guitar is slightly bluegrass, and very inspired. Also an excellent cut is 'Cheap Sunglasses', probably the best song on here, it's slightly sleuth sounding, very accomplished and catchy. The guitar-work on these tracks is excellent.     I'm also partial to the 50's rock 'n' roll style of 'She likes my automobile' and Dusty Hill tearing through 'Hi Fi Mama' just like Little Richard would have. The other tracks share that same understated tone and professional delivery.    I don't think Deguello is perfect, some songs are obviously better than others, but it ultimately amounts to one of ZZ Tops' best records.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I'll tell you what I like so you don't waste your time reading this review if you're not into my tastes. Velvet Underground, Beck, The Hives, Pixies, Iggy Pop, The Clash, The Sex Pistols, The White Stripes, Nirvana, Daft Punk, etc. <BR>The Strokes are excellent and this album is a jewel. I will remember it as one of the best LPs I've heard. All the songs are excellent. Their harmonies are pure. I wonder how they came up with melodies that are so appealing to me. The singer does sound like Lou Reed some times. But you shouldn't get mad at this. You're a fool if you think that new things can still be invented from scratch.
0385504209|4.0|First, let me say that for the last four days I couldn't wait to get back to The Da Vinci Code and I stayed up much too late the last night to savor the final pages of fun. Sadly however, it wasn't the quality of writing that kept me turning the pages.<br />There were plenty of art history, religious, symbolic and cultural tidbits woven into the plot - actually they were the plot - to make this a fascinating, fun read. About halfway into the book I began to wonder if they were really factual but by that time I didn't really care. My recollection of such things as the layout at the Louvre, my close inspection of a reproduction of the Last Supper to see the references for myself and believable descriptions of historical facts and symbols provided enough realism to satisfy me. Afterall, it's just a novel.<br />I just kept thinking of what a better book this could have been if there hadn't been so many trite passages. The characters' italicized ruminations to drive home certain plot points got really old, very quickly. The story didn't need the manufactured cliff-hangers at the end of each chapter, especially when many of the chapters were only 2-3 pages long.<br />Despite those faults, I recommend this book for a welcome diversion from our real world.
B00009L1TA|5.0|this movie is basically (ha get it basically-basic)about an investigation on a missing sergeant who disappeared in a routine training op in a hurricane on one of the Panama Islands.  There are so many twists and turns to this great story you will go away from it with your brain aching saying....\\"wow\\" i highly suggest renting or buying this DVD.
B00005JKN9|1.0|I was expecting more interesting NY stories than this one, especially from Scorsese.<br />The title is \\"Gangs of New York,\\" but you only learn about 2 gangs, one with DiCaprio's character and the other with the Day Lewis'. They showed tiny clips of other gangs, that looked a great deal more interesting but they focused on the same two, dull ones throughout.<br />Too long..........YAWN!
B00004X0Q0|5.0|Yes they broke up, But hey who cares right? Their music is still here and it is still alive and kicking. You don't have to be a hard core hard rock fan kind of person to feel the emotion, the beauty of the words that Cedric sings. I love this band to death and recommend everyone get this album. At the Drive- In will always be number one!
B00005JM93|5.0|Finally!!! a REAL FILM!!!!!!!!.....<br />I'm so tired of wasting 2 hours of my life seeing worhtless, so-called films that I can't believe anyone would fund (usually millions of dollars for) such nonsense.<br />In this film you will see the true meaning of the human condition.<br />The style of the film is pure brilliance. The acting is thrilling ...its sheer perfection.<br />Warning: the first scene, is horrifying, (with shockingly, explicit violence) but continue watching, it is well worth the ride.<br />Don't just see it..buy it! Its a must have!
B00009V7PJ|4.0|This anticipated DVD is a must have! Cher at her very best, puts on a show that is out of this world!<br />Cher with amazing outfits, and a variety of wigs made this concert possible for Emmy Nominations. <br />This DVD is a must have because, it the last tour for the 57 year old singer/actress. Pre-order it today!
B000002KGT|5.0|A classic.  One of the best albums ever.  Nothing more to say.  Perfection.
B00008S2VG|5.0|For anyone who doesn't think that this is a strong piece of work, you probably like to watch American Idol and vote more than just once a show.  Madonna has always been a strong artist pushing the limit.  This work is introspective and very cutting edge.  I've been a fan of Madonna's from the first cd through this one, and though there have been some songs that I still skip past, I've never not loved everything that she has done.  For someone to lay out for the world what they are feeling underneath it all, you have to give it up, Madonna has Balls.
B00005LANG|5.0|The prophet's music and words simply wash over you.  You feel Jah's love all over with every song on this album.  If you do not own this, I feel sorry for you.  If you find that you don't enjoy this album, you made need professional help to remove the pudding from your brain.
0783225857|5.0|I suppose the death of Gregory Peck has left a great moment of sadness within us all. At least those of us lucky enough to have experienced the budding greatness of the 1962 film \\"To Kill A Mockingbird.\\" There was a time, believe it or not, when director Robert Mulligan's \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" was considered trite and conventional. <br />Many critics claimed Gregory Peck's Academy Award-winning honor for this film to be an acknowledgement of a long and fruitful career, rather than the individual performance. Unfortunately, this film was released during a time in American history when cultural change was on the horizon. The messages in this film, based on Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, were no longer considered relevant. They were lost in a sea of grainy TV footage showing Kennedy's assassination, the Vietnam war and Jimi Hendrix performing \\"The Star Spangled Banner.\\"<br />So I suppose it's not a surprise that \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" fell through the cracks. What a joy to see this film's reputation grow on an annual basis. Is there a single American film in history more deserving of lofty status than \\"To Kill A Mockingbird?\\" I say completely, without a moment's hestitation, that Gregory Peck's performance as Atticus Finch is one of the greatest single performances in cinema history. It ranks with George C. Scott's performance in \\"Patton,\\" Robert De Niro's in \\"The Raging Bull\\" and Marlon Brando's in \\"A Streetcar Named Desire.\\"<br />Rarely has a role fit an actor so comfortably and believably as that of Atticus Finch with Gregory Peck. The moment arrived, the cosmos came together, and Peck gave the ultimate performance of a lifetime. It was a role which would forever define a man, if not a country. Today, \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" is required viewing for all children. In fact, it should be required viewing for all Americans. This film ultimately personifies all that is strong and decent within our troubled culture. <br />There are really no villains in \\"ToKill A Mockingbird,\\" but there are deeply flawed men, women and children struggling with the changing tide of a complex society. In \\"To Kill A Mockingbird,\\" this is our world, for better or for worse. Gregory Peck/Atticus Finch will eventually serve as a beacon for us all. His portrayal is a testament. It is an example of what we can truly be if we tap the best within mankind. There is not a single bad note in \\"To Kill A Mockingbird,\\" and a special note must be made for the heartbreaking performance of Brock Peters. <br />I suppose it is telling that when watching this film as a child, I wanted to be like Atticus Finch - wrinkled white suit, gentle smile, respectful of tradition. One day, when my children watch this film, I have not a doubt they will feel the same way. This film, like the book, is exquistely timeless. And to think, it almost fell through the cracks of cultural upheaval.
0142004235|5.0|I read this book back in November (2002) and was quit surprised when Oprah picked this masterpiece as the book that brought her club back... Even without Oprah's backing this is probably one of the GREATEST books I've ever read. You can't put the thing DOWN!<br />In this story, which is loosly based on the book of Genesis insident between two brothers at war(Cain & Able), John Steinbeck gives a brutal examination of almost every nook and kranny of human nature: sex, love, betrayal, hypocrisy, greed, jealuosy, etc... and successfully weaves these elements into a heart wrenching tear-jerking story you'll always remember.<br />This book is one of Steinbeck's most powerful novels since the Grapes of Wrath, and it's realism is POWERFUL enough to invoke a number of EMOTIONS in all of it readers. Buy it. You can't go wrong.
B000053ZRR|5.0|This concert for me (a Bon Jovi fan) was almost perfect. With all the awesome guitair work and action, even for a non-bon jovi fan you will watch over and over again!
0380820846|5.0|Ahh, haven't we all wished for the ability to write witty, yet cutting prose about those we know, love and laugh at the best???<br />Lady Whistledown, who is simply all those things, is so brilliantly exposed during the trials and tribulations of this love affair between Colin and Penelope.  For those of you who are avid Quinn fans from the beginning, you'll love this story for it ties up the mystery of the infamous Lady Whistledown.  AND for those of you who haven't read a Quinn book yet, feel fancy free to pick this book up and start here.  You'll be able to go back and read the previous books with a giggle in your heart that you know something the rest of the players don't.<br />Either way you choose to read it, it's a delightful, funny, entertaining, emotional read and comes highly recommended.
B00005JLWN|5.0|I just saw &quot;Hulk&quot; today and I felt a bit depressed since it didn't live up to my expectations of what a good action movie should be. This movie more than made up for that. This is the best science fiction action movie I've seen in a LONG time. It's incredibly intelligent. Every time I thought I knew what was about to happen there was a twist. This movie is totally unpredictable unlike &quot;The Matrix.&quot; This movie is better than &quot;The Matrix&quot; in every way possible. The fight scenes in this are so brilliantly done. I've never seen gun battles like this. It reminded me of some classic Japanese Animes I've seen. But &quot;Equilibrium stands completely on it's own. It's completely original and I want to watch it again.
B00005JLXE|4.0|I have to say that I am a comic geek. I am also a fan of the Daredevil movie. I haven't seen anything relating to daredevil for awile execpt comics. Well to start off it is about a kid who's eyes get contaminated with radiation and hes blind. I won't ruin the rest for you, but DareDevil isn't as famous as The Incredible Hulk, Spiderman, Superman, or Batman. This is acually a superb example of a not-so-famous superhero makin' it to the big screen. Although the texture rendering was kinda underdone like Star Wars Episode 1. Yeah its not like we can't tell that that effect was cgi. I hope it does well with other people insteat me, my brother, ebert&robert.
B00008LDPU|1.0|As I sat through these short stories my eyelids got heavier and heavier. The pointless stories had me thinking &quot;Why do I care so much about this?&quot; And the answer was &quot;I don't care.&quot; I love anime. That's why I watched the Animatrix. When anime goes bad it's REALLY bad. The problem many animes have is there's too much complicated chatter that the average person will hear as &quot;blah blah blah.&quot; The dry dialog is enough to put anybody to sleep. The animation is beautiful. So the one star I'm giving it will stand for that. But at one point I felt as if I were watching &quot;Final Fantasy.&quot; The characters and backgrounds look like they have been ripped directly from that movie. But it is clear that they did not have as much time to develop this story as they did on Final Fantasy because the animation is choppy and doesn't flow at all. The lips never match up to the voices and the faces have no emotion at all. All in all this DVD is a waste of time. What is happening is the story of the Matrix is being ruined by all this junk coming out. Toys, video games, TV shows, short stories, and worst of all, one sequel right after the other that only tells the exact same story the first movie told. End it already will you?
B00005JLIU|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, besides &quot;Luv&quot; with Jack Lemmon. <BR>Just the small lines you don't catch the first time become more visible the second, or third, or fourth, or..., the 98th time you've watched it. My roommate and his boyfriend and I would watch it 2 or 3 times a week. &quot;Raspberries!&quot; exclaims Muzzy, while flying with Baron von Richter up to meet Miss Dorothy, Millie, and Jimmy.<BR>When Jimmy did the Tapioca, I couldn't stop singing it for days. It stuck in my head. When Judith yells, &quot;Soy sauce!&quot; that sticks in your head, especially if you eat alot of Hawaiin or Chinese foods.<BR>Jimmy in drag is hilarious. We had to pause the movie until we stopped laughing. <BR>You will love it.
0785813500|5.0|A GREAT BOOK. THE BEST SCARY STORIEZ.<br />A ONE OF THE BEST AUTHORS WHO EVER LIVED.
B000092ZYX|4.0|There is beautiful paranoia to be found here. Be it in the Orwellian opener of &quot;2 + 2 = 5&quot; (stolen from &quot;1984&quot; no less), to the comically poignant &quot;Wolf At The Door,&quot; this is a distillation of all Radiohead into one amazing moment. A long time ago, I made a comment to a friend that if Talking Heads and Steely Dan had collided, they would have been Radiohead. I believe that even more so now, as &quot;Hail To The Thief&quot; draws both &quot;Aja&quot; and &quot;Fear Of Music&quot; to mind. &quot;Aja&quot; in the fact that the arrangements are so willingly articulated and obscure at the same time, &quot;Fear Of Music&quot; in that the horror and bizzarro are explored with equal weight.<br />Granted, Radiohead have been artfully exploring this turf ever since they jumped into &quot;The Bends,&quot; then all but rewrote the modern rock handbook on &quot;OK Computer,&quot; and they had to get that electronic thing out their systems via &quot;Kid A/Amenesia&quot; sets. And despite claims to the contrary, this is not really any of those albums' meeting up with any of the others, but more about the evolution of Radiohead. The sound contains bits and pieces of the band's oeuvre, but little new things appear.<br />For instance, &quot;A Punchup At a Wedding&quot; probably would not have fit on a Radiohead album before. It is jazzy and character driven in a way that the band hasn't presented before. The seething anger from this dysfunctional family's spoiled day probably wouldn't have sat next to &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; or &quot;Idiotque,&quot; but fits in perfect with the likes of the stunning &quot;There There.&quot;<br />If there is one thing that defines this album, it's the sense of hopeless oppression. Phrases like &quot;We can wipe you out anytime,&quot; &quot;it's too late because you were not paying attention,&quot; and &quot;He tells me all the ways he's gonna mess me up&quot; litter &quot;Hail To The Thief.&quot; The barely contained rage that has the merest fractional outlet in &quot;There There&quot; and the tight stutter of &quot;Myxomatosis&quot; (what a brilliant concept, a feline medical disorder as relationship metaphor) all thread into an inability to shed the paranoid and not necessarily delusional (Yorke has been quite outspoken about his opposition to the Iraq conflict) perceptions of helplessness to the machinery.<br />I am hesitant to give &quot;Hail To The Thief&quot; a five star rating, but after over a week of listening and the fresh unraveling of new sounds every listen, that may change. It continues to reward on every new play-through.d rage that has the merest fractional outlet in &quot;There There&quot; and the tight stutter of &quot;Myxomatosis&quot; (what a brilliant concept, a feline medical disorder as relationship metaphor) all thread into an inability to shed the paranoid and not necessarily delusional (Yorke has been quite outspoken about his opposition to the Iraq conflict) perceptions of helplessness to the machinery. <br />I am hesitant to give &quot;Hail To The Thief&quot; a five star rating, but after over a week of listening and the fresh unraveling of new sounds every listen, that may change.

B00008J2DQ|1.0|The thing about bands like Godsmack is that they tend to take themselves too seriously. The industrial, pounding, repetitive riffs here and lead vocalist Sully Erna's one-note, barking delivery is so tiring, I can barely get through one sitting without taking a breather. Even the angriest bands in the world should have more than just one mode and the saddest thing about listening to &quot;Faceless&quot;(appropriate title isn't it?)is that these guys think thier sound is still genuine and cutting edge. So Sad...

0393057658|5.0|I have found myself dissecting a baseball game in a much different way since reading 'Moneyball'.  This book is truely insightfull and interesting.   Not just a analysis of Billy Bean, the Oakland A's genious GM, but also a story of the personal triumphs of several &quot;nobody&quot; baseball players.<br />This book is for you if you are a baseball junkie, a statistical nerd, or if you always root for the underdog.
B0000013G9|5.0|this cd started my love for music and its still a classic because of these girl's amazing ability to relay emotions to the listener.  each adds somthing to the mix and their polar talents balance each other.  T-boz's sultry alto, Chilli's soulful mezzo sorprano, and Left Eye's driven raps.   each track flows seamlessly into the next, forming a palpable whole that conveys a strong vibe. where it all started, any true lover of R+B, or for that matter music in general should own this cd.
B000004286|5.0|That's a beautiful soundtrack!<BR>It's really moving and reminds you of the love and dramatic stuff of the movie. <BR>It can stand perfectly alone, without the film behind it, because it's musically inspired and based on a lot of themes. Some of them change slightly song by song. Don't think of that as a repetitiveness factor. Not at all! The score isn't absolutely repeticious! In fact the tunes are very beautiful and arranged in different ways, sometimes with flutes, other times with bow-instrument and also with bagpipes in the scottish way.<BR>In my opinion there's just one negative aspect. Sometimes music-battle tracks (one or two) are a little bit heavy and musically without any sense. On the other hand I'm calmly sure it's a really little litle price to pay for listening to the other magnificent tracks.<BR>James Horner genius, wich will inspire TITANIC and A BEAUTIFUL MIND, emerges cristally in this excellent score that I definetly suggest everyone to buy!
B000002JQ6|5.0|Without a doubt the best ACDC album.  One of the best rock cd's ever.  Go out and buy this cd if u havent already bought it!!!!!
B00005B36H|5.0|Reading some of the reviews for Lateralus, I was compelled to make a few comments here. 1- Please pay no attention to the person who suggests that you listen to System of a Down and Muddvayne instead of tool. Tool surpases these bands in every aspect.  2- The people who so vehemently dislike Lateralus are probably either angry 12 year olds wearing Slipknot shirts or mosh pit frat boys, both who most likely bought Aenima for the heavy guitars, and could never comprehend the complexity and beauty of that album. Tool is NOT, as the majority believe, a metal band. If anything, they have to be classifed as progressive not only for the prog aspects of their music, but because with every album they have progressed into new musical territory. Sadly, half of Tool's fans listen to them so they can attempt to headbang to the &quot;heavy&quot; guitars found on Aenima. Along with the heavy sound of that album, there are beautifly written lyrics and a musical complexity unparalleled in any band today, save Radiohead or Dredg. Pay no attention to advice from a Slipnkot, system of a down, disturbed, or muddvayne fan- unless you're looking for music to which you can get drunk and run into other meatheads. If you want the opinion of someone with a open mind to all forms of music, take mine. Listen to Lateralus with an open mind. It may take you a few listens to fully appreciate the album- as it took me several run throughs to fall in love with it- but you'll end up loving this classic as well.
B000003TAW|5.0|Every single song on this CD is a great song.  I listen to these songs several times a day.  Every single song is different and addictive.  Only In Dreams, an eight minute song, is probably one of the greatest musical pieces ever written.  Once you get this album, you will need to get Pinkerton, thier second CD.  Thier other albums include the Green alcum and Maladroit.
B00008J4P5|4.0|I never really paid attention to The White Stripes. Why? Well because I never really liked them. Their simple and repetitive chord and drum patterns honestly bored me. And I won't lie; some of the stuff here bores me too, which I why I say the album is far overrated and certainly does not deserve the 5 stars that Rolling Stones gave them. But in any case, there is no denying that there is a lot to like here for any fan of classic rock. <br />The first song I listened to was ironically the best, called &quot;Ball and Biscuit.&quot; It is an amazing 7 minute song that combines blues vocals with impressive guitar writing. I was certainly amazed and actually blown away when I heard this track; I obviously did not expect it. <br />Unfortunately, it went downhill from there and just went straight, with no sign of anything close to the excellence of &quot;Ball and Biscuit&quot;. Now do not get me wrong, I am not bashing the songs here, but I just wished that they could have went all out like they did with Biscuit. The song reminded me of Zeppelin, and that is something they can be proud of. But don't get me wrong, the other stuff here is enjoyable too, with the expected fast pased, simple-chord structed songs, and there is also some other surprises as well. Thankfully, they also took the time to include some solos. <br />I like what I hear from Elephant. We are seeing rock revivals happening all over, and this is just another case. Once I heard &quot;Ball and Biscuit&quot;, I was just so close to thinking that rock is revived. Unfortunately the rest of the album does not stack up to that song, which gives this album a solid 4 stars. A great album indeed, but while it could have been a masterpiece, it simply ended up as a great rock album. Thumbs up.
B00005QY5Y|5.0|The lyrics on this album are soulful and all around wonderful. Will not regret you bought this album
0553103547|5.0|While I was waiting for the lastest installment of The Wheel of Time, I was reading some reviews for Robert Jordan's series here on Amazon and I couldn't help but notice how many people were recommending the series A Song of Ice and Fire by George R. R. Martin.  So I got A GAME OF THRONES.  And was hooked.<br /><br />I probably don't read as much fantasy as the average person writing reviews here, but I would have to say that this is probably the most \\"realistic\\" fantasy series that I've ever come across.  The characters are just so...real.  Yeah, Ned Stark is an extraordinarily good man, but that doesn't mean that he doesn't make mistakes, as Jon's existence proves.  Cersei Lannister is introduced as an antagonist, but is she evil?  She loves her children and their welfare is one of her paramount concerns.  Most of her actions can be traced back to that simple premise, and how does that make her different from a typical mother?  And Martin has no problem killing off important characters at anytime, which leads to a definite air of unpredictability.<br /><br />The plot and the setting is also handled expertly by Martin; its reminiscent of medieval Europe.  The magic is tastefully done.  The best part is that (in this first book at least) its very subtle.  Martin doesn't throw it in your face.  At times the reader may even wonder if magic truly exists in this world, and you get the idea that many of the characters harbor similar thoughts.  In fact at the end of this book, when a very clear showcase of magic is presented, you may wonder if it is \\"really\\" happening or if somehow it may be revealed to be something else entirely.<br /><br />The very best part is that Martin seems to have a clear destination in mind.  While we may not know exactly where he's going, he does.
0061007137|5.0|As usual with Archer's books, I could not put this one down.  His thrillers are always terrribly exciting, but I especially enjoyed this one.  It is a novel about an ordinary person, who through certain circumstances, becomes drawn into international espionage through following up on a letter received as part of his father's will.  I read the entire thing in one day and evening, starting in the morning, and finishing at midnight.  And you won't be able to put it down either ! !
B00006CXXU|5.0|Xtina is one of my favorite artists out right now. Not only does she dance in her videos but she's also hot and can really REALLY sing.  Ditching her previous producers for a more R&B soulful edge was a step in the right direction!  Don't let the hit single \\"Dirrty\\" fool you. There is SOME hip-hop on the album but most of it is jazz, R&B and pop.  I can tell she's had many musical influences.  My overall favorite song is the beautiful \\"Soar\\" where she goes into Mariah Carey territory with that high note.  \\"Loving Me 4 Me\\" is also beautiful and sounds like something Erykah Badu would sing from  her album \\"Baduizm.\\"  My second favorite song is \\"Impossible\\" featuring Alicia Keys, and was also produced by Alicia as well.  The beat to \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" featuring Lil' Kim is addicting and is a great feminist message.  \\"Fighter\\" is a great \\"put him in his place\\" type number which reminds me of 'Surivor\\" by Destiny's Child. h er vocals are excellent.  If you like rock, then you'll love \\"Make Over.\\"  My other favorite song is \\"Cruz\\" which is about taking off an just leaving to a place unknown and not knowing what's in store. Overall, get \\"Stripped.\\"  Xtina can show emotion in her voice like no one else can. The production is beautiful and I can see her getting nominated for several Grammies for this.  She also co-wrote several of the songs on the CD which makes it even more personal, like the beautful \\"I'm Ok\\" or \\"The Voice Within.\\" I give \\"Stripped\\" an A+!
6305841861|5.0|Bruce Campbell rules.<br />If you crave good times, you can't go wrong with Evil Dead 2. It's funny, it's gory, it's violent, it's silly, it's witty, it's clever, it's got snazzy one-liners... oh, it's just Evil Dead 2.<br />Sam Raimi created what is quite possibly the greatest sequel to a horror film since Dawn of the Dead. This is a masterpiece of critical (and hilarious) madness. An orgy of slaughter, sawed-off shotguns, chainsaws, axes, hacked-off limbs, h0rny trees, laughing furniture, decapitated girlfriends, ravenous demons, grizzly decay, green/black/blue blood, demonic possession, blood-flooding, slow descent into insanity and other delightful things.<br />Evil Dead 2 is pure brilliance. And one hell of a DVD.
6305252521|5.0|let me start off by saying that i am a huge jim carrey fan. HUGE!! Have been since Ace Ventura, when i was 6. So, of course, growing up, his comedies have made me laugh, and helped create the person i am today(im now nearly 16)<BR>So, back when i was around 11 and i heard that jim had a new movie coming out, i was beside myself, and rushed to the cinema as soon as it was released. To put it mildly, i was sorely disappointed. What had happened to the Jim that had once made me throw up from laughing so much?<BR>After that, i was put off Jim for a while. Didnt even go see Man on the Moon when it came out (i saw it only recently, and was very impressed, by the way)<BR>Then one day, not long before me, myself and irene came out, the truman show was on tv. I had nothing else to do, so i decided to watch it.<BR>This time round, i was genuinely impressed. No, more then impressed; i watched the movie with my mouth hanging open for most bits. By this time, i was 13, and had learned to appreciate peoples acting skills more and more, and that is probably why i didnt like it the first time around; i was too immature.<BR>So, after watching the movie the 2nd time, i came to a realisation: Jim Carrey is an absolutely amazing actor, very underrated, and WAS ROBBED OF THE OSCAR!!! both times, for truman show AND Man on the Moon. I now dont have much respect for the Academy as i once did.<BR>Anyway, back to the movie. Probably my favourite movie EVER! besides Lord of the Rings..and the Mask. The movie was stunning to look at, and really a one of a kind. Very original. It was like the matrix in a weird sort of way. Had never really been done before, and has now been copied considirably.<BR>The acting was great from all parts. Ed Harris was quite disturbing in the way he thought he was doing Truman a world of good by keeping his locked in his prison.<BR>I also love the way the movie was made, how they quite often showed the image through the cameras from rings, pencil sharpeners etc. ithought that was great.<BR>If i could, i would give this movie 100/5<BR>Absolutely amazing
B000092ZYX|4.0|Radiohead is the only contemporary group I kow of that consistently does whatever they want to do, and so far the results have been pretty good. This time, they continue in the abstract style of their previous &quot;Amnesiac&quot;, as usual concerned not with the songs but the sounds. Radiohead use tones the way other people use melodies - as structural elements. For instance, on &quot;Sit Down Stand Up&quot; enormous tension is built and then released not by a change of pace, or harmony, but by the addition of new instrumental colors. And as usual, Thom Yorke's poetry concerns itself not with the word's meanings but how they sound when sung.<br />As well as sounding like &quot;Amnesiac&quot; in its experimentalism, this record also reminds me of &quot;Kid A&quot; in its studio techniques. However, while the songs on &quot;Kid A&quot; were written in the studio and recorded over a period of more than a year, the new album's material was all composed before the band entered the studio, and the whole thing was recorded in two weeks, one song per day. This gives the songs a very &quot;live&quot; sound, something you'll like if you weren't fond of the almost clinical detachedness of some of &quot;Kid A&quot;s numbers.<br />However, rarely is a record absolutely perfect, and this one is no exception. To me it seems that the album is about 15 minutes too long - maybe the middle needed to be tightened up a bit. But as it stands, there's enough good material on here to warrant the full price - and as an added plus, we are given song lyrics for the first time in six years. Bravo.
6305252521|5.0|you know what really annoys me? when i read reviews about this movie, and people say they dont like it because jim carrey wasnt funny, and that they've lost interest in him after the movie. I feel like grabbing them and shaking them until they get some more sense.<BR>Yes, Jim Carrey may be a comedic actor, but so is Robin Williams, and i didnt hear anyone complaing when Robin took home the oscar for good will hunting! They are both absolutely brilliant actors, in both comedy and drama. Jim Carrey should have got at least a nomination, and deserved to take home the little gold man.<BR>I found this movie to be quite disturbing, as an afterthought. <BR>For a while after seeing it, i became quite paraniod, thinking people were watching me. It didnt help that i had also seen enemy of the state around the same time. Hey, i was only 12 or so, i'm allowed to have an imagination :)<BR>So, basically, what i'm trying to say is, amazing movie. A true masterpiece, could never get tired of watching it
B000089RVX|3.0|This is hardly an original sounding band. The only reason you read a lot of that in these reviews is because they are one of the first goth/rock bands with a female singer to hit the top 40 and get some real air play -- and the only reason for that is Bring Me To Life which is a bit more contemporary. I'd be surprised if any other singles from this album hit the top 40.<br />Other than Bring Me To Life, most of the other songs on the album sound very similar and get boring after a while. I'm not saying it [is bad]... just saying that for a similar sound from more seasoned artists, you can check out Nightwish, Lacuna Coil, and other european bands that have got this genre perfected.<br />Evanescence definitely has some talent and potential, and I am looking forward to their next album (if they make one), but right now they're still not quite in the same league as the other bands I mentioned.
B00000JFV9|5.0|After more than 30 years the music from Superfly still holds up, a tribute to the talent of the great Curtis Mayfield.<BR>Although the days of blaxploitation movies are long gone, you can relive those glory days with this album of soulful tunes.<BR>While you may disagree with the premise of the movie itself, there's no denying that Curtis Mayfield composed one of the best musical scores ever for any movie.
B00008PX8P|5.0|After watching this multi-hour marvel of Zeppelinasia, I'm left filled with not only joy, but a bit of sadness--where are today's rock monsters? Am I a doddering old fart, whining about the Good Old Days, or am I correct in thinking that today's bands, while possesing a modicum of talent, fall as short of the Zeps as my golf game does of Tiger Woods? Anyway...<br />As enjoyable as Zeppelin's \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" is, this is far and away superior; it's bigger, badder, more diverse, and its benefitting from modern technology isn't a bad thing, either, in my opinion. Tons of music, of course, is primarily what the DVD's offer, but we also get a number of fascinating promos and interviews. Picture quality ranges from grainy black and white (technology can't, and shouldn't, fix everything) to warm, crisp color. Sound quality is very good, indeed.<br />Highlights? For me, without a doubt, it has to be from the Earls Court section, the 4 song block of \\"Going to California\\", \\"That's the Way\\", \\"Bron Yr Aur Stomp\\", and \\"In My Time of Dying\\". WOW. One of the greatest musical entities in the history of mankind, at the absolute peak of their powers. I was panting and soaked with sweat by the time this chunk of heaven was finished ringing in my ears. Beautiful and brutal.<br />Can you tell that I like this DVD??? :-) Good.
B00005JL7Q|1.0|This would be the top movie i wasted my money on. I saw no point to the story other than the boy gaining a friend. I think it was a waste of money. I don't dislike many movies but I believe this has made the top of my list. I wouldn't recommend anyone wasting their money on this.

0764113496|4.0|I'm a beginner and a language lover, and when a friend of mine gave me this book as a gift I was thrilled. It lists Russian alphabetical order in the front, which is helpful for newbies like myself, and also has an index in the back where you can look up the English verb. As a beginner, this is very helpful. I have never not been able to find a verb here. However, I would not recommend it for someone who has not studied Russian at all. It does not describe the different forms of the verbs, and it can be a little confusing at first. Also, the ability to read Cyrillic is a must; there is no romanization.
B000092ZYX|2.0|No amount of production can hide mediocre songwriting.  Almost every single one of these songs is melodically, emotionally, and intellectually unsatisfying (save for A Wolf at the Door--an outstanding  song by itself).  The structures of 2+2=5 and Sit Down, Stand Up are identical--start quietly, build up to a frenzied end.  Sail to the Moon is pretty, but feels hollow, and I don't think it would work if not for the thorough production.  There, There sounds like Pearl Jam to me.  Nothing special.  Yorke has really painted himself into a corner, in terms of his lyrics.  It seems all he can write about is perceived end-of-world paranoia.  Come on Yorke, do us a favor and turn off CNN.  More of us than you know have been &quot;paying attention.&quot; As for the rest of the CD, I honestly do not understand why Scatterbrain, A Punch-up at a Wedding, The Gloaming, and Go To Sleep were included. Ultimately this CD continues the downward spiral that began with Amnesiac (a collection of underwritten and under-developed songs that were left over from the stellar Kid A).  Come on, Yorke.  You can do better.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|the dishy hugh grant is always a bonus - he provides 80% of the motivation to me to select a movie. this movie has much else to offer too. funny and touching.
1857993284|5.0|I love this book! i've read this book once before, and i'm reading it for the second time now. and i'm only 13! Sophie's World got me really interested in philosophy, and now i'm reading other books on philosophy. The book may not give a lot of information about each philosopher, but enough so it makes you interested to read more about them. At least that's what I think. It's also not just pure philosophy, There's a story along with it. Though according to some people I know, some of the facts are wrong about the philosophers. But other than that, I think it's a really good book.
B000084T18|5.0|Why are all these little punk and rock fans giving this cd 1 star and bitchin about it? stay in your own weak music genres and stay outa rap.  50 rocked the world with this hot album and its probably in 70% of America's cd player right now. Im listenin to it too.  Look at his sales and then come back and say somethin u little posers.
068484267X|5.0|This is an amazing story told through the eyes of a child. Frank McCourt uses his humor very wisely to portray the struggle of an immigrant Irish family. Children tell the best stories and that is exactly what the author accomplished. A life story told from a young boys point of view. I could not put this book down.
B000084T18|2.0|50 is one of the best examples of a rapper having more hype and credibility than one deserves. He rides with Em and Dre does his beats but I cant give him any credit for that. He took nine bullets but c'mon everybody should know that all the real gangstas are dead, in prison, or still hustlin. REAL GANGSTAS DONT RAP. Alot of reviewers say that this is tight gangsta rap or that 50 is trying to bring gangsta rap back but to tell the truth, this guy needs to work on his lyrical skill. If this album came out in 91-96 it probably would be laughed at because he cant compare with the likes of big and pac or any of the other tight albums of the period. I believe many of the people giving this guy good reviews are either young (not hearing the good rap music from the early to mid nineties) or are so starved by the weakness of todays rap game that anything half decent is the shiz these days.  He talks smack about rappers I hate (certain ones making songs for females and club songs) which I like, but then he turns himself into a hypocrit by releasing In da Club as a first single and 21 questions (a definite female song)as his next. Yes, there are some good songs on this cd (about 5). The rest however are marred by bad lyrics or stupid hooks.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This was the best CD shes come out with. i absolutley love it!
0385504209|4.0|I picked up this book thinking it would be a simplistic and unfulfilling mystery.  I was surprised to find it a clever and very well thought out page-turner.  The first 100 or so pages are a little slow, but after that it is hard to put the book down.  Unlike some books (I'm looking your way Eco), this book doesn't have to pretend about how smart it is.  Is everything in the book true?  Of course not, but the book does suggest a dozen or more areas which readers can divert to if interested.  I think the greatest power a book has is to inspire more reading, and this book does that perfectly.
B00009V7P8|5.0|This album is simply amazing.  It is a find like this that makes some of us continue to buy music by artists we know little about; we are searching for that diamond buried beneath mounds Pop Music.  After the last track on &quot;O&quot; played, the hairs on my arms stood on in end for another five minutes.<BR>I won't tell you what this album is like or that you'll like if you like a certain artist; if you really like real music...You Will like this.
B00005JM03|4.0|After that dreadful remake called (For\\"Get Carter\\"), another Michael Caine film is brought from the vault.  Mr. Caine himself in one interview made it clear that he is very proud of the original film made in 1969, and I am sure he will not be so sad after watching this slickly done remake.<br />The new story itself is loosely connected with the original, so let's stop saying 'remake? not again' and see this one as a well-crafted heist movie.  The premise is surprisingly simple.  One heist in Venice leads to double-crossing, and after one year the betrayed thieves get a chance for revenge in Los Angels.  The film features gripping sequences of stealing a big heavy safe, wild motor-boat ride (that must have scared the people in Venice) and car chase of three Mini-Coopers, which literally steals the show with very useful agility.<br />Actors are all good, but all typecast, so you can tell who is the traitor or who got killed while watching the opening credits.  Two names might attract you such as Mark Wahlberg as Charlie, nominal leader of the group, and Charlize Theron as Stella who decides to break the law for her personal reasons, but it is supporting actors like computer-wizard Seth Green or Jason 'Handson Rob' Statham that really impress you with unexpectedly comical turns.  You also see Edward Norton, Mos Def, Franky G, and ubiquitous Donald Sutherland.  Michael Caine does not appear himself, probably because of his regret of having done it in \\"Carter,\\" but it does not mean that he is all gone from the film.  Try to spot 'him.'    <br />The greatest value of the film lies in F. Gary Gray's skillful handling of the characters, and his proficient staging of actions, especially the ones using three Mini-Coopers.  But why Mini-Coopers, you might ask.  Like the original, these characters have to use them in the crutial scenes, so let's not say this is product placement.  Actually, you may say those cars running like daredevil are the true star of the film.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|&quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; literally means &quot;Red Windmill&quot;. Moulin Rouge is a great movie and I personally think it should have won the Oscar for Best Picture. Moulin Rouge is a picture so unique from every other movie created that its hard to compare them. Nicole Kidman's potrayal of Satine was incredible and tasteful. Ewan MacGreggor as Christian in the fabulous motion picture &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; was inspired. This film has the Bohemian spirit shown in no other movie I've seen. That's what made this movie incredible &amp; unique.
0345440757|5.0|With my oldest daughter I (loosely) followed the BabyWise schedule. I found it to be difficult to follow because my baby's cries all seemed so heart-wrenching and I just wanted to hold her. Now that we have baby #2, I've found this book and it has made parenting a newborn/infant so much easier. Tracy Hogg does an excellent job in this book of helping readers interpret their babies' cries. At first I was skeptical, but as time went on it became very clear that her descriptions & interpretations of the body language and cries were right on.
B000063DFN|5.0|With two highly succesful albums (\\"The number of the Beast\\" and \\"Piece of Mind\\") and a live show of growing intensity and ferocity, Iron Maiden was the best band of this golden period of Heavy Metal. And while Japan and Europe had already hailed them as the new kings of metal, this album was the one that rocketed the band to superstardom in America. But that didn't happen because the music was softer or the lyrics were catchier, it happened because this is AGAIN one of the finest albums of MAIDEN. The opening track is just the beginning of all. \\"Aces High\\" is a perfect opener, with its twisting guitar riffs and drum rythms. Then comes what could easily be the most famous Maiden song: \\"Two minutes to midnight\\". Written by the Smith-Dickinson tandem, everything is first class in here: the killer guitar riff, the driving pace, the smart lyrics, the vocal performance. In a recent poll was voted one of the ten best songs in the history of the band. It's followed by an instrumental called \\"Losfer Words\\" who has an egyptian kind of feel. The next three songs although were overlooked in it's time are great and any other band would had die to have them in their repertoire. But the other two gems on this record are the last ones. \\"Powerslave\\" another classic Dickinson's song, the one that gives the title to the album and also the Tour, is not only about Egyptian pharaons but is suitable for any human being who has ever have some power in his hand. The other gem is an epic 14 minute rendition of the Samuel Taylor Coleridge poem \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\". This is in my opinion the best song that Mr. Harris ever wrote. The challenging rythms, the dueling guitar riffs, the changing moods are all top notch. And the vocal performance of Dickinson is incredible, just listen carefully after the mid slow passage when he sings about the curse of the mariner and the rising attack that crowns the coming of the rain. Brilliant. Timeless. Iron Maiden conquered America and the world fell on its knees praising the metal kings. A monstruous world tour followed it. Hundreds of Thousands of kids all around the world who were growing up found it more interesting than Madonna or Culture Club. Now's your turn. Find why.
B00005B36H|5.0|Okay, it's not Aenima.  Even so, I can't give this album anything less than a 5 star rating.  To give it four would be an insult to the obvious attention to detail the band gave Lateralus.  To repeat Aenima would be like duplicating God, so let's just not go there and focus on the fact that this album delivers everything anticipated.  Tool puts on a display of some of the heaviest and poignant riffs (The Grudge) they've pulled off before.  Never letting up, TOOL puts the vocals on hold as they pull out all the stops on instrumentals, delivering a story without speaking a word on the latter half of the album.  Controversial, descriptive, and packing a one-two knock-out punch, Lateralus is one of the finer albums of all time.  They're not heavy metal; they're not progressive; they're not modern rock. They're TOOL.
B00005B4GU|1.0|Wow! If you want a CD of not-too-good amateur funeral music for your Uncle Fred's wake, then buy this CD now!  NOTE To Bandmembers: Don't give up your day jobs quite yet.<br />There might be one or two half-way decent songs on this CD, but I'm still searching - it's difficult to listen to more than 10 seconds or so of this drivel at a time.<br />If this is the future of rock &amp; roll, then rock &amp; roll surely IS dead.  I just hope they don't play this at the wake............
B00005JLYU|4.0|I just finished watching the Japanese premier release of \\"Charlie's Angels--Full Throttle\\" and have now very mixed feelings about it.  I gave this one 4 stars, but the fact is it is slightly lower than that.  Though not as much as the original movie's fun, it is still fun anyway.  Maybe I expected much actions.  Well, let me explain.<br />Don't think about the story, and that's the rule of the original series in 1970s, and the first picture.  The same thing can be said again.  All I can say is that you will see some conspiracy about two stolen rings, a former Angel Madison (Demi Moore), Dylan's ex-boyfriend who suddenly shows up (not that 'Chad' ... thank Heaven), witness protection program, and many, many costumes.  Anyway, you don't summerize the first one's, let's skip this part.<br />Three Angels -- Cameron Diaz's 'Natalie,' Drew Barrymore's 'Dylan,' and Lucy Liu's \\"Alex' are all back.  They are still fun/danger-loving three secret agents, but actions are less compared with the first movie.  Or I should say, if you expect to see the wire actions they showed surprisingly well on the former occasion, you might be disappointed.  The film gives more stress on comic/sexy aspect of the original, and you notice the increased amount of special effects used here.  Actions themselves are done competently, but about the CGIs, not every part is perfect.  Oh, and as to costumes, especially those of Natalie, I might add that her revealing attires are not changing, so ... you know what I mean.<br />Perhaps most interesting part of \\"Full Throttle\\" is its supporting or guest stars.  Several members from the original film's cast come back again -- Luke Wilson, Matt LeBlanc, and  Crispin Glover as The Thin Man -- but Bosley's role is replaced by 'his brother' Bernie Mac, so you won't see Bill's face except briefly on a photo hanging on the wall.  Many guests are added this time, though, among whom you will see Robert Patrick, Robert Forster, Justin Theroux, John Cleese, and one ofthe real original Angels.  And you see famous twin sisters in a hilarious way. <br />But it is Demi Moore who will astonish you, in a good sense, or a bad sense (you choose it).  First she appears just like the first Bond girl (don't miss the surfing scene).  Then she gets more and more ... campy, perhaps intentionally, I hope.  I almost forgot one important thing.  One big star appears as a cameo who gets killed.  And if you know who he is, and later comes to realize who kills him, this is the biggest in-jokes the film offers.<br />Suppose this film is a comedy, just harmless fun.  Some of you might dislike this one, but the chances are you have already seen the original one, so in that case, especially when you loved its comic side, you won't be disapointed.  But I expected some actions, and I knew that Yuen Cheung-Yan was involved again for the producion (and he is brother of Woo-Ping, famous for his work in \\"Matrix\\").  Impresssive (but often very ridiculous) bike stunts or skateboarding ride are there, but I find they are not enough.  Instead, you see lots of gags, verbal or physical, gross-out or sexual.  And they included many, many references to other famous films, which are certainly funny.  So, when one of the angels appears as cheerleader, you hear the song \\"Mickey\\" (yeah, \\"Bring it On\\")  And when these Angels stake out, welding, yes, you hear Irene Cara song.  Maybe too predictable, but it's just OK.<br />Don't think this sequel is improvement on the first film.  It is like \\"Austin Powers\\"; the first one's sensation and funny is reduced, but the good supporting actors/actresses are still helpful.  More jokes, less actions, but still fun.
0767805712|5.0|A compelling story about a man who defies his destination with ambition. He's forced to hide his identity through the exciting plot, while pursuing his dream. This made me hardly sit back, pray for him not to get caught. Science and human emotions are intelligently presented in contrast thru this riveting film. The ending is very remarkable and emotional when the key charactors decide on their own fates. Very impressive, inspiring, exciting film - the best film I ever seen.
0060930187|5.0|i thought this book was really good because it showed the world through Ester's eyes.  Some poeple say that it is just a depressing book, but they have obivously never been depressed.  I have read this book several times and I will continue to read it.
B000063DFQ|5.0|If the previous album \\"The number of the beast\\" was a an early indication of what was going to follow, then \\"PIECE of MIND\\" completely blew away everything. From the powerful detonation of the opening track (\\"Where eagles dare\\" is based on the novel and film of the same name) through to the epic imagery of its last song, this album is another classic Maiden moment. Two incredible singles (\\"The Flight of Icarus\\" and the incandescent all time favourite riff of \\"The Trooper\\"), a 7 minutes ouvre d'art based on the Frank Herbert classic Sci-Fi novel DUNE (Herbert was contacted at the time but refused permission to the band for using it as a title, that's why the song was called \\"To Tame a Land\\"), the beautiful delicacy of \\"Still Life\\" and the anti-nuclear war manifest of \\"Die with your boots on\\", everything shines on this record. Even \\"Sun and Steel\\" and \\"Quest for fire\\" are good examples of 80's metal. I leave for the end my personal favourite of this incredible sound assault: \\"Revelations\\". This Dickinson's original is one of the finest songs that Bruce have ever written. It's also the first song that he officially wrote for Maiden and sets the pace for a dozen of classics that eventually followed it. \\"Piece of Mind\\" enhanced the Maiden popularity around the world, and although they were arguably the best band the best was yet to come. Don't waste more time, metal doesn't get any better than this.
1401200613|4.0|I actually started collecting the storyline in the single-issue comics from the Batman vs. Superman and since nearly all the backissues for this storyline is near-impossible to get, I bought the TPB for the earlier stories. The art of Jim Lee is stunning, it is easy to see why he ranks as one of the best comic artists of all time. And add Jim's talents with Jeph Loeb's storytelling, you've got a winner. While I really admire Jeph Loeb's works (The Long Halloween, Dark Victory, Superman for all Seasons), the story for Hush falls a tad below my expectations. Sure there is a great plot, a new villain, new developments, but in my opinion the stories seem to drag on a little. The main point being that I guess he was tryiong to provide elbow room for Jim Lee to showcase his take on the world of the Dark Knight. I mean some of the plots that encompass an entire issue could have been done in half the time and space. I guess those who buy the TPB will not feel it as much as those who still have to wait each month for the new upcoming issues, like me, but I guess I am just venting. But other than that complaint the storyline is flawless and a great read. And trust me, get volume two of Hush as well, there are a lot of developments (identities are revealed) :), a lot of old  characters come into play and you finally meet the man behind the enitre Hush storyline. The debate on his identity is a heated one, just check the DC messageboards.
B000066NW0|2.0|Well first of all Avril Lavigne is pop not punk-rock Even if you hate her you got to admit she's got catchy songs and some of them are good But honestly \\"Anything but Ordinary\\" is kinda of dumb saying stuff like \\"Sometimes I get so wierd,I even freak myself out\\" Her CD is great to people who like pop but to the rock-punk people not really \\"Sk8ter Boi\\" is the only song on Let Go close to punk While \\"Unwanted\\" is the most rock you'll probarly hear on this CD As for Avril she is kinda fake.She dresses punk and says am tough and stuff but sings pop but well some people do that and I don't really have a big problem with it.She coulden't play guitar before but all of a sudden she plays better noe as for her voice live She used to suck and really bad but now her voice at live perfomances is better But if your into Britney Spears this is great cd>It's just pop with a few guitars on the back
B00006D295|1.0|First off, I am not adverse to the bizarre, the freakish, the twisted, or the outlandish, or even the gender-indenty-problem-ish. As proof, I offer that I will soon own MEET THE FEEBLES.<br />What can I say about this movie? Maybe a lot of people lost their virginity to it at a drive-in. It's the obly explanation I can offer as to why such a huge cult following is attracted to such a cheap, inane, boring, unamusing piece of garbage that goes by the name THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW.<br />Weird doesn't even begin to describe how far beyond norm this is, but I do not hold that against it, in and of itself.<br />What I do have against this movie is that, quite simply, it isn't interesting or funny. Tim Curry's performance and the parade of oddities, while certainly shocking, are not amusing, entertaining or funny by any fathomable means and do not serve any purpose except to simply be messed up for the sake of being messed up. It takes a perverse genieus to make so many outlandish, bizarre things seem so boring.<br />Imagine the BIG LEBOWSKI, with the dude and Walter replaced by a boy scout and his whiney girlfriend wandering around in a haunted house with freakish things happening, minus the wit, humor, style, and worthiness, and you have some idea of what this film accomplishes on levels of stupidity and pure badness. <br />I offer the musical numbers as an example. \\"I'm a sweet transvestite, from Transsexual, Transylvania.\\" What part of that is supposed to be amusing? Beside the fact that has no wit or subtlety, its also juvenile and immature. If there had been something interesting going on with the transsexual theme, it might be fun, but it's simply THERE, and we're supposed to be amused by it, as if the fact that transsexuality EXISTS is funny in and of itself.<br />I am aware that film has ahuge cult following. I must defend myself from them. I suppose if I liked the film I can imagine what my positive review would be. But I did not like the film a bit.  The viewing experience it offered probably accounts for a great number of those who value this movie for the nostalgia it offers rather than its content, but as for the rest, I just don't know what to say. Maybe I'm missing something. Maybe there is some greater, ingenieus satirical concept buried beneath this freak show of musical numbers and sex \\"jokes\\", but it'll be a cold day in he1l before I ever, under any circumstances, use my valuable time on this planet to search for it.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Apparently some people from different countries say this movie is very inaccurate and suffers from patriotic tunnel vision.  I can only wonder what movie they watched! LOL<br />We just watched this movie and it was spectacular.  It is from the perspective of one group of American men, so don't expect the story to give you a sweeping view of the war, views from other units or any perspective from Russian, German, or French soldiers..  If those countries want movies from those perspectives I suggest they gather together some money and MAKE THEM.<br />Some critics claim the movie doesn't depict Germans as humans with feeling or intelligence.  I guess they missed the whole segment of the film that attempted to do just that.  Another critic claimed that Spiers was a \\"war criminal\\" and missed the entire segment of the movie that made it very clear Spiers didn't kill the German soldiers after giving them cigarettes and it was just a wild rumor.  Another person said it never depicted American soldiers as less than perfect, apparently missing the entire segment about the drunk American shooting his fellow officer and the other soldiers almost beating him to death!  Another said the movie only showed Americans as brave and loyal, apparently missing the entire segment about the soldier that hid without firing his weapon on D-day.  C'mon people, WATCH the movie before making inaccurate criticism.<br />I really enjoyed the review that claimed that Americans are only taught about history having to do with America and know nothing about the rest of the world.  As a writer I can personally attest that other countries are SIMPLY awful about including American facets of life in their literature. My books published in England have any little detail that is American edited away because English children might not \\"relate\\" (God forbid they learn something about America!) I've been exposed to literature from Europe, especially England,  with nary a change in text since I was very young.  So that to me is just a bogus \\"anti-American\\" sentiment rearing its ugly head.<br />The movie is accurate and realistic in so many ways.  Americans fought with bravery and cowardice. But the facts can't be denied--by far the majority of American soldiers that fought in WW2 were of a special breed from a special time.  Those men/boys fought with distinction and valor. They weren't perfect but they were unusually honorable and heroic.  This movie shows much of those aspects and we strongly recommend it.  There was one sex scene that came out of nowhere which was over the top.  Find that scene so you're prepared with the remote if watching it with kids (I suggest over age eleven)..

B000002UAR|5.0|If I were to have the boxed set of all of the albums/C.D.s of only one band, it would be that of the Beatles! This album is one that is a must listen to as with all of the other Beatles albums. George really shines on this one (He's my other favorite Beatle besides John)! His songs, &quot;Taxman&quot;, &quot;Love You To&quot;, and &quot;I Want To Tell You&quot; are classics! Remember: The Beatles are THE BEST group ever to exist and probably of all time! We miss you John and George!
0930289234|5.0|I was too young when the Watchmen first came out and since it was a title about super-heroes whom I had not known anything about I played it safe and stuck with familiar superheroes (Superman, Batman). Eight years later, I am reading the reviews on Amazon, the Watchmen is a hit and is one of the best stories ever written in the comics genre. I buy it, I read it, I love it. The story is about the sordid life of superheroes out of the costume. Alan Moore takes the superheroes from their awe-inspiring heights and crashed them into the earth in order to show the humble, dismal and twisted side of their life and personality that never shows through. I am happy that I waited eight years before I read this because if I had read it earlier I wouldn't have enjoyed it or understood it. The stories are very complex and unlike any other super-hero stories. It is difficult to tell whether these are actually heroes are not, one of them is a sociopath (Rorschach, my favorite), another a<br />being of almost cosmic capacity (Dr. Manhattan), etc. Sure there are exciting escapades and fisticuffs but the story is dark and alomst apocalyptic in some levels (check out the ending). Anyways, long story short (for the Watchmen, it is a long story) pick up this book even if you don't like comics, you won't be disappointed. It is a great read by anyone's standards.
0767836324|2.0|I have watched this one a couple times.  The boring parts are just to frequent and long.  Like the poorly done Popeye, we just wait to long for the cool stuff.  then when we get to the cool fight at the end, they kill off the Lost boy that my kids liked the best!<br />Unfortuneately I bought it on VHS before I saw it.  What saves the movie is that one can FF thru all the poor sections of the movie.  Also, why make a movie for kids and kill of the second most interesting good guy?!
1587990717|4.0|I had to laugh out loud when reading this book, for its dead-on assessments of human misunderstandings of all things statistical. I laughed again when reading some reviewers with hurt feelings, taking it personally. Taleb's book is not a \\"how-to\\" manual for traders, rather it contains a few thought-provoking nuggets about the difference between accepted dogma and what real life data tells us. Data (stock market data, income distributions, whatever) comes free of preconceived beliefs; it is ideologically neutral. Traders (and the public at large) often make the mistake of believing simple approximations to the truth because they are easy, not because they fit the facts the best. Taleb is only trying to say: don't read more into the data than is justified. PERHAPS the rich trader down the street got that way because he knew what he was doing, but remember that the distribution of wealth over the set of traders is likely the same as that given by random chance...so it's hard to tell. Think about that the next time you pony up $1000 a month for an \\"expert\\" stock-picking subscription service. I noticed that only the reviewers lacking mathematical background doubted Taleb; even in this volume devoid of equations, they still couldn't follow his argument. I guess that's what you get for pursuing an English degree. Good luck in the markets.
0312305060|3.0|The Hours was a very fluffy, full of adjective story about next to nothing.  Perhaps Cunningham wants to show us how we can be connected, but I found that the ties were weak.  And although detail is always good, we are not in the day of Flaubert's work, and the run on sentences were a bit much at times.  Did we really need every single detail of Clarissa buying flowers?  At times I began wondering if we were given all the minutae to help fill the pages.  The most intriguing of all characters is Laura, a housewife who just wants time to herself.  Virginia was there to be the common thread, but we do not see her at her craziest, or or most interesting.

0780626494|4.0|This is a movie I love.  A couple that is expecting their first child end up spending 35 years in a fall out shelter, not a bomb shelter.  The doors unlock and their now 35 year old son goes out for provisions and to find a wife.  It is a sweet, fun movie that my whole family would like.  I WOULD HAVE GIVE 5 STAR except for the language.  Not that i was counting but i heard the F word, the Sh#@ word several times and Son of a Bleep 3 times.  It ticks me off that not of this was necessary, and it turns an otherwise good movie for my whole famly into an adult only movie.<br />So have discussed their dislike of a prominent gay character \\"Troy\\".  Here I thought the director did a good job of handling Troy's role in a manner that shouldn't offend family values folks.  Troy was very well done.
0385504209|3.0|Most readers found this book entertaining.  I did too.  I started it and even stayed up one night for several hours reading when I should have been sleeping.  A couple of glaring plot defects came through, though.  1.  How did the young lady have a laser cut key which existed at least 20 years ago?  I thought laser cut keys were a fairly recent development, and, 2.  How did the butler meet the 'Teacher' without immediately recognising him?<br />BUT the obvious heavy dosage of Masonic (and several other religious persuasions) dogma is dealt out with a sledge hammer.  The book seems to assert that there is a huge library of documents that 'prove' that Jesus was only human, married Mary Magdaline, and moved to France, to sire several children.  He asserts that the Holy Bible is a product of the tinkering of the power-hungry church officials who want only to maintain their domination and control over the minds of their poor subjects.  With several other facts he has missed, he has missed the fact that the Bible was pretty much 'solidified' before the Catholic Church became the power structure that it is today.  His assertion that the extra-Biblical documents 'prove' that Jesus was merely a man constitue a gratuitous assertion, which can be gratuitously denied.  Proof of the pudding lies in the facts that the Apostles (most of them) went to the death for their faith, as did hundreds more in the first century.  I doubt that many people would die agonizing deaths for a lie.  There is also the disturbing fact of a complex mathematical code found in the New Testament writings by a Harvard Mathematician which are nearly impossible for a human writer to duplicate.  To me this code shows the finger of God in the writings.<br />Bottom Line: fun book, good story, but watch out for the propaganda.

0671027573|5.0|I've only  been reading Linda Howard's books for a couple of years now, and this is definitely my all-time favourite. Ms Howard has combined comedy, romance and suspense into one thrilling read. Sam Donovan is intensely male, Jaine Bright perfect foil for his essence. I fell in love with Sam, as I do with most of Linda Howard's male characters. This one is a 'must read' for anyone, even new Linda Howard fans.
B000069AUI|5.0|When I first heard Yellow, I definitely did not behold the greatness of Coldplay.  But as usual, I liked the other songs that didn't make the radio and one that did (Trouble).  However, A Rush of Blood to the Head blew me away.  What an incredible album.  To me it's the best thing thing that came out of 2002(even over Dave Matthews Busted Stuff, etc.).  Politik is an amazing song with overwhelming emotion and airyness.  Best Songs: God put a smile upon your face, daylight, warning sign, clocks, a whisper, and 'a rush of blood to the head'.  Though those are the best, there is not a weak track on the entire album.  Even if you've never heard Coldplay, I recommend this cd very highly.  Parachutes is good, but this one's better.

6305144176|5.0|Robin williams brings high energy to this film and welcome entertainment to boys and men who are risking their lives in a foreign land.  This movie came out at a time when most vietnam movies were gut wretching excursions into hell.  You can't get the same feel now, since better vietnam war movies have been made, the feelings towards that war have evolved.  But when this movie first appeared, as Cronauer started going off where he shouldn't go, there was always present a certain feeling of dread for his safety.  That tension balanced with the tremendous comedy created a unique experience.  The only comparison I can make is when in a MASH tv episode, Hawkeye goes off and gets stranded.  You know that the writers will never kill off Hawkeye and Alan Alda, their star.  You can't have the same tension between comedy and dread as was created in GMV.  The writers could kill off Cronauer.  We knew it.<br />That robin williams could pull this off and make this double edged sword work has always amazed this fellow suburban chicagoan.
0345413377|2.0|I'm sorry but to all of those who say that one is close-minded to say this book is evil have never believed in anything good.  I love harry potter and laugh at those who scorn it for evil because Harry Potter is on the good side whereas Lyra never knows which side she is on.  Yes, that may be human but this dehumanizes hope for a higher power (God, Buddha, Christ, Nature, Whoever) that guides us in goodness.  I especially disagree that because things are done in God's or the Authorities Name that they be God's wishes.  Almost every war is over religion and yet that doesn't mean God is leading either side.  We are humans and do what we want to be right and Pullman is saying that we do what the Authority wants which isn't always the case.  I started out loving Lyra and Will and now i feel cheated that they lead me to fight what is the truth.

B000089RVX|2.0|When their first single, \\"Bring Me To Life,\\" was first released I heard many otherwise respectable people turn into giddy little school girls.  Friends, classmates, and co-workers everywhere told me to download this song, which I had not yet heard since I don't listen to the radio much or watch MTV.  So after hearing from about twenty people I finally downloaded the song, and, to say the least, was not only disappointed, I was outraged!  How so many people could fall head over heals for this song was beyond me.<br />So then I told people I didn't like the song. ...It was shallow, and it felt like bloated, overbearing, teen-angsty trashy pop/rock.  I did, in fact, get those yells, followed by, \\"Well, try 'My Immortal.' \\"  I eventually did, and it was even worse.<br />...There isn't much else to say other than they're extremely over-hyped, and will be forgotten as quickly as they came.<br />Yes the lead singer has a fantastic voice, but until she drops this horrible band there's not a thing in the world that will get me to listen to her.

B00008OLYN|5.0|Since their emergence into the music world, Opeth have gained a reputation for their ability to combine different musical styles with their swedish death metal sound. Over their last 6 releases, Opeth have proved their ability to do this over and over again. Their previous albums all showcased their skills as death metal musicians, but they also revealed that the band possesses talent for other genres as well. \\"Damnation\\" is their first CD that completely focuses on a musical style other than metal and allows listeners to see a new side of their music that we had only gotten glimpses of before. \\"Damnation\\" marks the group's first voyage into prog territory, although it is not completely unfamiliar to them. Listening to their earlier work, a prog influence is unmistakable, especially in \\"Blackwater Park\\" and \\"Still Life\\". It's nice to see the band using their musical expertise in a new way. <br />Originally intended as a counterpart to \\"Deliverance\\",  \\"Damnation\\" is the polar opposite of the former release. \\"Deliverance\\" was about as brutal as Opeth has ver been. Given the feroscity of \\"Deliverance\\" and the mellow, relaxing sound of \\"Damnation\\", it's hard to believe that this is even the same band. The 2 albums together really show the range that Opeth has. It's too bad that they weren't released together but I guess it doesn't really matter now that they've both out anyway, but I still think that the 2 of them together would've given new listeners a good look at what the band is really about.<br />The music of \\"Damnation\\" is absolutely exquisite. It's incredibly tranquil and is very soothing. The guitar work is reminiscent of bands like Porcupine Tree and even Dream Theater to a lesser extent. Listening to this album, I was still half expecting an onslaught of Opeth's signature barbaric death metal to intrude on the mellow, melodic songs, but the interruption didn't occur once. There is absolutely no music that even half way resembles death metal on this album. While I do primarily listen to death/black metal, it was nice to be able to take a break from it. To be able to see Opeth's ability as a prog band evolve to it's full potential without having any interruptions from the realm of metal was a great experience. <br />After learning that Opeth was releasing a CD with no metal, I was rather worried that they had gone the route of In Flames (melodic metal sellouts) and wasn't sure if \\"Damnation\\" was even going to be worth getting. I've been listening to Opeth since Still Life was released and have since counted them as one of my favorite bands, and when you hear of drastic change in the style of one of your favorite bands, you can be pretty uneasy about what the future will bring, but I can assure you that I was not let down by \\"Damnation\\" and I hope that you won't be either.
B000092ZYX|3.0|It's time to be honest. The two Radiohead cds which preceded 'Hail' have been a disappointment to most people, even those who gave them good reviews. The good reviews, however, are not unfounded. Each of them displayed extraordinary talent and incredible vision. However, they represent a Radiohead which is not the leader in their field. Pop in any Aphex Twin cd to see why. The Bends and OK Computer, on the contrary, established Radiohead as the Best Rock Group in the World, possibly one of the best ever. <BR>That brings us to &quot;hail.&quot; Most reviews label it a combination of the two styles, but this is incredibly misleading. Hail is an album in the same vein as Kid A and Amnesiac, substituting unmorphed guitars and real life drum beats for the synthesized sounds of the previous two, but the song structure remains the same. Tons of loops, vocals which seem to fly above the music without much consideration for melody, and brilliant sound, interacting in ways which no one could think possible. And while the talent is clearly recognizable, no one would think Radiohead sellouts if they would throw in a hook every now and then. Overall, a very good, if unsatisfactory album.
B00009EJC5|4.0|Once the anxious collector accepts the fact that the extras are singular and not plural and that this set is basically a reissue (albeit remastered) with an extended version of an instrumental from a movie soundtrack tacked on, it's an enjoyable and enlightening offer - thanks to a *superb* job of remastering. The '70 \\"Give It Up Or Turnit A Loose\\", sans added audience sounds, and with the *band* now featured - the first vinyl issue does not have half the instrumental presence - is surely one of the most intense cuts in JB's catalogue. The original '70 release has more excitement, as the star's vocal is more prominent, but by '03 the contributions of Clyde and Bootsy, et. al, deserve full attention.<BR>It's always good to hear \\"It's A New Day\\", an uptempo tune reflecting his gospel roots a bit more than usual. \\"Talkin' Loud & Sayin' Nothing\\" is a highly successful rapp, one of the best Brown-Byrd collaborations, with an interesting stop-time section. It sure sounds like an instantaneous direction by Brown, and once again we get the gospel *feel*.<BR>The same idea is used on the decidedly worldly \\"Hot Pants...\\" - suddenly the music stops while the singer chants a cappella. (This is not the hit single version).<BR>\\"I Got To Move\\" is a '70 groove withheld until '86 and it was 16 years too long. It's assumed that there just wasn't room back in the \\"Popcorn\\"-\\"Sex Machine\\" era. It's a soaked-in-soul stream of consciousness effort from JB. Although sounding highly improvised, and appears to be based on a dance number \\"There Was A Time\\", it emerges as a deep reflection.<BR>All distortion is removed on the landmark \\"Funky Drummer\\", yes that static heard on the tail end is gone. Alot of \\"adult\\" content here but what a cut! <BR>The aforementioned instrumental, \\"Blind Man Can See It\\", is about five minutes longer than on the \\"Black Caesar\\" soundtrack, and now James' voice appears, in a short rapp. This is one of his happiest riffs, a fine selection for this reissue. <BR>Yes, atfirst the fan/collector who wants unreleased songs from the theatre on 125th Street as \\"Bonus Tracks\\" will be disappointed, but a listen to all 7:19 of this track will bring a smile.
B00008VGK0|1.0|Proof that age does in fact bring everyone down at some point. Madonna, sounding like a boring, rich housewife complaining about her wealth, has never sounded so out of touch with reality. The chorus doesn't fit the rest of the song, and it sounds like she took two song ideas and pasted them together to make one song. This approach only proves that some songs are best left on the cutting room floor.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|This is the best movie ever made for us, \\"gore hounds\\". The movie is about a group of teens who go to a cabin in the middle of Tenessee mountains, and, there, they awake a demon that lies within the Book Of The Dead. And they soon find out they're trapped in there, and there's no escape. Who will survive, if anyone?<BR>Elite Entertainment has been sucessful in this DVD edition... There are two great commentaries: one with Bruce Campbell (Main Actor, \\"Ashley\\") alone, another with Sam Raimi (Director) and Rob Tapert (Producer). They are very informative and fun. There is a Still Gallery featuring more than 150 photos too, awesome pics... The Theatrical Trailer is here too, along with Charpter Selection and a 20-minute \\"making-of\\". It's not exactly a making-of, but it has behind-the-scenes footage and some alternative takes. The menus are animated too.<BR>The sound in 5.1 is great, no complains at all. It's a full screen edition (no complains too, because my TV is not widescreen, you see..). Unfortunately this edition is not captioned, but it won't make me take out any of those 5-stars. <BR>The movie has Approx. 85 minutes, and it's Unrated (well, it's actually NC-17, because of brutal violence and gore). This DVD is only worst than the Book Of The Dead Edition (by Anchor Bay), and that is all.
048629823X|3.0|This is not the best translation. The Walter J. Black,Inc.  1944 Classic Club Edition is better, but either way it is just Marcus Aurelius trying to remind himself (over and over again) of the basic stoic theory that as long as we know what pertains to us and what doesn't and avoid gettting emotional about what doesn't pertain to us,  all will be fine and tranquil within our souls.  It reads like the book of Proverbs, jumping from topic to topic without much organization and with lots of repetition of the same basic themes with a few word changes.  Many times, I felt like I was reading a remake of Epictetus Discourses, only not as well written by any stretch of the imagination.  Not much of anything new or original, just a follower of a philosophy better stated by Epictetus (or should I say his student admirer, Arrian, who wrote the Discourses from first hand lectures he had heard.)
B00000724P|5.0|one of the greatest... albums of all time! only second to master of puppets. Good sound quality.I can't really decide which is Metallica's brutallest album. Either lightning, puppets, or justice.there is not a bad song on here. Don't get the import version it's not worth it. the bonus track &quot;The Prince&quot; isn't worth the extra... bucks. However, tracks like &quot;Blackened&quot;, &quot;Eye of the beholder&quot; and &quot;Dyers eve&quot; make it one of the finest metal releases evr. Rock on Dudes!
B00009ATKS|5.0|Mogwai's music inspires waves of hyperbole, none of which does justice to the massive and detailed sound of the band. Detractors might have once accused them of relying too heavily on the soft/loud/soft formula, especially after the often gorgeous, but predictable, Come On Die Young. But that record contained hints of a new creative direction that crystallized on Rock Action, one of 2001's standout rock albums. There Mogwai diversified its bag of tricks, employing sophisticated post-production techniques and a heightened sense of musical economy to further balance the warring poles of minimalism and cacophony. <br />Happy Songs for Happy People continues to work on the grounds established by Rock Action, but it also draws readily from Action's precursors. The result is an album that blends and distills Mogwai's most satisfying elements down to a near-perfect 41 minutes. Happy Songs is epic and subtle, technically savvy and emotionally charged and visceral all at once -- in short, it's a summary of everything that is great about Mogwai's music. <br />The progression marked by Happy Songs is exemplified by \\"Killing All the Flies,\\" a song that condenses Mogwai's sprawling sonic oscillations into a tightly wound four-and-a-half minutes. The familiar hyper-driven guitars duck in and out of the mix of submerged vocals and electronic manipulations, capturing the ornate sense of grandeur that is Mogwai at its best, in half the time. This might not be the best song on the album, but it is perhaps the most emblematic of the record's driving aesthetic. <br />In actuality, time spent identifying a standout track among this nine-song collection is futile. Happy Songs for Happy People is a great record due in no small part to its cohesion, its uninterrupted flow. No small accomplishment, especially given the weight of the material. What are most surprising are guitarist Stuart Braithwaite's vocal contributions. On earlier records, his subtle but captivating voice required specialattention, but now it perfectly assumes the role of an orchestral instrument, as best heard on \\"Boring Machines Disturbs Sleep.\\" This is meant neither to diminish the power of earlier songs (such as Action's \\"Take Me Somewhere Nice\\") nor to claim that his vocals have a reduced role on the current collection. This, like all aspects of the band's repertoire, exists on Happy Songs in its purest form. Nothing detracts, everything's essential. <br />Robert Albanese <BR>Junkmedia.org Review
0800177177|4.0|This movie is one of the greatest movies ever made, best vampire movie ever out there, a surely 5-star.. It's based on Bram Stocker's best-seller Dracula. This is as close as the movies can get to the original book, and, in my opinion, the best Dracula movie ever made.<BR>Starring stars such as Keanu Reeves, who is rocking with the Matrix movies today; Gary Oldman, perfect as Dracula; Anthony Hopkins, as Van Helsing; and Winoma Ryder, great in her role. Great acting, make-up, special effects for that year (1992)... This movie won 3 Oscars in 1992 Academy Awards (Best Costume Design / Best Make-Up / Best Sound Effects Editing).<BR>As you see, the movie is great, but the edition is not... The movie didn't diserve this edition... NO EXTRAS AT ALL! Not even a Theatrical Trailer, Talent Bios or Commentary... Absolutely nothing... And this is really sad.<BR>The sound is awesome in 5.1 (thank God it's avaliable in this DVD edition). It's a 2-Side DVD, in side A, the movie is presented in widescreen; in side B, standart (much better, in my opinion). There are 52 charpters in this DVD. It's captioned in English, Spanish, Korean and French.<BR>A Francis F. Coppola's masterpiece in a poor DVD edition. Only worth for the movie and the 5.1 sound. But, like I said, it's definetly worth your money..

B000002H2H|5.0|I love this album. Some of the best songs ever written. My only beef is the sound quality and James' vocals aren't the best of his career. But they fixed that right up with their next two albums. While evrything metallica does is great, this is one of the greatest. If you are looking to get into thrash, or just metAL IN GENERAL, mETALLICA'S FIRST FOUR ALBUMS ARE THE FIRST FOUR ALBUMS YOU SHOULD BUY.
0064471837|5.0|I saw this book in a Library, and knew nothing about it, but that it looked interesting. I had no idea that I would be swept away on an amazing journey. Sabriel has spent most of her life on the other side of the wall in Ancestierre. When an unexpected summons comes and calls her too her destiny as Abhorsen in the Old Kingdom, she must make many decisions about life, death, love and fate. An amazing read that will keep people of all ages intrigued and wound together in its spell.
0804106304|5.0|When I first read this book at the age of twelve, it was the best book I had ever read. It was moving, poignant, and easy to understand. I've read it three times since then and it remains one of my favorite novels of all time.
0142004235|5.0|One of the most significant vignettes in this book appears in the opening to Chapter 13, wherein Steinbeck appropriately recognizes humans as our planet's sole creative species, and champions the concept of individuality.<br />He wrote, \\"And this I believe:  that the free, exploring mind of the individual human is the most valuable thing in the world.  And this I would fight for:  the freedom of the mind to take any direction it wishes undirected.  And this I must fight against:  any idea, religion, or government which limits or destroys the individual.  This is what I am and what I am about.  I can understand why a system built on a pattern must try to destroy the free mind, for that is one thing which can  by inspection destroy such a system.  Surely I can understand this, and I hate it and I will fight against it to preserve the one thing that separates us from the uncreative beasts.  If the glory can be killed, we are lost.\\"<br />This is part of the reason a book such as \\"East of Eden\\" will continue to be read for pleasure, for study and for enlightenment -- whereas some communistic political hack's ghost-written piecemeal autobiography is destined by its nature to be a mere flash in the pan, and nobody will ever read it again after she has departed the stage.
0452282152|5.0|This is a fascinating story based on a mysterious painting. It's addictive and beautifully written. My one complaint is that the ending seemed to me like it lacked...something. It just wasn't as spectacular as one would expect from a book this great.
B00008PX8P|5.0|An open letter to Mr. Jimmy Page:<BR> Dear Jimmy,<BR>  Thank you, thank you, thank you...I think you get the point.  I am writing this review of my now favorite concert DVD ( I have over 20!) as a letter to you to emphasize how grateful I am that you took the time and effort to bring to this new medium that is so perfect for live music something extra special.  Led Zeppelin really was THE band of the 70's, and to remind us all of that fact with such a quality package of sights and sounds is really a testament of the power of the band's music.  I was fortunate enough to see you twice in the early 70's and was awestruck both times (even though the acoustics of the venue were awful to poor),  but until I listened to this DVD, and the new triple live CD, I really had no idea just how great you all sounded.  Those of you reading this letter that are Zeppelin fans but never got to see a live show, you must get these two gifts from Mr. Page to really experience what incredible sounds we were witnesses to in the heyday of Rock.  The version of &quot;Achillies Last Stand&quot; from the 1979 show in Knebworth is worth the price of the DVD alone, and &quot;Black Dog&quot; and &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; from the CD makes the extra 16 bucks a bargain.  The only negative thing I have to say about either item is that I was sadly reminded of how much we all lost the day John Bonham died. The studio really didn't capture his greatness, did it? <BR>  Once again, thank you for this gift, Mr Jimmy Page.
B000069AUI|5.0|This is one of the best-produced albums to come out in years. Excellent work.
0385509456|4.0|This is a very unusual novel mostly because of the narrator's autism. Simple to read, the novel has an interesting rhythm to it as the reader becomes more familiar with Christopher's disability. While I initially thought it would become repetitive, the story takes some turns to make it a consistently enjoyable reading experience.<br />Christopher begins to write the book to solve the mystery of the murder of Wellington, a neighbor's dog, like his hero Sherlock Holmes. Along the way, we learn about his family situation, his view of the world, his idiosyncrasies, and his school life. He's not exactly an unreliable narrator, but the author does an excellent job of imagining the problems involved when the storyteller has autism and the story is consistent with this perspective.<br />While not a perfect book, I would recommend this highly, especially to people who want a fresh and different reading experience. It's not at all preachy, and it deals with a little understood disability with honesty; this reader came away from the book with a new understanding of the difficulties of dealing with autism. It is well worth your time to pick this one up.
B00003CXHJ|1.0|This movie attempts to present itself as an historically based submarine adventure. Unfortunately, it is grossly inaccurate historically, to the point of being insulting;especially to the Brits. They seized an enigma device before we even entered the war. The submarine warfare is so over the top it's absurd. If you want to see crazy stunts and over the top action I'd recommend a good Bond film. If you want to see a great WW2 submarine flick, see Das Boot. Forget about this turkey.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Has anyone asked you who u rather prefer either Christina Aguilera or Britney Spears? YOU BETTA SAY CHRISTINA and this CD is totally awesome I hate most POP but I love Christina she is beautiful and sexual and not afraid to show it. She has an amazing voice and a great personality. Every Song on this cd is fabulous and will make u push repeat about a thousand times. The other thing that I love about Christina is that she isn't Decisive about whether or not she is a sexual or a goody pop icon which I love she just is sexual and I love that and she isn't Britney which I love too thanks Christina for Changing and I love her new CD its the best from the best!
B00005JLT5|5.0|I watched tis movie last night, and I was really moved by it.I admit while watching it, I thought about other Holocaust movies I've seen. This one seemed very personal,and very lonely.Director Roman Polanski,did a great job of letting me feel the human condition of an oppressed people.The bonus material in the DVD version was also helpful.<BR>I thought Adrien Brody was most beautifully expressive.<BR>This movie is a must see.I will buy the DVD for my collection.
B0000A36J5|5.0|If you liked The Two Towers in theatres, there is no doubt you will drool over this Extended Edition coming out this November.  It is packed with hours of special features and over 30 minutes of new added-in film footage.  One thing you also need to keep in mind is that the special features are totally new and different from the theatrical DVD.  If you want those special features (trailers, Gollum's Song music video, etc.) you'll have to buy that DVD also.  If you aren't sure if this box set is worth paying for, just check out the Extended Edition for The Fellowship of the Ring.  If you like that Extended Edition, this one will be yet another masterpiece you have to own.  I have also heard that we will be introduced to Denethor, a character from The Return of the King.  No, I haven't watched The Two Towers Extended Edition yet, but I can already tell you this edition of the film will be a must-have.  Your DVD collection will not be complete without The Two Towers Extended Edition.
B000066NW0|5.0|Alright, don't get me wrong, but you may be confused. See i rated the cd 5 stars but have a title that's not very complementary. See, I love her music, i really do, there's not a single song I don't like. (Tomorrow and I'm With You took a little while, but oh well) But it's HER i can't stand!!! She thinks she's SOOOOOOO unique when really she's just another preppy poser that I hate!!!!!!!! She says she's so different and she doesn't care what people think, when really, she does, and she is just pretending so people will like her! I find it ironic that what she sings about in \\"Complicated\\" is not at all what she TRULY lives by. It's people like her that give true unique people who like to express their individuality (SUCH AS MYSELF!) a bad name. We truly need to take her out with the trash and make our superficial world a better place.
B000002UB6|5.0|I have always enjoyed reading reviews of my favorite records, but haven't felt compelled to write one of my own until now.  Forgive me if this comes out somewhat...er...unprofessional.<BR>First off, I love the Beatles, in my eyes, they can do no wrong.  Let it Be is one of my absolute favorite Beatles.  The sound, in my opinion, is excellent, very raw and emotional (except Spector should have kept his damn hands off this).  To echo some other reviews, it is hard to believe that these guys were fighting when they made this record.  The irreverance and plain fun that permeates tracks such as \\"Dig It,\\" and the focus and genius of tracks such as \\"Let it Be\\" and \\"Two of Us,\\" makes you wonder...<BR>My favorite tracks would have to be \\"Dig a Pony,\\" \\"Across the Universe,\\" \\"I Me Mine,\\" and \\"One After 909\\" (I'm a big John and George fan).  But the entire album is excellent.<BR>And another thing about Phil Spector...his career should have ended in the 60s.  Listen to the Ramones' End of the Century for more of his butchering of great rock and roll.<BR>Otherwise, great stuff.
0066214122|4.0|Michael Crichton's latest work comes in a most unexpected way.  I found Prey to be a refreshing change from the usual Sci-Fi novel fare.<br />The book revolves around a man named Jack Forman, an unemployed but brilliant computer programmer who had created a 'Predator-Prey' software program.  After a series of bizarre incidents, Jack is mysteriously called back by his former employers to go to a lab in the Nevada desert.  Once there, Jack realizes the horrifying truth: his 'Pred-Prey' program has been used to create a new type of nano-technology that would be used by the government as a high-tech surveillance device.  But something has gone horribly wrong.  A large swarm of the nano-machines has escaped into the Nevada desert, and it is evolving at an alarming rate.  Not only is it learning to adapt, but it is also preying on living things to sustain itself.  The swarm must be destroyed, but doing so may prove more difficult than anyone had ever imagined.<br />Now you may be asking yourself &quot;So what's so scary about a cloud of microscopic machine particles?&quot;  Well, leave it to Crichton to make something like that scary!  The vague summarization I gave doesn't do the book justice.  Its more of a brief synopsis to pique your interest.  The book actually consists of 3 parts.  The entire first part of the book revolves around Jack's life as an at-home dad.  Huge problems are devoloping with his wife Julia, who he suspects is having an affair, and his inability to land a job is getting to him.  This entire section of the book is great because of the sheer amount of character development.  Many complain about this part of the book moving too slowly, but I found it to be quite interesting.  In fact, I wouldn't have cared as much about the character of Jack Forman had this section not been so thorough.  One reviewer throws a hissy fit over the interaction between Jack and his kids: a young teenage girl, a pre-pubescent punk little boy, and a baby daughter.  I mustsay I found nothing wrong with the dialog between them.  Anyone with kids could tell you that the dialog pretty much sums up your typical teenager and punk little kid with complete accuracy.  The character development alone is one of the book's best qualities.<br />After the first portion of the book, we are transported to the lab in the Nevada desert, where the action takes place.  I admit that when I first read the blurb about this book I was skeptical.  I approached it with limited interest, but once I started reading it I was intrigued.  By the second part of the book, Crichton hits you with so much technical and scientific information that its almost too much to take in.  But if you read through it and allow your brain to absorb it, the explanations become clear.  The concept of why the nano-swarm attacks and 'devours' its prey is explained...and even if you don't catch it, its not difficult to grasp.  Once you realize what the base structure of the nano-machines are, it becomes obvious why they must attack and devour. <br />Even so, there are details that are left out which would tend to confuse the reader.  Also, I found myself somewhat disinterested in a few of the side characters.  Crichton introduces them briefly but never goes into much detail about them, which results in a rather unconcerned attitude towards those characters.  Otherwise, the characters that have an impact develop over the rest of the book rather well.<br />The action in the book is pretty well done.  I felt a sense of urgency for Jack, and there were some parts during the book that made me cringe.  Other parts were exciting, others were nerve-racking, and most were just plain tense.  It was tough to put the book down, and when I got to the final third of the book I found myself reading non-stop until the end.<br />One of the most remarkable and impressive aspects of the book has got to be the Bibliography.  When you see how much painstaking research went into the book, you'll realize that all that technical mumbo-jumbo that Crichton spewed out on so many of those pages is actually relevant, and you'll appreciate the work that went into it and be able to take in all the knowledge.  It almost seems too incredible and ubeleivable to be real, but most of the information that Crichton put into the book was entirely accurate, which takes the book up a notch (and makes the future of technology seem not quite as safe anymore...).<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Its never gets so technical that you just want to put it down, and it never really drags either.  Its definitely not another Jurassic Park, but its a worthy read nonetheless.  If you're looking for a book that will entertain and thrill you, then pick up Prey.  Its not going to be the next Great American Novel, and if you're expecting an utter masterpiece then you will be disappointed.  I see alot of criticism for this book that is just completely asinine.  Either people need to lay off the No-Doze or they just need to be able to keep an open mind and accept this book for what it is: a well-researched, science fiction/science fact adventure that will keep you reading til the end.  I won't go as far as saying that this is one of the best books I've ever read, but when I was finished with it, it just felt good to read an intriguing and entertaining book.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|First off, the energy on this album is equal to that of lightning! The band continues to unleash raw power through powerful, hypnotic beats and butt kickin' , screaming guitars! Most of all, Sully's vocals are above and beyond any previous album! For the ladies...just one listen to \\"make me believe\\", and \\"serenity\\", you'll FEEL what I mean!! For those who haven't heard the whole album, I strongly suggest listening all the way through, each song is unique and with deep felt emotions that pump your adrenaline to an all time high! This is NOT one of those albums with only 1 or 2 good songs! This album rocks not only your world, but the neihbors' too! Mine are hooked now! Yes, I am a true die hard Godsmack fan, more since the impressive new release, \\"Faceless\\"!! It leaves me with a hunger for more, and respect for the talent these men posses. If you have never heard anything by Godsmack, you are missing out! I feel that I can personally relate to every song! Especially the power house \\"I f*&%#ing hate you\\"! If you can't relate to this one, you must be a hermit!!! A great way to release anger on the drive home, if ya know what I mean! Godsmack is HOT, Sully is on fire!!!! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!

B00005JLEU|5.0|... and thank God for that!  And, like some of the other reviewers said, we don't really need an intro in front of the film.  Yes, yes, we know, Disney released it, but so what?<br />I suggest this: switch to the original Japanese track and turn on the English sub-title.  It's better that way.  Not that the &quot;English-speaking&quot; cast didn't do a great job, it just is not the same.
B000001G8R|1.0|THIS CD is not playable on normal CD players; it is made for \\"Super Audio\\" ONLY.  No warning of this is indicated on the Amazon listing.
B00005JKZV|2.0|How can this film have been so bad after the wonderful work we were treated to in the first movie?  The noble Ents are poorly done \\"Rock-biters\\" (See \\"Never-ending Story\\") and have lost the wisdom and nobility they had in books.  How could the same crew that wowed us with the Balrog give us jerky, fake looking Ents?  The dragons look slightly less menacing than a sick salamander and show the same shoddy work given the Ents.  Golum as a character was great.  The battle between both personalities was fun to watch, but here again the CGI work was lacking.  I was disappointed that even here in our new star of the film the muscle tone isn't performing as it should.  When limbs flex, muscles bulge and crease around the joints.  Other CGI characters have shown this, why not Golum?  Mary and Pippin have been reduced to no importance at all and the movie has changed the path that Frodo and Sam took (and sadly, not for the better).  Changes in the book are fine if done well (like the first movie) but the changes here have watered the story down and caused me to lose my enthusiasm for this work.
B000068OCS|1.0|I have rated this dvd 1 star, not the film itself.  The film is a masterpeice, and an important piece of art.  This dvd version of it is a piece of horse poop!<br /><br />If you have never seen this film, I suppose the way it is framed in this version might not really bother you, but if you actually CARE to see the film as was originally presented, THIS ISN'T IT!<br /><br />I am not sure exactly HOW they managed to frame this transfer so poorly, but if ineptitude is a virtue, these folks go to the head of the class.<br /><br />I won't get into the technical terms of aspect ratio, framing, and the like, but suffice it to say, this release LACKS a good amount of the original image.  The image on the screen might be presented in the original apsect, but the framing of that aspect was done in such a way as to \\"zoom\\" too far in, thus eradicating, in my estimation, approx. 15-20% of the original image.  In a film like Koyaanisqatsi, where the artist's framing of the image is so critical, changing the original image by framing it this way is unforgivable...well...maybe merely a waste of time and money.<br /><br />The frustrating thing for me was that the \\"full screen\\" vhs release actually gives the viewer a closer approximation of the original!<br /><br />I won't go on and on about it, but like I said before;  If you want the original, you're going to have to wait.  I suppose there is a laser disc version out there that is framed properly, but that's not really much help!<br /><br />Save your dough!<br /><br />&lt;edit 2016><br /><br />I got into a brutal argument years ago with someone who worked on the last of the trilogy about the aspect ratio. I now understand what the deal was between all the formats, and, the simple explanation is that of the three version that are available, the IRE limited release, the MGM release, and the new blue ray, is that the IRE version, although not in widescreen shows the most visual information of the three. If you want to see comparisons of the three formats, this link is great; [...]<br /><br />The long and the short is that, against all logic, the fullscreen version shows more of the film than the widescreen version.<br /><br />Last, good luck finding the IRE version!e short is that, against all logic, the fullscreen version shows more of the film than the widescreen version.    Last, good luck finding the IRE version!
B00005JLET|4.0|Never before have my three children (10, 8, 4) been so enthralled with a movie. After their 4th or 5th viewing, I had to see for myself. Words can't describe the theme, but it is very captivating. My 8-year-old daughter said it's about a girl who has to find her way back from another world...<br />So true. A world of spirits and of friendship, of trust and mistrust. A wonderful chidren's movie, yet a lot of offering for the adult soul too.<br />You have to view for yourself...
B00005JKN9|1.0|Don't buy into the hype, this was one of the worst movies of 2002.  The acting was marginal, except for Daniel Day Lewis who did a great job.  The story line was terrible.  The script is terrible. How much symbolism do you need in one movie?  I would not suggest this movies to one person, it'll have you wishing you had 2 hours back in your life.

B00005JM1Y|3.0|This film has already been released here in Colombia, which is weird since usually films arrive here late rather than before they are released in U.S.A. I saw two days ago and well, I have a things to say to the audiences from the states. You could say this film is a mixture between Naked Gun, Bean and Austin Powers. One thing I found negative about it is that it copies jokes from various comedies, I don't want to be a spoiler so I won't say which, but some of the jokes will seem very familiar. But the good thing about it is that is not a waste of a film, and Rowan Atkinson proves that he can also be funny talking. I think he did quite well as the other James Bond spoof. He is not as exagerated as Mike Myers, so this film is different. And he managed to stay away from the Bean persona, something I was afraid of. The plot is as simple as Bond plots are today, only with various comedy twists. Johnny English starts as Monneypenny, he is just a in this particular film, MI7 clerk, until every agent is wiped off(funny situation that will not be revealed here) so he has to take on the biggest mission that was pending, which involves the crown jewels and a french tycoon in the sort of Goldfinger played by John Malkovich, who did his best to perform the character with dignity, and I think he escapes from stinking by the fingernails. The film is carried out just like Bond movies, the agent meets the girl, the villan, something happens, he gets close to something, he fails, he gets close to the girl, the bad guy almost makes it, but fails and gets busted, endind with the agent and the girl. Very straightforward, but every situation is filled not to the brim, which I think was the smart thing to do, with funny situations. And although many of the jokes are rip-offs, Atkinson managed to make them his own. The film is very short, but feels longer, I don't know why. The end is rather stupid, but I admit that it stirrs laughter, not because of the situation but because you can't help but crack up with Atkinson's face. I don't think many people will like, unlike the Bean skits and the film, I think some will find it stupid and unnecessary, but nevertheless, I think is a fun movie, and if somehow people get tired of or don't want to see either Matrix Reloaded, or Hulk, or X2, or T3, or any of the other box-office killers, try to tke about and hour and twenty minutes to see a silly but funny little comedy that spoofs James Bond. I don't think it will be a hit, and if it is, oh the humanity, because it's far from being great, but it's worth the money, specially in summer vacation when there is basically \\"nothing\\" to do. See all of the other summer pop corn movies before this one, otherwise you will probably hate it beacuse you could have seen something else. But it won't be a total waste of money, you will laugh because it's not at all a stupid teen flick with disgusting sexual situations and fluids, sounds and smells. It has it it's own very silly and simple way, integrity and dignity, it's hard to find, but it is there. One star for Atkinson's performance, the other for being balance in it's jokes, the other because it doesn't fall apart like many comedies, in stupidity and desperate necesity for a laugh, and the last one because it basically does not totaly stink.

1563898586|4.0|I was never much of a comic-book reader as a kid (back in the fifties), but I've developed a fondness for graphic novels in the past decade or so. Not super hero stuff (except for Moore's Watchmen, of course) but \\"real\\" stories set in the present or past. Reasonably real, anyway. This one is a high-Victorian adventure involving such literary greats as Alan Quartermain (fallen on hard times as a result of drug-dependence), Capt. Nemo (here interpreted as a renegade from the Subcontinent), the Invisible Man (a deeply sociopathic character), and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (suffering from a bipolar disorder of some magnitude), all of whom are collected Wilhelmina Murray, who has reverted to her maiden name following an unnamed horrible experience the previous year. She working under the instructions of Mr. Bond and \\"M\\" (who is suspected of being Mycroft Holmes, . . . but that initial can stand for a number of things), who are trying to save the world from the criminal use of cavorite. I often find that in even the best graphic novel, the story is not nearly as well produced as the artwork, and that's also the case here -- but the discrepancy is rather small this time. And the art is very well done indeed, especially the flow from one panel to the next and the use of slight changes in facial expression or body language to make a point. There are some really lovely details, too, like the bad guys in corsets. I shall waiting with anticipation for the next volume.

B00005JLK1|4.0|While some of the scenarios in this movie are predictable, I still found it a good, fast paced thriller.  This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and does have some pretty unexpected turns.  Gabriel Byrne turns in a good performance as the salvage boat Captain who tries in vain to keep his crew intact.  There are a few pretty gorey scenes for those who like that sort of thing, begining with the start and prologue to the old ship's story.  This is definitely a must have movie for thriller buffs.
0142004235|1.0|Why is this a bad choice for anyone looking for lesiure reading?  First, it is incredibly long, around 600 pages if I remember correct.  Second, it is very difficult to follow due to the number of characters involved and number of plots going on.  Third, and most importantly, it is incredibly boring.  This book is completely uninteresting and turning the pages becomes more of chore than a pleasure.<br />If memory serves, this book was to be Steinbeck's crowning jewel.  Thus, it comes off as contrived and, as with all things overly planned, too complex.
B000093FLA|5.0|Sorry, I don't agree at all with the editorial review.  This film keeps one's attention glued to it as the various story lines and characters interact.  I found this movie not only to be action packed, but hilariously so.  While Brad Pitt is genius in the role of a gypsy bare-knuckle fighter, Jason Statham, with poker faced portrayal of a illegal fight promoter is his best role yet.  He makes you laugh with his slightly sarcastic remarks and his seeming confusion about just how he got himself mixed up with this crazy gypsy and the most dangerous fight promoter by the name of Brick Top who has an unhealthy affinity for pigs.  I never tire of watching this movie and find myself laughing each time I do.  I highly recommend this movie to all those who like action and humor.

Te puedo decir que si te gustaron otros libros como La Casa de los Espiritus, Eva Luna, o Hija de la Fortuna este libro te va a gustar tambien.  Es como un extracto de todos los otros con un toque mas personal, haria una buena introduccion para los otros libros que ha escrito. Yo lo lei en espaol primero, y luego me di cuenta que debia regalarselo a todos esos \\"gringos\\" que escuchan mis historias de Chile (que son parecidas a muchas de otros paises de Latino America), que por supuesto parecen exajeradas o absurdas pero que ahora tengo a la misma Isabel Allende para confirmar. Primero se lo di a mi ex-jefa, a la cual le encanto. Y mi amiga se lo va a regular a su esposo, un Norte Americano de prototipo. <BR>Este libro describe tan bien lo que yo senti cuando deje mi pais que mas e una vez se me ha caido una lagrima en mi viaje a casa desde New York City. Se lo recomeindo a cualquiera que haya dejado su patria.<BR>Me gusta leer a Allende porque sus personajes femeninos son siempre mujeres luchadoras, las cuales me han dado inspiracion al igual que la vida de la autora.<BR>Gracias Isabel por todos los buenos momentos que me haz dado a travez de los aos, cuando en muchos momentos agrios un libro tuyo me ayudo a salir del paso. Realmente impagable.<BR>Una joven compatriota.
B00006IUL7|3.0|While it has a decent plot and the excellent talents of Al Pacino, Robin Williams, and Hilary Swank, this movie goes a little too dark.  This is another one I'll probably give away.  This movie's sluggish take on what was probably a great plot ruins it's appeal to thriller lovers.  It dragged on so slowly that when it was over I was actually relieved  While the main characters put in excellent jobs of acting, this movie moves along so slowly that it's almost painful.  The beautiful Alaskan scenes are marred by the movie itself.  Again, boring, boring, boring.
0375703764|5.0|Complex, interesting, dark and heavy, House of Leaves is not a book meant for the lazy readers. If you want a story focused on events instead of characterizations, plots instead of tones, easy-to-read events instead of having (literally) to skip white pages, go back and forth, turning the book upside down, etc. then don't even think about buying it. This work is a true work of art, and only few (VERY few) books published in the last decade will have such an impact on literature (and anyone who reads it, of course). The meaning of the book is truly inmmense and it has actually changed my mind about the way I used to look at my own house and what it meant to me. But that is personal.
B000092ZYX|5.0|There is no denying that Radiohead are music critics' pets. I don't think I've ever read a negative review of one of their albums in a single magazine. As a fan, I have to admit that I have a similar bias. I also admit that after Amnesiac, an album that took a very long time to grow on me, I was frightened by the territory that Thom and company may be treading next. I'm not sure what I was afraid of... a minimalist electronica album? New Age boredom? I should have known that I had nothing to worry about. Radiohead has never disappointed me before. On the contrary, they do nothing less than inspire me and drop my jaw. This album (HTTT) is full of enough sonic surprises, rhythm changes, and introspective lyrics sung in Yorke's alien voice to keep one exploring it for quite a while. You'll need more than the album's running time (nearly an hour) to fully get into it. Those who haven't been introduced to the band's work yet should probably start with The Bends and OK Computer before trying this album. So once the songs become overly familiar, does Hail to the Thief continue to please? I wouldn't know. After about 25 listens, I'm still hearing things I had not heard before.
0194313425|5.0|This is great book. I bought it almost 10 years ago when I was a &quot;intermediate lerner&quot; and I still use it to refresh my memory from time to time.<BR>It has very clear examples and explanations.<BR>You may read it back to back, you may also jump directly to the topic of interest, because each section is self contained. <BR>It is not burdened by contrived stories about improbable characters running through other intermediate books.

B00005B36H|5.0|Some people think TOOL has changed as a band. And yes, the sound has been a little different throughout the years, but it always comes with the TOOL style. This album rips and is no different then nema, Undertow, Salival, or Opiate.<BR>The lyrics are straight from the heart. Maynard writes like no other artist I know. Such emotion, anger, love, sadness. And the people that don't understand that, are the people who will not like this album. Take \\"The Patient\\" for instance. That is my favorite song off the CD. This song can be directly related to \\"H.\\" from nema. Same idea. A little different musical style. But Maynard still rips the vocals. Danny Caery still pounds on the drums. Justin Chancellor is still struming on that Bass. And Adam Jones is still pounding out the guitar, and occasionally providing some back up vocals.<BR>TOOL is still TOOL. If you want to talk ...about them selling out, then obviously you haven't listened to \\"Hooker With A Penis.\\"<BR>That's all there is. A Great addition to the TOOL collection.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This was the best movie.  I loved it!  Definately on my all time favorites list.  I have two young daughters at the perfect age to watch this movie and I bought it for myself.  It is so different.  I have never seen anything like it.  I had seen Kiki's Delivery Service in the past.  I like that one fine...Spirited Away beats that out a thousand times over.  The story is much more sophisticated (as animation anyway).  It was nothing like I expected and I was in total awe of  it.  I loved his take on the spirit world.  The main character was very likeable and enchanting.  I love seeing a female heroin and I think its a good movie for my two girls to be exposed to.  It really gives them a break from that \\"Princess\\" mentality.  Loved it!!
0316096199|2.0|The story was a good, strong story, but the read was so sloooow.  She writes very well, but to me, it's seems so slow.  Perhaps she needed more elaboration and interactions with the characters.
B00000DQR4|4.0|If you loved Mellon Collie, then you must listen to its necessary companion. It includes 33 tracks (5 of them are the Mellon Collie A-sides), out of which you can find all the B-sides. There are 6 covers, 2 James Iha compositions, 1 Corgan/Iha instrumental, and one huge, mostly instrumental, 23-minute collage of bits and snippets of outtakes and rehearsals of 1993-1995 sessions. The rest is pure Corgan. It all makes an almost 2-hour set.<BR>    Seems excessive? Maybe so. But it shows a breathtaking span of styles, moods and qualities. There's screaming heavymetal (\\"God\\"), distorted guitars a la 70s (\\"Tribute to Johnny\\"), naive charming pop (\\"The Boy\\"), simple but intense ballads (\\"Cherry\\"), country-ish attempts (\\"Meladori Magpie\\"), anthem-like serious songs (\\"The Last Song\\", a ballad, or \\"The Aeroplane Flies High, Turns Left, Looks Right\\", a rocker), acoustic straightforward confessions (\\"Blank\\"), devastatingly tender chants (\\"Medellia of the Great Skies\\", \\"Rotten Apples\\"), and even a 1920s song, \\"My Blue Heaven\\", with only voice, piano and cello. In \\"...Said Sadly\\" James Iha sings with the then-Veruca Salt vocalist Nina Gordon.<BR>    I think more or less one half of the songs could have made it into yet another album; the other half is for the curious or the die-hard fans. But the best part is really worth it. Some of the songs could have been great singles, such as \\"Transformer\\". It's a pity many of those tracks aren't listened to in the radio.<BR>    The covers show some influences on the group: The Cure, Blondie, Alice Cooper, The Cars, Missing Persons and George Whiting & Walter Donaldson (the 1920s guys).<BR>     There's an assorted mixture of approaches, but it is truly amazing those 28 tracks were recorded at the same time as those 28 found in Mellon Collie. More than 40 written by Corgan only!<BR>    The packaging is lush, and the 44-page booklet includes all the lyrics, plus many b/w photos of the Mellon Collie tour (taken by Corgan's girlfriend, Yelena Yemchuk), plus all the complete discography of the group until 1996, plus a literary Corgan introduction (a short text).<BR>    (By the way, the booklet's page 1 opens with a beautuiful b/w photograph of a black swan, no doubt one of the earliest hints to the name of Corgan's current band, Zwan.)<BR>    All in all, I love this box set.
B00008NRI9|2.0|TWO WEEKS NOTICE is clearly an attempt by director Marc Lawrence to herald in what he hoped would be this generation's Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn. What made Tracy and Hepburn resonate with the audience was that despite their on-air bickering, one could see that there was a core of misguided, if not misplaced, emotion bubbling to reach the surface. But with Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock, what became apparent from the opening reel was that while both have the star power individually to carry a romantic movie, collectively they simply do not bounce off one another in a manner that lets the audience grow to care about their deliberately emphasized differences. And in films like TWO WEEKS NOTICE, it is the degree to which the audience connects to these differences that mark such movies as truly engaging experiences. Unfortunately, TWO WEEKS NOTICE does not ring true in any area that counts.<br />Hugh Grant is George Wade, a multimillionaire real esate developer who is rich in name only. His more unattractive brother has wisely allowed him to stand as the sexy and successful symbol for Wade Enterprises. George is unabashedly handsome in the self-deprecating manner that has long since been the essential Hugh Grant trademark. He flits from affair to affair, all of which costs him plenty, but since he has his rich brother's money to back him up, he can afford to buy a hot dog and pay for it with a $100 bill, and not ask for change. In his job as company spokesman, he is incredibly incompetent. He does not even know what suit to wear for a social function, much less decide when and where to build a monstrous condo that only a Trump would love. Enter Lucy Kelson (Sandra Bullock) who is everything that George is not. He is egotistical, hedonistic, and much aware of his shortcomings in business acumen. Lucy is modest, altruistic, but possessed of a huge ego that manifests itself in a desire to Save the World from evil developers like George Wade. Now these differences might have been enough to generate humor and audience attachment to the actors had these actors showed even a glimmer of compatability. Instead, director Lawrence tries to show a Tracy-Hepburn sense of appealing squaking by contrasting some rather appalling scenes of grossness. Lucy Kelson has just eaten a chili dog that she warns is about to make an unexpected appearance. George is then forced to find a handy toilet, and since both are in a car on the FDR Highway, it takes somes some doing to resolve in a way that is more nasty than humorous. Far too many of similar such scenes remind the audience that what they are watching are actors trying vainly to be lightly and humorously romantic. Not for one moment can one willingly suspend one's belief to enter the world of a romantic comedy that Grant and Bullock try so hard but in vain to achieve. The fault is not theirs, since both are appealing in scenes in which they appear solo. The problem is a poor script that relies too heavily on the sight gag and the pratfall. I would like to see them try again, but this time with a plot that does not suggest that the entire process of filming required somewhat more than two weeks to complete.

B000059TEQ|5.0|The major reason makes me interest in this book and DVD was my Dad.  This movie <BR>was shot before I was born.  When I was a little girl, I saw Dad watching this movie every time when it was shown on TV.  My Dad is kinds of the action movie type.  I was surprised why he loved watching this movie.  So, when I was in the video store one day, I decided to rent the DVD to see what made my Dad to watch a love drama.  Just like my father.  I am totally devoted to the movie.  I bought both \\"Oliver's Story\\" and \\"Love Story\\" and finished reading in one afternoon.  For me, I like the Love Story more than Oliver's Story.  The 3/4 part of the Love Story was a pleasant story.  Both of them loved each other very much and would like to sacrifice for each other.  For Oliver's story, it's all sad and how Oliver couldn't forget Jenny.   Love Story is very well written.  I highly recommend you to read it.

6304698798|5.0|This is the movie that got me into movies. Great cast, good script (i wish i spoke italian and could hear and understand the original in it's intened form) great soundtrack, especially at the climactic end. the fast cuts to the intense eyes of the three characters in time with music is one of my favorite scenes on film. i love how it's drawn out. some scenes are shot are shot in a 'real-time' if you will. for example the opening scene where the three bounty hunters close in on Tuco and pounce on him in the saloon. Leone takes his time walking up the street. i love the cinematograpy, lee van cleef--awesome--<br />i love it i love it i love it
B000060P79|1.0|Terrible. Utter garbage. Rock is dying. It's pathetic, talentless, high pitched people like this that are kicking rock to a pulp, without letting it up. If you want to kill music, buy this album. These guys HAVE no balls, so it's no wonder why they don't need pads and helmets. Every single song is the same, each one is as predictable as the last. Do your ears a favor and do not purchase this waste of paper and plastic.
B000060P79|4.0|These guys, along with bands like new found glory, and the starting line and good charlotte are getting blasted for being too pop and not enough punk.  liking music is all about just giving it a chance and people who diss these guys simply aren't giving them a chance.  My advice is; open your mind and quit living in the past, ditch your NOFX and Sex Pistols albums and grab this one.
B000001DYJ|5.0|The orininal live KISS album: \\"ALIVE\\", was and is one of the most popular and respected live heavy metal/hard rock albums of the 70's. That's saying a lot, because the 70's where filled with great live albums. In '77, KISS released \\"ALIVE II\\". It was not up to the level of the first one. Then, 16 years later, they put out \\"ALIVE III\\". This is just as good as the first. It is not about the makeup and show, just the music behind the show. It proved that KISS was one of the best bands of classic metal because of their songs, not their costumes. It features the best from KISS's entire career up until '93. A solid live album. If your going to get \\"ALIVE IV\\", don't be upset if it is not as good as this disc.
0312983867|1.0|I got turned onto this series by a friend who sent me 1-7. I read them quickly and anxiously awaited 8...mainly because I wanted to see where Stephanie/Ranger went.<br />This was the best Evanovich could do with them? After the buildup, this was an incredible letdown and affected the rest of the book for me. One would think that at least a couple of pages could've been used on this relationship instead of the wham-bam resolution we got. A horrible effort.<br />And to top it off, the series itself is just starting to get redundant and silly. Enough blowing up cars already -- it was funny in the first book, mildly amusing in the second book, and outright annoying in the third book. Enough with Grandma sticking her nose into everything all the time. Enough with thugs on the balcony. Enough with quirky FTAs who evade capture. It'd be really nice, just once, to see something original in these books.<br />With Evanovich's other new series being so awful, I hope she's invested her money wisely...because if she doesn't start improving soon, I'm betting she can kiss much more income from her writing goodbye.
B00005UEAR|2.0|I think this CD is terrible and a waste of money.  No disrespect to Dream Theater - I think all their previous releases except for 'Falling into Inifnity' are masterpieces.  But I also feel like any TRUE Dream Theater fan who says this is a good release is in denial over the fact that Dream Theater has already reached their peak and is on the decline.  I say take the money you were going to spend on this cd and pick up THE ODYSSEY by Symphony X instead.  That was the cd that made Symphony X by favorite band.  Guess who my old favorite band was?
6300163423|5.0|This is an intriguing, unusual, beautifully directed, highly atmospheric film that successfully crosses any number of genre: film noir, thriller, mystery, and horror.  The plot is simple. In the mid nineteen fifties, a mysterious and slightly sinister business man, Louis Cypher (Robert De Niro), hires Brooklyn gumshoe, Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke), for a missing person case.  Angel's investigation, for which he is being paid a princely sum for the time, takes him from Harlem to New Orleans, as he looks for a former crooner named Johnny Favorite, who sometime during the early nineteen forties apparently welched on a business deal with Louis Cypher and hasn't been heard from since.<br />What happens when Angel gets to New Orleans will be infused with voodoo rites, ritual murders and taboo sex. The Big Easy is hardly that for our erstwhile detective, as he becomes susceptible to a series of initially puzzling flashbacks. Moreover, it seems that everyone with whom he meets, who had a connection to our missing crooner, ends up being savagely murdered. When he meets with a tarot card reader (Charlotte Rampling), it is just the beginning of the end for our increasingly disheveled gumshoe. His introduction to the gorgeous Epiphany (Lisa Bonet), a seventeen year old voodoo queen, later leads to a coupling that is played with singularly wild abandon.  Both of these women have a  connection to our mysterious missing person, Johnny Favorite, who, it turns out, may have given the Devil a run for his money in the evil department.<br />Robert De Niro is sensational in the highly stylized,  role of Louis Cypher. He imbues the role with just the right amount of sardonic humor and restrained menace so as to make the character memorable. De Niro leaves an indelible imprint on every scene in which he is in.  Mickey Rourke, who is in nearly every scene in this film, shows that he has the ability to carry a movie, as he is simply terrific as the private detective who is slowly unraveling. As the film progresses, the toll that the investigation is taking on the tormented Angel is evident on his face. Angst ridden, bleary eyed, and disheveled, Angel is definitely involved in the biggest case of his life. As he gets closer to the truth of what happened to Johnny Favorite, the more his life seems to be spinning out of control. Rourke manages to convey all this, no easy task. The supporting cast is uniformly excellent and adds to the flavor of this delicious gumbo of a film, which is reminiscent of Goethe's Faust. Undoubtedly, this film is one of  Alan Parker's best directorial efforts. Bravo!As the film progresses, the toll that the investigation is taking on the tormented Angel is evident on his face.

B00006L83N|5.0|I have been listening to Dream Theater since 'Images and Words' came out in '92.  I've been listening to Symphony X since their 'Twilight in Olympus' cd was released.  Although I told myself for YEARS that nothing could surpass Dream Theater, THIS CD MADE ME REALIZE THAT SYMPHONY X BLOWS AWAY DREAM THEATER.  I am not kidding.  I think I might have listened to this CD every day since it was released, which at this point in time was about 8 months ago.  This is the cd that also made Symphony X my all time favorite band.<br />I don't even know where to start - Michael Romeo is a genius.  He's a great songwriter and a FLAWLESS guitarist.  He is like a perfect cross between Yngwie Malmsteen, John Petrucci, and Dimebag Darrell.  Everything about his guitar playing is perfect and he knows just when to do certain things in the songs.  It's hard to describe, but he knows when to be subtle.  He is what makes this cd the METAL CLASSIC that I know it will truly live up to be.  <br />This cd is also way heavier than all the previous Symphony X releases, although does not diminish the value of the other releases.  And it's not just the heaviness - but its the tremolo bar action, legato, vibrato, chord drama, sweep picking, and just a JUGGERNAUT of EXTREME MUSICAL INDULGENCE.  A lot less keyboards than the previous releases, but I think this is a good thing.  <br />I also think 'V' is a weak release by this band with a lot of 'empty spaces' in the songs - which I think is the total opposite on ODYSSEY, in retrospect.  Hey, I could go on and on for days and tell you why this cd is just the best, but find out for yourself, and buy the cd!
B00008OLYN|5.0|i heard this record from a buddy of mine in school. once i pressed play, i could not stop listening to this amazing work of art. the mixture of piano, acoustic guitar and amazing vocals made this band my most favorite aside of metallica. the songs are as melodic as you can get and the guitar and vocals make this a must have for anyone who want to hear something new and completley different from normal satan worshiping, growling, un-tuned guitar ,so fast you cant distinguish the guitar from the drums death metal, which in my opinion is a sorry excuse for music and should not be considered music at all. i am a new fan of Opeth and i will continue to love their music for as long as they keep making music. the songs \\"windowpane\\" and \\"death whispered a lullaby\\" completely blew me away. i STRONGLY suggest that you all go out and get all of Opeth's stuff and hope that you enjoy it as much as i have. trust me.....you wont be sorry.
B000059XYM|1.0|All I can say is that this movie is just another typical Wayans movie.  If U really enjoy raunchy, crude behavior this movie is filled with it and U would enjoy from beginning 2 end.
B000092Q7O|4.0|I purchased this DVD without first seeing the movie in theaters, and I knew from the reviews I read I wouldn't be disappointed.  This is a classic masterpiece of one man's struggle against the inhumanity of the Nazis of world war II Germany.  Adrien Brody's portrayal of Polish pianist Wladislaw Szpilman is both beautiful and nuanced.  Nothing overdone.  Although I wouldn't rank this as high as Schindler's List (as some have done), it's definitely one of the finest of the Holocaust movies ever made.
B000002H6C|5.0|This one seriously kicks...! They are at their musical best at this point (in my opinion). Although they aren't as fast as the first three albums, being fast and heavy is not a synonym for musically good. The almost 10-minute title track is never boring and is one of my favorite Metallica songs of all time. Longer songs are better! Also there is One, an awesome song about a soldier.
031286504X|5.0|I finished the book in two nights, its fairly short, but it is simply amazing, and then  i found out it was written in the 50's, and that made it pure genius.  I cannot believe Matheson could write something like this that long ago, it is one of the, if not the best books ever written, i suggest everyone reading this book.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead does not fail to dissapoint.  Their new album is also very melodic at times.  It begins with &quot;2+2=5&quot;, a song which is almost a return to their Ok, Computer style.  but it's follwed up with &quot;Sit down. Stand up.&quot;  With layers upon laters of rich music and Thom Yorke's voice.  The album sways between experimental and guitar driven.<br />My personal favorites are &quot;Backdrifts&quot;, &quot;There there&quot;, and &quot;A Punchup at a Wedding&quot; (love the piano done on this track).
B00008PX8P|5.0|...Led Zep harkens back to the golden age of rock - the 70's.  They were my first favorite band, right when the broke up, in 1980.  This DVD is evidence what I, and others, missed out on.  The DVD is a bargain, and has alot of material to watch and be amazed.  The set goes from their electric blues beginnings at the 1970 Royal Albert Hall concert to their swan song at 1979's Knebworth festival. The restoration of the material is a marvel, and while not perfect, most of the material is quite old and that needs to be recognized when evaluating it.  Given the age, the picture quality is excellent.  Its not quite as good as Queen's DVD \\"We Will Rock You\\" but nothing is ever perfect.  On the other hand, the sound quality is ridiculously amazing and as good as any music DVD I've ever heard.  If you don't have a 5.1 decoder or receiver, you're missing out.  These DVD's (except for the extras) are in 5.1 DTS or Dolby Digital (I use the DTS) and bring the music to another level.  Though most of the surround action is for ambience, reverb and the occasional echo or pan effect, it still gives one that \\"you are there\\" feeling.  The bass is huge and in your face. I can't wait until the re-release the album catalog in SACD or DVD-A, as its tailor-made for those formats. <br />If one is picky, you can ask why is there 4 \\"Dazed and Confused\\" and \\"Communication Breakdown\\" versions on Disc I?  Why is some of the material from the movie Song Remains the Same on Disc II (despite its improvement in quality)?  Where is \\"Down on the Tiles\\", \\"No Quarter\\", \\"Good Times Bad Times\\" or \\"When the Levee Breaks\\"? Beggers can't be choosers though.<br />However, easily this is the best the band has offered thus far, and possibly ever.  The DVD shows the band continuously transforming over the years as shown in the footage, and they also age (if not quite gracefully).  You can definitely see signs of road-weariness and substance-abuse.  But that is what it was like back then.  If one does not like this legendary band, then don't criticize them or this DVD and go listen to talentless [music] that has ruined the music scene and young kids' tastes, dress attire and attitudes.
B000002VDW|3.0|This album was released after the very sucessful YEAR OF THE CAT. Some good stuff here, but not as engaging as YEAR OF THE CAT. It's been said that SONG ON THE RADIO was written specifically to get radio airplay, yet it's still a good tune. Other highlights: VALENTINA WAY (has a great driving beat) and the Title tract, TIME PASSAGES (sort of an ode to nostalgia) are really good. The rest is good story telling, but not much Rockin-n-rollin'. If you like songs that give you the feel for the story they're telling, this is for you!!!
B000092ZYX|5.0|Wow...I have not been able to put this CD down for two weeks.  I loved OK computer and the bends.  I enjoyed Kid A and Amnesiac.  This CD is better than I imagined.  The songs are so dynamic, changing timings, and shifting all over the place.  Listen the the time count on We suck young blood.  Guitar, snare, piano, clap, Guitar, snaree, piano, clap,......  These guys are genious.
B00008PX8P|5.0|My kids (daughter 13, son 16) decided to get me a Father's Day present. Guess what it was? The brand new Led Zeppelin DVD.  My initial reaction was amusement.  It was reminiscent of  Homer Simpson buying Marge a bowling ball for her birthday (so he could use it). It seems that my son has recently gotten way into them, so it was his idea to reward me with the DVD(so he can watch it).<br />It never fails. Every male gets into Zep as soon as he turns 16. Bingo! Bonzo! Rite of passage and all that. I found myself quietly snickering at the way he presented the DVD to me with such evangelical fervor. As for me, having lived through them when they were still hammering, I'd gotten to the point of being sick of them (courtesy of non-stop classic rock radio fifteen years hence).<br />And anyway, I was always sort of a casual observer. Don't get me wrong; I like a lot of their stuff, but was never a fanatic (\\"Stairway to Heaven\\" can cause me to vomit in the most projectile of ways). But then my son recommended I pop disc 2. As soon as the clip for \\"Immigrant Song\\" hit the screen, I began to feel myself getting blown...AWAY. What an amazing DVD. What a great band. Zep were always stingy with their video image, and now we're treated to a whole new dimension: Page's crazy jumpsuits and demonic bow-screeching across the guitar, Plant's swaggering here's-my-package stage moves, Bonham's bombastic yet articulate drumming, and the amazing invisible Jones.<br />Five hours of live concert stuff? Goodness gracious. I particularly enjoyed the clips from Madison Square Garden in '73. I was a junior in high school that year; That's when I should have copped tickets to see them. All my friends went, but I didn't. Now I understand why they came back to school on Monday with that \\"look\\" in their eyes.<br />Watching this DVD and letting Zep drip all over me, I find myself wanting to fire up a joint and wash it down with some good ol' Boone's Farm Apple Wine, just like the old days. But I won't, because the Knebworth concert features \\"Stairway,\\" and uh...that could be disastrous for me (and my couch).<br />And what exactly did YOUR kids get you for Father's Day?t, because the Knebworth concert features \\"Stairway,\\" and uh...that could be disastrous for me (and my couch).<br />And what exactly did YOUR kids get you for Father's Day?
0385504209|5.0|Dan Brown has done an impressive job researching the material for the book.  He perfectly merges his own story with some of history's most fascinating and yet little known facts: secret societies such as Priory of Sion, symbolism in art, history of paganism, architectural descriptions of museums and churches; everything for an art or history buff's delight.<br />Many fiction books turn into magnificent dust collectors once read.  Somehow, few books convey the unique style of entertaining and teaching, simultaneously, and I must say this one could be among the best.  &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is a real suspense page-turner that you would most likely go back to again and again for reference.  I'm having some trouble deciding where in my library I should shelve the book.  I wonder if the folks at the Lib. of Cong. have developed a special classification for a fiction-reference book =)  Well done, Mr. Brown!
0156027321|3.0|This review will probably only apply to you if you, like me, are very content and assured that God does not exist.  If you belive in, or even give some credence theories of spirituality, no doubt you will be completlely enraptured by this book.  But if you share my feelings as a 'devout' atheist...this is your warning in regards to \\"Life of Pi\\"<br />Upon glossing over many glowing reviews of this book I eagerly read it, trying to keep an open mind.  I thought that perhaps, at best, this book would help explain to me how so many people belived in the unseen.....it did not.<br />This book was deflatingly bad right off the bat.  I could not relate at all to Pi's struggles to identify with a religious group.  This is because the book did a poor and cursory job of explaining WHY he belived in God at all.  It was taken as a given that everyone does, and that Pi was just searching for the right version. Also, unless you are interested in zoology, there are about 10 pages that are mindnumbingly boring and almost unrealated to the rest of the book.<br />2 1/2 of the 3 stars I gave this book came from the survival story, which is the bulk of the novel.  It is well written and I thought well-paced.  It is like many other survival stories written (\\"Hatchet\\" came to mind though it's been awhile) but none the less...it's good reading.<br />It would be unfair to divulge the end, but suffice to say it's interesting, but I would not describe it as profound.  Anyone reading this book who has the slightest notion of science at all will not be overly surprised by the ending, which many more religious people have described as stunning and poignant.  Without that aspect it seems like a fable with no moral...something missing at the end.<br />For this book to work, you have to be spiritual, and read one extra level into it.  If you don't belive in that sort of thing, it's just a good survival read, with a terrible beginning.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead delivers a very strong set of songs here, many of which rank among their best compositions.  The musical styles explored here are someting of a fusion of their old, guitar-based sound and their later, more experimental work.  \\"2+2=5,\\" \\"go to sleep,\\" \\"there there,\\" and  \\"scatterbrain\\" are absolute masterpieces. The rest of the album is pretty damn good too, with one glaring exception: \\"the gloaming.\\"  <BR>\\"The gloaming\\"  is, in my opinion, the worst song of radiohead's entire career, including the mediocre pablo honey fare.   The electronics that comprise the backing track are fairly interesting at first, but the song doesn't go anywhere--it just sort of meanders along in low gear like jandek. Thom's vocals, normally one of the most important and impressive elements of a radiohead song, are dull and repetitive to the point of being classified as an official wank-drone.   <BR>Don't let this one horrible track dissuade you from buying the album--this is epic, brilliant music.  I just can't figure out what drove the band to include that godawful track on the album, much less use it as the alternate title. Still though, i encourage you to buy this album if you like any of the band's other work.
6304698623|5.0|In my opinion, the 1995 film &quot;A Little Princess&quot; is the best family film ever made, along with the 1993 &quot;Secret Garden&quot;. This is also better than the 1939 Shirley Temple film version. The cinematography and musical score are on par with &quot;Secret Garden&quot;. Liesel Matthews gives one of the absolute best child performances in film history as Sara Crewe. She looks very striking and attractive, and her voice is so soothing and natural. My favorite scene is the snow dance in the middle of the film. It reminds me of Winona Ryder in the ice dance scene in &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot;. The plot of the film kind of closely resembles &quot;An American Tail&quot;, but it's somehow much better. If you parents out there are looking for a film for your kids, rent this one.
0716703440|5.0|If you look very carefully, you can see gravitational lensing effects round the edge of this book, and it does tend to suck in all objects within a ten meter radius and compact them down to a singularity, but I have to say that in my time dabbling in it I haven't once opened it on a page where I didn't learn something new and/or gain a new insight. This is the first time, for example, that I've found a book this accessible which gives a PHYSICAL description of what a tensor actually is. Most of the other material I've read just describes transformation properties, which to be honest, when all's said and done, is of precisely no use whatsoever if you want to actually understand the topic, especially in a physics book, which, afterall, is supposed to describe physics (AHEM AH*d'Inverno'*EM). And as if that's not enough for you, it's well illustrated, it's written in some weird style with lots of exclamation marks and it's got a bunch of historical facts and quotes thrown in on the side. Read this, plus a book on gut bacteria, and you'll never run out of conversation at parties ever again.
6305784116|3.0|Baloo was such a huge Disney character, so taking Baloo's voice (Phil Harris) and putting it in the alley cat O'malley doesn't work; unless you've never seen &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;.  Dutchess, voiced by Gza Gza Gabor, is such a dull character; and as cute as the three kittens are, they come nowhere near to saving this movie.  The plot has nothing to keep the audience interested.  It's been said before:  A butler who has given his service for so many years, gets passed up in the will for a familly of Aristocats.  Never has a Disney movie made you feel so sorry for the bad guy.  This film just doesn't work, and I'm glad I didn't buy it.  However I gave it three stars because it is a child's film, and I must look from a child's perspective.

It's a long, sometimes exasperating, book on the subject of animation; I'd advise the reader to take their time with this one, and perhaps skip the really technical stuff that may be too much for the average reader.<BR>Whats really inspiring is the dedication all the young artists showed in exploring this new medium, and how Walt Disney's amazing gifts as a leader, visionary, and storyteller kept the \\"Disney Train\\" surging ahead even after Disney's death in 1966.

B00008NEQM|4.0|The music of ERA continues to be enjoyable among the fans of the genera however, it seems a little repetitive of their earlier CDs (and it doesn't help to have couple of tracks re-orchestrated from the first CD).
0783226063|3.0|As much as I hate to disagree with Amazon.com's review of the DVD release of DUNE, it is not the original theatrical release. I was in the theater when it premiered in my hometown. I, my young son, my mother, my father and my brother were all there and can tell you that 137 is not the whole flick. The first intermission was at 90 minutes. What's the point of that for another stinking 45? No, the original was about 3 hours long and the only complaint I had was seeing the Irulan Chronicles delivered by Jose Ferrer, Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV. Irulan wrote the Chronicles while she was married to Paul and should have delivered them in the movie. When the Video version came out, I couldn't believe they got the whole thing on one tape. Even Ben Hur used two tapes and half of that is music and intermission.<br />Well, as I feared, they did not get it all on one tape. They chopped it up and spit out this watered down version with only one notable improvement: Irulan delivers the opening Chronicle. As soon as I saw her face on the screen I knew this was not the movie I paid money to see back in 1984. Therefore, be forewarned that what you are buying in both the DVD and Video Tape is a severely condensed version of an exceptionally well-crafted film of a Pulitzer Prize winning novel and not the full meal deal. Frank Herbert was consulted on the making of the original movie, and if you could see the rest of the movie, you'd know why the Barron is covered with festering boils, what the heart plugs are about, and all of the other out-takes that this version deemed unnecessary.
B00001ODGR|4.0|If you're a Styx fan you will love this DVD.  The band (minus Chuck Panozzo, the drummer, who died just prior to this 1996 tour) is very tight, and they obviously enjoy their Chicago reunion.  Their newdrummer, Todd Sucherman, fits, and really adds to the energy.  Most of Styx's major hits are here (Rockin' The Paradise, Blue Collar Man, Lady, Too Much Time On My Hands, Snowblind, Suite Madame Blue, Crystal Ball, Grand Illusion, Fooling Yourself, Show Me The Way, Boat On The River, Lorelei, Babe, Miss America, Come Sail Away, Renegade, and The Best of Times), with one glaring omission from my standpoint - Mr. Roboto.  Most of the songs were very well done, with Come Sail Away being truly awesome.<br />Styx as usual puts on a great show.  John Panozzo, the bassist is far more active and engaged then I ever remember in the shows I saw.  The only problem with the sound concerned the volume on James Young's leads.  In some (but not all) settings on my receiver (Denon 3802 - Widescreen and Jazz Room settings) his leads are very quiet.  This was especially bothersome, as one of the greatest things about Styx involve the contrasting guitar styles of James Young and Tommy Shaw. Additionally, while James Young's leads absolutely rocked, a few of Tommy's do not fit as well as they could have (although his acoustic work was awesome!).  Also, Dennis DeYoung's black hair color is somewhat strange.  <br />These are minor quibbles though.  Their voices are all terrific, and the performance is wonderful. If you have ever seen their live performances, you know this is where Styx truly shines.  This DVD reminds us how great they really were.
B00005JLPK|5.0|Salma Hayek's Oscar worthy performance made &quot;Frida&quot; that much enjoyable to watch!  The heart and soul that went into making this movie paid off once released.  One would be crazy not to feel the raw emotions that Frida is feeling during every scene.  One may find it hard to believe that the real Frida Kahlo lived this movie.  The make up artist was very accurate with Hayek's appearance compared to the Kahlo's paintings(they used her real ones).  See it, and if you agree with me, buy it and keep in your movie collection for as long as you live.  This will be a classic.
B000001G16|5.0|Rest In Peace - Slightly uneasy start to the record, has you anticipating bad things.<BR>Church of Desire - Any illusions of this being a bad record are thrown completely out of the window. This is a seriously good song. I've owner the record for three years, and I still listen to this one on a regular basis.<BR>Stranger in this Town - Perfectly captures the feeling of loneliness. A strangely beautiful track.<BR>Ballad of Youth - It's amazing how a song like this can get through to a teenager. It's anthemic with some seriously good guitar licks.<BR>One Light Burning - One of my least favourite tracks, but if it was on any other album, it would be the best on it. Even at his worst, Sambora is better than almost anyone else.<BR>Mr. Bluesman - Absolutely astounding, blues song, and Eric Clapton's guitar solo just makes it even more amazing.<BR>Rosie - The most Bon Jovi-reminiscent track on the album. Jon actually wanted this for New Jersey, but Richie kept it.<BR>River of Love - Dodgy lyrics, but another nice, anthemic rock song.<BR>Father Time - Sharply contrasting to the previous two tracks, it really hits you with despair and angst.<BR>The Answer - A beautiful ending to a beautiful album. Soft, gentle, but with a strange power about it.<br />Jon may be the focus of Bon Jovi, but with this album, Richie really steps out of the shadows and proves himself a superior vocalist, songwriter, and a truly amazing guitarist.
B000003TAW|5.0|Weezer is by far the best i have ever heard. They have been my favorite band for most of my life. I own all of their albums so far except the album called &quot;The Lion and the Witch&quot; mostly because its just a collection of some songs from there albums. Weezer is truly unique and no band could ever get close to competing with them. All of their song are each unique in everyone of their albums including this one. Weezer is the best thing to happen to music since music itself. For the people who are reading this review, stop hesitating and buy all of their albums to date!
B00008H2LB|3.0|i  thought that the cd was okay. For a person that is not used to listening to rock it was okay. There were a few songs that i did like.  The first one was #2 Don't Stay because of the fast pace and the lyrics. The second song was #3 Somewhere I Belong becasue it sounds like something the average teenager can relate to. Number 7 Faint just because no particular reason. Figure 09 because of the lyrics and the music.  Nobody's Listening and Numb were the other two songs that I liked on the album.
B00005R62K|5.0|Absolute, dark, stunning, gorgeous, pulchritudinous piece of metal history!  If you don't have it already, I highly suggest you get it!
B00005KHJV|3.0|Here's another reason to get annoyed with the way they release movies on tape and DVD.  How many versions of Halloween will they keep coming out with?<br />This movie has one thing going for it: the 10 extra minutes of footage.  The material was shot in 81 while they were shooting Halloween II because they needed extra footage for the TV version which was cut under time.  So they wove a plot twist--the Michael Meyers/Laurie Strode sibling relation between them which is actually key to the neverending legacy of the series.<br />And that's it.  Wasn't this material already included on the limited Halloween DVD?  And why don't they just put all this stuff on one disc--it's 10 extra minutes.<br />Not worth it.  There's a scene of Loomis pleading with the medical board to keep Michael Meyer's in maximum security.  Then the shot of the hospital room with the word \\"sister\\" written on the wall.  Buy the theatrical edition with the documentary and the better sound mixes.
0060920084|4.0|Hit the road with Bryson and you can never be at a loss for things to complain about, to make fun of, and sometimes to take seriously.  Here I am reading this in 2003 and I find many things a little outdated but informative and entertaining nonetheless.  For example, Bryson travels to Yellowstone National Park less than a year before it was hit by its most ferocious fire in recent history (1988).  He tunes in to Jimmy Swaggart feeling remorse for his transgressions with tears endlessly rolling down his cheeks.<br />Bryson can get a little annoying at times when you think he is most probably just making up names of people and places.  Making fun of people's accents can be tiresome at times.  Just to keep his reader engrossed, he imbues his narrative with digressions about his family, his relatives, and his fantasies, which is another way of emphasizing how tedious driving across large swaths of land in some parts of the country can be.  The change of attitude from detesting his home state to finding it as the best place it can be at the end of his road trip was comforting.<br />As a traveler, Bryson is hard to categorize.  He is definitely not a typical tourist as he detests tourist traps, theme parks, and overpriced historical and quasi-historical landmarks.  He does not seem to be an &quot;outdoorsy&quot; person, for even if he makes diversions to national parks, as opposed to passing by and not stopping, there is hardly any mention of day hikes.  This, however, can be explained by the off-season timing of his trips to most of the national parks, especially in the West.  He revels in taking side roads and byways to check out both natural and historical destinations, and does not mind pushing more miles (40-70 miles) just to find a reasonable place to stay, to dine, or to have a big breakfast.  His sense of place is strong, perhaps owing to what he referred to as the Midwesterner's bent for knowing their geographical directions given the topographical monotony of their region.<br />A map of the 48 states, or a composite showing his fall trip to the eastern half and his spring trip to the western half of the country would have been helpful in guiding people through his personal road trip.<br />I am partial to the western part of the United States in terms of  desirable travel destinations, and I did look forward to the beginning of his western journey starting with Colorado and New Mexico.  I was therefore offended by his remark on the profusion of Spanish place names, where an attitude smacked of ugly Americanism, a trait that did not seem to have been diluted after two decades of living in Britain.  Here's an excerpt from page 272: &quot;...so that every place in the Southwest is called San this or Santa that.  Driving across the Southwest is like an 800-mile religious procession.  The worst name on the whole continent is the Sangre de Cristo Mountains...have you ever heard of a more inane name for any geographical feature?&quot;  I guess it takes an upbringing in a Spanish-infused culture to gain an appreciation for Spanish nomenclature.  If anything, the names are melodious, it not vividly descriptive.  What to say of &quot;Sierra Nevada&quot; (snowy mountains)?  Or &quot;La Sal Mountains&quot; (salt mountains) in southeastern Utah?  Bryson would have thought that ridiculous, when the Spanish explorers, in the middle of red-rock desert, thought they were seeing salt instead of snow on the mountain crests!  &quot;Sangre de Cristo&quot; (blood of Christ) is a powerful description for the color of the mountains at dusk.  Is the inaneness, according to our dear author, because of the morbid nature of the description???  These Spanish names are beautiful, and they testify to the permanent hold Spanish exploration has on this huge geographical area of the country.<br />The names given by the Spanish, in my opinion, are more imaginative and descriptive than some of the English names such as &quot;Collegiate Peaks&quot; (Colorado),&quot;Green Mountains&quot; (Vermont), &quot;White Mountains&quot; (New Hampshire, California, and Arizona), &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; and &quot;Smoky Mountains&quot;., &quot;Green Mountains&quot; (Vermont), &quot;White Mountains&quot; (New Hampshire, California, and Arizona), &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; and &quot;Smoky Mountains&quot;.
6305508550|5.0|Proving he has more than Beavis and Butthead up his sleeve Mike Judge wrote and directed this gem of a comedy about the dead-end world of a cubicle slave in a faceless corporation.  Ron Livingston is Peter, one such cube dweller at Initech, a corporation we never learn much about (I think they develop banking software).  It's not important, of course, because Initech looks and feels like so many offices in so many industries all across America.  Bored to tears at his job Peter undergoes hypnosis at a therapist and suddenly snapping out of his routine, breaking up with his corporate girlfriend.  He goes into a peaceful, carefree sort of trance where he coasts through work until two \\"consultants\\" (who signal the coming of layoffs) determine he's just not being challenged enough at work.  Meanwhile, Peter's more productive friends are cut away on recommendation of their slimy manager, Bill Lumbergh, played by Gary Cole with such nauseating, weasle-like smarminess that you've seen less talented people get Oscars for smaller roles.  The trio of friends, tired of being the little guys, hatch a scheme to funnell money slowly and secretly from Initech.  Meanwhile, a neurotic coworker slowly cracks as his desk is moved farther and farther away from everyone else...<br />Office Space is a must for anyone who has ever worked in an office.  Sat at a cubicle.  Wanted to take a fax machine into an open field and beat it with a bat while blasting Ice Cube.  It captures American corporate microculture perfectly, laughing in the face of being micromanaged to death.  But it touches on unversal elements and the laughs are steady, captured in the details like the boss everyone hates, or rap music in suburbia.  A shame this got such a small theatrical release; it found a nice following on tape and DVD.<br />Here's a small, low budget film delivering laughs and some wicked humor.  This is Mike Judge directing but it's not Beavis and Butthead by a longshot.  Highly recommended.
B00003CXXM|5.0|I was never a big Matt Damon fan, at least until I saw this film. Watching \\"The Bourne Identity\\" was an unexpectedly enjoyable experience. Matt Damon, as reluctant assassin Jason Bourne, is my dream bodyguard: ripped, cute, tough but sensitive. German actress Franka Potente is in perfect counterpoint with Damon: she plays her character Marie with just the perfect combination of moxie and vulnerability. I thoroughly enjoyed the fight scenes in this film, which showcases the obscure Filipino martial art, Kali. Kali's style is far from showy. It's movements are spare and to the point, devoid of the sweeping arm movements and posturing so ubiquitous in today's standard issue fight scenes. And Damon makes it look so effectively brutal, other martial arts almost look effeminate in comparison. Some aspects of the movie are a bit too \\"Hollywood\\" to be plausible, like Jason and Marie's insistence on using that very conspicuous, shocking red bag from the Swiss bank, but over all, I would still recommend this DVD.
B00008MNYS|3.0|Robbie Williams is an entertainer. As another reviewer noted, he's not an artist but he definitely can spin the emotions, from ecstatic rock-out anthems like &quot;Let Me Entertain You&quot;,  heart-wrenching ballads like &quot;Angel&quot;, and adrenalin engines like &quot;Rock DJ&quot;, all of which are from prior albums.<br />&quot;Escapology&quot;, on the other hand, comes nowhere near any of these achievements. As usual, the melodies are good but that's their limit. They're not particularly memorable and the production -- which seems to focus on guitar rock pretty much exclusively, much to the album's detriment -- is derivative and uninspired.<br />Robbie and Guy Chambers have done better, and have had more interesting ideas.  &quot;Swing When You're Winning&quot; was fantastic (despite the fact that Sinead O'Connor's take on old standards -- &quot;Am I Not Your Girl?&quot; -- is head and shoulders above it) and Robbie's other discs do achieve more than &quot;Escapology&quot; ever seems to aspire to. I fear that Robbie's been on a decline since the height of the Knebworth concert and his multi-million record deal, which is forcing him to address American tastes more and more.<br />This is not the best showcase of the best of Robbie Williams.  For that, look (in the US) to &quot;The Ego Has Landed&quot; or &quot;Sing When You're Winning&quot;.  But don't ignore him.  He's the best entertainer Britain has produced in years, and he deserves your attention.
0800187792|5.0|FINALLY, and inspiring movie for girls with substance!  A great TRUE story, great cast, and wonderfully photographed.  I highly recommend it for girls (and families) of all ages.
B00005JKHP|5.0|I think any star trek fan( the real ones ) and not just self ordained critics would rate this film exceptional and it brought back to trekkers and trekkies , a bridge from the old series to the future showings of star trek movies to come. I thought this was a great movie and was not boring, I would not be a person to be so introspective into something as to not enjoy the movie at hand. I look forward to watching star trek till the end of my days.
B00004T8RK|2.0|Pearl Jam died, and this was the nail in the coffin.  Gone are the furious beats of Vs, the melodic enchant of Ten, and the pure grunge soul of Vitalogy.  All I hear is a weak, tired band that has run out of fuel.
B000002IRL|5.0|This has too be Overkill's best Album to date (aside from The Years Of Decay) I couldn't even label anything wrong with this CD even if i tried, Every track on this CD is Ace, from beginning to end, this has all your needs from fast songs \\"Blood Money\\" & \\"Thanx For Nothing\\", Nicely tuned songs \\"Live Young, Die Free\\" & \\"Infectious\\" to slow melow songs such as \\"Horrorscope\\" & \\"Nice Day...For A Funeral\\", this has it all, and all is very, very good.<br />So weither you your new too Overkill, like their old stuff or new stuff, considering listening to Overkill. GET THIS CD! trust me, you'll be hooked, after this and \\"The Years Of Decay\\" i sure was.
B000005YZM|5.0|I never get tired of listening to this Zombies Classic. It is as summery and beautiful as anything the Beach Boys ever recorded. In my imaginary world, I like thinking of this as the great lost follow-up to Pet Sounds. Its like imagining Badfinger as the continuation of the Beatles. There is one throw away song and that is Butcher's Tale. I skip it every time but the rest has a gorgeous flow and comes to one of the greatest last songs ever- Time Of The Season. It is very sad that they ended the group here. There was a serious lack of appreciation for them at the time, but at least they left us a gem and one would be wise to discover it sometime in their life if they love the Beach Boys, the Beatles, and Sixties Psychedelia in general.
B00005JLET|5.0|Typically I don't really enjoy animated films, but this one was awesome!  It kept my attention and was really a unique movie.  I couldn't even guess what was going to happen next.    This is a must-see for both adults and kids.  It does have some very scary scenes for young kids (my 3 year old was scared a few times and wanted me to turn it off) so I would definitely recommend adult supervision while watching.
B00006F7S4|5.0|This album is simply Beautiful and I really have to wonder what someone is thinking when they think of it as Dull. If you want to go bang your head, then Beck is not for you in the first place. However, if you want thought provoking music about sadness, break-up, heartache and all the real human emotions that people who have a pulse experience, then Beck is an artist of our generation. This guy can do anything and this album proves it. Highlights:The Golden Age, Paper Tiger, Already Dead, Little One, and End Of The Day. Fantastic!
B00000DOY9|5.0|Ya know...A LOT  of people knocked this album(prog rock krap)I totally disagree.I feel this album rocks big time.I consider this zeps final hurrah!!!!!
B000092ZYY|5.0|I have loved radiohead since the early nineties when Pablo Honey was released, and i have been with them ever since. Hail to the Theif is absolutly brilliant (like everything radiohead), and despite the claim that it is the &quot;return of the guitars&quot;, radiohead still spices up the tracks with some Amnesiac/ Kid A-esque pops, clicks and squeels, which just drive me mad with radiohead lust! Hail the theif marks for radiohead a middle ground between albums like the Bends and Kid A, it is a fully realized vison of the two. Thom Yorke's powerful voice and lyrical skill are stunning. <BR>I waited until midnight for its release and went home imeadiatly, memorizing the words the very same day i bought it!<BR>Though the whole album is smashing, some of the stand out tracks are:<br />2+2=5, &quot;because you have not been paying attention!&quot;<BR>Sit Down, Stand Up, &quot;the Raindrops...!&quot;<BR>Backdrifts, &quot;I will eat you alive.&quot;<BR>There There, &quot;theres always a siren singing you to shipwreck&quot;<BR>I Will, &quot;I won't let this happen to my children.&quot;<BR>A Punch Up at a Wedding, &quot;Hypocrite, oppertunist!&quot;<BR>Mysomatosis, &quot;i don't know why i feel so tounge tied&quot;<BR>and finally...<BR>A Wolf at the Door, &quot;Get the flan in the face&quot;<br />So what i am trying to say is buy this CD, actually by enought to send to everyone you know.<br />Cheers!
B000003C5C|5.0|Death's \\"Leprosy\\" is one of the standards by which all death/thrash discs are judged.  Every heavy band since Death pretty can only hope to write songs this good.<br />Leprosy is metal in it's purest form. Leprosy is pure aggression. Leprosy is flat-out excellent song-writing. Huh? Song-writing mentioned in a death metal review? That's right, these songs are catchy. The vocals lines have almost a hypnotic, sing-along quality over the rhythms. Leprosy is by far Death's best disc, and one of the best Death Metal discs ever recorded.<br />Other late 80's/early 90's thrash records that are worth a look are: Sepultura - \\"Beneath the Remains\\" and \\"Arise\\", Napalm Death - \\"Harmony Corruption\\", Pestilence - \\"Consuming Impulse\\", and Stormtroopers of Death - \\"Speak English or Die\\".
B00004Z459|5.0|I am so tired of people bad mouthing Linkin Park. They are so dam talented. I agree they aren't death metal, but that doesn't mean they aren't talented. Linkin Park themselves do not call them selves death metal, so stop being brainwashed by the media. Linkin park is so cool and so humble and I love them.
B000000H40|3.0|Obituary was one of the first big death metal bands. Looking back on this record today it is still pretty good. My only gripe is that the vocals are too loud in the mix. So they get a bit annoying at times. Besides this one, no other Obituary records are worth buying IMHO.
B00005JL3A|4.0|Interesting movie - pretty good action and story.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|At first, I expected a traditional Fleetwood Mac CD.  When it wasn't, I kind of pout it away for awhile thinking it was just not that good, and maybe a little weird.  Then, I went to see Mac at the MCI in DC.  The concert was one of the best I had ever seen.  The songs that I thought had seemed so weird at first were great.  I agree this could be almost classified as a Lindsey Buckingham CD, but it works.  Murrow Turning Over In His Grave was one song I especially hated at first.  But my first listen was on a cheap 59 dollar CD player in the shop at work.  The song rocked in concert.  Afterwards, I pulled it out again and threw it on in my car.  This CD kicks...  You just have to be able to HEAR it all.  Highly recommended.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Moving forwards while looking back - it's hard to do.  Try doing it while driving a car for a while.  But Radiohead have done it here, with seeming ease.  This is NOT OK Computer, nor Kid A, nor The Bends.  It is its own beast, taking samples from the best of the past and moving forwards into uncharted territory.  Radiohead albums are always confusing at first because it's something we've never quite heard before.  And so it goes here.<br />The middle of the album is quiet, meditative.  This has been a complaint among some, but I think that you have to look here to see what is coming in the future from this band.  More rhythm, less melody, and Thom's voice which sails over all.  I've never heard Thom sound this good.  <br />And I have to say, I LOVE &quot;A Punch-up at a Wedding.&quot;  Radiohead songs can transport you into environments with incredible ease, and this song makes me want to laugh every time.  I can see the men in tuxedos, the bridesmaids bickering and pulling hair, the wedding cake being scooped up in handfuls and thrown in people's faces.  Just spectacular.  Radiohead has done it again, and the pressure's already on for the next album.
B00006IRJU|5.0|First of all the tracks on this cd are simply unique. The title of the album is simply a reminder of one of the most head-catchy songs of icehouse's you will ever locate (Man Of Colors) and as for the likes of 'Sunrise' and a few of the other important songs on here you will not be disappointed. I have listened to many of the other complilations of Icehouse's individualised cds and they all lack the geniune need for including some really head-catchy music that remains in the brain-cells for days. Well believe me you will find the through taste of music on this album irresistable so if you are a Icehouse fan looking for music and you have just happened to come here to amazon from any remote location (i.e. even antarctica); throw this one on your shopping basket and get it delivered to your frontdoor instantaneously within 24-caret gold protective gladwrap - you will not regret paying the extra dollars to get it delivered ;-) - trust me...
B00005RFAI|2.0|From \\"Just Like a Pill\\" to \\"Get the Party Started\\" Pink shows that she's a punk. (Or at least she thinks she is) Although, Pink's first C.D was awesome, this one is a waste of money. Pink thinks she's \\"all that\\" by tatoos and black hair, but when it comes to singing, she is definetley not all that. My favorite song on the C.D is \\"Respect\\" cuzit has a nice beat, all the other songs are full of loudness. Especially Misery. With the title, you'd think it's a great soft and full of misery song but with Steven Tyler's voice in it, how can it be that? It's pretty sad if there's only one good song on the C.D. Well, all I can say is, better luck on your next C.D Pink. (Leave out the punk images)
B000002KXO|5.0|I would say most Fleetwood Mac fans deem 'Tusk' as the best Fleetwood Mac album ever created. There's no doubt that 'Tusk' was hauntingly beautiful and quite different from anything created before it.  I do think that some of Fleetwood Mac's best material resides on that album,  'Storms' for instance is amazingly beautiful.<br />  All of that said however, there's something about Mirage that really seems to move me more.  There's something about this album that is almost magical to me.  I really love Lindsey's songs on this album,  'Book of Love' is by far one of my favorite Lindsey Buckingham creations.  'Eyes of the World' with the awesome harmonized guitar lines, 'Oh Diane', 'Can't Go Back' ah all very cool Lindsey stuff. :)<br />  'Only Over You' &amp; 'Wish You Were Here' are very moving as well ... I really miss Christine being around, she added a really wonderful melodic sense to the band.<br />  Anyway .. 'Mirage' is an awesome album, to all of those who are yet to hear it, give it a listen,  I think you'll love it as well.
0385504209|3.0|I WAS ABSOLUTELY HOOKED ON THIS BOOK FOR THE FIRST HALF.  I THOUGHT THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE SECRET SOCIETIES, THE GRAIL, MASONS, ETC. WAS EXTREMELY INTERESTING.  SOMEWHERE IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE BOOK, I BECAME PUZZLED, CONFUSED AND ULTIMATELY LET DOWN.  THE PLOT WOUND DOWN TO A SOMETHING SILLY AND CONTRIVED.  THE CHARACTERS WERE NEVER FULLY DEVELOPED SO I FELT NOTHING FOR THEM.  IF SOMEONE ASKED ME TODAY, 5 MONTHS AFTER READING IT, HOW DID IT END?  I COULDN'T TELL THEM.<br />STRONG START, BELLY FLOP ENDING.
B00000IQC8|5.0|Clerks is a great movie, filled with hilarious dialogue and the now familiar characters of Kevin Smith's universe.  This is the first Kevin Smith movie so don't worry about not being privy to any inside jokes here.<BR>The movie itself is dialogue propelled, and it works very well.  The jokes are constent yet never getting in the way of the plot.  Smith's direction, often criticized, is rather good here.  The dull setting of the Quick Stop is kept fresh using diferrent locations of the store, both outside and in.<BR>The dvd is also worth getting for the commentary.  Rather than sounding like many of the elitist directors that record commentaries these days, Smith sounds comfortable and casual, as if he was just one of your buddies.
0312305060|4.0|I've never read Virginia Wolfe so I went into this with no expectations.  Here were my primary reactions:  A bit too talky up to the third or fouth chapter.  Amazing that a man did such a great job of speaking in a feminine voice.  All characters were just a bit too outside the the norm, too extreme (except Clarissa) to really relate to them.  The homosexuality theme was redundant and contrived and did nothing to drive plot.  I especially liked the Laura Brown character whose visions were so intense it seemed her brain would burst.  <br />The book was a very worthwhile experience although I found myself in a state of depression while reading it.  The author did a great job on a complicated structure.  I would recommend it.
B000003BEV|5.0|...Sgt. Pepper rip-off? No! If this is a Sgt. Pepper rip-off, then think of everything else that must be. Sgt. Pepper was a defining moment in psychedelia. Getting off-topic here. In conclusion, this album is great, offering a great bands take on one of the best genres of music ever! Buy it!!!

0743455967|5.0|This book was fascinating to read -- an open glimpse into the mind of the master himself.  He begins with a short memoir on his own life, which reads much like one of his novels.  Here, the reader is able able to get a good understanding about his motivations for writing.<br />The remaining two-thirds of the book is then dedicated to tips on the craft itself, interwoven with numerous numerous examples from other authors, as well as his own.  It's intersting to see his perspective which authors and writing styles he likes (and doesn't).  In essence, his tone to aspiring writers is one of encouragement, interspersed with a good dose of realism. According to King, a poor writer cannot learn to become a good one, but a good writer can certainly learn to become a better one.  <br />In brief, here are his main points:<br />1) Read often, write often. <BR>2) Omit needless words (an oft repeated mantra of Strunk and White).<BR>3) Stay within your own vocabulary level. Writing above it is unnecessary and pretentious. <BR>4) Dialogue should reflect reality.  Use profanity if necessary.  <BR>5) Keep descriptions simple. Being too elaborate only distracts the  reader. Provide just enough information simply to spark the reader's imagination. <BR>6) Don't write to please everyone.  Instead, write specifically for an &quot;ideal reader&quot;. Ask what he/she would think about what you just wrote. <BR>7) Conscientious editing: Length of second draft should be first draft, less 10%. <BR>8) Write about what you are genuinely interested in.  You must have a passion for writing.<BR>9) Be disciplined.  Spend a consistent block of time every day achieving a specified goal.  He suggests 1,000 - 2,000 words.<BR>10) Writing is like fossil hunting.  All the bones (ideas) are present already, it's simply your job to dig them up. <br />There's nothing groundbreaking about his advice on writing. It's more or less common sense. But aspiring writers should find it interesting to learn from this book how King was able to use common sense to propel himself to the top of the profession today.
1400034779|5.0|Precious Ramotswe is the thirty-something protagonist of Alexander McCall Smith's successful series about a lady detective in Botswana. The first book of the series is \\"The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency,\\" in which Smith gives the back story of how Ramotswe came to be the first female detective in Botswana.<br />Mma Ramotswe, as she is known throughout the book, is the only child of Obed Ramotswe, whom she idolizes. Since her mother died when she was young, Mma Ramotswe learned about life from her father. Obed owned a big herd of cattle, which his daughter inherited upon her father's death. She uses the proceeds from the sale of her father's cattle to buy a house on Zebra Drive and set up her detective agency.<br />Using lyrical prose, Smith does a brilliant job of imbuing his book with the ambiance of Botswana. We see the thorn and acacia trees on the horizon, we marvel at the colorful birds as they swoop down from the sky, we taste the sand of the Kalahari Desert, and we feel the leisurely, gentle pace of everyday life in Botswana.<br />Ramotswe is a thoroughly entertaining character. She is fat and proud of her girth, and she is confident in her ability to read human nature. Ramotswe investigates cases of various con men, a misbehaving daughter, and a missing husband. Although she has no experience as a detective, she uses common sense, intuition, and her professional bible, \\"The Principles of Private Detection,\\" by Clovis Andersen, to guide her. More often than not, she comes to the correct conclusion.<br />However, Ramotswe is not simply a female Sherlock Holmes. She is a kind and compassionate individual who is careful to use the information she gleans to help her clients live a better life. Her support system consists of Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni, mechanic extraordinaire (and her not-so-secret admirer) and her talented secretary, Mma Makutsi.<br />\\"The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency\\" is a throwback to a kinder gentler detective novel. Instead of violence and mayhem, Smith writes about the psychology of human nature and he emphasizes the importance of knowing who you are and of having a secure place in the world. He also stresses the satisfaction that comes from loving your land and your neighbors. If you want an exotic, sweet, and utterly enchanting novel about a most unusual detective, start reading this series. I guarantee that you will be eager to read the rest of the series, as well.yhem, Smith writes about the psychology of human nature and he emphasizes the importance of knowing who you are and of having a secure place in the world.

6303314015|5.0|I don't know how someone could make and create a movie this extraudinary.  I fell in love with it the moment I saw it.  Not the normal Disney movie.  I surprise myself.  I know every single word and scene there is to this movie.  Someone could ask me about something happening in a certain scene and I would know it exactly on the top of my head.  I don't actually try to memorize the movie but what would you expect for a girl who has been watching this movie since the age of 3.  If you haven't seen The Lion King, I advise you to see it, I can promise you, you won't be disappointed.  I have not gone a year without watching this movie at least 20 times.  This has been my favorite movie for 9 years and will forever more be.
1400031354|5.0|In \\"Tears of the Giraffe,\\" by Alexander McCall Smith, Precious Ramotswe has firmly established herself as a detective in Botswana.  Although she is not wealthy, she lives comfortably and she derives enormous satisfaction from her work.  To add to her happiness, she has accepted the marriage proposal of Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni.<br /><br />In this installment of McCall's popular series, Mma Ramotswe investigates the disappearance of a young American man ten years earlier and she looks into the activities of an unfaithful wife.  Both cases are complex and, unlike most detectives, Mma Ramotswe gets personally involved in her client's lives.  She even embroiders the truth to protect the innocent.  This is a huge step for Mma Ramotswe, since she values the truth above all else.  However, she decides to take on the role of a compassionate social worker in addition to her detective duties.<br /><br />\\"Tears of the Giraffe\\" retains the charm and colorful ambiance of the first installment in this captivating series and I recommend it highly.
B00005YU1O|5.0|I accidentally stumbled upon this movie on cable and I absolutely adored it, and knew I had to own it!  If you are the type who likes books or movies that provoke your thoughts or change your way of thinking, this is perfect for you.  After watching it I knew I would never look at human existence the same way again.  Watching this movie requires you to do some thinking on your own as you watch.  It will introduce you to new ideas and get your brain going.  The philosophies discussed in this movie are really very profound and enlightening, all set to a beautiful soundtrack and an unusual style of animation that is both realistic and surreal at the same time.<br />If you are a &quot;thinker,&quot; you will LOVE this movie.
0375422307|5.0|Satrapi's story of her childhood during the Islamic revolution is an engaging tale of teenage rebellion and precocious moral awareness that forms the backbone of a larger history Iran.  Satrapi does an excellent job of providing a historical timeline that highlights the key events leading up to the revolution and, in the opinion of this reviewer, accurately criticizes virtually all the major players for the wrongs they committed.<br />Persepolis is in some ways a fusion of Joe Sacco's \\"Palestine\\" and Sattareh Farman Farmaian's \\"Daughter of Persia.\\"  Satrapi's woodcut-style illustrations fit the simplified narrative.  The graphic novel format makes Persepolis an easy read - something you can pass off to a friend that won't take more than a couple of hours of their time.
0316666343|5.0|I personally found this book to be extremely good. For those that have lost someone special in their lives before the idea of people looking down from heaven is extremely inspiring.The story is about a girl who gets murdered, and goes to heaven. From there, she sees how her family struggles to carry on and how her killer goes on like nothing happen. The story is extremely catching, and you can never put it down. I would recommend it to anyone who has lost someone special in their lives and is still couping with it.
B00000JGEI|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE ARNOLD HAS EVER MADE. I AM HIS BIGGEST FAN. I WISH I COULD GIVE THIS MOVIE 10 STARS. THIS MOVIE IS A CLASSIC. THE FIRST ONE WAS GOOD AND ALL BUT HIS ONE BEATS IT BY ALOT. THE GRAPHICS, THE ACTION, ITS ALL GOOD, THE BEST PART IS WHEN HES SHOOTIN THE MINI GUN AND DESTROYIN THE COP CARS, THAT WAS A SCENE I WILL NEVER FORGET. NOW T3 IS COMING OUT AND MAYBE IT WILL BEAT T2 BUT I DOUBT IT.
B00005UWCV|3.0|All right, well. First of all, the singing was all right. The Lion King, Alladin, and Beauty and the Beast were much better. Second, as many people have said, Anastasia was not a child. Third, Rasputin was DEAD when the Winter Palace was raided. Before he died, he wrote a note to the Czarina that if he was murdered they wouldn't last a year, and if he died of natural causes, the Romanovs would survive. He was murdered, and the Romanovs fell soon after. He wouldn't want to destroy the Romanovs. If anything, he would want to bring them back to power. Without the Romanovs, he was really nothing. He would rather have found Anastasia, killed Lenin, and restored her to power. I think Stalin or Lenin would have made much better villains, or even Trotsky or Molotov.
B000055WIQ|5.0|I've lately started (very carefully) to watch horror movies and thrillers. It took me over 6 months, though, before I had guts to rent The exorcist. Some of my friends told me it's boring and no scary at all, and at the same time I heard just the opposite.<BR> I watched it at daytime. I watched it totally without sound. I listened to the classical music while watching it. I watched some parts speeded up. From time to time I took my glasses off. Most of the ending part I watched through my fingers...<BR> And still... Afterwards I was so upset I couldn't keep my thoughts straight. I've never in my life been so scared! I believe that the horror movies' effectiveness depends on how much truth there is in them. I don't mean that all the monsters are real, but the horror-genre plays with our images about what is beyond the world we &quot;know&quot;. If this movie scares you or not, it depends pretty much on how you see the life itself, and if you let through the eternal question: is there something or someone I can't see? Beware, people! Satan is real!
B000024JEX|5.0|Something for everyone. Really.<BR>   What I liked most about this stuff is its rich harmonies and its unbelievable consistency. I had a listen to the set at a friend's house thinking I could find two or three good tracks hidden amongst the rubble, but I was genuinely surprised to find two cds of really excellent, unique stuff (cds 3 and 5) and 4 cds of high quality standards playing. <BR>   And most importantly, it's all different. From the odd cute little tune (Straight, No Chaser) to some really outstanding long explorations of some great standards, this set holds your interest and keeps it for longer than a 6 cd set should. I've gotta say, Jarrett's On Green Dolphin Street and 23 minutes Autumn Leaves are the best playings of those standards I've ever heard. It's a real shame it's so hard to find this stuff, so picking it up at a garage sale for $30 made my day...<BR>   Definitely worth tracking down.
0812550706|5.0|A friend recomended this book to me, and I went in skeptical.  I came out the next day(!) amazed with what I had just been unable to put down.  I went through it again, picked up some things I had missed, and I was hooked.  I love this book, it's that simple. The rest of the series is OK, but this one is the best.  For a younger audience, I suggest skipping the rest of the Ender Cycle and going into the Shadow Cycle (a.k.a. the Bean Cycle).  If you like the Dune series, and I mean the whole thing, the rest of the Ender books are for you.  Also, while this is considered a Military SciFi novel, I find myself wavering on that point.  Hardcore MSF fans might not find this to be their thing.  But, try it anyway, you might suprise yourself.

I've heard a lot--some good, some great, and some not so great. <br />I bought this album based on the limited number of times I heard them on radio, and also, a TV appearance. So..not knowing what to really expect...<br />This is without question the best group album I've heard since U2's &quot;Joshua Tree.&quot;

B000002NJS|5.0|Ray Of Light was Madonnas first album in four years (the previous being the stellar Bedtime Stories). This album is essential, it is stunning. The songs are so well crafted that I feel that it's wasted sometimes on me. There are no words without repeating to express this albums brilliance. I suggest this album highly. The best songs are; Drowned World/Substitute For Love, Swim, Ray Of Light, Candy Perfume Girl, Skin, Frozen and Power Of Goodbye. <br />YOU HAVE GOT TO GET THIS ALBUM! Even if you hate Madonna this albums brilliance transcendes your hate, it's rock with electronica mixed in.
0316666343|5.0|Okay, in short: I LOVED this book!  But I did need the tissues quite a few times (almost every chapter, if not more often than that).  I got this book at the library because I'd had so many people tell me, \\"You've GOT to read this book.  YOU would LOVE it!\\"  So, I grabbed it on Friday.  I finished on Saturday.  I found it VERY hard to put down.<br />In a nutshell, what this book has going for it is VOICE.  The main character (as you know if you've read enough reviews about this one) is a dead girl in heaven.  Her story, while fast-paced and thrilling is also one that tugs at your heart.  You really want the bad guy to get caught and for her family to find her body, so they'll have closure in their lives.  Will her family move on without her?  Will they remember her?  You sit down with Susie and feel all of her wonderings and desires.  The scenes with her family, who were having such a difficult time dealing with her disappearance and death, were the most heartbreaking scenes that I've read in a long time.<br />Will you like the book?  Probably.  I LOVED it.  This is definitely the BEST book I have read in a while.  If Oprah still had her book club running with new books (she's into classics now) this would have been an excellent choice for her and there's no doubt in my mind that she would have picked this book.  When you read this book, grab one for a friend too.  You'll want to talk to someone who has read it and it will drive you crazy if you have no one to talk to.  Trust me!  :)
6303471501|5.0|As an Aussie who saw this as a boy way back in 1980 I am saddened and dumbfounded to find that this was ever the victim of pathetic overdubs into US speak from the original Australian, as though this helped the film in any way? Was the premise that Americans are so jingoistic that they aren't capable of understanding English spoken by Australians, or simply that Americans only want to hear themselves? In any case this is a classic Aussie film back in the days when Mel Gibson considered himself an Aussie and was seen by Aussies to be an Australian.<br />I won't harp on about the plot because other reviewers have done the plot to death. This film was shot in South Australia and the many brilliant and genius techniques for filming the amazing road scenes were developed by the Australian Director of this movie, later to be adopted by film makers the world over. Anybody who doesn't understand that this movie is the BEST of the series has missed the point of MAD MAX as far as I'm concerned. I'm sure Aussies and Kiwi's alike understand the superb grittyness which has the stamp of Australian and New Zealand (Once Were Warriors) film making all over it without losing all the best features of great film making to HOLLYWOODISM...<br />MAD MAX 2 was also a good film but Thunderdome became too Hollywood for my money and sadly doesn't do justice to the series like the original. I almost feel sorry for people who thought this wasn't ans Australian film... it's like thinking \\"Gone with the Wind\\" was Canadian and sticking \\"eh\\" on the end of \\"Quite frankly I don't give a damn (eh?), talk about inappropriatsville! This is the the ONLY version worth watching...
1558216847|5.0|There are classics and then there are _classics_. This memoir is in the second group, the kind of book that stands apart from those that would claim to be its peers by virtue of its singular vision. The opening pages are right out of Solzhenitsyn, in fact take place in the same prison that he almost lovingly calls the \\"Big Lubyanka\\" in The Gulag Archipeligo. But this is not Solzhenitsyn with his grace and humor and satire and righteous anger recollecting the soul-altering experiences that ironically made him into the great poet of the dismal 20th century. Instead, Rawicz is more of an Everyman, the ordinary Polish cavalry officer trapped without cause within the Soviet penal system. His is not the desire to write the history of the Soviet Union (something Solzhenitsyn eventually does indirectly with the Gulag), but rather the more basic impulse just to be free. Even if that means the travails of a year-long journey on foot through one hardship after another, freedom will not be denied him.<br />There are mysteries aplenty in this book. How can Rawicz recall the details and dialog that he does years after the fact? Who is the unnamed American who accompanies Rawicz and the others on the walk and what was he really doing in the Soviet Union? Why did Rawicz lose contact with all his boon companions after the war? The reader can be forgiven for suspecting that there are other things at work here below the text, that something was lost or altered in the transformation from memory to an English that he learned only later when living in England.<br />But still, this is a magnificent book. I've given numerous copies to friends and strangers. Walkers and hikers in particular should enjoy this story, for beneath the horrors of starvation and death there lies the secret joy of a truly open-ended walk, epic in length, outside and alive and free.<br />One other happy point about this book: No movie was ever made out of this story. Rawicz has somehow been able to keep his book alive and free and unmuddied as well.
0553208845|1.0|I am in the minority compared to the other reviews but I wanted to give a teenager's perspective of this book. I'm 15 and maybe when I'm 30 I'll like the book but I had to read it for an english class in 10th grade and it was awful reading. to anyone who has a choice to read this book or anything else, pick the latter- it drones on and on about siddhartha finding inner peace, exploring different ways of life, and &quot;discovering himself&quot;. it sends an awful message to kids as he contemplates suicide not once but twice because he is merely unhappy with himself at that moment. there are pages upon pages which are entirely composed of siddhartha talking to himself, then contradicting himself, and so on. in all, the &quot;action&quot; in this book could be summed up in about 2 pages and I had trouble staying awake through even the first chapter. if you have to read this, heres a tip: get sparknotes.

0790743132|5.0|&quot;Casablanca&quot; is one of those movies where you can't call yourself a filmlover without seeing it. It's a must in every sense of the word.

And maybe it is.<br /> &quot;Casablanca&quot; tells the story of Rick Blaine a hard as nails nightclub owner played by Bogart. He says he will never put his neck out of anyone. But, wait until the time comes. Blaine has left American well, it seems he was thrown out. He has made the best of it though. Blaine seems like the kind of guy who has a lot of stories to tell.

He now with his wife have found themselves in Casablanca. But what Victor does now is that the German army is waiting for him.<br /> This is one part of the story. Rick Blaine a man who says he keeps to himself is soon place in a postition where he must make a choice.

A love affair had started and soon she tells Rick they must part. And they have not seen each since. Until as fate would have it Victor and Ilsa come to Casablanca and into Rick's club.<br /> &quot;Casablanca&quot; has proven itself to be a great movie. I bet even if it wouldn't have won the &quot;Best Picture&quot; Oscar it would still be a movie filmgoers would love. There seems to be something universal in it's appeal.

038572179X|4.0|Atonement consists of 4 sections, with the first section comprising about half the book.  This section is set at an English country house between the world wars, takes place primarily in one day, and is populated with a mother, 3 siblings, a visitor, 3 cousins, and a family protégé.  It shifts narrative perspective between the characters, but it is the youngest sibling, a young 13 year old aspiring writer, who is the primary character.  The writing in this section is often beautiful; however, it  has that almost repetitious quality that, while very effective,  made this reader sometimes want to say, enough.  This first section begins with the production of a play by the 13 year old, and this entire narrative thread is unnecessarily long.  The rest of the book is written with an economy of style and is quite arresting. The second section  is narrated by an infantryman during the retreat to Dunkirk, and really stands on its own as a an excellent piece of writing, although it fits into the overall schema of the novel.  In fact, one of the outstanding qualities of the novel is how all the sections fit together, so that the whole is so much more than the sum of the parts.
B000002TQV|5.0|I didn't believe in the old adage that some music just gets better the more you listen to it, until I bought this album. Upon first listening it seemed to be just another slightly stroppy, slightly rocky, lethargically narcissistic indie album that wasn't worth a second look. However, on recommendation of friends, I stuck with it, and very rewarding it turned out to be indeed.<BR>The Bends is the sort of album you should have a long-term and meaningful relationship with rather than an exciting but hollow one-night stand. Tend to it, caress it, respond to its every need and it will reciprocate. It will be a faithful companion through the highs and the lows, always there to mask the bleak emptiness of your lonely, cold, clammy single bed.<BR>From start to finish it doesn't let up, and once you've been sucked into the addictively asphyxiating current of Planet Telex, you won't want, or indeed be able to escape from Radiohead's unreservedly cynical wrath until you are washed ashore, soggy, bruised and tired, by the closing seconds of the stark anthemic misery of Street Spirit (Fade Out).<BR>The Bends contains moments which can be ominously uplifting at their most optimistic, and at times, can be as gloomily depressing as listening to MatronsApron's Sad Song whilst treading in dog muck on the way back from a doctor's appointment in which you have just found out that you have six weeks to live, and it's your birthday in seven.<BR>This is an album that should be issued with a government health warning, and, much like smoking, is horrible at first, but keeps one pretending to like it for aesthetic purposes only, until eventually, one finds that one is hopelessly addicted.
B00008S2VG|1.0|When I bought Music a few years ago I was afraid Madonna was hitting another low point in her career. American Life has proven that she is in another slump. Her songwriting on this album is contrived and manipulative. The title track is a fluffy song about how superficial fame and celebrity are. This topic is not new for Madonna (check out Substitute for Love and Goodbye to Innocence for superior songs on this topic). She continues with the silly child like writing skills that she began with Music and the &quot;skipping sound&quot; is also continued on this CD. The familiar vocoders are also present along with a couple of &quot;minimalist folk/electronica&quot; songs. Madonna and her producer have brought nothing new to the table with American Life. In fact this album should be retitled &quot;Music: the b-sides&quot;
B00008J4P5|5.0|While I understand, intellectually, that the Beatles probably made a greater contribution to rock and roll; in my heart, no one will ever be able to convince me that Led Zeppelin wasn't the greatest rock band that ever was.  So for me to compare anyone to them is the highest compliment I can possibly give.  On &quot;Elephant&quot; Jack White reinvents heavy blues rock with the skronkiest, funkiest, blues-oozingest album since Led Zeppelin IV.  His riffs are absolutely filthy and his singing recaptures the exquisite bombast of great arena rock frontmen like Robert Plant and Freddie Mercury.  In an era of slickly produced teen charlatans, cookie-cutter punks, and disaffected indie-rock mumblers, Jack White stands out as a true Rock Star.  Amazing.

0425170349|5.0|I will admit, I am more of a John Clark fan than a Jack Ryan fan and this accounts for a lot when I picked this book off of the shelf. Now...<BR>To begin, this book has it all: an unbelievable plot, the ultimate bad guys, great action sequences, and Jonh Clark and Domingo \\"Ding\\" Chavez, as well as a string of new and old characters in the Ryan/Clark universe.<BR>Rather than give a synopsis, I will give the fine points of the book. To begin, it is obvious that Clancy did NOT want to mention Jack Ryan by name, and only refers to him as \\"The President\\" (which is a nice homeage to the presidents before Bob Fowler). This is somewhat like Without Remorse, but Clancy could not resist placing his star in that novel. Next, it is nice to see clark giving orders rather than taking them, though he has not severed his CIA ties, as mary Pat and Ed Foley are referred to a few times in the novel. Older characters appear in this book, such as Julio \\"Oso\\" Vega and Dan Murray. The plot is modern, and takes away from Clancy's old villians (the Soviets/Russians) and his nw villians (the Chinese). In truth, the villains in the first half of the novel are reminiscant to the IRA fundamentalists in Patriot Games. The star villains of the second half bring to light events like Oklahoma City and the Uni-Bomber by dealing with domestic terrorists, as well as reminding us of executive orders as many are supposed allies of the president.<BR>Low points in the book are few, but as with any novel, there are some. The fight scenes are not that dramatic, though elaborate. At points, the bad guys can do things that make a reader wonder if Clancy has some psychological repressions, but in true Clancy style, the wrong-doers do pay. As with other novels, all of the characters refer to doctors as \\"doc's.\\" Otherwise, it is difficult to spot lower aspects.<BR>This book is perfect for an action reader, and is designed for a younger generation of Clancy fans. It is a good way to enter the Clancy universe, as,though the past novels are heavily mentioned, you need not have read them to understand them, for Clancy explains the references fairly well.<BR>I hope you found this review useful, and I hope you buy the book. It is an excellent read, so enjoy.
0316666343|4.0|I agree with a lot of the reviews I've read of this book.  Sebold's portrayal of life is original, from other books I've read, and beautiful in many ways.  I think most people like to think about what life is like after death, and the portrayal in this book is just fascinating, if somewhat hollow.  Its organization is sometimes difficult to follow, contributing, I suppose, to its surreal feel.  In spite of that, it's a fast and basically light read, particularly in the beginning.   <br />My critique of this book is that it was a novel and not a short story.  By about a third of the way through the book, I couldn't help thinking that the details were present in excessive abundance.  I wished for a faster moving story, and I think this may well have been one of the most perfect stories I've ever read if only it had been just a bit more focused and, thus, shorter.  None-the-less, I have to recommend the book.<br />...
B000092ZYX|3.0|Their was a time when I thought Radiohead was the best thing since Oasis, even though they released their first CD before them.  I thought that every album they released was a masterpiece.  I even thought that Amnesiac was fantastic for Cripes' sake!  Then I woke up to the fact that there are a lot of better bands out there.  Oh yes, there are better bands than Radiohead.<br />Hail to the Thief is nothing more than another boring departure from Radiohead's original goodness.  I think that there's nothing wrong with experimenting but Radiohead has been trying to reinvent themselves ever since 97's success with OK Computer.  Kid A was a \\"masterpiece\\" in that Radiohead turned their back on music.  With Amnesiac, they turned Kid A into a mess.  With Hail to the Thief, they have made a mess of themselves.  There's nothing really interesting here.  None of these songs will be memorable in a few years like their earlier work.  \\"There, There\\", first single, is out of place on the disc.  It's as if Radiohead realized they didn't have a single on the CD and threw it on there for old time's sake.  ...
B00003CXTG|3.0|The feature itself try far to hard to fold in the Love theme that made the movie Titanic so rewarding, but the love triangle that Michael Bay set to the background of the December 7, 1941 bombing of pearl harbor fell far short of holding my interest, I found the entire side story to be quite bland and the big payoff is only at the end when Hartnett's character finally meets his demise. The dialouge in the movie also sub-par and even corny at times. The action scenes in the movie are incredible and worth watching the movie, even if it means sitting through nearly ninty minutes of chick flick. <br />  The DVD is a two disc set and the feature is spread over those two disc, why I have know idea.  With the abscence of any commentary the movie fell within the disc compacity. i alaways frowned at the idea of having to change disc halfway through a movie and it is just not needed here. The special aren't too bad. First we have the documentary, Journey to the Screen: The Making of Pearl Harbor which is your standard behind the scenes special, there is also a full length histry channel special about the unsung hero's of Pearl Harbor, some trailers, and a muisc Video by Faith Hill.
B000002BBY|5.0|I'm 17 years old.  I never really got into the Beatles.  The first time I heard &quot;Wonderwall&quot; was a year ago.  Yeah, I had been living under a rock for quite sometime, but I'm out now and I have What's the Story Morning Glory to thank for it.  I believe that this is Oasis's greatest CD, in that it appeals to all fans of music, while some of their other discs only hit the spot for hardcore fans such as myself.  I listen to all kinds of music and I don't think anyone comes close to what these guys are doing.  This album is a timeless masterpiece.  Every song on here is so simply appealing and perfect, that's the only bad thing I can think of about the CD.  It's easy to take songs like &quot;Hey Now&quot; and &quot;She's Electric&quot; for granted.  On any other album, by any other band, they would be fillers, but they fit perfectly into the genius of this disc.  With enough classic songs of our time and true rock and roll fun attitude to back it up, What's the Story Morning Glory is one of the if not THE greatest album of all time.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This CD represents a four piece band at it's finest.  Today's rock music has lost &quot;the hook&quot; it once had, but is now reborn in Audioslave.  I was also never a &quot;Rage&quot; fan, but had seen them perform on a few TV shows and always thought 'what a great band, except the lead vocals are a bit to much for me.  Now, the &quot;circle&quot; is complete.  I have not heard the whole cd yet but I can barely discribe the sheer perfection in compositon &amp;all elements of the guitar sound and vocal texture.  God please let Audioslave continue.  Chris is, to say the least, an amazing artist in the true Seattle form.

If you want some really good music, though, check out something new.
B00005JKPF|5.0|This was an excellent movie...i would describe it as Star Trek on land, and the people have build in weapons. The X-Men are back once again and the characters from the 1st are back, plus some additional ones. This is one movie where the sequel is actually better than the original!
B00006LLNU|5.0|Perhaps you've heard that this album in sung in the language of Hopelandic, a mixture of Icelandic, and the minds of the band Sigur Ros.  It's my thought that this album is a rebellion on words, making it perhaps, one of the best concept albums in the history of music.  <br />Concepts supporting my theory:<BR>1) This album is sung a language no listener will understand<BR>2) The lyric book is nothing but blank pages<BR>3) The title () cannot be pronounced<BR>4) The only words on the entire cd case or cd itself are 'Sigur Ros'.  All the others are stickers, littering the plastic wrapper of the cd.<br />I believe they are trying to ease our culture's dependence on words, and send us more into emotions.  Well, I'm not sure it worked, because you take much more time DESCRIBING the title, instead of just saying it, but it's a good jumping off point.
6305327041|3.0|Right off the bat:  The first two segments of this film are godawful pointless mind-numbing garbage.  The Tarantino and Rodriguez segments, however, are five star shorts that showcase all of their considerable talents.  Rodriguez's story is very funny and the direction is excellent.  It's fascinating seeing such a frenetic director trapped in a single room, allowing his style to build a gleeful tension perfect for his odd tale.  Tarantino gives us a bizarre gem that feels like a prologue or interlude for one of his films.  His dialogue is endlessly fascinating and he manages to create something wildly original out of an old, well-known tale.
B00005V9HH|5.0|The first time I saw this movie, I turned it off after about 20 minutes.  I was thinking, what the hell is going on here?  No one had told me that that responce was to be expected, and you're really not supposed to get the beginning until you've seen the end.  So, in my confusion, I was still sure based on the stellar performances, and the mere presence of Kevin Spacey, that this was a good movie, and I was just the idiot who gave up on it too fast.<br />So I rented it again, and this time watched it the whole way through.  I still didn't understand the first 20 minutes, but it becones clearer after that.  Boy oh boy, is this a good movie.  It twists, and turns, and flashed back, and forth, and everything is spinning rapidly out of control, until the last minute & 30 seconds, when everything is completely cleared up; it's like a mind colonic.<br />So please, take the warning that no one gave me, and be prepared to be confused beyond anything else, except maybe \\"Mulholland Dr\\"...
B00006F7S4|5.0|Beck's music has seemingly evolved from playful dabbling in funk excursions, folk songs, hip-hop or even techno and metabolized into a fullblown masterpiece of straightforward, crestfallen elegance. The abounding melancholia on Sea Change is potent enough to crush one's heart. The lyrics are humble and graceful, the music pristine and unabashed. Sea Change captures Beck's unique songwriting ability in an ultimate form of graceful austerity that sings as gently as the wind, and at the same time, roars like a tumultuous ocean. Beck obviously poured out his heart and soul on Sea Change, and his new unsolicited sound is magnificently evoked.
B00006879E|5.0|Well, I picked this album up at my local Borders because.. hey I thought it looked interesting. Maroon 5 provides sensitive lyrics along with funky beats. It's fun to listen to, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B000003TAR|5.0|In Utero is my favorite Nirvana record, and probably my favorite record of all time. When i first got this a couple of years ago, i wasn't sure what to expect. i thought everything would be sub pop (ha ha ha pun intended!). But after listening to Serve the Servants, i knew everything would be ok. then came scentless aprentice, then heart shaped box, etc... well needless to say, by the end of the record i was really happy that i bought it.<BR>The aborted fetuses are pretty cool too.
6302994063|5.0|This is one of Baz Lurhman's breakthrough movies, before his great Moulin Rouge, and his skill for showing the odd side of normal people and the normal side of odd people is prevalent in this highly funny, warmly engaging and endearingly romantic movie.  Set against the often over-the-top world of competitive ballroom dancing, the characters are nonetheless real and understandable, especially the two leads.  A definite must see!
B00005B36H|5.0|This was the first Tool album I actually bought, as I'd used... to get MP3's before it.  I had only songs from the previous albums, so the first time I played this CD, it was totally new.<br />And man, did it blow me away.<br />From the first mechanical griding sound right before the Grudge's guitar kicked in, through the slow revolutions of Schism, into the powerful Parabola, to the incredible title track and the final track, this album is truly incredible.<br />Lateralus is, without a doubt, progressive rock through and through, harking back to the old band King Crimson many a time.  It's a shame only Schism is being noticed the way it is, as I, and many others, find Lateralis and Parabol/a to be underrated perfection.  This album is a great change from the angrier, grittier AEnima and Undertow, and it seems far more polished and, as the Amazon reviewer said, crisper and clearer.  This album is worth the money, easily, and probably even more so.<br />True gold.
0385504209|5.0|This is another great winner from Dan Brown, full of suspense, intellect and twists on history...it's biggest thrill is that most of it is based on fact.  The DaVinci code is a fabulous read.  While not too weighty to make it unapproachable for non-historians, it's intriguing and twists and turns in ways that you won't expect.<br />The basic premise starts with a murder mystery that turns into a history lesson...or a twist on the a history lesson regarding the Knights Templar and a secret society in existence for centuries, millenia even.  Other books like \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\\" explore the same themes in a non-fiction way, but this book puts forth the ideas in a thrilling, exciting and intriguing way.<br />Dan Brown's greatest ability, I think, is that he is able to take an obscure historical fact and educate you about it without you known it...all the way engrossing you in the action, mystery and romance of the story.<br />Definitely pick up this book!
0142000663|5.0|When I read the last page of this book I was stunned in a way that is hard to describe.  I have never had such a deep emotional reaction to any book before or since.  Just read it.  It's an incredible experience.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|Romantic, funny, witty and charming, this is a wonderful adaptation of Jane Austen's book \\"Emma\\" starring Gwyneth Paltrow and the infernally sexy Jeremy Northam, with wonderful supporting turns by the Ewan McGregor, Greta Saaci and the ever-greasy Alan Cumming.  Shot was lovely costumes and views of the British countryside, this is engaging and romantic period film captures the essence of the requirements of manners of the period.<br />Fans of the book might have problems with the casting of Toni Collette as Emma's protegee and matchmaking victim, as she in only very few ways resembles the original character.  However, Sophie Thompson is a standout as Miss Bates and Juliet Stevenson, as the wife of the Reverend, is wonderfully unappealing as a party guest.  <br />A very, very enjoyable movie!
B000060P79|1.0|To start off, the only reason I purchased this cd was because the song I'm Just A Kid was on the new guy soundtrack and i love that movie. So i thought that i'd try this cd out just to give them a try. That was a BIG mistake. These guys consider themselves punk!?!? IN THEIR DREAMS. The singer, Pierre, sounds like he hasn't gone throught puberty!!! So overall I think I like the cover more than anything else on this cd!
B00000255F|5.0|....this is the best rock and roll album ever recorded.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|I sit and watch this gem of a movie and think about a song by Neil Diamond, &quot;Heartlight&quot;.<br />Yes, after all these years the end still moves me to weep.  But it's worth it.<br />&quot;I'll be right here.&quot; - E.T.
B00009P1O2|5.0|If only other record companies would take note of this generous production.  Rather than cheaply issueing the previously available VHS concert on the DVD format which is sadly the norm...and often with little picture or sound upgrade.....THIS is how it should be done.<br />1) the concert in its entirety, with more footage than previously avialable and presented from the BEST source material and its very very good.<br />2) the BONUS material on disc TWO and this is the huge difference<BR>1) a new feature on recalling the show which is a very revealing and interesting program watchable more than once<BR>2) a documentary featuring interviews and footage surrounding the concert with many backstage interviews which is a wonderful accompanyment to the concert<BR>3) several songs from the show which feature multi angle viewing so the viewer can watch any of the players isolated during the entire song or bounce around.  This is really fun to see Freddie during Brian's solos or watch John bounce around stage with his Bass, sort of a loose canon...<BR>4)rehearsal and footage from Fridays concert...THIS is amazing stuff and the performance of Crazy Little Thing called love in the rain is epic....<br />and MORE footage and MORE interviews etc etc.<br />If you like Queen , this is a slam dunk, if you like music , this is a must .  We know that this type of footage exists for many other acts and why they don't issue proper DVDs and take advantage of this format to present definitive versions of programs previously available on VHS irks many of us.  I hope everybody buys this DVD and thereby sends a message to the labels that we DO appreciate the extra money and effort to make definitive presentations ......and perhaps this will be imitated by others.....
B00005YW4H|5.0|Soothing, relaxing and without a doubt, charming - this cd EVEN converted me to jazz. Every song is just a gem and her voice is just soo soothing ..i feel like she's singing lullabyes to me. Also, it's such a great record to listen up in your room and escaped the hectic world we call life. Everytime i listen to the record..i can picture myself in a recluded beach house watching the waves and enjoying myself. So you can say the title of the cd is appropiately titled cuz i sure would love Norah to &quot;come away with me&quot;. : )
B000002MP2|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS A PUNK CLASSIC,IT'S SIMPLY A MASTERPIECE,WITH SONGS LIKE &quot;BASKET CASE&quot; &quot;WELCOME TO PARADISE&quot; AND &quot;WHEN I COME AROUND&quot; IN HERE,HOW COULD THIS ALBUM NOT BE THE BEST?
B000083E79|5.0|Excellent if you're a Cher fan.
0385504209|4.0|I just recently saw \\"The Adoration of the Magi\\" in the Uffizi in Florence, so this book really resonates for me.  It makes me want to go back and take a fresh look at Botticelli's art, at the Mona Lisa, medieval architecture, and the Bible.  I rarely put much credence in elaborately constructed conspiracies, but there is much to fascinate in this novel.  The only people I've ever known who were Masons, Rosicrucians, members of various Catholic subcultures, and so forth always struck me as supremely silly people with too much time on their hands.  Maybe I ought to take a closer look at them too!
B00008CLOA|5.0|I like Pink Floyd's music but I don't \\"love\\" their music. The only exception is, of course, \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\". This is Floyd's masterpiece. Thirty years later and music enthusiasts from all walks of life are still talking about this one. I have three different releases of \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" (four releases if you include this version) and this \\"remastered-hybrid\\" version is the best release I've heard to date. My \\"audio-quality\\" comparisons include Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab's CD (which, by the way, gets blown away by this hybrid SACD, and I haven't even heard it on a SACD player yet!)<BR>Audiophiles please note that I do not have the \\"UK Harvest-Made in Japan\\" CD in my collection so I cannot do a fair comparison between the two. To sum it all up, I highly recommend purchasing this release. You won't be disappointed ...
630463949X|5.0|The passion, the power, the musicianship, it's all here from the greatest Fleetwood Mac line-up ever. Mick Fleetwood and John McVie keep the show nailed down with the finest rhythm section I've ever heard, thanks to their almost mutual telepathy. Christine McVie looks alittle bored at times, but cheers up when she sings her own songs in her beautiful dulcet tones, whilst sparks fly between Stevie Nicks and Lindsay Buckingham, especially during their amazing duet rendition of \\"Landslide\\". For me, Lindsay Buckingham is the man of this show, in part thanks to his mind-blowing solo rendition of \\"Big Love\\", but also because he extracts such beautiful sounds from his guitar all over this disk. If you enjoy this band's music to any great extent, you simply won't get bored of this DVD.
0783226063|5.0|This movie is a work of art. I can rarely watch a movie more than once, but this movie I have watched many times. The actors are all simply incredible, it seems you can feel their enthusiam. Jose Ferrer as the emperor is outstanding. Some liberties were taken...oh shucks. This movie stands on its own two feet. There is a quality in this movie that is unexplainable, an element of fantasy and nightmare. Even small details, like the sound of the alarm in the emperor's palace, give one a strange feeling. Forgive my crudeness, but please ignore the sterile imaginations and lack of vision the negative reviewers have and enjoy this movie.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Wow! Sensational quality and quantity of live led zepp performances that span a decade. Don't let tarnished memories of &quot;the song remains the same&quot; put you off from splashing out on this two-disc set, as you won't find any rubbishy longwinded fantasy sequences here, just raw, tight performances from this legendary band.
0783225970|1.0|I bought this DVD because it was advertised as \\"The Collector's Edition\\".  In fact it is not.  After doing research on this DVD of Scarface I learned that if you are able to find the true collector's edition it would cost between $50.00 to $200.00 if not more if you are able to find a brand new one.  The true collector's edition was released for a short time and was a two sided disc.  One side was the movie itself, the other side was the bonus materal. All though what is being sold here by sellers does contain some bonus material, but for the most part it does not.  On the original collector's edition as part of the bonus material that was included was the TV version of Scarface which was a different movie, different actors, etc. Don't be fooled by the sellers offering this DVD.  The reality is that what you are paying for is an import (mainly from asian countries)  Some sellers will say that the chapter insert is included, some don't. If you buy a copy that includes the insert it will even tell you about the bonus material that is on the DVD, but in fact most is not included because even the insert was a copy of the original. Don't get me wrong, the movie itself is great, but there is no point of buying this on DVD.  Save yourself a few dollars and buy it on VHS if you can find it, at least you will most likely get the real deal that way, and I think the quality is better that the import that is being sold on DVD.
0790729628|1.0|This is not the first time a Director took a beautiful movie and chop it to pieces.  When &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; was release on VHS they only release the 1980 remake of the film all chop up and ruin. You were unable to enjoy the original version of the film until the new DVD version was release.  But, getting back to BR, Ridley Scott has every right to release a new Director's Cut version but he should have also include the Theater Version which I enjoy most.<br />There is one little mistake that some people seems to be making about both version of the film.  These &quot;Replicant&quot; are neither androids nor robots they are human. They breathe and eat and feel emotions and this is what made this movie different.  By removing the voice over this fact is left out in the Director's Cut.<br />When I first saw BR being air on TV they change the beginning clearly stating that Replicant were Robots.  Yet, in the Theater version and on DVD the beginning message clearly points out that they are not androids but living creatures.  &quot;NEXUS phase --- a being virtually identical to a human --- known as Replicants.&quot;  What made them virtually human were their physical abilities and their life span.  Why would an android burn out just because it burns twice as bright?  Why do they refer to them as being dead before the patient left the table if they were machines?<br />For years I have been seeing some critics referring to these living people as machines.  I guess it is hard to accept the idea that human would make stronger human to do their physical labor for them.<br />Please, do not remind me of &quot;The Terminator!&quot;  In that movie they were machines.<br />I guess some people like the film but object to the main star Harrison Ford gunning down two women.  Why would Deckard say &quot;but it didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman in the back&quot; if these replicants were androids? Now, you can only hear this remark in the original version of the film but it clearly points out that the replicants were not machines.<br />Do us all a favor Mr. Ridley Scott; release both versions on DVD so people can choose for themselves.
B000066NW0|5.0|This is a terrific pop album.  The songs are spunky and fun. The singing and musicianship are fantastic.  Some reviewers here panned this album, but they are missing the point. One person went so far as to say avril is phony. All rock stars are phony. Eminem and Marilyn Manson,  who also play great music, are just as phony. It is all an illusion.  Just sit back and enjoy it.  Don't kid yourself thinking some rock stars are actually not fake. <BR>Avril is not as deep a lyricist as, say Roger Waters, but she isn't supposed to be.
0790729628|1.0|I saw someone asking for a copy of the original version.  I do have two VHS Pre-Recorded copy of the original film but they are not in 2.35:1Ratio.<br />Please do not misunderstand me here, I have no attention in selling them.  I wanted to point out that I waited two years for the original version of Blade Runner to be release on DVD.  After seeing Animal House being remove from the shelves I finaly bought this cut up version of Blade Runner on DVD.  I watch both, VHS and the DVD together, so I can still enjoy the edit parts and see the rest in 2.35:1Ratio.<br />If anyone can tell me how to get that Director Ridley Scott to release both versions on DVD please tell me.
B000002JS6|5.0|It is a fact!!! that AC/DC's album Back In Black is the sixth best selling album of all time in the world. That alone shows that this is the album to buy. With much respect to former front man Bon Scott (who died by choking on his vomit after a night of heavy drinking), this album is the greatest of AC/DC's entire career. And not too many would disagree. I personally like every single song on this CD. It is non-stop Rock N Roll through to the last one. The best songs on the CD would be \\"Hells Bells\\", \\"Shoot To Thrill\\", \\"Back In Black\\", and of course \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\". There is also \\"Have a Drink On Me\\" which was a homage to Bon although they aren't direct with this in the song. And look for some really rockin' guitar riffs in \\"Shake a Leg\\" and \\"Given the Dog a Bone\\". \\"Rock N Roll Ain't Noise Pollution\\" was a great way to top off the album in the end with the phrase \\"Rock N Roll will never die!\\" Many critics have said that this album is crude and obnoxious, but that is why people have liked it. Also people say all their music sounds the same, but that is what makes them great. Explanation: throughout their entire career they have always played the same heavy metal music while so many bands explored newer, but crappier styles of music, and in the end they are admired for that.  Did I mention that AC/DC is the #1 selling hard rock/heavy metal band. Although they have (finally) been inducted in the RNR Hall of Fame, I still think they are underated. They have always been overshadowed by bands like Led Zepplin and Guns N Roses (both are great bands though). This is a must have album. Then you should get \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\", \\"AC/DC Live\\"(Special Collectors Edition) and albums by the equally great front man Bon Scott (\\"High Voltage\\" \\"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap\\" \\"Highway to Hell\\"). I think Brian Johnson was the best person to replace Bon.<br />Other artists I like and recommend: Led Zepplin, Aerosmith, Jimi Hendrix, Guns N Roses, George Thorogood, \\"Slowhand\\" EricClapton, and any southern rock.
B00005JKZU|5.0|So what if they strayed a little off the book while making the movie. It only made the movie better! I also liked Faramir's personality in the movie better. The Lord of the Ring's actors are some of the best actors in the world. The battle of Helm's Deep was Spectacular! If you gave this movie less than 5 stars, I advise you to seek some therapy. Can't wait until the two towers is released on video/DVD! Also can't wait until the Return of the King, December 17th, 2003!
B00008XEOI|5.0|This movie is probably one of my very favorite.  The animation and beautiful colors are wonderful throughout the whole movie.  I know that I sat with my oldest granddaughter through this movie 30 times, and now that my youngest grandson is born... we sit and watch it another 30 times and love it each and every time!!!
B000002GI0|5.0|If you want to explore John Hiatt -- and you should -- start here. If you're a fan without this CD, what in the world are you waiting for? It just doesn't get a whole lot better than this.<br />John Hiatt writes about real life. There are no sappy teenage love songs, but there is a great song, &quot;Drive South,&quot; about two lovers with &quot;heads in the clouds, just a little off-course&quot; and one more chance to make it work.<br />&quot;Trudy and Dave&quot; aren't your average couple, but their descriptions (and the baby's) are laugh-out-loud funny. &quot;Tennessee Plates&quot; has a great, catchy guitar riff and an even better storyline: a lonely, desperate man; a female Elvis fan who's &quot;been living in-between&quot; and a car theft in Memphis.<br />&quot;Georgia Rae&quot; is a song about Hiatt's daughter and fits in well with everything else here. The title song is Hiatt's view of the world: unbowed, but realistic. &quot;Is Anybody There?&quot; will put chills down your spine with its mass choir effect and deep lyrics. &quot;Feels Like Rain&quot; paints a beautiful, languid picture of lovers in the Deep South and the music fits as perfectly as the lovers do.<br />If you like meaningful lyrics, melodies that linger in your head and you still don't have this CD, then you need to do something about it right now. You won't believe how great this is.
B000002H2H|5.0|...On this album Metallica is showing people that the impact of Kill 'Em All was no mistake, they are saying that they are here to stay, from beginning to finish you could listen to this album all the way through and never get bored.<br />The album starts with an Acoustic Guitar playing a ballady type riff, than it blows up, pounding drums, roaring guitars, James Hetfield growling all over the place, Fight Fire With Fire is a great opener to a great Metallica album. The title track comes in with a fast lick featuring Rhythm and Lead guitars fighting for power, than it goes into the main riff with James Hetfield singing about capitol punishment, a great song. For Whom the Bell Tolls is the next track, and it is one of the most well written songs in the history of Heavy Metal, starting with roaring Power Chords, and Cliff Burtons bass comes in, than the main riff, its a classic song. Fade to Black is the bands first ballad, and its easily the best song on the album, James Hetfield sings about suicide, while the rest of the band plays a nice little guitar part in the back, than it blows into a signature Metallica sound, with an awesome Hammet solo to end it. Trapped Under Ice is the next song, and its about being Trapped Under Ice, its a good song as well, but not as good as the rest of the songs. Escape is the only possible piece of filler, but I like it, its about Escaping from somewhere, and has a nice mood to it. Creeping Death is the next song, a huge concert attraction because of the interaction that always takes place between Band and Fans, the song is about Moses leading the Hebrew slaves away from the Egyptian Pharoh. Call of Ktulu is the songs closer, and a great instrumental number it is, exciting the whole way through, great song.<br />So in the end, Ride the Lightning is worth every penny you would pay for it, the first of many classic albums that Metallica released, For Whom the Bell Tolls, Fade to Black and Creeping Death are still played at every live show the band does, and rightfully so, but still, Ride the Lightning does not equal up to the masterpiece that is Master of Puppets, but it sure comes close.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This is NOT your standard action-packed stunt-filled Hollywood blockbuster film.  This IS a very interesting movie that pulls you in, keeps you guessing, and leaves you saying, &quot;WOW! That was a great movie!&quot;  This is NOT the type of film that you can get up in the middle without pausing and go to the bathroom or get a drink of water (you'll miss too much - and it might be important!)  This IS the type of movie that will have you sitting on the edge of your seat and ignoring your ringing cell phone.  This is NOT the type of movie you will want to watch alone.  This IS the type of movie that you will want to watch with friends around, and pause multiple times after key scences to hear what everyone thinks is going on.  Buy it, watch it, and you WILL enjoy it!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Donnie Darko is one of those rare movies with something for everyone that still manages to be completely dark. <BR>As you watch Donnies estranged version of life unfolding, you become increasingly troubled by just how screwed up he probably is, the damage he's capable of doing, and the twisted way everything he says makes sense. <BR> Generally its a movie that will keep you thinking- shallow movie goers will probably think of it as too confusing or that its posing as something more than it is. The interesting thing about the story is that the more you look into it, the less you see these things, and the more you realize the paradox of the story. It will leave you with many a question. Most of all- as the tragically redone version of Mad World plays- you'll be asking \\"Why?\\" <BR> Is Donnie a tragic hero? A messed up teen? Did any of it really happen to begin with? And what in the world is going on, anyway? Enjoy
B00003CXS4|4.0|This is a good movie that is at first a bit confusing as you get introduced to so many characters very quickly.  However, it is an interesting story with a couple of twists.  It is a movie you'll enjoy the first time around, but you probably aren't going to watch it again for a while.
B000094A6A|5.0|All I am looking for is the title to the song that snoop dog sings.....thanks
B00005JKDR|4.0|This movie is pretty good. My 10 year old loved it. But my 3 year old (who usually enjoys children's movies) found it boring and refused to watch more than 2 minutes. Monsters Inc is also a good movie if grandparents are coming or if you have another family visit you. It is entertaining for most age groups. Everyone over the age of 5 in my family thinks it's great.<BR>If you are buying this for some one over the age of 5, I highly recommend this movie.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|THE EVIL DEAD is a horror movie with virtually no plot, cheesy acting and obviously low-budget special effects. It's also a remarkably unique and visionary film that, thanks to Sam Raimi's skilled direction, ends up being a very effective experiment in terror. It starts off a bit slow (the real carnage doesn't begin until about halfway through) but soon finds its pace, alternating eerie quiet scenes with jarring action sequences. EVIL DEAD posits a pretty groovy way of killing off the zombies: chopping 'em up into as many pieces as possible. Yes folks, this movie is GORY. Those afraid of a little (OK a lot) of bloodshed had better steer clear. This is also the only entry in the series that was actually conceived as a \\"serious\\" horror film; the other two, while very clever and entertaining, are more in the comedy vein. With Halloween approaching as I write this, there may be no better time to do battle with THE EVIL DEAD.
0321127420|5.0|This is an excellent Patterns book for a mature audience, and is a must-have for software architects and designers. In my opinion, together with the GOF's &quot;Design Patterns&quot;, it stands out of the rest of the Patterns books, primarily because the patterns are real and are very clearly presented.<br />A reader with a moderate experience architecting and designing industrial strength software systems will find at least some of the patterns familiar. You may actually enjoy reading this sort of patterns even more than those that are new to you: finding the validation of your own observations and ideas, as well as learning about new flavors and variations from the  experience of others, can be a very satisfying process.<br />The book consist of two parts: The Narratives and The Patterns. The first part describes architectural patterns in general, their relationships, and the problems they help to solve. Here you will find chapters about layering, organization of domain logic, object-relational mapping, web presentation, system distribution strategies, etc. The second part is a collection of patterns with a similar organization.<br />Both parts of the book are written in a simple and clear narrative language. To get most value out of the book requires fluency in the UML; practically anyone with an object-oriented programming language experience will understand illustrative code snippets.<br />In short: if you want to learn the wealth of architectural ideas compiled by the experts from the real-world experience and not get bored along the way -- get this book.
0618001905|4.0|This is a very informative and moving history on a mostly forgotten low point (among many low points) of European colonialism. Tiny Belgium and its unhinged, ineffective monarch King Leopold yearned for an overseas colony. Leopold got his own fiefdom in the Congo Territory, and drained the area of its wealth and people, lining his own pockets in the process. Of course the Congo itself got none of the proceeds, and even the nation of Belgium itself got very little as Leopold hoarded the money for himself and lavished it on mistresses and cronies. During this period the Congo became one of the most gruesome places on earth, as a command economy of ivory and rubber harvesting led to the deaths of millions of native Africans and the torture and hardship of many more. Hochschild ably documents this gruesome history and brings much-needed praise to the worldwide movement to bring attention to the Congo tragedy, a humanitarian effort that was quite unique for its time.<br />In the process Hochschild also brings necessary attention to the mostly forgotten heroes of the movement, like the grass-roots British whistleblowers E.D. Morel and Roger Casement, and the remarkable black American activists William Sheppard and George Washington Williams. However, in several places the author's historical research becomes bogged down in attempted character sketches of all the figures mentioned above, while the tail end of the book unloads a lot of guilt-tripping about how the world should remember the victims of this and other holocausts. This is already plainly evident to the reader, so such appeals just become tiresome. Another issue is Hochschild's frequent over-analysis of the book \\"Heart of Darkness\\" by Joseph Conrad, which was a fictionalized eyewitness account of these atrocities. But despite those weaknesses, this is still a moving account of the worst crimes of colonialism and their continuing effects on world history.
6305327084|5.0|I really liked this movie..I liked the realism, and I could identify with the characters...I also liked the setting and the dialog. I was planning on buying this dvd until I saw the cover. They put Rosie Odonnel on the cover. Stupid mistake on their part. I will never buy a movie that has Rosie on the cover. She is a big, fat, no-talent that I can not stand to look at.
B00006J3WH|5.0|I have friends who objected to this episode because the actors weren't  all top-notch singers.  Yet, as a writer, I can't help feeling that Joss Whedon, genius, worked that into the plot. He, as writer/producer, had a problem: almost a dozen characters who weren't talking to each other about critical issues:  love, betrayal, ressurection from the dead--like that.  How did he handle it?  A Convenient Demon who made people  sing what they felt (played, sung, danced, by the brilliant Hinton Battle).<br />The genius of Joss Whedon is in the interweaving melodies and harmonies of the different characters with similar solutions, the tremendous compassion the characters have for each other, and the musical talent of Whedon, who wrote everything, and Christopher Beck and Jesse Tobias, who arranged the songs for the actors' voices.<br />The lyrics (by Whedon) are an inspiration for anyone who has lived in shadows, metaphorical, social, or literal.  The tale of redemption (everything Whedon does is about redemption) gives strength to the tired and hope to the burnt-out.<br />Buy it.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead's third album &quot;Ok Computer&quot; was both a critical hit and a big seller being raved as the best album of the ninteties.  Although I wouldn't go that far, this album is refreshing from all the clichéd pop/rock &quot;I love you baby&quot; type songs.  The lyrics to these catchy songs are very strange yet beautiful and meaningful.  Just listen to &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; (which in my opinion is Ok Computer's best song) the haunting beautiful intoxicating melody with Thom Yorke's beautiful voice which is what Radiohead is all about.  Radiohead is truely a greatly talented band which is truely refreshing from your average screaming metal band.  Ok Computer is about machines and technology ruining the human way of life and the disturbing sense of the dark side of society.  This album is highly reccomended to any alternative rock fan.  The tracks include:<br />Airbag  <BR>Paranoid Android                                           Subterranean Homesick Alien  <BR>Exit Music (For A Film)    <BR>Let Down   <BR>Karma Police        <BR>Fitter Happier        <BR>Electioneering        <BR>Climbing Up The Walls        <BR>No Surprises        <BR>Lucky        <BR>Tourist, The<br />THis album is a great introduction to Radiohead.  This is definetly one of the best rock albums of the nineties and Radiohead's best.  A definite must-buy!
B00008PX8P|5.0|For us old Led Heads who thought we'd seen and heard the last of the greatest band ever, this DVD (and CD, How the West Was Won), was heaven-sent.  All of the kudos listed above are right on.  The &quot;Supershow&quot; bit, however, is more hilarious than musically rewarding.  With the audience that looks much like a PTL crowd on Sunday morning, the whole seen looks like it was lifted from &quot;This is Spinal Tap.&quot;
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Even though I bought the DVD after reading numerous good reviews about the film, my expectations remained low because it stated on the backcover of the DVD that the film is similar to Final Destination and Stir of Echoes.<br />I pop the DVD into my player and two hours later, I have to pick up my jaw from the floor! Do not believe what is stated on the backcover of the DVD! This film is awesome! It contains an original plot, greating casting and hauntingly beautiful music. It is high on my list of all time favourites with Lord of the Rings, The Matrix (first movie, Reloaded is dissappointing), Gattaca, Sleepy Hollow and From Hell. <br />This movie deserves a wider audience. Spread the word or buy it as a gift for your friends and relatives. For the sake of great movie-making and beautiful music-writing! It is so good that I feel sorry for director Richard Kelly. Because with such an astonishing debut, how is he going to top this one! I just hope that I am wrong.....
0962477060|5.0|Unlike a lot of other guitar books that begin to teach you complicated sequences without proper foundations.  This book will give you a structured learning experience, and a much easier time learning chords, scales, and arpeggios.  I recommended you buy this and read and re-read it since you will always get something new out of it everytime.  Heads above all redundant chord/scale books Ive seen.

B00008S2VG|4.0|I'm a big fan of Madonna, probably cuz she has an incredible voice!  There are many good songs in this album, and as her last album (Music) she used some electronic vocal effects in this one too.    The songs I liked include:  1. American Life - though she used the F & S words!  2. Love profusion. touchy lyrics.  3. Nobody knows me.  4. Nathing fails: one of my favorite songs.  5. Intervention.  6. Die another day: suits the Movie of James Bond.  7. Easy Ride. Great song.    Songs which I did not like much:  1. Hollywood. Didn't like the video-clip.   2. I'm So Stupid: I don't know why she thinks everybody is stupid !  3. X-static process.  4. Mother And Father.
B00005JLD2|5.0|the director phillip noyce thinks that everlyn sampi could be the next nichole kidman. i completely agree. she's got charm for days.and then some. what i thought was interesting was how she had to memorize her lines by having it read to her because of her limited reading skills, so its almost as though she was living the movie and not acting. people need to get hip to her so she can get more gigs. you know how hard it is for non whites in hollywood.
B00008LDPU|5.0|\\"The Animatrix\\" is a collection of nine short films that tie into the Matrix trilogy and fill in the gaps that are not further explored in the movies.<br />1) Final Flight of the Osiris- The story ties in \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\", which tells about how the machines are digging into Zion. My most favorite out of the nine short films and amazingly stunning to watch with incredible animation from Square USA Pictures.<br />2) The Second Renaissance Part 1 & 2- A two-part story of how the war between man and the machines began. Not my favorite to watch due to some disturbing images but a good film.<br />3) Kid's Story- The story tells about a kid who is being chased by Agents due to a message he received from Neo to enter the real world. Also one of my favorites and a good film to watch.<br />4) Program- The story about a girl in a training program who must make the choice between love and death. The most Japanese anime style film out of \\"The Animatrix\\" and also one of my favorite.<br />5) World Record- The story about a runner who discovers he's in the Matrix by making a world record. This film has a new style of anime and is somewhat confusing, but enjoyable to watch.<br />6) Beyond- The story about a girl who discovers a bug in the Martix. Fun to watch but not my favorite.<br />7) A Detective Story- The story about a detective who is assigned to find a hacker named Trinity. A little disappointing but the film has a cool style to it and great animation.<br />8) Matriculated- The story about how humans try to reprogram a machine and turn them on their side. The film has cool visuals and interesting animation. Although the ending isn't that great, the film is worth watching.<br />Overall, \\"The Animatrix\\" is good to buy. If you like Japanese anime, you'll like it. And if you love \\"The Matrix\\", you'll love this.
B000069AUI|1.0|This cd is BAD. From the Horrible intro song &quot;Politik&quot; to the over played &quot;Clocks&quot; to the boring &quot;Amsterdam&quot; this album is absolutly auful. It is slow and predictable. Music you fall asleep to. And the singing is soooooooooo bad, you know the people on American Idle, the people who get kicked out in the first round? They sing better than Coldplay's lead singer does. Another thing, you can barley hear the guitars! They might have not even put in guitars and you would never know. This cd makes me want to puke.
B000002KBD|4.0|Domino is the catchy slice of soulful pop that opens this great album. Crazy Face has gorgeous organ and I love the rockabilly rhythm and catchy melody of Give Me A Kiss. I've Been Working is an impressive funk workout that actually reminds me of the sound of James Brown; it's awash in exquisite sax and organ. The rousing Call Me Up In Dreamland sounds more like country-soul to me and here again the sax is the hero. Van goes into torch song mode for the brooding I'll Be Your Lover Too. One of the highlights of the album is the brilliant Blue Money with its catchy tune, hypnotic chorus and bubbling beat. (The obscure singer Cristina did a marvellous cover of Blue Money on her now out-of-print album Sleep It Off that appeared on Ze Records in the 1980s). Overall, His Band And The Street Choir is a wonderful showcase of Morrison's delightful take on various R&amp;B styles. Measured against masterpieces like Moondance, Tupelo Honey and Hymns To The Silence, it's not amongst his absolute best, but by any other standard it's a great work that will amply reward the listener.
B000092ZYX|5.0|This album is absolutely incredible. It combines the best of &quot;OK Computer&quot; with the new elctronic sounds of &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac.&quot; For those who were looking for a OK 2 you will be disapointed with HTTT but if thats the only expectations you have for this band then you should probably find somthing else to listen too. Radiohead brings us a beautiful album with beautiful lyrics and music to back it up. We could'nt have asked for anything more.
B000001IQH|5.0|Rancid are a revolutionary punk band bringing a mix of pop, hardcore and ska tracks through there 5 albums to date. It is on ..and out come the wolves that we see a great selection from all there music styles, ranging from the more poppy ruby soho, to the more hard hittin tracks like as wicked. Lars's vocals are at there best on this album, coupled with Tim Armstrong's highly original sound. All together this album is one of the greatest punk albums ive heard to date and should be a part of any true punk fans collection
B00008S2VG|5.0|The nay-sayers are just some of Star Search contest winner Kelly Clarkson's tone-deaf fans apparently. This album may not be Madonna's best album (&quot;Ray of Light&quot; is) but it certainly isn't a bad record by any means. I think it is just an example of how her desire to be fresh and innovative puts some off at first listen. She is really one step ahead of them and many of the tracks here tend to grow on you after repeat listenings. Every track here has a either a funky edge to it (&quot;Nobody Knows Me&quot;, Mother and Father&quot;) or is one of the Madonna's trademark pop confections (&quot;Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Love Profusion&quot;). Give it a spin!
0871137380|5.0|The battle of the Black Sea, took place on my 9th birthday.  What got me interested in the book was seeing a documentary on it a while ago on the History channel.  I saw the movie and then decided to see how the book compared and it was amazing.  After reading war documenteries such as &quot;Band of Brothers,&quot; i had very high hopes for what Black Hawk Down should be and it meet everyone of them.  Bowden gives a good spectrum of views whether it be from Rangers, D-Boys, or Somali Teenagers grabbing their AK-47's to join the fight.  I stayed up many nights just to read a few more pages.  Another thing that i liked about the book was the way that it was broken up into many subchapters.  This allowed the reader to pick it up for a few minutes, put it down, and not feel the need to re-read.  When someone reviews this book they need to realize that the author did not fabricate the story for the enjoyment of the reader.  Black Hawk Down is in tribute to the actions of the United State's finest on october 4rd, 1993.  Especially touching is the passage from Shakespear's Henry V that is read during the memorial service.  If you liked the movie, read the book.  If you are any sort of fan of history, read it.  If you have no idea what &quot;the battle of the Black Sea&quot; is, read it twice.
B000000WA4|4.0|Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness. Probably the most talked of album by the Smashing Pumpkins except maybe Siamese Dream.<BR>This epic 28 track 2CD album is in my opinion a great album.<BR>The first CD starts off with a nice instrumental piano song before slapping an emotional gem in your face..*tonight, tonight*<BR>The main tracks on this first CD are without a doubt: Tonight, tonight, Zero and Bullet With Butterfly Wings on first listen. Tonight, tonight and Bullet with butterfly wings are the pop-rock typical Corgan emotional almost ballads, While Zero is a much heavier, distorted sound that all will love. <BR>But listen closer to the CD and you'll find more songs which after the first listen are great.. Here Is No Why, Love, Muzzle and Jellybelly are great tracks. With the others mostly ballads that sound nice as well.<BR>On the second CD, the song everyone should know would be 1979, which is the most recognisable of the CD. The first two tracks are great also. Both heavy, distorted songs that would have you chanting 'love is suicide' for a long time. These two are probably my favourite. XYU is another cool song, strangely styled and almost like the first two tracks. Stumbeline is a nice short, spanishy feeling song and 'we only come out at night' is a wierd, bouncy song that is rather puzzling. I'm not saying this album is perfect, it could definitely drop a few songs.. it's a touch too long. The last tracks on both CD's (co-wrote with James Iha) are quite poor and 'Porcelina of the vast oceans, and 'cupid de locke' don't really live up to the rest of the album.<BR>But when all is said and done, thisis without a doubt an amazing album, andis highly recommended.
B00008J4P5|1.0|I rented this CD expecting music, the singer is wailing in soprano tones, the drumming is just a simple beat. These guys are the poorest excuse music ever to open for the Rolling Stones, luckily they weren't quite booed off stage. Whoever likes this is just into it because it's something new, not because it sounds good.
B0000041Q3|5.0|Ever since it's debut in 1972, this has been one of Decca's best selling operas. There is a very good reason for this. It has everything to make it superlative. It is also the people's choice for the definitive Turandot. It outsells its competitions by a landslide.<br />Turandot is not just an opera that Puccini wrote for the greatest singers in the world. It just happened that the three major roles in it are so difficult that only the most accomplished tenor and sopranos can even dare to attempt them. And I dare say that the team of Sutherland, Pavarotti, and Caballe more than meet the challenges of Puccini's vocal obstacles. In my opinion, all three of the major singers in this Mehta Turandots outsing its competition of Nilsson/Corelli/Scotto, and even the Nilsson/Corelli/Scotto. <br />But without a great conductor and orchestra, Turandot would just be another opera with catchy tunes. Here we have Mehta and the LPO, just how much better can you get than that?<br />And finally, the other great Turandots, namely the ones with Nilsson/Bjoeling/Tebaldi, and Nilsson/Corelli/Scotto can not touch the spectacular sound that the talented engineers of Decca has done. An operatic recording with audiophile sonics that sounds like you are in the action. The choruses are more rousing, the climaxes are more powerful, and from the softest notes to the loudest fortissimi, the sound that comes out of your speakers are simply breathtaking. With the other Turandots, especially the Nilsson/Bjoeling, you get static, tape noise, and no dynamics.<br />With credentials like that, how can the other Turandots compete?<BR>Trust me, this Turandot is sublime.
B000077VR3|1.0|Or pet your dog. Or go for a walk in the park. This film is atrociously bad. Why? It is unoriginal, obnoxious, heavy handed, unintelligent, bombastic and proud of it. What is good about it? It is exuberant, colorful and Nicole Kidman is attractive. But that's it. I will send a blast e-mail to my friends informing them that this is the worst film that I have ever seen. Unfortunately, it does not fall under the rubric of being so bad that it's good. Instead, this movie is so bad that it stinks. My epitaph could say that I was the &quot;anti Moulin Rouge.&quot; If you truly believe that this is a 5-star movie I think you either have been suckered by those who heap unjustified praise on this or you simply have poor taste in film. This movie proves to me conclusively that Hollywood hype can dupe most people. I used to defend Joe Sixpack, saying that the Average American is often underestimated. And that the reason for that is due to an aggressive arrogance exhibited by the white collar crowd. Sadly, this film has made me conclude that most people are indeed sheep and that with the proper stimuli they can be led to do or believe virtually anything.
630197154X|4.0|This is undoubtedly an excellent film, but to me it always brings to mind and seems exploitative of the incident which occurred in Sarasota, FL in July 1974, in which WXLT-TV channel 40 newswoman Chris Chubbuck, 29, announced, \\"In keeping with Channel 40's policy of always bringing you the latest in blood and guts, in living color, you're about to see another first -- an attempted suicide.\\" And then she shot herself on live tv, on her program \\"Suncoast Digest\\". I have always thought part of \\"Network\\" was inspired by this tragic tale.
B000002KHH|5.0|While certainly a great achievement in rock, this album is by no means the best Sabbath work-- in fact any other selection from the first 6 albums might even have the edge. Of course, several of the bands more `popular' numbers appear here-- songs such as War Pigs, Iron Man and War Pigs which would go on to be performed over and over by Black Sabbath (with or without Ozzy Osbourne) and also by Ozzy himself.  I believe that War Pigs also became a live favourite for Faith No More...<br />For me, the best song on this album is Hand of Doom. It is sad that most of you out there have overlooked this one-- one thing that Sabbath did well was to cram two or three different songs into a single track and Hand of Doom is a great example. Also, it is a much simpler track which showcases Ozzy's voice more than anything else-- Ozzy has a great rock voice and it is always a thrill to hear him cut loose like he does here.<br />Also, may of you out there have panned planet caravan saying that Ozzy's voice sounds weird... it is not, of course, Ozzy singing...<br />Overall, I  rate this a 5/5 and believe everyone should own it. If you don't own any Sabbath then this is probably also the most accessible of the albums providing as close as you could get to a `pop' song with the title track (which was Sabbath's first and only no. 1 single and has appeared on every rock compilation in existence). For the braver listeners out there, try Sabotage instead, or even the debut Black Sabbath.
B00000K19E|5.0|Good Story Line...Good special effects...and just simply one of the best movies of all time. No DVD collection should be without it
B000092ZYX|4.0|I've been a Radiohead fan for almost two years now and what I have learned is that after a first listening, you can't expect to come away from a Radiohead album and feel completely secure that your opinion of it will remain unchanged.  This always seems to occur with me  so when I came to approach this one I did so under the conviction that I would \\"give it time\\" before I wrote up a review on Amazon. I prefer to characterize this phenomena as a direct result of the subtle sophistication of their music. It requires a several listenings before you can fully appreciate it in its entirety. <br /> In the New Yorker a review read: \\"Kid A and Amnesiac are the thesis. The Bends and OK Computer are the antithesis, and Hail to the Thief is the synthesis, though it's much closer to the last two than any of the \\"rock\\" albums.\\" I partially agree with this analysis but I would rather say that The Bends and Heil to the Thief are the antithesis and Ok Computer is the synthesis. I say that because I think that on the continuum-- if there can be such a thing --of genre, \\"Ok Computer\\" is closer to Rock than \\"Hail to the Thief.\\" <br /> What makes this album more like \\"Ok Computer\\" and less like \\"The Bends\\" is that the lyrics have remained eccentrically impersonal. If you don't agree with me compare \\"Pablo Honey\\" to this release. I also think the sound has evolved as well. If it weren't for Yorke's signature voice you'd wonder if it were the same band, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Just different. <br /> When the album kicks off with \\"2 + 2 = 5\\" you think that they've returned to their Ok Computer style of rock but when you arrive at the shores of space and \\"Sail to the Moon\\" their album begins to sound more like Amnesiac, but then not really. It seems that Hail To the Thief is strewn with different styles of sound and tempo and this dynamic texture of musical composition is what really makes this album so powerful. <br /> My favorite songs on this record would have to be \\"2 + 2= 5,\\" \\"We suck Young Blood,\\" \\"The Gloaming,\\" \\"There, There,\\" and \\"A Wolf at the Door\\" (The eccentricity of the lyrics are my style. So surrealist with a tint of pretense).<br /> I didn't rate this album in the shadow of \\"Ok Computer\\" because I feel that each of their records are so complex and different that they deserve to be considered independent of one another. I gave this a four star instead of five because I tend to prefer more rock and less \\"electronic\\" but overall I think this album is probably one of the best records put out this year by and group.

B000059ZLH|4.0|I've been a fan of Dream Theater since Pull me under was a hit back in the day.  Actually, I wasn't even aware that they were still around until I heard &quot;Big Medley&quot; on a &quot;guess-who-this-band-is&quot; contest in May of '03.  My guess was DT, but the lack of a phone number prevented me from winning the contest.<br />   Since then I've attained most of their live releases.  It's very refreshing hearing intelligent lyrics backed up by outstanding musicianship.  That is EXTREMELY rare in today's musical universe.<br />   This DVD was the first time I've actually seen DT in-the-flesh.  The musicianship is outstanding, and the overall performance is amazing.  The only thing that prevented a 5 star review was the annoying visual effects.  The split screen/ upside-down screen/ reverse video/ lyric enactments / DT logo overlays are more appropriate in a late '60's music video.  If I wanted to see that I'd tune VH1-CR on my cable box.<br />   I would highly recommend this DVD to DT fans.  I would recommend this to non DT fans as well, but I'd ask that they not let the cheesy effects cloud their appreciation of the music.
0142004235|5.0|I'm so pleased Oprah chose this book.  I feel it's overshadowed by \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" yet so much more powerful.  Take the time to get through the first part of the book about the history of the land and region where the book takes place -- it's well worth it to get to the meat of the story.  The story follows generations of a family repeating the same cycle of hurt and betrayal parallel to the story of Cain and Abel in the Bible   (you only need a cursory knowledge of the biblical story to understand).  It's a gripping story, but the message of the book is all about personal choice, how life may throw us curve balls but it is up to us individually to decide how we cope and CHOOSE to live.  I read this book almost 20 years ago and it changed the way I view life.  More than anything, this book is very empowering and challenges readers to be responsible for actions, or lack thereof, in their lives.
6300267997|4.0|The Classic James Mason and Judy Garland version of &quot;A Star Is Born will never be topped. And I don't believe that they tried to in 1976. A Star is Born in 1976 was an incredibly popular movie, and although it was shunned ,and skewered by the critics, it played in theatres for 6 months. So in the 21st Century you have to have the wisdom of watching this movie through a 1970's lens.  I ENJOY watching a rather young Barbra Streisand rocking out on the Finale-Watch Closely Now.
B000068QY7|4.0|Liam and Noel Gallagher, the two biggest rock star/alcoholics/chaos creators to come out of England in the 90s started with nothing and now have grown to be the biggest band in all of the U.K. After smash hits like &quot;Live Forever&quot; &quot;Cigarettes &amp; Alcohol&quot; &quot;Wonderwall&quot; &quot;Champenge Supernova&quot; and &quot;Stand By Me&quot; they're releasing their 5th studio album. While the Gallaghers are the only remaining founding members of the band they sound better than ever. Up until their fourth cd &quot;Standing on the Shoulder of Giants&quot; Noel had been the sole songwriter. Once Liam had gotten his song Little James on SOTSOG Noel got a break. On Heathen Chemistry Noel contributes a mere 6 songs while his little brother Liam throws in 3 of his own and newer members Gem Archer and Andy Bell each add a song of their own. Heathen Chemistry introduces some smash songs that Oasis hasn't had since 1996's &quot;What's the Story (Morning Glory).&quot; The opening track &quot;The Hindu Times&quot; has as much soul and power as all of Morning Glory and more. The album shines on Liam's best songwriting work, the two minute two chord &quot;Songbird&quot; and more of Noel's unstoppable songwriting style with &quot;Stop Crying Your Heart Out&quot; and &quot;Little By Little.&quot; Heathen Chemistry is probably Oasis' best work since their debut &quot;Defenitaly Maybe.&quot; 8/10 Highlights: &quot;The Hindu Times&quot; &quot;Stop Crying Your Heart Out&quot; &quot;Songbird&quot; &quot;Little By Little&quot; &quot;She is Love&quot;

B000002C25|4.0|It's got to be hard to make a follow-up album to the mutli-platnum success of Oasis' sophmoric triumph &quot;What's The Story (Morning Glory).&quot; As far as most fans and critics are concerned they biffed on their third cd &quot;Be Here Now.&quot; But to the untrained ear this album sounds like dribble and weak attempts at conquering success demands. However this is their most psychadelic and smoothest album. From beginning to end it flows like the English Channel from the opening rock 'n' roll anthem &quot;D'You Know What I Mean?&quot; to the reprise of one of their best songs &quot;All Around The World.&quot; Sure it doesn't have smash hits like &quot;Wonderwall&quot; or &quot;Supersonic&quot; but there isn't one song on this record that feels like it doesn't belong and doesn't compliment the next or previous song. Just take a peak at &quot;Stand By Me&quot; or &quot;Don't Go Away&quot; and you should be sold. 8/10 Highlights: &quot;Stand By Me&quot; &quot;Don't Go Away&quot; &quot;D'You Know What I Mean?&quot; &quot;All Around The World&quot; &quot;The Girl In The Dirty Shirt&quot;
B00003W8NM|5.0|In its most condensed form, Fight Club is about the confliction between conformity--the pressure to conform to a material addicted society -- and nonconformity--the defiant nature of the inner and much suppressed anarchist within all of us.  The movie is a tour guide through the darkest aspects of nature. It has a dismal overtone throughout that is distrusting and depressing at times but all the while, brutally true. It is witty and cynical in a way that you will find yourself laughing at things that should never be humorous. Palahniuk has a artistic way of nearly overdoing things at times.

During his breakdown he becomes aquainted with his previously dormant alter-ego, Tyler, who is the absolute opposite of himself. As Jack decends into madness, his vulnerability allows his alter-ego to slowly consume him. By the time Tyler becomes the prevalent personality, Jack emerges only from time-to-time to find himself feeling confused and abandoned.

The dialog is interesting, fluid, witty and intellectually stimulating.  All in all, its master piece. When you think it can't possibly get more weird, suddenly there is a twist of a twist of a twist and you find your brain in a knot of perplexity. It masterfully sustains suspense till the very end.

0688163173|1.0|I was drawn to this book by the raves for Mystic River.  Now I'm wondering whether I should bother reading that one.  Shutter Island reminds me why I don't read thrillers, even by so-called &quot;literary&quot; authors like Lehane.  This book is filled with cardboard characters, spouting cliched dialogue in implausible situations.  I grew tired of Lehane stringing bits of action together with sentences in which one &quot;and&quot; followed the next to give the reader the impression that something really was happening.  The twist at the end left me saying little more than, &quot;Huh?&quot;  Unfortunately, I don't care enough about the characters to go back through the book and figure out how it all came together.  If you're looking for something to occupy you on a long plane ride, this book will fit the bill, but if you're a serious reader aware of some of the fine contemporary literature that's available today, I'll bet you'll be angry at yourself for getting suckered into wasting a few hours on this novel.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|The only band that matters?  Not quite, but at the time it seemed like it.  This album was a revelation at the time of it's release, and it still holds up today.  The band plays it's brand of reggae influenced punk for over an hour, and virtually all of it is great.  This is the greatest long form punk album of all time, and it's a must get for all fans of the genre.
0393057658|5.0|I'm a \\"baseball dad\\" with both a 15-year-old son who plays HS baseball and a 7-year-old grandson who plays little league.  I keep the scorebook and the stats for all my son's games and have been doing so for the last 5 years.  One of the other baseball dad's recommended this book to me and said I would like it.  So based on his recommendation I bought the book yesterday.<br />This book is terrific.  It's an easy read.  But more importantly, it gives you an inside look at the MLB draft through the eye's of the Oakland A's.  It's a tale of two schools of thought - the old way of selecting players based on scouting reports vs the new way of selecting players based on stats - but not just any stats.  And the book provides some interesting background on the stats of yesteryear and today.  For example, everyone thinks the batting average is one of the greatest indicators of success - but this book points out it is really OBP and SLG, not AVG that is the best indicator of runs.<br />If you like baseball, you are really going to savor and enjoy the inside look at the draft, scouts, and a lively discussion of old school vs new school with regard on how best to select players on a low budget.<br />Run, don't walk, to buy this book.  2 thumbs up!
B00006IU73|4.0|In general I like this CD. Although it has some slow moments, it has a lot of great hooks that keep you coming back. This is my first PT CD, and they kind remind me of a cross between Rush and Pink Floyd, if that makes any sense.
B00008CQS0|4.0|I enjoyed the Goodbye Lenin soundtrack, but Run Lola Run was directed by Tom Tykwer.
038572179X|2.0|Atonement has been described as a \\"symphonic novel.\\"  This is due to the fact that the novel has four parts, as a symphony has four movements; Atonement is not a novel of any great lyrical quality.  It is one of the few works that I have read, that managed to raise expectations and suspense to a high level, and then not remotely deliver.  In the engrossing Part 1, our heroine Briony sees her sister (Cecilia) and her family's servant (Robbie) in some overtly sexual situations.  She secretly loves Robbie so this makes her upset, and she decides to get revenge.  When Briony's cousin, Lola, is attacked later that day, Briony pins the blame on Robbie, and he is shipped off to prison.  Predictably, Briony will now atone for her wrongs.  But Part 2 begins, and with no transition whatsoever, the reader is whisked off to World War II, and the British Army's retreat from Dunkirk.  Robbie is no longer in prison, he is in the army.  Then, predictably he retreats and goes home to England.  Part 3: Briony is now a nurse and she treats wounded soldiers.  At the end of Part 3 she meets up with Cecilia and Robbie and tells them that she will atone for her wrongs.  Then Part 3 ends.  Part 4 begins 60 years later, in the present day.  Briony is old and muses about how she has never atoned for what she died.  She has written a book called, you guessed it, Atonement, in which she atones, but she has never published this book.<br />Part 1 of Atonement showed great promise.  It was tautly written, and ended with suspense.  How was Briony going to deal with what she had done?  However, in the remaining 3 parts, this fundamental question is never answered!  The final 3 parts skip around to different locales and seem to be different novels sharing the same characters.  They bear no resemblance to the themes in Part 1.  After raising my expectations to a high level, Atonement did not deliver.  It likely has the least-fulfilling conclusion, and resolution that I have ever seen in a novel.  Don't come to Atonement expecting a plot dealing with atonement, because the plot doesn't deal with it.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. I watch it with my nana all the time. I am only in my early 20's and i have enjoyed this since I was 8. It is a delightful musical that captures your heart. It take you through the season of the year and you can watch thier lives unfold and the magic that they capture on screen. Even if your not into classical movies this one is amazing and I'm sure you'll enjoy it too.
0688170528|4.0|I bought The Pact looking for a good read, and was not disappointed. I could not put it down. Picoult's writing was strong, fast paced, and the ideas in the story were very intriguing to me... how well do any of us ever know our children? How do events that happened earlier shape our lives? How close can two people be?<br />The only drawback which made it not suitable for my book club is the themes dealing with sex and a tad bit of language. I thought these themes were very well done, and true to life, but was very surprised to find them in the book, as the back cover blurb said nothing about them. If you can see the value of some scenes of that nature, to express a point, develop a character, etc... than I could reccommend this book with a clear conscience. If you prefer not to read things of that nature, I'd pass this one up...
B00001ODHJ|4.0|While Army of Darkness is a very worthy sequel to Evil Dead II, it's also a very different movie. Where Evil Dead II was a comedy horror, Army of Darkness is more of an action comedy with a horror theme. However, it's an extremely good action comedy.<br />Bruce Campbell yet again hits his mark perfectly. This time he's not simply trying to survive; He's a war tested vet of evil and quite ticked off about it. He takes care of the dead with a gleam in his eye and spouts off one liners that would even make Arnold Schwarzenegger take notice.<br />The only flaw in this otherwise wonderful flick is probably the big battle. It's just too drawn out and fake, but this isn't exactly Lord of the Rings after all. It's not too bad really and the original ending caps things off with absolute perfection. This movie has by far the best ending scene and line I've ever heard in a movie.<br />- Rirath.com

B00005JHAB|1.0|I don't think JLo is a good actress.  Loved her in Selena, but that's all.  This movie reeked b/c what I thought was gonna happen did.  <br />Now My Best Friend's Wedding was a great film
B00005JLXE|4.0|Daredevil really surprised me. I expected nothing more than a cheap comic turned movie, what I got was a lot more. The movie is much darker than I expected and the acting is spot on. I absolutely love the darkness of this film and it really helps it stand apart from the crowd.<br />Ben Affleck, Colin Farrell, and Michael Clarke Duncan all give wonderful performances that play on the characters perfectly. The only blemish is perhaps Jennifer Garner's character. She seemed kinda out of place in nearly every action scene. She did a fine job in the more sentimental scenes though, with feeling but without making it overpowering or sappy.<br />Her story of training under a different master every year is pathetic and the brief woman power non-victim speeches are kinda ridiculous. There's also a brief rage scene where the character seemed all but blind to the situation around her. She serves her purpose rather nicely in the film though, and it had me cheering they had the guts to write the role and the story right.<br />All in all this is a great superhero action flick with a darker side. Leaps and bounds above the horrible ranks of Spawn, yet not quite as good as X-Men. I'd say the darker, more realistic story and the lack of anything truly corny puts it slightly above Spiderman.<br />- Rirath_com
B00008MNYS|5.0|Okay, in my previous review I had said that there were only two incredible songs on Escapology.  I have to admit that I went back to listen to it and realized that I was wrong.  I think that there are many incredible songs on this CD, including \\"Feel\\", \\"Sexed Up\\", \\"Something Beautiful\\", \\"Revolution\\", \\"Me and My Monkey\\", and \\"Nan's Song\\".  I kind of like \\"Love Somebody\\" and \\"The World's Most Handsome Man\\", but I'm not totally convinced.  The first one of these two begins great, but then it becomes sort of dark and bitter.  The second one of these two sounds a bit like today's alternative sound, which I don't like very much.   I've been thinking it could be liked in the U.S.  I think that this CD combines some brilliant writing and humor; two of Robbie's qualities that I admire and appreciate very much.  \\"Dear God, would you please make Americans see Robbie's amazing talent?\\"
6305841861|5.0|Lately I've been craving to find a truly good horror film, and with Evil Dead II, I've finally found it. If you're a comedy fan and even a casual fan of horror, you simply need to watch Evil Dead II. It's such a perfect mix of comedy and horror that you just can't go wrong. I haven't jumped so many times at a horror film in ages, and I've never laughed so hard at the same movie.<br />On the horror side of things, this movie is truly a horror film. I jumped and squirmed so many times I lost count. From start to finish it's filled with gore and disturbing creatures of all sorts. The effects may be cheesy by now, but it really doesn't matter. You'll take a sick pleasure in watching poor Ash scream in borderline insanity. Yet, it thankfully never crosses the line from dark fun all out sick. It's gruesome gore filled fun, but it stays on the right side of the fine line between fun and sick.<br />On the comedy side of things, Bruce Campbell has become a cult action comedy hero from this movie. You'll laugh so hard at his utter breakdowns of emotion you'll wonder what side your rooting as good and bad blur into smear of insanity. The laughing room scene cracked me up and freaked me out all at the same time, and Bruce never misses a beat of the hair trigger fun.<br />- Rirath_com
0790729725|5.0|I'll just point out right now that I'm going to spend more time reviewing the movie rather than the DVD features. As a DVD, this is really nothing special (it has no commentaries, featurettes, deleted scenes, or any of the other extras that have come to define what DVD is about), but it's worth owning just for the movie. \\"Goodfellas\\" is one of the few films that can be put out with no bonus materials and still be great. The movie alone is enough to warrant 5 stars. <br />Now that that's out of the way, onto my main point, this is one of the best movies ever made. In the 13 years since this movie came out, few other films have been made that rival the greatness of \\"Goodfellas\\". This is one movie that has, and will most likely continue to stand the test of time. <br />As you've probably heard, the movie is based on a novel (\\"Wiseguy\\") by Nicholas Pillegi. It follows the rise and fall of mafia soldier Henry Hill, from his mob beginnings in the 1950s, to his eventual demise in the 1970s. One of the key aspects of this film is that it portrays the mob in a more realistic fashion than a lot of other movies do. Some films depict mobsters as bloodthirsty criminals who live only to kill, but this movie manages to capture something that many others do not ; a mobster's job isn't to kill people, a mobster's job is to make money. The killing that they have become so well known for is just a small part of that. \\"Goodfellas\\" doesn't show it's characters as the inhuman killing machines that many crime movies do, instead the characters are shown to be fairly normal individuals. This is where a lot of the appeal lies in this movie. People like to see things shown in a new way, and that's exactly what this movie does. It shows that criminals aren't really all that different from any one else. Henry's wife, Karen, explains much of this in an excellent monologue about half way through the movie.<br />Some will say that this film glamorizes organized crime by showing all the perks of the criminal life; the money, the clothes, the cars, the respect, etc., but I think that in many ways this movie is actually very anti-crime. While Henry and his criminal cohorts do experience success, they ultimately pay the price for the lives they lived.<br />As for the cast of this movie, they're absolutely outstanding. Liotta gives one of the best performances of his carreer, and De Niro is excellent as usual. Paul Sorvino and Lorraine Bracco also turn in great work as supporting characters. As for Joe Pesci, he received a well deserved Academy Award for his performance. Watching the movie, you can really see the intensity Pesci provides as Tommy, Henry's maniac friend. Every time I watch this movie, I develop even more appreciation for Pesci's work. The direction is also spectacular. This is the movie that introduced me to Scorsese's work, and he's been my favorite director ever since. It's incredible to see the amount of work that he put into every frame of this movie. The stretch in the restaurant (I think it's the Copa Cabana) is some of the best photography I've ever seen.<br />This is one movie that is definitely worth owning on DVD. A lot of movies lose their effect the more you watch them, but it's been my experience that the more I watch this movie, the more impressed I am by it. I love it more with every viewing.
B00000IQC8|4.0|Clerks really took me by surprise. I've never been a Kevin Smith fan, so I figured this wouldn't be any different. Being a former electronics store \\"clerk\\", I figured the humor in this might appeal more. Clerks really stands apart, and is quite enjoyable. The dialog is actually intelligent and entertaining, not this pseudo-intellectual garbage going around in most movies. And I like how it never really goes too far.<br />None of the dialog is there just to be there, it's quite believable that these two guys would say all this. Maybe not in one day, but it's a film after all. Entertainment is more important than realism. For anyone who is still empty headed enough to think the clerks at your local store are just slack jawed idiots, this film should be a real eye opener. Kevin Smith himself was a clerk, and the movie was shot where he worked on a shoestring budget. He's also Silent Bob.<br />All in all, watch it at least once. Especially if you've ever been a Clerk.
B0000584V3|5.0|Words lack the power to provide this album with the praise it deserves. I am honestly at a loss for how to accurately describe this recording, but I'll do my best. All I can really say is that it's nothing short of astounding. This CD is, for lack of a better word, perfect. All work by this band is absolutely incredible. Better music has never been created. Opeth saved me from the god awful mallcore 'music' I thought was good prior to my introduction to real music. I can't even begin to describe how vast the gap between Opeth and most other bands is. Listening to this CD actually made me pity people who listen to mallcore. They have no idea what they're missing. Had I never come across this band, I would be an enormously different person. You have no idea how glad I am that I bought this CD.<br />At this point, you're probably doubting that music can have that significant of an effect on someone's life, but buy this CD and I promise you will understand what I'm talking about. You really have to hear this band to comprehend what this music is like. The acoustic, progressive music accompanied by Mikael's clean vocals is breath taking, and the attack of the ferocious death metal is something to remember as well. The amalgram of the two is one of the most creative ideas ever employed in the creation of music and something I would not be surprised to see other bands doing in the future. To hear a song start off with some vicious, ravaging death metal only to have it suddenly vanish to reveal a beautiful acoustic medley is something that one does not get to experience often. At first, I thought that I would find these transitions bothersome, but I now regard them as something I would like to hear more of. <br />I think that music fans who have an appreciation for many different genres will find \\"Blackwater Park\\" to be especially intriguing. Opeth combine many different musical styles and manage to prevent it from sounding awkward or out of place as though it were just interjected from out of nowhere. The arabic influence in the song \\"Bleak\\" fits amazingly well with Mikael's brutal death growls. The care that the band puts into designing the structure of their songs is evident through their ability to merge these many different types of music and create a style all their own.<br />As for the lyrics, they're astonishingly poetic. They seem to tell a story of some kind, although I haven't the depth to decipher it. Whether they are softly sung or venomously growled, they are truly amazing. They are extremely descriptive and can really transport you to the place that they describe. \\"Blackwater Park\\" and \\"Dirge for November\\" have especially magnificent lyrics.<br />The insrtumental work really shows off the talent of all the musicians. The guitar work is very complex and highly technical, not boring and repetetive like so many other bands that play the same power chords over and over again. The most amazing thing about the instrumental work is how well all the sounds merge together. It presents an incredibly united sound and everything just flows together very well.<br />I can not reccomend this CD strongly enough. Buying this CD was the best purchase of my life. I've never once regreted buying it. This CD has broadened my musical horizons more than any other I own. I urge you to buy this CD and I hope that it does as much for you as it has for me.
B00008PX8P|5.0|The goldmine of this set is the Albert Hall Concert.  What a revelation. It's simply amazing to experience a band that was only 2 years /albums old and already in greatness.  John Bonham is electrifying in action here, and Robert Plant's voice is HUGE.  Booming through the speakers.  Page is the silent virtuouso.  Playing beautiful notes.  This is an invincible band. What a shame Heartbreaker couldn't be included.<br />Most of all, one can see the popular reaction of the crowds to the band.  The band feels more like a pop / blues band than a &quot;rock&quot; outfit.  It's extremely fresh.<br />Disc 1 is also the &quot;Dazed And Confused&quot; disc - with multiple versions of the song.  The amusing Paris show where a crowd looks on at Page and Plant doing Dazed N Confused like they're madmen, and Communication Breakdown video are great historical oddities...they should have interviewed the directors.<br />And what's missing are interviews, but Led Zep always preferred to showcase the music.  Some onstage banter would've been fun as well.  I even enjoyed the DVD menu inserts with nice visuals showcasing the nostalgia of the whole release.<br />Highlights of Disc 2:  Immigrant Song gets a wonderful editing treatment.  Rock N Roll from Australia is super powerful.  The 4 songs from Madison Square Garden capture a band at its superstar peak.  The Earl's Court and Knebworth gigs capture a more serious side for me...<br />Agree that the newly edited &quot;inserts&quot; seem a bit off here and there in places, but I wondered if this was to cover up deteoriated film.<br />As a historical and musical document, I'm glad this has finally been released and went to # 1.  For people who haven't been converted...buy the albums then get this....I do feel there's room for more, like a remastered, complete concert version of The Song Remains the Same.  Doubt if we'll see it, but let's hope the archives are kept well....<br />There really should be more.  Let's hope the success of this release gives Jimmy Page an incentive to look around...is release gives Jimmy Page an incentive to look around...
B000002U82|5.0|This was what made Pink Floyd, it couldn't get any better. Even though this masterpiece is 30 years old I still think it is the most saticfying and &quot;beyond it's time&quot; album of all time. I,ve listened to the whole thing from start to finish over 100 times in 4 years. It has to me all of Floyd's best: Time, the solo is just aswome. Great Gig In The Sky, the best use of another singers voice that is not in the band ever. Money, what can I say? A pure Floyd Classic. And to me the greatest closeing song of any great album, Eclipse. Simpley the Greatest.
0385504209|3.0|I started the book and couldn't put it down. Around page 200 the book takes a turn. Dan Brown misstates several things as he weaves the story together. I have a degree in Theology and can read a wide range of thoughts, but when Dan Brown says things like &quot;YHWH was derived from Jehovah&quot; it is troublesome... since in fact, Jehovah was derived from YHWH by the Germans who had a hard time pronounching YHWH. - the exact opposite! Dan Brown wrote a page turner - but unless you have an academic background in theology or church history, you could easily mistake his fiction for fact... be careful not to believe this book.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This movie is fantastic! My two year old will not leave the room until the entire movie is over. He absolutely loves it, and my brother (age 31) loves it, although he won't admit it. It has everything a family wants in a movie. The story, the characters, the art, its all there. I am in awe of the disney pixar studios. they really know how to entertain everyone from age 2 to 200.
0684801558|3.0|This book really wasn't that great.  It was slow and hard to get into.  Many incidences were repetitive and the book was a whole lot of nothing.  The ending was a let down, and I grew to have a strong feeling of contempt for many of the characters.  If you like Fitzgerald, stick with the Great Gatsby or Tender is the Night.  Otherwise you'll find reading this book is boring and you'll be damned to want to finish it.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Much has been made about the weirdness &amp; unlistenable nature of this album.  Had this been Radiohead nobody would have 2nd thoughts about this album.  Like Radiohead, the sonic landscape &amp; textures add to the music &amp; is not in place of the music.  While there is the odd bleep, whirr, &amp; drone, the songs are all strong in their lyric content &amp; musicality.  <br />Tweedy &amp; Co. have replaced the pop sensibility of the Beach Boys from Summerteeth &amp; have written their own Rubbersoul.  As Rubbersoul was the Beatles breakthrough from 60's pop to their transcending pscyedelic period.  YHF is Wilco's damnation of their alt-country roots.  <br />What makes YHF so special is the actual lack of playing on the album.  While Summerteeth was dense and cluttered, YHF is economical by comparision.  It was also like they were being charged by the note.  Guitars are strummed instead of plucked &amp; shredded.  Keyboards are sparse and played in single notes.  Drums are muted and offbeat at times.  <br />YHF was recorded before 911 but the themes are haunting in expressing the feelings of sadness &amp; aloneness that everybody felt afterwards.  From the alcoholic melancoly of the opening track to the outright despair of Ashes of American Flags, the contrasting views of love and cynicism of American life shows through.  Kamera and War on War are straight ahead rock tunes with the volume turned down &amp; the emotion turned up.  <br />The album is not all doom &amp; gloom.  I'm the man who loves you and Heavy Metal Drummer exalt the good times kind of vibe of old roots revival bands.<br />YHF is complex in nature.  The Backstreet Boys Wilco is not.  YHF is less direct and accessible than Being There &amp; Summerteeth.  But like the Beach Boy's Pet Sounds there is genuine beauty and emotion that shines through.  Maybe in 20 years YHF will be talked about with the same kind of reverence.  Lets just hope Jeff Tweedy doesn't go off on a Twinkee binge.
B00004W5UA|5.0|This is bold, bruising humor alright! At first, I didn't really know what the VHS box was talking about in its description of Jack being a ticking-time bomb insomniac until I finished watching the movie. It's a bit complex to explain anything about this movie since it's one of those psychological comedies. The movie stars Edward Norton (one of my current favorite actors) and Brad Pitt as well as Helena Bonham Carter, Jared Leto and Meat Loaf. The flick starts off with Edward Norton who plays simply the \\"narrator\\" but hinted with the notification of Jack as he sits on a chair with a gun in his mouth pointed by Brad Pitt who plays Tyler Durden. You are then taken moments and perhaps days before what had led up to the circumstances. Jack is an insomniac who is looking to decorate his condo with new furniture and home designs to maybe reshape his depression. He starts attending sessions for those who need the same help as him but ends up sprawling back into depression and insomnia when a fake cancer victim steps into the picture. Eventually things get out of hand for Jack and things aren't as they seem and you find out that he's actually \\"insane\\" lol with serious emotional problems. You'll have to watch this flick to understand what I'm saying. Jack and Tyler Durden are the same person but in different perspectives. Tyler is who Jack wants to be like and everything that Jack wants to be is Tyler Durden. Anyway, FIGHT CLUB is basically a club for males to release their anger and emotions as they channel primal male aggression beating each other senseless until one of them gives up or gets knocked out. The therapy shockingly works for Jack and the whole system is topped with rules. Through many zany moments, you will find yourself trapped in a maze of questions but everything will reveal itself slowly as the film proceeds to the mind-blowing climax. The bottomline is that this movie delivers no remorse with pure style. Booming with a soundtrack by the Dust Brothers and aconcept so worth picking the title up for. Both Edward Norton and Brad Pitt give terrific performances. My favorite scene has got to be when Jack beats himself up in front of his boss.<br />Rent this movie TODAY!!
B00008PX8P|5.0|This DVD is Zeps way of apologizing to all their fans for The Song Remains The Same.  The book included even eludes to that fact.<br />If you are a Zeppelin fan this is the DVD you have been waiting for.  It includes a glimpse into four periods of the bands life and some of their best performances.<br />The picture quality is excellent considering some of it is 30 years old.  The sound is excellent except a little static out of the center channel on the Dolby Digital 5.1 track.  DTS is excellent.  And the $22 price tag for 5 and a half hours of live Zeppelin footage can't be beat.<br />I've been playing this DVD for three weeks straight now and it's still wonderful.<br />I can't say enough about this DVD except a big thanks to Jimmy,<BR>I can only hope he held some stuff back so we can have another DVD soon.<br />If you're a Zeppelin fan then run, don't walk, to your nearest store and get this DVD, you won't be dissapointed.<br />If you're not a Zeppelin fan, get it anyway and you will be..

B00008NRI8|3.0|Sandra Bullock is one of the best-looking butt-of-the-joke movie comediennes in showbiz, and a savvy producer to boot: She's carved a respectable if not overwhelming niche in the romantic and dramatic comedy market by helming high-gloss, middle-brow, self-depreciating entertainments aimed at the easygoing set. Bullock is not as gifted as Reese Witherspoon  or as high-wattage as Julia Roberts, but, to use an adage of old folks across America, you could often do a lot worse.<br /> For \\"Two Weeks Notice\\" Bullock was able to drum up Hugh Grant to play opposite her romantic lead, which is a kind of testament to the credibility she's built for herself over time. Grant doesn't look particularly comfortable at times in the movie, especially during its second half, but he doesn't phone it in as he did in \\"Mickey Blue Eyes.\\" <br />Grant, as a playboy real estate mogul, and Bullock, as his long-suffering liberal lawyer, tap dance through the opposites-attract opening before Bullock offers her notice to quit, frustrated with her bosses' inability to commit to the importance of his work. A subtle rival (gorgeous Alicia Witt) arrives to take Bullock's place, and, as many of Bullock's movies do, Witt plays a type of smart, sexually subversive lass instead of the straight heavy. <br />That takes much of the wind out of the comedic sails of \\"Two Weeks Notice\\" while pressing the button of intricate female drama. Watch how, with great precision, the rivalry comes to head over a tiff on a particular piece of office equipment Bullock would like to take as a memento; most male critics bemoaned the lack of villainy in Witt's performance, but women better recognize the type: sweet, manipulative, a little too willing to be seduced, the minx disguised as a mouse. <br />Bullock and Grant have decent chemistry, though it does not match up with the chemistry Bullock had with Ben Affleck in \\"Forces of Nature\\" or the cop/criminal attraction she had with Gosling in \\"Murder By Numbers.\\" When Grant's funny, \\"Two Weeks Notice\\" is funny; when he's thrown into earnestness by the movie's second half, \\"Two Weeks Notice\\" is left with Bullock v. Witt, and as foxy as Witt might be in a strapless bra, Bullock wears her chaps of charm and bulldozes the event.  <br />It's hot and cold, here and there, daft and sad, a little neurotic: \\"Two Weeks Notice\\" is a stock Bullock comedy.
B00008LDPU|3.0|Rent this DVD.  Don't buy it.  Each one is unique and fairly interesting but the whole thing isn't worth owning.  If you are fan and will get the trilogy boxed set when it comes out then if this isn't included then I would get it.  Otherwise just wait for it.  Second Renasiacnace Part 1 &amp; 2 is great since it is a prequel to the films.  Kid's story explains who that annoying kid that pops up in Matrix Reloaded.<br />Anyway they are interesting but unless you've got money to blow just wait till a boxed set comes out.
0743233832|5.0|\\"What is its individual make-up? Its essence, form, and matter?..<BR>(Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, VIII, 11)<BR>I recall when I had in-class Greek examinations, and we were asked to translate quotes of Marcus Aurelius chosen at random. Chance did let me encounter this verse a few times, and each time I did put more effort finalized in the understanding and expression of meanings implied in these straightforward questions.<BR>     The greatness of this work could best be found in its brevity and simplicity. The plain style, and the naturalness of writing are persuasive. The moral truths that Marcus Aurelius had accepted in the past, and that much had enlightened his being both an emperor and a conflictual human-being, have been transposed in memorable form. Marcus Aurelius'soliloquy and self-analysis are a great spiritual exercise. As such, the book is an exhortation to think and meditate, and it is especially addressed to those who hold the power, and are in charge of other people who stand for them. The dynamics of leadership haven't changed in the millenia: [Yet] I ask myself if today's leaders are driven and inspired by such honesty of intents?!<br />     Marcus Aurelius had been influenced by the work of Epictetus. Both belong to the late Stoicism: A period that didn't produce anything of original. In this viewpoint, it could be argued that \\"the Meditations\\" were a moral set of catchphrases of the earlier Stoa. As such, this work doesn't bring any novelty neither in physics, nor in logics, and ethics, or epistemology. It could also be argued that Marcus Aurelius was not a philosopher at all, but rather a  self-disciplined and very well-educated man and leader. He didn't produce these chapters neither for a vast audience  nor for publication. Things are best remembered when written down. As such, the emperor wrote expressions of his thought, and read them again and again to himself. I believe that this discipline much helped him to find the strength and willpower necessary to face enemies outside (and inside) Rome, and the destiny of the antiquity's greatest empire. <br />     The \\"Meditations\\" are therefore a powerful and elightening work of self-analysis and virtues' devotion. Although it does not add anything new to the phylosophical Zeitgeist, it can be argued that -- on the contrary, both brevity and simplicity,  are here best expressed with a plain, natural, and unpretentious style. Such lack of redundant embellishments make this work a duly inspiring masterwork.<br />     This version is a very solid and contemporary transposition of Marcus Aurelius'notes. Both mastery and choice of terms are remarkable. Not only the Hicks have captured the essence and clarity of the emperor's thought and affection, but also have given him fresh and renewed life and recognition.
B00008NRLX|5.0|I had heard of the Jayhawks during my years of working at a book/music store but never really heard any of their stuff. Then a couple weeks ago they were interviewed on NPR's Weekend Edition and played some songs off &quot;Rainy Day Music&quot; and suddenly I became obsessed with hearing the full album.<br />Every song on this CD is absolutely amazing. Their simple yet elegant harmonies, combined with the lyrics, makes for an album that trancends musical genres while paying homage to the great songwriters/musicians of the late sixties and early seventies.
0385504209|4.0|The #1 job of a novelist is to keep the reader turning pages, and Dan Brown succeeds with The Da Vinci Code. Brown builds a story that races from one plot twist to another with breathless action: the over-used moniker &quot;page-turner&quot; applies in this case. The plot is tight and lean, showcasing Brown's greatest strength: his ability to feed the reader new nuggets of information every few pages, while stringing along a number of other mysterious threads. This gives the reader a sense of constant discovery, while building anticipation for answers to come.<br />I have a few quibbles with the book, and they really are quibbles more than anything. First, Brown seems to have a penchant for beginning his sentences (especially in action sequences) with participial phrases: &quot;Turning now and scanning the room, Sophie's eyes...&quot;, &quot;Walking toward the bare wooden wall, Sophie...&quot;, &quot;Feeling around the edge of the panels, Sophie...&quot; &quot;Heart pounding, she placed her finger...&quot; And so on. Like salt, a little bit of this technique adds flavor; also like salt, too much ensures you can't taste anything else. A hundred pages in, I found myself starting to count the occurrences. I think his editor could have been a bit more ruthless in this department.<br />Second, Brown manages to interrupt his own sparkling narrative flow on a number of occasions. Many times, his characters reflect back on some past event: the dreaded flashback. Again, no big whoop when used here and there, but Brown does border on overuse.<br />At other times, Brown interrupts the narrative for lengthy author intrusions. That's probably my biggest complaint, come to think of it: Brown pushes too far to explore his basic premise. Before the book has ended, he has told you everything from iambic pentameter to Disney movies to Swiss banking is an admirably subversive attempt to keep paganism alive in today's society. (Read the book and you'll understand.) Well, Gee, Dan. Sometimes an architect uses circles in her designs for aesthetic reasons, and not because she's trying to make people worship the pagan sun symbol.<br />In instances like these (as well as instances where hotly-debated issues of New Testament scholarship are cited as fact: Mary Magdalene's role in the early church, the existence of the &quot;Q&quot; document, and so on), the reader might rightly feel the characters are speaking more for Dan Brown than for themselves--and sounding a wee bit shrill in the process.<br />But hey, it's Dan Brown's book, and he controls its universe. It's his prerogative to explore whatever issues he wants, however he wants. Whatever misgivings you may have about the content (and most Evangelical Christians and Catholics with have major misgivings), you can't fault the guy on his craft: he knows how to put together a damned good read.ometimes an architect uses circles in her designs for aesthetic reasons, and not because she's trying to make people worship the pagan sun symbol. <br />In instances like these (as well as instances where hotly-debated issues of New Testament scholarship are cited as fact: Mary Magdalene's role in the early church, the existence of the &quot;Q&quot; document, and so on), the reader might rightly feel the characters are speaking more for Dan Brown than for themselves--and sounding a wee bit shrill in the process. <br />But hey, it's Dan Brown's book, and he controls its universe.

B00007G1ZM|5.0|Joan Crawford had been making successful movies since the silent era.  Her early career was full of singing and dancing, rarely showing the edginess that came to mark her later films.  Before she was forced to leave MGM, most often she played roles that demonstrated a lighter touch.  After signing with Warners, the Joan Crawford that most Americans came to know her by became evident.  With MILDRED PIERCE, she shows the quintessential gravitas that later generations came to revere.  <br />By 1945, Crawford's career was seen, mistakenly as it turned out, to be in eclipse.  Director Michael Curtiz saw in her the actress who could radiate the same ruthless business sense that marked her business life but was paradoxically absent from that of her personal life.  Just as Jay Gatsby came to symbolize the hollowness of the Jazz Age, so did Mildred do for the new spirit of American woman who had to struggle alone to build a life while their husbands were busy fighting overseas.  Oddly enough, the role of Mildred was first offered to Bette Davis, who unwisely turned it down.  Director Curtiz's instincts about Crawford were squarely on the mark as she went on to win an Oscar for Best Actress, beating out Ingrid Bergman, Greer Garson, and Gene Tierney.  The toughness of the Mildred Pierce from the novel by James Cain is evident in nearly every scene except when Crawford chooses to drop the mask of continuous self-sacrifice to reveal a woman who has been buffeted by one husband who fails to see her essential goodness, a second husband who sees her only as a meal ticket, and a daughter whose nastiness was rivalled only by Bette Davis as slutty Mildren Rogers from OF HUMAN BONDAGE.  <br />Crawford is Mildred Pierce,a tough-minded woman, abandoned by her husband (Bruce Bennet) to care for her two young daughters.  The younger of the two dies of pneumonia, forcing Mildred to find work as a waitress.  At this job, she starts at the very bottom of the restaurant totem pole.  The hoursare long, her feet are killing her, and the tips are lousy.  But little by little, her life starts to fall into all the right places.  Eve Arden is Ida, the wisecracking manager of the restaurant who first hires her then goes on to steal the show with the acid witticisms that have come to mark her career.  What happens to Mildred is the downside of the American Dream that dictates that hard work, gumption, and feistiness lead to financial success.  Mildred quickly learns the ropes of How to Make a Buck.  She finds her success but at the cost of gaining an unscrupulous husband (Zachary Scott) while losing her remaining daughter Veda (Ann Blythe), whose ingratitude and moral sleaziness are immortalized in her parting lines to Mildred: 'I hate the smell of grease in your kitchen and on you.'  With the non-stop complaints of the harridan-like Veda, she succeeds in coming across as the fun-loving flapper of a previous generation who finds out to her dismay that when the partying is over, she is expected to clean up her own mess.  Veda and Mildred's new husband are the perfect pair: flashy on the outside, empty on the inside, and determined to climb the ladder of success on the other's respective back.<br />The joy of watching MILDRED PIERCE is not just from seeing how well Crawford claws her way to success while trying all the while to have the personal life that her business life seems bent on withholding.  It also resides in the way the supporting cast bounces off each other at just the right pitch and the right moment.  One of the film's central ironies is that the man who abandons her at the film's start (Bennet) stands revealed as the only one of Mildred's inner circle who remains loyal by the closing credits.  Mildred, like Gatsby, learns a brutal truth about that tough climb up the ladder: wealth earned at the cost of losing one's family is a bleakly inadequate substitute for that loss.  Gatsby never had a chance to learn this.  Mildred did.

B00003CXSP|1.0|I was expecting more from this movie than what i saw.  To start with, the original Clarice (Jodi Foster) was not in the movie. Secondly, there wasn't enough suspense in it, it lacked quality. I read the book before i saw the movie and the two are totally different from each other. I suggest that if you want to see Hannibal at its finest, then read the book!
B000002WYT|5.0|Some people give Crash a hard time, but it gives amazing classics like Two Step, Tripping Billies, Lie in Our Graves, Too Much, and of course, #41. Now, even though it's true that these songs are better live, this is still an amazing album. Really the only track I dislike is Let You Down, but with that exception, it's a very good album to listen to from start to finish. Someone in one of the other reviews basically said that Drive In Drive Out is a bad song that you can only give \\"a few listens\\" to. Well, let me just say that Drive In Drive Out is one of DMB's best studio songs ever, and is a staple of this CD. As far as how it compares to other DMB CDs, Under the Table and Dreaming is a classic with a fresh and energetic feel, Before These Crowded Streets is a dark masterpiece with such depth that it can seem more like a novel or a movie rather than a CD, and this album, Crash, is literally and figurativly somewhere in the middle but is an excellent album nonetheless. <br />Lastly, if you like or love Dave and play accostic guitar, then you need to buy Live at Luther College. Okay, that's it, hope my ramblings help someone a bit.

B00003CXZ4|3.0|_Memento_ is a revenge/thriller that stars Guy Pearce, who turns in a very good performance, in the role of Leonard Shelby, a widower, who has completely lost the ability to make short-term memories since the rape and murder of his wife.  Since Shelby cannot remember anything from one minute to the next, he is forced to develop a system of documenting the clues he discovers during his investigation, including information about whom to trust, or not.  He relies primarily on Polaroids, notes and tattoos in order to help him remember the most important \\"facts\\" he discovers. Along the way, Shelby is befriended by Natalie, played by Carrie Anne Moss, and Lenny, who is brilliantly portrayed by Joe Pantoliano.<br />Delivered by director Christopher Nolan as a series of short pieces, which are then strung together in reverse chronological order, _Memento_ is effective in creating for the viewer a sense of Shelby's dilemma in terms of solving the remaining mystery surrounding his wife's murder.  _Memento_ offers a reasonably original screenplay that is well acted on the overall, and, considering that this is Nolan's second film, the directorial work is deserving of praise.  That said, for me _Memento_ started to wear thin about 3/4's of the way through its 113-minute running time.  (FWIW 120+ minute run times tend to be my preference).  Personally, I found the subtexts of the plot rather obvious - not disinteresting, just obvious.  Additionally, I think that _Memento_ would have benefited greatly from a somewhat faster pace.<br />I rented the standard widescreen edition of the DVD, so I cannot comment on any extras in the deluxe package(s) that may be available.  The picture quality and digital transfer are excellent, as is the sound quality of the DD 5.1 soundtrack.  Note, however, that the audio mix is very straightforward (as befits the movie) and does not make extensive use of the capabilities of modern multi-channel systems.<br />With all the hype that surrounded this movie, I almost bought it sight unseen a few times.  It's definitely worth a single viewing, though I doubt I'll ever watch it a second time.  Don't get me wrong, this is a good movie - I personally just don't think it's great!  I'm glad I rented it!!!
0812589041|3.0|Ender's Game was a fun read even with it's flaky story lines (training adolescents to save the world, kids vying for power by using the nets,   etc.)  The thing I don't understand is why so many people think it's the best sci-fi book ever written.  Anybody every read Asimov?  If you like sci-fi then you will enjoy this book, but I think you would be disappointed with Ender's Game if you don't like sci-fi.
B00005JKPF|4.0|Mutants both evil and good find themselves on the run when the evil General Stryker (Bryan Cox) devises a plan to rid Earth of their kind.  The plot, such as it is, exists mostly as a framing device for a succession of spectacular scenes in which the mutants from the first film, along with some new ones, engage in a series of battles, pursuits, and narrow escapes. Director Bryan Singer and the screenwriters pack in as many mutants as possible and pepper the film with brief, efficient, effective character moments.  The result is less a cohesive story than a game of \\"Spot That Mutant,\\" but it is very entertaining nevertheless.  It was fun to see Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) as such a prominent character; he was my favorite X-Man when I was a kid.  Colossus makes a brief but tantalizing appearance as well; hopefully, we'll see more of him in the next film.  If you're looking for a noisy, action-packed good time, this is the film for you.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I have to admit that I am not a fan of musicals, but Chicago is an exception.  I am used to watching comedies and science fiction fantasies. And, as a heterosexual male, I always shun Broadway show tunes or any movies about Broadway. I was very judgmental about Chicago, thinking that the movie was a run-of-the mill musical featuring corny songs and stupid dialogues. Chicago changed my mindset about musicals because the movie runs on different levels for viewers. Senior citizens will love Chicago because the movie is set in the 20s. Women will like the catchy tunes and the choreography. Men, like myself, will adore the beautiful women prancing around as prostitutes, the Jazz slang, and the abrupt violence. Chicago is a movie that captivates all types of people.
B000092ZYX|4.0|How is it possible that I think this record is really good, while some think it is earth-shattering, and plenty believe it to be complete junk?  It's valuable to uncover the element of honesty in their perspectives, as well as the grain of truth, if any, in mine.<br />Why are the critical reviewers somewhat right in their assessment?  When compared to the band's later work (OK Computer, Kid A, Amnesiac), many of these tracks seem somewhat reminiscient of earlier material.  Plenty of the songs are similar to Kid A/Amnesiac, such as Scatterbrain (which evokes the horror of \\"Knives Out\\") and \\"Sit Down, Stand Up,\\" where Thom's wailing at times recalls \\"Everything In Its Right Place.\\"   As a result of this similarity, some tunes like \\"I Will\\" and \\"Where I End and You Begin\\" don't seem necessarily brilliant with respect to earlier material.  And as for the die-hard Bends fans: no, this is not a return to form (you may want to take a peek at \\"Go to Sleep,\\" although I can't guarantee anything :).<br />So terrible record, right?  Not exactly.  The critics of \\"Hail\\" are too often missing the boat entirely-- Sail to the Moon seems superior to its predecessors rather than a cheap replica, and this happens several other times on the record.  What sets this new album apart from the previous ones is that it somehow manages to borrow heavily and still sound fresh and interesting.  The subject matter expands further (Wolf at the Door, Punch Up At a Wedding), and damn it if there isn't a degree of sense of humor on this record at times (2+2=5, We Suck Young Blood).<br />The album is not a 10/10 like many will have you believe.  I am somewhat glad, frankly; can't Radiohead make a good, fun record that doesn't challenge the definition of \\"music?\\"  They've already done that before.  On \\"Hail to the Thief,\\" they stretch their styles and ideas into new areas, and perfect some old concepts.  And they still manage to sound brilliant often enough to make this album worth hearing.
B00005AQF7|5.0|You all know I could go on to boast about how much of a classic rap album this is, but it would just be redundant, I've had this cd since day one and I have finally got around to writing a review for it. This CD sums up what a great rap CD is. Any person who wants to experience the best in the rap genre should pick up Big Snoop Dogg's first album which pushed him into fame...is it worth buying so late after released? fo shizzel my nizzel.
B00003CXPJ|2.0|First, I would like to say that I have loved Ben Stiller's work in the past, he has talent to burn.  This movie, however, did not help his already marginal career along.  It did however give Will Ferrel an opportunity to completely run away with the film.  As many of the reviewers say, this could have been so much more.  In general, you've got two types of humor:  the long term and the short term.  Long-term humor keeps things general and works with archetypes and stereotypes.  It avoids naming names if possible.  These kinds of stories really need an investment of good writing.  Short term humor is aimed at a specific target and is generally used as a means of levelling and bringing your betters down to your level; thus the expression, 'taking someone down a peg or two'.  That said, this movie represented a golden opportunity to make some serious comedic observations about celebrity and fashion life in general.  Stiller unfortunately chose the easy way out and decided to shoot his wad on cheap one-liner jokes about flavor-of-the-month celebrities who will be forgotten in a short time.  Another problem is the inheritant one dimensionality of models and celebrities that Stiller chooses to exploit in the first place and that he ultimately ends up boxing his own character up in.  Other than his tinselly motive of starting a reading center for kids, why should we care about narcistic Derek Zoolander?  He gives us nothing to laud, and therefore nothing about the film to move us along.  It also completely tanks in the middle with too much expositionary dialogue that goes nowhere, Jerry Stiller's stupid prostate jokes, and a gratutous gang-bang scene that came from out of nowhere.  Is Zoolander a complete washout?  No!   There are some truly inspired scenes in this film:  the gasoline/Wham scene, Zoolander's brainwashing, and Will Ferrel!  If you see this movie for any reason, see it for Ferrel as he is truly out of control in this picture with his evil fashion designer character that parodies (in part) certain evil African dictators.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is the greatest album ever made.
B00008S2VG|2.0|I've listened to it over and over again but I just can't get to like it.  I think it's Mirwais.  He is an excelent producer, no mistake about that.  But he really doesn't fit well with Madonna.  After having great results with such producers as Stephen Bray, Patrick Leonard, Shep Pettibone, and even William Orbit she picked this guy who, honestly, doesn't do her any justice.  I honestly believe that it's the absence of Patrick and William that have made this album so horrible to listen to.<br />Add to that the fact that the lyrics are uninspiring, incoherent, and immature.  Anyone that tells you otherwise in these reviews is Madonna newbie.  When you look at some of her greatest lyrical moments like &quot;Live to Tell&quot;, &quot;Oh Father&quot;, or &quot;You'll See&quot; as well as some of her great dance hits like &quot;Holiday&quot;, &quot;Into The Groove&quot;, &quot;Express Yourself&quot;, or &quot;Deeper and Deeper&quot; it's clear as crystal that this album lacks the depth of the former and the fun of the latter.<br />Her &quot;raps&quot; are downright embarrassing, the vocoder makes her sound like every other vocoder using artist out there (Cher anyone), and the lyrics (if you can put them back together from their diced form) are extremely hard to relate to.  Lyrics like &quot;I guess I did it wrong, that's why I wrote this song&quot; and &quot;I'm so stupid, cause I used to live in a fuzzy dream&quot; are laced throughout this album.  What a joke.<br />She needs to go back and ask Patrick Leonard for some help.  He did the most amazing work with her on so many albums (True Blue, Like a Prayer, Ray of Light, et al.) and created the most memorable and musical tracks on &quot;Ray of Light&quot; (Frozen, Skin, Nothing Really Matters).  Why she dumped him for Mirwais, I'll never understand.
6304696566|3.0|I have nothing but the greatest admiration for John Ford and John Wayne. Several of their screen collaborations--Stagecoach, The Quiet Man, The Cavalry Trilogy, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance and even the late, genial comedy Donovan's Reef--have a justifiable place on the list of the world's greatest films. It is now common wisdom that The Searchers was the greatest of their collaborations, certainly the greatest Western ever made, and quite possibly the greatest film in any genre. I must regretfully dissent, even though I see what people admire about the film. Wayne's performance as Ethan Edwards may well be Exhibit A for the advocates of Wayne as a great actor, not just a screen icon (Stagecoach, Red River, The Quiet Man and The Shootist are also sterling examples of Wayne's artistry). The magnificent photography of Monument Valley, effectively dwarfing the human characters, is breathtaking, and the film's scenes of stark tragedy are unforgettable (I particularly remember Harry Carey Jr,'s suicidal ride into the Indian encampment). It is the film's comic relief that leaves me with a bitter taste in my mouth. There are exactly two intelligent characters in the entire movie: Ethan Edwards and Chief Scar. They are also by far the two meanest characters in the movie. They are surrounded by a bunch of well-meaning dolts who would stick out like a sore thumb in a Three Stooges short. The young lovers played by Jeffrey Hunter and Vera Miles are so abysmally stupid that we quickly cease to care about them. But Hunter and Miles are Einsteins compared with the third member of their love triangle, played so broadly by Ken Curtis that you want to belt him in the mouth every time he appears on screen. (That Miles can see anything in Curtis makes her character all the more unsympathetic.) These characters, representing what passes on the frontier for civilization, are completely unfunny and unlikable. While I realize that is Ford's point, it makes The Searchers very nearly unwatchable for me. The equation of nice=stupid and smart=mean in The Searchers goes beyond the annoying into the realms of the nihilistic. I might be a little cynical myself, but I flatly refuse to accept Ford's bitter vision in The Searchers.watchable for me. The equation of nice=stupid and smart=mean in The Searchers goes beyond the annoying into the realms of the nihilistic.

0930289234|5.0|I've known about Watchmen since I was a kid when it first came out and all the comic store clerks wherever I went would rave about it. I only got around to reading it recently probably at a time when I could really appreciate it. The key to the success and popularity of this book is definitely Alan Moore's storytelling skill. This book takes quite a few chapters to get into but everything from the very beginning comes together in an almost artistic way for a spectacular if not disturbing ending. Moore describes in detail the characterizations of what would cause someone to become this unlikely thing known as a costumed hero as well as everyone else's likely reaction to it. This book easily emphasizes the critical effect story can have over comics with just fancy artwork and grandiose superhero poses. I am not easily impressed or swayed by others opinions but this story is well worth the ample praise people have lavished on it over the years.
B000092T6M|5.0|this is the coolist movie, i've liked it since i was 4 when i had it on laser disc(the old dvd) and now it is remastered added to and put on dvd.this has comedy,romance,action and lots of sword fights(some without swords) the bottom line GET IT.
B00005JKZV|5.0|The Two Towers was the greatest movie of 2002.The movie diverges from the book on some (in my opinion) minor plot points. But it follows the journey of the sundered Fellowship very well. From the dramatic opening to the close of the movie, The Two Towers delivers action, romance, drama, and a wee bit of comedy (courtesy of the wonderful Gimli the Dwarf). Everything about this movie is wonderful, from the battle of Helm's Deep to the Ents (which took my breath away). The development of the character Gollum was amazing. The only plot change I don't like is Faramir wanting the ring. I like the book versio of Faramir's encounter with the ring much better. Anyway, the acting is amazing, special effects spectacular, and the plot is wonderful. This movie is wonderful and it deserves 5 stars.
B000002I2I|5.0|Morrison Hotel is the Doors' best album. While there were more hits on every other album they recorded with Jim Morrison, none of the albums rocked harder or were more consistent than this one. Morrison's rougher and grittier vocals made the tracks even better. Simply put, there isn't a bad track here. The excellent tracks \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" and \\"Peace Frog\\" still receive extensive airplay on classic rock radio. Lesser-known tracks like \\"Waiting For The Sun\\", \\"Ship of Fools\\", and \\"The Spy\\" are also very strong tracks. But the best tracks may be their softer tracks such as \\"Blue Sunday\\", \\"Indian Summer\\", and the jazzy \\"Queen of The Highway\\", which is highlighted by Ray Manzarek's great organ playing. There are also some good upbeat tracks, for the Doors at least, in \\"Land Ho!\\" and \\"You Make Me Real.\\" The performances by John Densmore and Robby Krieger are strong throughout, their playing perfectly fitting the mood of each song, such as Densmore's drumming on \\"Ship of Fools\\" and Krieger's guitar playing on the softer tracks. An excellent album and one of the best of the late 1960's.
B00008973Q|2.0|As a South-African, I have been more or less unaffected by the Kurosawa hype that seems ubiquitous in the United States of America. I happened upon copies of two of his more revered works, &quot;Ran&quot; and &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;, and have to say that was resolutely dissappointed. <br />Ran is ponderous and pulpily paced when there is no battle taking place. The film seems to have been designed solely around the epic battle scenes, which are magnifiscent. The &quot;King Lear&quot; intertext is well imagined, but tenuously arranged, merely fascilitating the films expansive raison d' etre. Contrary to what many people believe, Kurosawa directed and designed his films with a shrewd eye for the American public and its perceptions, while adding elements of Noh Japanese theatre to taint the efficacy of such accusations. His choice to adapt &quot;King Lear&quot;, as well as &quot;Macbeth&quot; for &quot;Throne of Blood&quot;, was unfortunate and caused widespread dissatisfaction within his native country especially towards the end of his life, although the films were devoured by American audiences. His work is just as much a gateway into Japanese culture as the &quot;Mr. Bean&quot; series is into U.K. culture. &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; is a copy of the Western prototype, bloated by an hour and a half. &quot;Rashomon&quot;'s central conceit is not nearly as revolutionary as it at first seems. <br />For authenticity, try the films of Yasujiro Ozu (grim social realism) or Masaki Kobayashi (gripping surrealism, esp. on &quot;Kwaidan&quot;).
0767830555|5.0|I'm not really much of a movie &quot;critic&quot;; In fact I dislike most critics as they think everyone else should have the same tastes in movies and plays.  In my personal opinion, Taxi Driver MUST be one of the best, if not the best, movies of all time.  If you are looking for an Action Jackson, kill'em all, special effects, light-speed space travel thriller then... You will be disappointed.  However, if you enjoy thought-provoking stories, solid, convincing acting, and a movie that seriously makes you THINK and entertain you at the same time, Taxi Driver is the spot!  Then again, thats just my personal opinion :)

B00005221M|2.0|The Last of the Mohicans has always been a favorite of mine.  When it was time to update from video to DVD, I purchased it, threw it in the DVD player and was shocked to find one of my favorite films altered.  Don't let the catch-phrase on the DVD cover fool you!  It's not expanded.  Yes, some scenes are edited differently and there's some extra dialouge just before the end credits, but Mann has removed some really great dialouge that, for me, makes this movie one of my favorites.  This film hasn't been expanded, it's been altered.  Why did Mann do this?  The film was fine the way it was.  If Mann was going to add footage to it, he should not had sacrificed original footage.  A huge disapointment.  I'll keep my VHS version and sell the DVD on e-bay.
038572179X|4.0|On a scale from 1 to 7 (7=outstanding, 4=average, 1=horrendous) ...<br />Plot: 4<BR>Structure: 7 (Can't rave about it enough)<BR>Language: 6 (Very accessible, beautiful without calling attention to itself)<BR>Character Development: 6 (Briony will definitely stay with you)<BR>Action: 3<BR>Descriptions and settings: 4<br />While on the surface not much happens in this story, the implications are huge, and McEwan's ability to make you identify with the different characters is superb, even though the characters are not always likeable and their actions are complex. The way the story is structured is so magnificent that it makes up for the plot's lack of interest overall. The middle section dealing with the retreat from Dunkirk while treating the subject realistically, lacks drama for a war scene. But all of these are minor quibbles. The story will have you thinking about it's implications for days and weeks after you've finished reading it. Some of the other books I've read this year including Franzen's \\"The Corrections,\\" Faber's \\"The Crimson Petal and the White,\\" Marquez's \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude,\\" McEwan's own \\"Amsterdam,\\" and even the first three Harry Potters are fading from my memory, while \\"Atonement\\" continues to linger on along with another disturbing (though far less accessible) masterpiece I recently read for the first time, \\"The Sound and the Fury.\\" I think McEwan's book will last in the public's memory as well as Faulkner's.

B0000009RX|4.0|I bought this CD because for some reason one day the lyrics to \\"hey punk, where you going....\\" started going through my mind insistently. And I started remembering how profound some of the lyrics were, or at least seemned to a stoned-out mind (\\"you paint your head, your mind is dead, you don't even know<BR>what I just said\\"), and I decided it would be a good nostalgia trip for a mind which has not been stoned-out for a very long <BR>time (I know, \\"nostalgia\\" is a funny term to apply to Frank Zappa music, but...). So, I went to Amazon, and two weeks later I'm immersed in Zappa wierdness once again.<BR>    Its served its nostalgic purpose, with one small complaint -- there are some sounds (voices, instruments) I remember being on the LP album which I can't here on this CD. Especially, on \\"Concentration Moon\\", the high-pitched vocal accompaniments to the lead singer are just not there. Anyway, thats why I gave it just four stars. Other than that -- well, its interesting to revisit this bent-out-of-shape mind-set from the vantage point of a world that has moved so far beyond those times.
B00005JLPK|5.0|If I had art supplies with me, I'd start to paint my thoughts -- and I'm not even a painter.  I want to create art that does indeed change the mirror we hold up to reality and art that gives us a chance to think.  Really think.  As a theatre actor/director who is constantly inspired by Julie Taymor, I'm overjoyed to say this film won't disappoint anyone.  The music, the voices, the tones, the colors and the details (for a lady libra such as yours truly, it all matters)...  the acting and passion of Salma and Alfred -- along w/the team of other players...  I have always wanted to meet Frida and thru this film, we can all meet a part of her.  Kudos to Salma for believing and being patient with this project.  The time, energy and love is what shines thru.  And you DO NOT have to be a Frida lover to appreciate this film.
0783227019|1.0|My only reason for seeing this film is because Luis Guzman is in it.  I prefer the murder mysteries of Brian De Palma, but this movie is just a somewhat organized crime drama.  Not a good film.  Enjoyed seeing Penelope Ann Miller act again.  DVD includes production notes, cast and filmmakers and theatrical trailer.  Shown in squeezy widescreen.    Followed by the straight-to-DVD film, CARLITO'S WAY: RISE TO POWER (2005), a prequel.
B000059XUO|5.0|After I heard from friends about this movie I decided to go out and rent it, I was expecting some good action scenes but thats it, or so I thought. When I watched it what I did get was a sad gothic love story mixed in with action, drama, romance and all other things. What really got to me was the setting, a lawless city right on the edge of an Apacolypse, also the plot may of not sounded that new or original, but Brandon Lee's performance and character, a man so overcome with love that it was felt that his soul should of been returned, really made up for it. I cannot really explain how this movie was able to obtain such a cult status, but I assure you that this is one movie that you must see in your life atleast once.
B000002UB3|5.0|Although I'm more of a classical and jazz fan, I still like lots of popular music and especially rock. This album would have to be in my top ten list of rock albums. This was the album that, when John Lennon was asked when it would come out, he said, \\"They're not ready for it yet,\\" and it shows. From the light-hearted and humorous Maxwell's Silver Hammer and Octopus's Garden to the more serious \\"She's So Heavy,\\" to Here Comes the Sun, an elaborately orchestrated song-cycle almost unto itself, the songs on this album show what a tremendous range of styles the Beatles were capable of, from funky tin-pan-alley and bluesy to almost classical.<br /><br />The Beattles were one of the most prolific bands of all time, producing over 200 songs in the few years they were together, much of it ground-breaking stuff. And I can't forget to mention George Martin's superb arrangements, who was responsible for the way many of the Beatles' songs sounded. George was a big part of the Beatle's success and he was reunited with them for the last time to do this album, and it that shows, too. If I remember right, George was also knighted recently by the Queen?<br /><br />Overall, perhaps the greatest album by the greatest rock group of all.
B000002HMH|5.0|I've read the reviews of this album, along with those for ReLoad, and I have one thing to say. If these albums were Metallica's debuts, or albums from any other band, eveybody would love them. Thse albums are truly amazing. Songs like King Nothing, Outlaw Torn, Until It Sleeps, and certainly Hero of the Day are awesome songs. This album is a standout work, and should be respected by everyone. Metallica are not sell-outs just because they made music that was a little slower and unlike what they had done before.
0312958455|5.0|I was just a page or two into The Last Coyote when I knew that I would be reading a lot of Michael Connelly this summer. After reading all of the Travis McGee and Matt Scudder books, I was looking for a new character that I could relate to. Harry Bosch is that guy, and I will be going back to the first three in the series asap. The plotting is nicely crafted, the pacing perfect, the dialogue real, and the LA setting is almost surreal. I was reminded of Ellroy's LA Confidential, one of my favorites. For those of you who especially enjoy getting to know a character in a continuing series, there is a lot to know about this hard boiled LAPD detective. If you don't know Harry Bosch, this book is a great place to start.
0380973650|5.0|My first exposure to Neil Gaiman was his critically acclaimed Sandman comics, and I never expected him ever to match that achievement.  With American Gods, I think Gaiman has proven me wrong.  We see a colorful and engaging story unfold through the eyes of Shadow, a man who emerges from prison expecting to return to his loving wife and some semblance of normalcy.  Instead, he finds himself embroiled in a struggle among gods.  Along the way he meets ancient gods surviving on meager whispers of belief and getting by as laborers, grifters, or prostitutes.  He also encounters the new gods, representing the internet and mass media, who expect to supplant the old gods entirely.<br />Yet what makes American Gods so successful is its blend of the supernatural with &quot;mundane&quot; Americana.  Most of the story takes place on the road in the heartland of the United States, in small towns, in motels, or at tourist attractions.  The most touchingly drawn characters are the mere mortals who play a role in the tale.  In fact, the only character who seems underdeveloped for much of the novel is Shadow, the protagonist.  However, Gaiman explicitly addresses this issue, and it does not detract from the sense that Shadow is a real person, albeit a quiescent one.<br />With its imaginative premise, intelligent plot, believable characters, attention to both the epic and the intimate, and an adroit writing style that is neither too esoteric nor too blunt, American Gods is worthy addition to the pantheon of Hugo Award winners.  You should read it.
B00005CDNK|5.0|I remember buying this album on vinyl LP when it was first released in 1981 when I was 14.  I think I only played it a couple of times and gave it to a friend.  I had bought \\"Super Trouper\\" the year before and played it to death so I guess I was expecting Super Trouper Part 2 which this album definitely is not.  <br />22 years later I bought the CD version.  I certainly see the album in a different light to when it first came out.  I think being older and having a more evolved and advanced taste in music has given me a more vast appreciation of this album.<br />The tone of this LP seems to exude a forboding sense of imminent closure of ABBA. That doesn't mean it is not worth buying.  This is a long long way from \\"Ring Ring\\" and \\"Waterloo\\".   Even \\"Chiquitita\\" and \\"Does You Mother Know\\" seem like a decade before this album.  What an advancement musically.  What makes this album especially different to their others is the group's decision that the verses would be sung solo in all songs, rather than the trademark group lead vocals.<br />\\"The Visitors\\" is a disturbing opener with a menacing vocal performance by Frida.  Her voice is given a disembodied sound in the production, like she is struggling to get out of a phone booth!  It has been written that this song is about Soviet repression and paranoia.  She seems to have a slightly Russian/Soviet accent  (\\"I haff been waiting for these veeseeterrs....\\" ).  Given their support for the Let Poland be Poland campaign which resulted in their recordings being banned in the then USSR this seems like a veiled swipe at the repressive regime.<br />\\"Head Over Heels\\" is a poppy song with a lighter feel about an excessive woman who does not know when to stop.  Agnetha sounds like she is in a good mood in this song with her amused and cheery vocal performance. <br />\\"When All is Said and Done\\" is Frida's \\"The Winner Takes it All\\".  A very dramatic and cathartic song.  Frida is in very solid and strong form here.  It has been widely reported that she put a lot of present emotion and hurt into this song - given that her marriage to Benny Anderson had ended.<br />\\"Soldiers\\" always seems to have a mixed and divided reaction from ABBA fans but I like it.  Some people don't find the chorus very satisfying, maybe because there isn't much dynamic contrast to the verses.  It takes a few listens to get into this song.  The rhythm backing track is interesting - a syncopated drum beat with a deep fretless bass.  There is an electric guitar trill throughout that sets the tone nicely.<br />\\"I Let the Music Speak\\" is very theatrical. Is like 3 songs rolled into one. This has a very classical arrangement to it.  This song is really dark.  Frida is featured on this one with Agnetha lifting the dynamics in sections.<br />\\"One of Us\\" had a tremelo mandolin intro reminisent of the theme from Dr Zhivago.  It then forms a reggae feel.  Lyrically it seems like a sequel to \\"The Winner Takes it All\\".  It seems to be about a woman that has made the decision to end the union with her loved one. (\\"and so I dealt you the blow...\\") She is at peace with it but with a tinge of wondering whether it is what she really wanted.  This was their last worldwide hit single.<br />\\"Two for the Price of One\\" is very strange for ABBA.  Bjorn features on this one about a lonely man scouring the lonely heart columns in the newspaper and finding more than he bargained for.  Not many people rate this song as a favourite.  I must admit I don't care that much for this song but the chorus is catchy. A weird circus music like outro.<br />\\"Slipping Through My Fingers\\" is a very wistful song featuring Agnetha about her child (Linda Ulvaeous)being old enough to go to school and coming to terms with the fact that she is not going to be seeing as much of her as what she is used to seeing.<br />The closing track is \\"Like An Angel Passing Through My Room\\".  This track is such a soothing lullaby that you don't really notice until after you listen to itthat it only features Frida on vocals over a ticking clock and synth backing.<br />Then we have 4 bonus tracks. Basically the coda of ABBA itself.  The first is the B side of \\"One of Us\\" called \\"Should I laugh Or Cry\\".  Frida sounds great on this.  I like playing this in the quiet of the night.  Is certainly not hit single material but very satisfying.  <br />Then there is their final studio session \\"The Day Before You Came\\".  This one features Agnetha singing about how mundane her life was before a man walked into it.  Her performance is more subtle and emotional than what fans are used to but it suits the song.  Listen for Frida's operatic aria sections.  Shimmering!  I never knew she could sing so high.  <br />\\"Cassandra\\" is the B-side to TDBYC sung by Frida.  A haunting and epic song about a Joan of Arc type heroine who is banished and deported.  Wonderful dynamics and atmosphere.  Listen to this one in the headphones and you are swept in it.  <br />Last track is their final single release. \\"Under Attack\\" with Agnetha on lead.  This sounds very 80's.  The verses set up the strong chorus nicely. <br />I would much rather listen to this album than ABBA Gold<BR>Not to say that ABBA Gold is not good.  It is that this body of work is much more enriched and the songs have not been overexposed like \\"Mamma Mia\\" and \\"Dancing Queen\\" etc.  The group may have been declining commercially here but in a very graceful way.  There are many tracks here that are inspired by personal events going in the lives of the members of ABBA.  <br />My final word.  Buy it. You won't regret it!
0380789035|2.0|the idea of gods in modern times is not new, and even if it was, i'd expect the author to give us some substance whether it be in the skilled use of scientific or historical info, but there is nothing of interest here, no intracacies or complexities.  i expect the book won the hugo on the popularity of the author's graphic novels.
B00005JLRT|4.0|I liked it better than I thought I would, actually.  I heard more negative comments than positive ones before I saw it, so I wasn't expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised to find it enjoyable after all.  It's not Star Trek:TNG going out with a bang, but I still enjoyed the movie all the way through.  It felt more like just another episode of Star Trek rather than a movie finale.  It wasn't as powerful as Insurrection, which would have been a better choice for the final ST:TNG movie.
0790733226|5.0|Like all good science fiction, the futuristic setting is only glossy packaging to capture our interest while distancing us to the role of specator...the content is about our contemporary world and the issues within it.  Based on the late Dr Carl Sagan's book by the same name, &quot;Contact&quot; is an eloquent exposition about the conflict of opinion regarding science and religion.  No where is this more evident than in the range of reviews listed here and how the reviewers felt about the movie's message. <br />This is a \\"deep\\" movie - meaning it will appeal to those who like to think about their movies, rather than just experience them.  If you are hoping for a Heinlein \\"Starship Troops\\" action flick, forget it.  There is some amazing eye-candy in form of the much touted Earth fly-away in the opening and the psychedelic trip to Vega, (an obvious nod to another \\"deep\\" sci-fi film by another accomplished sci-fi author), but on the whole, this is film that will keep you occupied well past its 150-minute run time.<br />Is there reality a conflict between Science and Religion? Or is one a form of the other?  Can anyone really claim to be purely scientific or purely religious?  Or perhaps these are mutually supporting methodologies where the human race decides what it knows and what it doesn't know, but believes.  A review is not meant to answer these question, but viewing the film is certainly going to make you think about them.<br />Jodie Foster was perfectly cast in the role of Dr. Eleanor Arroway, an orphan turned scientist who is about as close to the purely-rational intellectual as a human can get.  (Remember, Mr. Spock was only half human.)  It was no doubt a risky move for a popular actress to play an atheist protagonist to an almost wholly religious audience, but Ms. Foster, noted for her integrity in choosing roles, delivers a performance that should have earned her an Oscar (or perhaps that was the price?)   <br />In all a great movie that I'm pleased to havein my collection and one I'd unconditionally recommend for those deep-thinkers and lovers of hard science fiction.

No where is this more evident than in the range of reviews listed here and how the reviewers felt about the movie's message. <br />This is a \\"deep\\" movie - meaning it will appeal to those who like to think about their movies, rather than just experience them.  If you are hoping for a Heinlein \\"Starship Troops\\" action flick, forget it.  There is some amazing eye-candy in form of the much touted Earth fly-away in the opening and the psychedelic trip to Vega, (an obvious nod to another \\"deep\\" sci-fi film by another accomplished sci-fi author), but on the whole, this is film that will keep you occupied well past its 150-minute run time.<br />Is there reality a conflict between Science and Religion? Or is one a form of the other?  Can anyone really claim to be purely scientific or purely religious?  Or perhaps these are mutually supporting methodologies where the human race decides what it knows and what it doesn't know, but believes.  A review is not meant to answer these question, but viewing the film is certainly going to make you think about them.<br />Jodie Foster was perfectly cast in the role of Dr. Eleanor Arroway, an orphan turned scientist who is about as close to the purely-rational intellectual as a human can get.  (Remember, Mr. Spock was only half human.)  It was no doubt a risky move for a popular actress to play an atheist protagonist to an almost wholly religious audience, but Ms. Foster, noted for her integrity in choosing roles, delivers a performance that should have earned her an Oscar (or perhaps that was the price?)   <br />In all a great movie that I'm pleased to havein my collection and one I'd unconditionally recommend for those deep-thinkers and lovers of hard science fiction.
6304708521|5.0|There has been so much negative stuff written about this obviously bad movie. The one thing people seem to miss is that this film broke so much new ground i.e. first video's for songs...the point is that it's not the quality of the movie..it's the content....and don't forget you get to see THE BEATLES!!!! You can't see them anymore, GET IT? Anyway, it's fun to spot mistakes in the film...like, the shadows of the film crew accidently being filmed...the shadows of boom mikes etc. This film is FUN...so have FUN watching it..otherwise you miss the point....LOVE>>>GEAR>>>FAB...dave
B000092Q4U|5.0|best album i've gotten in 2003 and it not only puts the nail in nu metal's coffin it pisses on it's ashes. anyone who is looking for something much more heavier and brutal than what the mainstream is offering needs to look no further. pop it in and forget all about the stuff you heard before from the nu metal trends. this is the next wave of metal my friends and trust me it's gonna be one hell of a ride.
B00008BXJF|5.0|Excellent, the King is back with this CD. Very original, very powerful, very great. Thinking rock that rocks. Buy it.
0156027321|5.0|this book is fabulous. evocative, lyrical, beautifully written.  it raises all the big questions about religion, but more importantly for me, about fiction and memory.<br />you can not truly have a critical reading of this book without a key piece of knowledge.  Richard Parker is not a name that Yann Martel chose carelessly.  He is, in fact, a real person.  He is the subject of a classic law case study from 19th century Britain involving 3 men who resort to cannibalism aboard a lifeboat.  Read the case and then re-think the book.  You might change your mind.
B00005JLR2|5.0|Treasure Planet is THE best Disney cartoon movie I have ever seen! I am like totally Treasure Planet crazy now! Just ask anyone I know. I think I have watched it about 50 times, infact I've watched it soooooooo much I drive everyone crazy. I rated this movie 5 stars, but that's soooooo not enough if I could I would give it like 100 stars! I think Morph and Jim are my favorite characters (not to mention that Jim Hawkins is totally hot!) If you haven't bought or seen this movie and didn't like it you must be totally off your rocker! You have to buy this movie! Trust me you'll love it!
B00005JKZV|5.0|Where LOTR: The Fellowship of the Rings was a set up for what the next two movies would be about, The Two Towers jumps in and moves at a much quicker pace than the first one.  As good as the first one was, the pace, action and suspense far outweigh the Fellowship in many ways.  With continuation of the battle for middle Earth, humans are forced to stand their ground at secluded keep in the mountians, knowing full well that a huge battle is to come.  Wholly outmatched and out numbered, they bravely take posts knowing that if Gandalf the White doesn't return with an army, all will be lost.  There is no doubt that the scale of this movie could not have been accurate had CGI not progrssed to what it is today.  The massive armies number in the hundreds of thousands, and you can see it.  For great grand epic adventures, this one tops them all.

0316666343|1.0|I hated this book! It started in an interesting way, and I thought it would be wonderful.  It soon rambled off into kindergarten pnilosophy.  The action is extremely slow and focus jumps around without apparent reason.  The ending was very disappointing.  There are no likable characters.  The narrator at first seems likable and certainly sympathetic, but the reader soon becomes impatient with the snail's pace of the action and the pointless digressions.  I stuck with it the book even though I was tempted to give up many times.  It was a waste of time and money.  I feel qualified to judge because I taught literature on the college level for many years.

0688163173|4.0|The last 50 pages or so of Shutter Island were very surpising and made the book, overall, worth reading for me and one which I would recommend to you. Up until this point, however, I kept wavering between feeling that I liked the book a lot and that it was just fair. This is because the book kept jumping between sub-plots and time periods. For me, at various times I found the story a little too convoluted. Perhaps it was because I, at times, didn't pay enough attention to some of the subtle clues that Lehane was providing. As such, my advice to you is that once you start this book be prepared to pay careful attention to all the little details or the ending may not be as clear as you'd like it to be. Shutter Island is not a book to read when you want to read only a few pages before falling asleep. To appreciate this rather complex book, it's one that requires your full attention. I've read all of Dennis Lehane's books and consider him to be one of my top 2-3 favorite authors. Shutter Island is worth reading and recommended, but it is not as rich in suspense and character development as Lehane's previous bestseller, Mystic River. That's a book that I would recommend to you without ANY reservations.
B000002UJQ|3.0|With every Radiohead release i've heard i only really like half the songs on the albums which cant really be helped, i like the diversity and experimentation of the band considering how popular they are they havent really been effected by the mainstream which is great but Thom Yorkes voice really is ear piercing at times when at other times he writes a great song you can really empathise with. They are still a breath of fresh air in the stale pop mainstream dominated by lack of talent though.
0446608955|5.0|I cannot give this book justice!  I cried for weeks after reading it, and also read it long before I saw the movie.  I have to thank this book for alot of things.

I almost had to set it down because I was crying so hard!
0321127420|3.0|I am a fan of Fowler's and especially his &quot;Refactoring&quot; book, which I also rate as a must read for the serious programmer.<br />Fowler's new book is an attempt to do for Enterprise Application Architecture what &quot;Design Patterns&quot; (i.e., GOF) did for OOP.<br />Unfortunately,while it is an excellent book, there are issues...<br />1)First, Design Patterns is a very dense and scholarly read. It is also, frankly, a difficult read. However, after you have spent a couple of days trying to digest a pattern from Design Patterns, you realize, in many cases, you have had an experience with something profound. Even the GOF authors, in the preface, attempt to console readers by admitting &quot;We didn't understand it all on the first writing!&quot;. Fowler's book, by contrast, is not on the same level, and can be understood on a first read. Perhaps this is what other reviewers were sensing when they indicated it was for the novice architect?<br />2) Fowler does NOT address security. How then,does the word &quot;Enterprise&quot; get the priviledge of adorning the title of his book? Enterprise design should be secure design. But, this will usually require a trade off --- more secure, less performance...or less secure, more scaleable...Fowler does not consider this. Example: A chapter is devoted to the &quot;Table Data GateWay&quot; pattern. The gateway pattern might be OK for J2EE...but it is not the most secure, or the best for performance,in .Net... The problem is it constructs its SQL statements in line, rather than using stored procedures. This allows SQL insertion attacks if your coders are sloppy, and also does not take advantage of the precompiled nature of sprocs.<br />3)There is a J2EE bias. This probably is a good thing as the J2EE architectures tend to be more mature and contain good ideas...but you should be aware of it if you are a .NET programmer. Not all of the patterns will be immediately useful to .NET, but will require a careful implementation.<br />4)Fowler passes on some of the tough questions. On page 93, while discussing RPC calls versus XML based messaging, he says &quot;my preference is for a message - based approach that's inherently asynchronous.&quot; I agree. (RPC style is not the really suited for async, whereas document style messaging is) He then says it is too large of a topic, so does not cover it. Well, if it is the best way, it needs to be covered in an Enterprise level book, no?<br />While I may seem to be critical of Fowler's book, I really think it is excellent with fine ideas. But, especially if you are from .Net, implement the patterns with care, and then only you have checked against Microsoft best practices. This is not to say Microsoft is always right, but get the second opinion anyway./>4)Fowler passes on some of the tough questions.

0553583182|5.0|A must read for everyone.  I even managed to get my brother to read it (I had to bribe him) and he actually LIKED it and said it is perception changing.<br />He didn't want to discuss further because he didn't want to downplay the effect this book has on him!!!  And he HATES NON-fictions!<br />I ain't even about to explain the clarity this book brings, and has brought to me.  Now I am able to voluntarily clear my head.  At any time.  Without the need for excersice or any of that \\"stress relieving\\" stuff we hear about, yet need to make time for.  Just by *thinking*, I do this.  That's all it takes, thinking.  And so can you.  Immediately I feel light and head is clear, as if I'm running on a threadmill.  This helps to make better decisions.  To sum up my review, BUY IT IF IT'S THE LAST BOOK U EVER READ.
B00005JLWN|4.0|At first glance, Equilibrium appears to be a cheap knock-off of Andy and Larry Wachowskis baby turned box-office smash, The Matrix.  However, Equilibrium is a cool flick in its own right (if a bit too violent for its own good), and very much worthy of sharing the stylized gunplay and black designer clothing with The Matrix.<BR> <BR> Written by director Kurt Wimmer, the script is solid for the most part, a rarity in the world of action filmmaking.  The acting is also convincing throughout, with both Christian Bales Preston and Angus MacFadyens DuPont standing out; Sean Beans brief appearance in the film is also quite good.  There are a few holes in the plot, such as why some of the other Clerics show both anger and pleasure (Taye Diggs character seems to grin like an idiot just a bit too often for a emotion suppressed Cleric).  But as a whole, the acting and writing are both a cut above what you might expect from this unheard of movie.<br /> In all seriousness, however, the focus of the film is undoubtedly its action.  And what stylish action it is.  The karate-gun fusion that is Gun Kata is simply a marvel to behold, and really gives the film its own kick.  The film feels bigger and grander than its $20 million dollar budget (For comparison, The Matrix budget totaled somewhere in the $90-$100 million dollar range), and, according to the directors commentary, several of the action scenes were shot in one take due to a lack of time, which is very impressive given their overall quality.<br /> Equilibrium is at heart an entertaining action flick, though its stab at bringing a little bit of intellect into the action genre is quite respectable.  It doesn't try to be anything more than it is, and that's okay because all it is is pure fun.

B00003CWN3|5.0|Hilary Swank won an award for her powerful portrayal of Teena Brandon, the sexual identity-confused woman on the run from the law. This film is very powerful, as it invokes various amounts of intense emotion and thought within the viewer, and the fact that this is based on a true story is what makes the film the more powerful.<br />A quick synopsis on the film:<br />Teena Brandon (who dresses like a boy, and goes by the alias of Brandon Teena) gets into a barfight over a girl named Candace (played by Alicia Goranson, as seen on television sitcom Roseanne), and in the midst of this, meets her friends John (played by Peter Sarsgaard) and Tom (played by Brendan Sexton III), two ex-cons. Teena becomes buddies with these two, and they invite her to a party in their hometown. The next day, they go to a different bar, and she then meets the moody and enigmatic Lana (played by Chloë Sevigny), along with her mother (played by Jeanetta Arnette) and one of Lana's friends, Kate (played by Allison Folland.)<br />Things seem quite bright and rosy, as Teena seems to be accepted as if she were one of the family. She seems to become one of the boys along with Tom and John, drinking and getting into trouble like any typical young misfit would. She develops an ever-blossoming love relationship with Lana, which helps to showcase some of the most beautiful, heartwarming and poignant attributes of the film. Everything seems quite lovely.<br />Later, things start to take a turn for the worse, as Teena's skeletons start to catch up with her, and the guise she depended on slowly starts to crumble. The beautiful lie gets shattered, and everything that was once peaceful becomes corrupted, and ultimately, she payed the price in one of the worst ways possible. As things start to crumble for Teena, the viewer's emotions start to spiral downhill from what was once an ethereal, transcendent disposition in quite an intense, earth-shattering way as well. You start to feel bad for Teena, and start to sympathize with her, even though she's made quite a few mistakes (e.g. breaking the law, lying about her real gender.) That's one of the many things that made this film so profound.<br />Hilary Swank gave a powerful and convincing performance, and I think she deserved the award she won indefinitely. Chloë Sevigny also gave an excellent performance as the moody, enigmatic and sympathetic Lana, who seemed to have quite a bit underneath her surface. She should have won an award as well. I can't stress these actresses enough (along with the director and film in general.)<br />An excellent, powerful film, this is one of my all-time favorite movies. This review won't do it any justice. It's beautiful, sad, ethereal, poignant, atmospheric and disturbing all at once. I highly recommend it to people who think they can handle this story. Also, check out the documentary called \\"The Brandon Teena Story\\" if you've watched this movie, and wanted more information regarding the story, since this movie was based on that documentary.

B00005JKED|4.0|Denzel Washington pretty much does a first this time around, as he plays a villainous corrupt narcotics detective named Alonzo on the mean streets of Los Angeles. He then takes an ambitious but good-hearted rookie named Jake (played by Ethan Hawke) under his wing, on a tutorial, and shows him the routine of a narcotics detective. However, Alonzo has quite a few obstacles in store for Jake, and not the least of them is witnessing some of Alonzo's brutal police tactics.<br />Joseph Sigmond wrote a very descriptive, in-depth review on January 13, 2003 for this movie. However, I don't really want to spill every single detail on the film and ruin it for somebody who hasn't seen the movie yet, but things twist and turn, and eventually the bad that was done seems to be compensated for (at least on Alonzo's part.) If there was a moral or lesson to be learned on this 'training day,' it seemed to be: you reap what you sow.<br />The scenes and dialogue get quite graphic at times, so I wouldn't advise the faint of heart to view this film. Just a warning. As far as performances are concerned, Washington won an award for his performance in this, as it was a first for him to play an extremely menacing character, and he plays it quite convincingly well. Hawke did an excellent job as the good-hearted rookie, and it was quite interesting seeing his temperamental swing (at the end of the movie) contrasted with the innocence he seemed to portray throughout the movie.<br />While a crime drama, there's plenty of humor found here, but the humor is quite scathingly dark and sinister.<br />Also features appearances from superstars Dr. Dre, Snoop Doggy Dogg and Macy Gray. Most of the time, musicians make appearances in films, and don't leave much of an impression (other than the fact that they're famous), but what's interesting is how well each of these respective musicians' characters fit well into the story, and each give perfectly convincing performances, as opposed to just being objects of show, possibly to attract extra attention to the film. Also features actress Eva Mendes and veteran actor Scott Glenn.s of show, possibly to attract extra attention to the film. Also features actress Eva Mendes and veteran actor Scott Glenn.

B00004ZD69|4.0|Shut up and just listen.  It might not be the best but what the Hell is 'the best' these days?!  It's certainly much more beautiful and adventurous than a lot of junk out there.  You're allowed to enjoy music just for the sake of it.  You're allowed to detach yourself from the world and float in magical melodies.  So why the Hell not just do it without all the 'ifs and buts'.  I think the key to truly enjoying music like this is to just succumb to it.
0385504209|4.0|Yes, this is a fun, fast pager-turner murder mystery, but much more. The elements of the Holy Blood mystery are all laid out here in easily digestable form. Don't make the mistake of thinking that the author is making this up, he's not. You could even look at this book as simply a vehicle for bringing the Holy Blood, Holy Grail mystery to a wider audience. I am surprised no one else mentioned this. Read also Holy Blood, Holy Grail by Baigent et al for a more \\"non-fiction\\" treatment of this subject.<br /><br />P.S. - The author cleverly uses the names \\"Sauniere,\\" \\"Sophie/Sofia\\" and \\"Bezu\\" for main characters in this novel; names that figure into the real mystery.<br /><br />P.P.S. - Yes, I know that a lot of HBHG has been debunked but there are still a lot of threads to follow and a lot of references to real historical events.
6304698798|5.0|\\"For a Few Dollars More\\" is Sergio Leone's best *cinematic* work; But his epic Western \\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\\" is his greatest *work of art.* An audacious undertaking, it would have flopped miserably in any other director's hands. Only someone so commited to his artistic vision as Leone could have pulled off this bombastic pageantry of human nature in all its facets, its capacity for cynicism, greed, bloodlust, revenge, heroism, redemption and honour.<br />This movie must be *experienced.* Put the DVD in, turn the stereo all the way up and let it pummel you from the moment the Lardani titles blast onto the screen in a blaze of Technicolor fury. The montage of colour, interspersed by stark black and white visages of Eastwood, Van Cleef and Wallach is a tough act to follow, like Saul Bass' mesmerising titles for Hitchcock's \\"Vertigo.\\"<br />But, Leone delivers: A pack of killers finally home in on their prey, small-time bandit Tuco Ramirez (THE UGLY, played by the venerable Eli Wallach). They pile through a saloon door, then the camera imediately pans away laterally. Suddenly, his body hurtling through the front window in a rain of glass, Tuco bursts onto the street -- in what has to be the most absurd grand entrance in screen history -- revolver in one hand, a chicken leg in the other. It's total chutzpah on Leone's and Wallach's part.<br />If you think *that* can't be topped, watch Wallach's entire performance. Animated is putting it mildly. More than a performance, Wallach is a one-man band, nay, Army. Never has such a selfish, petty, ratty and shifty little man been played so larger than life. Wallach smirks, scurries, grimaces, chuckles, shouts, bellows and slyly oils his way across the screen in what has got to be the hammiest performance ever by a method actor. Or *any* actor: He makes Orson Welles, Burt Lancaster and Charles Laughton look like the grey and sullen cast of Woody Allen's \\"Interiors,\\" he's so alive with passion that he literally sweats hisperformance out through the filthy pores on his stubble-ridden face. And he's wonderful!<br />If that's a tough act to follow, you haven't met the bad. They don't come any badder than Angel Eyes, Lee Van Cleef's hired killer who's got ice water running through his veins. Van Cleef is ruthless, bold and heartless. Riding out of nowhere onto a doomed man's rancho, Angel Eyes pays a visit, carrying out a murder for hire. The price: $500. But the victim offers him $1000 to look the other way. No dice: Angel Eyes isn't in it for the money. Rather, he's a man who loves his work, and always sees the job through. So, the poor sod dies anyway. <br />Clint Eastwood is as cool as a cucumber as The Man With No Name (but really one with sort of a name, in this case \\"Blondie,\\" which is Wallach's moniker for him). It's fun watching the ongoing relationship between Blondie and Tuco as bounty hunter and prey. In another life, they would have been great pals, but in this life (\\"we're all alone in this world,\\" Tuco confesses to Blondie, half seriously, half cynically) their love of money is thicker than friendship. So, begrudgingly, they invent ingenious and cruel ways to exact revenge of each other. <br />It's during one of Tuco's sadistic plots - in which he marches the pale-skinned Eastwood across 100 miles of scorching desert - that the plot finally comes to a head: A driverless stagecoach full of wounded Confederates happens across their path, and through a twist of fate, Tuco and Blondie each have two halves of a secret which, if put together, will make them a quarter of a million dollars richer. But, without each other the two halves are worthless. Thus does Tuco do a 180 from brutal executioner to Blondie's would-be saviour. Now that he could be rich, he suddenly realizes how valuable their friendship is.<br />It's not before long that they wind up with Angel Eyes, as they're captured by Union soldiers. At the prisoner of war camp, a deadly game of cat and mouse begins. Van Cleef is now more restrained and less thuggish as he deals with Tuco to extract the secret; his henchman Wallace (Mario Brega, a Leone stalwart), pummels it out of Tuco. <br />In epic fashion, after a shootout in a deserted town and a bridge demolition that explodes across the screen, Tuco, Blondie and Angel Eyes make their way to the cemetery where the treasure is buried. In a fanfare of brass, percussion and chorus, the three face each other down in the cemetery plaza. It's a gorgeous and cathartic set piece. Credit must go not only to composer Ennio Morricone but also to musical director Bruno Nicolai, who conducts the score con fuoco.<br />To the German viewer who asks about a complete version: This year, MGM/UA issued a restored 35mm print, which just closed at the Film Forum in Manhattan. First restored in Italian  by Cineteca Nazionale, the English-language restoration was spearheaded by Martin Scorsese, whose efforts with the Film Preservation Foundation have helped fund preservation of America's celluloid heritage. Both Eli Wallach and Clint Eastwood returned to the sound studio to dub new dialogue for approximately 20 minutes of restored footage. Both sound a little older and scratchier, but these added scenes help to explain both Tuco's and Angel Eyes' gangs and some plot points that were previously unclear. However, they both sound great! (Van Cleef's voice was dubbed by a professional voiceover artist, and sounds almost on target). The movie now has the true feel of a sprawling epic, one that's earned its right to take its time. <br />The current DVD includes two of the three major scene additions as bonus material, but only in Italian. Hopefully soon, MGM will  release a new DVD in all its three-hour splendour. Until then, this is well worth watching, giving the viewer a reference point against which to compare the restoration.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|I am a student of Russian, and perhaps it is because of this background that I appreciate the Russian songs much more than their English songs. The English songs lost something in the translation; they have a dry and forced feel. The Russian songs, however, are quite the contrary; they emit depth and spirit. While I thoroughly enjoy this CD, I would recommend their Russian CD for any of those interested - whether you speak Russian or not.
B000003TAB|5.0|Incesticide is a great c.d. Trust me, if you like Nirvana...even slightly, you will love this cd. It combines lots of outtakes and demos and some songs that never made it to the other c.d.s.(Such as Bleach and Nevermind) While not as polished as some of the other Nirvana music, Incesticide's tracks are eerie, dark, and peculiar...three factors that make for great Nirvana.(Listen to Beeswax)I must say one thing, as well...if you are the kind of person who is willing to try new things, and has never heard Nirvana, do yourself a favor and purchase this cd. You won't regret it. This is a great c.d. for any people new to Nirvana. <br />&quot;Long Live Cobain.&quot;

B000002G7E|3.0|WHITE LIGHT/WHITE HEAT is one of the most controversial albums in rock 'n roll history. It is equally revered and reviled. Will you like it or not? Well, if you are a fantastic musician who cherishes mind-blowingly talented artists such as Jimi Hendrix, Cream/Eric Clapton, The Beatles, and Led Zeppelin, you'll view this as an insult; a cheap, worthless piece of garbage released only as exploitation of both your hard-earned pay and its seemingly drug-fueled fans. So it's best you did not even READ the rest of this review. <br />But if you're looking for a guilty pleasure or any kind of perverse entertainment, WHITE LIGHT/WHITE HEAT is your CD. The production is basically non-existent, Lou Reed sings as if he had just toked a doobie (especially on \\"Sister Ray\\"), the guitars are put on amps that must have been stolen by Spinal Tap (they go up to \\"11,\\" probably), and with the exception of John Cale, everyone in the band sounds like they had a couple of lessons on their instruments in 7th grade. Musical proficiency is not the issue; energy, noise, and insults toward rock 'n roll conventions are. This music is trashy, chaotic, and throwaway in its nature. <br />Under the torrents of amplifier feedback, the record does have melodies. The Jerry Lee Lewis-esque title track is a killer stomper; \\"I Heard Her Call My Name\\" does actually have a hook or two; and the quieter \\"Here She Comes Now\\" hints toward the next album. But melody isn't one of the album's assets. Sure, Lou Reed can solo about as good as Britney Spears can sing, but at least he wasn't trying to be good and lets it hang out, especially on \\"Heard Her Call My Name.\\" Sure, him and Sterling Morrison give off mostly waves of feedback on \\"The Gift\\" instead of try to compose a melody. Sure, the outro to \\"Lady Godiva's Operation\\" is downright embarrassing. But it doesn't matter. This 'f*** you!' attitude seriously influenced many later punk bands, not the corporate drek that is Blink-182 or New-Found Glory today. <br />Last, but not least, is \\"Sister Ray,\\" a 17-minute tour-de-force (or unlistenable piece of garbage, depending on your tastes) that is unlike anything labeled rock 'n roll. Sonic chaos is more like it. If you do manage to get through it, you have passed the ultimate endurance test for many music listeners. <br />As I have SERIOUSLY stressed, this record is not for everyone. But if you want to hear it...
B00005JKPF|5.0|Let me say first off that x2 is 10 thousand times better that Matrix Reloaded!THe fight scenes are great the acting is good for an action movie and overall its probably the best movie of the summer.
0385507755|1.0|And that's about it.<br />This criminally overated clunker is as riveting as Brock Landers' steely gaze in Boogie Nights.<br />The \\"technique\\" of following a sentence with a fragment or two or three or four fragments, which is then followed by a single word from said fragment is a very tiresome gimmick, not a means of achieving profundity.<br />The \\"story\\" is uncompelling and contrived: R.P. McMurphy lite (with the Tao Te Ching(!) in his back pocket) and his gaggle of cliche-aracters vs a coterie of woefully ineffectual mental health professionals.  And oatmeal.  And a fat otter.

B00003CWOL|4.0|I give this movie, 3 and a half stars for a good effort. It could have been a 5 star movie if it wasn't for all of it's flaws, to me it seems like it was perhaps put together too quickly without thinking the whole thing through.<BR>    I believe what Kevin Smith was trying to say with his movie is that organized religion is bad. Bad because when it gets into the hands of people it becomes the religion of the people rather than something holy, it becomes manipulated. This idea could have been portrayed in a movie, but this movie is not the one.<BR>    The movie comes off as preachy in some parts, which is very annoying and corny. A lot of the reviewers here are angry that they bash the Catholic religion, but they miss the point that he is bashing all orgainized religion. This is it's main flaw, it does not make this clear for a number of reasons. First, it uses everything from the Bible. So a direct interpetation would be that Kevin Smith is saying that Christian religions have the right idea but they manipulate it...as for all the other religions (budism, hinduism) well they can all go to hell! <BR>     I understand Smith's point but he does not make it clear enough that he is bashing organized religion and not one specific one. Anyone that doesn't believe in the bible can be very offended by the movie because this movie, though some people say 'it makes one search for thier own beliefs', it doesn't. It makes one search for thier own beliefs within the bible. <BR>    I know that Smith was not saying that the bible is the basis of everything with this movie, but like I said, this movie was not thought out well enough. It was flawed.<br />    Like I said, I give it 3 1/2 stars, the reason I show it as four instead of three here is not because I am leaning towards four stars, but because this movie had more than just philosophy to offer. It had comedy, and for that it is a very good movie. I reccomend this movie to anyone who wants a good laugh. It will give you a few!If you don't anylyze the film it can be very enjoyable simply because it is funny.<br />    So to sum everything up: Nice try at having philosophy in your movie Kevin Smith, but it didn't work like you wanted it too. But it was funny. Don't take my word though, go rent it and have a good laugh.
B00006M183|5.0|Pearl Jam has always been known to come out with, if not commercially successful (except for 1992's juggernaut Ten) albums, artistically viable albums. Every single one of their releases has songs which have become memorable in the microcosm of Pearl Jam fans...start talking about the Mamasan trilogy with a couple of fans within earshot and they'll know exactly what you're talking about. Riot Act is no exception, with excellent songs, with equally provoking lyrics, but with no real catchy commercial tune; in other words, no Jeremy, no Betterman, no Elderly Woman. Who needs that? If they kept making the same stuff over and over it wouldn't be exciting to listen to them.<BR>Riot Act displays a band that has become comfortable in its own skin, and shows everyone pitching in with songs. But this doesn't mean Ed Vedder doesn't put his pen to use. There's the philosophical love ballad &quot;Thumbing my Way&quot;, the desperate plea to a wayward friend in the rocker &quot;Save You&quot;, a sarcastic twist on songs like &quot;Bu$hleaguer&quot; and &quot;1/2 Full&quot; (the latter reminds me of the song &quot;Rivals&quot; from the album Binaural). You Are offers an almost '80's throwback with its robot-dance inducing keyboards, and its a fun Pearl Jam song. &quot;I Am Mine&quot; finds the band waxing philosophical about the tragedy at Roskilde as only Pearl Jam knows how: with a great guitar solo and memorable chorus. &quot;Green Disease&quot; and &quot;Get Right&quot; are post-punk type songs, with great frantic melodies which make you doubt the band's looming elder statesmanship in rock. And as always, the closer to the album, All or None, is a perfect way to reflect on not only the album, but yourself. A really well made album.
B000002J09|5.0|That guy from portland should not be allowed to listen to rock.<BR>any one who doesnt see this album or any Zeppelin album for what they are should not listen to rock. If not For Led Zeppelin Rock would not have changed for years. this album set a mile stone that few bands lived up to.
B00006GFAB|2.0|Kiss have a split personality. On the one hand, they have garish, theatrical makeup, lots of fire, and names like Demon and... Catboy or something. But when they start playing, you expect a noise similar to KMFDM or Alice Cooper... not Def Leppard. <BR>    How, and dear god why, have Kiss been going on so long? Their music isn't remotely original, even if thier stage antics are, and not nearly rocky enough to make them the Kings of Rock or whatever the hell they have a reputation for. I think rock and I think the Stones, I think classic Metallica, I think Led Zeppelin.
B00000FCBC|4.0|Astronomy remake,Sabbrah caddabra, whiskey in a jar were all good remakes in this album although i like the orginal artist's versions better. Blue oyster cult, Black Sabbath etc are still some of my favorite CLassic rock and metal bands of all time.I was defitely happy to see that they had their songs on disc 2 that goes back to their good old legendary garage metal days back when it was Hard and True metal. Espically the fact that Am I evil and Blizereig were on here this was great cause i never could find an original copy of Kill em All with these songs on it . I would recommend this album due to several great songs on disc 2 from their early years and also some of their good remakes of good classic rock remake songs on disc 1.
B000002J1Y|5.0|Still Breathtaking Serious Joy<br />Yessongs as a live album was a highly seductive object in the mid-70s.  Singer Jon Anderson and guitarist Steve Howe, with bassist Chris Squire and keyboardist Rick Wakeman had invented a rock music that unfolded like ballet: compositions were episodic, many-colored, loud, and running anywhere between 7 and 25 minutes long. Combined with the triple gatefold sleeve and its tableau of impossible geology in surrealist watercolors, it had a magical impact as a total sensory package.  Anderson's hi-register vocal tone sounds reserved, focused, innocent and yet faraway; a critical quality that made this far out but disciplined music take on the more serious mood one experiences at a symphony hall.  Crucial to Yes' mojo was Steve Howe's variety of guitars, from mandolin, sitar-guitar, pedal steel, traditional acoustic, to several different electric Gibsons: all offered distinct timbres and shades lent specifically to each `drama' the group enacted.  On top of all these, was Howe's idiosyncratic but brilliantly pure playing, sometimes involving three different axes inside the same song!  Rick Wakeman also traveled with a large battery of instruments, constantly calling on different sounds for different pieces.  Chris Squire plays the same trebly Rickenbacker bass for the entire performance but with widely varied texture and attack.  But perhaps the most remarkable player is newly recruited drummer Alan White, who takes all the brittle and mechanical sounding earlier studio versions and makes them flow with funk and life.   With this digitally remastered CD you get improved dynamics over the original analog LP, especially in the bottom end, and clearer hall echo from the Rainbow Theatre in London. On the downside, there are a few unsettling moments of aging tape squeak.  As a live recording, Yessongs has a very satisfying signature: you feel like you are in the second row but you can hear the size of this voluminous music blowing beyond you, into an unrestricted black backdrop.   This aura of space surrounding the imaginary (russian-inspired?) theatre of Yes' wildly virtuosic presentation, completes the recipe for this important live document.  Besides so much uplift from major key anchored songs,  pieces like \\"And You And I\\" and \\"Starship Trooper\\" are delivered with a shattering ecstatic quality that is hard to locate anywhere else in live electric music. On the tour following the release of Close To The Edge, the Yes seemed a force of nature, like no other time in their career.  Nobody had this combination of pithy goodwill and vast unbridled baroque nerve in 1973.
B000002H97|5.0|true most of metallicas' 90s albums were subpar to their &quot;Killem All &quot;thru their &quot;And Justice for all&quot; years but still their self titled black album is a woderful masterpiece. I was introduced to metal back when i was 13 back in 93. i bought this album back in august of 93 when i began loving metal. after i bought this album i backtracked to their early stuff to dig up their root sound and their root sound is awesome i loved it as much as this album. though ride the lightning ,killem all ,and master of puppets R.I.P. Cliff Burton the God of Bass guitars were heavier than the &quot;Black &quot;album they were wonderful metallica albums to say the least . To me the &quot;Black&quot; marked the best of the last  of Metallicas era of masterpieces , Load and reload is their true sellout era  and now with &quot;st anger &quot;their so called return to roots that became their very worst album .I must say the 1991 on back to 1983 yrs of metallica were their truely great years i wish some way ,somehow before they fade to black they could recapture that sound before they retire but it don't look to promising. In closing if you love metallicas great albums get this one its not their heaviest but its one of their legendary great albums.
0451147960|1.0|The plot is weak, the storyline is dull, the characters are shallow, and the writing is mediocre.  There's nothing to this book.  I read the whole thing between taking off from New York and landing in California.  What a disappointment!
B00008J2DQ|5.0|people who down Godsmack for keeping to their roots are saying hey i love this talentless new age linkin park.... i'm glad Godsmack Is staying to thier grindcore grunge metal style now if only Staind would ruturn to their dysfunction roots like Godsmack keeps to their debut album then nu metal would have some music worth hearing. Voodoo from their debut album  i stil listen to as if it just came out so for Godsmack to make new songs with similiar sounds is just music to my ears to me . i'm glad they stuck to thier roots don't change if you can help it conform if you have to but keep the roots of your music intact while doing so standouts in this album are I stand alone and their self titled faceless song. Get this album if you love mainstream rocks heros the ones who make mainstream worth listening to. Good Job keep up the good work
B000002TQV|5.0|I feel glad of having this album, which makes me remember the sound of Coldplay's Parachutes, because of its similarity. It consists in many soft tunes that are very personal, from Thom Yorke's own. With this and the following album he develops so much not only as a great singer, but also as a brilliant lyricist. <BR>Although most people consider Fake plastic trees as the best song in it, I prefer Nice dream. It's so precious! I actually like a lot most of them, because they make you feel special feelings, but mainly this one. I also enjoy very much The Bends, High & dry, Bullet proof, Black star and Street Spirit (you should listen to this one, it's really marvellous). Nevertheless, there are also some weak moments, contained in tracks like Bones, Just or Planet Telex.<BR>To sum up, I can tell you that this album is quite impressive. I recommend to get this one in addition to OK Computer, because they are both so similar in style and highness.
B000002HRE|2.0|Let me just say this album is on the very edge of not worth having. King Nothing is about the only descent song on here. Unforgiven 2 is junk in comparison to the great song unforgiven was on their Black album. there might be one more descent song on the album i forgot to mention. I might go to a pawn shop and by a 3 dollar copy just to see what i missed the off the first time i bought it but from what i remember this album was a true sellout metallica disapointment. I'm sorry James and Lars if you hate me for saying this but THE TRUTH HURTS, and if you hate me then too bad Cliff defenitely don't hate me cause i praised your band back when you played your true style. If you ever get out of this new age conforming junky sound then i will consider you a worthy band like i once did when i considered you my favorite band of all time Like i did back when you were true to Metal.
B000002UR7|3.0|I have heard of this first album and I was fascinated by the single Creep, which is almost a classic right now. Besides, I'm a great Radiohead fan, I love all their albums, so I bought this only one that I didn't have in order to listen what it was about, and now, I've got mixed emotions about it. I must tell I hardly could identify this band with the one of OK Computer, Kid A and so on, and that's because Yorke's own voice sounds different. In addition, the style of this album is different to what Radiohead would create after, since they didn't start making use of a synthesizer till The Bends was released, and what I like most of this band is precisely the use of electronic beats, which can be noticed in the subsequent works. Also, I can't remember such happy tunes like the ones included here in any other albums. So, after some weeks listening, I can't appreciate Pablo Honey more than just listening to it a little. However, the work on the guitars is exceptional. In fact, there are a few great songs, especially Creep, How do you? or Prove yourself. So if you like the band, beware of listening to this album, since you may find it inappropriate for them, but for any other band. If you have never listened to Radiohead, I can tell you sincerely that all the other records do get a very high mark.
B000002H2H|5.0|One can't forget this album its a classic great album in metal history . i absoutely will never put this album away it just plain out rocks forever in a day. It and Master of puppets are my tied at best Metallica Albums of all. Fade to black i want to have played at my funeral cause it really hits my heart. ITs so full of truth. All these songs are wonderful, For whom the bell tolls , Creeping death are all albums you can feel and release anger to the world with its just so raw its flawless in my eyes. this must be what people mean by Black sabbath begining metal and Metallica perfecting it cause their new stuff does not fit this statement in truth. Black sabbath began metal and made metal great. To me Metallica upd the notch in the 80s and 1991 album in the genre of metal to where more listened. I see sabbaths legendary influence in the cliff years of metallica it inhibits all of their music in those years and makes it legendary. TO all you new metallica fans if you want to hear what metal is suppose to sound like and true talent and greatness to a now dyeing band then please buy Metallicas root albums including this one and you will see what great metal is all about.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Thom Yorke is brilliant. Hail to the Thief is yet another beautifully put together piece of work. I listened to the cd in my car for 2 weeks straight before changing it.<br />When I first heard that Radiohead was coming out with a new album and that it was supposed to be another OK Computer I questioned, not with any doubt that they couldn't, but how could they? Then the day that it came out I bought it and was very impressed. Hail to the Thief is another OK Computer, indeed. It is not better or worse than OK Computer. It has a completely different sound, but yet, the same sound as OK Computer.<br />Radiohead has been my favorite band for a couple of years now. Hail to the Thief just made Radiohead completely untouchable by any other band. I can picture myself at any age in my life and listening to this cd.
B000002H6C|5.0|I missed Cliff on this album , true newsted did a good job trying and i do mean trying to live up to CLiffs greatness. I will honestly say that Jason Newsted is a good bassist he did make a great solo effort with Metallica . THe music is heavy and influencial in this album. I&quot;m a diehard CLiff years metallica fan so for me to say all this is saying that this still is a great metallica album. True its not my favorite but its a great album none the less. Blackend has great riffs and lyrics, ONe of course is the very best song on this album. It did show that metallica still had their Roots in them along with some tone down metal as well. This album is great it was defintely one of the last 2 great metallica albums. Newstead did a great job on this album with this legendary band. I owe that to him. He will never in my eyes match cliff Burtons status but I would still defintely recommend this album if you like a lot of the true metallica stuff.
B000092ZYX|5.0|I took one listen to this, and I new it was brilliant. Hail to the Thief is typical of Radiohead's music. Overall, it isnt as good as Ok Computer or revolutionary as Kid A however it is nonetheless a fabulous album. The first 10 songs bring Radiohead's sound out which they produced in Ok Computer, Kid A and Amnesiac. BACKDRIFTS is excellent, and is for the Kid A fans. THERE THERE(best song the album) brings out Ok Computer. Other quality songs include WHERE I END AND YOU BEGIN, and THE GLOAMING. The last few songs are alright, but the first 10 are very good, with a few of them being excellent. Unlike OK Computer, all the songs do not brings cheer class. Nevertheless this is a fantastic album.

0783235666|4.0|I ordered this movie for a film class that I was teaching.  I wanted to show horror, classic horror not the trash that shows up so often today.  <br />I was not disappointed in the movie.  It had my 13 year olds at the edge of thier seats by the end of the movie.  Just goes to show you that Hitchcock can even appeal to the modern, over-exposed students of today.<br />The beginning is longer than expected, however, when the action of the story starts, it snowballs.  The suspense that Hitchcock creates is the best part of the movie with my students trying to guess what is going to happen next and alternatives not matching what is given to them.<br />I would definitely recommend this movie as an alternative to the messes that pass for horror and suspense nowadays.
B000002HMH|3.0|let me begin by saying Black was the last 5 star album Metallica made. This album load isn't terrible but its not vintage great metallica neither. their are some descent songs on this album. Hero of the day is a descent song, Until it sleeps is a descent song. I would say several of these songs are worth listening to they do have some good sound to them but their not great. I won't dog My once favorite Metallica band too bad on this review i have listend to this album from time to time but just wait till you hear my reload and st anger review .TO Hear true great Metallica buy their first 5 albums starting with Kill em ALL thru their Self Titled Black Album to hear the legendary great Metal sound of this once Wonderful group.
0385504209|4.0|This is a great work of fiction.  A fun book to read, and very well written.  Dan Brown keeps you in suspense for the first three-quarters of the book with fast pacing, quick editing, and an engrossing tale!  The book is truly hard to put down as the clues are revealed slowly - always just out of reach.  I resisted the temptation to read ahead often.  Sadly, I was disappointed that the ending wasn't better, but perhaps that's because the agenda of the author became increasingly clear as the book progressed.<br />At last we have a good book about the tired old premise of the Knights Templar and Mary Magdalene, and the secret society. However, just when he was really moving with the story I about fell out of my chair laughing when all of a sudden some of the truly comical books on this premise are woven into the story as if they mean something. On page 253 he mentions one book prominently: The Templar Revelation.  This is a truly hilarious book, and unlike The Da Vinci Code, it fails to actually admit it is fiction and tries to pass itself off as scholarly research and therefore fails miserably.  See my review of the book here on Amazon.com. On page 267 he weaves in another work of fiction called: The Greatest Story Ever Sold.  But again, unlike Mr. Brown, the other works are not nearly as well written, and are simply bad docu-dramas.  His not so subtle theological agenda is woven into what is otherwise a great fictional mystery.  He quotes some of the Gnostic Gospels that have been clearly depicted as frauds by most Biblical scholars of any merit.<br />Unfortunately, Mr. Brown gradually lets go of the fictional story he starts with and it seems he actually believes what he is writing.  The first clue that this is truly a work of fiction is before the prologue where he tries to make his fiction look like fact.  On the top of page 234 he gives the sad worldview of the Jesus Seminar.  Also, as mentioned, he tries to incorporate other works to make it look like his premise is founded on something more than \\"X-File\\" level conspiracy nonsense.  This is unfortunate because he is obviously a talented writer, and has written the best book on the subject yet - a mystery, a fictional tale, and a fun conspiracy story.<br />A fun book to read - so four stars!  Well written, and despite the theological nonsense he tries to weave in as fact, it is a good work of fiction.  Well done!like his premise is founded on something more than \\"X-File\\" level conspiracy nonsense.  This is unfortunate because he is obviously a talented writer, and has written the best book on the subject yet - a mystery, a fictional tale, and a fun conspiracy story.<br />A fun book to read - so four stars!

B00002Z88D|4.0|The only reason i like this album is because of the blend of metallicas legendary 80's and Black album songs mixed with the orchestra. these blended well in my ears opinion to creative a suprisingly innovative sound. hero of the day even sounded good on this album with the mix, what i didn't like is the mix of Metallicas newer songs mixed with the orchastra, which of course i don't like anyways , like Devils dance and songs like that i could live without them for sure. IF you like innovation and like the older pre 1996 songs metallica mastered and made great mixed with the orchestra to form a unique but good sound then i would recommend this album. The Call to Ktulu (1984 ride the lightning) song sounds amazingly good with the ochestra.

B000002H33|5.0|I must say like many that the loss of cliff burton was major to the metal industry. R.I.P to the God of the bass guitar. he left early but on a great note he helped complete a major masterpiece in this Master of Puppets album. This is true Metallica. And this can never be repeated by any band. the True greatest the CLiff years brought to Metallica were wonderful points in Metal history as we know it. If you love Metal and the True roots of Metallica then please get this album you will certainly not regret it.

B000066NW0|1.0|people say that she's an individual and she's different from the rest, but someone who follows the trend of &quot;hot topic&quot; -esque clothes, and sings supposedly &quot;punk&quot; music like  8/10ths of the artists on MTV is by no means an individual of this era of music.  bland, and disgustingly immature - not worth your money.  please, this is just another form of mainstream music to generate money by feeding to the popular trends of the teenage generation of today.
0452279488|5.0|What a fabulous love story, this is one of my favorite books.  The story centers on a letter to Goat from Ram - the letter, of course, is received by the wrong person.   The story takes off from there and there is love everywhere for everyone.  It is a delightful and quick and easy read.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|It doesn't get much better than this for an all out ridiculous comedy about college kids.  A true classic among John Belushi fans!!!
B00008OWZC|4.0|Zepplin was a great live band and these CDs capture some really good sets.  To me, however, there is some less than stellar meandering on these CDs.  The just released DVDs, on the other hand, have very little excess, and you get the visual impact of perhaps the greatest live rock and roll band ever.<br />Much of the early Zepplin live shows were excellent, creative, fresh, and which, for want of a better word, involved some experimentation, that involved some long versions of songs indeed.  I, apparently unlike most people, would rather see one of the later shows, which, as I recall, were a bit tighter and more focused.<br />This is not to say that these are not great CDs.
B000000JO3|5.0|I first heard Minor Threat in 1990. My friend had the \\"Out Of Step\\" ep cassette. I had heard of them, but never really looked into them. After one listen I was hooked. I wasn't straightedge at the time, but years later I would come to grips with what a real and honest lifestyle it is. I was undergoing the same sort of daily angst that Ian was when he penned these songs. I realized that the movement he basically started was in-line with my present thoughts. Every song on here is awesome.  There are songs like \\"Filler\\" where you get goosebumps from the anger and passion and there are songs like \\"Look Back and Laugh\\" which really make you think about how our relationships change over time. There are even funnier songs that are just great to sing along to. Minor Threat was awesome because they could joke around and still be about something positive. They could write a song that would rip you up and they could write another that would bring you back and make you smile...one after the other. This is the whole package. Every band in the punk/hardcore genre should be this sincere and real. One of the reviewers said that this is a \\"joke\\" because punk isn't about making rules to follow. No, punk is about living against the predetermined norm. What is more punk than being yourself? What is more punk and real than seeing the madness around you and not partaking in it? Nothing. Minor Threat was the first band to really get it. Another reviewer said that straightedge kids are \\"discriminating hypocrites\\". Most of us are hypocrites. And all of us discriminate on some levels. Not all sxe kids are going to stick to their words, but then again how many religious folks really follow their oaths and dogma? Not many.  I am proud to say that at 28 I have been sxe for over 8 years now. I do discriminate...I believe living real and clean is the right way to live. Of course, this is my opinion and this is my life. This got off on a bit of a rant here, but the lowdown is just that this album is amazing. It can motivate people and create something positive where only negative things live. Fast, emotional, real, powerful, punk, straightedge...this is the best of the best!is amazing. It can motivate people and create something positive where only negative things live. Fast, emotional, real, powerful, punk, straightedge...this is the best of the best!
B00008PX8P|5.0|These are so good, I am not even sure what to write.  Led Zepplin was not my very favorite group, but they did some sterling work and put on a truly aweinspiring live show.  These DVDs are sterling work and capture, in a way that I have never seen film do it as well, aweinspiring live shows.<br />The only thing that bothers me is the content of the review that indicates that the was a lot of manipulation of the video, changing around sequences and such within songs.  Knowing that makes these DVDs seem a bit slick and produced.  But, otherwise, this is the best live rock film or video material I have ever seen.  The two DVDs are a bargain.  Even if you are not a big Led Zepplin fan, I would think there is plenty here for nearly every rock fan to to enjoy and watch repeatedly.<br />I did see Zepplin live in the day, and these DVDs really capture what it was all about.  One drummer, one guitarist, one bassist (organist/mandolin player) and a vocalist, on a simple stage, who could utterly fill a hall and capture an audience.  The world's greatest live rock and roll band was surely never the Rolling Stones (although, the Stones may have been the greatest rock band).  It was either Led Zepplin, The Who, or Bruce Springsteen.  And there has never been video document near the equal for the latter two that these DVDs are for Zepplin.  And I do not think that even Springsteen is putting out the kind of show he was in say 1980.  I do not know how this kind of magic really comes about, or why it is or isn't sustained, but it is captured on these DVDs.<br />A major plus to the DVDs is to be able to see up close just how good the musicianship is--Page and Bonham.  (I agree that Jones is sort of relegated to the shadows, but I think Jones himself has said that the theatre of the show was really Plant and Page.)  I think Plant is fantastic on these DVDs, too.  This is not easy music to make, and he sings very true to the recorded versions with power, precision, and emotion.  To me,here he is the epitome of the charismatic rock god.  He is for the most part just standing on the stage, but his presence is palpable. <br />I have lots of bootleg Zepplin audio.  I liked the &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; CDs, but not as much as I thought I would. <br />I thought I had had pretty close to my fill of these songs, as wonderful as they are.  But I have watched or had these DVDs on in the background over and over since I bought them.
B000003TA2|4.0|I have a number of &quot;Sonic Youth&quot; albums, and though each one is good for different reasons, this is my favorite front to back. It is easy to like and to listen to, but still keeps the punk/noise edge that other albums have had. Naturally the bridge between &quot;Daydream Nation&quot; and &quot;Dirty&quot;, so similar to each album. Excellent songs like &quot;Kool Thing&quot;, &quot;Tunic(Song for Karen)&quot;, &quot;Dirty Boots&quot;, and &quot;Titanium Expose&quot; from the &quot;Pump up the Volume&quot; soundtrack. Fans of &quot;Dinosaur Jr&quot;, &quot;Pixies&quot;, and &quot;Nirvana&quot; order now.
B00008NG5V|5.0|This album is simply a must have. Having been a fan of Jack Johnson before anyone had even heard of him, I really enjoyed this album. So many musicians in todays day and age think that they must fit to a certain \\"stereotype\\" of music...anymore all the music seems the same. But Jack Johnson is different from all of the mainstream music. He's definetely a standout, and this album proves it. It's an album that you can pop in after a long day at work and just kick back to and relax...definetely a must have!!!
B00000295Y|4.0|Generally regarded as their best album, everything does come together on \\"Black Sunday\\". The lyrics are good, the beats are tight, and B-Real's delivery is more unique than annoying. And as \\"House of Pain\\" were rappin' about beer, it's all [grass] on this one. Some of the best smoking anthems since the \\"Easy Rider\\" soundtrack. Unfortunately, I don't think they've had much else to say for a few years. Might be time for that \\"Hits\\" album, (no pun intended). Check out their debut and \\"Skull and Bones\\" too.
B000001DV2|2.0|If there's any fan of DefLep from the &quot;High and Dry&quot; and &quot;Pyromania&quot; who likes this album, please step forward and seek medical attention.  I suppose if you came to DefLep at &quot;Hysteria&quot; you might think this is more along those lines, and a good album -- but even then, I don't see it ... since Hysteria was still actually pretty solid, and this is, for the most part, purely awful, Michael Bolton material.  Let's Got Rocked is a pretty good tune, and it goes downhill from there.<br />The ballads that are in here helped DefLep stay on the charts, but compare in no way to &quot;Bringing on the Heartbreak&quot; or even the likes of the song &quot;Hysteria&quot; itself.  They are embarassing.<br />DefLep came back to redeem themselves with some real cool tracks on later albums - which I wasn't sure was possible. But this is the only DefLep album I do not own.
0767814622|5.0|I think this movie was a masterpiece. It displays the Turks for what they are. Deceivers, liars and barberic butchers. They are the kings of taking bribes which is accurately portrayed in the movie. A perfect modern example of Turkish black mail is when the US wanted to use Turkish military bases for the Gulf War. The Turks practically wanted to rape the US financially. The Turks are barbarians who butchered the Armenian race back in 1915. If you know anything about history you will know the \\"real\\" story which in Greece and other European Countries they have a Armenian Genocide Day that remembers the victims of Turkish slaughter. The Armenian Genocide is not taught in Turkish schools because it is forbidden. The Armenian Geneocide is the forgotten Genocide especially here in the US. Enough said about the Turks. Back to the movie. This true to life movie was made possible by the brilliant film making of Alan Parker. He definiteley shows the audience how brutal and merciless the Turkish people are through the characters such as the Billy's Turkish lawyer, prison guard and cell-mate Rifky.All three characters potray what real Turks in power are really like.You have to understand there is some truth in film making whether it is Hollywood or not. Parker displays it effectively. Irene Miracle who plays Susan plays a gorgeous, loyal girlfriend is totally believable. The reason why Billy Hayes wanted to \\"apologize\\" for some inaccuracies in the movie is because he was pressured by a Turkish lobby in Washington to do so. He also probably got his life threatened by barbaric Turks through prank phone calls. It probably was the same Turkish lobby that denies and blocks the Armenian Genocide. Billy Hayes,Alan Parker and the cast and crew, in my opinion, should be an honorary Armenians. God Bless them and the courage they had to write this book and make it into a screenplay. The cast and crew should be congratulated that this movie still sparks interest after more than twenty years.The movie is brilliant and 100% TRUTHFUL!!![.]
