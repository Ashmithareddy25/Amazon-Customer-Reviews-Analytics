145210655X|5.0|I grew up with star wars. Han Solo was my hero for years. When I saw this book, I thought it would be another piece of trash thing to suck more money out of fans. I was wrong. It is a very humorous book written for serious fans of the movies that was still...probably written to suck more money out of fans. But I loved it. It's a coffee table book of illustrations...comic book style. Not a long book. But, it's nice to have around. I have looked at it several times in the past few months.

B002JVWRAO|5.0|I have watched this show since episode 1. Been in love with it ever since. Season 5 had me gripped all the way till the end...I watch it every night it's on the CW, then order the season just to own it and watch it again. LOVE IT!<br /><br />HOWEVER...When I received season 5, brand-spankin' new, I discovered the 6th disk was scratched in a few different places. Has anyone else had this problem?
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I haven't tried the Ultraviolet part of this but the film is an incredible story with top rate CG. I highly recommend this for the family movie collection. Seller was perfect with packaging and on time delivery... Thank you, I hae added this seller to one of my favorites.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|I think this movie received way too much bad press. From start to finish I didn't stop laughing! I would watch this movie regardless of what people say.
6305428042|5.0|This is a great story with very talented actors. I could watch this any time of the year. Seller was very good about packaging and receiving in a quick manner. It's PG so it's good for all ages...
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|great movie tom cruise plays a regular guy and helps a person who's not his friend.<br />again great movie enjoy.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I had not heard of this movie before I purchased it. Incredible film and movie with everything looking real. The seller was great at packageing and delivery on time... I highly recommend this for family film night, probably should not show to kids under 12.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|One of Cruise's best films! A must see action thiller. The support cast is top notch, worthy of a 10!
B004UPANGM|4.0|I had forgotten about these movies and only recalled the last one that I thought was spoofy but good. It is great to see the difference in how horror movies are today and how they were then. Of course this movie pretty gruesome but the use of clamation and older use of effects is interesting and sort of silly. Amazing to see how far we have come. There are some great moments of comic relief which I find entertaining in horror films.

B00CJ32S74|2.0|I knew what this soundtrack was going in to it, and I'll admit that I purchased it mainly for the Lana Del Rey and Florence tracks.  Overall, this just wasn't very good.  The will.I.am and Fergie songs that seem to be the centerpiece of this soundtrack are just awful.  The Jay-Z tracks aren't horrible, but they don't seem to fit.  I was very excited to see what Andre 3000 and Beyonce did with &#34;Back to Black&#34; and apparently they just fell asleep and put something out that was even more confused and awkward than Winehouse's infamous live performance.  The Jack White track was interesting, but I already had it from the Achtung Baby cover album (which is far better).
B00CJ32S74|5.0|Watched the movie,  read the book years ago.  Nothing helps you relive the moment like music.  Recommend to add to your music collection

B005CRQ3H0|3.0|Crime novels are plot driven. One does not write a good thriller disregarding this very basic rule. Although I enjoyed Pynchon's 70's era Los Angeles I thought the book could have been a lot better with some rigorous editing and sticking to telling a story. As that didn't happen it took me forever to finish this book with the ending itself dragging endlessly.
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|For anyone growing up in the sixties, the harmony of Crosby, Stills and Nash was an integral part of the music scene.  &#34;Carry On&#34; highlights the wonderful voice and talent of Stephen Stills.  There are the familiar hits we have all heard plus never before pieces that give listeners a whole new view of Stills. It is simply a delight which one could (and does) listen to repeatedly.  Thank you for the experience.

B008J34466|5.0|This is one of my favorite pink albums<br /><br />Even though packaging was poor it works fine and I am happy with the cd.
B000002A3T|5.0|The Division Bell is a classic and overlooked by fans. It's a bit lighter and less rock oriented but still very powerful and still original. It's actually not bad lyrically but it's much better musically. I'm a huge fan of Pink Floyd from their early psychedelic rock with Syd Barrett to their final days in the mid '90s. '70s is without a doubt, their best era but they had good stuff afterwards and it was generally overlooked. The Final Cut was another misunderstood album and put down by fans for it being too depressing. It wasn't an album for the radio though, it was a darker and more creative side to the band. Momentary Lapse Of Reason and Division Bell have some of the dark themes but were much lighter after the departure of Roger Waters. Momentary Lapse of Reason was an excellent album also but I prefer The Division Bell. In my opinion, it's their best work since 1979's The Wall.<br /><br />Highlights: High Hopes, Keep Talking, What Do You Want From Me?, Wearing The Inside Out, Marooned
B005XQXFG2|1.0|The packing was too big.<br /><br />The box had no bubble wrap or anything.<br /><br />The dvd is an hour and 40 minutes and I dont care but if it stalls and does a freeze phrame after 25 minutes<br />unacceptable<br /><br />I returned this dvd with express so shipping was 30 dollars not 15 just for a refund in the PROPER WAY WITH BUBBBLE WRAP ENVELOPE AND FORMS NEEDED!!!!<br /><br />I would like a replacement!!!!

B000VSAEYI|4.0|Pool is a perfect size for my 2 year old! I purchased the intex pump so it saved me the hassle of blowing everything up. My only complaint is the palm tree deflates after a few hours and I have to repump the pool every couple days. The best part of this pool is the hose attachment for the pool's built in sprinkler, it makes the slide extra slippey and my toddler loves to slide on it!

B005LAIIJY|1.0|I am no prude, but I have never experienced a movie that was so totally offensive as this one.<br />Every other word was either the &#34;f&#34; word or the &#34;n' word..<br />Possibly the worst movie ever.

B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|A truly wonderful film(series) with great cast members and terrific story lines. Bravo!!!<br />Could not have loved it more. I will watch this over and over.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I love this movie, so that's why I bought it.  It's a great movie with a dynamic cast and a funny and heart warming tale of two people looking for a siver lining.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This really is a great little game. Perfect for passing 5 minutes or less. I have encountered no bugs or issues with the game, although I do wish my Note II's stylus worked on it, sometimes my fingers are so clumsy!<br /> I love trying to break my own records. I have managed puzzle mode in-no lie- 2:50! My husband and I joke that there should be achievements in the game, like \\"Tunnel through to the other side without moving the cube\\"... things like that. Really though, for it's simplicity, it is a fun and very pretty to look at game. Cube attack mode frustrated me at first until I finally figured it out and now I play it quite often. Want to beat your puzzle mode record? Play Cube Attack a couple of times, then play puzzle mode. You'll love the result.<br /><br />Fun game, highly recommend.
B009S6ZKSO|5.0|It is a perfect compliment to a fan and the bonus DVD is a plus. A very talented artist with very appealing sound
B006M4F67A|5.0|Very easy to use. Always challenging your brain. Very fun to play. Great for passing time wherever you are. Very addicting so watch out. You might just find this is hard to stop playing. I have to say I have played several versions and this one is well worth the money.

1594487154|2.0|As a salesman (somebody whose job is to persuade and convince, according to this book), I appreciate the author's effort to elevate the importance and significance of sales jobs back to the right level, and to help salespersons to enhance their selling skills. Nevertheless, he had tried too hard to put so much information and coin so many terms in this book, that except the following two examples below: \\"I am blind\\" vs \\"It's springtime and I am blind\\" and \\"Pick up after your dog\\" vs \\"Children play here. Pick up after your dog\\", I can hardly recall anything else at all from it. \\"A whole new mind\\" is one of my all time favorites. Pardon me for saying that this book really disappointed me.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This is the best bingo game I have played. The one thing that they could do is give more shadow cards out that you can't buy.

B00846REIS|5.0|Everyone compares this book to 50 shades. And although the story line may be similar I much prefer this book series to 50 shades. I love everything about Gideon and Eva. This book is hot! It's a must read if you like hot sex scenes and a wild passionate man full of secrets.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I LOVE The Hunger Games!!!!!!! It's a stunning book! If you like survival books or television shows, even both, this is the book for you.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I may be biased because Gideon will forever be my favorite. But I have yet to find a book series I love more than this one. I can't wait for it to continue
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This game is easy and challenging.  So simple and repetative but yet very addicting for some odd reason.  Worth a try.
B008602KQI|5.0|The book was great and I feel like they did a good job bringing the book the the big screen.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|It happens more often than not when a novel is better than the movie.  I did wonder as I read it how a particular part of the book would be shot in the film.  After seeing the movie I know how they did it.  They just left it out.  This is a great read.

B00AEFY3DQ|5.0|As a  Star Trek Fan this is just one film that has to be in all trek lovers collection. Tim Allen's performance of a William Shatner like Captain is priceless. The rest of the cast is great as well.
B003U4ZQRK|5.0|it really is. One and two are excellent, but five was just so much fun. Time travel really makes everything better.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This book was a fantastic surprise. Mark Watney is a very compelling everyman-type slash Macguyver in Space and you can't help but root for him. Great pacing, very grounded science, and fairly believable politics made this a great read. I would have given the book 5 stars but there were quite a few editing errors in the version I read. I hope those errors are corrected soon. Without them, The Martian would fit in with the best from Bradbury or Heinlen.
B003U53GK8|2.0|I love this show. I have re-watched it with every girl I dated as a way to see....  Well, this time is the first time with season 6 added in, and although she is hooked, I am bored and hate the flash-whatever they are pulling this season. Its great to have questions answered, but otherwise a pretty disappointing season.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|Seriously.. This movie was robbed when it came to the reward season.. This was by far the best directed and edited film of 2012. The story is complex, original, moving, and streamed together seamlessly through its themes.. I frankly don't know HOW this team made this film. This is a sign of master craftsmen doing astounding work. This is stunning and truly well made. I can't recommend it enough.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|I have this game for my Kindle Fire HD.This is a really fun, entertaining, time passing game. It has good graphics, and the 3D effect where you can walk around town taking cars is awesome!!! But I wish there was multiplayer mode. That would be so cool. DOWNLOAD THIS GAME!!!!!!!

B002G1YPH0|5.0|Here's the thing, I'd upload my stress tests if I could but speedfan doesn't allow for exporting of their graph data, so here's a quick rundown:<br /><br />Applied WAY too much thermal past at first, idled at ~40*C<br />Removed some, allowing some time to harden and leaving too little in some areas (my bad!) hovers at ~25-33*C idling.<br /><br />When playing CPU intense games (multiple AI, physics, and/or many doodads and other land objects that need real-time anything), it's anywhere from 45-55*C at any time, though I'd average it around 50*C<br /><br />For games like Farcry 3 (most especially Dishonored) core 1 seems to light up and stay in the 50*C+ range, while the other cores and the CPU itself move between 25-55*C.<br /><br />This is springtime bordering on summertime and I've taken great pains to ensure my room is almost refrigerator cold (and not just because I love the cold).<br /><br />I had tested it one day when my room was warm, and noticed the temperatures rise ~5-8*C on average. Which is about where they were before. So maybe this is all a big placebo effect.<br /><br />However, as a matter of fact, I've used this same Cooler-CPU combo since I built and got working my current machine back in late 2009 early 2010, and it's never failed me before. Only recently have I become tech-savvy and tech-aware enough to bother checking stats, but it's never even hiccuped in all that time.<br /><br />As another matter of fact, the only reason I got new coolers (and incidentally a new CPU of the same type) was for diagnostic purposes. For all intents and purposes, the old CPU AND cooler still work.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Edit as of 6/10/2013<br /><br />Apparently speedfan DOES have a log option, here's the log of today. An average, but slightly cool, summer day.<br /><br />This is with little load, as I have not played any games. My original review is pretty spot on though, they rise ~15 degreesFahrenheit depending on the game and whatever parts are being used and at what level of use (low/med/high).<br /><br />Seconds GPU CPU CPU Core 0 Core 1 Core 2 Core 3<br /><br />0 29.0 38.0 37.0 35.0 33.0 35.0 32.0<br />3 29.0 39.5 37.0 39.0 35.0 38.0 32.0<br />6 29.0 39.0 37.0 38.0 36.0 39.0 35.0<br />9 29.0 39.0 37.0 38.0 37.0 39.0 33.0<br />12 29.0 39.5 37.0 38.0 37.0 41.0 33.0<br />15 29.0 40.5 37.0 40.0 36.0 38.0 34.0<br />18 29.0 39.0 37.0 39.0 37.0 40.0 33.0<br />21 29.0 40.0 37.0 38.0 34.0 42.0 32.0<br />25 29.0 40.0 37.0 40.0 36.0 41.0 33.0<br />28 29.0 41.0 37.0 38.0 36.0 42.0 33.0<br />31 29.0 41.5 37.0 38.0 37.0 40.0 33.0<br />34 29.0 39.5 37.0 38.0 37.0 39.0 35.0<br />38 29.0 39.5 37.0 40.0 38.0 40.0 34.0<br />40 29.0 40.5 37.0 38.0 38.0 39.0 32.0<br />43 29.0 41.5 37.0 39.0 35.0 42.0 33.0<br />46 29.0 40.5 37.0 39.0 37.0 39.0 33.0<br />49 29.0 39.5 37.0 41.0 36.0 38.0 34.0<br />52 29.0 41.5 37.0 39.0 37.0 40.0 34.0<br />55 29.0 41.5 37.0 38.0 39.0 39.0 33.0<br />58 29.0 41.0 37.0 38.0 38.0 40.0 33.0<br />61 29.0 39.5 37.0 39.0 38.0 39.0 36.0<br />64 29.0 39.5 37.0 40.0 36.0 39.0 34.0<br />67 29.0 39.5 37.0 40.0 38.0 40.0 34.0<br />70 29.0 40.5 37.0 39.0 36.0 39.0 35.0<br />73 30.0 40.0 37.0 39.0 38.0 41.0 34.0<br />77 29.0 41.5 37.0 38.0 36.0 42.0 33.0<br />80 29.0 41.5 37.0 39.0 36.0 41.0 35.0<br />83 29.0 41.0 37.0 39.0 36.0 43.0 33.0<br />86 29.0 41.5 37.0 38.0 37.0 39.0 33.0<br />89 29.0 43.5 37.0 39.0 37.0 43.0 33.0<br />92 29.0 41.5 37.0 39.0 39.0 39.0 33.0<br />95 29.0 40.5 37.0 38.0 39.0 38.0 34.0<br />98 29.0 42.5 37.0 39.0 38.0 40.0 34.0<br />102 29.0 42.0 37.0 39.0 36.0 42.0 34.0<br />104 29.0 42.5 37.0 38.0 36.0 42.0 34.0<br />107 29.0 40.5 37.0 39.0 36.0 43.0 33.0<br />110 29.0 42.0 37.0 39.0 38.0 40.0 35.0<br />113 29.0 41.5 37.0 38.0 36.0 43.0 33.0<br />116 29.0 40.0 37.0 41.0 36.0 39.0 34.0<br />119 29.0 40.0 37.0 38.0 38.0 41.0 35.0

B007MU85D0|5.0|Nanna Brynd&iacute;s Hilmarsd&oacute;ttir has similar vocal ability and good looks of Paramore singer Hayley Williams.  The male co lead singer Ragnar &#34;Raggi&#34; Þ&oacute;rhallsson has similar vocal ability to Fall Out Boy's Patrick Stump.  Combine the two and you get one hell of a band.  They also play unorthodox instruments like the trumpet and accordion.  Not to mention the drummer is as talented as the best drummers out there.  The whole band can be described as a magical mixture of montrous talent.  The lyrics are also very well written and relatable.  Of Monsters and Men is the best thing to come out of Iceland since Bj&ouml;rk.  They are also a band that really kills it live (check out some of their live performances).<br /><br />Finally, it is great to know that this is just the start for Of Monsters and Men.

B00C5ZORES|5.0|Save Rock And Roll is similar to their previous CDs in that it sounds almost nothing like their previous CD's.  Save Rock and Roll is an epic collection of songs that cover many different subgenres of rock.<br /><br />Every song on the album represents a different subgenre of rock. They are saving ALL rock:<br /><br />1.Phoenix-80s HardRock Ex/Kiss<br />2.Light em up- NuMetal Ex/Linkin Park<br />3.Alone Together-PopRock Ex/Maroon 5<br />4.Where Did The Party Go-PopPunk Ex/Blink182<br />5.Just One﻿ Yesterday-Rock Ballad Ex/Journey<br />6.Mighty Fall-RapRock Ex/Gym Class Heroes<br />7.Miss Missing You-GlamRock Ex/Poison<br />8.Death Valley-70s Rock Ex/Queen<br />9.Young Volcanos-IndieRock Ex/Fun<br />10.Rat A Tat-Punk Ex/Pearl Jam<br />11.Save R&R-Soft Rock Ex/Billie Joe<br /><br />Only bad part is that they got rid of the long song titles.  Though they were funny, they did make it hard to remember what song was which.<br /><br />The real standout on this album that you will grow to appreciate is Save Rock and Roll with Elton John.  Perhaps its the real reason why the CD is titled Save Rock and Roll.  They got to work with everyone they wanted on this album including Elton John.<br /><br />Best part about this CD might be that they are making a music video for each song on the album.  Be sure to check them out as they are released.<br /><br />Lastly, Pete is an underrated lyrical genius and his often cryptic, eccentric lyrics shine again.
B005K17RU0|3.0|I never used it much so I can't say a lot about it. Since it came on the desktop of my pad I thought I would give it a try.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|Great freaking organic sounding song, perhaps the best on the album.  It sums up what most of the album is.  Guest vocalists with the electric sound and funk of Daft Punk.  The song is really great when it breaks down at the end and Daft Punk performs the chorus in their robotic voice.  Daft Punk is the original anonymous EDM band.  Coming off an amazing Tron Album you will not be disappointed by Get Lucky and their other songs.
B006M4F67A|3.0|Hard to decipher the symbols.  They are hard to read and so small.  I would play it more if it wasn't so much work to read it.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Loved the fast delivery on the movie. If you love the \\"Twilight Saga\\" you will enjoy the 1st part of Breaking Dawn. Loved watching it. Bella and Edward story is well written showing how truly romantic and fated they are in this 1st part of the Breaking Dawn chapter. It also has behind the scenes audio commentary with director Bill Condon. Bella and Edward's personal wedding video! Jacob's destiny and Edward FF and Jacob FF. [Favorite scenes!] I highly recommend for any fan of the twilight series.
B000AP04FG|5.0|Had forgotten how good this movie was.  Ordered the DVD, and it is awesome.  Angelina and Brad were superb together, probably why they hooked up, LOL.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I found this movie visually pleasing and pretty close to the book. It was also easy to follow if you didn't read the book.

0307951529|4.0|What an eye-opening book!  Chris Guillebeau, I'm pretty sure, is living my life, or at least the one I dream about.  He travels the world and makes money, all at the same time.  And he shares his story, and others' stories, so his readers can enjoy the same kind of lifestyle.  If they're willing to take the leap, which I'm not.  BUT, if I didn't have a great job and didn't live near my family and was maybe twenty years younger, I'd have started doing some of the things he suggested before I finished the book.<br /><br />Good thing I bought this for my daughter (I frequently read books before giving them away as gifts) as she's about twenty years younger than I am, so maybe she'll take off and fly with Chris's ideas.  I especially liked his focus on microbusinesses, and maintaining a business with only one or two people while traveling whenever possible.<br /><br />If you're looking for an inspiring book, if you need some micro-entrepreneurial motivation, or if you'd just like to learn how the lucky, adventurous people live, read this book!
B001K3EXTA|5.0|love this movie, the splendor, the plots, the intrigue, an excellent rendition of the novel. now looking forward to seeing the remake. hope it comes close to the original

Whether Kalinda will stay as well with the firm and if Will and Alicia is going to make a go at it.  Is Alicia going to leave her husband.  I love the legal aspect of the show.  Excellent TV show.  I really miss seeing it!!!
B0054SMID0|3.0|Nothing extremely memorable, but a good way to kill a couple of hours. I would recommend it, McConaughey fans should enjoy it.

B009PK9SB8|4.0|Snaps right in, comes with its own case door, and a spare.  Decent enough color and clarity to show off what I've been up up.  it does burn through some battery though, and the touch input isn't as good as my phone or tablet, but passable.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I can't wait to see more episodes.  When do they air more from this excellent series.  If you know the previous movies, you'll love this new series.

B002VECM6S|1.0|This film makes me sick.Mike is portrayed as an ignorant,big dumb ape.Sj and mike sing bust-a-move in the car made me vomit so over the top and cheesy.The black people in this movie are portrayed like evil beasts.Black kid from the ghetto saved by the white family.Real feel good story to who?Something is sick and wrong with this country if people can watch a movie like this and think nothing is wrong here.The safe negro non threatening athlete is the only role hollywood seems to think mainstream movie watchers will like.This movie is such a pile of garbage so please save yourself from having this burned in your memory bank.
B00C2VIA52|3.0|Nice graphics.<br /><br />any free to play game comes with its grinding element. Prepare yourself for that.<br /><br />The game's mechanics are sound but ultimately derivative. Some things are greatly simplified for the sake of accessibility but there is still enough there for tcg players.<br /><br />Like many trading card games, one has to try it to see if they like it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was a very fun and complex game and thoroughly enjoyed the tasks and the thinking that you had to do. I would recommend this game for those who love a challenge.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|This is her best  album i like  all of the songs my favorite ones are  Heart Attack  and Made In The USA and Neon Lights and Really Don't Care and Warrior and Something  That We're Not and Two Pieces :)

0143119680|3.0|The first 3/4 of this book are highly predictable. Matthew is your typical run-of-the-mill over protective vampire who is trying to control his instincts while remaining celebate with his non vampire girlfriend, who is a plain Jane but smarter than average and super sporty but also clumsy.<br />I just wanted to finish this, to get it over with. I knew what was coming with Diana and Matthew's relationship(who didn't from their first encounter?)<br />The last chapter or 2 got a little interesting, but I'm just not sure if I can take another novel yet 2 of this firey love that was meant to change the world. I've been there read that.<br />When it comes to vampires and witches I want something that is thrilling, scary and UN-predictable. Vampires don't always need to be so charming and irresistable.<br />A little more action please?
B0027MJU00|2.0|I try to read every book all the way through to honor an author's effort, but this one really taxed my patience. True to the title, this book is a dark, dark study.  The various story lines are all filled with disgusting, awful people leading dead-end, destructive lives filled with senseless behaviors.<br /><br />The characters were all losers, whether they were victims, aggressors, wastrels, or fools.  The author did use good foreshadowing to prepare the reader for the next horror, but I shall not read any more books by Gillian Flynn.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Love the story line and the visual effects An incredible story of survival and it had a sort of happy ending
0060531053|5.0|I mostly liked two major issues. First, that a book is divided to three parts. Each part is intended for a different level of home brewer.<br />Second, that author each time convert an imperial units to the metric units. And third issue I liked is his psychological attitude.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|Too violent. Didn't really care for the plot and I would not recommend this movie and it should not be viewed by young  children.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book, original story, awesome love connection. I really loved this book - it is unique, that characters are well developed and it is not rushed. The author does a great job to reveal the story and keep you hungry. I read it in one night!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Her characters become clearer and clearer throughout the book as they become more interesting.  I realized that I had started to really care about both Jamie and Lydia about a third of the way through the book.  I am so glad that I continued to read after what felt like  a slow start.  I love Ireland and her visuals were excellent.  It was easy to picture the places and people with her clear descriptions.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This game can be a bit buggy but it totally makes up for it with fun. Once you get going you level up quickly. It's quite addictive!
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|Like many other reviewers, I am very disappointed in Disney's decision to not have a Deluxe-All-Formats version of this film.  I have just bought a 3D TV and have a small but growing 3D collection and even without having even seen the movie, I was planning to purchase.  However, without a 4-Disk version (3D Blu-ray, 2D Blu-ray, DVD and Digital) I intend not to purchase the film at all!  And btw, a \\"purchased-seperately\\" 2D blu-ray version doesn't meet my needs - it only makes me more angry!  Please join me and many others by voting with your dollars and boycott these blu-ray titles!
0307352153|5.0|I wish Quiet had been written years ago. I saw myself on every page.<br /><br />Not only did I see myself on every page, I saw that my introversion has always been an intrinsic part of me, even those years I believed I was an extrovert. INFJs are the most extroverted of the introverts, which was part of my confusion, but I also succumbed to what Cain describes as the Extrovert Ideal.<br /><br />Extroverts are prized in American society at every turn, from business on down to elementary school. Cain spends time delving into how extroversion has seeped into our churches, schools, economy, and work environments. She profiles well-known introverts (like Steve Wozniak and Rose Parks) and shows how their introversion helped them in their calling. She also interviews a bevy of experts and every day folks.<br /><br />The result is compelling. While the focus is on the power and talents all introverts hold, a good deal is geared toward extroversion and what works and what doesn't. Especially the pitfalls of extroversion, which have led us on precarious paths.<br /><br />For instance, introverts are more likely to be passed up for work promotions and not have their ideas credited or research funded. How many breakthroughs and advances have we missed out on as a result? If they express caution, such as the case of those who spoke up in the months and years before the bank crisis, they're either not heard or not taken seriously. In today's classroom and workplace, group work is expected and preferred, to the detriment of those who do their best work privately or 1:1. I would do horribly in either scenario! It shouldn't be a surprise that productivity often decreases in these scenarios.<br /><br />We have much to learn from one another and there's a danger when we go to an extreme with either temperament. It's best to let people work out of their strengths and complement each other.<br /><br />I could have kept reading for another 300 pages at least. It's a fascinating topic, whether examining personality research, delving into what shyness actually is, and detailing the hallmarks of Highly Sensitive People, who can be introverts or extroverts.<br /><br />I highly recommend it for everyone but particularly those in leadership positions and parents, especially if their personality style differs from your child. The same goes for those who are married to someone with a different personality style. Cain has a way of presenting the information so you can see yourself but also identify areas of improvement.<br /><br />I have no doubt I'll refer back to Quiet often in the years to come.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this book free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group as part of their Blogging for Books program. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255.ether examining personality research, delving into what shyness actually is, and detailing the hallmarks of Highly Sensitive People, who can be introverts or extroverts.<br /><br />I highly recommend it for everyone but particularly those in leadership positions and parents, especially if their personality style differs from your child.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are fun and they really keep you thinking and using your head.the only bad thing is how long it takes to earn points
0374533571|5.0|if you are able to view the movie and the book as separate entities, then definitely read this book! if you are looking for a book version of the movie then don't read this book. I saw the movie first and was surprised with how different they are - but it was a pleasant surprise. I loved the book. The characters are rich and feel very real. Pat is faced with some difficult situations and it's fascinating to see how he handles things - especially while trying to keep a positive outlook.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|love this game.. love the graphics and it has a very intrusting  story line... I would recommend it to anyone who loves hidden games like me. This game will keep you hook until the end. You actually act like a detective its a really awesome game to play!
B00CFQN12Q|4.0|Loved the movie. Typical Bruce Willis movie. Action packed, defiance, and just straight kick ass performance. Movie was a little short. Only 1 hr and 38 mins long. Oh well I guess they wanted to keep it short and to the point.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This game is a great game and very intrusting and great graphics... What I didn't like is that the game is not free and to get the whole game you have to pay 4.99 to me that's is a little to much for a hidden objects game now if it was 2.99 I would defiantly buy it. So if you would like to spend 4.99 go a head its a great game but not for that price...
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|Good story line and had action.  Will buy this for my collection.  I like this era in history and the costumes were very colorful.
B009TZBEKW|3.0|I love a few songs on the collaboration like Sweet Nothings, and a couple more, but after a while...it just goes too far and starts sounding the same, but that could be just me! Hmmmm, I wonder...

B00BESLHEA|4.0|I liked the action.  Story line was not good.  The actors used in this movie is what made the movie together with the action.

B000FBJFSC|5.0|This book is well known among school teachers. It shares a lesson in history. It puts a human face on a tough time for immigrant movements in this country and others.<br />DON&#34;T skip it because you might accidentally learn something. It's a good read, good story and worth your time.
1451695187|5.0|As a theologian I found the skepticism of the afterlife in the book good and necessary. After all, as Paul Tillich said, &#34;Doubt and faith are not antithetical to one another but necessary to one another.&#34; This book will appeal to those who can embrace paradox, ambiguity, mystery and yes, doubt. I &#34;devoured&#34; the book in 2 days.
B00479SVBU|1.0|This product was a amazing while it lasted... both times.<br /><br />When I first got the product I noticed that it was very difficult to put the auxiliary cable into the jacks. You had to use two hands and push hard. In addition the sound quality was very poor through the jack, basically a mono sound. I assumed this was standard as it was mainly for sd cards and USB (which sounded great and in stereo!). However, this morning I went to plug in my phone to play a song and when I removed it the sound quality never returned, it was crazy quiet as if the signal was outputting at a much weaker strength. Plus now I get mono sound wherever I go and however I play. While I am no audiophile I can't handle listening to anything with it now knowing how it used to sound. I feel like something at this price should be built to last a bit longer. I don't know if this is faulty or not but I will be returning this product. I do not recommend purchasing one. Back to the drawing board.<br /><br />Updated Review:<br />Soundfly replied to this review and through that conversation offered to send out a replacement for free. I am very grateful for the quick response and their desire to get out a good product... however.<br /><br />The replacement unit worked great! For a while. A few weeks in and the reverse of the first receiver happened. Any USB or SD songs would only play mono, not stereo. I was content with this imperfection as my only purpose was to plug in my phone via 3.5mm jack. 4 months later, however, the cable became very finicky. Constantly having to be 'tweeked' to play anything beyond mono. At 5 months it went completely mono despite any 'tweeking' of the cable and days later it stopped transmitting anything but static. Seems like two different issues going on with this one as well.<br /><br />It is clearly a simple case of cheap parts. Knowing enough about audio it is clear currents are being interrupted and power is not getting where it needs to be to function correctly. I would happily have a unit double the size of this one that was actually made to last.<br /><br />I am disappointed that this product was made so poorly. It is an EXCELLENT product when it works! But it was made with cheap parts.<br /><br />Both are in the mail to be returned.<br /><br />I am going to try their previous product to see if the build quality is better - it is currently about $10 cheaper and offers the single function I need, the 3.5 MM jack. I am going to hope that the build quality is better on their previous product. it can be found here: [[ASIN:B0018P7WZ2 Soundfly Player Transmitter Stick Players]]<br /><br />Second Update:<br />after getting the older model in the mail and having it only put out mono and static for sound, I promptly returned the product. I am sad that this product did not work out. Most other transmitters are awful and putting out good sound. This was a amazing at putting out good sound, when it worked.<br /><br />NOT recommended.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I've been playing Minecraft since alpha on the PC but was reluctant to get the pocket version.  Amazon put it on sale and I decided to go for.  Since then it has been the only game I've played.  If you haven't played Minecraft it's probably not going to make sense or sound like fun but Imagine a world made of Lego where you can do and build anything you imagine.  Pocket edition is definitely a dumbed down version as it doesn't even include buckets yet, crafting is all click to create as opposed to having recipes.  Though honestly having to memorize what pattern to put what materials in was by far the most annoying thing about the PC version of Minecraft IMHO.  I play on a tablet and honestly don't think I'd enjoy it half as much on my phone so perhaps keep that in mind.

193700788X|1.0|** SPOILER ALERT! **<br /><br />When the other books in the series were released, I burned through them like a spark through a tinderbox, even though the last two or three weren't all that spectacular. I made it through DEA in one day only because I was sick in bed and couldn't go to work.<br /><br />DEA was so awful, in my opinion, that I actually took breaks to watch a little Food Network on TV, play Candy Crush Saga, nap, and lurk on Facebook.<br /><br />Yeah, it's that bad.<br /><br />I have to agree with a friend of mine who is convinced this was done by a ghost writer. The feel of the whole story is off...way off. And NEVER has CH used third person point of view in any of the SVM books. It was used frequently in this one. It's almost like she didn't want to bother with having to figure out how to relate what the extraneous characters were up to while telling the story in Sookie's POV.<br /><br />It's a common sentiment that most of the characters have totally gone lame during the last few books, but this time they're just flat-out strange. After being publicly divorced by Eric, Sookie appears to pretty much just shrug it off like she hasn't spent the last nine books agonizing over, fighting with, fighting against, and rolling in the hay with him.<br /><br />Amelia comes back and Sookie forgives her Alcide transgression. Alcide himself comes back and is forgiven his (grossly stupidly written) bedroom incident. Hell, Sookie is even tickled pink to see John Quinn when he comes strolling in after she selfishly kicked him the curb.<br /><br />And we all know Sookie always forgives Bill. This go-round she even momentarily considers rebound sex with him after Eric divorces her. Really, Charlaine? Bill lovers the world over were probably holding their collective breaths over this juicy tidbit while the rest of us were throwing up in our mouths a little.<br /><br />In addition to the completely out-of-character characters, much of the continuity of this book makes little to no sense. For five books, Sookie obsessed over whether or not the fact her blood bond with Eric was guiding her feelings of affection and/or love for him. She even went so far as to go behind his back and break the bond to find out if what she felt was truly love. (Turns out, it was.) Yet she doesn't bat an eye over the fact that her use of the cluviel dor on Sam could influence her feelings toward him.<br /><br />Also, Sookie's ability to read Sam's thoughts throughout the series has always been made plain. Now, all of a sudden, the most she can get is feelings of emotions? What a convenient turn of events for a writer who is trying to justify sticking her telepathic heroine with someone whose thoughts she will have to shield for life or longer...a heroine who was drawn to vampires in the first place because of their silent brains.<br /><br />And honestly, the whole premise of Copley Carmichael's plot to steal the cluviel dor from Sookie so he can use it to control Amelia's life? At least that's what I understood the gist to be. Then again, by the time it got to that point in the book my brain was so fried I could be way off base. All I know is I sure don't want to read it again for clarification. So if anyone wants to help me out on this one, be my guest.<br /><br />The parade of long-gone characters--Copley Carmichael, Steve Newlin, John Quinn, Johan Glassport, Arlene Fowler--in my opinion read like a thrown-together This Is Your Life, Sookie Stackhouse. Throw in one pissed off Claude Crane, and lumping these characters together for plot makes about as much sense as a monkey, a donkey, and a chicken on the same bowling team.<br /><br />What upsets me the most is the complete annihilation of the Eric character. I admit I've been an Eric fan since somewhere around LDiD, so I'll try not to be biased here. But since DUD he has been written as powerful, mysterious, brooding, and beautiful. He always went out of his way to make sure Sookie was protected, and he never failed to show his affection for her, however subtle it may have been at times.<br /><br />Eric ends the series, however, as pouting, spiteful, and spineless, whining over the fact that Sookie used the cluviel dor to save Sam's life instead of using it to get him out of his arranged marriage to the queen of Oklahoma. The Eric from books prior would have had the cunning and wherewithal to come up with his own plan to free himself from the yoke of his maker's arrangement with Oklahoma. Instead, the ghost of the Viking vampire we came to love ends up as Felipe de Castro's whipping boy, sold into what is tantamount to sexual slavery for not the customary 100 year royal marriage, but a 200 year sentence.<br /><br />The author's dislike and disdain for the Eric character couldn't be more evident if she'd titled this book Why I Hate Eric Northman. One last big Eff-You to the Eric lovers of the world. What she failed to realize was it was mostly us Eric lovers who have lined her pockets and padded her coffers with money from all the books we bought from her over the years.<br /><br />I canceled my pre-order for the limited edition, linen-bound, autographed copy of DEA, as well as After Dead. Not spending $100 on a sham. I could buy Sookie choosing Sam (always said she would end up with him) had we not had 9 -- I repeat -- NINE books of a relationship with Eric with no mention of romantic inclinations toward Sam, always just a close friend. She was also paired with several characters during the course of the series; ending up with Bill, Alcide, or Quinn would have been a surprise, but at least we could have considered it plausible, yanno?<br /><br />I agree, this book series went into the toilet once True Blood came onto the scene. It's like once Alan Ball totally massacred the characters, Ms. Harris decided she would, too. She has repeatedly said they are her characters to do with as she sees fit, and I totally agree. But wouldn't it make more sense, at least from a financial standpoint, to write something you know your readers will buy? It's pretty high handed on her part to think that just because we bought all the other books that we would be beholden to buy this farewell F-you to her readers.<br /><br />I don't feel like I've been gypped out of a Sookie/Eric HEA; she doesn't deserve him. I just feel like I've been screwed out of an ending that makes sense.<br /><br />Did I want Sookie and Eric to end up together at the end of the series? Initially, yes. Even though Sookie has made it plain from Day One that she has no wish to become a vampire, I always hoped that they would discover some way--fae magic from Naill, perhaps--to stay together for centuries, at least. But with the deterioration of the characters for the last few books, it doesn't make sense for them to end up together. That being said, it also doesn't make sense that she would choose Sam, a best friend/boss character for whom there has been no romantic interest, no build-up WHATSOEVER to being Sookie's HEA. If Sookie didn't end up with Eric, it would have made more sense for her to end up with Alcide, or even *chokes* Bill.<br /><br />The decline in reader ratings on both Goodreads and Amazon.com for each successive book since From Dead to Worse is testament to the fact the author has lost her passion for and interest in these characters. Maybe this series was stretched out just a little too long. Slapping words together for a paycheck is not the hallmark of a great author, even if you do have a few New York Times bestsellers under your belt.ever failed to show his affection for her, however subtle it may have been at times.<br /><br />Eric ends the series, however, as pouting, spiteful, and spineless, whining over the fact that Sookie used the cluviel dor to save Sam's life instead of using it to get him out of his arranged marriage to the queen of Oklahoma.

B00006RCNJ|1.0|It was not described properly. I could NOT play it on my DVD player as it was not suited for playing like all the others that I have bought through Amazon.I was not told before hand that it required a special type of DVD player.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Spoilers......First off I prolly shouldn't of even read this book. I'm ok with her ending up with Sam kinda knew it would happen, but really your going to write Eric out of sookies  life like that? You spend 12 books building that character up and giving the character such a big roll in the sookie stackhouse novels to make him do something that we all know the character wouldn't allow to happen cause I mean come on its eric no one controls eric. And the ending with Claude, really? It was such a great series to have the last book just destroy it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I think this is my favorite game.  Some days it is a little frustrating,but always a great time. You have lots of options to earn credits so can play a long while. Free tournament every day you can win powerups and credits as well.  Overall a fun game!

B003CI90MQ|5.0|I am by no means a beginner in photography. With a BA in photography and a Masters in Photojournalism from New York Universiy I am fully aware of most of the techniques for making photographs. Having said that I am new to digital photography. My experience is film which I still shoot on occasion. Therefore I read every worthwhile book pertaining to digital photography. Not knowing Scott Kelby I purchased his book (in kindle)  and from page one he reminded me of one of my instructors at NYU. Scott Kelby makes learning simple, easy to understand and most of all.....FUN. When something you want or need to learn is FUN, you will remember it forever. I also, to complete the set purchased all four of the series and several of Scott's recommendations for additional information in digital photography. If you don't learn from this book how to make better photographs....take up knitting.
1594203334|5.0|Loved this recounting of observing children, of the reasoning behind the strategy to educate the children in autonomy, respect for others and a freedom to explore and enjoy the world.  Including eating the same meals, and at a table.  Nice to have guidelines to feel safe, but allowed lots of freedom, too.

B00COHAUD4|4.0|this movie was good there is no doubt about that it was not a typical plot in the sense of how the movie goes even though the theme of an evil spirit is something very familiar. the acting was good and it truly can't do on the edge of your seat. I'm the kind of person who will cringe turn my head and peeks through the splits off my fingers when I know the scary part about to happen in this movie had plenty of them. If you like to be startled then I recommend this movie did you enjoy horror movies then I recommend this movie if you like any kind of good thriller and suspense then I recommend this movie.

B00BB22GQM|5.0|After a three year hiatus, Ivy-League indie-rockers Vampire Weekend return with their third studio album, the highly anticipated [[ASIN:B00BB22GQM Modern Vampires of the City]].  So many times, the hype that surrounds a new release is far overblown,  with the effort failing to meet loft expectations.  For Modern Vampires of the City, this is NOT an issue.  Vampire Weekend show maturity and growth on this eclectic, restless affair.  With no misses and twelve consecutive solid tracks, Modern Vampires of the City is easily one of 2013's very best albums.<br /><br />\\"Obvious Bicycle\\" is simply beautiful; arguably one of Vampire Weekend's loveliest songs to date.  Frontman Ezra Koenig sounds effortless here, particularly when he hits his signature, gorgeous falsetto on the chorus (\\"So listen oh / so listen oh / Don't wait / Don't wait\\").  The sharp, rebellious \\"Unbelievers\\" contrasts the more restrained opener, with Koenig singing memorably \\"We know the fire awaits unbelievers / all of the sinners the same / girl you and I will die unbelievers / bound to the tracks of the train.\\" \\"Unbelievers\\" truly cements the religious vs. nonreligious theme that graces Modern Vampires of the City.<br /><br />On \\"Step\\", harpsichord adds to the dreamy nature of the production work.  Koenig's vocal approach is light, matching the ornamental nature of the harpsichord's obbligato.  The wordplay of the uptempo \\"Diane Young\\" is humorous and clever: \\"If Diane Young [dying young] won't change your mind... \\".  The best line is pop-cultural/historically charged: \\"Irish and proud, baby, naturally / but you got the luck of a Kennedy\\". Autotune rears its head here, but actually enhances given its clever usage to create interesting vocal effects; he doesn't go all 'T-Pain' extreme.  On \\"Don't Lie\\", organ adds an extra soulful nature to the cut.  Later, strings further enhance the timbre. In addition to an enjoyable palette of sounds, the songwriting continues to stand out: \\"I want to know does it bother you? The low click of a ticking clock / there's a lifetime right in front of you/ and everyone I know\\".<br /><br />On \\"Hannah Hunt\\", the singer/songwriting side of Vampire Weekend shines, as much of the cut is reserved with no chorus. At the end, things grow in scope, particularly when Koenig reiterates a newly established chorus up an octave (\\"If I can't trust you then damn it, Hannah / There's no future, there's no answer...\\".  On \\"Everlasting Arms\\", the religious references return overtly, with the band playing up multiple interpretations of the lyrics: \\"Hold me up in your everlasting arms / looked up, full of fear, trapped beneath the chandelier that's going down\\".  On \\"Finger Back\\", the Columbia alums have a bit more fun, rivaling some of their uptempo, ridiculously addictive cuts from their debut, [[ASIN:B0010V4TZU Vampire Weekend]].  References to religious skepticism return full throttle on two more consecutive standouts in \\"Worship You\\" (\\"...in foreign soil, in foreign land / who will guide us to the end?\\") and \\"Ya Hey\\", which is a play on 'Yahweh' (God).  Both seem atheistic in tone (which might offend some), but are brilliantly written and produced nonetheless.  Art can always be polarizing.<br /><br />\\"Hudson\\" shows some unification to \\"Don't Lie\\" lyrically, once more referencing 'time' (\\"...Over and over again like a prize changing hands / the time has come / the clock is such a drag...\\".  The use of organ and a choral pad insinuates liturgical music/timbre, which is quite clever.  \\"Young Lion\\" closes in lullaby fashion, featuring on a  few short lyrics: \\"You take your time, young lion...\\"  Overall, [[ASIN:B00BB22GQM Modern Vampires of the City]] is superb.  Creative, clever, and 'against the grain', it is a juggernaut by all means.  Incorporating a little bit of everything, Vampire Weekend once again impress. 4 ½ Stars.ther you?

B004XC5LP0|5.0|Not much to say. This is a favorite disaster movie. It was a joy to acquire it. If you like this type of movie, it's worth adding to your collection.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Loads of fun, but cannot transfer progress from one device to another.  Really disappointed to have lost all my progress just because I upgraded my device.
B001OQCV2O|5.0|There are very few movies that involve the total destruction of Earth (or our way of life) and this is one of the more entertaining. A must add if you enjoy this genre.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|It took me a little while to get into it, but the truly Irish twist to it all was great. At first the continuing shifts from the orphanage to the present was confusing, but as I followed the story through, I realised it could be written no other way. Really well-written and conceived.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|I just really wanted to give this book five stars. I thought it was exceptional. Everyone should have a chance to learn from it.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|Very fun card game.  Great graphics and enough variety to keep your interest.  My first multiplayer game i was matched up with a player that had double my health and almosr twice as many cards in their deck (if you run out of cards you basically battle it out with whats left.)  And the campaign gets real hard real fast.  Would encourage you to download and try yourself.
B004GJXQ20|4.0|Enjoyed the book - struggled to put it down - sometimes hard to follow with too much happening. Overall well worth the read - haven't seen the series yet either.
0811879542|5.0|My 3 year old daughter loves to have us read this book to her!  We read it daily and she has it memorized.  I like that it is interactive and she likes following the instructions on each page.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This is a great game I really like it although I'm having problems with it staying open which ducks. Has anyone else been having issues with this game?
B00000K2UX|5.0|This is one of my favorite movie soundtracks from the '80's.  Even better, it came with the digital version as well so it was easy to load onto my android phone and Kindle Fire!
B006M4F67A|5.0|I like the koi images in the background.  The formations are fun as well. the average completion is 2.5 to 7 minutes so not bad.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Definitely one of the best shows with enough gore to make you satisfied. Great story line, true realistic rivalries, altogether great show!
B005MLOOJA|5.0|The acting is great. The plot is continuously new and interesting. There is enough back plot to keep you going alone, but the individual episodes are also intriguing.
0140544518|5.0|My 6-year old newphew and 8-year old niece loved it. Considering buying a copy to keep for myself. Great spin on an old story.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I love knowing what she is thinking!! and how it effects her life and its just such an amazing book :)
B003VANOFY|1.0|The headset will start making a loud buzzing noise and stop playing other sound, then shut off for 15 minutes then reset.
B0095P31L6|5.0|This was a great cartoon. Johnny Dep is always good and he was excellent and did not disappoint in this one. It is nice to be able to just get lost in cartoons as adults still. Highly recommend for just a relaxing afternoon viewing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game for kids and some adults. Easy to learn and buy stuff in game without real money. Must have game for horse enthusiast.
0316098337|1.0|I bought this book as a member of a book club, that I have since left.  The story deals with a kidnapped woman held in a single room for years.  It tells of her abuse, rape, miscarriages and birth of a son that she raises by herself while being held in this room.  It is an interesting story that I found to disturbing to recommend. A book I found more \\"tolerable\\" is \\"Still Missing\\".  It is about an young woman taken hostage from an \\"open house\\" she was holding.  She was held in a mountain cabin for over a year.
B008220C38|1.0|I purchased this for my daughter for Mother's Day...she had seen it on pay per view and hated it so I'm returning an unopened dvd for credit...not your fault.  Daughter said much to hard to understand  Sorry, this happens rarely with Amazon.<br />Always satisfied
B0090P98Z4|4.0|This game is a nice filler for dungeon crawlers but still has a casual feel floors are too short and the path to the end of the floor is too linear
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Nice graphics. Cannot go wrong with iron man. I like the different upgrades in armor and suits. Coloring on the suits are very good as well.
B00124BNF4|5.0|I don't love all of the Talking Heads music (sorry), but I do like a lot of it and for the price, this is a great collection.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|We really enjoyed the movie. I did not read the books, but I believe I understood the gist of the story. The movie surprised me in it's length, but that did not bother me overall. It was an interesting and sad story when you think of it, but the movie was well done and I thought well acted.
B008KE3960|2.0|downloaded this game And let me Tell u, its much harder than it appears lol! The damn planes need more fire power & they are too slow!!!!
B00B49L7JY|5.0|I watched this on the advice of my youngest son, who saw it at the movies. I am glad I got to see it and would recommend it to anyone. What an uplifting and amazing story. It must have been quite an experience for him and his family, as well as for those who searched for him. Just a cool story.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Just as good as the first season! Such a powerful look into the English culture in the 1900s. I appreciate that we get to see into not only the lives of those more fortunate, but also the lives of the servants. It shows just how intertwined life can be between class-systems,  especially when big life events occur.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like finding things in the lightened rooms instead of the darkened ones.  The interaction with the different characters is a fun twist to the regular search and find games.
B004YM6JP0|5.0|This series is a nice change to all the stupid stuff on tv.  I will continue to purchase all seasons.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|What can I say? I am not usually a fan of historic novel but the reading of this book was superb, and I can find no other way to express myself!<br />Described emotions were sharp, and the action was tense and riveting. The writing style is simple, but I think is the best way of narrating such an eventful period of our history.<br />The different historical, geographical and psychological perspectives that the author manages so well are probably the best feature of this novel, that I highly recommend.
B002JVWRAE|5.0|So happy to find this.  Now I can watch whenever I want to.  I am totally hooked on this series.
B0060AY85C|5.0|GOOD LORD THIS BOOK WAS TOUCHING ABOUT A BROTHER AND SISTERS UNCONDITIONAL LOVE FOR EACH OTHER DURING THEIR TIMES OF TURMOIL..
B008476HBM|5.0|I have dozens of books on my  Kindle, but I like to have the classics to.  This story is one of my favorites.  I always look for them in the free downloads.  The quality is good and I am never disappointed.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Jeremy Renner is hilarious and as always Tom Cruise give good form. I've watched Top Gun several times and I must say, he has aged well compared to Val Kilmer.
B006M4F67A|4.0|Its a free kindle app.  Of all of them, I like this one the most.  Not much flexibility, though.  ok
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have misplaced my  Kindle, so I decided to get a tablet and download the Kindle app to it.  It was very easy to do and to transfer the books that I had already purchased.
B006M4F67A|4.0|love this game, only problem I have is the big puzzles are hard to see... not sure how this could be fixed just saying...
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|My 10 year old enjoyed this book. He says it got straight to the point and didn't<br /> disappoint him. He's very picky :/
1451678193|5.0|This book is absolutely one of the best books I have ever read.  The imagination required to write this book is astounding.  It is like a playground for your imagination, the kind of book where you stop reading for minutes at a time just to imagine something original that was triggered by the words on the page.
0385349947|4.0|I think some of the reviewers are missing the point here. Sandberg may have been born into privilege and she might not be symbolic of a typical middle-class woman, but that does not mean she did not have to face the stresses of being in a male-dominated business environment. The men who she encountered did not automatically treat her very differently just because she went to Harvard and worked with Larry Summers. Benevolent and casual sexism was still part of her world. My advice is to consider those parts of the book which talk about common hurdles faced by women from all backgrounds and ignore the rest. After all, you don't need to relate to every single statement in a book to appreciate it.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|i like it because every morning i get up and look at my kindle to see the weather! its fun to look at the weather ahead of time.
B000ICKPOQ|4.0|I like the characters, their interaction (not as tight as SG-U, but pretty good). The idea of Atlantis is always romantic, and this is a SG-consistent explanation of what happened to the &#34;island.&#34;
B004N4IHU4|5.0|If you like warm sounding thick guitars played thru fat tubes then get this album. I think its a compliment to be compared to old Black Sabbath. I'm picky its good to find some new music to stick in the rotation. A job well done ! P.S. F critics !
B000I9U8VO|5.0|I loved the movie as all the X-men saga. The image and sound where really good. Renting movies through Amazon makes it so much easier.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|All around good read.  Suspenceful and entertaining.  I would be happy to recommend this book to friends and strangers alike.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely love love LOVE this game. you get to explore different part of the world on a hovercraft its awesome. I regimend this game to people who like temple run or survival run.... get you will like it.. I would even pay for this game that's how good it is...
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I'm fairly new to all this and just recently joined a gym. I got a free personal trainer session and felt it was not very productive, and almost laughed when the guy offered me more sessions at £30 each per hour.<br /><br />I wanted to increase my knowledge and have a plan of action for going to the gym, and always felt that men's health magazines were full of contradictory information and complete BS.<br /><br />Having read the other reviews of this book, I thought I'd give it a go. I read the whole book in about two days (couldn't set it down!) and found it thoroughly useful.<br /><br />It included relevant scientific explanations about diet and exercise which help you understand the why and the how. It included diet plans for bulking, cutting and maintaining and workout plans for all three, and much more.<br /><br />What I really like about this book is that Mike's personality comes across loads - he seems like a really intelligent, level-headed guy who not only wants to look good, but to feel good as well. I'm making a shopping list to completely re-work my diet (apart from the odd cheat meal which is okay!) and hit the gym with a renewed energy and zeal next week.<br /><br />I'm sure I won't be disappointed by the results if I stick to Mike's advice.<br /><br />I'd strongly recommend this anyone who wants to know more about not only working out, but for general healthy-eating advice as well. Top stuff!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the best games on a mobile device! Way better than temple run that's for sure! I think they should put a little bit more effort into the actual game itself and its updates
B00992CF6W|2.0|so I loved this game  but I had 50 worlds and my kindle fire died and then all of my worlds where gone.And this is not a kindle problem.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|Not everyone likes how sexual these books are, even say they are demoralising. I think its always in a consenting relationship so enjoy how Ana and Christian work through their different ideas to come up with a workable relationship for them. Was addicted!
B005DZMQ5Y|5.0|listenning to it is loving it. If you liked Dark Clouds And Silver Linings, you will like this one. Epic sounds for your ears!
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Not everyone likes how sexual these books are, even say they are demoralising. I think its always in a consenting relationship in these books so enjoy how Ana and Christian work through their different ideas to come up with a workable relationship for them. Could give a few kiwi blokes some tips on how to look after their woman with the whole care package - I don't just mean in bed!
B0036TGSIK|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas present for my aunt and she has had no problems with it. A little worn on the case but the disc works great and doesn't skip!
B009NY43NY|4.0|This book really does fall in line with the others, yet it doesn't end as if it were the final book.  Too many possibilities that can still be explored.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have always enjoyed playing card games and enjoy the competitiveness of this game.  You can use 1-4 sets depending on how difficult you want to make it.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Keep up the good work! The game is very easy to get cash and interest points unlike other games were you need to pay!
B005H29GSI|4.0|The blocks are ok to build with but a little slippery. I really like the birds that come with this toy.  I like it as much as the original angry birds.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Until now I have never published and Ebook on Amazon. This book gave some very nice information for me the beginner. It didn't take long to find out that writing the book was the easiest part of writing a book. The harder part was following all the formating rules and pit holes along the way. This book helped me get through some of the tough stages. The technology era changes daily and it is clear that you have to do this everyday to keep up with current events. This book helped me with that.
B000A6T1JU|5.0|My husband always quoted lines from this movie to our kids, and of course they never got it until one day they asked what he was talking about so I found it here and bought. Now our kids and my husband go back and forth, and surprisingly my kids liked the movie. I liked that it arrived sooner than expected and was packaged good. Thanks for the flash back...
B00B6QXN56|5.0|So much talent on this double CD. I love the guitar, the piano, the violins and drums. Joe Bonamassa is one of the best entertainers alive today. If you like guitar music, you MUST have this.
B00AEFY5TI|5.0|I had been wanting to see this movie but only had it on VHS, yes I know I hear it all the time from my kids, I finally discovered it here and bought it on DVD, welcome to modern technology, I watched this when I was young and loved it then and more today. It arrived sooner than I expected and was packaged extremely well.
1449437524|5.0|Hilarious! I must order more to give to my friends who have a dog. This captures their doggie personality in a humorous way with darling illustrations. I can't stop laughing!!!
B00AAQWMB4|5.0|I love this game!  I have the board game so I was already familiar with it and this is a fantastic android version.
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|Didn't get past the &#34;teaching&#34; part of the game it's weird.  I didn't get the object.  It must be for small children ???
0399226907|5.0|Little man is too small yet to really let me know how he feels, but I love this book. He does seem very attracted to the illustrations in the book and is constantly pawing at them while we read. The book will hold a 4 month old's attention.
0679805273|5.0|It is a fun book and very uplifting for children... I would recommend to for children above the age of 7 or 8 just because the moral is more about growing up and exploring the world.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Great app!!!! It provides a ton of information, helps me to effectively manage my Kindle and ALWAYS works. Thanks for a great app!
B006M4F67A|3.0|Would like some other character choices  The Chinese characters are not as familiar and are difficult for younger users... Bye
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|The game would keep freezing requiring hard shut down on my kindle fire.  I finally had to delete.  Fix the problem and I might consider downloading again.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I liked the way it moved from the first book into this one continuing the saga smoothly. It is very well written and easy to follow. 55
B00701L5XS|5.0|This application provides the how, when, where, and why information for most knots in a straightforward easy to understand manner.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I chose this book because I really enjoyed the 1st two books and am looking for the conclusion to the story.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|One day I am drawing and loving my app and then poof!  Frozen. I tried removing. deleting. reinstalling. over and over ... and nothing. Oh well :(
B000FC1PNE|5.0|Loved it from the beginning!  You have to love Penelope and Colin.  As both their insecurities are revealed and they find strength in each other you have to keep reading to see what is next!  Anyone who love the Bridgerton's will really love this!!!
B006M4F67A|3.0|Still trying to find the rules of the game!!!  I like playing Mahjong games and this one may ultimately be my favorite.
B0083EY9EI|4.0|This is a great album. I love the song &#34;My Kind of Love&#34; the best! Awesome job by Emeli Sande!!!
B005UL53AQ|5.0|If You're Looking For A Modern Take On Sherlock Holmes This Is The One For You. Even If You're a Life-Long Fan Of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Work, This Will Not Disappoint. The Stories Are wonderfully Crafted By The Brilliant Steven Moffat (You May Know Him From His Work On Doctor Who) And Will Keep You Guessing And Shocked Until The End...And Then Some. This Show Also Uses Brilliant, Innovative Devices For Maximum Visual Pleasure. For Example, When Someone Recieves A Text Message, instead Of Cutting To A Shot Of their Mobile, It Will Show The Text Onscreen, Allowing The Viewer To Read It, And Watch The Reaction Of The Characters. Just Watch It.
0061537934|5.0|Reading this book has given me such a different perspective of a dog's life. I can almost hear what my dogs are telling me now. I love this book. A definite read for dog lovers. I'm almost done reading it.
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|I never heard of this series until a friend recommended it to me.  No I am hooked real good.  I only have the first to season.  Hope they are doing more.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Best book I've read in years.Sad to see the series is finally over.Mr Sanderson was the right choice to finish this series.I will definitely be checking out the rest of his work.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I choose this rating because the series just gets better and better with each season.  I pick this TV program on Thursdays even though I like NCIS, I have to watch my Vampire Diaries.
B002SRQ214|5.0|yes, it uses AM3 socket. But using an old socket doesn't mean it's bad or slow. It's a great CPU for  everything (gaming, programming, word processing, etc.)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I bought this book because I read \\"The Hunger Games\\" and \\"Catching Fire.\\" I completely recommend this book to everyone that is a fan of The Hunger Games Series.<br /><br />And as always, \\"May the odds be ever in your favor.\\"
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Great game.<br />I really enjoyed playing this game.  It was challenging without being too difficult. The graphics were good. I would recommend. this game.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I bought these specifically for when i run.  Love them!  They dont fall off and i dont have to keep adjusting them every 2 seconds like with the i-phone ear buds
B006M4F67A|1.0|I have not been able to complete a game Thunderbolt freezes up. Still working on figuring out what is wrong. graphics are great, game looks good, but freezes up.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|It´s is very well organize and you can see just the updates and documentations that were upload to the application
0316044695|4.0|I really like real war stories. I haven't been able to read it yet, but I'm sure, since it isn't fiction it'llb e good.
B007FTZDN8|4.0|You can see the Preentation in full screen mode and is a good way to sort and choose any presentation.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|Love it. I love that is is so stylish but is ver functional. Easy to use and protects my kindle so good.
B005HED08I|5.0|What not to love about The Original Star Trek, I really like the remastered ones, I happen to catch one on the local channel and went and looked for it here on Amazon.  What I like about it is that they kept the same feel of the show (Like remember when they are on a planet and the background is all one color and seems to stop right at the dried bushes or rocks.  Well that is the same) but when you see the Enterprise it is crisp, clear, looks nice and the planets when they are orbiting look good with land masses and other things.  (In the original because of tech back then it was a green planet or an orange planet,)  You should watch a few of these I am sure you would like them.
B00A4VGUIG|1.0|Just started this game.. all the reviews are positive but I can't get passed the part where you get fish from eddy. He won't take the bucket.. how do I get past this part?
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book has a great ending but it is a little boring in the beginning and it's to technical but u should read it if you read catching fire and the hunger games
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|This game isn't nearly as good as the original gangstar. Kind of trash to be honest.<br />(Control wise, graphics, dialogue audio, etc.)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|with this app it makes it real easy to stay in the word no matter were i am I can increase my knowledge of god's word.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This s another great craft by Rick Riordan. This takes on a crazy adventure between two groups o demigods. So much great action and adventure.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|The acting and directing are as sterling as in Season One and the writing hasn't flagged as often happens when the writers have &#34;shot their wad&#34; with the excitement of a hit series.  It's as captivating as ever...the only caveat I would offer is that the decision to treat this series more like individual tales that are not revisited is sometimes unsettling.  The viewer is left without knowing what will happen to the great love story of the boy who confesses to a murder his girlfriend committed, etc.  They may revisit it, but it's not likely because each week, it's a new entanglement for the main characters that takes center stage and they have left many tales in the lurch, so it doesn't bother them as much as it bothers me...just a hopeless romantic.  Anyway, I'm still hacking away at as many episodes as I can watch and digest before the new season starts up...I'm still as hooked as I was with Season One.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|I can't understand how this movie was made.  It is really good, Shot really well.  Really a good story,  Rent it, it is worth your time to see it.
B006M4F67A|2.0|I am still trying to figure out how to get it to my Kindle. then i will love it lol
0060930349|5.0|At the height of his powers (1972-1997), Mr Johnson produced several works that could only be called magisterial. This is one of them. Lengthy, dense, rich in detail, and yet emininently readable, real page-turners. What I loved about Johnson was that on every page I could exclaim about some fact &#34;I didn't know that!&#34;, no matter how familiar I was with the basics of the subject matter, or &#34;I never thought about looking it in that way&#34;. Moreover, I never felt that Johnson was forcing his opinions on me: he was inviting me to engage with him.<br /><br />This book was first published in 1997, when he was 69, and is the last of his great works. His writings since then have been slight, and mostly rather sad ad hominem attacks. If you want to read Johnson, start with this one, and then work backward through his ouevre.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I was very sick last weekend and purchased this download for my 6 year old. Although I don't like him playing video games all day, it was cold and rainy and he let me rest. It entertained him and he would lay in bed with me showing me the cool stuff on the game.
B009JCPM5S|2.0|You know, they always used to joke about creepy children, calling them \\"Children Of the Corn.\\"  I believe I now understand that it refers to children forced to watch a really crappy rendition of another Stephen King novel, which deserved more than a shoestring budget to produce.
B005HEFB6M|4.0|If you are a fan of the Star Trek Universe this series is good fun. Some of it is difficult to mesh with the settings and environment in other the later series and movies.However, the prequel series does well standing on its own.
B000RNFKEQ|5.0|this vinyl is allll right! it does not skip not even if u nudge the needle!!!!!! thats the type of control that i like, i even use it in virtual dj and have no issues!!! thats a real first, i recommend this product to anyone who has a dvs system with virtual dj, mixvibes, pcdj or deckadance to use this....u will not be disappointed!
B005ZB91KY|5.0|We watched this with the whole family and we all just loved it. Very well done and a real treat -<br /><br />With a good monitor and speakers this movie keeps your attention and is a very enjoyable movie - would highly recommend this for any family to watch.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This Game Is Awesome Because You Get To Build, Craft, ETC. Its Amazing. I Love It. When Is 0.7.0 Comin' Out, BTW ?
1423140605|5.0|I have read all that has been released in this series and love them all. Hate the cliffhangers but Great read ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
B003TTKB5I|4.0|Grey's Anatomy is a mix of medical drama with romantic drama, which sucks you in to caring about the characters.  Start from the beginning if pure going to start watching the show.
B009R659L8|1.0|All of Mary Higgins Clark's books that I have read (and that has been most of them) are so much alike that I cannot remember one book from the other.  I guess I keep hoping that maybe one will finally be just a little bit different from the wealthy New Yorker heroes and heroines that are the protagonists of all her books.  It would also be nice to have some actual character development, rather than just adding on characters throughout the book, so the reader will get more confused as to who is good and who might be the villain. The book I enjoyed the most by Mary Higgins Clark was Mount Vernon Love Story (underline understood),as it had some historical significance and wasn't the same old drivel.  I have probably read my last of this author's books.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I would never have red this book had I understood exactly what it was about before I started ... creepy and scary ... well-written and suspenseful ...
B0041D843M|5.0|If you like the science behind the meal, if you want to know how we are being influenced to eat incorrectly, this is the study
B003G8Y4QO|4.0|I grew weary of not understanding the lingo my grown children and others frequently use gleaned from Dr Who. So, with trepidation, captions, and my kids as interpreters I began the journey from season one on. With each season after getting over the sensation my head might explode, I got the hang of some of it and even began looking forward to an occasional evenings full of \\"rubbish\\" and Daleks! Each season seems to get better or... perhaps I just understand it better!<br /> We even caused a waiter to scurry back to our table  when he overheard us reference a  favorite alien race of mine.... (Banakaufalata!) ,or maybe it was \\"weeping angels\\" he couldn't resist.  ;) Honestly if pressed to review only season 5 I'd have to admit to not being able to isolate which episode goes where (yet) I can only say each season has been better than the preceding one. Well onto season 6 now...almost caught up! Yay!
B001YB29HG|5.0|To begin with... Nathan Fillion. And adorable Felicia Day. Plus Steve the Extra. Always wait for the credits to finish rolling.
B003HFFVDQ|4.0|Excellent tunes by the Chemical Brothers, I like how it blends all together from one song to another. Not as good as thier best in my opinion, Exit Planet Dust, but pretty close. :-)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So many twists & turns, I'm always wondering what is going to happen next.  The acting is great & very believable and it also gives me a great sense for the history taking place at that time.  I am disappointed by some of the happenings, but that goes with real life as well.  Very anxious to see what happens in season 4.
B001CDWFPC|1.0|I this study bible, I use it and love it.  I was excited when I saw the KINDLE version.  Did not work on either of my tablets.
B00COMLLX2|1.0|Do not like it at all I was looking for a star wars pinball for free and I get this one not don't like it
B0092MKTL2|5.0|Great album! My son is one month old and I leave this album on repeat and it always makes him fall asleep. Thanks.

030746363X|5.0|I have been following the &#34;diet&#34; which is no diet for almost six moths and I have lost weight and gained energy and self-esteem.<br />This is a lifetime routine. Thanks, Mr Ferriss, for the chapter about good sex. It was needed forty years ago and possible now.<br />It is never too late to learn.
1616550414|5.0|This was a gift for a dear friend and Mega Zelda fan. He loves it. Says it is just the perfect book
0547884591|5.0|At first I thought he , Ferriss, was over the top or crazy, but after reading  the book twice I changed my mind. It is good.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Love her book. Did not see the end coming. I thought I had it figured out, but low and behold I didn't.
B007T99ENE|4.0|A good read.  I like the way Ian McEwan writes. He slowly draws you in to his story and you want to keep reading.
1579128955|5.0|Beautiful book with fantastic photos. My 11 year old son loves it, and it's a great add to your personal library.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Trilogy is  a must read. Great descriptions & had my imagination wondering.  Can not wait for the next installment of Fifty!!!!
B0091REZMW|3.0|This game is enjoyable, it a good object search game. The only issue I have is with repeated black screens. Often I will have to restart my fire in order for the game to appear.
B0053O89JM|4.0|With the purchase of season eight, we now have the entire series. When there Is nothing on television, my wife will say &#34;how about putting on an episode of &#34;House&#34;?
1401941893|4.0|I have no daughters. As my sons are dating more, I wanted to peek into the minds of the newest generation of women to explore  what they're thinking about life, love, relationships, themselves and their world. This book encourages young women to believe in themselves to proceed confidently with passion toward their goals. Acknowledging they define themselves, their goals and strategies to make it happen on their terms. They are having an  impact on those around them; friends,  children, spouse, family and their world. I liked the emphasis on taking care of themselves to have the energy to do it all and have it all in due time. I don't recall such when we were coming up; things seem to be improving a bit.<br /><br />There is repetitive support and reinforcement through various concepts and affirmations. It's light reading and a bridge into the younger generation for Hay House. I expect Miranda Kerr to leverage her past accomplishments and produce more books and products under the Hay House umbrella that enlighten and enrich her path  into authorship.
B008602KQI|2.0|I fell asleep three times watching this movie. I give it two stars because it was compelling enough that I actually went back to try to watch it. In the end just silly, poor acting and a let down. Overall, quite forgettable.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|I had been looking for this for some time and spent a couple of days after it's arrival watching all the Discs through. Fabulous and I am glad to have found it.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I've never been a huge Bond fan, but this movie held my attention for over 2hours. Good plot and great acting. Javier Bardem was the ultimate villain.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|I liked it but I was a little young for me. The recommended age for me is 16 and up.

B005OCFGTO|5.0|All movies included! What more could you ask for? Okay, maybe you like special features. But I love marathoning these!
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|The book itself is entertaining; however, I did not realize that buying the Oprah Book Club Edition for Kindle. When you touch the highlighted portions, it opens up a page that includes the quote and Oprah's commentary- which is fine for those who appreciate her point of view, but for those who just want to read the story, it's an obstacle.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a fun game and I reccomend it for kids. Its not too easy but there's lots to do. Definitely a good game to play when bored.
B007STXHTM|5.0|Used this on 4 dives and several snorkel trips in St Thomas and it worked well. I like the fact you don't end up with a circle view like my other case. The red filter from Polar Pro made a big difference to. One camera with and one without really showed how well the filter worked. For snorkeling in bright sunlight though it can be to much red so using the snap on filter may be better way to go.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Caught this on sale for five bucks and its worth so much more.  I don't read much but this held my attention.
B003B02O14|4.0|another great read by John Grisham...he never fails to captivate with a good story. easy to read and fun to read.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Awesome.  We download some Peep and the Big Wide World and then hit the road.  Saves me money instead of having to purchase content.
B009AJD5E0|1.0|Scenes have some logic errors in them or I missed something, (sorta spoiler) one scene in particular the main character is in quarantine and hits some people to get out; she was never pursued after after that. I could go into more scenes, but will let you decide.
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|typical old time Bon Jovi - gotta love it!  Jon never seems to age and his voice makes him one of the greats.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game has occupied so much of my time. You don't need to spend money on it or spam friend either, which is awesome. Great graphics, too!
B000G1ALRK|5.0|Love all of Eric Churchs music.  I hope he continues to create great music for a long time to come/
B008K8VDPU|5.0|So much for this fantastic AND free app!  I am almost seventy years old and never learned to play a musical instrument.  Thanks to you I can try at my own pace.  Who knew I would ever learn to appreciate modern technology this much???  I have always been the consummate naysayer...then my son gave me this Kindle for my birthday, now I am totally hooked!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Cannot beat Nicholas Sparks' stories - usual great job. Always find it difficult to put Sparks' books down - read in record time.
B000002OK3|4.0|I bought this disc as the best and cheapest way to get George Baker Selection's: 'Little Green Bag'. Lots of excellent bonus stuff on it too.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I enjoyed the writing, it had a decent plot and quite a bit of humor as well. Definitely worth reading.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book loved the movie so started reading the books about to start the second book and then read all of them
B009NY43NY|3.0|This was a good book... couldn't put it down but not thrilled with the ending. Kinda feel depressed over it. I feel like I need to go reread a couple books back and pretend the story ended there...
B001AJVR5M|5.0|A Little Bit Longer is an album where you will find some songs that are so emotional, song that you can identify. One of them is A Little Bit Longer, this song is like a theme to me because it makes you feel better and don't give up when things don't turn the right way. Nick Jonas is such an amazing writer :') ... You have to get this CD ! :)
B0075MFS9Y|3.0|i only like 2 songs on this cd.  but the 2 i like are excellent.  should have just bought the 2 songs from itunes
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I put off reading the Hunger Games Trilogy for a long time but when I needed a good long read, I thought I'd give it a try. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Suzanne Collins creates a compelling and believable world and a story that is not half as gruesome as one would think from the synopsis. And unlike other trilogies each book is even better. Great story. And leaves you thinking about our world today.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Like many, I didn't see this in the movie theater.  The marketing of the movie left much to be desired.  While I am sure that the fans of the original books will have something to gripe about (purists always do), I really enjoyed this movie based on its own merit.  The soundtrack is amazing and the special affects are incredible.  One indication that a movie hits me is, after the ending, I am left wanting more.  Since the movie didn't do very well at the box office, I am afraid that I will be left wanting more for a very long time.  It's a shame, as I know there is a body of work that the writers have to draw from that would justify many more installments.  Hopefully, Disney (or another company) will take a chance on John Carter and produce a sequel.  With a smarter marketing campaign, I am sure that the movie's bottom line would be much better than the first!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is a great game for anyone who is a fan of iron man.  It has good game play and decent graphics
B006LSZECO|2.0|Very disappointed in the ending.  I felt that she should have been punished.<br />She shouldn't have been able to get away with murder.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse is a great deal. It is very comfortable, and has a good look. It is also very functional, as you can adjust the functions of the various buttons. I highly recommend it.
B004SOR4H6|2.0|Do like who's making comments and celebrities pics. Like fb better . Maybe when I become more use to it may rate it better .
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I am still getting used to the app, but so far it's organized, easy to use, and I never have any problems with it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is one of the few moments where the storyline and the writing improve from book to book. Mr. Howey does not take his readership for granted: He establishes and maintains quality writng AND storytelling with each subsequent book. I am eagerly awaiting Dust...his next book in the series. I highly recommend Wool to anyone who enjoys a psychological study of human nature under apocalyptic conditions
B0086700CM|5.0|I play games on my iPhone & iPod quite often, and this is one of my favorite games. It can be a challenge when first using it, but once you get the hang of it, it's really fun and quite addicting! Good graphics also.
B0029QRA1U|3.0|This is a cheap way to convert old records to digital format.  Cheap has its upside and its downside.  Quality of the turntable is about what you would expect...poor.  Mine was too slow and slowed further upon playing.  The instructions didn't say anything about the adjustments you find underneath...which ended up helping.<br /><br />The conversion to digital requires that it work with iTunes.  Mine wouldn't.  I reloaded iTunes, I reloaded the Ion software..still wouldn't convert.  When it doesn't convert you get nothing stored.  Finally I followed all of the links to a help page that suggested that I change the compatibility of the iTunes and the Ion programs using a right click on the icons on the desktop.  Once I made them both compatible with Windows 7 (which I use)..voila...it works.<br /><br />Once it is working it is very easy to use.  Now that I'm doing it I realize that most of my old records aren't worth converting..ha ha jokes on me.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This app is super fun & addictive. If you're playing with a friend, or even just a stranger, it's always a really fun game that makes me laugh a lot. Always something new to draw! There are also different font colors to buy, so there is always a color for everything!
B00AGKHFCA|5.0|My Mother loves Bocelli and couldnt be happier with this CD! She actually says its her favorite thus far! I would suggest purchasing!
B000056H24|5.0|Powerful Movie! I especially like when Jesus (Yeshua) calls lazarus from the tomb! Beautifully moving  Musical score, sets the mood for The Greatest Story Ever Lived!
B0070DOHQS|4.0|Works really great with WiFi - but when my phone doesn't have a WiFi signal, it wouldn't connect. But I can't necessarily fault this program for that. My cell phone connection may have been pretty slow.
B00CRR5YA0|2.0|This soundtrack lacks a great deal and is the least likeable of any of the Star Trek soundtracks. The music, like the movie, jumps all over the place. With the exception of a couple of tracks, there are no new themes at all. I've read elsewhere that this film is Giacchino's first sequel he's ever scored. I listen to ST music over and over again, but this music just doesn't have any staying power. Hopefully he can do better with the next film.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I read Baldacci on and off.  I am loving his character, John Puller.  I want to read more to see how the character develops.  I loved the plot and the suspense was great.  The ending did catch me surprised!!  Great book to read!
B00CATSONE|5.0|This is a fascinating look at the life of one of the finest creative minds in history.  Edison may have over shadowed him, however his work was stellar and may have been appropriated in Edison's inventions as I have heard he was not a nice person.
B007ZTN07O|5.0|I downloaded this app with a little hesitation. But it was worth it.<br />I got it to work by re-downloading  it. Yes it does take you for a website, for those who were wondering  but you can play without WiFi. Also the website does not ask for much information. My only complaint is that this game is 5 dollars. I would go for 3 at most, but still a great game and totally worth getting.
B009NY43NY|5.0|After reading all 13 Sookie Stackhouse books plus some short stories I have to say I'm not disappointed with the last book.  All the characters I love came back for a peek and that was &#34;real fun&#34;.  Some questions are answered and the tale is a good story to follow and I didn't guess the mystery culpret, so that made me jump.  I really enjoyed every word.  I think it was better than the last two.  These books came in like a lion and went out like a lamb.  Thank you Ms. Harris for a fun few years.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I love a good dirty book, but after first one, the scenes and characters grew tiresome. I didn't even move on to the last book. Maybe it's just me so don't avoid buying it on my account.
B001EN71CW|5.0|One of the best tv shows ever made. Whedon's a genius.<br />It also has a lot of great extras. Fabulous.
B005K17RU0|5.0|great<br />for what I use it for. need to shorten review so can get out if they want more reviews.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the audio, I can work and listen to the word of God at the same time.  So far I have not found anything I dislike.
B00B1E6FF8|3.0|It was good to watch it the first time thru.  The story line isn't worth watching a second time in my mind.
B006UV8DJS|5.0|I saw other people's reviews and I don't know that they're talking about. It worked fine for me! It's really fun and it does lots of cool color effects. I'm glad I didn't read the reviews before I got it because I probably wouldn't have gotten in from the way they make it sound. I think it was totally worth it though!
B0084IG7KC|5.0|It took me some replays to get what was happening in the story.  But after understanding i, it was worth watching again. Can't wait till the next one comes out.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|did not have proper flash player installed and could not installing kindle fire does not do a lot of things which I am slowly finding out.
B000641D2Y|5.0|This is mine and my husband's favourite movie at Christmas time. It's up there with &#34;It's a wonderful Life&#34;. I don't know anybody who doesn't love this movie!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Having watched and loved &#34;The Wire&#34; on HBO, I was amazed that network television offered such a well done and nuanced portrayal of police.  It ranks right up there with The Wire and Southland.  The writing is excellent and the acting is incredible.  I watched the series on DVD the first time 5 or 6 years ago and I am re-watching on Prime right now.  The series has stayed fresh with plenty of surprises.  I recommend it.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Chose this rating because this series is so good.  Have watched everything up to now 3 times.  Am looking for ward for the next season which is number 4.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|I have been frustrated when the game glitches or crashes (most recent update helped a lot), but I am seriously addicted to this game! It's worth the patience.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|I love the Honor series and totally enjoyed this book.  I highly recommend it but remember its one of a series.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Works like a charm. No issues. Love it!! I've been using this for 2 weeks now. This blows my existing optical mouse out of the water.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I can't wait for more! This was unbelievable, similar to Myst on a tiny level. Just wish that it was longer.
B003Z49LYO|4.0|Poor Tess.  Great acting.  A good stepping stone for Gemma Arterton and Eddie Redmayne.  Enjoyed very much. Would recommend it for those who like classic British dramas.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|I have just finished watching the 2013 Blu-ray edition of the BBC/A&E 1995 Pride and Prejudice. We have the 2 previously issued \\"restored\\" DVD editions of P&P (2001, 2010). There is NO COMPARISON! Color quality, clarity and sharpness of image, sound quality are ALL much better than the earlier editions which are marred by washed-out whitish colors especially in the outdoor scenes. Every shot is first-rate cinematic quality.  It was like watching a new film.<br /><br />For Austen lovers, this edition is a must! My wife, who is ultra-critical of picture quality, also found the blu-ray to be outstanding. Prepare yourself to enjoy this wonderful story once again in wonderful true-to-life color!
B004MYF4SS|4.0|Murder in the Outer Hebrides.  A former local arrives to help solve the crime and confront his past,but its much better than this cliche sounds.<br /><br />My only real complaint is that this is obviously the first of a trilogy and was planned as such and as such we have a huge back story placing all the characters in their place.  The mystery is a cheat as well as there is no way the reader could have any chance of solving the murder by clues alone.  But the ending is a ripper.  Just when you thought things couldn't get anymore sordid they do.<br /><br />The author has a background in television and knows how to set a piece.  The characters are pretty one dimensional but his description of a landscape and the character's surroundings are superb. He writes pictures which I love.<br /><br />This is a bleak sad story set in a bleak harsh place, populated by unfulfilled lives but it is a book you have to read if you want to complete the set - I do, so it is time well spent.
B009SPTNGA|5.0|Scissor Sisters nails it again with this album. Great beats and lyrics on most of the songs. My favorite songs are: &#34;Fight Fire With Fire&#34;, &#34;Invisible Light&#34;, &#34;Running Out&#34; and &#34;Skin This Cat&#34;.<br /><br />If you liked Scissor Sister's previous two albums, you won't be disappointed with this one either!
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|One of the neatest things that Netflix did was to release the entire season of \\"House of Cards\\" at the same time. I love bingeing on a series rather than watching it piecemeal as it comes out!<br /><br />HoC is fast-paced, smartly written-and fascinating to watch. The powerful yet sick relationships between Francis and Claire, Zoe and others is impossible to turn away from. It's a pretty sexy series, with lots of steamy close encounters of the no-kids-in-the-room kind. The peek behind the curtain of power politics seems spot on. Machiavelli, eat your heart out!<br /><br />Great series! Can't wait for season 2!
B00COHIFQS|5.0|Mama was a great movie! Original and very suspenseful! I like that it didn't rely on silly things like blood and gore or the same old boring tactics!
1449325947|5.0|This is an enormous tome covering pretty much everything you'll need to know about CSS, but it is put together in such a logical way that it's useful rather than overwhelming.<br /><br />You'll begin with an explanation of the role HTML now has in web design, and why it's worth updating the way you use HTML. In just one chapter, the authors clearly explain the benefits of using semantic HTML, why people ended up doing other things instead, and how to do it right from now on -- plus what to do about Internet Explorer and how to test your HTML across browsers.<br /><br />With that covered, the book moves on to CSS in a very practical way. Begin with how to create a style and style sheet, using selectors to identify what elements to style, style inheritance, and the cascade (that's the C in Cascading Style Sheets). Tutorials help readers try out and fully grasp how the system works.<br /><br />Only then does the book move on to the writing of CSS:<br /><br />* formatting text<br />* margins, padding, and borders<br />* background images and photo galleries, including how to use gradients<br />* styling navigation<br />* transforms, transitions,and animations<br />* styling tables and forms<br /><br />The next section covers CSS page layout, including both float-based layouts and responsive web design. This section discusses some of the issues that are still controversial, clearly explaining pros and cons of different approaches and showing how to do them. Tutorials in this section are set up to allow direct comparisons and testing so you can determine which approach works best for you and your current project. This section also includes a great discussion of fluid images, videos, flash, and high-density pixels -- things that often create problems.<br /><br />The last chapter in this section is on CSS positioning. This section not only teaches you how to use this technique, but also the pitfalls and the situations in which it works best.<br /><br />Finally, you'll come to Advanced CSS, including media style sheets (for pages that may be printed out)and good habits (like commenting and naming styles in transparent ways to make future site maintenance easier). There's also a quick reference section at the back.<br /><br />Each chapter is written in a clear, conversational style, explaining how and why to do the tasks being covered. There are step by step instructions plus special sections like \\"Power Users' Clinic\\" and \\"Workaround Workshop\\" and lots of Notes. The graphic layout allows lots of information without confusion. There are many practical notes (\\"You can live a long, productive life without reading about the selectors in the next few sections..\\" and \\"Nav bars made up of floated elements are hard to center...\\").<br /><br />In short, this is an excellent book for people learning, using, and keeping up to date with CSS. If you own an earlier edition and you're wondering whether you should update to this one, the answer is yes.to Advanced CSS, including media style sheets (for pages that may be printed out)and good habits (like commenting and naming styles in transparent ways to make future site maintenance easier).

B00104GSRE|3.0|I've seen absolutely no reviews for this pressing, so I figured I might as well purchase it, take a chance and write my own.<br /><br />The original album is very muddy sounding. It wasn't recorded too well and though the music itself is great, the original LP sounds muffled and boomy. This might be known as Mountain's \\"signature sound,\\" but I always wanted to hear a cleaner, better version.<br /><br />The pros of this reissue:<br />Clean drums, very predominant in the mix as well.<br />Good amount of bass, not boomy.<br />Crankable, not shrill, can be \\"Played Loud\\" as it says on the cover.<br /><br />Cons:<br />This is what I hate most about it, the EQing. Leslie West's vocals and guitar are buried in this mix. It's almost as if he and his guitar were in another room. The organ on \\"Theme From an Imaginary Western\\" which is usually upfront and a big part of the song itself, sounds almost non-existent.<br />Throughout the whole album, it basically sounds like the midrange was turned down. There's more clarity on certain instruments, such as the drums and rhythm guitar, but on others it's really buried; not muffled, just less present.<br /><br />A good buy? If you want clarity at the sacrifice of some less present vocals and guitar, yes. If you want it all, but without the clarity, I recommend finding a first pressing. I don't think they're too hard to find in good condition.<br /><br />The 2003 CD remaster by Vic Anesini remains my favorite as it seems to combine both clarity and presence. Although this album desperately NEEDS a proper reissue either on vinyl or CD.<br /><br />As far as the quality of the vinyl. It was a bit warped but dead silent. Cover is very nice and the LP even comes in a nice plastic cover.<br /><br />3.5/5 for me.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|Great to have an multiplayer game that I can pick up and put down without finding myself destroyed. Which I do constantly. Only downside is that I can't talk to anyone.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|DDD is the greatest actor alive.  He is completely this character. Boring movie for kids though.  Never really liked Sally Fields.
034580404X|5.0|These books definitely grew on me.  I wasn't sure at first if I was going to like it but something kept drawing me back into them.  By the time I finished the third one I was ready for the movie!!
0810989956|5.0|My kids really like the Wimpy Kid series, and this book has also been fun for them.  One of the teachers at our school told me that it is important for kids to have a diary/notebook to write in, and that as parents we don't need to worry about their spelling or handwriting when they are writing down their thoughts.  It is just important for them to think and write and feel good about the process.  This book prompts kids with the topic, so it is especially great for kids who say &#34;but I don't know what to write about.&#34;
0425263916|4.0|Another series of books that draw you into the lives of the characters.  Just waiting for the third to arrive in my mailbox next month!

B000TEUSJK|5.0|Caligula is a film that takes you front row to the fourth -- & one of the most brutal -- Roman Ceasars. The producer leaves nothing to the imagination, including x-rated sex & unspeakable edicts & killings; as such, we are taken on a journey that gives a feeling of having actually been there.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Fantastic toy for children/adults with special needs. Great for concentration, motor skills, and problem solving. This is a must have.
B001GCUO16|5.0|X-Men: Wolverines answers all those questions you had concerning Wolverine after watching the first X-Men film. Note that, though the story does begin in the 1800s, the bulk of the setting takes place after the X-Men First Class movies.

B00947N6UG|4.0|Critics suck sometimes... I should know, I'm a film graduate and so I often fall into that &#34;critic&#34; category. But this movie is honestly a blast and I'm sad it didn't do better in the theater. It was just poorly advertised, poorly released and critics are tired of almost every animated movie anymore. So yes... this isn't going to change your life or take over Pixar or make animation-haters suddenly realize what they've been missing all these years. Its story is good, nothing epic like Toy Story... but the visuals are gorgeous, the world is fascinating and alive, and if you're even looking at this review, it's because that's kinda what you were looking for anyway, I bet.  (Also, it's nice to finally have a movie that is based more around Easter for once so we can have an annual Easter movie.)<br /><br />My 5 year old LOVED this movie. I had a ton of fun in it too and bought it on day one after seeing it in the theater. It's comparable to How to Train Your Dragon in quality of visuals and storytelling, so if you liked that, you'll like this.<br /><br />Some of the darker scenes can be slightly frightening to younger viewers as the villain is Pitch Black (the Boogey Man) but the movie teaches a good lesson for kids and can be a great teaching tool for some of you with scared-of-the-dark children: (Spoiler Alert!!!) Darkness can be scary and the Boogey Man can be frightening, but in the end, he can't do anything to us if we don't give him the power to. It's also empowering for your kids to see that the human children in this story turn the tide of battle, not those with the super-powers. It's not TOO frightening though- my daughter climbed in my lap to watch the rest of the film but never covered her eyes.<br /><br />Now I don't mean to be offensive- but if you are one of those that looked at Santa in the trailer or posters and said &#34;I can't believe they gave Santa tattoos,&#34; you should probably just skip this and move onto something else (though I'd never get a tattoo myself- just a personal choice). It ruined the whole movie for my mom, my kid's grandma (who was also mad that in UP! they killed the main bad guy (&#34;You can't do that in a cartoon!&#34;)). This world is based on our most beloved holiday &#34;guardians&#34; being a warrior/superhero team when they are not covering their own responsibilities. The premise alone is probably too much for traditionalists... but I personally loved the designs, and the characters embody a sense of adventure as much as a sense of awe and wonder.<br /><br />Action-packed, constantly moving (where did my last 90 minutes go??), heartfelt and attention-grabbing... this movie really does need to be seen to understand what I'm talking about.r get a tattoo myself- just a personal choice).

B000002LB7|5.0|dont listen to the nay sayers. this is good stuff. I like the early Cult music but this is the best. some of the later music is ok too, but only a little of it. Born to be wild is one of my fav covers. Terrific guitar riffs in here. Awesome vocals. 10 or 11 great songs in a row. 80s was a bad time for rock, but this is some of the 80s best. just my opinion
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Denzel created a character that you can emorse yourself in and the storyline. A story about a pilot who is a substance abuser but still manages to control a crashing plane where the people inside survive. After, he is confronted with questions of an empty alcohol bottle. I highly recommend this film.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|My grandson and my son both love this game.  I haven't tried it yet but it does look fun.  My grandson is so happy I received this Kindle Fire because he uses it every weekend when he comes over.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|Jeremy did a good job in the role of Jason. Matt damon would have been out of place in the film because he would have looked too old, since the film takes you back to the beginning. Excellent action sequences and a very good story plot. I recommend it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The room is a fun game. It's got a great atmosphere, that really gives you a feeling of dread, despite nothing frightening really happening. This is the first of what looks to be a series of episodic games so most of this is setup for what is to come. Really enjoyed it and recommend it to people that like creepy puzzlers.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Who knew that Richard Armitage from Elizabeth Gaskell's North and South was behind that make-up playing the King of the dwarfs. He did an excellent job in the role. This Hobbit part one is about Bilbo's story and how he came in possession of the Ring. I recommend it highly.
B006IMY5ZU|4.0|Although it was long it was a really good movie. I liked that it was based on a true story. Worth the money spent!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|As a retired police officer I'll say the cast and plot is  realism. The cast looks, acts,and speaks real life.<br />We live in a world of violence, illicit sex and drug use. The plot and characters fit right into this culture.
0670023329|5.0|Absolutely amazing story. We clearly need to start focusing on the PEOPLE of North Korea, rather than the regime. There's so many there that need our help and yet all we seem to focus on is the works of the Government. North Korea is the people, not the government.

B004G6TD4S|5.0|........and everything in between, it's all great!!! This classic album by ELP features the very acoustic masterpiece FROM THE BEGINNING, which has me playing air guitar all day long after hearing it!!! Another stellar track is the title track (Trilogy), with its many changes and moods. Of course, there's the popular HOEDOWN, which is a concert staple. The rest of the songs are complex, with Emerson in full creative force on keyboards and piano. All in all, this album is a balanced one, and certainly in the top 3 of the ELP catalog. I also recommend their first album, as well as Brain Salad Surgery and Tarkus as a runner-up must-have. All have superior remastering.

Mark VII appeared in The Avengers. In Iron Man 3, there are 42 models.<br /><br />All 42 Iron Man armor suits are featured in the book. They are lined up side by side on a gatefold page from Mark 1 to Mark 42. The Iron Legion, they are called. This is probably the only place you can see all the suits.<br /><br />The suits that appear more prominently in the movie are given more pages accordingly. They are namely, War Machine, Iron Patriot, Mark 15 Sneaky, Mark 16 Nightclub, Mark 17 Heartbreaker, Mark 25 Thumper, Mark 33 Silver Centurion, Mark 35 Snapper, Mark 37 Hammerhead, Mark 38 Igor, Mark 39 Gemini, Mark 41 Bones and of course Mark XLII (that's 42). Those that are briefly or not shown in the book are just on that gatefold page.<br /><br />Overall, there are more suits than in artbook one and two. Besides the suits, there are also concept art for the characters, scenes, locations (not much), and storyboards.<br /><br />The characters are the Mandarin, Aldrich Killian and his Extremis gang. You won't get to see Pepper Potts in the way as shown in the movie and that's a shame. Locations include Tony's Malibu mansion and workshop, Rosehill town, Mandarin's Miami mansion and the seaport. There are quite a few storyboard sequences, about 20 over pages.<br /><br />The art is fantastic, right from the start of the slipcase cover to the end of the 280-page hardcover. Fans who geek out over the film can continue to geek out with this artbook.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />(There are more pictures of the book on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)

0765324849|5.0|A good read for any avid Bioshock fan. Though if you have not played both games you will be somewhat lost. Also as it is written before Bioshock Infinite, there is no mention of Columbia.

193700788X|3.0|I have enjoyed the rest of this series, but this one was a disappointment.  I know not everyone wants the same ending, but this one felt rushed and out of the blue in a bad way. Not my favorite.
0553062182|4.0|Even though I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5, I highly appreciate the author and her contribution to those of us  who sometimes fall between the cracks of somewhere in between \\"normal\\" and having a sensory perception disorder.  I haven't finished the book yet because I am taking my time with it.  The chapter on the infant self is so eye opening as to be something I could take weeks to fully contemplate.  It has helped me, an HSP, much more deeply understand my spouse, a non HSP, and even to understand and feel compassion for my own HSP father better. A lot of resentment has been replaced with understanding.<br /><br />Here is where I think the book lacks:  throughout most of the first half of the book it is suggested or even assumed that HSP's are timid or socially stand-offish.  That could not be further from the truth for many HSPs, including myself, and while the author does spend some time talking about this, throughout the rest of her book she describes perceptions based on her own experience s a timid person.
B006M4F67A|4.0|I like the variety of games offered.<br />I like that it is timed and you can try and beat that time by trying again.<br />It was helpful to read the rules and know that some can be matched that do not look alike.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I started \\"Beautiful Disaster\\" on Tuesday finished it last night (thursday) 5/14 to 5/16 - I have had this on my kindle for awhile and it was time... But as quickly as I read it, and from all that I heard about it I find myself thinking almost to hard describe my feeling about this book.  Well I got it now, this story is my relationship with a boy in High School, that couldn't imagine not being with me, always wondered and suspected the bad.  Travis can't imagine a life without Abby once he connects how much he loves her, but it's almost obsessive boarder lining controlling. Thou I love this love story itself, it doesn't come from a good place, there anger and almost danger.  We have underground fighting, lots of drinking, gambling real life i suppose actually.. Abby is a mess over all I see and understand her need to get away from her youth, but she is so wishy washy in her own choices.  Early into the book the feelings she for Travis are very clear, yet she ponders and puts herself truly thru hell. I can't say I hated this book I didn't but it is was most definitely not in the category of some of the others out there on the top/best sellers.  With that all said it was written great and compelling, I just can't decided that it was a good story overall.

B0091REZMW|5.0|This game was really good and I enjoy playing this game. It will kill time and you will enjoy playing it too.
0385344228|5.0|This book was really fantastic. It's both a legal thriller and a family drama - all rolled up into this complex story that I had a very hard time putting down.<br /><br />What if your child was accused of a murder? Would you support them regardless of the evidence presented? How would your partner react? These are questions you cannot help but to ask yourself as you read. The character progression throughout the story is honest and well written as is the entire family dynamic.<br /><br />Andy is a long time, successful and respected assistant DA, married to Laurie, a psychologist, with a 14 year old son, Jacob, who is quiet and somewhat a loner. They attribute this to typical teen angst. Their world is rocked when one of Jacob's classmates is found brutally murdered. Andy is intent upon finding the killer and making sure his community is safe....until the day he is suddenly dismissed from the case, and Jacob arrested for murder! Suddenly, Andy and Laurie are left questioning their son's innocence.<br />To complicate the story, Andy must tell Laurie that his father is indeed still alive and serving a sentence for murder, and that Jacob may have the `murder gene'. No matter what, though, Andy believes in his son and his innocence. Laurie, on the other hand, struggles with this doubt and the possibility that she may have given birth to a monster.
159514188X|4.0|What can I say about this book other than WOW. Watching this girls world unfold and knowing how it ends before it even begins is like watching the movie Titanic where you know the boat sinks but you still can't believe it happens in the end. Jay Asher has an amazing ability to get you inside the mind of a suicidal young girl.  This book explores how rumors, judgements and the way we treat others has lasting consequences that we may never see.  It can be considered a cautionary tale, to be careful how you treat others because what your actions can have dire consequences.

B00136Q2C0|5.0|Tunnel Of Love is Bruce's most personal and introspective album. After the mega successes of Born In The USA and Live 1975-1985, Bruce took a step back to record a more quiet and intimate record. Bruce had married Julliane Phillips during the Born In The USA madness and love and marriage are the main themes running through the album. Most of the relationships discussed are not happy ones. The couples in \\"Brilliant Disguise\\", \\"One Step Up\\", \\"Two Faces\\" and \\"When You're Alone\\" all face problems that breaking up their relationships. \\"Walk Like A Man\\" is a man who longs for the joy of his wedding day, the title track tells of the rocky ride that love takes you on. The song contains a line that sums up love, marriage and relationships and the album itself. It goes \\"it ought to be easy, ought be simple enough, man mets woman and they fall in love, but this house is haunted and the ride gets rough\\". Bruce's marriage to Julliane fell apart, but the struggle he was going through laid the groundwork for this breathtaking record.
B00846REIS|5.0|Love this series! Such a great book and a great author!  Can't wait to read the next two books!  Great!
B009EFP278|2.0|Entirely disappointed.  This is NOT a new album. Just a remix of the past 2 albums.  I was so sad to not get a fresh dose of Olly!  I love his voice.  Can only predict that the career is going down :-( if the producer is choosing to put out old stuff with a fresh cover.
0062014536|4.0|First thought: Satisfying ending to this series<br />-Different from DELIRIUM and PANDEMONIUM, I loved the dual perspective voices of Lena and Hana - gave a great insight into what was going on outside the walls in the Wilds and inside the walls with the Cureds.<br />-The way Lauren Oliver used the length of chapters to enhance the suspense and urgency in climactic parts or the complacency in other parts was masterful...also the way the chapters end and the next one starts is seamless and helps the story flow so well.<br />-Lauren Oliver's writing style is beautiful and literary and pulls me into the story and the setting.<br />-I've enjoyed this entire series and the whole idea of this society and amor being a disease...it's an interesting commentary on the way feelings can interfere with thinking.<br />-The way the whole storyline comes together in the end and we see how Lena and Hana learn the lessons they learn and have their new perspectives on the world and their lives was great...especially in thinking about the choices we make in life and what those may mean for us.<br />-You know going into it that hearts might get broken, but the whole time you're a little unsure of whose hearts those may be and some may surprise you---of course, that's what happens when you choose love over a lobotomy.<br />-Dealing with very broken characters here who have had their worldview completely shaken and they have to figure out how to survive in a new world.<br />Final thought: The things we would do for those we love...
1476734941|5.0|as most people I have about 15 lbs to loose around my mid section. I tried everything to no avail until my ob-gyn doctor told me about this book. I bought it read it and it really made sense. So far within 2 weeks I have lost 5 lbs and it really is easy and you do not get hungry, in fact you crave the good foods for you and none of the sugars. Great book. And it works!!
B0058UXHHK|5.0|I usually like to savior books, but had to read this in a day so I could get to the end.......love it!!!
0062059963|5.0|The Selection was the book everyone was talking about in 2012. I mean, who can resist a poofy dress and some drama? I certainly couldn't. And so I read it, despite some of the controversy surrounding it. I came out loving it to pieces! And then I had the good luck of having an ARC of The Elite appear in front of me. But would I love it as much as the first?<br /><br />Yesiree!<br /><br />Where do I begin? The Elite was just as fun as the last one, but with a new maturity to it. There's still plenty of the silliness and drama, but the plot is thickening. Things have been narrowed down, the stakes have been raised, and soon the final decision will be made.<br /><br />I loved the way the competition was progressing. With it narrowed down to only The Elite, the girls have more responsibilities placed on them, in the form of reality-show style challenges that reminded me of shows like The Apprentice and Design Star (I don't know how intentional that was, but it was super funny!) We also got to see how the girls act with one another, knowing that if they aren't careful, they'll be picked out!<br /><br />And now...the boys.<br /><br />Let's start with Aspen. He's kind of a jerk. And he's back in the picture. A strange coincident landed him as a castle guard, and so he and America are running into each other quite frequently, leading America to reevaluate her feelings for him. But he hasn't changed at all. He's still a jerk!<br /><br />I'm kind of conflicted when it comes to Maxon. I loved him even more than I did in the Selection and then he did some things that didn't sit well with me. Or America, for that matter. These were the brief moments when America wanted to go back with him, and I almost agreed with her. But then he went back to being all amazing and I'd forgive him for everything. By the end I was swooning like crazy over him.<br /><br />America is a difficult character. She's very independent and strong-willed which I admire, but she also doesn't think things through and is indecisive, which can be very irritating. She also seemed to be pushing people away from herself, which really affected her relationships in the book. In the end I think I really liked her, though.<br /><br />The writing was a vast improvement to that in The Selection, which made for an overall more enjoyable experience. Kiera is definitely an author I look forward to reading much more of (especially if Maxon is involved).rough and is indecisive, which can be very irritating.

B009LDD5HW|2.0|Fair warning - this review contains spoilers!!!<br /><br />I really loved the first two seasons of Glee, but the past two seasons - and especially this fourth season - left a lot to be desired. To be honest, season four was my least favorite season so far. This was due to several reasons: the mostly bad writing, the constant neglect of important lead characters like Kurt and Santana, the screwed-up and unbalanced storytelling in the Klaine storyline, and in large part also due to the fact that the uninteresting new characters on the Lima side got way too much focus and screentime (the writers basically shoved them at viewers with a big fat blinking \\"Love them or else!\\" sign over their heads, which had pretty much the reverse effect on me - and on many others from what I've heard and seen).<br /><br />Now, I'm not saying that introducing several new characters is generally a bad thing - other shows have done it successfully, after all. This was not the case with Glee, however. I found all the new characters at McKinley incredibly flat and boring, and their storylines were mostly rehashed plots from earlier seasons. I gave them a chance in the beginning but actually started fast-forwarding through almost all their scenes halfway through the season (and will continue to do so next season as I really have zero interest in anything they do or that happens to them). The choir room dynamic also isn't the same anymore. The new \\"New Directions\\" just simply do not have the same spark that the old ND had.<br /><br />Sadly, the more interesting premise of Rachel and Kurt (and later on also Santana) in New York got very little focus and screentime. Their scenes often felt a bit random and disjointed, and I won't pretend to understand why the writers treated their two most interesting characters (played by two of their best actor/singers) like unwanted stepchildren for most of the season. Kurt barely got any scenes in most episodes, and when he did it was often only to give pep talks to Rachel. Now, Rachel did get a few storylines, but those weren't particularly good. I mean, there you finally have Rachel Berry with all her ambition in the city of her dreams - and the best storylines the writers can come up with are a semi-feud with a teacher, a pregnancy scare, and a boyfriend who moonlights as a callboy? Really, Glee? The NY side definitely needed more build-up and better storylines - something that I hope the writers will fix in season five!<br /><br />Another thing that bothered me was the way the Klaine storyline was told in season four. I'm not even going to go into how OOC it was for Blaine to cheat on Kurt (and so quickly too), and how little build-up that storyline had (we are supposed to believe that Blaine felt neglected enough to cheat because Kurt was a little busy/preoccupied during his first couple of weeks at his new job? Really? Sometimes I wonder if the writers of Glee have ever been to real life).<br /><br />The biggest problem was the aftermath - the writers focused almost exclusively on Blaine (the cheater) all season long, while Kurt was mostly only a silent spectator who got to stand and listen while others talked at him. While Blaine got to sing several songs about his pain/feelings, and got to talk about what he wants and feels with several people (including Kurt's father), Kurt did not get to sing about his pain and also wasn't allowed to have even one single serious conversation about his feelings with any of his friends (Rachel, Mercedes or Santana all would have been good choices) or his dad - and one or two talks like that would really have helped makes his actions especially in the second half of the season easier to interpret and understand. In essence, with the sole exception of two or three short scenes (over the course of 18 episodes) Kurt did not really get to show or express his thoughts and feelings at all. Because of this, their storyline was hugely imbalanced and often felt disjointed. And I have to say it saddened me to see that one of the strongest characters on the show was turned into a pale shadow of himself with almost no voice or agenda of his own. By the end of the season it was clear that Kurt and Blaine were friends again, and perhaps even on the road to a reunion - however, it would have been nice if Glee had actually shown us them rebuilding their friendship rather than just present it as a fact.<br /><br />The music selection also wasn't all that great in season four. Sure, there were some great performances that are definitely memorable - It's Time, Homeward Bound/Home, Being Alive, Oh Holy Night, Come What May (which has possibly the most gorgeous cinematography ever seen on Glee), and The Scientist come to mind - but overall I didn't find the selection very good. This also shows in that I've never bought fewer songs in any season than in this one.<br /><br />Overall, the bad clearly outweighed the good in season four of Glee which is why I can't give it more than two stars.<br /><br />My hopes for season five are that the writers will start to slowly shift the focus away from Lima and more towards New York - especially when the current seniors graduate. Some of them (Blaine, Artie, perhaps Sam or Tina) are almost certainly bound for the Big Apple which means that all the fan-favorite lead characters will be on that side eventually. Personally, I'm simply much more interested in seeing Kurt, Rachel, and the other graduates in New York than in watching the boring rehashed storylines with the bland newbies on the Lima side.

B008Y73940|5.0|This movie was a BIG SURPRISE!  I was bored and thought this movie would pass the time.  I expected a movie about a typical defense lawyer - Give me the money or I won't help you!  Instead, I got a super thriller about a man looking for an innocent client and not recognizing it when it is right in front of him.  And someone else who uses that blindness to his own advantage.  Great movie!

B007BVOEPI|5.0|I grew up in the 70s. Yeah, you know, Three's Company, etc. This series is so well-done, I can't get the characters out of my mind. i didnt yet read the books, so the story line is exciting and unpredictable. The characters are well defined, yet all flawed and human so that there are skewed lines between good versus bad, for the most part. The cinematography is just ridiculous for tv, as are the costumes. Worth the price of HBO just for this one series! Am I going overboard? If I am, it's because I just got off a binge of the show wherein I started with season 1 and I'm now current over the past week.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|I work with young adults and was glad I purchased this movie. They have been watching so many vampire movies and TV shows about vampires but they repeatedly ask me to bring it back to the dorm so they can watch it again and again. I think it is much better than the live action shows they watch with a much better message.

B004529NLG|5.0|This movie is awesome.  I couldn't find it anywhere in stores that had all 3 versions as well as a digital copy.  I wanted to have it to put on my iPad.

B005LAIIHG|3.0|I saw this film of my favorite book on the big screen in 3D and thoroughly enjoyed it. Unfortunately on the small screen and not in 3D it looses much of its visual impact. Still a wonderful story faithfully represented from the book allowing for the two hour limit of movie viewing.

B000JIHP88|4.0|This is the second one I have purchased. I had one for my first son and now one for my second. I am having a few issues with the remote but didn't on the previous one. Fisher price is really good about replacing items if the malfunction so I am not worried about it. Even with the remote problems it is still a great mobile.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|It may not be the most exciting book but it definitely entertains you from start to finish. It'd like being in the brain of your average high school nerd. Good read
B00992CF6W|5.0|build what ever u want when u want and where you want best game ever every one should buy this game its awesome
B003HARV3Y|2.0|My son and I loved the book and were excited to see the movie.  I know it's such a cliche to say that the movie wasn't as good as the book, but that really is the case here.  They just didn't do a very good job of it.<br /><br />They changed Annabeth so much that at first I thought she might be Clarisse.  Some of our favorite scenes from the book were completely left out.  We got about halfway through the movie and didn't bother finishing it.
B001F5M9MG|5.0|5 dollars. What a deal and you get the best of zz top. I truly love this album and all that's on this play list.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Game is great! Not a copy of angry birds! Played the entire with no IAP besides dont be cheap life isnt free.
159562015X|5.0|Better than personality typology assessments - especially in the workplace - at developing teamwork and individual productivity.  Though the book offers suggestions for working with all strengths, it's not always helpful.
B0067R0APK|3.0|My device info: htc One X; Android version 4.1; Paranoid Android ROM<br />It fetches the current weather just fine, and serves well as a general purpose weather app.  The widget's appearance is nice and subdued, with simple text and line-drawing style icons.<br />The main program interface has plenty of goodies; there are graphs and charts and an hour-by-hour breakdown of the day's forcast.<br />It also has a &quot;lifestyle&quot; feature that's intended to tell you if the current conditions favor whatever activities you have planned. This part's pretty useless for me.  Even though the ranges for acceptable temps, precipitation, etc. are customizable it gives me messages such as &quot;It's a poor day for outside fitness, the tempurature is just right.&quot;<br />I caught this app on sale, so over-all I can't complain, but I'd be a lot less happy with it had I paid full price.
B00A8MGLAI|1.0|Anyone wishing to torture themselves for three hours? Just watched the just released Tom Hanks movie (widely acclaimed) \\"Cloud Atlas\\".  The movie was so bad I actually thought of taking my own life before the three hours was up, but I stuck it out, hoping...against hope. I'm still sort of speechless as I try to give this movie some type of objective review, even a good word, but I can't. I have no idea how a film editor would even know where to begin, and I'm certain that the director must have gotten lost somewhere within the first 20 minutes of this mess.<br /><br />I'm usually not hard to please, but I found no redeeming value in anything. Sorry. Too bad there aren't zero stars.
B00992CF6W|5.0|best game ever just more portable<br />just wish it would catch up to the PC version<br />only gripe is that i cannot use the better than wolfs mod
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Listen to it 2 or 3 times, and you will really love it.  Not quite Violator or SOFD, but still good in its own right.
B004LRNYJW|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  It isn't your standard horror/vampire flick but I thought the acting was good and the story was entertaining and original.  I've seen the original as well and liked them both.
1591844096|5.0|LINCHPIN is a power-packed page turner offering a mind-expanding  invitation to re-invent yourself to meet the challenges and opportunities of today and tomorrow.  Seth Godin's presentation is equally appealing to the novice and the expert.  Caution: don't read this book unless you are open to making yourself  &#34;indispensable.&#34;  Liked the book so much I bought two extra copies to share with my family members.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Always been one of my favorites. Now that a movie has been made the stickler in me goes and compares the differences.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I recommend this movie. The story is great and a nice change from the usual subjects portrayed in most movies  A must see
B000O8OTNC|4.0|It has two slots for your different blade requirements and a fold out sharpener for the big stuff..I use it on my tomahawk, knives of all sizes, and axes pretty great buy
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I loved this movie. It moved fast and had a story that is still fresh and painful in Americans memories
B00001ZT6Z|5.0|even though this is not a DIO era sabbath album, the vocals soar and are almost as great..Tony martin really delivers on this one..it is extremely rare and out of print..I was happy to see it priced around $20 when i bought it..if you are looking for the heavy , spooky stuff that metal is supposed to be, look no further..this is IT!!
B00AQCMK32|4.0|I enjoyed the game, especially since it allowed me to choose my staff and such in a very well defined system, but the game development system feels cluttered and the lack of good combinations can be annoying.
B004VMUS9G|1.0|This alarm clock doesn't know the difference between am and pm.  I woke up late for work.  It was going off when I got home.
B009MYARIK|4.0|I liked this book, didn't love it.  Don't get me wrong -- Sophie is a wonderful writer and this book is as funny, witty, somewhat hilarious, as you would expect from her.  But the pace is probably not the way I thought it would be.  I recommend it, anyway, as this is an imaginative story, in a nice setting, with a perfect ending.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|i rented this film for the kids and did not watch very much of it, so i cant really give a review, but the kids have asked me to rent it several times since then so it couldn't be too bad.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|Everyone gives a unique and memorable performance.  The movie has style and grace mixed with just the right amount of violence like similar films before it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's aca-awesome. I'M KINDA A PITCH PERFECT DRAMA QUEEN  . Well mine craft is an awesome game get it<br /><br />!!!##!!!!!!!
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|Came in great condition. I love this movie! Could watch it every night. It makes me smile!!! You should try it.
0739366416|4.0|nice read enjoyed the book very much will tell my friends about how good a read this book was amen
B000FBJFSC|3.0|I found the book to be a very moving story of an Irish family who faced gut-wrenching poverty with fierce determination.  McCourt is effective at characterizing the shame and suffering that poverty forces on his family, but it appears that many critics think that the squalor that is conveyed is exaggerated.  In reading the book,  I kept hoping that there would be some respite from the squalor, but it seems that it was endless and it became very tedious.  I am not suggesting that poverty is not excruciating, but I believe that the exaggeration leads to mental exhaustion that almost has the opposite effect.<br /><br />Despite these reservations, however, the book is well worth reading.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I'm glad when I get to read the written works that inspired such an awesome movie series. Curiosity for the best of me & in glad it did.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|This book is worth reading especially if you have kids.<br /> It hits close to home.  I will definitely read more of her books.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|First off, the animation quality in this movie is absolutely beautiful.  Just watching how Merida's (the main female character) long curly red hair moves in a wonder in and of itself.  Animation is just getting better and better.<br /><br />As are the plots for many animation movies.  I didn't see this movie in the theatre, a decision which I now regret.  But I sat down to watch it based on the idea of a main female protagonist and with a love of all things Scottish.  I was not disappointed.  The humor was great, if crude at times, and the Scots characters covered a spectrum as displayed by the different virtues and vices of each clan.<br /><br />Merida is a princess and is expected to wed one of the three sons of the other three clans.  Her own father is head of the fourth clan, and she discovers a clause so that she can \\"fight\\" for her own hand and takes part in the contests.  Of course, she is a wild girl who can ride, hunt, and shoot with the best and resents her much more dignified and formal mother's attempts to make a real \\"lady\\" out of her.  She resists what she sees as her Fate and so discovers that the question about Princess vs Rebel was never so far apart as she first thought.<br /><br />This is a real mother-daughter picture, one that brings the two together as they fight to overcome the results of a badly-chosen spell.  In-between the funny scenes, we see how they each learn to really see each other, rather than their expectations of each other.<br /><br />The movie has many elements (especially how people speak) woven into the (somewhat) more historical ones, so it will appeal to a modern audience.  Fortunately, it isn't too distracting.  There is enough action that most kids won't get too bored, but I would recommend this movie more for 8 year olds and up than any younger ones.  Highly recommended for young teen girls, the reasons for which will be obvious if you watch the movie.<br /><br />Not my absolute favorite animated movie, but right up there.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game was as fun game it's as fun as the Xbox edition with everything in it I love it it's so addictive as the Xbox and pc u guys should buy it!!!!  :-)
B009UX2YAC|3.0|A great fun game again spoiled by the need to buy tokens in order to make it last more than a few seconds, would rather pay for the game and enjoy more game time and levels however this seems to be the normal for the \\"free game\\" culture th grade days, otherwise a lot of fun in short bursts.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I can honestly say there is nothing as great as Pinterest! There are the most incredible things on here!! If you're not addicted yet, you will be.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I think it would be better if you weren't having to wait on lives that drives me so crazy ugh
B001KZG99A|4.0|Robert Downey adds the necessary personality to make it more than just a special effects movie. Of course, I was looking for more in the relationship with Pepper Potts, but I guess that's what sequels are for!
B00COGXX7A|4.0|Loved it as a classic love story but it wasn't much more than that So if you are looking for a classic love story very lifetime movie if ya know what I mean
B00288KNJU|4.0|The storyline is a little too frightening for younger children. Also, some of the images in the film are a little to graphic, even Coraline exclaims of one of the characters who is scantily dressed is &#34;wearing no clothes&#34; or something similar. But it is artfully done. It's a beautiful thing to look at.<br />The anaglyph 3D effects are good and can contribute to the storytelling. However, some of the scenes were shot in flat 2D and intermixed.<br />Overall, it's a quirky, clever story for older children and for adults who like stories a little odd and edgy. A fun little roller coaster of a ride.
B00BOUL9DM|3.0|When you leave the game and return to it ; you will not be on the level you left!<br />For example: I am on level 38 but when I return to the game it always starts me at level 14 and I have to start over from there?<br /><br />Other than that - I like the game. But now - I refuse to play it.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Read this book to see the human side of the giant prison that is North Korea.  Poor Shin & the thousands like him in the North Korean prison camps...
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|This movie follows the story in the book very closely, but of course, ya can't beat the book. I was somewhat (pleasantly) surprised with the high quality.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|this is good card game I have been playing it for the last few days and it has been very entertaining. this is a good game if you like card games.
B00BWJ7LYG|1.0|We were SUPER disappointed with this movie... so much so that we didn't even bother watching more than 45 minutes of it.  We read the book together as a family and LOVED it.  But we feel that Hollywood totally butchered it.  It didn't start the same, new subplots were added, new little tidbits that attempted to explain things in the book, new characters... ugh.  Please don't waste your time watching this movie.  Get the book and read it in order to truly experience this story.  The book is long, but very much worth the time it takes to read it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|LOVE IT! It is an AWESOME game!!!!!!!+ people of all ages can play this game! I reason my life closing will like it and they are nine, five, and seven hi I am a portion and this review is very boRing I like one direction
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I ordered this as a gift for my son and since he has not complained about it, I am assuming he's happy!
034580404X|5.0|I loved the first book that I had borrowed from someone and had to get the other two.  Read all in one month!!!  Loved it, thanks!!

B0064MGU98|5.0|Can't figure out why she'd stay with the louse but she's a capable, smart, and tenacious. Law cases are interesting and the characters are like able even when they are despicable.
0788859544|5.0|I purchased this movie after a recent trip to Disney World.  They are many vendors out there, but this one is great!  The movie was packaged securely.  The movie is of great quality and looks good even though it is not in HD format.  Overall the kids love watching the movie and I highly recommend to add to your Disney Collection.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Read the book... liked the movie better. That never happens to me! Guess I found the movie a bit more &#34;accessible&#34;. If there is anyway to view on a big screen, make the effort.
B0036SSZIC|5.0|This film exposes the whos and the whys about how the United States of America, once a nation ruled by people who worked for the common good and democracy has lost its bearings and is now ruled by a greedy, selfish group of plutocrats whose only aim is to enrich themselves. All at the expense of the middle class, the poor, and the needy. Of course, Michael Moore once again calls for a stop to all this and of course, he is called a &#34;communist&#34; a &#34;socialist&#34;, (meant to be insults) more often than not by people who don't have the foggiest idea of what those words mean. Unfortunately, the once great nation is rapidly losing its former prestige and is hurtling down to its decadence.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is definitely the best keyboard replacement that is out there. It also has an awesome word prediction engine and cool statistics.
0785126708|5.0|Man, Hulk is a complete beast in these Comics. If you've read Planet Hulk, this is a definate must to read after!
0061906220|5.0|My grandkids really enjoyed this book.  They have had me read it over and over again.  It also helps them learn their colors.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|The annecdotes + Lab exercises = \\"understanding of the 'intuition of the cosmos' and how to use it\\". Ms. Grouts work is the best self improvement book I've ever read, cause it starts with the 'self'.
B00A2O3U9W|5.0|\\"Diplomacy\\" is a very interesting book, that should be read by all those who are interested in either International Relations, History, or even merely in good books.<br />It covers the period that goes from the Peace of Westphalia, in 1648, to the early 1990's. Somehow, this books manages to give us a very good idea of what happened in that time span, without boring us to death at the same time, and that is not a small merit.<br /><br />\\"Diplomacy\\" was written from the point of view of Henry Kissinger, a controversial man who was secretary of State of USA. Whatever might be said about him, something cannot be dennied: he knows his craft. And in \\"Diplomacy\\" he makes that evident, exactly as he had done previously in other books, for example in \\"The World Restored: Metternich, Castlereagh, and the Problems of Peace\\".<br /><br />His prose is quite elegant, but at the same time easy to read. Kissinger mixtures historical facts with his personal opinions, dissecting what happened and trying to draw conclusions that allow the reader to discern long term trends in history, thus enabling him/her to really understand what happened.<br /><br />I bought this book a long time ago, but I still consider it a keeper. It isn't exhaustive, but it doesn't pretend to be so... On the whole, a book worth buying and having. Recommended :)
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I loved it the first time I watched it and still love it after watching it for the third time.  The movie is absolutely the most creative to come out in recent years.  The build up for the next one is also perfect.  All characters are intriguing and I can't wait to watch more of the Hunger Games reality.
B003VANOFY|3.0|I got these headphones in January of 2012 and they lasted well through the winter of the same year, but after around that time and on a few chance occurrences before that, the charging cable would stop working. I heard that this was from a dead battery and so I went and bought the replacement part online and went through the process of taking out and replacing the battery. The same problem recurred and I decided that it was the place where the cable docks into the headset itself that had gone faulty. I'm hopefully going to be able to leverage a replacement from Logitech directly, but this was a big hassle for a relatively very expensive headset that I'd hoped would at least last me one year. I'm impressed by the ease of use and convenience but I feel that it would be wise to avoid this product unless it is only going to be needed in the very short term.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I thought this was a good continuation of the story.  So many people are critical of these books but you have to read the whole story in order to understand.
B00B7FOQCK|4.0|I Excepted somewhat bigger USB 3.0 but this one is small and compact and works as advertised , Great Product<br /><br />4 stars Why ? Ports can a bit tough to plug in maybe a tad bigger slots would've be ideal.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very engaging and I didn't want it to end!!  The graphics are incredible!  Make it longer and I would definitely spend the money and buy an entire series of this game!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I often have thoughts come to me that need to be included in my dessertation . Many time I can not write them down at the time I us this program on my phone and synic it with my laptop it is a true wonder .
B008GXHOFW|1.0|Downloaded this  for my son but he can't even play it because  it requires an additional 650 +mb download. Don't have that kind of space available  and now I can't  even cancel the order.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is a great tool for meditation. It helps get the rythm of your breathing in synic with your focus, I have found the hard part of meditation is focus and total relaxation this helps relax you and  focus.
B003YNFYCO|5.0|Can't beat the Beatles. This is a great compilation of their songs. I bought this for my dad and he loves it
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Not very impressed with this movie. The story line was so boring as were the actors. I expected more from this film with Tom Cruise being the main character.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I have played several g5 games and this one does not disappoint.  Good graphics. Good story line. Good number of hidden object finds.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|This movie was not what I expected; it was very good. Could have been a little better; the actors were great especially since they weren't big name actors.
1416955070|5.0|City of Bones was a brilliant read, the characters were witty, plot was surprising and it was nicely paced; not too fast to confuse you and not so slow that you get bored. Not that you would get bored of Jace *sigh*<br /><br />Yes, I have fallen into the Jace Wayland fanclub and I am not ashamed to admit it. My latest book boyfriend; and I didn't think anyone could match up to Augustus Waters from the fault in our stars! Not that the two are alike, oh no. Jace is slightly vain, blunt, a leeetle bit arrogant, very sarcastic but can also be quite charming. Hmm, I am not painting a very good picture of him am I? Well, I guess you will just have to read the book for yourself to find out more. Although I can tell you he has the whole bad boy/tortured soul thing, with the closed-off feelings attitude. That is until he meets Clary.<br /><br />I was surprised to find that I liked both the male and female protagonists of this story, usually it's just one or the other. However, Clary is the exception. Born with shadowhunter blood but has no awareness of the shadowhunters, vampires, demons and the other 'mythical' characters her world is made of until one night in Pandemonium where she sees something or someone otherwise invisible. And that is where the story begins<br /><br />I don't want to give too much away here because I feel as if you are worthy of reading this yourself. I'm beginning to sound like Valentine....who, you ask? Read and find out
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|Runs great. Lots of fun for all ages. Haven't had any trouble with glitches. The graphics are really great too.
B001NLL93W|5.0|The third installment in Mortal Instruments series is my favourite so far. Another action-packed series, although it is a lot darker than the previous books. In this story Clary manages to make her way to Idris, the homeland of the shadowhunters, despite Jace protecting (tricking) her into staying home.<br /><br />My main question is how could Valentine mingle demon blood with his own baby's? What an evil, twisted man. When I read this, I thought this child cannot be Jace (or rather, I was hoping it would not be Jace). Usually I am very poor at spotting mistakes but in this case I guessed fairly quickly that Sebastian was the demon son. However that may not have been quite an achievement considering I could not figure out who Jace's father was.<br /><br />Poor Jace, he must be utterly confused by now. He's been told the wrong identity twice, stumbles across his 'dead' father only to be told he was not his real father but had been tricked all his life, falls in love with Clary and then realises Clary is his sister and then that she is not! Phew, I am getting dizzy just trying to keep up, and that's only half of it. I can guess Jace will be very paranoid from now, trying to separate the truth from the half-truths and the outright lies.<br /><br />I thought I would list the main reasons I feel that this is my favourite as yet, and these are:<br />*Jocelyn is cured and awakens from her self-induced coma<br />*The truth is uncovered that Jace is not Valentine's biological son<br />*Someone finally beats Jace in a fight. Don't get me wrong, Jace is my favourite but every now and again even he needs to be brought down to earth<br />*I haven't read the next books in the series yet :P<br /><br />As always, the book leaves you wanting more. Thankfully, there are two more published in this series and then I believe there is a separate series written by Cassandra Clare so that should take me to next week!<br /><br />Favourite Quotes (just a few)<br /><br />\\"Look did you ask meto come all the way uptown just so you could stare at me like I was something in a petri-dish? Next time I'll send you a photo\\" [Simon to Jace]<br /><br />\\"Even if you thought it would help the Clave,\\" Simon said, \\"you'd never let them have her.\\"<br />\\"What makes you say that vampire?\\"<br />\\"Because no one can have her but you,\\" said Simon.<br /><br />Samuel's voice rose to a scream. \\"GO AWAY!\\"<br />Simon looked sideways at Jace. \\"I think he means it.\\"<br />Jace shook his blond head in exasperation. \\"You had to make a crazy jail friend, didn't you? You couldn't just count ceiling tiles or tame a pet mouse like normal prisoners do?\\"<br /><br />\\"There is no pretending,\\" Jace said with absolute clarity. \\"I love you, and I will love you until I die, and if there's a life after that, I'll love you then.\\"<br /><br />\\"I have given everything for this cause. My wife. My children. I have not withheld my sons. I have given everything I have for this- everything.\\"<br />The Angel simply hovered, gazing down at Valentine with his weird, inhuman eyes. His wings moved in slow, undeliberate motions, like the passage of clouds across the sky. At last he said, God asked Abraham to sacrifice his son on an altar much like this one, to see who it was that Abraham loved more, Isaac or God. But no one asked you to sacrifice your son, Valentine.<br /><br />\\"Patience, grasshopper,\\" said Maia. \\"Good things come to those who wait.\\"<br />\\"I always thought that was 'Good things come to those who do the wave,'\\" said Simon. \\"No wonder I've been so confused all my life.\\"<br />\\"Confused is a nice word for it,\\" said Jace
B00BEPVAV8|1.0|Didn't notice how many permissions this particular app needed.  I ended up uninstalling it.<br /><br />Not that it was that expensive, but sucked to have to uninstall the game.
1416972242|5.0|Again, a fantastic read by Cassandra Clare. In book #2 there are more uncovered secrets, more adventure and of course more confused feelings. Most surprisingly, Simon steps up and becomes more confident, self assured and well, a bit of a badass considering he won't die!<br /><br />I loved the scene with the faerie queen, although I sympathise with Simon. He finally thinks there is a chance with Clary considering Jace is her brother, but his hope is short-lived. Although I must say, I am glad Clary gave Simon a chance...We get to see more of Magnus, who is frankly hilarious.<br /><br />The Mortal Instruments series is highly addictive and I look forward to reading more of Cassandra Clare's other books (:
B00A85EMVK|4.0|I did not know this was a Blu-ray 3D combo at the time I purchased it, so what an awesome surprise I had when I received it.  I bought Top Gun as an upgrade for my boyfriend from the old dvd and he was watching it within 30 minutes of opening the present. Best Purchase Ever!
B004GYY714|5.0|better than itunes radio.  can be on the go.  Too bad apple did not put radio on the ipod, but who has podcasts anymore?
B004EPZ070|4.0|I loved the book, so I couldn't wait to see the movie. I highly recommend reading the book first. Lots of build-up has been left out. The movie is still good on its own, but why not give the book a try.  Also, the sequel book is awesome.
B00B671W6W|5.0|I purchased about 15 cd's at once on Amazon and the one I listen to most is the new Anthrax EP of 1980's covers called Anthems. As more of a Testament/Metallica/Death Angel fan I had ignored Joey Belladonna/Scott Ian and the boys. That was a huge mistake. This incredible selection of great songs proves Anthrax can personify greatness. It is is not only perfect, but fun. I can only say that I wish they had recorded 8 more songs. Loud & proud It is worth every penny to be reproduced on headphones or heavily amplified speakers. Actually, I would have gladly paid $30 to own this cd.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|A  balanced presentation of how one person might be spared oblivion by those who went before or to follow them!
B001CB8NQE|5.0|The only bad I can say about Stargate Atlantis is there was no season 6. So to get my Stargate fix I started SG-1.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|It has a tendency to lock up, usually when you are winning. If you could still play with no credits, I would play more.
0802473156|5.0|Great book! I got it to become a better partner in my relationship. Sadly the relationship didn't last, BUT I do feel more prepared for future engagements. And no this book had nothing to do with our breakup. My partner was quite honored I took time to attempt to better understand myself, her, and our relationship. The 5 Love Languages is a great resource for understanding the mindset of your counterpart and the best way to work with them in the relationship...not against.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This has got to be the end of one of the geatest series ever. the story is well written and very exciting. It was really hard to put down. I will miss all the characters, they have become my friends over the years. What a great book this is!!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is a classic for a reason; such good storytelling. It has great pacing and some iconic characters. The aspect I liked the most was the strategic thinking, it's just strategy strategy strategy all the time, and it's fascinating and so satisfying to read when obstacles are introduced and the heroes figure out how to solve the problem. I highly recommend this book (and I know there's a whole heap in the series but its easy to read as a stand alone story)
B00CATSONE|5.0|Icouldn't believe the genius of this man.  One of the most startling things that stood out was his invention of a wingless plane as described in the New York Herald Tribune.  It sounds like the cigar shaped UFOs seen around the world.  The book was very informative and showed you Tesla's genius and many things he invented.
1401937519|5.0|Yeah.... Only after reading the whole book did I understand the photo she chose for th cover of this amazing account of her near death experience and especially...what she learned. So blessed to have come back with the information and to be sharing it now. YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT SHE LEARNED. Trust me! It's the next step to James Von Praags 'Talking To Heaven'.<br /><br />This book...brings meaning to 'Oneness'.<br />I'm a medium, channel... I know myself as an eternal Spiritual being having a human experience. But this book gave me a concept of life after life that I'd never really heard before...Another piece of the puzzle that is SO large... There really are no words. I dont know why I'm trying. You just gotta read this. Period. If for some reason, your attention has been brought to this book, this review - know that this is not an accident!<br />-Just sayin,<br />Gillian Harris.
B008TRUDAS|3.0|I gave slammed three stars. Although the poetry was a large part of the storyline, I couldn't wait until I finished reading it. I detached a bit with each poem.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game just wish that if gets deleted u can reload your game it's truly fun an love traveling the world.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I really enjoyed this game but there is kinda a lot of reading!  If you like these kind d of games you would enjoy it.  It's tricky but not to hard
B004X6PRO6|3.0|An Interesting read.  However it  was confusing at times who was speaking.  The author had an amazing imagination regarding survival in North Korea.
B00BD6KPFU|5.0|Great show, I bought the first season in the states and am waiting eagerly for the next season. Since I'm not a native English speaker (I'm dutch), I would have liked English subtitles as most series have (english for the dead and hearing impaired :-) )

B000N2HBSO|5.0|I am always fascinated by lincoln not only for his antislavery profile or as the one who courageously signed the emancipation act but also by his political ideology.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|The game's great.  Really keeps your brain running, and tests your adjective skills.  Only problem, is that Scribblenauts remix is only available on Amazon for the time being, and there's been issues with people downloading it.  I had to download a copy of it from another source in order for it to install, only now, I don't have access to my world pass. Which is really annoying on other devices.  You get 50~ levels, and a ,'sandbox' theme you can change about at the beginning of the game, if you don't buy the world pass, and if you've got a good enough vocabulary, and know how to form adjectives, it won't take you long to beat the game.  You only get three character models, which is kind of lame, but then comes in more Pay2Play content for character skins.  I hope they'll respond to me soon about the download issues through the marketplace themselves, otherwise it'd be worthless sending them another review based on the device I was using so they could ,'help improve' it on devices like mine, along with the kindle.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is gonno sound stuipid but my sister has it(she eusaly reeds books)and she adora it like you wouldent baleve. (I got nothing else to say).
B005PK56TA|4.0|for it to be censored in exactly how far it can go in the form of gore, language, and all out sexual situations but still a very good story with some good thrills
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I like the idea of jumping over trains in who would have cursed Japan I think its a little copied from temple run I mean the idea but defiantly a good app a must download

B007SYWFRM|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH. Acorns need to be available more with coins and stars. A few more animals would be good
B001F6ZIXW|4.0|This show combines great story elements with strong writing and great production values. The only weird thing is how everybody always runs out of guns. Guns are like a loaf of bread that you have to buy each week. But, the story is very engrossing.
B001F0WXY0|5.0|Beside Asimov's Foundation and Clarke's 2001 Odyssey, Dune is one of my favorite sci-fi books, especially as I read it as teenager and later as an adult and still found it fascinating.<br /><br />Dune is a masterpiece. This time around I went for Audible version thus I got it for Kindle too and got this nice feature \\"Whispersync for Voice-ready\\". It's really great to listen sometimes then sync with Kindle to continue reading.<br />Regarding Audible, performance was great. There are four narrators but they are not \\"on\\" all the time which is shame as it sounds really good, I mean great, bravo! Most of the time we enjoy Simon Vance's voice and his acting possibilities which I found very good so it is not big deal that we don't get full acting performance all the time. Beside mentioned, there is music throughout the book (not all the time) which really push us into the world of the sand and its mystery.<br />Get the Audible, get the Kindle version and enjoy all the way!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Wish there were more games like this one. Really so fun to play I'm having a hard time putting it down. Thanks BFG
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This human interest story is filled with hope and love.  Enjoyed it very much.  Will be one of those movies that you watch over and over again
0670026557|5.0|Charlie Rose interviewed Dr. Adam Grant recently for his talk show on PBS. Because Rose has led me to many outstanding books, plays, movies, historical and political insights over the years, I was already anticipating a good read before the book arrived at my office. And here is my simple appraisal - best psychology book I've read in several years. It is well-written, engaging, clever, persuasive, and as a previous reviewer claimed: life changing! This is one of those rare books that can change one's behavior in a single read. If you like to see behind the curtain of others' behavior (and your own), as well as understand what you are seeing - invest some time with Give and Take by Adam Grant.
B002PEP4C8|4.0|Sebold's account is terrible, sickening, brutally honest but beautifully written.  You really feel her triumphs and pain as the novel progresses.  Though not easy or necessarily pleasurable to read (emotionally), the novel kept me hooked and eager to hear what would transpire next.  I feel like this gives me better context for The Lovely Bones (though I read it after).
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got this app thinking it was like the pc version. I thought wrong. They Don't have half of the stuff they usually have in the pc version if your going to buy just make sure you buy the seed app for it then it gets fun.

B00A8307BG|5.0|I saw Robin in Springfield Oregon twice in the same year.I gave a ticket to a friend from work who also is a guitar player.<br />When the first song started Robin came out searing through three amplifiers at once. My friend turned to me and said &#34; I feel like I'm back in the 60&#34;s again !<br />He put on a couple of the most amazing shows I've ever seen.
B00BIVN82M|4.0|I adore Michael Buble and have most of his CDs. I like his newest but not as much as his others. I think maybe I didn't care for the song selections on this one as much as on the others. But any CD by Michael is better than no CD at all.
B000002UVX|5.0|What a way Jimi had with the blues he injected into his music. This album was so incredible at the time, nothing like it anywhere!<br />And &#34;Machine Gun&#34; really captured the feeling of Vietnam, you felt almost like you were there.<br />And he didn't need two white guys to make the music with him.<br />Funny -- I never thought of Jimi as being a black man -- he was just Jimi!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Not the late nite chatting. Definitely an adult bingo. The game freezes at least once a day, causing lost coins and tickets, but for the most part it is stable. It's my favorite of them all though, definitely not boring!
B00328G4Y8|5.0|It's JIMI !! &#34;Are You Experienced&#34; was the first album I bought when I was a teenager. This album is another great one, he had such a brilliant song writing style. And his playing always amazed me -- how fluently he could go from one phrase to another, it seems impossible the kind of connections he made in a song.<br />The songs on this album are all so different and undeniably Hendrix!.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|I have really enjoyed this movie over the years, from the intial release through all the rebroadcasts on TV.  I'm happy to have this in my collection.<br /><br />I also wish I had taken Dean Wormer's advice to heart when I first heard it: &#34;Fat, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life, son.&#34;  Alas...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great brain workout as long as you go to the higher levels.  Once you start it is hard to put down.

B000JMKO3C|5.0|It is a very read and great way of communicating that every day in our life is a miracle. We should live our life to fullest. Everyone is crazy to some extend and we should dare to be who actually are. No one can communicate this message better than Paulo Coelho. It is a must read once in lifetime.

B009NY43NY|5.0|Charlaine Harris wrapped up her series nicely. The ending I  expected since book 7. She did a good job. Most series doesn't give you the closure you need. However, this book closure made it as if life goes on. There will always be a world in Harris' mind where Sookie & company may return. From this bookI can count 6 dieffenbachia spin offs that could be made without Sookie.<br /><br />Good job Charlaine,looking forward to pieces (short stories) or other books that may include characters from this series.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|So heart wrenching and beautifully written. Always keeping you on your seat for the next scene that will happen. I absolutely loved it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved this book. Its such an amazing story very different from anything Ive read before. So many details that make you feel actually inside the book. The movie its not as amazing a<br />the book but i would reccomend it.
1442358238|5.0|The story was very good and kept me guessing till the end. I like to be surprised by the characters and Mary Clark does a wonderful job at that.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love the free version of Evernote.  I am able to take and save/organize my notes, chores, tasks etc.. This app allows me the freedom to sync over several devices with ease which helps with work home and play.  Highly recommend this app... can't go wrong... for the price it is solid stable and functional.
B006VFLIYK|3.0|This book is just a OK read, I like David Baldacci but his writing  lately has been a chore for him.
B00COGXX7A|4.0|Kinda like Sleeping with the enemy. Would reccomend it. Has a good twist and ending. Wow five more words. Lol.
B003O86FMW|3.0|As an adult reading this book, I enjoy the story, and even some of the underlying political currents.  You wonder why I give this book 3 stars then?  Because of the target audience.  This series is good, especially with regards to some of the undercurrents of social unrest and socioeconomic disparity.  The problem is that a young teenager or tween is not mature enough to completely understand the full breadth of the meaning of the book, and is introduced instead to violence, particularly the violence of children on children.<br /><br />I am not saying do not let your child read this series.  I am saying know what your child is reading and know how it might affect them.  This is one series that reading with the child might be a good idea so you can discuss why things are happening to give the violence context.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great all-around game.  Slightly spooky atmosphere for the steampunk generation.  The puzzles and animations will keep you hooked for hours.  Warning:  Do not start this game late in the evening thinking that you will only play it for a bit before going to bed.  You will get caught up in it.<br /><br />Thanks Fireproof for creating a great game that seems intentionally designed for the Kindle Fire HD.  This game is for people that like puzzles, of the Chinese puzzle box variety, mixed with a little arcana.  I will be watching for the future &quot;rooms&quot; of this brilliant game.<br /><br />Some people complain that this game is too short.  I think it has the perfect length of game play.  Great for a few hours of cerebral stimulation and escape without becoming a major commitment on your life, like many games tend to do.  Enjoy.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|If we lived in an alternate universe where Siouxsie (at her artistic peak) teamed up with Doves (circa \\"Lost Souls\\" or \\"The Last Broadcast\\") with the intent of making the finest and last album any of them would ever make, it would probably sound something like \\"Ceremonials\\" from Florence and the Machine.  With the exception that it may not actually be this good.  Ceremonials is an incredible album, beginning to end, easily keeping pace with or easily surpassing just about any album from the modern era, from The Chameleons UK to The Stone Roses to The Verve and anyone else you care to consider.  It might even be better than \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" from Bob Dylan; at some point and at this level, I suppose comparisons become meaningless.  I don't know where this woman came from, but she seems to have no limits to her artistic passion.  Each song a near-masterpiece, and every vocal performance, although delivered by a girl with an average voice, comes off as an urgent lightning flash direct from the heavens straight to your ears.  The arrangements, the lyrics, the tones, the rhythms, the production; it will hit your brain in a way it hasn't been hit before.  If you love great music, this is it.
B00001OH7V|4.0|i was amazed by this cd this cd was good i hered this was one of the lest best but not for me including heros this cd rocked

B009J2VR3Y|3.0|Love Whitney's hits and more but my only con with the CD is with the track &#34;I look to you&#34;, I would have preferred that it offered the version Whitney sang and added the R. Kelly renedition as an additional track.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Love Ben Affleck and this was a wonderful movie.  Loved the fact that there was no violence in it just someone using their head to accomplish a mission.  We need more of that today.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Great to hear that Boz voice! His selection of songs and his performance is of a very high standard. Can't miss with this album!

B00CL68BK2|5.0|If your looking for a movie to watch as a couple then rent this movie. I could definitely see why this movie was nominated for best picture. The acting was top notch.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|The book started a little slow for my liking but by the end I was fascinated, enraptured. It's very cleverly crafted and having spent 2 weeks in North Korea in 2009 I found the writer had uncannily captured my gut and fleeting impressions. To &#34;imagine&#34; this book into existence is quite an achievement. I found it a significant addition to the dystopian oeuvre of Huxley's Brave New World, Orwell's 1984 and Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale. Definitely worth a careful read.
B009FA98JU|3.0|There are a few different types of DVI cables/adapters, this is a DVI-D adapter, NOT a DVI-I adapter. I feel this is importent to mention, as the product description only lists this as &#34;DVI&#34;, and standard DVI cables are typically DVI-I.<br /><br />The difference is that DVI-D adapters, like this one, lack the four analog pin holes that are found on DVI-I cables (found above and below the long, horizontal pin hole), and therefor are NOT compatible with DVI-I cables.<br /><br />In other words, before you buy this, be sure to check that your DVI cable is DVI-D and not DVI-I. If you are confused as to which is which, just do a google image search to get some clarification.<br /><br />Hope this helps.
B001I0T92Q|5.0|This MicroSD adapter works great in my Sony PSP.  I'm using a 32gb MicroSD card and now I have enough space for my games and music.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|I liked it. A good read on my kindle. Read it during work outs. Would recommend to those that enjoy the series.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|Heading out to the premier of the new movie and I wanted this one fresh in my head.  A &#34;well done&#34; reboot of this genre.  Now to get the execs on TV to pay attention.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|&#34;The Martian&#34; really reminded me of the pulp sci-fi that was lying around when I was a kid, in that a lot of the tension of the story is created by anxiety about resources (food, water, fuel) in near-future space journeys using technology not much better than our own.  The world of the story is completely contemporary, however. There's a lot of thoughtful, dark humor I really enjoyed.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|The acting and story are top notch.  This show will hook you in and become addicting.  It is definitely worth your time.
0316098329|5.0|Until I read the reviews, I wasn't sure what I was reading.  But, as soon as I did, the book took off for me.  It was different and imaginative, and I couldn't put it down, wondering what would come next.  She was a good mother, and I loved that little boy.  I've passed the book on to my daughter for her to enjoy.

B008XBASVY|5.0|great book worth every penny.i just couldn't put it down . the ending sucked but i still loved every word
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Great piece to add to your collection.  We have watched it multiple times and enjoyed it each time.  It is intense though through some of the scenes.
B001EBYM8A|5.0|Harrison Ford is known as one of the biggest stars in the world having been in some of the highest earning movies of all-time (Star Wars x 3, Indiana Jones x 4, Witness, Patriot Games x 2, Air Force One, etc.,) and The Fugitive is right there near the top of the list. Ford jumped into an already established role (Dr. Richard Kimble) which is something new he brings to his roles. On the other hand, Tommy Lee Jones stole the movie (and an Oscar) as Marshall Samuel Samuel Gerard.<br /><br />It makes no difference if you are familiar with the history of the Fugitive, the one-armed man or the classic TV show. This movie is updated so seamlessly that it makes no difference that there was a TV show that aired thirty years earlier for four years. If you enjoy crime-thrillers, pictures with people that were wrongly accused, and movies that have tight action sequences, well, here is one of the best ones available.
B005LAJ16I|2.0|It is not for family viewing.  Adult themes.  It is not &#34;24&#34; where everyone could watch it.  Should be rated &#34;R:
015601386X|4.0|Excellent condition, classic child literature in added language for grandson to grow into. Not quite two already reads many German words and phrases as well as native English.
B00BB67UNW|2.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />Broken City, for me, is one of those films that knows where it wants to go, but the execution is underwhelming. You have big names Mark Wahlberg and Russell Crowe together in a political cop-drama and that should be a recipe for success, but somewhere along the line things fell out of place and what we're left with is Broken City. A film that attempts to be more complex than it needs to be and, ultimately, more complex than it can handle.<br /><br />Broken City starts with NYPD detective Billy Taggart (Wahlberg) killing Mikey Tavarez, a man accused of raping and killing the sixteen year old sister of Billy's girlfriend Natalie Barrow (Natalie Martinez). After getting arrested and going to court, the verdict was that Billy killed Mikey in self-defense so he couldn't be charged with manslaughter. However, he was forced to quit the force.<br /><br />Seven years later we find a near-bankrupt Billy who's now a private detective. Then one day he gets a call from Mayor Nicholas Hostetler (Crowe) who was responsible for getting rid of Billy's convicting evidence seven years ago. Hostetler is convinced that his wife Cathleen (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is having an affair, so he wants Billy to find out who she's seeing behind his back. Billy finds out that she's seeing Paul Andrews (Kyle Chandler). Andrews is the campaign manager for Hostetler's election rival Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper), a man who's doing everything in his power to prove that Hostetler is as crooked as they come.<br /><br />Now I'll stop it there, but judging from that brief summary it's safe to say that this sounds like a pretty entertaining movie, right? Maybe a little clichéd, but one that could still be enjoyable if done right. Unfortunately that's not the case because as soon as we find out that Cathleen is seeing Paul Andrews the entire thing gets out of control and before you know it everyone and their mother is involved in some convoluted scheme to bring down Hostetler. If you ask me the movie derails about halfway through because once you reach that 50 minute mark that's when it started to get bad.<br /><br />What turned me off even more is that there's not one interesting character in here. Scratch that, I loved Billy's assistant Katy Bradshaw (Alona Tal). Unfortunately, her role is as minor as they come so it's not like she has enough time to save this train wreck. Billy struck me as an annoying ass who didn't know how to handle things like an adult and Hostetler was your cookie-cutter crooked politician. There's just an extreme lack of creativity in the character department because it feels like we've seen all these characters before in other films of this genre.<br /><br />Honestly, the only positive thing I can say about the film is that everyone involved did solid job. Wahlberg gave another Wahlberg performance. So if you're not a fan of his don't expect to have your opinion swayed with this film. Zeta-Jones gave a nice performance, but she doesn't get a lot of screen time. Crowe gave an enjoyable performance as well, but was crippled by the generic-ness of his character. This was my first time seeing Alona Tal in a film, but I really liked what I saw. Then again, I think part of that had to do with the fact that she was the only cast member with an interesting character.<br /><br />Overall Score: 4.5/10 - My biggest problem with this film is that it lacks anything unique. We've seen these scenarios before and almost all of them have been done better. Then it suffers from a second half that lacks any sort of cohesiveness which makes it feel like a punishment to get through the entire thing. I would have a hard time recommending this to anyone, but if you're really itching to see it I would suggest a rental or Netflix if they have it.
B0018J2QB8|5.0|One of the best seasons of Dexter and personally in my opinion one of the best seasons of television ever produced, hopefully season 8 will be better.
030758836X|4.0|I seldom read contemporary thrillers, but \\"Gone Girl\\" intrigued me enough to give it a shot. I don't think it's destined to become a classic, and I understand why many readers didn't like it, but I enjoyed it.<br /><br />Middle-class midwestern boy Nick Dunne finds himself in way over his head with Amy Elliott, a New York City-bred trust-fund beauty four years his senior. Amy's fortune derives from a preachy tween-book series called \\"Amazing Amy\\" authored by her parents Rand and Marybeth Elliott.  Nick's a bright guy, but Amy is, as Nick would say, \\"f---- brilliant.\\" A couple of years into their marriage, Nick and Amy lose their New York magazine writer jobs. Against Amy's will, they move from Brooklyn to Nick's small Missouri hometown on the banks of the Mississippi River. There Nick cares for his aging parents and uses the last of Amy's trust fund to invest in a bar with his twin sister Margo. Amy meanwhile has too much time on her hands and finds it hard to fit in with the locals.  Amy doesn't like Missouri, and Nick doesn't like living with the unbearably perfect, always fault-finding Amy. One Sunday morning, Amy disappears. What happened? I'm not going to tell you. You can read reviews with spoilers if you want to find out without reading the book for yourself.<br /><br />Author Gillian Flynn, a former \\"Entertainment Weekly\\" staff writer, is keenly attuned to pop culture and today's media culture. These qualities give her story an engaging immediacy and afford her numerous opportunities for satiric humor, but also may make \\"Gone Girl\\" seem dated a few years hence. She writes alternately in Nick and Amy's first-person voices. She evinces a good feel for what's inside her characters' heads and handles dialogue convincingly. She obviously had great fun setting up her plot, and she's fair to the reader. I always hate mysteries where the detective announces that, based on information that has been withheld from the reader, a gardener mentioned in passing on page 17is the killer. (That's why I also liked Scott Turow's \\"Presumed Innocent\\"--when you reached the end, you could go back and say, \\"Oh, yeah, he gave us that piece of the puzzle.\\") She evokes the details of small-town life in the recession-ravaged Midwest nicely, and crafts her supporting cast with care. However, I sometimes tired of the hard-boiled tone. Overall, I would not rate it a stylistic masterpiece, but it's more than competent.<br /><br />You should not read \\"Gone Girl\\" if you can't enjoy a book that lacks a likable protagonist or a cleanly resolved ending, or that includes swear words and graphic sexual descriptions. None of these things bother me, so I enjoyed the smart plot and astute cultural commentary of \\"Gone Girl.\\"
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|Nothing like the book but overall an ok movie . Slow at first but picked up toward the ends acting was good
0345522478|1.0|Many people here wrote that they never write reviews but they had to just to tell readers that this book is awful (and the reviews and stars tell different)... well count me in... I don't write reviews but this book is absolutely awful and I had to tell about it cause I wasted money and time, read 234 pages of the book and thought my God it only gets worse with every page....stay away from iron druid... people stay away!!
0486278077|3.0|I couldn't really get into this book because let's face it....it's Oscar Wilde. But still it got progressively better the more I read. The opening chapter makes you think he is gay btw
193700788X|2.0|I had mixed feelings about this book. The final book in the Sookie Stackhouse series, which I have been reading for years now, I expected it to be mind-blowing. It didn't turn about to be quite as mind-blowing as I'd hoped, but it wasn't terrible either. In this book, Sookie is arrested for a murder she didn't commit. The evidence against her is weak, though, and she makes bail. Between her arrest and the state of her relationship with Eric, Sookie is going through some hard times. [Spoilers Ahead!] I knew all along that Sookie probably wouldn't end up with Eric. She is a sun-loving girl who has said multiple times that she didn't want to become a vampire. I didn't expect that to change. I also knew that she would probably end up with Sam. There was plenty of foreshadowing to lead up to that. He has been in love with her all along and he has always been the one there for her when everyone else had ulterior motives. So I was happy with that outcome. On the other hand, I was disappointed with how things worked out for Eric. I knew Sookie wouldn't end up with him, but I felt that he deserved better than what he got. He didn't deserve to have to follow through with the contract with the Queen. Then the author tried to make it look like he wanted to marry her for his own selfish reasons, thinking he would gain power from the arrangement. I didn't feel that that was fair or completely true to who Eric was as a character. Sure, he was manipulative, self-serving, and calculating. But I thought it was proved time and time again in the series that he had genuine feelings for Sookie and was doing whatever he could to get out of that arrangement.<br />I also felt that the way Sookie was portrayed in this book was unnecessary. She was always such a nice and caring person, and she seems to have hardened considerably in this book. I guess I think that some more time could have been taken on this book.

B005URRCUY|5.0|Awesome music!  I love listening to it in the morning on my way to work.  I revs me up for the day!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|its a fun game! I like it a lot. It does freeze sometimes. and the waiting sucks. over than that its good
B00BJ9VBLI|1.0|I deleted this game because it would just stop in the middle of playing. Why does this happen? Thank the Lord it was Free.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Great book! Keep you thinking ahead as to how things will come together.  Nothing stays in the past forever.  Great Cold Case story
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Not a fun game because you really have to use your own money to really play it. That's not a FREE game.
B00CATSONE|3.0|Since it's a free book from Amazon/Kindle, I can't complain about the price. The Tesla story itself is quite good, but the book suffers from too much 'discover your inner genius' hype, which is the subject of another of the author's books. Tesla himself was amazing and the story was well told as such. I also learned just what a scumbag J. P. Morgan was. Skip the intro and it's a good quick, free read.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|to play you have to have a face book account.  I do not!<br />I thought it was another version of game with maybe some new characters &#34;friends&#34;.
B009KWU6Q2|5.0|Anyone who is a kid at heart...(including kids).. will love this movie.  Dustin Hoffman plays a perfectly mean and nasty HOOK to Robin Williams grown-up Pan.  Great Family movie!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great game, but it is very easy to play it for a long time and not notice.
B005NFJAT4|5.0|I love this movie!! One of the best Gettysburg battle movies you will ever see. Very factual. Looks great in bluray
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|My Wife & I laughed from start to finish! Maybe those people who didn't like this film are afraid of the F word or aren't old enough to have lived yet. We Loved it! Thanks Bill
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|could do without the other game suggestions and facebook crap. other than that its a good time killer. oh well.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Simply amazing. John Green is a simply amazing writer. I read this book in about 3 hours because I literally could not stop. Phenomenal.
B00CFITJKW|3.0|Well, it needs a lot of work but I would suspect that the developer will be doing that. Try to update it to something like<br /> X-plane Hdef.<br />Better controls<br />(Being able to use tilt on kindle for movement)
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have this game on the pc and it rocks. This is amazing as well. The only bad part is limited world area but it doesn't matter. I highly suggest this app.
1595825045|5.0|If you love the behind the scenes stuff and the process of a show making this have to be in your library, fan or not.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I downloaded this for my youngest son but I've taken it over..I really like this game..it's fun. My husband has even gotten into it.
B008MM9630|3.0|So far seems fun. Child easy, my kids will probably play it more than anything. Especially if it can be played off-line.
B009AMAGQM|1.0|This movie is fake i thought this would be good but i was wrong. Nothing can out do the twilight saga
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|This game had potential to be great but it takes forever to get anywhere! So if you enjoy plants and coral that take all day to grow, go on and download.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Wonderful end to the Sookie Stackhouse. series. I'll miss Sookie and looking forward to the next  book. Good way to say goodbye

B00BZOFUI2|5.0|This is the album I've been waiting to be released as the rightful follow-up to 1994's Purpendicular. The first album to include Steve Morse following Ritchie Blackmores retirement from the band, Purpendicular was a fine integration of Steve's style of playing with Deep Purples established musical style. In my ears, it just worked, and it sounded like the logical advancement of musical progression by the band. There was exciement in the writing and in the performance, and that excitement showed in concert, as demonstrated on the 1996 release \\"Live at the Olympia\\". This was still a band with much to offer.<br /><br />I just wasn't as enthused about Abandon, Bananas or Rapture as they were released. Though there was nice work on each album, those recordings just didn't grab my attention. NOW WHAT remedies the disappointment I felt in the previous releases. Between the songs \\"A Simple Song\\" to \\"Vincent Price\\", you get to hear a band showing why they have the reputation as fine players and writers. I don't know how much of this came as a result of producer Bob Ezrin guiding the band to this end, but the result is flawless. I'd be willing to consider this a perfect album. Much the way Machine Head was a perfect album, where you just wanted to hear every song on the album, Now What offers the same continuity. I have no urge to press next track while listening. This is not the 1970s Deep Purple. And thatfs not a bad thing. They arenft eating themselves by rehashing their past. This is Deep Purple for the Twenty-teens, with nods to their history, such as the RONDO section of Hell to Pay. And that is a good thing. As a nice bonus, there is a deluxe release of NOW WHAT which features the bonus track \\"It'll Be Me\\". A nice barrel-house rocker.[[ASIN:B00BZOFUI2 Now What ?!]]
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Cool game... I love how u can do so many things.... its like taking care of a real horse.  Even though its easy to press the button to do what u want, but I do wish u could actually do the horse care stuff instead of just pressing the button and it takes energy away.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|The case does appear to hold the kindle upside down, but that is so minor that it's hardly worth mentioning.  Overall, the case is everything the seller says it is.  Oh, I haven't dropped it (hopefully, never will) so I have no idea how it protects during a fall but it seems like it could take a bump or two.  It's nice enough and is definitely worth the price, to me!
1423113454|2.0|I cheeked this book out of my local library, all excited because it was about Egypt.  I love the tales of Ancient Egypt.  I have read Mr. Riordan's Percy Jackson books, and I had expected something along the same lines- great characters, lots of hummer, and plenty of joking references to old myths and new movies.  NOT at all what I got.  What I did get was a kinda creepy book about two siblings who don't get along, not able to find who to trust and being possessed by 'gods', with a slowly progressing plot.  The two main characters are possessed by the Egyptian deities Isis and Horus.  There father has been sucked into a coffin, and possessed by Osiris.  I find this kind of disturbing.  It is also rife with secret societies for magicians (ok, so there is only one, but it is world wide.). This book lacks all (or at least, most of) the humor and fast pace that made the Percy Jackson books so amazing.  Mr. Riordan's Percy books kept me laughing the whole way through.  This book was dry, disturbing, and just not what I have come to expect of Mr. Riordan.  I could not even finish the book.  I did like how he kept his Percy books intact by having the characters stay away from Manhattan, and mt. Olympus.  All in all, I would recommend reading Elizabeth Peters books or a good text book on Egypt before I would recommend this book.
B004NELBPC|1.0|I agree with other reviewers that the current update for Kindle Fire is terrible.  You can't enlarge the tiny font and there is almost no content available.  They ruined what used to be a pretty good app.
125000098X|2.0|Really enjoyed the first two books and the first half of this one.  However, the second half feels like it was written by a different (inferior author).  Felt like he just ran out of material so created this goofy Argentine smuggling story which is so implausible that it is actually funny instead of dramatic.  Kind of reminds me of the sitcoms in the 80's and 90's where they would have the family take a cruise or go to Paris because they ran out of material.  Can only hope the next book is up to Archer's standards
0312430000|5.0|I had to buy this for class, but I really enjoyed reading it. It's well-written and really puts an interesting spin on something so simple, checklists.<br /><br />I'd recommend reading this if you're interested in Medicine, architecture, restaurants, basically any profession that has benefited from the use of checklists.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Thhe author was able to cleverly capture real life human situations through the eyes of dog, while simultaneously applying the lessons learnt from a race car driver racing in the rain to threat with everyday challenges of life.
0385349947|3.0|As a woman in a male-dominated field (law), I wanted to get Ms. Sandberg's perspective on what I can do to improve my position in my career.  She is obviously quite successful at what she has chosen to do with her life, so I thought there would be no harm in reading her advice.<br /><br />There was no harm, but there wasn't a great deal of help either.  Much of what she has suggested, basically to stop all the worrying and lunge at what you want to achieve, isn't that different from what others have suggested.  When I started in my profession, I looked to the people who were most successful, without regard to gender, and decided what skills I would hone to achieve a high level of success.  Ms. Sandberg gives similar advice, but couched in more sexists terms.  She suggests that we quit acting like women and start acting like men, and I find that to be a very divisive suggestion.<br /><br />Neither women nor men fit neatly into a specific mold.  We should not be fitting people to stereotypes, nor should we be clamoring for equal representation in all aspects of life.  We should have professions and hobbies based upon our interests and our skills, not upon some magical gender-based ratio determined by society.  You should not fight sexism with sexism.  Teach PEOPLE to value themselves, to value their contributions, and to find the things in life that fulfill them.  Hire and promote PEOPLE according to their skills and talents.  When we start viewing each other as PEOPLE rather than in divided groups based on gender or any other quality, then we are really getting rid of sexism.
B005K17RU0|3.0|I loved this app BEFORE you updated it...now its too complicated. Is there any way to get the previous version?
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Both games are very fun and look pretty good for remasters. I still can't believe I got them both for under $20.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Funny game for all family very good and nice graphics altamente recomendable para todo till de jugadores banquet se vuelve un loco repetido en un momentous dado
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Although a very obvious end, the way the narrative is as crazy as the characters' minds makes it a very intense and not-linear movie.<br />Don't watch it if you are looking for a traditional love story, because there's more behind it than just finding love and being happily ever after.
B0051GY0LS|4.0|I enjoyed the story and it was well constructed. The story keeps you interested and it's a good follow on from the previous book with the same Title.
B004I1WIWU|1.0|Maybe I should say the album 'cupped'. None of my other albums are like this so I assume it's this particular manufacturer that's to blame. It sounds great even if misshaped. It's not worth 20 bucks to me to bother with a return but I won't be buying vinyl on Amazon again.
B006M4F67A|3.0|Fun game for free. Not a lot of game board options. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a game to pass the time.
B00000AOUD|4.0|The item took too much time to arrive to its final destination. This was unusual for me. I contacted the seller and explained my worries about it. The seller was polite and courteous in his explanations. He even sent me a second copy which I finally received. This second copy arrived in good condition. I played the CD and there is nothing wrong with it.<br />The first copy got lost somewhere. However, I feel the seller response was very prompt and he always tried to help me out by which I am very satisfied.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Our whole family loves this movie. It is a genuine family movies for old and young alike with amazing animation and cute characters which speaks to the love of a family, no matter how you define it!
B0054N73EY|4.0|I received this item in good condition. It came wrapped in shrink wrap as it was described. I played the CD and there is nothing wrong with it. I am very happy with this purchase.
B007QDNKQA|3.0|I started watching this but stopped about 30 minutes in.  Mark Wahlberg is very good but this was slow starting and seemed to be very predictable.  I would not recommend this one.
0345525558|5.0|unusual and intriguing......this book pulled me in and kept a strangle-hold on my imagination.  Never predictable, always satisfying with characters like no other.
B0094MFITS|5.0|I wish that ALL the stories in this series were on Amazon Prime.  The four that are there now are all terrific.  Tom Selleck is the MAN!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I am not a big fan of mysteries but this is a great read. It kept me entertained and engaged. I will seek out more books by this author.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|The book was so much better than movie. The movie was a flop to me. If u read the book you will get so many  more details.
1616550414|5.0|Pretty much the highlight of my gaming memorabilia collection!!<br />This was a much anticipated release and I am overjoyed to have it!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Shows what any family can face! Even if your father is the DA. You will understand once you read the book
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I am an English teacher, so it would be safe to say that I am a voracious reader. It is hard to find a book that is perfectly satisfying in every way but Silver Linings Playbook is that rare book! The characters are richly developed and flawed. You will find yourself rooting for the protangonist, Pat, through his entire journey. His parents are deeply human and perfectly frustrating. The timing of events in the storyline is just right. If you are like me and always looking for an ending that is deep and satisfying and exactly right, you will love this book!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is an epic game with lots to do. I played it for 2 days straight. I highly recommend it to anyone who is thinking about getting it.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|when I got this u thought it would be stupid then I played a couple times and I loved it best game eva. so awesome you have to play it
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This sharpner is a very handy tool.  I cary with me every where and sharp my friends cooking knife in secs.  I love it.
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|Well Mr. Cline certainly has encyclopedic knowledge of the origins of gaming and the largely forgettable eighties.<br />As in The Hunger Games, the protagonist faces impossible odds and must use his wits and gaming skill to prevail.  The setting is in the US in the year 2045 and the Great Recession of 2011-12 has not abated.  Wade has been raised by his game console via a Sesame Street type program, then his virtual school.<br />You can just taste the bitter metallic harshness of life for a boy with no human interaction.<br />Although it was rather predictable, it did serve as a clarion call to those who find more life in the virtual world than in the physical one...
B006LSZECO|5.0|Could not put it down!  This is a great mystery with a lot of elements to keep the reader hooked.  As a grammar fanatic I loved the little comments by the wife about use of \\"me\\" and \\"I\\".  (Thank you Gilliam Flynn for trying to set people straight on that issue.) Believe the number of reviewers who said this is a great book.  If you like a cliff hangar then this book is for you.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|Tommy Lee Jones does not know how to act badly. Yes, this film was no Lonesome Dove, but it was a really fine movie and the story was very much worth it. It is a friendship movie and that was good enough for me.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|This is a stunning example of vocally-driven pop and a great comeback from Agnetha. Agnetha's voice can make a dictionary sound like wonderful.  Here she is helped by a great collection of pop songs which showcase her voice and her ability to convey the realm of human emotions and moods and touch the listener. The album contains many styles and moods; it is both soothing and uplifting, melancholic and melodic. There's the drama of Past Forever and I Was a Flower, the 60's flavoured Bubble, the dreaminess of Perfume in the Breeze, the disco stomper Dance the Pain Away which is completely infectious, and the lush, contemporary ballad When You Loved Someone. I Keep Them On the Floor Beside My Bed composed by Agnetha is an interesting mix of piano-driven melody, country chorus and orchestral backing. Deserves to be a huge hit.
0788859544|1.0|DVD had deep scratches in it. Was described as new. As soon as I loaded DVD it would not play I tried cleaning DVD reloaded an it skipped an paused at very beginning NEVER moving from the scene!  Kids were crying the thought they were going to watch an old classic movie!
1475143389|5.0|I've read many, many fitness books and magazines but this one by Michael Matthews is one of the best.  Have only recently discovered it but have really enjoyed not only his knowledge, but also the no nonsense way he conveys it. He cuts through the flannel and the hype and delivers what he feels the most important fitness principles. And all in a gentlemanly manner!<br /><br />As for the exercise principles they work!  My workouts so far using his methods have been intensive beyond compare - I know this because my muscles have never been so sore (but in a good way). I never felt in the past I'd worked my legs enough despite doing endless squats etc but since using Michael's methods, I can feel my legs when I walk so something has definitely shifted. My arms from this week are still recovering and it's been four days.<br /><br />His thoughts on supplements are very useful and two products I purchased as a result of his recommendations I think are going to make quite a difference. Check out his Shredded Chef book too as it provides some good recipes to support the fitness journey. No more cutting out recipes endlessly from magazines, it's all in one book.
0525953728|5.0|A great and very interesting read about the behind the scenes planning and bravery of the seal team six members. Different story if comparing it to the movie on the same subject. I Highly recommend this book.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I love the artwork, the different levels, and the option to play with no pressure.  The music is not as relaxing as Fallen Tree games such as Quell, but it is not too annoying.  On Kindle Fire HD I can even screen capture my favorites.  It makes me want to visit the Quilt museum in Paducah Kentucky.
0385535147|5.0|If you like the John Grisham books, you will absolutely love this thriller..It was very difficult to put it down once I got &#34;into&#34; the story. I would highly recommend this book.
B00CL0J99K|1.0|At first the movie looked good... but one of the best, most notable Iron Man enemies, The Mandarin was just some drunk hobo being paid to take all blame for terrorist attacks organized by A.I.M. Worst. Plot. Ever. Any real Iron Man fan will hate this movie.
B007WEQ3K8|5.0|Was looking for a App that would keep me thinking,would say to Anyone my<br />age check this one out everything here is fun and challenging
B00CELB980|5.0|\\"Soothe My Soul\\" is my 2nd favorite song on the Delta Machine cd, so I was pleased to see that there were 6 remixes available on the cd I ordered. (My first favorite on Delta M? \\"Should Be Higher\\", of course. Dave, where'd you get them high notes, dude? Fun!) I am listening to these remixes and don't get the complaints AT ALL. Must be blasphemous rumours. I am doing some butt-wigglin' here that would give Mr. Gahan a run for his money! Well, you know what they say, hater's gonna hate. Me? Any second now I'm going to get the balance right cuz I just can't get enough! Peace.

B006M4F67A|4.0|This game has several levels of difficulty.  I got this game 3 days ago and find myself playing the game every time I have a few minutes of free time.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Not as great as the first, but I defiantly enjoyed it and will be reading the next book in the series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Haven't seen the movie yet, but very very happy that I could relate the characters to their movie cast. Can't wait to start the next one!
B00684J49U|5.0|Normally I dont like shows like this, But the actors are so good in this,  I love it Cant wait till next season.
1402573723|5.0|Good for english course my son found it helpful with his school work and understanding the book better it was beneficial for the class
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|My husband usually only wants to watch action movies, but I got him to sit down and watch this movie.  He thoroughly enjoyed it.  It had some drama, some comedy and some romance; something for everyone.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I love this addictive fun game!!!!!!! I was introduced to this game about an hour ago and still can't put down my kindle to sleep
B0070Y46UY|2.0|Just not a lot of action to keep me interested. I felt it was a very slow read for me.
B00AAQWMB4|3.0|I start the game it flashed something on the screen as I looked looked up at the time and apparently missed the tutorial. Guess it assumes we all know how to play and doesn't feel the need to teach us. After a few minutes I figured out what to do but this game moves way too quick and needs to slow it down for the newbies.  Very user unfriendly but given time could be learned and possibly enjoyable.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|The Tudors is historical fiction at its finest.  It is exciting and well acted and the costumes and sets--awesome!  I highly recommend it for a rainy afternoon with a cup of tea and perhaps a scone or two.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|One of their best Albums.  Also, the tour is great.  These guys are timeless!!!  Hopefully they can keep this going for awhile longer.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|This is a niche product, of course, but if you need it then you need it. It fits perfectly and does its job.
B007N5YIUS|2.0|I cant rate this game since it keeps giving me an error on the app. unable to open the game to play.
B00AAQWMB4|4.0|Having read the other reviews I fumbled around thinking there weren't instructions. One reviewer noted having accidentally figured out that you can flip with a long press. That helped, but there was still no way I could win a round. During play I figured out that you can rotate the piece using the small circles in the north, east, south, &amp; west quadrants of the large grey circle around your piece in play. Between the long press to flip &amp; the points to rotate with, you can position the piece however you want. That allowed me to win a round. (On the easy setting, after two more tries.)<br />I am only giving it 4 stars because the description says you can play against a friend. You can't. Not that I could figure out at least. If you choose not to play against 3 A.I. players, it defaults to a 4-person game. If the developer updates it so that the A.I. can cover one, two, or three players, it will be a 5-star game.<br />When I finished playing I went to the help section to be sure there wasn't something there I was missing in regards to playing against a friend. There I found full instructions on how to play. It's not written in perfect English but it's complete and coherent. So disregard all the reviews saying they didn't give full rating because it lacks a tutorial. They just didn't look for it.<br />If the game sounds like your cup of tea, and you're fine with A.I. or 4-players only, I recommend it.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I can't rate this game since we cant open this game.  We keep getting error about app an error on the screen.
B00AIBZLVY|4.0|I loved this movie. After seeing the mediocre remake of Evil Dead this was a great redemption for my horror movie day.  The acting is great, the sparsely used special effects lend to the taut eeriness of the films atmosphere. Mama just wants what most parents want - unquestioning, unhindered love and devotion. The problem is the kids she wants it from are not hers and she isn't exactly human. Kudos to the youngest girl, Isabelle Nélisse, for her performance. She showed such raw emotion you wonder if the movie will have an affect on her.
034580404X|5.0|I started this trilogy a week ago and I could not put them down. I have never been so consumed with a book in my whole life. To me it is great writing and a wonderful story. Now that I'm done I feel lost. They are truly great books, you need to read them. Please, please hurry and write number 4.
B004SKLD9A|1.0|I like the movie a lot BUT as of may 16, 2013 Amazon has the movie for $99.00? Where are u people coming up with these prices???

1452101248|5.0|This cookbook met and exceeded expectations. Beautiful photos, inventive, exotic flavors, and recipes that never disappoint, all using vegetables and other ingredients that are generally available, though maybe not already in your pantry. Though it's a bit advanced for all but the most adventurous beginner cook, intermediate and advanced cooks will be fine.<br /><br />Written by Israeli-born Yotam Ottolenghi, a restaurateur in London, the flavors in these recipes are unique and unexpected, but never disappointing. Ottolenghi has created recipes where the vegetables and other ingredients shine and satisfy. Though I never thought I'd say this, when I'm eating them, I don't even miss the meat.<br /><br />Contrary to some of the other reviews, which are clearly for the UK version, the US version of this cookbook lists measurements in cups, ounces, tablespoons, etc, as is standard here. The recipes vary in difficulty and time, but the uncommon combinations of ingredients and flavors make even the simplest of recipes stand out.<br /><br />This cookbook is divided into sections based on the star ingredient. Chapters are: Roots, Funny Onions, Mushrooms, Zucchini and Other Squashes, Peppers, Brassicas, The Mighty Eggplant, Tomatoes, Leaves, Green Things (cucumber, artichoke, asparagus, okra), Green Beans, Pulses (legumes), Grains, Pasta/Polenta/Couscous, and Fruit with Cheese.<br /><br />Some favorites:<br /><br />Roasted parsnips and sweet potatoes with caper vinaigrette<br />Caramelized garlic tart<br />Very full tart (filled with roasted peppers, eggplant, sweet potato, zucchini, tomato, ricotta, & feta)<br />Soba noodles with eggplant and mango<br />Quinoa and grilled sourdough salad (a type of panzanella)<br />The ultimate winter couscous (with carrots, parsnips, apricots, chickpeas)<br />Figs with basil, goat cheese and pomegranate vinaigrette<br /><br />If you're looking for a new way to feature vegetables in your cooking or to experiment with Middle Eastern flavors,definitely give this one a try.
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|Love this movie - got here quickly - a really fun one!  Definately a movie classic for all ages - I'd buy it again!

B009KS4XRO|5.0|I enjoyed bingo blitz on my Kindle fire until the credits are taken for no reason, and purchases are not credited. I was told over a week ago that credits I purchased were added, they were not. I understand it is a free game, but I have learned not to spend my money on this game.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is an amazingly fun, challenging game. I really enjoy playing it. I always wanted to get it on my iPhone but it won't play in the 4s. I'm so happy android has it now.

B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I AM USING THE FREE VERSION right now. I ONLY WISH IT HAD THE PERSONAL MUSIC OPTION FOR FREE. I use another free app when I am in a music kind of mood. I HAVE TO SAY THIS is the only app I have used that consistently works as it should. And it displays on my opening page. I DO NOT individually to actually see the time.HAVE TO OPEN IT,  SO Thumbs up it is!
B000HX4ZF6|5.0|I have seen this movie as a teenager years ago. Can't quite understand and appreciate this masterpiece. Now I'm so touched and will definitely regard this movie as the best of its kind.
B004OR199G|5.0|I have read every diet book known to man kind thank you for reminding that my health is invaluable.  Thank you for showing me the way to feeling and looking better.  Thank you for giving me hope.  Awesome
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I  enjoyed this game for a while bet the levels seemed to get a bit repetative. Still a good game and worth the money.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This movie created quite a stir at the theater, so when I saw it on Prime, I had to watch.  The plot and performance were riveting.  Best sci fi type film I've seen in a long time.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I have other games for my cousins... but this was and has been the only game they seem to play. They try to get me to buy them they algae but I guess that's the only pet peeve. other than that I give it a thumbs up.
0385344333|1.0|Ever since Lee Child &#34;sold out&#34; for big money for the movie rights to his books (Read:  5'4&#34; Tomcat Cruise as 6'5&#34; 250 pound Jack Reacher?????) his writing has gotten so bad.<br /><br />Boring, boring book.  And his comments regarding US Army members as basically dumber than sacks of hair (except of course for military police) are just horrendous.  This Brit, Lee Child, (not his real name) has the AUDACITY to rip our military when he never served even ONE day in ANY military service.  Pages and pages and pages of number games, statistics (Who cares what the area code and population of Kansas City are?  Anyone?  Anyone?)<br /><br />Child is just phoning it in!  I cancelled his book coming out in September, 2013.  No more.<br /><br />Child didn't even seem to know that because of environmental concerns McDonald's quit using &#34;clamshells&#34; for their sandwiches in 1990!  I guess since he became a multi-millionaire off his books he doesn't eat at McDonald's anymore either.  Jack Reacher used to be a great book character...too bad that Child forgot how to write.  I actually quit reading I was so bored.  Gave it to my local library.
B000TRXRUY|5.0|If only he would have lived. He would have easily been the biggest star in Hollywood. Had he chosen to make more flicks of course. This is by far his best. The fight scene in the underground bunker is my fave.
159562015X|5.0|Worked through the book and assessment for business.  Bought a book for each of my three children + their spouses.  Just wish I'd have known this earlier in my career.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Basically this is an updated version of Goldratt's \\"The Goal\\" applied to IT operations but it's very well done and provides some helpful (and unique) insights into how to use constraint-based thinking in an IT context. Every IT Director should give his VP a copy.
B00BF123WG|4.0|Overall, this is a great movie.  It creeps along in the beginning and middle, settnig the stage for a brilliant 3rd act.  Enjoyed it immensely.  Just remember when you're bored... it gets better.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I just love having the ability to read and sync books over multiple platforms. Android, iPad, computer, it just doesn't matter.
B0091REZMW|5.0|love it a lot me and my stepmom play it. I love it bunches. love peace Mystery MANOR! its so kool
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent read. It kept my attention the whole way.<br />It brought me to the edge of my seat and back.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is great! Love the graphics and the puzzles, but WAY too short. I want more. I would definitely be willing to pay more if it were longer.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The appeal of Suzanne Collins' Hunger Games trilogy is striking in both prose and storytelling, across all demographics.  To some degree, a coming of age story of a teenaged girl, but lessons and values imparted are subtle and others will take additional reflection.  I have to admit I enjoyed this series far more than I expected to.
1609611543|5.0|This is a very informative book on health problems relating to eating too much wheat and goes along with the Wheat Belly Cookbook..<br />I would recommend to this book.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|This movie is a great stress-reliever.  It pretty much follows the action/ adventure format, but it's not fingernails-embedded-in-the palm intense, either.  I wouldn't go so far as to say this is a children's or a family film, but it does seem appropriate for teens or maybe even tweens.  At least this grandmother was able to handle it and even to enjoy it.  Of course the plot is not perfectly believable, but if you're in the mood for something in the superhero-type realm, this is for you.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|I enjoyed the movie. It got a little slow here and there, but it was ok. It wasn't too cheesy
B00BI745AA|4.0|If you've never seen Les Miserables in any form, then please, watch this movie.  This is an epic human story that you have to see at least once in your life.  This movie conveys the story well, and you should enjoy watching some of your favorite actors in a high-budget film.<br /><br />Now, for those of you who are Les Miserables gourmets, there are certainly things in this version that fall far short of perfection -- especially musically.  If you are a singer or a musician, please don't watch this!  You might experience physical pain as you listen to the marginal singers.  Russell Crowe, as Javert, was a particular disappointment; Cosette and Marius duets often bordered on laughable; and the innkeepers' scenes were abrasive.<br /><br />If, however, you aren't so musically picky, you might want to give this incarnation of Victor Hugo's novel a chance.  Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway portrayed ValJean and Fontine with their whole heart and soul.  While I'm not 100% endorsing this film, I am 100% in approval of Anne Hathaway's Best Actress award.  One cannot view her performance with apathy.  I felt that I was watching movie history when I viewed her scenes.  It wasn't over-the-top; it wasn't over-acting; it didn't feel like she was trying to win an Oscar.  It just felt absolutely right.<br /><br />While the singing is weak in spots, the acting, the story, and the overall scope of the film are all wonderful.  These are the reasons for the four-star-rating.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I can't wait to see what is going to happen!!  I'm as hooked as I was to lost..  I love the back and forth between storybrook and their past history it reminds me of how they did it on lost!!!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I have a son who's bipolar, two nieces with schizophrenia, and a class full of students on mood-altering drugs.  Of course I loved this movie.  Even if everybody you know is &#34;normal&#34;, though, I think you'll find something to love about this movie, too.<br /><br />The writing and acting were excellent and the actors pulled off the difficult task of being at once deadly serious yet laced with humor.  In fact, that's the point of the whole movie.  Life is serious.  Life is hard.  Life is filled with struggles that threaten to drag us down.  Relationships are impossible.  Given that life and relationships are like this, what can we do?  We go about looking for silver linings.  What more could you ask for?
B00A81NFAS|5.0|This was an amazing film, the arguments to the dialogue all kept me interested and wanting to continue to see what would happen. Recommend it!
B006M4F67A|5.0|This game is easy to learn but challenging enough to keep you occupied for hours. I really liked the different levels and the way it tracks time spent. A great Majong game for the Kindle.
B000P0J0AG|5.0|I searched and searched and could not find this movie on cable or netflix so I had to breakdown and buy it.<br />For some reason, to me this has the greatest gun fight scene.  It's so loud and explosive and has you rooting for the bad guys.  I think I have seen this movie (or at least the gun fight scene) about 20 times since I've purchased.  I just wonder why I waited so long to buy it.  If you haven't seen it, it is A MUST!!!!!!!!  You will not be disappointed!
B007EE564U|4.0|Always moving ...couldn't stop reading it. Just wish this author could write a bit quicker so I can read the next one!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|It's just like the twitter you would find on the OS devices or android powered devices. I absolutely love twitter, more than facebook actually. Good app(:<br /><br />Follow me; @YMCMB_60
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Was sad but it was cute says Sam.  This is the most touching book I have read in some time.  Truly beautiful.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Great App. It's Like A Texting App, But More Simplified Because You Don't Need A Phone Number Or All That Stuff. Just A Username And You're Ready To Go(:
B00992CF6W|5.0|was really fun but it isn't as upgraded as the computer or xbox but still fun also minecraft is super sweet
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love facebook, indeed I do. But the only problem with this facebook for the kindle edition, is that it does not update like on android or iOS powered devices. It does not have chatheads or any of those cool things. Just normal facebook which is really dissapointing but, it's good.
B009NY43NY|4.0|With so many negative reviews online I started the book expecting the worst (did she really slaughter the finale??) and was relieved to find this book did not disappoint. If you've been a faithful reader of this series you will find little to no difference between the quality of this book and the preceding ones. The story eventually had to end (as all do) and Charlene chose the path that made the most sense for her characters and tied up all the loose ends with a big fat bow. Thank Charlene for many hours of enjoyment through the years where I found myself lost in the awesome world Sookie!
B004SBX112|5.0|I love angry birds seasons it has more levels then any other angry birds game.  I love the new magic update ! Buy this game!  LONG LIVE ROVIO! LONG LIVE ANGRY BIRDS!!!!!!!!
B002PMPTIO|5.0|Not as good as the orininal Kirk but still good. Spock was awesome too. Not sure i want to see the second one yet though if Spock is not in it
B000JMKRKC|5.0|First read this novel about seven years ago. So glad to revisit its pages. I was totally drawn into the characters lives.Loved how the story moves back and forth in time. Well written and beautifully crafted.
B000025XKM|5.0|One thing that annoys me when I read reviews of the album is that people are always talking about how it was Nick Drake's last gasp before he succumbed to blackness, or how the songs have such an aura of desperation about them. Maybe so, but I feel like that distracts from the musicality of the album. And really it doesn't feel like blackness to me (like for instance Bonnie Prince Billy's \\"I See a Darkness\\" does). It feels like that beautiful, still moment as the sun is rising and nothing is moving yet. It feels like someone is speaking sincerely, directly to you. And the album is awfully beautiful and *sweet* for something that's supposed to be so depressing.<br /><br />I read that Pink Moon was recorded in two nights, taking a total of four hours to record. All first takes. The whole thing is live, with the exception of the piano part on the title track. (And that piano part is so beautiful!) That is amazing to me.<br /><br />This is one of the few truly timeless albums of the last 50 years.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|There is a lot of truth in this one DVD.  It explains how we arrived in this financial mess, how families lost their home and their jobs, and most of their money. All this happening while the &#34;Fat Cats&#34;(Or the 1%) got richer and poor or middle class got poorer.  I fail to believe that the government and people in power in this country do not know these facts.  I fail to understand how they can get up in the morning and start their day, continuing to fleece the rest of the country(or the 99%).  Buy It, you will be amazed by what the leaders of USA have allowed to happen.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I think this game shows potential from your brain's imagination and shows your talent of creativity. That is why I rated this game (app) five stars out of five.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I live in the NW where the weather always seems to be changing and I would try to watch the local news to get the weather report and would more than not miss the report. This app. lets me check on my local city weather anytime I want and makes a great forecast for when I have to travel or work outside. And you can't beat the price, free!
B008602KQI|5.0|The quality of this movie was excellent. It was a perfect teat, for a relaxing night at home. Highly recommend it!
B0027MJU00|5.0|This has the suspense of other novels by Gillian Flynn.  The reader is kept guessing until the very end.  It also speaks to family relationships and how dysfunction in the family unit leads to dysfunction for all its members. if one loved &#34;Gone Girl&#34; by this author, they will also love this book.  A real page turner.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game!  It does have a lot of glitches and can be quite buggy but very fun to play!
B005NKGEP2|3.0|It will keep the reader guessing and for those who enjoy intrigue, it will be a good read.  We read it for book club. Some liked  the intrigue.  Some felt the plot difficult to follow.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed season 2!  I laughed and even shed a few tears as the story progressed.  Excellent, quality filmmaking!!
B005MMZ63C|5.0|The movie quality goes without saying. The stream quality also excellent. A great value and really a must watch film.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I have read all of the sookie Stackhouse novels...the last 3 seemed to lack the talent of the previous ones. When I read the second to last one I thought maybe it was the one before it was just one of those things, they can't all be the same caliber. However if you are/were a die hard fan you may be sorely disappointed. The way that Charlaine Harris was able to blend so many species and yet show there differences/similarities to humanity was truly a work of art. I really enjoyed them. Unfortunately this was all lost on the last one. In it you will find that you &#34;can't trust anyone different from yourself&#34;.<br /><br />When I read the first book I thought &#34;Oh no she is going to pair Sookie with...&#34; But then she kept going in another direction. However in the end this is exactly who she ended up with. Yes he is different but somehow this doesn't come across in the book.<br /><br />Even people who have been her friend, though they were other were now people not to trust. Even though many of these friends came through out the book...they were still not to be trusted because they were &#34;other.&#34; Maybe Charlene missed her calling and should start writing for some militant racial group that hates anyone different from themselves! I am truly disappointed and sadden by this last book. I personally will not by another book by this woman, between the babble and the prejudice that shines through it was a waste of time and money to make this purchase. I should have stopped 3 books ago and then I could of continued to think she was something special.
B009O2XY12|5.0|Love these kind of games and it also comes in handy for the grandkids!  It's convenient and fun! A must have.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|This is a great app for playing all formats of videos we have tried so far. I have found no issue yet.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|I haven't really gotten into this one much.  I liked what I saw when I got it but I've been too busy reading books on my Kindle to play with it!  Love my Kindle!!!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|The finding nemo game is so fun I just wish you got more free pearls . Kids definitely love this game it is a learning experience and visually beautiful
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|The concept of this moving is great! The ending is a little odd but still worth it. The visuals of the town makes you really wonder what is going on in the mind of the creator!
B008JDAC7G|5.0|Very addictive and fun, this game will make it to the 5 or so games that I actually keep playing
B004OC07N0|1.0|Written in an uninteresting style. Full of generic suggestions that most of us already know. There is hardly any value adding suggestions.
B001R0LOES|3.0|while the images and story( as far as I could ascertain) were interesting  I could perhaps have rated it higher but it needed closed captions to follow the dialogue.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Do your habits control You? To many of you, this question may be easy to answer with a resounding, \\"No, my habits don't control me. I control them and can stop or change my habits whenever I want.\\" In his book, The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business, Charles Duhigg - an award-winning New York Times business reporter - explores the \\"scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed (Amazon Summary).\\" He also delves into how much habits actually do control our thoughts, feelings, and actions and offers insightful suggestions on how we can change our bad habit loops into good habit loops.<br /><br />In my honest opinion, I give The Power of Habit 5 stars out of 5. The stories that Duhigg relates in the book are both entertaining and inspiring. His hypotheses are validated through the scientific research given for each story as well. Some will say that Duhigg fails to offer exactly how to change our bad habits into good ones. I beg to differ because each one of us have different habits. His description of the habit loop - the cue, the routine, the reward - is sufficient enough. By changing the cues and rewards of our habits, we will dramatically change our routines in a positive manner.<br /><br />Shaun Messick<br />[[ASIN:B004Y5KQHO Worlds Without End: The Mission (Book 1)]]<br />[[ASIN:B00ABHZZI4 Worlds Without End: Aftermath (Book 2)]]
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Could hardly put the book down! Very well written. This is my kind of fantasy/dream. Keeps your toes curled, in a good kind of way...;-)
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|This was a LOL a page!  Tina Fey is a very good writer and tells a story in a way that we can picture the situation in our minds.  I enjoyed this book very much.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Having moved from the Central Coast of California to Ohio (that's another story ...), I deeply miss the ocean. This lets me hear the waves and I can go to sleep visualizing the coast, especially Point Pinos.
0307477479|4.0|I bought this in the airport and was pleasantly surprised.  Well written, good plot and character development.  Would recommend for sure.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Anyone can watch this program without worrying about bad scenes or suggestive language. At least from what I have seen so far.<br />Very realistic
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Quite a fun little puzzler, nice animations. Some puzzles redundant, but good variety overall. Only took me about 2 hours to complete, but was delightful. A little pricey given the short gameplay and no reason to replay, but very satisfied and hope to see more from this developer.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Adorable little time waster app. Is a very good app to keep a young girls attention. Take care of all kinds of cute little animals.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|We all enjoy playing the game. The little kids have as much fun getting the coins as the older ones getting new ponies.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I greatly enjoyed the first book in this series and found it difficult to put this book down.  A very worthwhile read.
B00992CF6W|1.0|It is nothing like the computer game it has no pets and all it has is stupid things. Minecraft pocket edition is the worst game ever.
B000W21ER4|5.0|I'd forgotten how good this album was. I had it on cd, loaned it to a friend about 10 years ago, and never got it back. I just picked it up again for $5 on Amazon and it takes me back to the 90's every time I listen to it.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Its a good game it has potential for alot more tho add a few more classes etc. But it is fun to play there is not much more to ask
B0089LOG02|5.0|A great read! I could not put it down. I loved the connections between the two stories. As I read this book I was struck by the  toughness of the human spirit.
B0042J6VUS|4.0|I got this so it could point at my face while playing video games and it works AMAZING! I love it!
B00846REIS|4.0|This was a very good read. It kept me turning the pages wondering what was going to happen next. I would recommend this book to any reader.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Great movie. The Sessions tells the true story of a man confined to an iron lung since he was 6 who at age 38 is determined to lose his virginity. With the help of his therapist and his priest, he sets out to make his dream a reality. This movie is very thought provoking, tender, and funny at the same time. The treatment of sex is candid and very straight forward. Warning, the movie has full frontal nudity, but done in a sensitive way.  I found the movie to be an absolute delight.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It is a fun game for every age. Easy to understand and play, keeps you interested with the different levels. Still haven't figured out how to get friends because mine is on a Kindle and all I have is my Facebook account.
B008JFUO72|4.0|Having saved the Earth with Marvel superhumans in \\"The Avengers,\\" a genius industrialist (and playboy) Tony Stark comes back in \\"Iron Man 3,\\" an action-packed movie of which story becomes pretty darker than the previous two \\"Iron Man\\" films. Maybe this is not surprising as the new installment is directed by Shane Black, writer of \\"Lethal Weapon.\\"<br /><br />\\"Iron Man 3\\" revolves around our billionaire superhero Tony Stark/Iron Man, who, while struggling with panic attacks, has to fight the armies led by a terrorist called the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley). Guy Pearce plays Aldrich Killian, a scientist Tony Stark should have treated better.<br /><br />This is a film that will divide opinion between those who are avid fans of Marvel, and those who just want a thrilling action movie. I happen to fall into the latter group and enjoyed watching the film pretty much, though I knew this was not exactly an \\"Iron Man\\" film. Slick and enjoyable as it is (don't miss the amusing post-credit scenes), \\"Iron Man 3\\" is less about the titular hero than about Tony Stark with lots of flying suits. Also, though I don't reveal the entire plot here, I don't know the point of introducing the super villain with ten rings in this way.<br /><br />As I said before I enjoyed the visually stunning action sequences of the film, though I am disappointed with the story that starts out well but gets pointless at it unfolds.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Jack Reacher is a great movie! Tom Cruise is a great actor! Lot's of action and a joy to watch!
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|I downloaded this game the other day when it was the free app for the day. It was great, there was no levels that I had to purchase to continue on in the game. This morning when I got the message thst the game had been updated, that all has changed. I now only have 6 levels that I don't have to pay for, all the others I have to purchase. Talk about not right. Overnight went from 12 levels unlocked to 6. Just not right, and feel that we have been cheated.
0316226424|5.0|Well here I go. I am going to try to do this book justice in this fourth and last book in the Twilight saga.<br /><br />It may sound redundant, but I have to give tremendous credit when due. And I know I said it before in my Twilight, New Moon and Eclipse reviews but: Author Stephenie Meyer is One Amazingly, Angst, Thrill Seeking, Outstanding Lady and Writer!  I know this series has ended with this book, Breaking Dawn, but I will continue to keep up with all the other books that author Stephenie Meyer has and will be writing.<br /><br />Alright, Bella has made the most important decision she has to make, will two of the most important decisions. One to marry Edward and two to become one of the family by becoming a vampire as well. And all of this while still keeping Her Side of the family and school friends in the need to know category. Wow, What a Girl!<br /><br />Jacob is trying to support Bella, but does not like what she is doing and is having a ruff time of it. He loves her but really not sure why the \\"Werewolf, imprinting thing:\\" has not happened for them. But the connection between them will come to light within the, again stomach knot tying roller coaster pages of Breaking Dawn. Through out this book my fan love has only grown for Jacob. What a Young Man, Werewolf he has become.<br /><br />Okay for Edward, my love/hate feelings for him still remain through out most of this book. I can understand Edward/vampire for the most part. But once again, he tares Bella's heart strings to pieces but comes to realize what he truely has, or will have?<br /><br />Now I am going to also give some credit to some of the other characters together in groups.<br />Bella's dad, Charlie Swan, amazing, her mom Renee, just a little over the edge so to speak but loved her. The Cullen group, Vampires, Dr. Carlisle Cullen, absolutely loved his character thru out the saga as well as his wife Esme Cullen, the momma of the family. Alice and Jasper a pair. what can I say except everyone needs an Alice Cullen in the life and Jasper Hale, you just have to love. Emmett Cullen and Rosalie Hale, Well Emmett is one that while reading the book you picture him as So Strong there is nothing going to get by him so naturally you want him on your side. Rosalie Hale, another love/hate relationship. Read the books you will understand.<br /><br />For the other side: Werewolf clan, there is Emily, love her, she is the momma so to speak for this side. Sam Uley is the Leader of the pack, Paul, Leah, Jared Quil, Embry, Seth make up the pack besides some elders. The one that really caught me was Seth. You just gotta love you some Seth. He stands on the side of the right no matter which side that is on. You gotta read the books!<br /><br />There are a few other characters through out the saga that add so much to the story, but listing them all would be hard. But believe me when I say that you have to make sure not to miss any thing in the book.<br /><br />I am going to give my rating of this some over the top heart wrenching, love, friendship, absolutely amazing saga that I have read in quite awhile. I love how it was divided up into two movies in order to do justice to the book. That alone should tell you something.<br /><br />So now that I have shared my thoughts on the book and the movie I will say this: just like Twilight,  New Moon  and Eclipse if I had a rating that was far above a five (5) clock rating these both would receive it. But since I don't.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend this Amazingly, Fantastic, Suspenseful book and movie to ALL my young adult and older readers!<br /><br />Pick it up today and please let me know what you think.<br /><br />So due to the above, I am giving this book a Breath of Life ratings of:<br /><br />Five Clock Rating!!!<br /><br />Disclosure: I did not receive this book for my honest opinion and review.

B004SOR4H6|3.0|I don't use twitter much, so It's hard to get excited about a twitter app.  Seems to do the trick.  Doesn't have great filtering.  I think it's a waste on a smallish phone screen.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun game to play and easy to pick up. I downloaded this as an alternative to sim city and it does doesnot let you down. However a major annoyance is on every achievement made g5 ask you to post it facebook to gain the full points. :( its really annoying. All in all it is a good game thats hard to l<br />Put down.
B004I8WD7S|4.0|We wanted cases for our iPhones that were durable but not as bulky as the Otter boxes we had had.  This case has taken it's share of tumbles over the last six months and it's still holding strong - get some extra screen protectors!
B00177Y9ZC|5.0|This is a decent Science Fiction movie.  I've seen it several times and knew it was a must for my video library.<br />However, the first third half of the movie could have been more developed.
6305127646|5.0|Although he's all but retired now when Val Kilmer was &#34;in his prime&#34; he was as good or better than any movie star in Hollywood and THE SAINT proves why. He plays SO MANY different characters, each with disguises and their own &#34;slang&#34; and he pulls off every one perfectly. Also, the storyline and plots are magnificent. I'd give it 10 Stars if I could. Bravo!
B000OVLBEO|5.0|Nicolas Cage delivers a terrific performance in this Science Fiction movie.  I've seen it several times and knew it was a must for my video library.
B008645YEE|3.0|The music is intense and I like it but it sounds better in the context of the movie. It is hard to listen to as a stand alone CD soundtrack.
B000TGJ8CQ|5.0|Nicolas Cage delivers a decent performance in this Science Fiction movie.  I've seen it several times and knew it was a must for my video library.
B0076DELIG|3.0|It took me a while to read it.  I didn't really think it was one of those books<br />you can't put down until it's finished.
B004TP6O8O|5.0|Rolling Papers is a Great Album! Thank you Wiz! I enjoy listening to it while getting ready to go out.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Absolutely love this movie!  It provided action, humor, and a good cast of characters. I found it very entertaining and a worthwhile purchase.
1439181780|5.0|This is a very powerful book! It shows you that all you need is love! This book will change your life!
B000AM2L1O|5.0|Ordered this for my !8 month old niece for Christmas 2011. It is still her favorite &#34;baby&#34;. It's a really good size for little ones. It has held up very well after being carted around for over a year.
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|I was obsessed with MOONWALKER - the video game<br /><br />If you LOVED the video game, you'll find that you love this, especially the Smooth Criminal video...amazing.<br /><br />enjoy :)
B008Y73940|4.0|Great mystery story. If you like John Grisham, you will like this. Recommend reading the book before seeing the movie
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|i loved the entirety of this tale but did not expect the excessive and graphic descriptiins of sexual abuse  i felt that the continued return to that subjecte detracted from the overall story
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|the only thing I don't like about it is that you have to downloaded the game after you download it from the app store
B00683JLXA|3.0|Ok for an Angry Birds copy. It doesn't seem to progress as smoothly though. Maybe it's just me but Angry Birds seems to be more fun.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|it's funny, but not as i expected. i think i had too much expectations. but it is entreating overall. f
B004TI1WME|5.0|Absolutely great for calculating expenses. Even my fiancee loves it for grocery shopping. Definitely worth the money. Get it for sure.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|How can you not like this app???<br /><br />Any economist, mathematician, financial analyst, or fellow nerd will love this amazing app.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This is actually a pretty fun little game. Moves smoothly and runs great on the Kindle Fire. Honestly the only problem I have is having to let it run for forty minutes when the lives run out just because I don't want to spend money on more of them.
B009NY43NY|2.0|Ok. Hmmmm. There are several spoilers in this review........  The book was fast and slow at the same time. Of course it picks up right after the use of the cluviel dor with Sam acting damn crazy.  But it was slow in getting to the point.  We never figure out what kind of affects coming back from the dead will have on Sam.  We never figure out who the devil is... I mean nothing else!?<br /><br />I'm not going to go though the whole book but WE NEVER GET ANY CLOSURE ON ERIC!!! Wtf? That's it, just off to get married? Wtffffffff? It didn't feel like an ending to some something I'd already read 12 of...and waited a year for. And as for ending up with Sam... That's kind of what I hoped would happen, but not as a kind of \\"we'll all else has failed so why not bang each other and see how it goes\\".  Not romantic at all! This is why we read this stuff right.  To get some serious romance that is different from the everyday life.  That's what vampires do for us.  I was hoping that they would get together and maybe she would say \\" I saved him because deep down I love him\\"or something lame like that.  And that sex scene...did not get me hot AT ALL!<br /><br />All that said...I get it.  We've been hanging with Sookie for a long time and I'm sure that CH was ready to move on too.  As a writer, you gotta do what feels right, even if all your fans are going to be pissed.  The story itself was decent on its own, but after the time and love invested in these characters, it didn't hold up its nd of the bargain. But I had to read it.<br /><br />How could it have been better.  Epilogue: Sookie sitting on the porch while Sam jr plays in the flower bed.  Sam comes out and gives her a kiss before turning into a puppy and going out to play with his son.  Sookie goes inside to get some lemonade and BAM...Eric is in the kitchen.... Hahahahahahahahaha
B00BL5EQLC|5.0|I really like this game. I love the style, the fast paced game play and the sound track isn't that bad either. The only problem I have is that I don't have more time to play it.
B007U4DIM6|5.0|I have watched it 4 times already, nuff said. i have 4 chis myself and one looks like popi and the other looks like rosa
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This was a lot of fun but it was way too short. I was finished in about 2 hours. I hope they make another one and soon!
B00APACSJG|4.0|Ms. Bujold continues the fun series with Miles and his family and friends.  She finds a new way to tie all of the different societies of the worlds of outer space together and prove that even when governments and societies are separated by light years, human foibles and morals still exist.  Good read and great story, a good addition to the &#34;Miles Saga&#34;.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Beautiful love story! I thought this would be a movie that would be predictable, however I was nicely surprised. Great family movie to put on for family night!
193700788X|4.0|In my opinion, Ms. Harris did a fine job wrapping up the series.  She found a believable way to end our sympathies with other love affairs and bring to fruition the relationship that has been foreshadowed from Book 1.  I came into this book feeling a bit skeptical, as the prior two books were grim and seemed like one book cut into two, but she ended Sookie's story on a high note.  [I only hope that the tv show, which really declined last season, can do the same!]
B009X01FJS|5.0|I likie having something to protect my kindle and was pleased to be able to get it in a color that I find attractive.  I love the Hot Pink color.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great Story Line as usual!  Love this game so far, just hate that these games tend to be so expensive.  Awesome graphics and love the little monkey as a helper!
B007N8RULO|4.0|This game is something that I have played on my home computer and my cell phone.  It is a game that I have enjoyed and it will be fun to have to entertain myself.  It is different to use on a smaller screen.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|There aren't too many shows on tv that I can get interested in but this one has me hooked. I had missed this episode so Amazon made it possible for me to stay current on it.
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|Not funny . Idid not enjoy the format used and thought the book boring What more can I say. I would not recommend this book,
B00CDXOXB4|5.0|After watching this movie makes me want to move to a small town on the North Carolina coast. I have been in this town before of South Port NC .  but forgot how beautiful it is. The movie had some twist in it and a great love story. I know I look forward to watching it again and again.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|The game has a storyline that will keep you intrigued. The graphics are great &amp; the game runs smoothly on my Kindle Fire. There are hint &amp; skip buttons, zoom in &amp; out and you are able to get the HO's fairly quickly. One of my favorite things on an HO game is if they have a few that require you to take an extra step or so in order to obtain that particular HO. For instance it may read (these clues will always be in blue so you'll know if you need to do anything extra) green car. They may have a wooden car &amp; a can of green paint you drop it in to make it the &quot;green car&quot;. You might even have to find a paintbrush, dip it in the can &amp; &quot;paint&quot; the car green before you can pick it up.<br />The mini games are fun and not too easy or too hard. There are maps that show your progress, where you have already been and a. .!(exclamation point) letting you know there is an action that can take place. You have a diary &amp; checklist as well.<br />I haven't had to use it yet but there is a strategy guide that is very in depth w/ pictures. All in all...great game! Unlike other G5 games this one did not take forever and a day to download &amp; install.<br />My only complaint? $4.99 is a bit too pricey for me but maybe that's just because I'm broke!<br />My complaint to G5? PLEASE make a new game soon. I have played ALL HO adventure games for my Kindle Fire!<br />Hope this helps &amp; happy gaming!
B009NT0I06|5.0|Great album and even better on vinyl! Very glad that more and more artists are selling their albums on vinyl.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|the first book was captivating, couldn't wait for the second book, so I downloaded it.  the third as a bit too much sex.  no one has that much sex even when you're totally in love, even at the beginning of a relationship.  Especially when she was a virgin.  it hurts too much in the beginning.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Best CPU cooler i';ver owned. I usually get the zalman which runs for about $70, but this is much cheaper and better. I've overclocked my AMD phenom from 3.0GHz to 3.5GHz for over a year now, and this cooler keeps it just the right temp.
B008G12ERC|5.0|This CD has been playing nonstop in my car for months! Muse is one of the best rock bands in recent history and this album proves that.
0385349947|5.0|Sheryl Sandberg has written a truly revolutionary feminist workplace manifesto, and she has written it from a point that feminist writing has not usually originated: from the top of the business world. Young women of my generation, who have perhaps taken women's right for granted, will rejoice to hear wide advice from one of the world's most powerful women. Sheryl doesn't have all the answers, but she sure has some great insight.<br /><br />Superbly written and impeccable researched, \\"Lean In\\" is a book that's not meant as a guiding light on how to make the planet more gender-equal, but provides a lot of very powerful food for thought. The author frequently cites important feminist authors who have led the way to break the glass ceiling - think Steinem, Ephron, etc. - but yet, in 2013, women still earn significantly less than their male counterparts for essentially the same work.<br /><br />I was fascinated by some of the ground-breaking research that the author cites about gender roles, perceptions, and gender bias. There's the famous Heidi/Howard experiment, whose outcome essentially proves that success and likability are negatively correlated - but only for women. The opposite is true for men. And then there's the fact that women don't speak up to advocate for themselves, while men routinely do - and are expected to do. On the other hand, women are expected to be demure and nice. Sounds familiar? It sounds like we are still living in 1950, in and in a way, we are. Women are underrepresented in every important field, including politics and the board of directors and C-suite of Fortune 500 companies. But why? That's the big question, and the answer reveals that gender bias is everywhere, including the lab manager who reviews identical resumes, one from a male and one from a female, and always hires the male.<br /><br />Ms. Sandberg has been called every name in the book including \\"too bossy,\\" \\"too demanding,\\" \\"not nice\\" etc, which seems to be the fate of powerful women - think Angela Merkel and Margaret Thatcher. Men can be aggressive and cruel, but when women try to lead, their clothes and hair are criticized and they are labeled as \\"not nice\\" when making tough decisions. This is all stuff we already knew, but it's nice to see research to back this all up. It's a catch-22 for women: be feminine and you are accused of getting the job only because you are a woman, not because you have earned it. Take your earrings off before a meeting, as a female engineer has done, to \\"disguise\\" the fact that you are a woman, act tough and you get labeled a \\"witch\\"--or much worse.<br /><br />The author candidly exposes her own shortcomings, trials and tribulations, errors and successes in her quest to empower women, to invite them to sit at the table and lean in rather than sitting away from the conference table, in the corner, and not speaking up, as so many of us do. We are essentially afraid of being heard, but it's time that we identify the problem, remove barriers, and take charge. This includes finally making our partners equal partners - their home can't be a hobby for them - their children, if they choose to have some, and their homes are part of their responsibility too. It's time for women to stop picking up the slack and either putting their careers on hold permanently because their partners aren't pulling their weight or to demand that their partners do their share as well. Why should women automatically stay home? Is that the way biology intended it? It's not, and the author cites a revolutionary long-time study that showed no negative effects on children who are put in daycare rather than being brought up by their mothers. While women need to make their partners equal partners, they also need to step back and let them do their thing, even if they initially put the diaper on the baby's head. They will figure it out - eventually.<br /><br />One of my favorite quotes is on page 125 - \\"Done is better than perfect.\\" Women can't do itall perfectly all the time, and neither can men. Some things will not get done, and others will get done at 80% -- and sometimes, that's good enough.<br /><br />The author concludes that it's time to disrupt the status quo, identify barriers and find solutions (page 146), and I could not agree more. Of course, the author is in a very privileged position, and she carefully notes that are situation is indeed quite unique. She's the daughter of a doctor, and both her siblings went on to become doctors, and her background is decidedly relatively posh and privileged. That said, she's also had the same struggles as everyone else - including asking for what you want from your (mostly male) bosses. I fact, she's never had a female boss, and her hope is that this will change for the next generation.<br /><br />I also really enjoyed her quote from a leading feminist during a commencement speech to a graduating class, which included a remark that the feminist movement's goal was to give women choices, but that the movement did not think the choice would be to leave the workforce en masse and leave the leading of the world and corporations to me. That was an interesting point.<br /><br />This is perhaps one of the most powerful books  for women - and for men - since \\"The Feminist Mystique,\\" and I am quite certain that Ms. Sandberg's book will have even more impact because it's coming from the top of one of the world's most powerful companies. It's amazing how much people are willing to listen if the women at the top are willing to stick their necks out. Gender equality is, for some reason, a universally unattractive and feared subject, as it can make women look whiny and weak, so I applaud Ms. Sandberg for taking on this formidable challenge.
B006M4F67A|5.0|great game and fun to play. Has a lot of variety to pick from. They have more games to enjoy as well.
1452101248|5.0|This book is ridiculous, especially if you're vegetarian. I'm not, but can with recipes like this I can't imagine it would be hard. The photographs are mouth-watering and amazing. The recipes delightful. Guy knows what he's doing. Some of the ingredients may be hard to source depending on where you live, and recipes can get expensive, but it's well worth it, and you can always substitute or leave things out and it will still be an amazing meal.
0099581876|3.0|The Bat is a very uneven effort.  It is Nesbo's first book, and it shows, particularly in his awkward writing.  He improves as he moves further into book, but initially I didn't know if I could continue reading the story because the writing was so simplistic.  Of course, mystery series readers will be able to affirm that first books in a series are always the poorest in every way (one example is Peter Robinson's series in which the first book is pretty bad and the rest are pretty darn good).<br /><br />Nesbo's plotting was acceptable for a first book, though it was too complex, like he was trying too hard.  Frankly, I was often confused and had to go back to figure out who characters were and reread events that had happened. Some of the ways Harry discovered clues weren't believable or didn't make sense.  It was also hard to believe the killer could do all the things he/she did and that he/she had the kind of computer experience needed for monitoring his/her apartment--a huge part of the story.  Also, the ending was too dramatic.  Nesbo seemed to want a thriller-type ending (and it was pretty exciting), but again it seemed like a first book gimmick. Finally, Nesbo's goal to tie an Aboriginal myth to his plot fell a little flat, especially when he came right out and explained the connection near the end of the book. Still, I thought he handled the plot and story with confidence, which is evidence of a future story-telling ability that appears in his later books.<br /><br />One thing that confuses me is that the author set his first book in Australia instead of Norway, the home country of his protagonist. Nesbo does a nice job showing Australia to the reader--some of its geography, culture, and the city of Sydney, but I kept wishing Harry were back in Norway.<br /><br />The main reason I recommend reading this book is to get the background on Harry that is missing in his later books.  We learn about Harry's alcoholism and the tragedy it caused and how he changed his life as a result.  We learn about his first love Kristin and about Birgitta whom he meets in Sydney and with whom he falls deeply in love.  We learn a little about Harry's parents.  All this information will be useful in reading the rest of the series.<br /><br />If you are interested in my reviews of many mystery series, check out my website which is given in my profile.

B00BGIC2J2|5.0|Not sure if I loved the movie or the out takes more.  This is 40 knocked it out of the park....the cast did an excellent job.

B00AAX68HG|5.0|You will not know how amazing this is until you try it. This game is so addicting I am absolutely obsessed with it. I thought it would be boring and stupid but its not. Its cute addicting and fun. If you want a mottling bit of a challenge but also addicting this is the game for you.
B004WR125O|5.0|it was very easy to install and worked fine with my home wi fi system and onkyo thx nr880 system
0765325950|5.0|while it was noticeable that mr Jordan did not write this book it was still a fitting end to the series.  it was not what I expected yet still nice finale.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Love.  this fast paced, easy game.  Gives me something to do when waiting and I don't feel like reading.  Really fun game.
B009PHQ9OA|5.0|This album is amazing. Strong lyrics and a beautiful voice to match. Usually I can pick out at least one song that I don't really like. With this album, my least favorite became my favorite once I really listened to the song and lyrics. It's beautiful. I would say the guy version of Florence And The Machine.
B0077EBWVI|5.0|We loved it!! It was a great family night movie. And the music makes you want to get up and dance with them.
B006M4F67A|4.0|I do like it, but don't love it. When you make an error, it does give you a hint to help you match, but I may not want that hint right away. Unclear why some tiles match with others and on the small size so not great for tired eyes. I will use it from time to time, but can put it down.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved the book however it reminded me a lot of 50 shades series but it is still a really good read.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I could not make it if it wasn't for a walk through I found on the Internet. Some items to place need to be very close. I guessed correctly a few times but thought I was wrong when it didn't work because I wasn't precisely on the spot.
B003JBI2KM|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys beer, brewer or not. It is of course written for the home brewer but talks a lot about the history of various beers and the structure of these beers. I am currently only halfway through the book but have learned a lot already. It is broken up into sections based on knowledge so if you already know a fair bit you can skip ahead to learning about combining ingredients to make specialty beers. Its a really fun book at a very relaxed pace.
0385344228|5.0|had a tough time putting it down.  we are reading it for a book club.  one of the better books I have read in awhile.  highly recommend.
B003GK223E|5.0|As usual Jeffery Archer deserves five stars<br />Mallory climbed everything from early youth until he at last stood on Everest.
B000IY03DM|3.0|Their voices are great, but all slow songs, nothing upbeat at all.  Very melancholy to me.  Again, I need something more upbeat.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|The whole family plays at the same time, offering suggestions, &#34;Try this, try that.&#34; Fun and creative! There are a lot of 'extras'- for example, one screen is creating things to interact with each other, another is a quest you have to create things to move your avatar through. Even someone who doesn't like video games would most likely enjoy this.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|I was so excited for this game and it's been fun so far! definitely recommend for people who like mystery type games
B008I3RARW|1.0|Race Rally 3D - Racing Car Arcade Fun  i could not get it to my phone. never got it to work. I'm glad it was free.
B00CKJTOHO|2.0|I buy these episodes through online Amazon for immediate viewing, and they are so pixelated that sometimes faces look like they've been disguised! I transfer the video to my TV through an HDMI cable, and perhaps there is some setting wrong, but there is no way to get any help from Amazon with this. Very unsatisfactory.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I really love the CD, and cant wait for the next season to come out.  I have worn out the first seasons already. LOL
B007N85POS|5.0|love this game, was so happy to find it at a great price would buy something like this again great fun.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|this is my favorite game of all angry birds, it fun easy and enjoy having it love playing it, fun,fun,fun.
B006WAIV6M|4.0|It is a really well written book - a lot of examples make it easy to read. And at the same time, the writer gives good tips and draws some broad conclusions.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|fun gam have when ever i need it it harder than it looks but i love playing this game will by more as i see them.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Shared information in an easy to read manner. Everyone should read this as the incidence of memory loss<br />Is high.

B0085GUXZI|5.0|I can't believe I found this original album for such a low price and in such great condition.  My mother collects classic rock albums and was thrilled.
B0014JGDUC|1.0|they were too big and  i ordered based on another review...not enough attractive for work as a restaurant hostess. looking for comfortable but better looking clogs/crocs.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|I use my gps every day to get from account to account in the repair/it fired . I have had tomtoms for years and love them and frankly wouldn't want to trust any other make. The tomtom 2505 is over the top . It offers a clear well laid out graphic display . It can be customized to display all the data you require . With its smart routing and the traffic option avoiding traffic jams is a breeze .The features are all great but the hands free ability for it to become the hands free unit for your cell phone is the best and how it responds to voice commands is great. It will also read incoming texts and with the properly configured smart phone you can reply to the texts hands free with voice commands.It is a must for any one who spends as much time in their mobile office known as a car as i do.clap clap for tomtom .
B008QTVNUI|5.0|i love homeland and am waiting for season 3 when it is coming out and where can i purchase the streaming ?

B0050DIWFC|5.0|it was a great book spellbinding and human could not put it down. a great read i recommend it to everyone who likes to read and be challenged by suspense.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Phillip Phillips wrote 12 of the 15 songs on this CD. I loved all of them but one. I love Gone Gone Gone and it plays in my head when I am not listening to it. I am a fan, even though I am unsure what genre of music to put him in and then again, maybe that is it in a nutshell; he's different. Awesomely talented and very different. I want more and I would love to see more of him on TV.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very well written. Hard to put down! Enjoyed it very much. I recommend it with a two thumbs up! Enjoy!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ok  this is the only game on Kindle Fire that has creepiest and zombies and ..............................I wish they put a mother one were you...................................Ok  among dots I love having the game ps. I got this game by using coins
B008FC4WA4|3.0|I liked this story but overall it fell short of awesome. The writing is almost a bit understated for the storyline.
0670014893|5.0|In \\"A Delicate Truth,\\" John Le Carre again combines an engaging spy thriller with subtle psychological portraits of his protagonists.  I was with Le Carre almost to the very end, but was somewhat troubled by the disturbing similarity of the denouement to that in \\"Six (Three) Days of the Condor\\" by James Grady.  Did Le Carre run out of his own ideas, or is this just homage to a spy classic of an earlier era?
B003XE1CU2|5.0|It always seemed to me that Crocs made your feet look like canal boats! This style solves that problem so I ordered another pair.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|This is a fun game. I like the gameplay. This puzzle/ matching game can be addictive. I would recommend this game to people who like the match three games.
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|This production shows how amazing the Cirque is, by combining James Cameron,the visuals are shown from incredible angles and rich textures.Wow,these people are outrageous.
B00C1BUYX4|2.0|I was so excited to finally have the time to rent this movie!  I had high expectations based on the reviews.  However, it was so boring because it focused on the lobbying that went on to get the Amendment passed.  I appreciate how hard it was to pass and if it wasn't for the lobbying, then it would have changed the course of history for the worse!  However, it was just talking talking talking (great acting though) but, somehow seemed to never end.  It was so boring, I even dusted my living room during the movie, left the room a few times, and still the same dialogue going on and I didn't miss anything!
B00BQXWH2O|5.0|OK Armin is awesome and this CD is equally awesome, I do have one gripe, however.  It doesn't detract at all from the audio so I'm still giving it 5 stars, but I just have to say this...<br /><br />When I opened up the CD there was a rather thick booklet in it, in fact I had a difficult time getting it out of the jewel case. I was excited to get it out thinking it would be packed with lyrics. I start flipping though it and the first couple pages are ok, but then I get to page after page of simply multi-colored BLANK pages.  There's about 15 pages in the booklet that are all different colors and have absolutely nothing on them at all.  Such a disappointment, and a waste.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|the game is a bit slow going but my seven year old granddaughter does seem to enjoy it. And since it was free......
030758836X|5.0|Flynn, G. (2012). Gone Girl. New York, NY: Crown Publishing Group.<br /><br />Genre: Thriller/Mystery, Adult Fiction<br /><br />Nick and Amy are celebrating their fifth wedding anniversary. But, Amy is nowhere to be found. She's missing. She's gone. Amy's disappearance becomes big news quickly and Nick is almost immediately pegged as the perpetrator. Flynn switches the point-of-view back and forth between Nick, in the now, and passages from Amy's diary. And it seems the two are in completely different marriages. One thing seems to hold the truth, an annual scavenger hunt planned by Amy has scattered clues all over town. Will the clues lead us to Amy? Is Nick guilty? Is anything what it seems?<br /><br />Wowzers! What a book!<br /><br />When people ask me why I do not ever want to get married...I will refer them to this book :).  Ha ha, but seriously, marriages like this are not rare. Well, this is extreme and fiction but people are dysfunctional.<br /><br />Okay, back to being serious. Flynn's writing was perfect. Yes, perfect. Not in an Amy kind of way perfect, but perfect perfect.  And intriguing. It is absolutely scary how real the characters are. Flynn spent a lot of time developing their personalities, voice, mannerisms, etc. and it paid off because their characters are fully developed, multifaceted and it is easy to visualize an accurate depiction of them.<br />A theme or message I took away from the book is, people are natural pretenders, Nick and Amy are pretenders to the world but because Flynn took us inside their heads, we were able to see them for whom they really were. Two individuals so stuck on issues from their childhoods, they cannot function appropriately. Amy is controlling, obsessive, and ruthless. Nick is cowardly, insecure, and emotionally empty.<br /><br />Flynn held my attention throughout the book with her structure and insight into human thinking. Skewed patterns of cognitive processes fascinate me and Flynn captured this phenomenon, so well. People pretend to be cool, good, or whatever they deem favorable because these ideals do not actually exist, we all just want them to.<br /><br />Flynn has some side agendas with this book. The bashing of the media and internet is almost like a second plot line. A good one, but it probably was not necessary.<br /><br />*An afterthought: Go, Nick's twin sister, was my favorite character. She is a nice contrast to these off-putting main characters with her honesty, loyalty, and humor. She was introduced to us as the dysfunctional one but girl has a good head on her shoulders.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a thriller, a mystery, or something different from the typical read. Kudos to Flynn.l.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't wait to start book 3.  Great book!  The ending leaves you on the edge of your seat.  Must read.
0385366752|5.0|Stay with it. It starts a bit slow but the more you read the better it gets. I was nowhere in guessing how it would end until I pretty much was very near the end. It is indeed a best seller
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|I haven't seen the dvd, but the live cd is awesome. Being able to finally listen to this band perform is great. I specially liked the saxophone in some of the songs, I'm not a fan of this instrument but it sounds much better and has more presence than the one on the original studio album. Excellent vovals by Staley and blues by McCready. In the booklet is a brief history of the band and it's influence writen by Barret Martin who talks warmly about Lane Staley and John Baker Saunders. I hope you like this special edition of Above as much as i do every time I listen to it.

B0059XTTW8|5.0|Gary Oldman is terrific.  And after watching it several times, the whole film only gets better.  Julio Iglesias sings the song at the end.  You can find that rendition if you go to [...]  on youtube.  And finally,  SPOILER ALERT: on the youtube video, the guy playing bass behind Julio is Mark Strong who shoots you know who at the end of the movie.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Reading a Charlaine Harris novel is like comfort food for me. It's familiar in its flavor and consistency and just so easy to pick up and consume. This one was tough for me though. Unfortunately the ending was spoiled for me before I was even halfway through so that colored my outlook on it a bit and I think it all felt a bit rushed like she wanted to just put a lid on it and be done, but I dunno. I'm a little sad it's over and a little annoyed how it ended, but overall, another decent Stackhouse book.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|The blu-ray is awesome.  The only problem was my surround speakers were packed up after a recent move.  Once the sound system is hooked back up, it will be even better.

B007V5CF5K|4.0|WOW! This game is great it really makes you think and remember where  things are.<br />Quite additive. This is one of thoughts games that you start to play but  can stop.<br />You need to find the snark it is like a snipe it consumes you trying to find it then you realised all of your time is well you know.<br /><br />On the down side though the game does crash a lot. I hope they fix it in 2. But still a great game.
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|Good show.  I think however he did a better job on Turors.  There needs to be a sequel for Tudors with King Edward and the queens Mary and Elizabeth.<br />I still enjoy watching Vikings.  It does tell how they were ruthless.  This is how they were

B00AAQWMB4|4.0|As a fan of Blokus, I really like this implementation of the game. It's very well done: the graphics are simple and true to the original, the organization of the pieces is great, and the controls are intuitive. I'd give it five stars if it had the following:<br />1. Instead of having a single check box for having all three AI players, have three separate check boxes to decide how many to have.<br />2. It needs the ability to flip pieces over. An L piece fits slightly differently than a backwards L, and not being able to flip pieces limits your strategic options.<br />3. It wasn't immediately obvious that you can see more pieces by scrolling to the right. A little arrow would work for that.

B005LAIII0|4.0|Ang Lee has a fine record for making unusual films, and from `Eat Drink Man Woman' through `Hulk' to `Brokeback Mountain' has proven to be the antithesis of a formulaic director. True to form, his film of Yann Martel's \\"un-filmable\\" book `Life of Pi' is a triumph of cinematography and storytelling. The underlying themes of God-evidenced-in-Nature and the victory of the human spirit in adversity are very well realised by Lee's narrative structure and editing, and the film is a feast for the eyes and the mind.<br /><br />The story is told in first-person narrative with Pi as narrator, his character played by four different actors as he ages. The excellent young Suraj Sharma takes the lion's share (tiger's share?) as the 16-year old Pi in the film's main sequence when adrift on the Pacific with Bengal tiger Richard Parker following a shipwreck. Sharma (picked from 3,000 actors who auditioned for the part) delivers a convincing performance of fear, struggle, cool intelligence & courage, and gradually masters his hostile environment and terrible predicament, growing spiritually on the journey as he asserts dominance over the tiger so that they might both survive. Although for safety reasons the tiger and Sharma were filmed separately, you will absolutely believe in the terrifying visceral power of their face-to-face confrontations and in their developing relationship.<br /><br />The wildlife in the film looks superb and the wild animals behave exactly like wild animals, red in tooth and claw. There's no sentimentality here, and the viewer is never spared the cruelties of nature. For this reason the film may be disturbing to young children despite its often enchanting visual content.<br /><br />The Blu-ray 3D release contains a documentary film (itself in 3D) about the making of the film in which Lee explains how he conceived the film from the beginning as a 3D experience for the audience, and that this is the medium in which it needs to be seen. There's a lot of detail here for film buffs.<br /><br />Some have chosen to nit-pick at details of the film and a few have disliked it; it may be that for those viewers this is just not the kind of story that floats their boat, so to speak. `Life of Pi' strives to explore deeper territory than the average Hollywood fare, in a highly original way. Lee succeeds in discussing the philosophy of religion; is there a creator and where can we experience evidence of it in nature? This is quite a difficult trick to pull off in a 127-minute film whilst entertaining the audience at the same time, but Lee's rare talent does just about manage it - and with a sting in the tail, too: at the end of the day, which story do you prefer?ere for film buffs.<br /><br />Some have chosen to nit-pick at details of the film and a few have disliked it; it may be that for those viewers this is just not the kind of story that floats their boat, so to speak. `Life of Pi' strives to explore deeper territory than the average Hollywood fare, in a highly original way.

B000AP04NI|4.0|I have't watched the DVD versioon yet, since I ordered it as a gift to my son. We have watched together the theater show in London, back in 1977. The product bought arrived in good order.
193700788X|1.0|I don't know what to say. I am totally shocked. A person cannot write such a bad ending to a series. It is not possible. Maybe it was a nightmare.
B000UOGHKS|5.0|I bought this CD for my daughter because she loves Madonna and it was hard to find in stores. She loved it!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Les Miserables, has been one of my favorite books and the musical the best there is.  The movie was not as good as the stage version, however if you do not compare the two, it is a great movie.

B001GCUO16|5.0|What can I say?  If you are a fan of Wolverine then you will love this and probably already have it
B00B1E6FF8|4.0|This may not have been exactly how it all played out in real life. It is, after all, a Hollywood movie, not an attempt an a precise historical portrayal, but it was well acted and crafted and a nice depiction of the tenaciousness of the CIA and its operatives to find and take down Osama Bin Laden.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|Not much more to say.  I don't see why every review requires so many words.  Sometimes especially a simple product like music all you need to say is it is a great album
B005LAIIQC|4.0|This is a well done follow-up to the Bourne Trilogy that Matt Damon starred in. It's full of great action and overlaps a portion of the Jason Bourne story. If you liked the first three Bourne movies, you're almost certain to like this one.
B002ZG9846|5.0|Can't wait for the sequel.  It will be difficult to maintain the levity of the first one while capturing interest with all the action
B00AHTYGRW|4.0|Remember those tense days back in 1980? Whether you do or don't, this movie will bring you there to relive the drama. Well acted, this is not the story of the main group of hostages held in the U.S. Embassy by the Iranian militants but rather of the small group that escaped the embassy just before it fell and took refuge in the home of the Canadian ambassador. It's a well done movie.
B007CF7L9O|5.0|I started collecting the Papo Dinosaur series of models. I love the detail and the poses. People complain about the accuracy of these dino's but I find them really rich in character and artistic creativity.<br /><br />This Brachiosaurus is based on the Jurassic Park Crash McCrearry and Stan Winston Studios concepts, like the T-Rex, Velociraptors, Triceratops, Spinosaurus and Stegosaurus that were previously released by Papo.<br /><br />I love these models and will continue to buy them when released.

0312427565|2.0|In all honesty, every time I picked this book I wanted to put it back down. I'm not saying it was bad, it just didn't interest me. This book felt like it constantly stayed on one subject, fighter planes. The book is about the whole history of landing a man on the moon.  The preparations, the conflicts, and the successes of planes, rockets, and pods all explained in rigorous detail.  It covers everything from volunteers of project Mercury to the aftermath of the moon landing.  Yet, this book explains things in unbearable detail, with all the ways a pilot can die ejecting from a plane and all the other ways a pilot has died.  Which brings me to another negative of this book, the first 3 seemingly long chapters is about nothing but the very descriptive deaths of past pilots.  Yet, I can't say that the whole book was like that, because it did change subjects but didn't change the amount of detail.  The provider of all these details, and speaker of this book, is Tom Wolfe and his audience, the readers.  His occasion for writing this book, Tom Wolfe states that, \\"This book grew out of ordinary curiosity.\\"  What is it, I wondered, that makes a man willing to sit up on top if an enormous Roman Candle, such as a Red Stone, Atlas, Titan, or Saturn rocket and wait for someone to light the fuse?\\"  If ones interest is of such and such things then one would enjoy this book.  I too have had similar questions; however, I did not enjoy how Tom Wolfe answered them.
B00BD05PEW|5.0|I collect the Papo Dinosaurs and have almost all of them. My favorite has to be the Allosaurus. This one is now right up there in stature.<br /><br />Small for it's size, it is highly detailed and worth the price.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|Loved that movie had all sorts of scenarios!  I would give detail but I don't want to give anything away.  It makes you laugh so much!
B00992CF6W|1.0|Honestly the game is boring and just plain not worth your money.  I wish they would have let me test the game out first because by 5 minutes in I was already bored out of my mind.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|This is quite possibly the best and most intelligently written American television show out there. It is smart, dark, funny, well acted, well written and beautifully filmed. It can be gruesome but honestly, what do you expect from a show about a cannibal? It will be a real shame if NBC doesn't renew it for a second season. This show is AMAZING.

0345522478|1.0|I must be the wrong age for these books--or the wrong IQ. Pre-teen and early teen seem to be the appropriate interest level, and yet, my former high school-aged students would not have enjoyed this book because in every way it is very superficial and juvenile. An over-abundance of references to current U.S. \\"Pop Culture\\" will date this book very quickly, and while it is obvious that the author does know the pantheons of many world cultures, he is nowhere nearly as knowledgeable as Neil Gaiman nor are his books in the same league--All of Mr. Gaiman's books have deep character development, wonderful plot structure, thought-provoking theme and require a brain to enjoy. This book has \\"None of the above.\\" (Go figure that a decent book would need any of those!) Want something to mindlessly read? Ok, buy it, but I certainly won't waste more of my effort or money on any more of the series.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is pretty cool. My only problem is that it sometimes gets a glitch and makes the screen jump.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Ms Sandeberg does an excellent job of combining her philosophy with her practical experience. While emphazing the role of women in and out of the wot lace, the book has many perceptive observations for men as well.
B005LAII08|4.0|Such a cute movie and we got all the different discs. We watched for a couple weeks straight. Very good and very entertaining!!!! Thank you for the movie!!!
193700788X|1.0|I was a huge fan of this series (even after books 10-12). But this last book was a terrible dissapointment. I can't imagine that someone who wrote such captivating books could write this? Even if this was the plan all along I think the author should have thought a little more about her audience. It wasn't a shocker or contraversial, it was just plain boring and lacked a proper ending. I just think we deserved more.
1594204217|5.0|Michael Pollan begins this excellent new book with the question, Why Cook?  After all, there are plenty of corporations and factory farms out there ready and willing to take over the hard part, so that all you have to do is defrost a bag or a box of something, pop it in the oven or microwave, and then consume it.  Part of the obvious answer is that all that industrial food is bad for you, full of sodium and preservatives and expensive as well.  Pollan goes on, though, to explain that by not cooking we are not only making our selves less healthy but also less connected with our world, our past, and our own human selves.  In Cooked, the author of The Omnivore's Dilemma carries on his crusade for better, simpler, more interconnected with the world food.<br /><br />Pollan orders his quest to learn to prepare better food using the four classical elements: fire, water, air, and earth.  For each element he visits intrepid experts and takes on what seem to modern eyes impossibly complicated cooking tasks, whether it's barbecuing an entire pig, chopping up multiple plants to make a mirepoix or soffrito, mastering the intricate steps necessary to produce a loaf of bread, or facilitating the fermentation process necessary to create delectable cheese, sauerkraut, mead, wine, or beer.  Each section of Cooked contains numerous fascinating anecdotes about the hardworking artists (there is no word more suitable) who have spent years perfecting their crafts.  Pollan also presents some intriguing historical theories, such as the possibility that man developed agriculture not in order to ensure a steady food supply but to make sure he always had plenty of beer on hand!<br /><br />This is not a book to read on an empty stomach by any means.  After the first couple of chapters I was craving barbecue (fortunately I have several excellent providers near at hand), while further into the book I was salivating at the thought of bouillabaisse and then luxuriating in the thought of warm fresh bread, only to find myself later on desperately desiring sauerkraut and cheese.  The only reason I could resist the various alcohols whose fermentations Pollan so attractively describes is that I do not imbibe, though I was sorely tempted to begin!<br /><br />Cooked is a wonderful book about the virtues and benefits of slow food.  Pollan takes a lighthearted tone throughout the work, but it's clear that he's really serious about the importance of weaning ourselves from the factory farm produced boxes and bags that constitute so many of our meals today.  He even provides detailed recipes at the end so that his readers can make their own pork shoulder barbecue and sauce, meat sugo and pasta, whole wheat country loaf, and sauerkraut. While it's unlikely that I'll have either the time or the motivation to completely follow one of these recipes, I will certainly be more careful about what I buy in the grocery store thanks to what I've learned from Michael Pollan.bread, only to find myself later on desperately desiring sauerkraut and cheese.

B0049JPU8A|5.0|Ran across The Script by accident; love their music.  I have other CDs and will buy more.  Just a really good sound.
B005LJITS0|1.0|It's not that it's a terrible movie. Even terrible movies generally have something about them that's positive (beer and satire worthiness). This is just mediocre, boring, and bland. The human character's aren't likable and the alien characters (casted perfectly I might add) weren't given the focus or attention they deserved and they weren't even given the dignity of helping advance the plot. The villain is neither worthy of our fear, sympathy or interest.
B0040I09RM|3.0|Personally, I wanted to stop watching 10 minutes into the 1st episode. However, my wife enjoys it and it makes her happy.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Watch this movie, seriously. Everyone that wants to know what they are really eating needs to watch this. An in depth look at the food industry and how they are screwing us.
B00006IRJU|5.0|Ahh Icehouse! I loved this band's music, as well as the band itself. The lead singer really knew how to rock the mullett hairstyle. Of course, the songs \\"Crazy\\" and \\"Electric Blue\\" are my favorites. I remember watching their videos over and over, but the entire CD is filled with great music. Just one of those wonderful 80s bands who made music so GREAT in this decade of decadence!
