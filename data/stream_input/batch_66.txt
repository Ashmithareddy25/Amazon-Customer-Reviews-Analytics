B0040I09RM|5|Just can't get enough of the show. Just when you think you've seen it all, another episode out ranks the previous one! I'm addicted.
B000L7Q4BQ|5|This book was histarical!  I loved his stories.  It was easy to follow, since each section was its own story, so you wouldn't have to have listened to one story for the other to make sense, yet it all flowed nicely.  It was one of those books that I was actually really sad when it ended and almost wanted to read it again.
B009YP9L7U|4|good
B00I3272TO|1|Amazon will charge you $2.63 per episode for 3 minute promotional videos, and it will charge you for 3 at once, completely negating any value in the season pass. Now I get to spend my time trying to convince a customer service representative to give me a refund.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon!
B00005JKNF|5|I loved this movie.  All things British interest me, so this was especially fun. It was fun to see that things are not so different above the stairs and below the stairs.  Great fun.  You do have to lilsten closely to understand the heavy British accents, but worth the trouble.
B0046B1KHG|5|We Had instant access to the movie on our computer and smart TV. It's a digital version so no added DVD case to store.
0060245867|5|My boyfriends favorite book as a child. The whole series is fantastic- giving it away as a baby present. Awesome pictures!
B003M6EAXM|5|I Love 24!! This season is one of the best! The twist and turns are almost unbelievable. Very intense
B00QW8TYWO|5|This game is not all about taking your hard earn cash which I respect in every way because there are too many apps that take away your money
B001XRLWPQ|5|I have watched this season 6 times and as a matter of fact all the seasons I have I watch all the time.<br /> I'm afaid I am addicted to Castle<br />Best series ever and heard yesterday that they have renewed it for season 6<br />I am in my glory
B008AK8FHM|5|Magnificent, stunning! He tells his story proving scientifically everything he went during the week in deep coma. There is no way to doubt him.
B002BSHWUU|5|I like the Beatles. This is a great box set. Anything anyone else says thats positive about this set is true. Buy this set.
B005IQ39AY|4|It is quite an ADDICTIVE game... Once you start playing,it's very hard to stop and put it down.  It's definitely fun.
B00OKYQZDI|5|Addictive!
B00ATDOVNK|5|I thought this game was very interesting. There were not a lot of hidden object scenes (which I liked) but it was just enough. I don't think it was worth $4.99 because its only about 3-4 hours of play but I enjoyed it anyway.
B00FAPF5U0|5|This is such an addicting game. I love it. Too bad you only get 5 lives at a time. It's a great game.
B00932ANQM|5|i love this movie.  the chemistry between Taylor Schlling and Zac Efron is awesome.  Blythe Danner always always delivers!  love this show.
B00JYSJBGI|4|I love Liam Neeson and he didn't disappoint.  He is a depressed alcoholic Air Marshal who receives threats via text during a flight from London
B00AREIAI8|5|I like it but would like to watch an event after I go through it. when you visit other horses I think we should get award for that.
B004XJRQUQ|4|I thought I wasn't going to enjoy this series but I was wrong! I can't wait for the movies to come out for Catching Fire and Mockingjay. :)
B000RFPORM|3|This is a classic film, but - to be honest - a boring one as well. One must admire Fellini's craftsmanship and talent, but the plot moves slowly and has moments that feel unnecessary. You should watch this if you study film or if you're in the mood for something mildly surreal. Just be prepared for a little sluggishness.
B00DJFIMW6|5|I love it and play all the time! so addicting and can't put it down!! Have a lot of friends who play it now as well!
B00DGMVJAO|4|It was a good movie and I would watch it again. The whole family enjoyed it from age 34 to 4.
044656740X|5|Fanatastic book. I'm happy of reading. It comforted me in my all days investing actions.  It's a shame that this book is not on the schools agendas.....
B008ASLK8A|4|It was a good time passer... A little bit drawn out but none the less ok ..  will be surprised if there is another.
B0002IQHY8|5|This album is classic Alan Parsons. Turn down the lights, turn up the stereo, and forget everything else. \\"Return To Tunguska\\" reflects the classic AP style, reminiscent of \\"I Robot\\" (from the \\"Project\\" days), and \\"Apollo\\" (more recently). \\"More Lost Without You\\" is classic rock, AP style. Give this song a listen through headphones, very layered, and some interesting sound effects.<br /><br />I have always enjoyed Alan Parsons' music, and it is very exciting to have another classic. \\"A Valid Path\\" gets five stars.
B007J4T2G8|5|GREAT BOOK. EASY READ. I DEFINITELY SUGGEST THIS BOOK TO ALL FEMALES, GREAT FOR SPICING UP YOUR LOVE LIFE IN THE BEDROOM!! ENJOY
B00IU0M85C|4|Tatiana Maslany true great break through performance.
B005LAIIKI|5|If you haven't seen it yet make sure you do. Awesome story line and great acting by all the stars
B005DJREJS|5|This is such a great series.  I would highly recommend, but know it does have harsh language and adult situations. The cast is cleaver and the storyline is something anyone who has been through high school could relate to.  I can't wait for the new season!
B000EULJLU|5|Love this band with all my heart.  I had to have the CD in my collection.  Great price for a great product.
B00E8KLWB4|5|I think in is fun. Youcan get so warped up in it. Mind using.I even got my mom to do it with me....
B00KTS9ZFY|1|Definitely not his best work.  Two good songs does not a good CD make.
0399128964|5|Frank Herbert did a great job on this book. I'm currently reading it for the second time and plan to read the rest of the series later this year.
B00138H1RS|1|Didn't like it much
B00KDEVVDI|5|Way more than I expected, this app shows where everything is in the body. ALL systems and is easy to use.
B004ZNAXX2|5|Somewhat disappointed with the DSOTM Immersion set, no live concert footage of the album, opted for the Experience addition of WYWH, because, let's be honest, the Immersion set was very little additional content for 5 times the price. After all, I can see the animated \\"Welcome to the Machine\\" clip on You Tube. But I was really excited about The Wall Immersion Set, and wasn't disappointed. This one really has some teeth to it, as far as extra content goes, that is if you really like Pink Floyd and want to hear it.<br /><br />Disk 1 & 2 were the 2011 re-masters. To be honest, I can't tell the difference. I've read a lot of reviews about the re-master that complained about the volume level, and I agree they could have turned it up a lot. I thought that was the reason for re-masters, to get a crisper, cleaner sound at a higher level. I still have to crank this one, then when I shuffle into another song on another album, my ear drums blow out. Believe me, I didn't give this 5 Stars for the re-master, and I was so hoping this would be a great re-master.<br /><br />Disk 3 & 4 were re-masters of \\"Is Anybody out There\\", the original wall concert released in 2000. If you don't already have the album, it's worth having. If you do have it, this re-master doesn't make the Immersion set worth buying. It's kind of like, \\"okay, I have another copy of this, in case I lose the other one.\\"<br /><br />So I kinda blew off over 50% of this box set, as a so what, so why did I give it 5 stars.<br /><br />Well, it's the two disks of bonus material. There is a lot of really good material here that you've never heard before, the antithesis of the DSOTM and WYWH box sets, and what they were missing. If you really want to hear the evolution of the great songs on this album, you get a really good taste of it. From Roger Waters home demos, (Short clips and wish they would have been longer) to David Gilmour's original Demo of the Music which became \\"Comfortably Numb\\" and \\"Run Like Hell\\". Even in these earliest Demos you can defiantly here where Roger was going with this stuff and why Gilmour's contribution to the Album was more then what he is given credit for. The band demos are great too, as you here how the songs developed. \\"Teacher, Teacher\\" which ended up on The Final Cut with revamped lyrics and \\"Sexual Revolution\\" which ended up on Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking were outtakes from the original demos. Some of these band demos actually are fun to listen to as well as being educational. I am so happy they released these, however, if you are not a big Floyd fan, you may find some of this stuff tedious.<br /><br />The disk of video material, though still sparse in my estimation, is much better than the other two Immersion sets. There is about 75 plus minutes of material here, most of which is the Behind the Wall documentary, which I've seen before but don't have on a DVD. Also, one cut \\"The Happiest Days of our Lives\\" from the original wall concert, which was really enjoyable to watch, though it left me wanting for more of it. The Gerald Scarfe Interview was decent, and overall, this was a good video disk. To the band, please release the wall concert video. You apparently have the material.<br /><br />Overall, this is what an Immersion set should be. You shouldn't be able to digest everything in one sitting, and the extra material should be stuff you've never heard before. It will take awhile to get through this one.
B00005N6KG|4|I love these headphones, but the price is absurd.  Apparently, they have been discontinued, and what used to cost $15 now costs more than $125.  You can buy a TV set for less than that.  RIDICULOUS.
B00AA7V2Z0|5|This season's shows had me glued to my laptop.  I started watching season 1 because of how much I liked season 3.  I'm on season 2 now. Unbelievable suspense and horror!
B0052GACNM|5|like his music
B00EMXBDMA|5|One of the best SCIENCE Fiction books in a long time. Lots of details and lots of action. Can't wait for the movie!
B000002U82|5|If there is a god I will never have to spend time with the idiots who rate this album 1 star. Say Praise Jesus.
B00005JKED|1|THE worst!  Washington and Hawke exchange badly scripted rants in performances no better than those found in really wretched community theatre.  Fuqua's uninspired directing turns this movie into a typical made-for-ghetto blaster.  The corrupt-cop genre has been done better MANY times before.  As for Oscar, God in not great, D.  In this case, God is overly generous.
B0054JZC6E|3|on my kindle I have a hard time but on my girlfriend ipad it's better all the way around :(
B000C20VPA|4|I'd say this is practically as good as Goodfellas.  The acting is top notch.  The shots of vegas are very nice.  The movie even has some comical relief at times.  It was more violent than I thought for some reason.  The ending was the only thing that confused me a little bit.
B00480OHWK|5|I love, this book!! Great story and kids love it. I gave it to my one year old cousins and it's their favorite.
B00785P2QC|4|Great game to kill some time. Easy to advance, energy refills pretty quick. It's been great fun, have spent hours playing.
B009LDCZ7I|4|Enjoyed
B0089LOG02|4|this book is really well written and an easy storyline to follow; I would recommend this book and more of Kline's books
B00E8KLWB4|2|Very unclear
B00HERGM86|4|An excellent sequel to the THOR Movies and an even better continuation to the Marvel Cinematic Universe line of movies. Well worth the having.
B004XJRQUQ|5|There is no age limit to this trilogy. It is a story of deep despair and undying love.<br />You won't regret reading this, except maybe regret the time lost buried in this endless story.
0375713751|2|This book is better birth control than an afternoon at the Park Slope Food Coop (habitat of the undisciplined bobo brat). The endless hassles and humiliations that make up Kate Reddy's days juggling high-powered career, kids and husband gave me a case of heartburn and elevated blood pressure just from turning the pages. Pearson's zany plot twists verge on sadism, even if the character's decision to sell her soul so completely for cash renders her unsympathetic from the start.  For a certain tiny, VERY privileged slice of society, the horrors of Kate's life may approach reality. But, like hemorrhoids or cockroach mating habits, are such mundane yet unpleasant subjects worth reading about if they're not rendered by a master? This is only middling work, and I can't imagine a harried mother would want to spend her free time reliving the worst moments of her life. Quick, someone, tie my tubes!
B0036UMM84|5|5 stars. awesome movie! it took me 37 years to finally see this movie. now I own it! yay Horray!
B009XIXVU6|2|After THE KITE RUNNER, I expected more.  Started over twice. Just did not have the readability I needed to give a better recommendation
B00005UKKF|5|This is such an awesome DVD. Britney puts on the best show ever. The ending is &quot;THE BEST&quot; Any Britney Spears fan should own this DVD. 5 stars!
B00EMJBVAI|5|Excellent rendition of future world problem.
B009ZZDNT6|5|This app works very well. Wakes me up every morning so I am not late for school.  Best app I have tried.
B0015AARJI|4|finally we have rumble.  still, this isn't as nice as the xbox 360 controller.
B005AVIW54|1|I think it was a pretty disgusting book. If I had behaved the way JB had behaved, I would be ashamed and would have preferred to disappear quietly, without all his bravado.
B00FAPF5U0|4|This is the most surprisingly addictive live of brilliance ever made. The only draw back is if you have to reset your device, you have to start all over.
B001BTG3OQ|5|If you have a Nikon digital SLR greater then an D80, and want to use Nikon's \\"CLS\\" you owe it to yourself and your photography to check out the SB-900. It's not cheap, in fact, it's a piece of professional hardware in every way. Including cost. However, coupled with a pair of SB-800's or SB-600's this strobe can do absolutely amazing things. The only drawback is that it has grown in size in a serious way since the SB-28 series design of which the SB-800 was the last. If you can fit it in your camera bag, and can afford it, and use flash a fair bit - you will not be disappointed. A great strobe!
B00992CF6W|5|I love minecraft! I've been playing minecraft since I was 5 years old. It is soooooo awsom but I wish there were horses like minecraft pc.(0o0)l
B0002OERI0|5|This album is awesome! 100/10 for every single song! We need anothe r Green Day album for 2006! I hope thay play punk rock until they're like 50 or something
B00BI73CVI|3|Glad I watched it, for the information of how it was then; but moved too slow; and I'm not REALLY a musical movie/play person...
0525478817|5|Simply put, this was a beautiful book. I laughed, I cried, I thought deeply. Well worth the six or so hours it took to read. Marvelous.
B008Y720JU|4|Cute little movie.
0375507507|5|You will be carried away to a childhood in a foreign land..foreign to Westerners at least..and be the better for it.  I surely appreciate the U.S.A., but find it somewhat difficult to understand the preference of living in Africa and foregoing all the amenities offered in &quot;more civilized&quot; territories.  There is a charm in the telling of this tale and also a sharp edge of living conditions that I would not wish to put up with.  The author does well indeed to keep things interesting.  I read this book out loud to my wife and it is a winner (my wife also agrees)!
B003LQ3YXU|4|I love it. There is just enough mix of sci-fi and humor to keep you interested. My daughter loves it as well.
B00063MBU8|5|this is by far the best cd i have listened to in a very long time.  this album is so good and all the songs have a strong message.  i think simple plan did an awesome job of writing these songs and coming up with the different songs.  i love every single song on this cd.
B0083GQKQG|1|Talk About Kevin . . too disjoint and illogical.  Hard to follow the general premise<br />Surprised it was rated as high  as it was
B00000251N|5|The CD is great.  Thankful that I have it.
B00FAPF5U0|4|good game
B000050XEI|5|After hearing one of Enya's songs in a bookstore one day I bought the cd and it has not left my cd player since then...it is an excellent cd that has terrific music and leaves you with a peaceful feeling
0525953094|4|Not as good as the other two books in the Trilogy.  A little boring in parts - devoted too much space to segregation in the United States and Human Rights.  These are, of course, important matters, but he devoted too much time to this segment and it got a little boring in parts.  I LOVED the first part of the book.  Have loved Ken Follett's writing for years.
B004J4WKUQ|5|Great quest story for 80s babies and those who look back fondly on retro pop culture. Highly recommended! Fantastic book
B006OCM0G0|5|Is there a way to load and play your old game instead of having to start over?
B00EY8ARYS|1|horrible writing and acting...i'm a huge fan of Marvel products...movies.comic books.etc...this knock off of the Avengers was unacceptable...my advice to Josh is to can these actors and get better script writers..or even direct an episode yourself to get the series off the ground...cause these first results are embarrassing...
B00AO2P3GA|5|This to me is the best game ever invented by gameloft, hell I even think this is almost equal to COD<br />,so gameloft keep making more great games like this...  :)
B000066NW0|5|As an &quot;older&quot; person who grew up during the Beatles years and gotten accustomed to musicians being male dominated, it's refreshing to see young female rockers like Avril, Michelle Branch performing with musical instruments as well as signing and writing songs.  <br />I am impressed that music is done by a 17 year old girl.
B002NXSRVG|2|This a simple movie - all flash and no substance - just like the cartoon. If you're one of those pre-teens who embraced the animated version in the 80s, you'll probably enjoy this thing, because it shovels out the same formula: beefcakes, big guns, explosions, dumb dialogue, cheesy jingoism, massive property damage, and militarism without consequence. If that's not your thing, run away. Hollywood is cashing in on an old, ugly pop icon.
1439153663|5|I'm not a very big reader and found this book one I had a hard time putting down. It was easy enough to read, and the story line kept me engaged.
B0067Q42BY|1|It completely locked up on my Xoom. The screen orientates upside down and the Player dialog is off the edge of the screen. I never  did get to play it.
B003U69IX6|5|My two sons age 8 and 10 love the Percy Jackson series, they just wish there were more in the series. Check out the books as well, that is motivating them to read more.
B007ZGO7EM|3|This is nice to have on hand but not really necessarily important for when you already have a calculator to use.
B00K2CHWOI|1|One of the worst sci-fi movies I've ever seen.very poor replay value because you'll never sit through it a second time.
B00KA87GCW|5|Super fun game!!
B00DR0PDNE|5|Does what I want it to. Netflix works, Youtube works. For $35 you can't go wrong!
6303314015|5|The Lion King has beautiful animation, GREAT songs (Be Prepared sends  shivers down my spine), good characters, a brilliant villain (unlike  certain other Disney bad guys) and marvellously quotable dialogue.  This  and Mulan are my favourites, however I can't watch the scene with Mufasa's  death because I cry too much.  I definitely recommend this film, however I  can't bear the Timon and Pumbaa spin-off.
B006OAB3ME|2|I always considered it a very bad sign when a musical artist (esp. one with a rock background) decides that it time to put out a collection of \\"standards\\".  And unfortunately Paul McCartney's Kisses on the Bottom has not changed my mind about this.<br /><br />The vast majority of songs here are listenable, even pleasant, and show case Paul's aging voice quite well.  However, there's a lack of energy by Paul and Diana Krall's backing band throughout.  The end result is bland, homogenized, and rather boring.  This wouldn't be so bad from someone like Rod Stewart (who hasn't had anything worthwhile to say since the mid 70s), but from an icon like Paul this is a massive disappointment.<br /><br />It has been 5 years since Paul has released a new studio album - 2007's [[ASIN:B000P2A242 Memory Almost Full]] - and he comes back with this?  I sincerely hope that this isn't a sign that Paul has run out of interesting or valuable things to tell us.
B00L9B7IKE|4|A page turner. . . reminiscent of Gone Girl.
0920236162|5|Our family has had this book for years.  As a grandma, I've read it to the grandsons to show them that they need to have manners and be greatful for things that are done for them...especially if a young lady is involved.  I've read it to the granddaughters to show them that girls can be strong and accomplish whatever they want and desire to do, but most importantly, they should require the respect they deserve from boys.
B00DR0PDNE|5|So awesome on all accounts, used mostly for Netfliz and Hulu but watched countless baseball games with mlb.tv. Great signal strength and streaming device.
0761163808|4|Looking at several physical copies of this book side by side, some must have minor alignment defects that prevent the effect from working equally well in al images.
B00AB7HESI|1|I had this game on my ds and I loved it. now TRYED to get it on my kindle fire 1st edition and I payed but it said download fail. I did it twice and paid for both. This is ripe off!
B00H58VGIA|5|What a great story!  It took great courage to take a stand for the rights of the slaves and for women in a time when such thoughts were considered blasphemous.  I could not put this book aside until I had read every word!  I would encourage others to do as I did: read the Afterward first, then the book.
0887307280|2|Useful business management content but incredibly diluted through the story telling style and waffle. Its like reading a novel in places and gets pretty tedious.<br />His points could have been put succinctly in 50 pages, instead it gets dragged out for far too long. <br />Disappointing.
B00C9VFWP6|5|This is the Live After Death for the 2010's. What an excellent live recording! Stu Block is easily one of the best voices in metal today and makes a magnificent addition to Iced Earth.
B00V7MJXJ4|5|It's is awesome you will love it its AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!!!!<br />awesome you will be on it all night!!! Love it
B000LC4CVA|5|I've beem wanting this video ever since I first saw it on pbs, it's fantastic.  I love the songs, and the singers look great too.[[ASIN:B000LC4CVA Celtic Woman - A New Journey: Live at Slane Castle, Ireland]]
0486282112|5|I HAD TO READ FOR SCHOOL. IT WAS  A READING ASSIGNMENT. IT WAS A GREAT BOOK. I DONT THINK I WOULD HAD READ IT IF IT WERENT FOR SCHOOL
B002VPE1AM|1|Here we have James Cameron's new film; chock full of CGI, boring action and....well, that's it, really, nothing else at all.<br /><br />So, a group of human soldiers invade a foreign planet, and the residents are peeved; so, it's Starship Troopers, but without any intelligent satire or....anything really.<br /><br />Don't give me this \\"movies are supposed to entertain\\" argument either; that's only one part of the role of a film, but Cameron isn't aware of this; from his days under Roger Corman (where he should have stayed) to his newest 11 year old boy's wet dream he's proved this.<br /><br />I end the review with a quote, on Cameron, by a man who understands cinema in its totality:<br /><br />\\"Cameron isn't evil, he's not an a-hole like Spielberg. He wants to be the new De Mille. Unfortunately, he can't direct his way out of a paper bag.\\"
B0034DGPEU|5|Loved it...as good as The Help...if not better...I felt the characters were right here with me telling their stories to me.
B0052GVGYG|4|Saw their live concert on AXS television the other night and decided to buy the album ... Awesome!  Blues rock at its best!  Derek Trucks can flat tear up that bottle slide guitar and Ms. Tedeschi sounds almost reminiscent of a younger Bonnie Raitt except a little more 'down to earth'.  Try &#34;Come See About Me&#34; and &#34;Learn How to Love You&#34; for good rockin' and for listening pleasure, if you have the time, try &#34;Midnight in Harlem&#34;.
0446608955|5|A Walk to Remember tells the tale of discovering pure, innocent love for the first time and then having that love returned and unexpectedly taken away. The character who tells the story, shows that even he is surprised at how his life can be changed by love. In true Sparks style, the writing is descriptive and tugs at the heart strings. Tears will be flowing for happiness and for sadness before you get to the end.<BR>Another book that looks at innocence lost and growing up is If I'd Only Known... by Edee Wilcox. It isn't about a death, but other events change the main character's life forever. It also has a strong Christian influence as this book does.
B00FATEJYE|5|Really good game have enjoyed playing<br />Usually not into fighting games but this game has really kept my interest.  This game is great for teens and adults.
B00DPM7TIG|4|Wonderfully written, touching story great texture
B000957O82|5|hitch is a great movie with a great storyline. if you love will smith you will love this movie!
B000VWE5OY|2|Couldn't hear the dialogue over the background music. A fault of many films today. A waste of my money....but not of my time....
0375842209|5|I normally wouldn't grab a book from the young adult section (or even the historical fiction section) for myself, but I am SO GLAD I did! This is a wonderful, but sad story told by Death. The setting is in Germany during WWII and it follows a young girl's journey to try to lead a normal life during the holocaust. Not being an avid history buff, it really gave me a better perspective into the history of that time. After I bought the book, I found myself unable to put it down...even into the wee hours of the morning. I finished the book in 2 days and then purchased a copy for each of my sisters. Don't be discouraged by the book's targeted audience or that it is \\"historical\\" fiction. I highly recommend this book - but beware: you may need to make the time to read it cover to cover, it is THAT good!
B004Y1WCDE|3|This app lets you share your media files online. It's not like torrents where you share your media with 1,000s of people. You can only share with a set circle of friends, so it's pretty much like real life in that respect. And hopefully it won't get taken down by the FBI after the raid the millionaire founders house in New Zealand only find out that everything he was doing was legal, and the things they did to arrest him were illegal. But that's another story altogether.<br />The video quality is pretty random. It can often stutter like youtube in the old days. These are not the old days. But the UI is easy to navigate, and it organizes all your media well. If they can get a decent bitrate it will become the best app ever.
B00P77ZAN8|5|Free to play, and not very hard to earn money to buy more cards... doesn't get much better than that :-)

B00BWJARHO|5|i enjoyed the the tie in with the Lord of the Rings right from the start. I cn't wait for the follow up.
1603580557|5|I received the book the next day. It was as described and arrived on time. Overall I am very satisfied with the order
B00000G3AZ|5|This is one of the greatest movies of all time.  The character development is thourough and deep.  This is a VERY text heavy movie, so if you don't enjoy a LOT of talking, this probably isn't for you.  My wife and I laughed out loud AND had tears our eyes multiple times.  Great movie!
B005ZMUXDC|5|One of my 5 yr old granddaughters favorite movies, mine, too. Love to watch it over & over again!
B00H58VGIA|5|I enjoyed it so much, I did not want it to end.  I wanted to find out what happened to them since they got free.
B00HBQWGXK|5|This was one of the best Jack Reacher books... keep 'em coming.
B00BCMT4RA|4|This was my first venture into the &#34;real&#34; blues and I have really enjoyed it. The songs on this album are different than what im used to(heavy metal) but they are well crafted, well written, and really good songs.Because of this disc I have opened my mind to a whole new world. Ive gotten other cd's from guys like stevie ray Vaughan,buddy guy, and howlin' wolf and a few others. This is one of those disc that when I put on I cant just listen to a song or two but I have to hear the whole album.I wouldn't hesitate recommending this album to someone.
B00FIN0TGY|5|Wonderful book, like the trials and tribulations we went thru to get the first locomotive just is more humorous and very disc world way. Another Moist Von Lipwig adventure.
B00HGJ18C2|3|Don't remember even buying this.
B0099Y2MYK|5|The movie is set in the early 1900's and portrays I bet what actually happened in the great houses of the times.<br />Product arrived on time and was packed well.
B0000TB01Y|5|I bought this cd because so many people had told me how amazing it was. I bought it and the first song came on. It actaully scared me because of the loud hit. But I started to listen intently. Idina Menzel (also Maureen in RENT) gives her best performance to date. Her range is incredible and her voice is perfect for each song. She has a very low mysterious voice and a powerfully high section especially on Defying Gravity. But she also shows she can contain its power on For Good.  <br /> <br />Also Kirsten Chenoweth who is best know for Tony award winning place on You're A Good Man Charley Brown, stands out with her voice. She has a very operatic voice at times but it suites so many different styles. Its absolutly perfect for the part.  <br /> <br />Overall I was completely pleased with this CD and know that it will go down in Broadway history as an amazing and unique show. Here is my top 5 songs <br /> <br />1. For Good <br />2. Defying Gravity <br />3. As Long As Your Mine <br />4. What is this Feeling? <br />5. No Good Deed <br />
0345472322|5|One of the new self-help books - scientific books written by leading researchers in the field, such as The Procrastination Equation by Dr. Piers Steel - it's also one of the best. I recommend reading Alex Vermeer's (alexvermeer.com) reviews of the book.
B000EULJLU|5|Finally \\"10,000 Days\\" is here and I thought I would be disappointed with this album. When I first put the album in my CD player I was shocked with it. I have to say that \\"10,000 Days\\" blew me away like all Tool albums. I listened to every track and when I was done I listened to them again. This album is not as good as Lateralus, but it is my second favorite Tool album. Ignore the negative comments about this album, just go out and buy it you will not be disappointed.
B00BP4Z8XY|3|I feel like there was a lot more they could've done with this, which would've given the story more diversity. TONS of video game worlds are available to you, but you really only see three? Let down.<br />There was also very little emotional pull for me, though I really feel like, again, there was enough potential for it. Just unused potential, it seems.<br />The animation is good & the basic storyline is solid, I just wish it would've packed more of a memorable punch.
B009PMEEY2|5|and cute interesting storyline that could've been expanded a bit more. Pick your favorite enhancer for hard levels. Yay! Fun!
0385528752|5|I had to read this for a class, but ended up thoroughly enjoying it and bought another book they recommend in the book as well as another Chip and Dan Heath book because of this one.
B00C8S9W0G|5|I can't help myself- I'm a fan. Always have been. I received my copy on date of issue and saved it until last week.<br />Can't wait for the
B00DFFHUUA|2|Killed off almost everyone from the first movie.
B00D7Z4GQY|5|Loved this book. Definitely a winner! 5 stars
B004SIP7AS|5|I've watched this movie many times but never tire of it.  There is something about the period that is captured so well, and despite the fact that this is not a mini-series, but only a regular length movie, I think it captures the essence of the story very well, and I enjoy it as much as the Colin Firth Pride and Prejudice.  The actors and actresses seem so well fitted to their roles - it is a joy!
B008JFUUQ2|3|My 14 year old granddaughter loves it and my daughter liked it.  Definitely a chick flick.
B008Q08EV8|3|Ok movie with some good action.
B005XN31LY|5|I love the plot twists from the initial faery tale stories I heard as a child. This show is quite dark and twisted in a sense, but it does keep the same messages that those stories had for us as children that a lot of today`s children`s show lack. This show is not all about beauty and material wealth that is encouraged often times today, so I highly appreciate that.
B000QRIGLC|5|A great read. Couldn't put it down. A well written book about life in combat and life as a SEAL.
B00GSO8I1U|5|Hackett's live takes on classic early Genesis material are fabulous. The guitarist has assembled a smokin' band and has arranged these songs authentically. This makes me want to investigate his original material, which I am now busy doing. If you love Genesis circa 1969-1977, you'll be very pleased with this excellent disc set,
B0000AKY7O|5|Santana always played a blend of latin jazz and rock, but the accent was usually on rock.  This album is the closer to jazz than rock.  I liked it when it was first released (and I wasn't particularly into jazz yet), and over the years I came to like it more and more.  It is a truly outstanding and unique recording.  It does not have the standard Santana sound (which I also think is great) -- except for \\"Flame Sky\\", the guitar playing is quite restrained.  Mike Shrieve's drumming is excellent throughout -- somehow he manages to sound simultaneously relaxed and frenzied.  I never liked the opening track all that much, and I'm not always in the mood for \\"Flame Sky\\", but rest never gets tired.     Note: I have the old, non-remastered version without \\"Mantra\\"

B009UX2YAC|5|I play this game at least  20 times a night. I try to get the letters every night! I also try to complete two of the three challenges every night.
B00HGJ18C2|5|I play this all the time. I love the classic Solitaire, and i haven't had any issues with it at all.
B0001WE6U2|5|Fits camera well in both directions. Costs a little more but it works!
B00FEMJF6O|5|I love this Castleville version. It's much better than the original version on Facebook. I really like playing this game and will continue too play.
0811879542|5|You have to get this book for your little one.  In a world of super high tech distractions, this is a simple, enjoyable, experience that elicits joys, wonders, and laughs from kids, and the adults reading it to the smaller, louder versions of their parents.  Also makes a fantastic gift idea...ideal age, around 2 years old and up.
B00E8KLWB4|5|ive been playing for a few days now and I really line the story. just hate that I keep running out if energy and that I have to wait for more.
B00170KA0C|5|Watch again
B00QW8TYWO|5|It is a really good game. you can unlock secret caricatures or regular caricatures. as well their is nothing bad in it so you don't have to worry about it. it is really a challenge to get over your high score and unlocking secret caricatures. but how ever if you do not like the idea of getting ran over 100 times then this game is not for you. If I could I would rate this at 100,000,000,000,000.
B00005K3OT|5|This is a wonderful romantic movie that all people can enjoy.  It has a flar of comedy and a enjoying story line.  Even your boyfriend will like it.  There is something for all.  Not to mention, the acting by all involved is really well done.  Don't miss this movie!!!
B00HWWUQYY|5|Great
B002N5N5LG|5|Words cannot describe just how much I love this show. It's easily the most brilliant comedy I've seen since 'Arrested Development'
B007SGLZP8|1|Same guy who used to write enjoyable well crafted escapism?? Boring and so many preposterous leaps of faith. The man has lost his touch.
B009UX2YAC|4|Fun game. Could use more in the directions side.  My year old caught on fairly quickly. Game works well on the Samsung.
B006MHWXMS|1|This is a solid app that works very well with the Google task feature of Google Calendar.  I wish the app would work with GroupWise.Updated: I guess the app no longer works with the Samsung S5. Very, very disappointing.
B006MW3V6U|5|I was so thrilled with Downton Abbey.  I can't wait for season three, I am sure the plot thickens with Bates being in jail, and Mary and Matthew's  impending wedding.
031632406X|4|As a WW2 Vet, found this very good reading and appreciate all this portrays!
B005ZOBNOI|5|I CANT EVEN TALK ABOUT THIS OMG PLEASE READ THIS BOOK AND WATCH THE MOVIE ASAP NOW OMG THANK YOU JOHN GREEN
B00EGMQIJ0|4|I liked: How the technology and information gathering could be applied in our everyday lives<br />I disliked: Character is somewhat naive about the values of the three wise men, they are not in it for philanthropic reasons, it is power they are after
B006I1OB0U|5|mom loves
1442339527|5|Good info and prepared me for my master certified negotiation expert real estate designation. Very useful.
B00HY7VU60|5|I really enjoyed this series. I also read the book.
B0042TV4IW|4|Great series.  Love the era, costumes , and life experiences
B004EPYZUS|4|\\"Your mission, should you choose to accept it...\\" After a mission goes south and the Kremlin is attacked and partially destroyed the IMF division is blamed. This event causes the government to cut all ties with the agency. Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his team of now independent agents are in a race to stop a mad man from starting a nuclear war and prove that the IMF is innocent. I have to admit that I have liked all the movies in this franchise (except the 2nd one) and was looking forward to this one. After a long hiatus I have to admit that the series is back with a vengeance. The action and gadgets were great as always and this one seemed more real then the others to me. There were a few call back shots to the other movies which made it more interesting to me. The addition of Simon Pegg really was brilliant and he was my favorite part of this movie. Jeremy Renner is one good character away from being the star of his own franchise and I have a feeling that will happen soon. This is a must see for all action fans, not just fans of the series. Overall, not quite as good as the first one but this has come the closest of all the sequels so far. I give it a B+.
B00GLX1MG6|5|Hilarious, laughed and laughed.  Sure it was somewhat predictable, but soooo funny.  A great movie to watch if you need to have a good laugh!
B00DMCV7K0|5|Amazing!!! Worth every minute! Wonderfully woven in tradition with careful attention to the relationship between Sarah and Hetty. Truly beautiful.
B0002OXVDW|5|I have bought many VCR tapes and DVDs of old movies  <br />in the past two years because I like seeing the actors, actresses, singers, and dancers of many years ago. <br /> <br />\\"That's Entertainment!  The Complete Collection\\" shows many, many of the best artists in show business.  I watch some portions over and over again. <br />
B000WS4PCO|5|Classic
B0051ANPZQ|5|A great book. Well written and presented. Each of the character's story is presented and the reader is compelled to see the viewpoints of each one.
B0051MKMNC|5|awesome movie can't wait to see again!
0553212443|5|A Christmas Carol is about an old bitter man named Scrooge, who in decades has not showed any compassion to any living creature for uncountable years.  Ebenezer Scrooge owns a firm called Scrooge and Marley - Jacob Marley being his business partner and sole confidant who passed away years ago.  On the night of Christmas Eve, while preparing to retire from his busy workday, he hears boisterous noises and frustrated and frightened answers simply by Bah! Humbug's!  Marley's ghost, tied to heavy chains, appears in front of the stupefied Scrooge and alerts him that three ghosts will be visiting him that night and he must follow and obey them in order for him not to suffer the same consequence as his partner Marly.  That night all of the three visit and show him his past, present, and future.  Scrooge, alarmed from his future outcome changes to become the caring, charitable, and socially conscious man he was years before.  Christmas morning he shocks everyone around with his Christmas spirit.  Later that morning he gives Bob Cratchit - worker of Scrooge - the honor of being his equal partner in the firm and gives Cratchit's children the best Christmas they'd ever been the witness to.  <BR> I enjoyed A Christmas Carol very much, I give this piece of Charles Dickens work five stars because it is a heart warming, extremely well written novel that anyone and everyone should read in their lifetime.
0307346609|4|This was a very good book. I love the concept, and I am not ashamed (well, ok, I'm a LITTLE ashamed) to admit that I, a twenty-year-old man, was kept awake at night by both The Zombie Survival Guide's \\"Outbreaks\\" section and much of this book's tales from survivors, nervously glancing out the window from time to time or pausing to listen for a distinctive moan. Unfortunately, however, I feel this book does not quite live up to its predecessor, The Zombie Survival Guide. The Guide is one of my all-time favorite books, and a major part of its clever appeal is the way in which it is presented: serious, earnest, and with almost no sense of \\"tongue-in-cheek\\" zanyness that would have screamed to readers, \\"GET IT? GET IT? IT'S NOT REAL!\\" The Guide was presented as a stern, no-nonsense instructional on how to survive an undead attack. This book is too presenting in a mostly straight-faced manner. Really, the only sections I felt were a little silly were the Grover Carlson and T. Sean Collins \\"interviews\\". They both seemed more like the author's view of the Bush Administration's policy-making and overblown charicatures of  current celebrities, respectively. Don't get me wrong, there's a lot wrong with both of those factions of America, but it just seems out of place in this book. I can almost hear the author saying \\"Oh-ho-HO, they got THEIR comuppance!\\" It really distracted me from the overall feel of the book. Other than these two grating sections, I think that Max Brooks has created a truly believable world in which humanity was nearly wiped out by zombies, and I still look forward to any possible Zombie books that Mr. Brooks may pen.
B001U887LK|4|They are so comfortable that I wear them almost all of the time. They are good in the rain too.
B000HBK3MM|4|This is by far the most seductive album of the summer.  Though the single \\"put your records on\\" is a great uplifting track, I think the hidden secret of this album is \\"Til it happens to you.\\"  Her voice is so enrapturing and her lyrics have some definite weight to them.  With many female vocalists out there, it's refreshing to find one that has such poise and grace throughout her entire album.  If you like Corinne's smooth sounds also check out Gretchen Lieberum and her new release \\"Siren Songs,\\" a hidden gem in the female vocal world.
B00005RFAI|5|Pink has managed to rise above the one-hit wonder status and prove a loy of people wrong and bring us a follow up album that is better then her debut.  Missunderstood, is a step forward and scompletely different from her roots, and she has done it with style.  My favourites tracks are Get The Party Started, Just Like A Pill, Numb, Dear And Diary and Respect.  This album is worth having and if you didnt get it for christmas thn i recommend that you go out and buy it
B003EV6DBW|5|Having witnessed how awesome a Doctor Matt Smith makes after watching the 2nd half of series 6, I decided to start from his beginning (although to be honest, it was the only set of the new series in my price range).  But thank you Amazon, for putting this on sale.  It was one of the best $20 I've ever spent in my whole life.  This season is just excellent, for the most part.  Here's a review of each episode:<br /><br />The Eleventh Hour:  The newly regenerated Doctor has 20 minutes to save the world and only Amy Pond can help him. If you can get past the overly long & very stupid scene where he tries food, this episode is awesome.  It's worth it just for the scene where The Doctor confronts the Atraxi.  A<br /><br />The Beast Below:  The Doctor Takes Amy to a distant future, where she finds all of Britain in a giant spaceship.  This is the sort of story I became to expect toward the end of series 6.  It's a very interesting one-off story with a great ending.  A<br /><br />Victory of the Daleks:  The Doctor is summoned to blitz torn London by Winston Churchill - and the Daleks are waiting for him!  This is something of a miss.  For the most part it's good, but the Daleks escaping at the end sort of ruins it.  B-<br /><br />The Time of Angels:  Don't blink - the Doctor hunts the last of the Weeping Angels through the terrifying Maze of the Dead.  I had not seen Blink before I saw this episode, but that didn't keep me from finding it excellent.  A+<br /><br />Flesh and Stone:  Surrounded by an army of Weeping Angels, the Doctor & his friends must escape through the forest.  This is another excellent episode, making this one of the greatest 2 part stories in the new show.<br />A+<br /><br />Vampires of Venice: Dessicated corpses and terror in the canals - the Doctor takes Amy and Rory to 17th Century Venice.  This is a great episode with one of the best monsters of the week and some very funny moments.  A<br /><br />Amy's Choice:  It's been 5 years since Amy saw the Doctor, and when he reappears, she faces a terrible choice.  This is an incredibly good episode that keeps you guessing.  A+<br /><br />The Hungry Earth:  The most ambitious drilling project ever reaches far below the Earth's crust - but the ground is fighting back.  The nadir of the season, perhaps even of the whole new series.  Everyone acted stupidly.  Seriously, I can't think of any single episode worse than this one.  F<br /><br />Cold Blood:  The Earth faces the dawn of a new age of harmony, or the start of its final war.  It's more of the same idiotic writing as the first.  The ending, or rather everything from when the crack showed up, was excellent but that does not make up for the preachy & stupid story.  This is by far the worst 2 part episode in the new show.  D<br /><br />Vincent & the Doctor:  The Doctor & Amy Pond meet Vincent Van Gogh, and help him fight a monster.  Aside from how they suddenly felt sad when the beast died, this was an excellent episode.  A<br /><br />The Lodger:  The Doctor must solve the mystery of the staircase that people go up, but never down.  This episode was a disappointment to me.  I loved the second episode with Craig, & thought the first one would be as good.  There's far too much stalling and not enough good comedy, but the central idea was good.  C-<br /><br />The Pandorica Opens: The Doctor's friends unite to send him a terrible warning - the Pandorica is opening.  Only one word can describe this episode: epic.  Everything from this season really came together.  This also had one of the top 10 most suspenseful cliffhangers in Doctor Who ever.  A+<br /><br />Big Bang: The last hope for all reality is a little girl who still believes in stars...  The series finale continues to rock.  This is the best 2 part story I've seen of the whole series so far, & this part is the best one of the season.  A+<br /><br />So, it came to basically 2 dollars for every outstanding episode (9), and 2 dollars extra for the special features.  Definitely a great deal.  Matt Smith is definitely one of my top 3 Doctors (along with Tom Baker & David Tennant) and this was a great season, even if there were a few duds.  I look forward to seeing the rest of series 6 & series 7.
B00AREIAI8|4|Family loves this app. My daughter is a horse lover and this is her favorite<br /> game. We love how easy it is and the lesson of taking care of a horse.
B00FVVR2ZO|3|This game is cute and is okay if you are just passing the time. I have played better hidden object games. Thanks and have fun!
0062513346|5|This book really helped me to see how there are forces at work in our lives that we do not know about.  Coelho has made me believe through this simple story that God is still present with us everyday, and active in our  lives.  He is not religiously pushy, however, like some writers in this  genre.  He leaves a lot of room for the reader to make his own  interpretation of what is presented, broadening the prospective audience.  This simple story of Coelho and his wife's quest renewed my faith in a lot  of things.  I had mixed thoughts about reading a religiously focused book  when I picked up The Alchemist a few months ago, but the message therein  really helped me put a lot of things into perspective, and Valkyries was no  different.
B005R32L66|4|This works well on my Kindle HD.  Its not hi res like my laptop, but I didn't expect it to be.  It serves its purpose when I don't have access to my laptop & want to video chat with my grandson.  I recommend Skype for Kindle HD if you want to be even more mobile with video chats.
B001KT6JPA|4|In terms of plotlines nothing new to be found here bit at the hands of Ridley Scott and an amazing cast...everyone, from leads to supporting...it becomes an more than enjoyable thriller. The music from Hans Zimmer adds an additional facet of mystery, intrigue and romance and I actually went out and purchased the soundtrack at some point after. Really loved this film.
B001N1DPDE|4|This knife is one sturdy hunk of metal.  The knife arrived with a better edge than expected and is well balanced as a chopping tool.  The scabbard it came with is fair and will do the job for most until something better hits the market or a custom rig is purchased.  The handle scales are the only real weak point.  While comfortable, there is no grip surface to ensure positive control of the tool while wet.  Becker does offer micarta scales after market and adding a set of those to the knife helped remedy the wet grip concern.  All together this is an excellent all purpose outdoor knife.
B00JLJ6MY4|5|He is amazing
0765348276|4|Overall, I liked the book. The writing a little on the basic side and I was a getting a little bored between 1/2 to 3/4 of the way of the way through the book, but then toward the end, it really got good. That last part really made the book for me. It ended in a way that was satisfying, not feeling like a sequel was necessary, but left open the possibility for more.
B00B769XB8|5|I really enjoyed this movie.  It is purely for entertainment and I was entertained.  It was worth watching more than one time.
B002QCAXOS|4|I like this movie better than the remake. The soundtrack is wonderful and so is the scenery.
B00005YUPO|4|Not as good as Mozart, better than Solieri.<BR>Seriously, this is a good video.  It has less music than does the Baby Mozart DVD, and it isn't as good as holding my daughter's attention, even though the format is the same.  What can I say, I prefer Mozart as a composer also.  Still, it is a nice diversion and a good introduction to classical music.
B007IXWKUK|2|predictable/redundant and incredibly far fetched.  Every poor down on her luck always finds a filthy rich guy.  Like that ever happens....
B000ICLRIE|3|I WATCHED THIS DVD FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR.  THE SETTINGS WERE AMAZING AND THE CLARITY WAS ABOVE REPROACH. HOWEVER, THE BACKGROUND MUSIC WAS SO OVERWHELMING THAT I HAD TO REDUCE MY VOLUME ON A STATE OF THE ART HEADSET.    THE HORSES APPEARED TO RUN OFF THE SCREEN AND INTO MY LIVING ROOM.    ALAS, I ONLY HAD A VAGUE IDEA OF WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT. TRUE THE SOUND QUALITY WAS ALL THAT WAS PROMISED, THE DIALGOE WAS IFFY.  AT TIMES I WOULD GET A VAGUE IDEA WHAT WAS SAID AND OTHER TIMES I JUST SAT THERE LIKE A DUMMY WITH NO IDEA WHAT WAS BEING SAID. AT THAT TIME I CALLED IT A NIGHT AND CHECKED THE PACKAGE AND NOTED THAT IT CONTAINED SUB TITLES, WHICH I WAS UNAWARE OF WHEN I STARTED PLAING THE DVD.    I HAVE NOTICED LATELY THAT THERE ARE OTHER DVD'S, BOTH BLU RAY AND OTHERS THAT ALSO SUFFER FROM THE POOR QUALLITY SOUND OF THE SPOKEN DIALOGUE.    INFORMATIVELY, I HAVE THE ENTIRE SET OF THE DIANA RIGG/JOHN STEED AVENGERS THAT RAN FROM 1965-1967. WHEN I PLAY THESE DVD'S THE SOUND QUALIITY OF THE SPOKEN WORD IS AS CLEAR AS CRYSTAL AND IN MY OPINION THE OVERALL SOUND QUALLITY OF THIS COLLECTION IS FAR SUPERIIOR OR WOULD MATCH THE BEST OF HIGH DEFINITION DVD'S.    LASTLY, I WOULD HUMBLY RECOMMEND THAT THE FOCUS SHOULD BE ON THE SPOKEN DIALOGUE AND SOFTEN THE OVERWHEMING AND OVERPOWERING BACKGROUND MUSIC.    THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE I HAVE AT HAND IS TO CHOOSE THE SUB TITLES FEATURE WHICH SADLY IS NOT AVAILABLE ON OTHER DVD'S THAT REALLY WOULD PROFIT BY IT.    HOWEVER, TO THOSE WHO ARE FORTUNATE TO HAVE HEARING THAT MATCHES DOGS OR  BARN OWLS THEN THIS DVD IS FOR YOU.    ROBERT LYONS  RENO, NEVADA
B00CATSONE|1|If you want a very short plot summary of Tesla's life, with a weak intro about how imagination is important for success, then by all means, get this book...
1933633867|5|When I was linked this book on Amazon, I wasn't sure what to expect. I originally saw it as a history of debt, but the book is much more than that - it's an explanation of debt in a broader historical context, something that, as far as I know, has never been done before.     The book is very accessible, and breaks down difficult to understand ideas (for me, modern monetary theory) into piece-by-piece explanations that end up giving you a greater understanding than anything else I've come across. Everybody should read this book, and I hope that Mr. Graeber gets the recognition he deserves.
B000N3T0DW|5|Penélope Cruz is outstanding in this film; her co-stars are all first rate as well.  Carmen Maura is a wonderful actress who works so well with Cruz.      There are lots of surprises along the way.  There are many funny moments as well as intensely dramatic scenes.  All are very well acted.  Penélope sings the tango \\"Volver\\" in the style of a Spanish \\"copla\\" with guitar accompaniment; it is truly wonderful.    This is a film that I will watch again and again.  ¡VOLVER!
B00FPH6A70|4|I watched this on my laptop with the lights on and it was till pretty damn scary.  It was much more bloody then I thought it would be.  I usually steer clear of demon possession flicks because it's such an overdone theme and it's hard to do them well but this one scored with good acting (especially Vera Farmiga), decent script, and a genuinely creepy atmosphere.  I'd also add that the sound effects really took center stage in this film and made it as scary as it was.  I do wish they'd do away with the &#34;based on a true story&#34; angle though; it's just become such a hokey gimmick.  If you're a hardcore horror fan--which I am not-- The Conjuring should score at least an average rating.  I can only handle a horror film once and awhile because I do scare easy.  So from me, an above average rating.  Now time for a comedy but nothing too juvenile because those are a dime a dozen.  Anyone have any suggestions?
B004EBT5CU|5|What can I say? I love her voice, and this CD is awesome. I hope she is around for years! What talent!
B00881VLCE|5|Hours of fun and challenges!

B00GCBL6OU|5|Amazing movie you have to buy the movie it's awesome
B00CHSPB8Y|5|Awesome adictive game. Graphics are terrific for a tablet game .  A little confusing on upgrades and buying new armors. In all purchasing a little expensive but it is possible to play and progress without it.
B005G4TJI4|5|THe young man I bought this for as a Christmas gift has watched this twice already since receiving it.  Thank you Amazon
B002NN5F7A|2|Even though there were so great actors in this movie. I thought it was boring and fell asleep. Maybe I will try it again.
6305971935|3|First of all, I enjoyed the movie.  It was entertaining and a good Sci-Fi story.  What made it bad was Nancy Allen.  When I see her on the screen I get an old \\"B\\" movie feeling about her acting.  Michael Par&eacute; is okay as an actor but can be dull, he always has that bad boy edge to him, which I enjoy watching.  He makes the movie bearable.<br /><br />I loved Final Countdown and thought this was a remake or possibly an old script someone found and decided to try it again.  What made this one different and more interesting was the military (bad guys) twist with the developement of yet another weapon and the results of that endeavor.  A comment on the early nuclear bomb tests that went on and left many military men dead or poisened.  Much of it hidden yet in secret documents.  In Final Countdown, the results of unethical teasting were very interesting.<br /><br />If you are looking for a fun time with a bowl of popcorn on a Saturday Night.  This could work.  Cheers....

B00005RY7X|5|First time I heard of andrew w.k. was on mtv with his music video party hard.<br />The rest was history. Bought the album when it came out. every song on the cd is great.<br />Can't wait for the special re-issue edition to be released on July 17, 2012.
B00112FUH4|5|I've purchased a few of these now for my niece who is almost 4. She enjoys animals and little figurines so these toys fit her perfectly. The animal figurines are solidly made and have some nice detail to them. Its a nice add on item to get my niece something and defiantly a good price for the product.

B0001MDQ2G|5|Raging black/death metal, melodic passages filled with acoustic guitars and piano, female vocals, chanting choirs, exotic instruments/percussion, cool lyrics in multiple languages, and overal jaw-dropping compositions all make \\"Mabool\\" one of the best metal albums of recent times and beyond.  And to think, it's only a debut!  These boys from the Middle East have a promising future indeed.  For any fan of metal that goes above and beyond, this album is an absolute must.  I am certain that \\"Sahara\\" will be incredible as well.
0393061310|3|I finished Jared Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs and Steel. I did so only by skimming a lot  of the later chapters. Did you read every line? It is an awfully large book and I just didn't feel like  plugging along through every portion. As to the depth of material, I had two thoughts.    1) I was most impressed by how much material he brought together. One example was     his lengthy description of the populating and the populations of the islands in the     southeast Asia (e.g., Australia, New Guinea). Another was his almost-as-lengthy      description of the various peoples of China. Although I skimmed a lot of this, I now     know where I can go to get a lot of historical information on peoples of the world     (Europeans, Asians, Americans). I know from my attempts at writing my book that it     takes an enormous effort to find and bring together this much material.    2) On the negative side, the mass of information made it hard to follow his main points - that     elements other than genetic differences caused some areas of the world to progress faster     than others. Out of all of his material, however, I understood:      a) Europe had more large animals (pigs, horses, cattle) to domesticate;      b) Europe had more high-value plants (wheat, barley, peas) to domesticate;      c) Europe is laid out along lines of latitude so that plants and animals domesticated       in one part can be then transplanted to other parts (North and South America       are laid out along lines of longitude - plants and animals viable in one part       may not be viable in another; and      d) because Europeans developed in long contact with a lot of domesticated animals, they       were exposed to many diseases (small pox) and had a degree of immunity that       was lacking in other areas such as the Americas.    3) a-d are important points but I think it would have been easier to have absorbed them if the     book was 1/2 as big - it was awfully hard to dig out these points because most of the time     you are slogging through other matters.    4) Diamond made it quite obvious that he felt these points where why Europe developed faster     than other areas and he made it equally obvious that he rejected the notion that it had anything        to do with intelligence or adaptability.       On the last point, I'm not convinced. As I understand it, he feels that New Guineans, American Indians  or Australian Aborigines could have done the same as Europeans had they had a-d as did the Europeans. However,  I think it is pretty obvious that people of American Indian descent have, to this day, failed to mould into modern  society - they are missing in the Universities, missing in high-tech businesses - they tend to stick to reservations.  From what I know, the same it true of Australian Aborigines and, the last I looked, not much modern production  or innovation comes from New Guinea. On the other side of the coin, I believe it apparent that orientals (e.g., Chinese)  have notable aptitude in the sciences and engineering. So although one does not like to believe that some peoples  are more capable in the modern technological world than others, I believe it is a fact.    I do believe that what has given America its prominent position in the world, is a lot of land to develop  in, separation from older countries, and a substantial mix of peoples.
B00RVC3YKI|5|This is a tour de force. I don't expect anyone will ever do this again. There's no real plot, only real life depicted realistically. &#34;Boyhood&#34; is a must-see. I think it should have gotten an Academy Award in 2015.
B00D7Z4GQY|3|Took a while to keep track of all the characters but did eventually settle into the story. A good read but not full on intrigue.
B008HK3XU4|4|I didn't need anything fancy, just something to protect my Kindle. This works fine and was the right price. Kindle fits well in it.

B003XCVQ3C|1|This worked to deliver video and audio from a 2010 MacBook and a 2011 MacBook Air to our HDTV. However, it stopped working after a few months of regular use. I chose this over cheaper options because it was recommended by Apple and I figured it was worth the money to get a quality product. I was therefore disappointed and angry that it broke so quickly. It's expensive, but it is NOT a quality product. I will try a cheaper one now instead.
B00N35P5MW|5|Love the app
B009UX2YAC|5|I love this game. I'm a mom of 4 and grandma of 2 and this is my stress reliever.

B008M36EEI|1|One star is too much. The only feeling that all those good actors could transmit was the embarrassment of being involved in that movie . I hope that they donated their earnings to charity...in that case I give 5 stars. The only good part was the ending, because it happened.

B0001XAS1M|5|WOW! What an album. This album is fantastic and made Meat Loaf a living legend aswell as spawning some of the most memorable and recognised songs ever. It was 'Bat out of hell', 'You took the words right out of my mouth', and `Paradise by the dasboard light `and' Two out of three ain't bad' which made an unlikely superstar out of Meat Loaf.   Every single song on this album is fantastic and it's been a while since I've actually heard an album that doesn't contain a single 'album filler'. This is why the album has lasted as long as it has. It's is one of the biggest selling albums of all time and has stayed it the UK charts for more than 474 weeks (That's over 9 years!). Bat out of hell was #36 in the US music charts in 1990 thirteen years after its release! And has sold over 35 million copies worldwide and is still selling today.     Meat Loaf is known as the Pavarotti of rock and this album really shows off his operatic, bombastic, over the top and theatrical style of music. This album is vital to anyone's music collection and if you haven't got a copy yet, it is well worth getting. I'm a huge Meat Loaf fan but I do not lie when I come to reviewing his music. Personally I think this album is an absolute masterpiece and is the proof that Meat Loaf is still, larger than life... and always will be.

B00138H0H4|5|I really enjoy this album.  Brandi Carlile can really belt it out.  She imbues the emotionality into her amazing vocals.  Two thumbs up.
0684874350|5|Read slowly or ration the daily page consumption so the book doesn't end so soon.  I purchased the book after hearing an NPR interview.  I loved hearing McCourt relate stories of his childhood and wanted to experience  more of his story-telling style.  Glad I did!  Angel on the 7th step is an  enduring image.  Having been in areas, years ago, similar to McCourt's  Limerick, I found the grimness and perserverence very believable.  His  stories caused me to share some childhood reminiscenses of my own(however  not so dour) with my children.  If a book can generate conversations  exploring one's personal history with those who can carry it forward - good  work!  I look forward to the next edition of the McCourt family.
B00IEBE7GK|5|I saw someone else say that the game was fun and so I downloaded the first one and played it first. The second one picks up right where the first one leaves off. Both games were great. They take a bit of time so you don't feel like you paid too much. The game was challenging at points but there are great hints as you go through.<br /><br />I hope they make another version of this soon

0385342039|1|I was really hoping for a good novel but was hugely disappointed. The characters are so annoying, the plot is so predictable. I basically skipped many of the pages towards the end hoping it would get better, but it got excruciatingly worse so I wanted to end the pain fast.
B008GJVEZ2|5|Rapid-fire dialogue in various accents (brogue, mobster) plus intricacies of plot in which you have to catch every word and name compel me to recommend you turn on CC or English subtitles. If this feature is unavailable to you, watch it with someone and prepare to rewind at times. But it's worth it. This movie is deemed a classic for a reason.<br /><br />I won't repeat what many have said here. It's a nuanced film that will reward repeat watchings. It was fun playing English teacher and tracking recurring motifs.
B000PXUA5W|5|My son loves the watch and we can expand the band as he gets bigger so he can wear it for years to come.
B0000DD7LB|5|Short Story ahead! You've been warned :-)    So, I'm a musician (mainly guitarist and vocalist). I play in jam sessions, or as a street musician in the city or at parties, et cetera.    For years I was in the Prog/Metal world, a la: Pink Floyd, Queen, Queensrche, Metallica, Dream Theater, Apocalyptica, Iron Maiden.     Normally at those parties or street sessions I performed mainly popular tunes by the bands I just mentioned, like Nothing Else Matters (Metallica), Money (Pink Floyd), Bohemian Rhapsody (Queen), you get the idea.    But my repertoire would've been better if I just had some real mainstream songs in it. And now I'm not bashing mainstream or anything. I actually started becoming a musician because of Britney Spears back in 1999, I just stopped listening to pop ever since I started listening to Queen and Metallica (and all the other non-mainstream music).    But so, I thought: Britney Spears. Why not put her in my repertoire? I already know quite her music from her first album back in 1999, I thought.  So I checked this CD: In The Zone. To my surprise it's very different! Although (as quite many others mentioned) her voice seems to be more mature, it sounds as if she doesn't have that 'power' she had in her earlier music. I already heard both 'Me Against The Music' and the brilliant 'Toxic', but a song like \\"Breath On Me\\" is (to me) so fresh and new. I like this 'dance' music.  And \\"Brave New Girl\\"? 'What the heck is this?', I asked myself the first time I heard it. She sounds like Avril, no kidding!    Me Against The Music is worth mentioning as well. I saw the clip when it was aired for the first time here in Holland (yes, I did want to SEE Britney :-P), and the song is interesting in many ways. Rhytmically it's quite tough, especially the very fast \\"I'm up against the speaker, tryin' to take on the music It's like a competition, me against the beat. I wanna get in the zone, I wanna get in the zone.\\" and \\"If you really wanna battle, saddle up and get your rhythm Tryin' to hit it, you could die, In a minute I'm a take a you on, I'm a take a you on\\" parts. And try to play the guitar part along with the singing (like I did), TOUGH TOUGH TOUGH.    Everytime is a beautiful song. And just because it's Britney people hate it (I'm talking about the non-Britney fans). It's quite like My Immortal at parts (though My Immortal is a KILLER SONG, I give you that). Of course, it could've have been stronger if a more skilled singer would sing it, but it's still a great song with Britney.    And my favourite track: Toxic!!!  It's perfect! I really like the \\"I'm addicted to you, don't you know that I'm toxic!\\" part. It's so catchy, the lyrics are deep and the \\"James Bond like\\" guitar in the background makes this a funky piece of music. I love the clip as well. The way she dancewalks in the apartement after having climbed the windows (you know the part where she's got that cape), it flows so well in the music.    Now I know Britney didn't write the songs (I mean musically, not lyrically), but so what? Elvis didn't write all of 'his' music, either.    She's a true performer, and that's what an artist is all about. So she may lip-sing her live shows, she for sure can dance. And all this bashing saying her singing is corrected in the studio is in many cases wrong. Yes, you can correct a wrong sung note, but you WILL notice it. She obviously (or maybe not) did many takes of a song and cut and paste the best parts, but many rock, metal and other pop bands all do that too. She did need to sing them in tune, though. It's not like that she could sing as out of tune as possible and let the computer does all the work, it doesn't work that way.   Yes, technically she doesn't really pop out, but she can sing.    Hmm, maybe I'm becoming a Britney fan, who knows. *checks 'Oops! I Did It Again' and 'Britney'*
B00HHJOH2Y|2|I saw the movie with my boy and was definitely disappointed. The expectations were high after the first part, this one is not funny, not really smart and just boring. If there is nothing else to see, go ahead, but I don't recommend spending money for this movie.
B0097GVJWQ|4|so cool but when I download it it was so slow and it made everything else slow but when I play it the battery dies faster
B0069G5Z9K|4|I notice when playing this that the game will randomly slow down and speed up like it is lagging or something. Also, I think the hog goes too fast and needs to be slowed down because I'm sure it's not good for your eyes to try to focus on something moving that fast. Otherwise, awesome game!!!!!:-)
B00IINPXLW|5|i just now got to play this game i loved the first one and i love this one even more
B0071XO8RA|2|Too depressing for me. When I got to the end of the first one, I couldn't bear to think about reading another. I guess I prefer my endings to be less of a bummer.
B007URVZJ6|4|This guide is very helpful- I wish I had read it before I started building my book for Kindle.  It's easy to read and follow.  I think it would be most helpful for those who are using the latest edition of Word.

0060273224|5|The world created by Garth Nix is both creative and captivating.  From the beginning with a mysterious stranger, to the end with a heroic final missive from Sabriel, tearing your eyes away from the page is the hardest thing you'll ever do!

B009329ZF2|3|My 9-yr-old grandson selected this movie and he was happy with it -- just enough action to hold his attention.  I enjoyed seeing the variety of ships in our naval fleet.
B00BVYNSLC|2|The poster looks great, even the description. But I have to say that the story line is lacking and I was very bored watching it unfortunately.
B008220D5K|3|While this movie says it's about being 40, what it is really about is a modern family with all the struggles and difficulties of being a parent today. There is so much here that I found true to life that I was actually uncomfortable at times because of how on target it was. The teen daughter's plotlines are particularly spot on. The younger daughter steals every scene she's in. Their relationship is perfect. The parents' lack of personal time, the way they exist in the same space but aren't connecting, and the way they interact with their children are fascinating insights into today's parenting. All of this rings true and there were numerous laugh out loud moments for both myself and my wife as we watched this.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the director/writer isn't satisfied with simply poking fun at the family he has to do so with an overabundance of foul language and inappropriate situations. One reviewer said that there was no subtlety here and they were correct. There is nothing insinuated, which is a great way to tell a story; leaving it up to us to draw the conclusions and connect the jokes. Instead it's all in your face and so obvious that it's no longer funny, but mostly uncomfortable. If the movie started out hilariously, it hits this midway point where very little fun (or laughter) happens and that section lasts all the way to the end.<br /><br />This is an insightful writer who instead of sharing those insights with humor decided to throw the insights and all the terrible in-poor-taste jokes in our faces for so long it just got old. I can't positively recommend any part of movie other than the first 30 minutes and even that I have to say it isn't for those who prefer not to hear every kind of terrible curse word (out of even young childrens' mouths!) and other sundry references.<br /><br />This is not 40. This is mediocre, trashy humor that completely ruins the truth that should have been the focus.
B000002UAC|5|Yes &quot;With The Beatles&quot; is (like everything else in the<BR>Fab Four's catalog&quot; is a hands down classic.But what makes this<BR>album special is Lennon/McCartney's early channeling of vintage<BR>Motown,show tunes and British skiffle into an enthusiastic fusion<BR>of rocking beats and hard rhythm and blues.&quot;All My Loving&quot; even has some similarities to old Tin Pan Alley tunes and the old<BR>standard &quot;'Til There Was You&quot; is given the doo-wop treatment.But<BR>it's John Lennon's explosive take on Barrety Strong's &quot;Money&quot;<BR>that just tares the house down  in fine &quot;Twist And Shout&quot; style.<BR>So why would this inspire a mainia consisting largly of teenagers?First of all because these four had fun,lively personality's that came off in their music and because they made<BR>the music their parents or older siblings listen to sound hip and<BR>cool to them.And that,my friends,is why The Beatles are such an<BR>important and mabye over anylyzed group and why I'm so sad that<BR>because of two deaths these guys will never come back together.<BR>WE NEED THE CULTURAL STIMULATION!!!!!!!!
0596007124|3|The trouble with computer/development books is they are so darn expensive. I was able to locate this one at a reasonable price, the seller shipped it quickly, and I am happy with the purchase. The only comment I have on the book, is this copy came from a public library (stamped inside) and as such the front/back covers are a little beat. I'm sure if this copy were used by just a person this wouldn't be the case, but I suppose live and learn on what a 'used book' really means, right? Overall I am satisfied and would do business with the seller again... after all you shouldn't judge a book by its cover, and this one was a bargain for what its teaching me.

1594746168|4|I received this book as an Early Reviewer LibraryThing giveaway in exchange for an honest review. It's actually two books in one; the first is a biography of Dr. Spencer Black, a man who turned his medical genius to the creation of hybrid beasts, and the second is a bestiary of all those creatures he created through the dark surgeries he conducted. I really enjoyed this read. It has a delightful old school feel telling the tale of a mad scientist raised by a grave robber who becomes a carnival showman and descends into madness. Hudspeth's prose is a delight, and the anatomical drawings are gorgeous. My main regret is that the collection of drawings in the ARC I received was not complete.
B005LAIIMG|5|I really like the story, and the scary characters were not too scary, so its a good movie for kids as well as grown ups.

B00003CXBK|5|I was one of the people who complained bitterly when this DVD was originally released w/o a Japanese track and English subs.  I loved the movie visually but hated, hated, hated the English dubbing and refused to buy the DVD. Thanks to Chasemouse, I have checked the specs again and now see that there is a Japanese track, so I have ordered the DVD.
B006HL9G10|5|This is very simple and straightforward app, which is exactly what I want and expect from a meditation app.<br /><br />Spot On - Sounds Just Like My Real Tibetan Bells<br /><br />I use the Now & Zen Tibetan Phone Bell and Timer, which replaces your telephone's ring with an actual Tibetan bell. I also have several Tibetan singing bowls, and also CDs here at home, so I can say with total confidence that the sounds in this app are spot on, and sound completely authentic to my ear.<br /><br />The Mechanics of Vibration<br /><br />So part of the experience when meditating with Tibetan bells, is the actual physical vibration emanating from the bells. The idea being, at least in part, is to harmonize one's inner state with the physical vibrations and sound waves being produced by the bells. Naturally, this app can only replicate part of that experience, since there is no actual bell physically in the room. However, modern times call for modern alternatives to scaling a mountainside and meditating in the earth's apex with the singing bells of Tibet. So, for those days when you simply don't have the time to make that lofty trek, just pull out this app, and meditate on the spot with these authentic sounding bells.<br /><br />Nice Selection<br /><br />Choose between 7 bells of different sizes and tones. All the bells are pictured and you can listen to samples before setting up your session or timer. In addition to the 7 bells, there's also a set of wooden blocks that also sound nice.<br /><br />Timers<br /><br />Set the desired length of your session; hours, minutes, seconds, or any combination thereof. Set between 1-3 bell rings for each strike. Choose separate beginning and interval bells. Save multiple presets so you can easily chose one that suits your needs.<br /><br />Insight Connect<br /><br />Is a global meditation network. See a live map of the world, pinpointing all the people meditating at that precise moment around the world. Join in and harmonize yourself with the world. Meditate with friends, or make new ones. Focus together on a global scale. Change yourself, and maybe even the world.<br /><br />Journals<br /><br />Add journal entries about whatever you wish to jot down at that moment; thought for the day, goals, intent, whatever you like. You can even export your journal entries and email them to yourself. I have Epson iPrint, so that also gives me the option of printing out my journal entries straight off my phone or tablet.<br /><br />Other Cool Stuff:<br /><br />> Custom Images - set a custom image to appear when your timer starts. Choose something that helps set the mood or focus your intention.<br /><br />> Hide Display - blank out the screen if you don't want it on while meditating; conserves battery and eliminates a potential distraction. The timer and sounds are still functional. Just touch the screen to get it to come back on.<br /><br />> Timer Message - appears when the session is complete. Set it to a personal affirmation.<br /><br />> Social Media - have a post sent to FB or Twitter automatically so friends know you're meditating and can join you, or know to contact you later when you're done.<br /><br />> Prompt for Journal Entry when session concludes - makes it easy to remember to do it.<br /><br />> Vibration - can vibrate with bell sounds or by itself with no bell sounds, depending on your environmental needs.<br /><br />> Do Not Disturb - Mute all other phone or tablet sounds while the timer is active<br /><br />> Charts & Stats - view info about your sessions. Very interesting.<br /><br />A Word About Permissions<br /><br />I'm really picky about permissions and often don't install apps if I feel they are needlessly invasive. The permissions for this app appear to be related to the group meditation options and social networking features. Location, accounts, etc.<br /><br />No Crashes<br /><br />Everything runs smoothly, both on my phone and tablet. Menus are snappy and respond well. Everything is welllaid out and easy to follow. Plus there's well written and detailed instructions on all the features.<br /><br />Bottom Line - clearly this app was created by people who use it themselves. This is very well thought out and executed. Very nicely done. Like it a lot. Best one of its kind I've personally tried. Happy! ;oDlaid out and easy to follow. Plus there's well written and detailed instructions on all the features.<br /><br />Bottom Line - clearly this app was created by people who use it themselves.

B004UJTG6Q|4|After reading Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer one can see the difference. Train's writing is polished and more refined in Huck Finn yet beautiful. Tom Sawyer while very enjoyable seems to be a writer on his way to mastering his craft. Huck Finn he's arrived.
B00969GFFU|3|Took me a while to work my way through this book--some of it out of pure pleasure and some of it because of drudgery.  I found the central story quite interesting and enjoyed the character development, but it felt like Franzen had a list at his side while writing of topics he wished to address.  At times he makes wonderful points by showing them through the action of the characters and the story, but once you get in the core of the book, the writing just gets lazy and he simply starts telling us the ideas that he wants to express....rather than developing them through the context of the novel.<br /><br />This feels like a book in need of a serious edit, which apparently it did not receive.  All the political points he wishes to make, where he tells us what he thinks of Bush2 and his cronies adds really nothing to the story in the way it's presented.  Doesn't move the story forward or develop the characters more deeply....these diversions simply provide a platform for Franzen to pontificate.  My disappointment in these parts of the book have nothing to do with any disagreement with what he has to say, but if you hacked all this out of this severely bloated book, it wouldn't affect the story or the characters one bit.  In the end, you'd have a far more taunt read in every respect.<br /><br />Sadly, opportunity missed and a middling 3 star response.

B00A6PD9I4|5|All you haters at the 1's and 2's. This was in the way of a classic folk yarn with simple story and simple values. It was a fun, cute movie and well worth watching. You had me going there, now I am only sad I waited so long to watch it believing you all this time.
B00GOZQ2E8|5|This game is adorable.
B00F7YHDWC|5|Crazy!  Love it.
B003O86FMW|4|I enjoyed it. I Started it immediately after the Hunger Games. It was very exciting, I couldn't put it down.
0767830555|4|This movie was an excellent film with Robert De Niro in it. For all of you DeNiro fans this is his best movie he has EVER BEEN IN. BUY THIS DVD AND WATCH IT ALONE. Go to the store, buy some Goobers, then put this DVD into ur DVD player and watch it 6 times in a row, or watch it until you have memorized the script, and you can be cool like me, and be like &quot;You talkin to me&quot; and then tell all your freinds about how you stayed home alone on a friday night and watched a Robert De'Niro movie and then were shocked by the cool ending. Anyways this is a great movie and any movie fan should buy it. It falls into the drama/art house category by my terms, and is definitly a shocker that is worth every penny.
B00DVKOYBM|4|Great game ! Varied opponents.
B00YB9BLUE|3|Just play the original CD a second time and you're basically hearing the bonus disc.<br /><br />\\"Carouselambra\\" has a longer fade-out that runs about 14 seconds longer.  That's it.  Everything else sounds the same.<br /><br />This whole series of \\"bonus discs\\" have been an extreme disappointment.  Yes, there's been the occasional gem here and there, but those gems would have made up a single disc, rather than all these \\"alternate mixes\\" that sound identical or nearly identical to the original recordings.<br /><br />As it stands, I will rarely (if ever) listen to these bonus discs again.  There is a wealth of great live material out there from every period of Led Zeppelin. Had Page released some of it, I think a lot of fans would have been much happier.

0805047905|4|Classic book. Great size for little ones. My son loves to read this story daily. Pictures are bright and mom adds lib with sound Effects . A &#34;must have&#34; in the baby library. And to personalize it a bit, I added pictures of myself (covering the teacher) and older daughter (among the children). Baby gets a kick out of that.<br />The repetition helps engage the baby.
B00AREIAI8|5|i love this app ;) I'm always playing it.. very addictive.. I recommend this app to everyone especially. thoes who love horses.
B00DBSZEH2|4|Better then expected.
B00005YW4H|1|I really have no clue as to why Norah is so successful.  She doesn't have a good voice, and on top of that, this is one of the most boring albums I have ever heard.  As another person said, her voice really doesn't do the song justice, and she didn't even write it.  The song could have been good if they had given it to someone with a more powerful voice.  Why in the world do critics feel that they need to catre to her?  Well, I simply &quot;Don't Know Why&quot;.  Do not buy this pathetic album, there are so many better songs and albums out there.
B00PTB7B34|5|Great game very fun

B00AREIAI8|4|great game to pass the time and my daughter can't get enough lol. this one is a must have for parents
B0054NQZ9S|1|Amazing star power puts out a pathetically lame movie.  If you want to hear about corporate greed and sad stories for 1 hour and 40 minutes this is the flick for you!  A massive waste of great talent.  Producers may want to pick a script next time not completely based on liberal gibberish!
B008MG1E4A|1|The man who wrote this book won't even use his real name.  That tells you something.  He's a traitor to his comrades in arms as all members sign that they wouldn't reveal info for 17 years.  Do you want the terrorists to learn how our Seal Teams operate?  Well,  this man did just that.<br /><br />If you buy this book,  you are not only supporting him but you are condoning his actions just to satisfy your 'curiosity'.  And you are giving this traitor money for his giving info to the terrorists.
0812548094|5|my son loves his books
B00005A0B7|5|If you enjoy old school R&B that's heavy on the blue notes, you'll bound to like this album. It's mostly all good. Even the less then perfect fidelity can't be faulted because this is rare stuff indeed.
B00OIK4C5C|5|Bought this album cause I had the songs stuck in my head. Love this. Perfect for my walks home and exercising.
B009VB7P6G|5|This was a great movie. One that the entire family will enjoy! Even my teenage daughter liked the movie. My son watched it four or five times!
B00L23SE52|5|Great movie to watch with your kids. There is catchy music and good lessons to learn throughout the whole movie even for adults. If you like building with Legos, then you'll like this movie
B00BAXFECK|2|Starts fine, then becomes a mix of several story lines. It reads as if the author jotted down all the individual stories, then got lazy and decided to string them together. And that did not work well.
B00IRISI42|5|The only fault would be is that there are too many department abbreviations used.  Probably necessary though. Enjoyed the book.
B005K17RU0|4|I use this on kindle fire. No troubles, easy to use, handy little app. I have the free version. I,m in Alaska and work remote jobs so it's a good idea to know what weather to expect!
B00005JLDW|3|This was an enjoyable, well written movie with solid acting and special effects.  Unfortunately, it didn't live up to its full potential.  At an hour and a half (or so), it left me wanting more.  I could easily have enjoyed it at twice the length.  The major problem I had with the film was the fact that, once they discover the first dragon, the movie leaps forward twenty years.  It was that intervening twenty years that I wanted to see more of.  It would have been interesting to see all of humanity come together in a common cause of survival (a la Armageddon).  It would even have been intriguing to get a glimpes of the political maneuvering that occurred, as well.  Unfortunately, all we get of these intervening years is an interior monologue from Christian Bale's character as he writes in his journal.  In addition, the ending, to me, seemed a bit abrupt.  I was expecting some sort of brief summary of the events that took place after the movie involving humanity's continued struggle against the beasts.<br />Despite these shortcomings, the movie was enjoyable in and of itself.  Well written dialogue and intriguing characters held my attention during the lulls in between the action scenes.  Bale and McConaughey stood out among the cast in both their acting and in the definition of the characters themselves.  The post apocalyptic scenario was handled well and was believable.  The struggle to feed survivors and the worry that other enclaves were gone and the fear of marauders gave a feel of authenticity.  The costumes and sets were well done and added vividly to the vision of the creators.  Finally, I have to say that these are some of the best looking dragons on film.  I was highly disappointed in Dragonheart's design...a little to cheesy for me.  These, though, were menacing and frightening.  I just wish we'd gotten to see more (again, the hour and a half playing time comes into play here...there wasn't enough time to develop characters and story as well as mix in moreaction than there already was...oh well).<br />If you're a fantasy fan, then I would recommend you see this in the theaters, just for the chance to view the creatures on the big screen. Otherwise, you may just want to wait for it to be released on DVD.
B001EBWING|5|Casablanca! A film with an unlikely cast which magically came together in this story! The memories of it have lingered with me so that I KNOW it is a classic, by any standards!
B005V2S7FW|5|I love this app.  The free version is very good, the paid version is even better.  It allows you to use the app across several platforms, desktop and mobile.  Saves and protects all my passwords do I don't have to remember which password is for which site.  Will even generate complex passwords, if you want.
B0089LOG02|5|This book has all the elements that I like: interesting story line,  historical accuracy, well-drawn characters, and a satisfying ending.
B002MGIIZE|5|Omg! Can't believe I waited so long to watch this movie. Loved all the twists & turns. Great movie.
0679457607|5|Proposes, defends, and offers detailed first-hand phenomenological insight into a radical (by Western standards) approach to learning that maintains the master skill of all learning is \\"relaxed concentration\\" (p. xiii) coupled with trust in the body's (and mind's) ability to learn. As a sequel to the author's previous work on learning to play tennis, the book provides instruction, examples, and encouragement in becoming receptive to a natural form of learning based on focused attention and non-judgmental awareness. While the approach admittedly can seem somewhat Zen-like to most Westerners, it is consistent with the Socratic learning approach underlying much of classical education. <br /> <br />Oh, and by the way, it WILL reduce your handicap.
B008JFUR10|5|Awesome Movie
B00EMXBDMA|5|A novel advertised as a 21st Century &#34;Robinson Carusoe&#34;, it's very suspenseful and technical at the same time.  An astronaut is stranded on Mars and must survive until a rescue operation can be mounted.  The technical parts aren't too dense for  the layman, and the suspense parts will keep the reader absorbed until the last page.  I hope Mr. Weir continues to write more books -- his writing is excellent and quite entertaining.

0440180295|5|Slaughterhouse-Five is hands down, a genius combination of truth and fiction. Kurt Vonnegut’s famous satirical novel is about violence and war and the idea of free will. It’s an autobiographical and fictional mix built into a story about Billy Pilgrim’s time travels on Earth and his visit to the distant planet Tralfamadore. It was published in 1969, in the midst of the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War and became a best-seller because of its anti-war sentiment. It has been banned from some schools and studied in others and is considered Vonnegut’s most influential work. I think it is excellent in its message, its symbolism and its construction.<br /><br />Vonnegut’s main character, Billy Pilgrim, jumps back and forth through time and tries to make sense of a life that has been dramatically transformed by his experience as an American prisoner during World War Two. Billy wasn’t meant for war, but there he is. His miraculous survival after the Allied bombing and total destruction of Dresden, Germany is a turning point in his life, a moment he struggles, unconsciously, to understand and beat.<br /><br />Billy copes in a way no one around him can understand, by retreating inward and traveling in time, past and future and being kidnapped by aliens from the planet Tralfamadore. Tralfamadorians tell Billy that there is no real end in time. “All moments, past, present, and future, always have existed, always will exist.” They tell him that moments in time are like “bugs trapped in amber.” When Billy notes that life on their planet is peaceful, unlike on Earth, they tell him they, too have experienced violent wars, but they have a way to deal with them. “There isn’t anything we can do about them, so we simply don’t look at them. We ignore them. We spend eternity looking at pleasant moments.”<br /><br />I like everything about this book. Many of characters are symbols of certain types of thought and are precisely depicted through their actions and what they say. When Billy’s daughter, Barbara treats him like a child, I found myself believing in Tralfamadore. When Billy visits his mother at Pine Knoll nursing home, I felt his mother’s tears, as she pulls all her “energy from all over her ruined body, even her toes and fingertips” just to ask Billy, “How did I get so old?” I hated Roland Weary, I felt sad for Wild Bob and the hobo who says, “This ain’t bad. This ain’t nothing at all.” I saw the irony of Edgar Derby’s fate, a teacher of “Contemporary Problems in Western Civilization” and the image of Derby’s face bursting into tears after Billy feeds him a spoon of syrup.<br /><br />This is one of those books that reads quickly and gives the first impression of a story casually told, but it’s not. Every word is carefully chosen, every character is deliberately included, and every jump in time is purposefully choreographed. And despite the graphic descriptions and language and the ugliness of war, this book has a beauty about it that’s hard to describe.<br /><br />While this story is about Billy’s personal struggle, its bigger story and strongest message is about war. I think Vonnegut’s description of the Allied bombing of Dresden in reverse is very powerful:<br /><br />“The formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames. The bombers opened their bomb bay doors, exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires, gathered them into cylindrical steel containers, and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes.”<br /><br />Vonnegut continues this reverse description back to the beginning of man, where eventually, “Everybody turned into a baby, and all humanity, without exception, conspired biologically to produce two perfect people named Adam and Eve.” All that’s complicated and violent, returning to something so simple.<br /><br />It took me a long time to get to Slaughterhouse-Five. I don’t think these ideas will ever leave me.d what they say. When Billy’s daughter, Barbara treats him like a child, I found myself believing in Tralfamadore.

B0041KVYIW|5|Never had this in the British version before. The remastered version is EXCELLENT. What a classic. They were expanding their musical horizons here. Great job.
0345803485|5|I wasn't expecting to like this series, but i found it a good pool/beach book.  The storyline was interesting from the beginning and it made me want to keep reading the series.

B006MW3V6U|5|I waited until the third season before deciding to watch this show.  It is done quite well and the acting is very good.

B009AMANH4|5|This is a great movie for anyone interested in the history of the Lincoln presidency and the issues surrounding the Civil War in the United States. As Hollywood usually does, they embellish the details somewhat, but the movie will hold your interest and educate you at the same time.
B001BC2ZS6|5|Great book!!
B0070Z4M4I|2|Slurpy, icky, dumb.  Not quite as stupid as the totally whacked-out, F-minus, retarded, Kurt Russell version (what the heck?), but still pretty disappointing.  It really Tries to become good, at several points - but the whole story line flow is so choppy and the general intelligence of the construction is so floppy, that you just want to stare out the window and throw up.  Now - you want to see an Awesome remake?  Check out Keanu Reaves' \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\" or Tom Cruise's \\"War of the Worlds\\".  THOSE are good movies.  The cretins involved with these \\"The Thing\\" remakes, however, apparently have some weird retardo fixation on big, floppy wormy monster things.  Maybe their daddys made them eat worms as kids when they went fishing as punishment for not catching enough fish?  Or maybe they currently have some sort of spastic colon or duodenumic disease and are tormented at night with intestigut monsters floppily, sloppily attacking them?  Or...maybe their I.Q. is simply minus 74.  Who can know these things?  Maybe they voted for Obama or Clinton and their brains have become half-eaten away as a result of a rare kind of subconscious self-flagellation where they've auto-infected their brains with Amazonian pinworms or something. Which in itself could be good material for a movie.
B00GFOIUVQ|5|I think it was awesome about how the game looks like the movie! It feels like it brings you into the world of Thor.
B00D4LKOVC|4|Great Classic
B000TUXL2A|5|I picked up the CD the day it was released, brought it back work, and listened to it through little tiny laptop speakers, and thought...    \\"Hmmm...no rockers, that's interesting, okay.\\" I only picked up a few of the words, but the low-key melodies grabbed me from that first listen.    When I got home I gave it proper listen with good headphones, I just fell in love with it.    As another reviewer pointed out, the music he's making here is incredibly close to the soundtracks he did back in the `70's and early '80's for \\"Local Hero\\" and \\"Cal\\". All of the tunes on this CD have a very distinct Northern English or Scottish folk music feel.    The songwriting, of course, is perfect. Mark's the best at creating intricate, little short stories that become songs.    And, while I love the pared down studio band this time around, it still sounds incredibly rich to these ears.     Perhaps after dancing around the kitchen to LCD Soundsystem, or listening to the aural density of \\"Sky Blue Sky\\" and \\"In Rainbows\\", it's just great to hear a master doing what he does best with less.
B00AEUPOVQ|4|The script was written well and the acting very good. It is confusing in the beginning if you do not know the back story.
B007BZM3HK|5|Good song, good quality, good music and I love how it links up with all of my amazon mp3 devices!

B00FWLSOOG|1|If I had the option to give this movie a 0 star rating, I wouldn't.  I would give it a single star for the battle scenes.  However, the story, character development, and, well, movie overall was a horrid waste of money and time.
B00E9ZAT4Y|5|This movie is my absolute favorite! I of course recommend it to all families and think it should be in everyone's home.
0525422943|5|I don't usually write reviews, but I will say, this book was an amazing sequel.  The first book tore my heart and I didn't think that it could happen again.  This book had me in pieces!!  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.  It felt so real and full of emotion.
B00CZ7OC46|5|This is more than just a book on Remote work - it's about pragmatism and (not so common) sense.  I wish every corporate exec would read this.
0767827902|5|I found this movie delightful--from the storyline, directing and photography to the actors! I especially loved the performances of Timothy Bottoms and Chloris Leachman!  It's an enlightening movie that makes an important point: sometimes what we think we want is not really what we want at all.
B000HSKUBE|5|Better than USA version.  More believable and realistic.

0142000655|5|In what is truly a masterpiece on many levels, John Steinbeck delivers with East of Eden a compelling tale of two families whose lives in the Salinas Valley are fascinating and seemingly intertwined. This novel began as merely a required piece for school, but as I read on, I found myself unable to put it down, often reading late into the night. The characters are realistic and masterfully tied together, their lives tied together, as if by fate. The plot provokes the mind, raising philosophical questions that opened to me different ways to view the world and choices in life. Steinbeck's story-telling is simply wondrous, saturating the novel with detailed descriptions and narration. The fact that this is the centennial edition, still wildly popular and discussed more than a hundred years after it was written, is testament to the allure of the novel. I would highly recommend this book to anyone, regardless of age, as it is an exploration of some of the most important ideals in our society. Steinbeck even stores the essence of the 601 pages into one word- thimshel, a word as important and essential to the story as carpe diem is to Peter Weir's Dead Poets Society, both tales that have enabled me to view the world in a different light, and help me become a better person as a whole.
0393317552|5|There are hundreds of reviews on here of this monumental book covering the general thesis and finer details.  Suffice to say that the book is extremely powerful and thought provoking.  Whether or not one agrees with Diamond's conclusions, they are well-established and inspire critical thought.  He has presented some of the simplest answers to questions of monumental historical significance, and the scientific presumption should always be that the simplest answer is most likely correct.  While some reviewers slam Diamond as psuedo-Marxist and completely unbalanced, no competing theories of human development are as compelling as his nor as scientifically substantiated to this point.
B00I8PDQ6O|2|A well written anthology but having no more than about 30 pages that anyone could consider even remotely influential on any author, let alone Lovecraft.<br /><br />Most of the book [60%+] is about late nineteenth- to early twentieth-century expat artists in Paris and their Bohemian life, loves, and self-discovery.  The book should really be divided into the first two-fifths, and the second three fifths and sold in two parts which have nothing really to do with each other.  They probably couldn't sell the book that way, which is a pity because unless you have some very parochial interests, or just like reading decent stylists without much plot or action, the second group of stories in this anthology will have no appeal for you whatsoever.<br /><br />As I first wrote, it's well written, with a nice style and some genuinely decent supernatural bits.  But by selling it as some kind of major influence on H.P. Lovecraft, I think the book's promoters have set-up most purchasers for a very big disappointment.

Owen - can there ever be a better man.......I just want to jump up and down and scream to everyone to read this book so I can OMG with them.<br /><br />Favorite book of all time, no kidding.....
B008XBCJ34|1|I purchased this set yesterday. Suprisingly I received this order today.  However, due to coding on the movie, my Samsung 3D Blu Ray player will not play this DVD.  I would NOT order this package until this problem is resolved.  I was very disappointed and am currently working with Samsung to hopefully get past this coding block.

B00JLJ0Y2U|5|Amazing voice and performer!
B000002UB3|5|Although Let It Be was released last, Abbey Road was actually the last album that The Beatles recorded, and that's the way I like to think of it. As the last Beatles album. And how is it? Well, it's pretty good. Actually, scratch that. It's one of the best rock albums in history and, along with The White Album, probably the best album that The Beatles ever released.  <br /> <br />The first song on the album is Come Together, which is a great start, and an excellent song by John. Then there's Something, one of George Harrison's most famous songs. It certainly is one of the best songs of all time, and shows that George was really starting to develop his musical talents, which he would later reveal in full force with his first solo album All Thing Must Pass. Of course, Here Comes The Sun also features on this album, and is also another George favorite. <br /> <br />Also, on side one, we have what is possibly my favorite Beatles song. Definitely up there in the top three. I Want You (She's So Heavy). This is one of these songs that you just never hear anymore. It starts off quite quiet, with a groovy little beat, and then starts getting \\"loud\\". I've always felt that if the apocalypse had to be represented with sound, the last two minutes of this song would sum it up pretty well. It feels as if the world is ending. It's just an amazing, amazing song and ends so abruptly, after seven minutes, that you actually have to take a minute to catch your breath, which is probably why they placed it at the end of side on. <br /> <br />Now, I'm not a Paul hater, but his two songs on the first side of the album are pretty weak. I've always felt that Maxwell's Silver Hammer and Oh, Darling! are sub-par compared to the rest of the first side, which is mostly excellent. Hell, I even like Octopus' Garden.  <br /> <br />What this album is probably most remembered by is the song medley on side two. It's basically a bunch of unfinished songs that John and Paul had lying around, that they melded into one. It's a great piece of work, especially the Golden Slumbers/Carry That Weight/The End sequence. <br /> <br />Overall, this album is a great way to end the wonderful career of The Beatles.
B00SH04286|3|The premise of LUCY is interesting -- what indeed do humans do with the large portion of the brain that is unused? The film gives an interesting insight into what might happen if those idle cells came into play.
B000ILYYJE|5|Awesome boxset, loads of extras, great remastering job and a cool boxset design.  If you want the best fullest versions of the Doors albums here's your set.

0345350499|5|I am quite a Camelot fanatic and loved this book.  In all of the versions of the Arthurian legend that I have read, Guinevere has been portrayed as a strong, self-assured woman who is as diplomatic as Arthur; Morgaine has been portrayed as the King's harlot sister, an evil witch.  The Gwenhwyfar in The Mists of Avalon, to me, seems a lot more realistic.  She is pious and quiet, always wishing to do right by her God and husband.  As much as I am a feminist, this was unfortunatly more typical of women in that era.  As for Morgaine, I found her quite lovable and find myself understanding how some judgements about her might have been formed.  This is an excellent book.  It seems like a much more realistic version of the Camelot story and I find myself both loving and hating each of the characters.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves the Arthurian story.  This is that and so much more.
034580404X|4|Very INTERESTING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This was well written, much to my surprise.  Can't wait to start book two and three.<br /><br />  Author has a great imagination.  WOW !!!!
B003QSI8MU|5|I like the plot of the parent trap.It's a clever remake,as good as the original.My kids (7,and 9) love it!
B0026NBZDU|2|Well I read it cover to cover, so I can't say I hated it. Something made me want to read until the end. However, the pace was too slow - I found myself skimming quite a lot.
B00SH04286|1|Worst movie ever.
B00004T8RK|5|This is an amazing album by pearl jam. They not only have the fast and ferious songs that we all love, but they have the mellow mix in this cd to even it out. Great songs like God's Dice, Evacuation, Breakerfall, Grievance, just to name a few. This is a great pearl jam album that has not been given the credit it diserves.
B00000DFSK|5|The songs picked for this CD were all good choices. With tracks from CDs I practically grew up on, this colection is a winner.
B00BAXFECK|1|The Goldfinch. A beautifully written very boring narrative. The primary characters are persistently intoxicated and/or under the<br />influence of narcotics, acting irresponsibly and stupidly. This talented writer is wasted on this terrible book.

0977326403|5|I purchased this as a request from my son for Christmas. He said he enjoyed reading the book.
B000G759LW|1|I really tried to like \\"Ain't no other man\\"..gave it many listens and just couldn't bring myself to like it...While the instrumentation was interesting and different, her constant oversinging really gets in her way, especially when I know Christina does have a good voice, which is apparant on her other albums. Unfortunely, I didn't even like the only song that had any prayer of being a hit (mentioned above). The other songs on this album are more of the same; oversinging, no restraint to the runs and lack of good hooks to draw the listener in.   <br /> <br />Christina's Stripped album was far better than this, as was her first album.  Christina should be saying her prayers to the MTV fairy for all the publicity which I'm quite sure had a hand in making this album so popular.

B007ZGBZHE|4|Pendergast works for the FBI, but they never seem to be quite on top of what he is doing. He is usually a loner, and only works well with others when he absolutely needs to. This book was a continuation of prior books on his relationship with his wife. She was absolutely gorgeous, but also came from a strange background. It's only when she is kidnapped that Pendergast finds out how strange. Apparently, she was the result of continuing experimentation by Nazis who were settled in South America...they just kept doing what Mendele started. Pendergast loses his wife, but in the process of both retaliation against those who hurt her, and also an ongoing series of murders in New York that seem to be for Pendergast's benefit, Pendergast finds out he has a couple of sons.<br />One of them he needs to find, and the other he needs to 'catch'.<br /><br />This was not the best writing by Preston and Child. Like most series, the authors are either bored with their series and continuing them for fans, or they are writing kind of in 'rote mentality'. I'm not so appalled at the plot which seems far fetched to many readers/reviewers, mainly because stranger things in life happen all the time. And we know (scientists) that various groups are playing around with genetics and stem cells in unethical manners. I am more concerned about the quality of the writing, which seems a little tired, a little bored.<br /><br />But these are 'fun' books, that are worth taking for a light read when at the beach or camping. And for those of us who kind of fall in love with strange characters, it is worth it to see Pendergast again.
B000BJS4OY|5|Hell yes!<br />I just wish it was in a smaller box!<br /><br />The documentary and live dvd are awesome!<br />I feel I missed out on seeing that live concert when it happened...even though I was only 3yrs old and live nowhere near London
B005IQZB14|4|This book is very different from what I normally read, but I enjoyed every page.  It is definitely worth the time.
B00005JPBR|5|The cast and acting are suberb.  The flashbacks are all part of the misdirection and mystery.  Watch closely. <br /> <br />Based at the turn of the 19th to the 20th centuries, when the industrial revolution was converting from steam to electricity.  It mixes magic and science and details the fictional rivlary of two magicians and as a sub-plot the real-life rivalry of two famous inventors of the time. <br /> <br />I have not seen the Illusionist yet, so I can't compare, but as a glorious mystery, it rivals Anthony Shaefer's Sleuth (both the stage and movie version) which curiously, Michael Caine also starred in.
B000HKW7E0|5|Always a favorite this time of year - we even have friends in the UK who love it.
B003TSEEDY|5|Very much enjoyed this book. I think everyone can relate to awkward times in high school and how people deal with it

0812993292|5|We all have heard and perhaps even read about the aging man or woman who late in life decides to take the roadtrip of a lifetime one last time as a form of redemption or self-discovery.  This is such a story, except this is on foot the slow way.<br /><br />The chapters are slow at first but each chapter reveals sometime about the three main characters:  Harold Fry, the just-retired brewery salesman, his wife Maureen, and Queenie Hennessy, with whom Harold worked 20 years ago but who had to abruptly quit her job at the brewery.<br /><br />The book starts out with Harold receiving a letter from Queenie saying she has inoperable cancer.  On a whim, he decides to walk across England to see Queenie one last time.  He leaves behind his wife, who learns only afterwards that he has left to see an old friend.  But why does he walk instead of drive, or get a train or bus ticket?  The constant stays in village B&Bs must surely take a toll on his retirement fund.  The reason for the tortuous walk is revealed on page 86:  \\"In walking, [Harold] freed the past that he had spent twenty years seeking to avoid and now it chattered and played through his head with a wild energy that was its own.  He no longer saw distances in terms of miles.  He measured it with his remembering.\\"  Every subsequent conversation he has with strangers reveals a bit more about his past, his marriage to his wife, and their lives together.<br /><br />There is much bittersweetness to this plot, but it makes for an engaging read, with episodes we all can relate to:  lost love, failed love, sadness, tragedy, humor, understanding, compassion.  Every day that Harold is walking, he meets interesting people and or experiences something that helps him understand himself more.  There's the silver-haired gentleman, a group of cycling moms, the immigrant doctor, and ultimately the \\"new beginning.\\" I've met strange people along my many backpacking and road trips, so there's nothing too unusual about opening up to strangers.  This story reads as if this really happened, and in essence it has happened to all of us.  The end completes the journey both spiritually and physically, and perhaps some will find it satisfying.<br /><br />Rachel Joyce is a talented writer.  This was a very engrossing read.  I am looking forward to more such stories by this gifted author.gers.  This story reads as if this really happened, and in essence it has happened to all of us.

B00DPM7RJW|5|5 stars just because Colleen Hoover wrote it. She is a genius. I loved the story and each charecter. Totally recommended
B0031ES8P6|5|item is great and would definately recommend it to any with a little girl....She fell in love with itand wanted another
B00000DHRX|5|I purchased this cd for my mother. It was in perfect condition. No scratches and I enjoyed that this purchase was for a charity so my money was well spent

B007ZGO7EM|1|Your phone's default calculator will serve you better. It's neat to turn the whole phone into a calculator via the touch screen, but this thing really didn't bring any new features to the table.
B00AK0X5VQ|4|Osmos is one of those games that's easy to learn but has a surprising amount of strategy involved in it.
B000OCY7JE|4|**** 2006. Story and direction by the Danish director Susanne Bier. Nominated for the Academy award in the Best Foreign Language Film category. Jacob Pederson manages an orphanage in Bombay, India. Now, he has to fly home to Denmark in order to meet a potential donor who's also his former girlfriend's husband. With a twirling camera, inherited from the Dogma artistic movement, Susanne Bier handles a very interesting theme: can you make people happy in spite of them ? Can you, like an ancient god, rule people's lives without their knowledge and, most of all, is this interaction morally defendable when good comes of it ? I'll remember for a long time the performance of Rolf Lassgård as Jørgen Lennart Hannson, a man used to be obeyed and who never accepts no for an answer. Highly recommended.
B0074D3CAQ|5|One of the best books I've read this year. Easy read with quality, well developed characters. Good job Rachel Joyce.
B005GFPZYK|4|Would recommend.
B00HXYKYIE|2|I really didn't enjoy this book at all, but I was forcing myself to continue reading it for book club. It does have a strange, surprise ending. Just not my type of book.
B00881VLCE|5|Great game. Customizable for all skill sets.
B005K17RU0|4|Very nice weather app.
B0000AQZYM|5|This movie is hilarious and fun for ages 1 to 91.  Seriously, the whole family can enjoy it.  There's adult humor, but its good clean fun so its not inappropriate for young kids.  The characters are just plain funny, and it reaches people on all sorts of levels.  One of the greatest cartoons ever.
0385732554|2|Young Jonas, eleven and turning twelve, lives in a community of the future where everyone is happy and everyone is the same - to the point that sunshine has been 'edited out' and citizens don't see colors. The young lad is selected to be a keeper of memory, which means that the previous Keeper will give him his memories (by laying hands on him, Vulcan style). These are collective memories, of war, famine, biological families, snow, colors and sunshine (all eliminated from this 'utopian society'). Jonas feels colors and snow, decides they are good, snatches a little baby that was about to be euthanized and heads for the hills, with the blessing of his Keeper. The idea is that as soon as he's gone, the painful memories he had inside would spread out into the community and society would be transformed.<br />  The writing is good, and the ideas sound interesting at first. The intent is fairly clear: this utopia of the future is collectivized, a sort of communism pushed to the extreme. The fact that the book was written during the Cold War tells you all you need to know about the intent and context. But the book ultimately fails because the ideas are not explored, they're just thrown out there, with the vaguest hint as to how this came to be. The inhabitants seem so thoroughly brainwashed that they are just lines on a page: they lack plausibility or any third dimension of thought and genuine feeling. The 'way out' is, again, simplistic; it seems a sleight of hand, an easy way out of the plot. If you want to read a far better description of an alternative reality, try The Left Hand of Darkness, or The House of the Scorpion (though the latter suffers from the same structural flaw of  a rushed, easy ending).
B0084IG8TM|5|Quite a movie.  Kept me riveted for the whole film.  I really enjoyed the film, and Miss Jennifer Lawrence is very lovely and 'down to earth' believable.
B0015AARJI|5|This was the same type of controller that originally came with my PS3, easy to use and has a nice weight to it.
B008V8FVTI|5|Its a terrible story that was told, but it needed telling. The acting is superb and should have been full of academy awards.
B005GFPZYK|5|I enjoyed this book. Those that call him a coward or accuse him of lies and<br />misrepresentation are just plain wrong. Chris was a dedicated Seal proud to do his job well by protecting his fellow soldiers...war is hell and those who judge should walk in the shoes of the brave military not scorn<br />them...
B008Y720JU|3|Great movie until the ending. Way too cheesy.
B002KKCVR8|2|Shocked at the quality of this Teva product. Have owned several Tevas before and they were great but this Tanza fell apart and cracked in multiple places in the sole. Haven't bought another Teva since.
B008BQ8YHQ|5|Amazingly addictive tv series! Gabriel Macht is sexy and powerful and Patrick J Adams is witty and talented. Must see!
B0002S94OS|4|\\"Ashes of the Wake\\" is a good CD, but not nearly as good as LoG's previous releases. As most people already know, the production on those 2 older CDs was not that great, but even with that problem they were both 5 star albums.  With a new record label and the addition of a new producer, the sound quality has improved greatly, which is definately a plus.  However, the songs themselves don't seem to have the same edge as before. The best songs are \\"Laid to Rest\\" and \\"Now You've Got Something To Die For\\", but most of the songs are good.
B00JOT3HQ2|5|Cool awesome yay
B00BXLU1EU|1|When I ft this app I expected it to give me a password but it didn't just a bunch of random numbers
B00AIQP9DE|5|great game, lovely graphics.  there were a few glitches, but not anything big enough to ruin play.  sometimes when you try to use the monkey (which is a super cool part of the game)  a code message came up on the banner that shouldn't have...
074325144X|5|Heard many wonderful comments on this book and it was recommended to give as a gift.  Receiver seems very pleased with the choice!
0316172324|1|The author treats us to a rehash of things already written several times (one original,the others ' followers'). <br />Why then the bestseller status? Well,who knows,maybe some have short memories,or don't read anything until it is on some list. <br />not worth the money and time.
1594202273|5|A superbly paced book that presents the terrifying facts of nuclear weapons alongside near misses and the politics of the Cold War. Compelling reading.
B00FAPF5U0|5|As with most players, I've found this game quite addictive.  It's something the whole family could play, if you get frustrated on a level, just hand it over to the kiddo or spouse! I find it relaxing or mind numbing most of the time, but if you get more than one chocolate sprinkle ball.... watch out for my excitement :)
B002NJWHHA|4|Very good movie but I was surprised by how different the book was from the movie and how many parts were cut out. Even though it was extended edition it was so short and lacked much details from the book. The overall quality was great and I<br /> think it was worth it to rent it.
B00BD99JMW|2|I loved Divergent. There was something about it that I loved so much. The action, the characters; good stuff. Insurgent still had some of that, but lacked. I still liked it. But Allegiant lacked all of it for me.<br /><br />There were so many forgettable characters. The double POV thing was a mess. Tris and Tobias sounded so alike, I could barely distinguish them. The whole genetics thing got old. And the ending. I give props for doing an ending like that because not a lot of authors have the guts, but it felt bland. I don't know. I think a lot of you could agree. It didn't make me sad, it didn't make me so angry that I wanted to hunt down the author, I was just a bit disappointed with how it was executed.<br /><br />Overall, I got bored and felt empty after reading it. I didn't get the feeling of satisfaction that Divergent and Insurgent provided me with. I didn't hate it, but I sure didn't love it.
B00475AUWW|5|Steven Pressfield makes a complex subject simple and easy to understand. The book created many 'ah-has' for me as I read (always a joy when that happens). After reading his book - I look at resistance through more patient eyes. Instead of letting it (resistance) call the shots, I simply recognize it for what it is and move on.<br /><br />Pressfield's writing is straight forward and no-nonsense which leaves the reader with no doubt or confusion...a skill that is most welcome in this world of complexities. A must read for everyone...strips the veil off of why we react the way we do, and gives us a strategy for changing that reaction.
B009AMANBA|5|This film excels in every way: acting, direction, dialogue, authenticity.  It can be watched repeatedly, with new details and insights surfacing each time.
B0091WAN3C|5|Probably my favorite movie of all time.
B00009TB5G|5|Peter Jackson and his team sure know how to put together a DVD!  As with the 'Fellowship' extended edition, this one is packed with additional footage and behind the scenes extras.  There was a day when &quot;additional footage&quot; meant some unfinished junk that clearly needed to be cut from a movie as it was unwatchable.  But not here.  Every added scene blends flawlessly into the movie and has meaning and enriches the story further. The 'behind-the-scenes' footage is very thorough and entertaining, as well. <BR>A great story, great extras, and well worth the investment.<BR>By the way, for one reviewer, Tolkien wrote LOTR in the Twentieth Century.
B001CEE1YE|5|excelente
B006YTTVHO|4|This book is a good starting point for anyone that has difficulties approaching new people, and establishing conversations. I did not give it 5 stars, as I felt the first couple of chapters dwell too much on the author's experience.  This approach might cause readers to lose interest in the book altogether. However, the second half of the book make it worthwhile. Even if you feel the recommended actions might feel like common sense, the author did a great job compiling them in an practical day to day approach.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you feel you want to add new people in your personal and/or professional circles
B004UPAN6W|1|what a garbage pile lmao
B00BUCXVPI|4|I may not like Tom Cruise but he does make some good action movies! It was a good movie to watch on a Saturday evening
B00R3IHOPQ|5|Free App of the DAY is Great.
B00B2DSK06|5|My 3 year old would not want to sleep in his bed.  On my nights off, he would get on the couch with his pillow and blanket and we would watch Wreck-It Ralph and he would fall asleep before the end half of the time, the other half he would turn over when the ending credits ended (they are long).<br /><br />I was born in 1974 so there are many video game references from my childhood (Q-Bert) to adulthood (the exclamation point from Metal Gear Solid).<br /><br />I would say we have watched it together over 40 times so I absolutely got my moneys worth. Being online, we could watch it on any of the 4 Rokus in the house without the fear of losing or breaking physical media.
B00J8CG6KE|4|This was a wild adventure of a movie, the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I thought it was a bit long. It could have been 30 minutes shorter.
B00F4PM6WG|5|This app is wonderful, there are so many different things to click on while the train is in motion. The toddler also has the option of slowing the train down or making it faster which is great in case they want to tap on the surroundings to hear or see different things. My son has enjoyed this app very much.
0307888908|5|I really wish I read this when I was in high school.  For now on, I will be giving this book to as a gift to any graduate - high school or college.  It teaches valuable lessons and skills that are not taught or given attention to in a classroom.  And its not all about quitting your job and starting your own business or becoming an entrepreneur....its more of adopting a lifestyle and mindset where you treat your job or career as a start up.
B00KA87GCW|5|I like how fast you level up and how you don't need to worry about energy for the first like 12 levels.

B000V86OKG|5|I am not one to give anything away, but if i had to give a review on the second season i would say it's Brilliant!!  Love Dexter!!
B008LXZFH6|2|worse than I expected.... I didn't find it so funny.
B00KNWYDU8|5|This game is like clash of clans just with dragons! You should really get this game.It is so fun I play it 24/7
B0094BB4TW|5|Staying connected to out of town friends and family. Seeing what other friends think or consider worthy of posting and enjoying posting of pictures!
B006MW3UZW|5|we started watching season 1 and were hooked!  the history, the story and the acting is terrific.  we look forward to catching up with all the seasons and appreciate watching it on amazon.
B00JNQMKT6|3|The book is okay, but with the movie out, I would like to compare.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|As are all of Mr. Grisham's reads....fabulous!
B00K7C17QW|3|This game is fun, but I finally uninstalled it because it freezes up every time I play it.  I agree with others that it takes too much energy to advance through the game.
6301543408|1|I found this movie to be so awful that I can't even remember anything about it, other than Uhura's ludicrous fan dance. I guess I just blocked it out of my mind. As a fairly dedicated Star Trek fan, I'm very glad the following movies were far superior. Shatner needs to stay away from directing!
B00005ATQF|5|enough has been said about the plot, so ill just attest to this movies amazing ability to catch the feeling of the war, the marines and the condition both were in. it is as much a statement on society, war and the life soldiers live as it is an awesome war movie. great movie, full rating.
B00HCMG6LG|5|This is a great app and it's free so you can't beat that. It was a fun puzzle game with challenging levels.
B00MIA0KGY|5|Another great one!
B00FPM4IRO|5|I got this as the FAOTD a long while back. Just finished it today and decoded I needed to 5 star the game. But the game and enjoy it and support the developer so maybe they make more games.
B000AU9UYM|5|The best super hero movie of all time.  Better than all of the superhero movies combined.  Watch this and conquer your fears.
B003274QH6|4|suspenseful entertainment
B00M01J7Q0|5|Purchased this because I am slightly obsessed with &#34;Take Me to Church&#34; but love the rest of the songs as well.  What a smooth, beautiful voice!
B00PRSOG1E|5|Great little app. I could see all my kids playing this. Even my 18-month-old
B000AYEL6U|5|This is the only movie I've ever seen that I could say I liked as much as the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice
B00GRVV29E|5|I can't believe how responsive the app is to touch. There are no delays or stutters. It just keeps going as long as I can. Love the music, and even the idle particles are amazing to watch. I was on the fence because of its size, but glad I downloaded it. It won't be a daily app, but it's pretty freaking cool.
B001NCQSDM|5|I love Cream, and though this is a hodge podge of sorts, the album is an absolute must for all Cream fans.... Badge alone is worth the price of admission.
0810993139|5|I picked this book up on a whim over a year ago, and I'm glad I did. The humor is dead on, the situations are realistic to a middle school setting, and the characters are very easy to like. This book is perfect for kids of all ages, and it's especially great for kids who usually do not like to read!
B008JFUREC|5|love the movie and watch it often.  love the little guys and the adults do great job also.  is great movie
B003XF1XOQ|3|I have been reading books like 'The Hunger Games' for a while. I read Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, and I almost read Twilight. I thought that the endings were the strongest part, especially in Harry Potter, which THG are most compared to. This book gets VERY boring and talks about things that never are explained but has one thing that makes it so you can't stop reading: Peeta. He gets in a weird situation with Snow (not saying what... don't wanna spoil) and it kind of is the whole storyline. It ends too quickly. Gale is COMPLETELY out of her life in the Epilogue, which I think is stupid. It is a good series, but the book has a terrible ending, a bad storyline, and just SUCKS. It does not live up to Catching Fire, what is one of the best books ever in my opinion,
B0035LJZ1Q|5|I rented this one again after many years and still love it! Johnny Depp is always so good. I even got online and looked up the headless horseman actor. He is an exceptional rider and his sword work is amazing. Nice bod too. Too bad he had no head, but ladies, we can't be too picky!
B00KBC3N1U|5|Excellent cd
B00J5LXTUI|4|This movie is a action movie with crime syndicate undertones.  The action in this movie is amazing. If you want to see an action movie, you will not be disappointed. The only reason this movie is not five stars is because of the plot. It is too complex for its own good and subtracts from the movie.<br /><br />Overall if you like action movies, you'll like this film. Though you'll probably find it hard to not flash forward through all the dialogue scenes.
B00APUQT7I|4|We enjoyed this movie with our 3 year old son! Only wish the rental was longer or the price to buy was less expensive. (:
B00JCW0BCY|4|A realistic and rational look at dying and aging, written with the experiences of a surgeon but the goodwill of a humanitarian. Great read.
B002E2M5IC|1|HIAKU SUMMARY:<br />Why, Coen Brothers,<br />Would you do this to your great<br />filmic legacy?<br /><br />Nothing is worse than an overrated film. Sure, a bad film is pretty bad. But a film that is rated much higher than it deserves certainly is worse in the sense that the film is hyped and has much potential but falters in its ability to deliver.<br /><br />Maybe the Coens just set the bar too high with No Country. That film is untouchable, near flawless. That film was so brilliant that hell, even Fargo and The Big Lebowski, both excellent films, paled in comparison. Sure, Burn After Reading was bad (and they did have, I believe, one clunker before that, which was the hilariously awful Barton Fink), but this goes too far.<br /><br />The only thing even remotely remarkable about the film is the ending, where the school is evacuated due to a tornado warning, and the film's final shot, of the young man watching the oncoming twister, a powerful moment. I'm not saying films have to have tornadoes in them to be good, I just expect a movie to be entertaining, even if it's poorly written. I can forgive a bad movie if its at least entertaining, but this isn't it.<br /><br />The writing is awful. The dialogue seems to be written by an immature 14 year old. Mind you this is the same Coen Brothers that gave us No Country For Old Men, Fargo, Blood Simple, and The Man Who Wasn't There. The editing is sloppy; most of the film consists of people staring for a really long time without dialogue. Granted if you removed all the \\"long stares\\" this film would be about 45-50 minutes long. The characters are all just stereotypes of not just Jewish characters but characters we've seen before (mind you I'm part-Jewish). The acting wasn't too bad, a little wooden at times but I think they did good for the lousy film they had to work on.<br /><br />As for getting a best picture nomination... when No Country won best picture in 2008, I was filled with joy, shouted \\"YES\\", and jumped up and down in happiness. This getting nominated for best picture??? Please, it's in the runnings with Transformers 2: Revenge of the Boring in terms of godawfulness (and I said the same thing about the equally awful \\"The Hurt Locker\\").<br /><br />I've said it once and I'll say it again, people are sheep. That is the only way people like this crap enough to inflate its rating to 7.2/10 on IMDb. I'm sure the \\"art house\\" crowd will tell me how I'm wrong and how I don't get it. But simply put, this film is overrated, pretentious garbage. I thought \\"Burn After Reading\\" was bad but no, this film is awful.ture???

B00I3BRLPK|4|This movie is directed by Ron Howard, and he has done an excellent job.  The two main characters are well developed, and you really get to know these two Formula One drivers.  You come to understand the differences in their upbringing, personalities, and how they are differently impacted by their competition and success on the Formula One circuit.  The race scenes are exciting and quite believable.  The racing culture, at this highest of competitive and moneyed levels is interestingly and probably quite accurately portrayed.  In my opinion it is a more interesting, exciting and believable movie  than Gravity.
B00ANGICRE|5|Helen Hunt is great as usual. Surprised and pleased she did this movie. She will pull me to any movie she is in.
B00L24IJCY|5|Full of terrific LEGO-specific humor, some of which you can really only truly appreciate after spending countless years building LEGOs.  Amazing movie in every aspect.
B00JH3S0AI|1|Hard to follow, weak plot, was that Scarlett????
B0064X7FVE|1|I don't like the new version. It is not very user friendly and the format is not very easy to understand. For those of us that have been using the website and the app for years, this upgrade doesn't make sense. I wish they would go back to the previous version
B0054JZC6E|4|Pretty fun game.  I'm pleasantly surprised.  I kept seeing this game, but I wasn't sure if the games would be good considering how many there are. Most of the games are a great way to pass time.
B003Y8YXGC|5|John lennon  cd is very well don and music is grate. Go mp3 and give it a try its real good i think.
B00EY8BRGU|4|The twist at the end was really good and I didn't see it coming. I thought that a child of the before mentioned dead magician would be the mystery person behind everything but it was not who I thought it would be.
0671015206|5|This book sold so many copies because it is just a phenomenal piece of work. When people think of wealthy individuals, they might visualize Donald Trump, who lives a luxurious lifestyle. Most millionaires are not like Trump. They are frugal, they do not drive expensive cars, and they do not live in expansive mansions. Think of Warren Buffett who still lives in the house that he bought for $32,000 in 1957. Those who try to show off wealth are most likely in debt trying to impress everyone else.<br /><br />Stanley is an expert on the topic of wealthy individuals. He wrote several books on the subject, but this book is phenomenal. It is well researched and easy to read. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />- Mariusz Skonieczny, author of [[ASIN:0615287484 Why Are We So Clueless about the Stock Market?

B00PSLQYWE|5|Great show
B00A6CCF0K|5|great sequel to the Shining, my cat jumped on my bed in the middle of the night while reading this book, and I was awake for the rest of the night!!
B000002LE6|5|Lovesexy is funky funky album! Every track on this cd is worth at least ten Word Online-shares! Prince's duet with Van The Man on Glam Slam is breathtaking! Especially when Vannieboy sings 'I will take you in my  oldsmobile'. The same oldsmobile by the way that was featured in the  Lovesexy liveshows and is now owned by Willem Dercksen! Other songs, I No  and Alphabet St. for instance, are instant classics, dealing with subjects  as heroin addiction and child prostitution. The refrain of Lovesexy - the  song: 'Love love love! Sexy Sexy Sexy Lexie!' is very spiritual! Well,  enough said: buy it, listen to it and copy it on a cd-r! Bye now, I've gots  to get funky!
B006OCM0G0|5|love this game.  hate the hours hase also long to cook food but always s some thing to look forward to.

B002MQYOFW|5|way better than the movie action packed good read . can't wait to read the others. definatly recommend this book.
B009ZQC7MY|4|Now that you're invested in each character, the emotions intensify with each one's story.  Ranging from pure joy, to deepest grief.
B005721W9O|5|One of my all time favorite movies! Yup it's silly and simple, But Hey! With gags like Historical Documents in regards to Gilligan's Island, and the &#34;Chompers&#34;. Ad to it the message that whatever we do is significant, how can you go wrong?
B00BAXFECK|2|The author spent to much time describing each character and the happenings in the story.  Over 700 pages and the story could have been told in 300 pages...Did not care for this book.
140006922X|5|I can't think of a book whose text I've highlighted more than Reza Aslan's fascinating new biography, \\"Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth.\\" There are so many incredible points I'd never thought about, so many new takes on this 2000+ year-old story.<br /><br />First off, this is not a debunking of Jesus Christ. It's neither blasphemy nor sacrilege. The author, in his foreword, proclaims his Christianity. Still, this book might still make some devout Christians uncomfortable, even angry. Read it anyway. There is much to be learned.<br /><br />\\"Zealot\\" is the product of over twenty years of research, and Reza Aslan's well-researched and documented theories are like nothing I've ever read.<br /><br />There are three basic areas of focus. First, he examines the Jewish world near the dawn of the First Century C.E. Jesus of Nazareth was not the only messiah walking around back then. There were dozens, all of them claiming to be the son of God, performing miracles, and preaching to big crowds. It's not like Jesus turned thirty, then began doing something nobody else had been doing.<br /><br />John the Baptist was different, preaching charity and humanity. He baptized people in the Jordan, regardless of whether they were rich or poor. There was no charge at all. More on that in a minute.<br /><br />When Jesus came to be baptized by John the Baptist, He stood in line like everyone else. When John baptized him, there wasn't a clap of thunder, a voice calling down from heaven, or a dove appearing out of nowhere. What happened was that Jesus became one of John the Baptist's disciples for a period.<br /><br />When Jesus began his ministry, He was considered just another preaching exorcist/magician wandering around Galilee. However, there was one big difference with Jesus: He didn't charge for his miracles. Not a cent. The other roving \\"Messiahs\\" charged a lot.<br /><br />The second part of Aslan's book deals with the cozy relationship between the Jewish High Priestsand the Roman governors. Jerusalem was the center of Judaism, and the Romans tolerated it--even welcomed it--as long as it kept the people in line. At Passover and other High Holy Days, Jews flocked to Jerusalem. The outer parts of the huge temple complex were filled with vendors selling sacrificial animals. The High Priest took a cut of everything the temple made, and he lived like a king.<br /><br />One thing the Jewish High Priest never failed to do was make an arrangement with the reigning Roman governor, who also got a taste of the profits. Thus, it became doubly valuable for the governor to allow Judaism's continued practice.<br /><br />Jesus and his band of disciples--all of them essentially illiterate peasants and day laborers--stuck to the smaller towns and villages for most of His travels. Gradually, word got out that Jesus of Nazareth could heal the sick, and He spoke of a new kingdom to come. His reputation grew until He had His Biblically documented triumphant ride into Jerusalem for Passover.<br /><br />And Jesus did go a little Old Testament on the temple. He overturned the loan-sharks' tables, freed the sacrificial animals, and yelled at those who dared defile the temple. The Jewish elders tried and convicted Jesus, and the penalty for his actions was death by stoning. The Romans had a rule about that--no Jewish executions. Because Jesus was preaching about a new world order (for lack of a better term), Jesus was tried and convicted by the Romans, who sentenced Him to be crucified for sedition. The big trial in front of Pontius Pilate?<br /><br />If Jesus and Pilate were even in the same room, it's likely Pilate just wrote Jesus's name down on an official scroll, and sent him on to Golgotha. The hand-washing thing? Offering a choice between Jesus and Barrabas? Pilate having a change of heart?<br /><br />Lovely fiction.<br /><br />The final part of Aslan's book--and a mindblower for me--was his discussion of early Christianity, specifically the completely different stories told by the Apostles and the newly minted Christian, Paul.<br /><br />Paul's version of Christ's ministry was very different from what the Apostles remember. Paul added all the magic and showmanship, the drama and melodrama, things many of which never happened.<br /><br />\\"Zealot\\" read almost like an adventure. Unlike some histories, I fought to find time to read it. It was that beautifully written and fascinating.<br /><br />What Reza Aslan has done is challenge that much of Christianity is based on a Christ who never existed. BUT, the Jesus who DID exist was a spectacular, wonderfully inspired man worth every bit of adulation He receives.<br /><br />Most Highly Recommended<br /><br />(nb: I received an advance review copy of this title from the publisher via NetGalley)
B00H58VGIA|5|The was a very good book. Had to really love the way some of the servants chose to stand up for themselves in such an oppressive environment. Characters were interesting and loveable.

B00CWY76CC|4|Great game to play when you are board😂<br />I loved this game.
0316069353|1|If you are really serious about the price of e-books being so high, then you should boycott all the books from this publisher.     Not only are the prices of e-books so high, you also get an inferior product, full of typos and terrible formatting.    If you really want your voice to be heard, do something about it.
B00ARN0XGG|4|Good Movie...But the ending was not quite right... was a little disappointed with all of the &#34;dead&#34; time throughout the movie...just like the previous 3
B004BSFC6Y|2|The socks don't have any elasticity in them... at all.  So when she kicks her feet they just fly off her feet.  Also, the rattle noise could be louder to get baby's attention a little better.  Wish I hadn't bought them.
B002ZG9846|2|When I started watching this movie I expected a movie that's not trying to say anything about superheroes and how they relate to society. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the movie seemed to be smarter than it's promise at the beginning, but when you really read into the film you'll find just how shallow it really is.   As the movie starts out it seems to be a realistic commentary on what it would be like for a high-schooler to become a superhero, asking questions like \\"Why hasn't anybody tried it yet?\\" a statement which is flawed, considering that people HAVE tried it. The main character also states \\"X-Men, Fantastic Four, they got it all wrong, it's not the superpower that makes a superhero.\\" another flaw, considering that X-men and Fantastic Four have NEVER said that the hero is defined by his power. The movie gets REALLY lame when Big Daddy and Hit-girl come in, two very unrealistic superheroes who kill every drug dealer/thug they come into contact with. It's hard to answer why so few are willing to take the mantle of a superhero for the main character when a ten year old girl is stabbing bad guys left and right. As for the main character(kick-bum), he's a teenage boy who is a terrible superhero whose biggest contribution to crime-fighting is taking out a bunch of thugs with a gatling gun on a jetpack. At least the movie has a good musical score.   In summary, It's not the superpower that makes the superhero, it's the gatling gun jetpack.

B000274THQ|5|I had just returned from a two week intensive German language adventure when I ordered this German language DVD. I loved the Berlin footage and the fabulous storyline. This is an interesting tale if how one young East Berliner takes it upon himself to spare his devoutly devoted DDR mother from the stress of realizing that the world as she knew it has changed since falling into and awakening from a coma as the Wall came down in November 1989. Well worth watching once...interesting enough to watch again for the German language review.

B004XGN8W4|5|As the title says it is worth its $300 price tag.   What it is:  Hard Plastic Case (locks and is able to be secured by key/combo locks)  2 mesh carrying bags (inside the case for controllers, power cables, etc.)  15 inch, lid mounted display (unknown if it is 720p or 1080p) box says 720, however it comes up and is able to run games at 1080p resolution or so it says on the screen)  soft 2 sided venting material pad (to put your console on). One side is for the old noisy XBox 360, the other: the XBox 360S and PS3 Slim.  Pros:   -Lightweight for its size (its about the max size you can have as carry on for a plane IT IS ALLOWED AS CARRY ON!)  -Built in HD screen  -Has everything you need to get playing (apart from the console, controllers, and games of course :P)  Cons:  -Can't really think of one
B00DA6YEKS|5|I've been following Brandon since I found him through the wheel of time. He really is good at establishing endearing characters and creating fully developed world's. Words of Radiance is great! When I read sequels I always hate the exposition, the 're_treading of previous books. Careful what you wish for, it had been quite some time since I'd read the first in this series...and I found myself wishing for a consolidated recap (much to my annoyance as I've always professed to hate those). Brandon gives you a recap, but he drags you through the entire book to get it. For this reason reading the first in the series is a must  before reading WoR. Liked this book a lot. I will continue to follow Brandon in anything he writes!
B004FWXKXS|5|Great movie
B00EMXBDMA|5|With over 7000 reviews (and over 5000 of those 5 star reviews) it seems a bit superfluous to add one more.  But, what the heck.<br /><br />This was a very enjoyable read.  Also an easy one.  Lots of tech talk, but not the dreary dry sort.  The running dialog is very believable.  I liked the character right away and felt happy to follow along as.<br /><br />Worth the time.
B002VECM6S|5|I first saw this movie in the theater.  I was so impressed with it that I purchased the DVD as soon as it came out! This movie is a \\"must see\\".  One of the best I've seen in a long time!
B006MW3V6U|4|The ineraction of characters is gripping.  A good story about a lifestyle that no longer exists. Historically correct in its portrail of WWI.
0788816454|1|This has got to be the worst adam sandler movie ever made. His accent, his mother, the whole thing, it just plain ... I'm a huge Sandler fan, but if you are looking for a laugh, watch the wedding singer or big daddy. Use this movie as a balance for a coffee table or something.
B00821OX98|5|Fascinating charactors - UGLY Aliens but curious about them too.  I have only started watching it and can't wait to catch up.
B00H2EQFBK|5|Stumbled across the show by accident and now I'm hooked.  Can't wait for the 2nd season to begin - it can't start soon enough!
B002N8A14M|5|Pros: The plastic case fits well and is very secure; the Nano is held securely in the armband; the armband is nicely adjustable; even in the case, the Nano fits my iHome speakers; the whole system is versatile (you have a protective case, a clip which can be used on your belt, shirt pocket, the armband, etc).    Cons: the clear case does prevent some non-Apple earbuds from plugging in (but grab a file and make some minor adjustments); separating the clip from the Nano in its case can be a challenge and rough on your fingernails.
0525952926|5|To fully comprehend the story in Winter of the World you have to read the first in the trilogy, Fall of Giants.  Many readers fail to see how wonderfully Ken Follett has interconnected these five families with the brutal history of the 20th Century. I only wish that all three books had been released closer together.  I don't like waiting until 2014 to read the<br />last of the series.
B00IFMHZ58|5|I had a great time going down memory lane.  The movie has brought back so many good memories of the TV series and I'm currently binge watching season 1!

I'm a little over half way through it and own over ten cars all are upgraded in some way, I own some of the fastest cars in game and I keep a steady diet of around 80'000 credits.. And I've did all this with out spending a dime.. multiplayer is awesome to I love the challenge of trying to beat the highest ranked players in the world series with the fastest cars.. great game..
B00DJFIMW6|2|The game. Is great but when it auto updated to the new version it downloads fine the plays video the sets forever saying it is loading and stays that way for hours without letting you play that sucks
0547366205|3|Very adorable illustrations.  I just cannot get past the concept that \\"everyone\\" has 10 fingers and toes; this is just not the case, as youth will eventually observe.  The item will either be returned or donated.
1401223176|3|Jeph Loeb's Hush is intense. If you are going to go into the book knowing one thing, make it that. This book is painfully difficult to put down, every scene flowing into every other with all the momentum of a train speeding off a cliff.<br /><br />Of course, Hush is more than a collection of fun action scenes, though the main plot's development due to it occurring almost entirely in the shadows of explosions and grand gestures. A large part of this is the narration of Batman's thoughts which frequently color the scene and give information that would be otherwise impossible to convey.<br /><br />Generally, these work quite well, but they bring up two problems. The first is the presence of Batman's thoughts in scenes where Batman is obviously not present. Here, they act as more of an omniscient scene setter, but they are presented in the same style as the monologues, so telling the two apart is impossible. More important is Loeb's tendency to litter fight scenes with thoughts, which works for the most part but can occasionally lead to the odd moment where the action is frantic and Batman's thoughts are contemplative and, by comparison, almost bored, making it hard to really care about the action.<br /><br />For reasons not completely clear to me, Jeph Loeb decided that Hush needed to include every single character to ever see a bat shaped light go off in the sky. As someone relatively unfamiliar with the Batman mythos, I saw a huge number of new faces, but familiarity isn't required as Loeb does a great job of bringing you up to speed in a few quick lines. The characters themselves generally come off quite well, even though most are only given a limited space to develop, and though none of the sub plots are particularly important on their own, they each do a good job of keeping you interested while the main story slowly builds behind them.<br /><br />Of course, there's the inevitable straining of suspension of disbelief that occurs whenever you've got more than one guy in tights on the page at once. For the most part, this is handled well enough with the standard Batman characters. It is at times hard to see how the seventeen sidekicks that Batman's had over the years don't bump into each other all the time, but Loeb focuses on the character's on screen well enough, and gives them enough depth, that I can forgive that. What's harder to forgive are the characters that come from elsewhere, namely the Superman mythos. I'll just say it right here: I don't like super hero crossovers. It just seems silly. Still, when Batman was in Metropolis, I was able to tread the whole thing as a mildly enjoyable cartoon, but even that slight connection was blown apart when a super dog came on stage, and I laughed the rest of the way to the issue's end. Thankfully, superdog didn't make another appearance.<br /><br />By far the most important of the side characters, and the only one to really stay with the story for more than five minutes, was Catwoman, who begins a romance with batman towards the beginning of the story. Their relationship is more commented upon than acted upon, which can be fairly annoying, though fitting with Batman's character, but their interactions do lead to several good scenes and do serve to lend both characters more of a human side than they might have otherwise have had, as well as providing the lion's share of the text's rare breather moments.<br /><br />In the final issues, the main plot that's been, we're told, slowly building the whole time starts to emerge. I specify \\"we're told,\\" because, despite a few out of place events, most of Batman's theories come across as pointing fingers at random and seeing Cthulhu in the shadows behind his dresser. Still, the last issues do a good job of trashing our expectations, and the several layers of reveals at the end had me quite interested in who the villain would turn out to be.<br /><br />As for that villain's actual identity (I won't spoil the particulars for you), I'm unsure if it's a brilliant turn or a cheap trick. If this is one of your first Batman comics, try as hard as you can to guess the villain. You'll never get it, because the villain's scheme relies on an ability wholly unknown to the newcomer, but obvious to the veteran. At the time, I was more than a tad annoyed, but, in retrospect, I'm not sure that's fair. How much of bringing us up to speed is really Loeb's responsibility? If the device is already established in the Batman mythos, I guess it's fair game, so I won't hold the trick against him.<br /><br />The best word for Jim Lee's artwork is iconic. Every frame and character that the man draws is larger than life, from the monolithic muscles under Batman's suit to the fight scenes, which are just choreographed enough to have the feel of a martial arts master but just frantic enough to feel dangerous and unpredictable. Lee's style is, in no real way, realistic, but none of his characters ever devolve into caricature, and he's fluid enough for his super models to feel natural and powerful, fitting into the world rather than sticking out like an overly buff sore thumb.<br /><br />Besides, the athleticism of the characters makes a degree of sense. Providing you weren't immediately shot in the face, jumping from building to building to knock out criminals night in and night out would shape you up pretty well, I think. (Of course, that only explains one aspect of Lee's universal male anatomy, and damn little of his female equivalent, but we'll just let that slide).<br /><br />When it comes to scenery and fight scenes, Lee is equally competent, blending subtle hints that bring the scene to life amidst the more boisterous elements of the artwork in much the same way that Loeb does with the plot.<br /><br />At several points in the storyline events break into several strands, some operating in different chronologies, with the majority of the work of differentiating between them falling to the artwork. For the most part, different color choices keep the scenes distinct and provide each with its own feel, though the washed out palette of the recollections can make telling the details of the scene difficult. That could, of course, be argued as intentional - after all, it's not like we really remember every part of that day twenty-five years ago equally - but whatever the intent, things have certainly gone too far when I mistook the two boys for each other on several occasions.<br /><br />Hush can be a bit hard to take seriously at times, and not all of Loeb's ideas work out with quite as much finesse as one might hope, but the ride is fun from beginning to end. If you're willing to suspend your disbelief for a few hours, you won't want to stop reading until the ending, and you'll enjoy (almost) every minute of it. I wouldn't recommend this to someone looking for their first taste of Batman, but if you've got a few Graphic Novels under your belt, Hush is an entertaining read.of your first Batman comics, try as hard as you can to guess the villain.

0767802470|4|Bought the DVD after enjoying the video of Das Boot.  My only disappointment was I never figured out a way to get the English language to come on. (It looks to me the DVD doesn't have that option) So I end up listening to it in German with the sub-titles running at the bottom of te screen.  Having to constantly read the sub-titles makes it a little less enjoyable to watch but this is definitely the classic WW II submarine movie of all time.
6303269826|4|&quot;Silverado&quot; is one of the best westerns ever made, and &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; is another worthy western by Lawrence Kasdan. The film is a big sprawling attempt to capture the whole of the iconic lawman's  life, from his boyhood just after the Civil war through the Tombstone  years, and onward toward the Alaska gold-fields. &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; is  unusually ambitious in this regard for a Hollywood film, and attention to  historical detail was wonderful. I loved Costner as Wyatt Earp: as an actor  he is very much in the Gary Cooper mold; not overly expressive, and this is  just the right note for a legendary lawman, &amp; steely gunslinger. Dennis  Quaid is a phenomenon as Doc Holiday: skinny and haggard, he looks  tubercular (unlike the well fed Val Kilmer in the laughable  &quot;Tombstone.&quot;) The photography is sumptuous, &amp; the film score  dramatic and memorable. I can even laud the make-up artists who made the 40  something Costner look believably youthful for his  scenes as Wyatt Earp in  his 20's. Yes the movie is long, and a tighter hand could have prevailed  during editing, but compared to the typical Hollywood schlock one sees,  &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; is well worth the hours you invest in viewing it.  One of my favorite films of the last ten years. A great film in the western  genre!
B00LXFHI60|5|So good. Simple graphics that are emphasized by some nice lighting effects. Gameplay is smooth and intuitive. Narration is excellent.
B0089EHWQE|4|Wow, Heartbreakingly beautifully. It will stay with you long after you finish the last page.One of my favorites so far.
B00011F5DK|5|This game was very easy to learn and the rules were very simple.  But, the strategy of the game can be very thought provoking.  We bought this game for a family member for Christmas, but we loved it so much that we bought another one for us.  It's a great game for anyone 6 years on up!
B005M48WNQ|5|Excellent book on the horrors of factory farming, the environmental damage, on our eating choices, their morality, and how to approach these issues.  Goes well with Pollan's The Omnivore's Dilemma.  I hope that this book reaches as many hands as possible.
B008ENNXQI|4|This movie was funny and entertaining!  As an adult I appreciated the lesson of this old fairy tale.  Lily Collins was excellent in this movie.
068987474X|1|So I found this book in the lounge where I work and flipped through during lunch. If you get past the myriad of typos, the flawed/non-existent logic, and the fact it's not funny, there's pretty much nothing left but a nice looking cover.     Still, even though I don't think of myself as an idiot, I took the book to heart. So days later when I ended up in the ER and had a very gorgeous doctor who seemed wildly attentive considering I only had a sprained ankle (he asked me for my number) and he didn't call, I assumed, \\"Hey, he's just not into me.\\" and went about my life.    Flash forward six months later, I get a call from a number I don't recognize. I let it go to voice mail purgatory only to discover it's my \\"He's just not into you\\" Doctor saying, \\"I've been waiting the required six months before I could call you. I practiced calling you every day.\\"    Hmmm, you think he's just not into me? or maybe this worked out because I played by the \\"rules\\". who knows? It's all hooey.
B009ZQ8FQG|5|I watched the entire season in one day!  Can't wait for the new season!  Can't imagine what happens next.  Thanks for such a great show.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Who would think the moving of candy could be so enjoyable? Not only is it fun and addicting like any great app but it also is more invigorating to sign onto Facebook where you can see your friends scores, their progress,  and try to beat the top score. It's free so there is no excuse for not checking this app out for a try. You will not be able to put it down.
B00KK0PICK|5|Ok, the first time through, I thought that the author was . . . well, a bit obsessive.  I did take some of her advice, however, and even a veteran organizer/hater of clutter such as I found it very useful.  I re-read the book a couple of times through my annual clean out this winter and found that the ideas really worked.  (I did not, however, follow the spiritual suggestions.)
B00JOT3HQ2|5|Very addicting!! I just wish they had checkpoints like Mario bros but just 3 checkpoints for each level. That's the only frustrating thing about it!
B004KKXMSI|2|One of the disks (the movie Jurassic Park) was defective. It froze in the T-Rex scenes. The other two disks were fine. I enjoyed the better definition of Blu-ray.<br />Now I have to buy Jurassic Park again because sending the product back to Amazon is almost as expensive as buying a new movie.
B0095VP8D4|5|Bought to pair with an ASRock mobo for HTPC. A bit of overkill, I know, but I haven't had a single stutter with HD playback, either network or Netflix/Youtube/Escapist. Works great with XBMC. Would definitely buy again if I needed another HTPC, or even a simple gaming machine. Would probably kick butt as a MAME box too.
B004XJRQUQ|5|This trilogy is such an amazing escape which marries well with the title character and her quest. Collins does a fantastic job making you keep turning the pages all the way to the end - you might say the pages are on fire.
B00L9B7IKE|4|The book begins a little slowly, but steadily builds. The story is told through the eyes of of the women in the story.  All the characters are complex and well developed.  I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to others.
B007HJHO2O|5|This band just continues to impress.  Can't wait for more!
B000002J1S|4|Peter Gabriel's last project with Genesis is the epitome of what 70s bombast rock was all about, when rock musicians wanted to be opera composers and suchlike. TLLDOB is probably the best of all of those, but  you have to be in the mood for something like this before you put the CD  in. It's not easy listening. It *is*, kind of, opera. Brilliantly well  done, but, in essence, opera.
B0029VT3UQ|4|The movie brought to life many essential emotions that are not read in the book. The book was more brief than expected, and the movie portrayed another depth.
B00028HBKC|5|This movie is great; very well organized, script is wonderfully written, the soundtrack is awesome, the performances are terrific, and the way that the story is presented is incredible.  It will captivate your attention from beginning to end.  It is Biblically and historically accurate.  The movie is very violent, but there are popular video games that are more violent and the content of James Bond movies are worse than the Passion of the Christ. <br /> <br />The movie has some parts that are not mentioned in the Bible, or history, but do bring the movie to life and/or help develop the Gospel in the movie.  For instance, in the movie, Satan follows Jesus the whole way trying to tempt Jesus not to die on the cross so that Jesus would not provide salvation from sin, and when Jesus dies, Satan is screaming from Hell because he realizes that he has lost the war. <br /> <br />While I may not agree with all the little details, I whole-heartedly agree with the Big Picture presented in the movie.  Jesus Christ is not just presented as a good man and good moral teacher; but also as the Son of God, Savior and Redeemer of the world, the promised Messiah, Sovereign Ruler of the University, and descendant of Israel's King David and the future King of the Jews who will restore the throne of David forever. <br /> <br />When I first saw that Hollywood was making a movie about the last 12 hours of the life of Jesus Christ, I thought, `Oh no, here comes another secular version of Jesus.'  But when I saw the movie in theaters, I was blown away. <br /> <br />Christians can definitely use the Passion of the Christ as a witnessing tool.  The movie does not present the whole Gospel.  There are lots of little abstract lines, such as: when Jesus is carrying the cross, he says to his mother, \\"I am making all things new.\\"  The movie does not thoroughly explain the whole story, but it presents a good part of it.  Therefore, Christians must be ready to explain the rest.  <br /> <br />`The Passion of the Christ' has been called anti-Jewish; but it is no more anti-Jewish than `Schindler's List' is anti-German.  Is Tolstoy's `War and Peace' anti-French?  Is James Fennimore Cooper's `Last of the Mohicans' anti-American Indian?  Is `Red Dawn' anti-Russian?  Is Orwell's `1984' racist toward anyone?  I believe the answer is `no'.  For all of the Jews and Gentiles who condemned Jesus, a significant number believed that Jesus Christ was innocent and followed him.  Besides, despite all that happened, Jesus willingly went through everything. <br /> <br />Anyone who truly understands the Christian Bible will understand that the Jews, who are also the children of Israel, are God's chosen people forever, (Gen. 15:18, Gen. 17, Ex. 6:4-5, Lev. 26:42-45, Deut. 4:31, Deut. 4:37, Deut. 5:2-3, Deut. 7:9, Deut. 8:18, Deut. 10:15, Jud. 2:1, 2Sa. 7:24, 2Kings 13:23, 1Ch. 16:15-17, 1Ch 17:22, Ps. 105:8-10, Isa. 54:10, Jer. 30:9, Jer. 31:33, Eze. 20:5, Eze. 37:19-28, Da. 11:32, Hos. 1:17, Hos. 3:5, Zeph. 2:7, Zech. 10:6, Zech. 12:5).  God spoke of the children of Israel when he said \\"They will be my people and I will be their God,\\" (Gen. 17:8, Ex. 29:45-46, Lev. 26:12, 2Sa 7:24, 1Ch. 17:22, 2Ch 6:1-11, Ps. 50:7, Jer. 7:23, Jer. 11:4, Jer. 24:7, Jer. 30:9, Jer. 30:22, Jer. 31:1, Jer. 31:33, Jer.32:38, Jer. 50:4, Eze. 11:20, Eze. 14:9-11, Eze. 34:24, Eze. 34:30, Eze. 36:28, Eze. 37:12-13, Eze. 37:23, Eze. 37:27, Eze. 39:7, Hos. 1:10, Hos. 2:23, Joel 2:26-27, Zeph. 2:9, Zech. 8:8, Zech. 10:6, Zech. 13:9).  Moses also spoke of the promised Messiah when he said to Israel, \\"God will raise up another prophet like me from among you,\\" (Deut. 18:15).  God spoke through the prophet Isaiah about the Messiah when he said \\"It is too small a task for my Holy One to redeem Israel, I shall make him a light to the Gentiles,\\" (Isa. 49:6-7).  Jesus Christ said of the Law of Moses and the prophets, \\"I have not come to abolish the Law, but to fulfill it,\\" (Matt. 5:17). <br /> <br />Many of us are familiar with Mel Gibson's recent law violation, when he was pulled over for drunk driving and then slandered the Jewish people.  I do not hold it against him since he was quick to confess and admit he was wrong; he asked for forgiveness; he agreed to restitution and he is working to not make the same mistake again.  I hope other people will forgive him too. <br /> <br />This is a great movie for everyone regardless of age, race, or creed.  Since it is violent, Parents should watch this movie before allowing children under 14 to watch it.  Eastern Orthodox Christians, Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Atheists, Agnostics, Homosexuals, Humanists, Animists and even Satan worshippers should watch the Passion of the Christ. <br /> <br />\\"The Passion of the Christ\\" will stand alongside with other epics like \\"The Ten Commandments\\"
1449325947|5|This book is both board and deep. Meaning it covers a ton of topics and goes in-depth on all of them. This book is great for the beginner, but also has a lot of advanced material.<br /><br />After a nice introduction that explains the structure of the book the author starts off Part 1 covering the basics. The book starts with the basics and leads us to advanced topics by the end of the book.<br /><br />I have listed the 5 parts of the book below with the chapters they contain to give an idea of all the topics covered.<br /><br />Part 1. CSS Basics<br />1. HTML for CSS<br />2. Creating Styles and Style Sheets<br />3. Selectors: Identifying What to Style<br />4. Saving Time with Style Inheritance<br />5. Managing Multiple Styles: The Cascade<br /><br />Part 2. Applied CSS<br />6. Formatting Text<br />7. Margins, Padding, and Borders<br />8. Adding Graphics to Web Pages<br />9.

CSS Resources<br /><br />I have found CSS to be very powerful, but a lack of understanding can lead to some messy web sites. I have seen some really tragic HTML/CSS/JavaScript implementations. Reading this book and using it as a reference will help avoid that. The author does a great job of showing how things should be done the right way.<br /><br />The author did a great job putting together the code samples. Each chapter has two folders. One with the beginning of the solution, and one marked finished for the end result of applying the techniques shown in the chapter.<br /><br />The author does a great job covering responsive web design. This is something I have seen mangled up a lot. The author covers media queries, flexible grids, and fluid images. He also did a great job in this part of the book leading into responsive web design with chapters on CSS layout and float-based layouts.<br /><br />The nice flow is actually found throughout the entire book. The chapters are put together in a very logical order which is one of the characteristics that make this book a good cover to cover read.<br /><br />I also really liked the chapter on providing a print page using CSS. The is nothing more annoying than finding a great article, blog, or a product description that you want to print out that just won't print nicely. I can't tell you how many times I have recreated information on the web in word just to be able to print it. This chapter does a great job of showing you how to avoid aggravating your customers with unprintable pages.<br /><br />The author's writing style make this an easy cover to cover read, but it is also laid out in such a way that it also makes a great reference.<br /><br />Overall I found this book to be a great read and highly recommend it to all web developers and also to those Windows 8 Store App developers using HTML/CSS/JavaScript.b design.

B00JOT3HQ2|4|The game is hard fun and well I think it's like the impossible game.
B00332CWLW|5|An amazing story of so many lives entertwined on such a historical day.I have recommended this for many book clubs.Fantastic.
1577311523|5|I enjoy self help books, but this has been the best so far.<br /><br />I would highly recommend it!  It can change the way you think.
B0083GPDBO|1|This was terrible.  I should have pulled it out after 10 minutes.  The characters are morons.  I hate this movie!
B00PSLQYWE|5|Fantastic too bad only one season left
B00DJFIMW6|4|good game but everytime you play you need to be online which is annoying when my child is trying to play it somewhere where we have no online access. but other than that its fun.
B006QQCCOY|1|No review
B000N6TX1I|5|This is a beautifully crafted, powerful and resonant film. Viewers looking for a conventional action or science fiction film will be disappointed, because \\"Children of Men\\" has much more of the spirit of an art film. In fact, each scene of the film, instead of being filled with CGI, is composed like a provocative painting. (In this manner it recalls another dystopian masterpiece \\"A Clockwork Orange\\".) The story itself revolves around the theme of hope. In a future where no children are being born, human life has been reduced to a mixture of despair, violence and empty pleasure-seeking. When a pregnant woman is discovered for the first time in 18 years, she becomes both a beacon of hope and a pawn in the political agendas of various societal elements.<br /><br />My friends who watched this film with me didn't like the film's open, anti-climactic ending. I thought it suited the film perfectly. Bravo.
B007IXWKUK|5|OmG what a great book!! Getting ready to read BOOK 3...I so looking forward to it!! Loving this series of books!
B002W7H3EA|5|One of the greatest films of all time. Watch it now.
B00DR0PDNE|5|This product has met my expectations.

0140186395|5|I happened to read this book at a time when the events and relationships in the book were relatable. Having had time to really digest it, I have found that this is a book that really sticks with you. I still wonder what the characters are doing, what drove them, etc. Upon finishing this book, I found the symbolism, parallels, moralism and the artistry of words make this the greatest book I have ever read.
1402786360|5|I love it. It is a beautiful book full of recipes and creative ideas. I am a big fan of Heathers blog and now of her book. I highly recommend it.
B00GZ7M17C|4|Not a fan of re-makes at all, but I give this movie an exception. It actually was very well done and as close to the script as the original Carrie with Sissy Spacek . Julianne Moore gave a scary performance and the lighting made her face, which is usually beautiful, quite haggard looking. It was well cast, the scare factor was there all the way through the movie, and I really did enjoy it.
B000AARKOO|3|To me this felt like an attempt to recreate the sucess of Gladiator.   There were many similarities - the scenes of old Jerusalem were very much like those of Rome (albeit equally spectacular!), the battle scenes were filmed in the same style as those in Gladiator, and the lead character's story was similar.   What was missing was the character development.   Orlando Bloom did a reasonably good job with the lead - he doesn't have quite the gravitas he needs to make the big speeches before a battle, but other than that he did a fine job (and I gotta admit, he looks even better than Russell in those period clothes!).    Liam Neeson and Jeremy Irons were both excellent, as usual.   But I never got as emotionally involved with the characters as with Maximus - the story jumps from spectacular scene to spectacular scene without enough tying it all together.   We're clearly supposed to feel some sympathy and respect for Salidin, but that's never justified.   In the end, it leaves you feeling a  bit empty.  Perhaps the 40 minutes that will supposedly be in the \\"director's cut\\" will fill in those blanks.    Ridley, you've got the scenery, costumes and special effects down - next time spend a little more money and effort on the script.
B00632HWOG|4|I joined this app after the original email thing, that came with my kindle, stopped working.  I had changed my password for my ymail on my lap top and it threw my kindle and my cell phone off.  I then changed it back to the old password but my kindle and phone couldn't lock on to the server.  Thank god this app is here!!  Now I am able to get my email without any problems.

B006ID6NDQ|5|This is a wonderful story. I've read alot about the Holocaust, some are wonderful stories like this one, some are too sad. But these stories changed my life. Most Gentiles say that also, it is life changing.
0345535529|5|awesome
B004ZY0VHY|5|This was one of the most frightening books I have ever read; scarier than the scariest Stephen King novel ( and I have read practically everything he has ever written). I could not put it down.  It was ironic that I picked it up soon after the Chardon high school shootings, but the book is not so much about a school shooting as it is about the mother's life after the event.  It is told entirely from her perspective, in a series of letters to her husband, whose whereabouts are only hinted at until the end. Very suspenseful, disturbing,yet compelling.
B00AESN8XY|5|Cool
B00457WZEI|5|What a well written story. Very delightful heartwarming book. Would recommend  this read for anyone young or old.  I couldn`t put it down until done.
B00124PXW8|4|The classic horror movie. Any fan of the genre loves this film. No need for modern effect and make up to make this better.
B0081BU42O|5|I'd read Banks' Consider Phlebas, and, although well-written, didn't enjoy it too much.  I loved this book though.  I'll now try the other Culture novels.

B000002H97|5|As being a hardcore Metallica fan, owning all their albums this is one of the best, if not THE best one of all. Here's a rundown of all the songs:<BR>1.Enter Sandman 10/10-one of the best guitar riffs ever.<BR>2.Sad But True 10/10-very heavy riffs/drums.<BR>3.Holier Than Thou 7/10-not one of my favorites, but not bad nonetheless.<BR>4.The Unforgiven 15/10-Holy Jesus this is a awsome song, very powerful lyrics, my favorite 'Tallica song.<BR>5.Wherever I May Roam 10/10-another awsome song,first song that I memorized.<BR>6.Don't Tread On Me 10/10-heavy lyrics and guitar,sweet song.<BR>7.Through the Never 7/10-not a fav, but not terrible either.<BR>8.Nothing Else matters 8/10-not very heavy,but good lyrics.<BR>9.Of Wolf and Man 8/10-somewhat heavy, a good song still.<BR>10.The God That Failed 10/10 a heavy-riffs/heavy lyrics, phenominal song.<BR>11.My Friend of Misery 7/10, my least fav song but not bad by no means.<BR>12.The Stuggle Within 9/10 fast-paced heavy song, very good.<br />So that's a layout of all the songs of the album, as you see none are bad. All I can say is BUY THIS BAD@$$ ALBUM NOW!!!
B00005B1W5|5|Product is as described. Fast shipping. Excellent packaging. This is by far my favorite Yanni release.
B006YVTW1C|4|I liked this book, both the storyline and the content.<br />There was some good information in it, and it was easy to read.<br /><br />The book had one sentence in it about reincarnation being when two<br />different bodies had the same cellular attributes that I thought was silly.<br />Other than that, it was a very good book.
B002436WFI|4|This was a gift for my boyfriend for Christmas. He loves this movie but could never find it on DVD. I was really glad I was able to surprise him.
B000OVLBFS|5|Tom Selleck is absolutely perfect as Jesse Stone, a character created by the great crime author Robert Parker. Selleck plays a burned out, alcoholic cop who takes a job in the small town of Paradise, Massachusetts as sheriff. \\"Night Passage\\" is the tale of the quest by the emotionally damaged Stone for the killer of a young girl. William Devane costars as Jesse's shrink and he is excellent. Terrific secondary characters. In my opinion, Parker's Jesse Stone series of novels eclipses his famous Spenser books. This story line is the prequal to CBS's fabulously successful \\"Stone Cold\\", Selleck's first outing as Jesse Stone. Grab \\"Night Passage\\" . . . the Jesse Stone made-for-TV movies are quality productions with superb acting and beautiful cinematography. Stunning music. Exceptional TV. Highly, highly recommended. You don't ofter see TV this well done these days. You must also pick up [[ASIN:B0009FU0ZQ Stone Cold]] one of the best ever made for TV movies and [[ASIN:B000OVLBG2 Jesse Stone - Death In Paradise]]. Can't wait for the latest Jesse Stone TV movie, Sea Change, to be released on DVD!!

B0056BMK6K|5|John Locke gives specific ways he sold 1 million copies in 5 months. A no-nonsense, step by step set of instructions on how other authors can avoid mistakes in reaching their customers.
B0060MYM7O|5|Great series and must have the digital copy, so with Vudu you can watch in near Bluray quality on many devices.
B0067Q42BY|5|Great visuals, soothing music, and a fun twist to make it more adventure-oriented. There is an ad at the beginning but it takes about two seconds to click Play. I read a review on here that complained about the tutorial...are you kidding me? It's an integral part to ANY game...Great game, well worth a try.
B00EL8I8IS|5|Tightly good

B00881VLCE|2|This is ok but it kind of gets boring after a few plays.
1400052181|5|Hands down not only one of the best non-fiction books I've read, but best books I've read. Incredibly addictive, heartwarming, shocking and educational. I absolutely loved this book!
B00005JKN9|3|`Gangs of New York' is definitely not a great movie, but it's not as bad as some have labeled it either.  It's certainly long enough, although with a film of this epic grandeur it probably could have used some more battle time.  The weakness in this film falls in the hands of lead actor Leonardo DiCaprio who fails miserably to command his role.  He lets Daniel Day-Lewis run away with the entire show, and run he does.  As Bill `The Butcher' Cutting, Day-Lewis is at his most charismatic and impressive, chewing up every ounce of scenery at his disposal, and at an almost three-hour running rate he has quite a bit of time at hand. <br /> <br />The film takes place in 1863 and revolves around Amsterdam Vallon (DiCaprio) as he strives to avenge his father's death at the hands of Bill Cutting.  Leo never quite develops his character fully and leaves the viewer a bit tired of seeing him.  The plot drags out a bit too much and I found myself growing bored unless I was watching Day-Lewis chew, chew and chew some more.  Cameron Diaz does well but the film has little use for her and it shows except for one scene involving a knife throwing scene with Daniel where their chemistry is bright and she makes good for herself. <br /> <br />This isn't, as I mentioned, a great movie but it's a decent one that has its share of good moments, most of which include the aforementioned Daniel Day-Lewis.  This film also sports a rich cast of supporting players like John C. Reilly (just love him) and Jim Broadbent and of course is rich and beautifully shot by none other than acclaimed director Martin Scorsese who proves once again why he's so well loved.  It's not a movie you'll hate, but you may end up scratching your head as to how it received 10 Oscar nominations, most shocking being that Best Picture nod that could have gone elsewhere.
B000UR9T8C|4|It was a cool idea to have Peter Parker's suit turn black from some foreign substance that alters the mind and makes one do weird, crazy, and unfriendly things. It just added to the plot and twisted it even more. Above all, it made Peter seem 'human', instead of the do no wrong image that he had in the first two movies. In this movie, there are several things going on at the same time: the avenging of Harry's father's death, the avenging of Peter's uncle's death through Spider-Man, a relationship between Peter and Mary Jane going sour, a competition between Peter and another Daily Bugle photographer, and an aunt who's teaching Peter that revenge is not the answer to any problem. In the end, the killer of Peter's uncle is remorseful, and Peter accepts him. Also, Harry is told that his father's death wasn't at the hands of Spider-Man, and ironically he dies the same way his father did, but not before forgiving Peter and assisting him to bring down the villains. As usual, the effects are superb, the action plentiful (easily the most action out of the three movies), and the emotion is heartfelt. This was an ambitious effort by the moviemakers, and those who love the franchise will really appreciate this one. I rank this movie 2nd out of the three.
B00AQNOCZ0|5|Love the box set!
B00B0NDF26|5|The lyrics are so poignant and the phrasing is gorgeous.  The sound is pop on the surface but more than that below. &#34;I couldn't be your friend&#34; hits me especially hard and rings so true.
1439177791|5|Portia de Rossi wrote a great book. She is an amazing and extraordinary woman to survive anorexia and bulimia. This book is great for anyone who needs help understanding eating disorders and what a person has to go through before they finally get the help they need. There's a lot more to eating disorders than people think. Eating disorders can ruin ones life more than you really know. A job well done to Portia de Rossi for writing such a wonderful and helpful book...
B004J4WKUQ|5|A great trip down memory lane for any child of the 80's centered around a compelling story that you can't seem to put down.
B00395ZYVS|5|Knowing nothing about India, this book gave me a peek into the world there with an excellent, intriguing book. Highly recommend.<br />I
B0071NOU78|4|The Luke Skywalker Lightsaber from Return of the Jedi is one of the most unique from the original trilogy, and this thing is almost just as awesome.<br /><br />The first thing I will point out is that this is a TOY that originally retailed around $35-$40. The Luke Skywalker version wasn't produced for that long, but is a popular version to collect. The result is the $75+ price point that you're finding now. It seems Hasbro made a lot more of the Darth Vader version, which you can still find closer to the original $35 retail price. If you just want something for a kid to play with, that's probably your best bet. It's cheaper and unless they really appreciate the differences in the hilts and characters, they will probably be happy with anything to light up and wave around. I even saw one that is Vader's hilt but can switch from red to blue, all for much less than $75.<br /><br />Quality is decent for a toy, but it is still a toy. It's plastic throughout and you can feel why people are complaining that the power button sticks/breaks. It has a tendency to depress at an angle and become stuck, but so far a little gentle pressure has unstuck it and the function is fine. The metallic paint finish looks great and the colors make an accurate representation of the movie, though the shape is not screen accurate (see below).<br /><br />The sounds are awesomely accurate to the movie. It gives the distinctive snap-hiss sound on power up and power down, and also emits a satisfying hum when it's lit. The motion sounds are not very precise on mine, meaning that sometimes you wave it and it makes the right noise, and sometimes it doesn't. The clash sound and blade flash always work on impact though (muahaha)!!<br /><br />The lights are great; one of the best features of the Ultimate FX line is that the LEDs in the blade light up in sequence to produce a nice extension/retraction effect. It's really bright as well. It flashes on impact. No complaints there!<br /><br />One thing to point out for collectors is that this is not screen accurate (if you look at pictures of the actual hilt from the movie you will see that this one is a bit chunkier at the top). It's not a huge deal in terms of toys, but if you are collecting it may bother you. If you are collecting though, keep in mind that this is just a plastic version of the more expensive die-cast Force FX saber, which is also not screen accurate AND is twice the price.<br /><br />Finally, I actually bought this over the weekend at a toy store. I had seen the Luke RotJ saber when these first hit stores but then didn't see it again for a long time. I happened by a store this weekend and there it was, 30% off. I paid a third of what it's listed for here (and wish I didn't throw the box away)! That is where it lost a star in the review. I was floored that they were so expensive here. I would say that $75 is pretty steep if you just want a toy to wave around, but could still be worth it if you're a collector. You may just want to explore other avenues before paying that much. Just let the Force be your guide!
B0083Z6AH6|2|So slooooww!
6305736650|5|Great remastered movie.  One of the best movies made.
B00BAXFECK|5|Totally absorbing; big fat old-fashioned read chockfull of characters, details, and a fascinating plot. A novel not to be missed.
B00005TT77|1|received cd scratched so bad will not play, no jewel case, no liner notes. None of this was mentioned by the seller. Very dissatisfied.  Do not reccomend this seller. Will not purchase from this seller again.
B001C4CI8U|5|Thanks
B00GLX1MG6|5|Right up front, the language is a bit raunchy but appropriate to the situations and if you're easily offended by off-color humor than perhaps avoid this movie.  If, however, you are open minded then you will find this movie to be hysterical.  It reminds me a lot of the movie Something About Mary - lots of sexual humor and off-color jokes but ultimately one of the funnier movies of the last decade.  A true laugh out loud movie with some excellent acting by the ensemble cast.  The story line has been recapped a hundred times here already (why people insist on that I'll never know, perhaps frustrated movie critics) so I'll just say that if your in the mood for some escapist humor, rent/buy this movie, you will not be disappointed.
B00IFOOPM2|4|Glad to see the entire gang return. Kristen was correct in that the movie allowed for another without being cheesy. Dax was that guy. Excited to see if Rob will make another movie.
B00PSLQYWE|5|This show is like one of those books you can't put down...
B004SIP9B0|4|Helen Mirren does a great job, damn I wonder how she still looks so good now,  Her portrail of QEII  was exceptional as was the movie.
B000641ZA4|5|Seeing these brings back memories. It has been many years since I saw them on TV. These are better than what I had taped.
B009AZZEU2|5|They've been away for too long! Finally, a long overdue album that doesn't suck. Soundgarden is back in true form and that's a real good thing.
B0017HPHBM|5|Batman is the best super hero out there. This is a great movie along with all of the other ones that are out now.
B00846REIS|5|I picked this book up after seeing it rated highly on several lists of books like Fifty Shades of Grey, and boy was I pleased! This book was a great follow up to Fifty and definitely recommended to those looking for their next read!!
B009NG1Q96|5|Excellent! Very good book i like this author alot...cannot waiy to read her other books soon! Thank you much :)
B002413TY2|4|I love Jason Statham. He's a better version of Stallone and Willis. He is about as high energy as they get, kind of like Matt Damon in the Bourne movies.<br /><br />But, the Transporter series is getting a little old. They really are almost the same story just different faces. I know the concept of the  Transporter movies are similar, but I think after three it's time to move on.<br /><br />BTW, Safe is my favorite Statham movie to date.
B00GDFVTZQ|5|I like it graphics are good gameplay is good 100% recommended
B007ZGO7EM|5|works wonderfully and never fails perfect for kindle fire big display easy to read and very helpful in times of need
B00000JCOV|5|this has to be the most amazing album in the history  of metal!  i don't think anyone can top this, with the heavy guitar riffs of songs like (sic) or the unique hard hitting percussion and drums in eyeless, not to mention  the scratches in surfacing. these are just are few of the great songs  slipknot has produced. i think corey has the best voice i've ever heard in  my life.  this album is most defintely harder and more incisive than the  first korn album.  if you are looking for an album with alot of energy to  get you going, THIS IS IT!
B00QW8TYWO|5|So he could play this
B00DRPVE3M|5|What fun to play Uno, you don't have to wait until you are with your friends to play it, now! You will always have friends right at your fingertips, ready to play!
B00J3AW23G|4|I didn't have any issues with rating button like some said. It asked me once and I rated it and did not return. The game is fairly easy u can use hints all u want if it not up for a challenge. Good app to pass time by.
B00XOX9QCS|5|Great movie
B007ZGO7EM|4|This easy to use calculator is exactly what I was looking for.  It's design makes it look just like a real calculator - if it wasn't for the ad running across the top, it would be perfect.
B00I2TV3NO|5|Great series,  can't wait for mocking Jay
B00170DEM8|5|The best of all the holiday movies!
B00003CXXI|5|This movie is truly one of those rare jewels that comes along once every ten to twenty years.  It is destined to be a classic that appeals to both young and old.  I laughed and I cried.  My daughter and I enjoy this movie so much, we watch it at least twice everyday (We have owned the video since Thanksgiving 2001).  Moreover, this movie delivers a very strong message.  I am a movie buff, I have seen them all.  For me, this movie stands right up there with the classics.
B005SCSL56|5|When I read this book I noticed it was fantasy and I hate fantasy but I loved this book and for now on I will look the the Disney stories different and I can't wait to read the second book
B00LD1RZGM|5|Packed full of resources for game-changing individuals in any industry, the authors have  provided the tools to effect massive change in the world.  Can you put it all into action and improve our world???
B00DFFI7K2|3|After the first G.I. Joe movie, I had low expectations for this sequel (worth questioning why I selected it in the first place).  Overall it was a, silly and entertaining action movie.
B00DPM7TIG|5|This book, from beginning to end, is probably the most beautifully written book I've ever read. If you're considering this purchase, I promise you will not be disappointed. This story easily found a place in my all time favorites list.
B00992CF6W|5|When is 0.12.1 coming out
B001GMQE7E|5|The whole album. Honestly, I used to buy CD's just to get one song. I'd listen to that song over and over and usually never explore the rest of them. Una Mattina? I have the entire album on my iPod playlist. It's that good. The songs are varied but cohesive, ranging from playful to sensual to passionate. In the coming year, I hope to add more of Ludovico Einaudi's works to my collection. I'd give each song on this album 5 stars. For me, that's saying something!
B00FKAA3MA|5|This album was all that I hoped for. There were great features, beats and, of course, mind-bottling, bad ass lyrics! I love everything about it and I listen to it everyday!
B000002KOO|5|Classic Fleetwood Mac!
B005XQLBU4|5|good app
B00AG6Z92C|3|A sensual cd overall but a couple of selections I could have done without. Classic Andrea Bocelli work for the most part.
B00L9B7IKE|5|This book was a fun read. Written from multiple points of view. It kept me interested.
B000GT7XXW|5|This is a true and full version of the drama. I have seen many of these films, but this ranks as the stellar endeavor.
B00CFA222M|5|very good
B007EC6FIS|3|Ok Album not their greatest.
B004A8ZWT2|3|I didn't particularly like it but I guess it was okay.  However, the tape itself was very clear.  For some reason, the Blu-Ray did not play on my BluRay machine.
B00AREIAI8|5|this is a awesome game I love it my kids love it and we love the person who made it
B00KN15P56|5|This is it! I have been listening to Callas, and her recordings - all of them - since 1956. I attended the master classes and bought her records in every available iteration: 78s, Angel LPs, improved European LPs, pirated editions of the live performances, the original CD issues, the 1997 remasters and now, this astounding set of definitive discs. I know this fascinating voice - \\"too clear for the dramatic roles and too dark for the light ones\\" but always guided by a towering musicality unprecedented in Italian opera - from top to bottom and this is the way I always dreamed of hearing it. To have the life's work of one of the geniuses of the Twentieth Century beautifully presented in one monumental box is thrilling for me beyond all expectations. I have been listening to each complete opera and recital in reverse chronological order from end to beginning of her career and the revelations abound. Each evening, I disconnect the phone and plunge into a new adventure. It is like sitting at the feet of Scherazade for a thousand nights and a night. Everything is revealed, laid bare. You hear everything, and the unprecedented depth, power and richness of the orchestra, alone, is worth the price of admission. Those who understand and love Maria Callas will find this to be the fulfillment of all expectations. Those who haven't ever understood her, will get it now. And those are the operative words from me: Get It Now!
B00FN2KR2G|5|Enjoyed the read!  Thought the ending was particularly quirky, and I would enjoy a follow-up story on the neighborhood crowd.
B000ID37RM|4|A movie that I hadn't seen in years.  Very much a classic.  Streamed through the WII with excellent quality.  The price couldn't be beat.
B000089RVX|3|And i probably should have stuck wth the single. There are some other good ones on here (Going Under, Tourniquet, My Last Breath) but I wouldn't say that is enough to make me want to buy it. It does have a cool sound though, especially with the choir backing them up, but that's not enough. The worst song is My Immortal, a song for the Goth. I would recommend buying this cd cheap used, not new, your $s not worth it.
B0063IH60K|2|when I got this app I was really playing solitaire a lot. I wanted to get it so I wouldn't have to go on the computer so much or play with real cards. when I got on the app it wasn't like the real game at all. you have to get out three cards in the deck so when I pressed the deck it only gave one card! you have<br /> to have three cards! I guess if you like games you can cheet on you would like it but I don't!
B00HUQC3U2|5|Great concert!!
B001N1DPDE|5|Great, solid knife ready for the tough jobs!  This is a very customizable option, from the scales to the sheath.  Love it so far.  After hours of research I chose the Becker BK2 because it seemed the best value and I haven't been disappointed.
B00J2PFPVI|5|Women who can save themselves.  Loved this move for that reason and it was another great Disney movie.  Bought some of the song already and will be watching this movie again.
B0063IH60K|3|don't like all the adds
B009YP9L7U|2|It was one of my first downloads...I didn't realize it was a shallow romance novel. If I knew anyone who liked romance novels I'd probably recommend it.
B00LPUSPRY|2|Superficial and weak.  The action wasn't enough to get past the tentative plot line.  You'd need to read the book first to really get what you're looking a, and it doesn't motivate me to even bother.  It's no Hunger Games by even the longest shot and not worth the money for me.
B000YDAYHC|4|fits a full size too big.... otherwise love the boot.  Just hate the extra room in the toe.
B00DDPZIUG|5|The standard of the narrative is as good as all the others. What a ending though - how can I wait for the next installment. O well no option but patiently I guess. Really enjoyed the book.
B00ATPVA78|5|I just wish it was even longer...I wasn't ready to be finished!  This is my first G5 game...it won't be my last. On to the next one!
B00HXYKYIE|4|Never saw this coming... Make sure to clear your calendar before beginning.  Fantastic mix of animal behavior, love, madness and the paranormal.
B0064BWE8U|4|Sophie has done it again. I loved this light hearted fun book. I did not want to leave the characters and finish the book. Of course it is a bit predictable with the outcome but the fun is in the anticipation of how it is all going to pan out. I needed a fun book to read, as we all do sometimes and this book was the perfect solution !
0345529057|5|Please keep writing, George - We are all waiting :)<br /><br />Smooth transaction
B003XF1XOQ|5|I had read quite a few negative reviews on this final book of \\"The Hunger Games\\" trilogy, but I had already read the first two and was quite impressed by the story line and style of writing. Suzanne Collins did not disappoint! I was riveted and the book pulled me into a different world again, taking me through the twists and turns, all the way to the very end. I am a big fan of \\"The Hunger Games\\" movie, but the books blew me away. It's how the author described the scenes, so direct and intense!<br /><br />I just finished reading the trilogy, I give five stars for all the books! The Hunger Games, Catching Fire and Mockingjay...a writing job well done! Wonderfully entertaining and exciting!
B00PTB7B34|5|This is a game for anyone who likes clash of clans
B007XKEY6Q|5|Enjoy playing with friends connect with friends and family. Also play with people you don't even now. Enjoy having a blast.
B00NX6WZIS|5|One of our favorites; added to our collection.
B000002UA5|4|The live disc of Ummagumma -- as many have said -- is worthy. The focus of this review, however, is on the studio portion of the album, a unique slice of Pink Floyd musical history that true fans will dig.<br /><br />Ummagumma's studio disc was a harmonious attempt on the part of each Pink Floyd member to flaunt his various skills. And although these guys were on the same wavelength throughout, some just had more talent than others. The album leads off with a stodgy instrumental, \\"Sysyphus,\\" written by keyboardist Richard Wright. If Wright's intention was to begin the album like a funeral dirge or the start of some cheesy 1950s horror movie, well, he succeeded grandly. Soon afterward, Wright's muffled, rambling, tuneless piano interlude kicks in, coming off like some wannabe classical piece that doesn't know where it's going. Wright's \\"Part 3\\" is no less tedious, a hodge-podge of noises that are even more forgettable than parts one, two and four. Still, though the music is disjointed and painfully un-melodic, it paves the way for the \\"there's-a-method-in-the-madness\\" style of future, stronger Pink Floyd albums.<br /><br />Roger Waters fares better on his pieces, \\"Grandchester Meadows\\" and \\"Furry Animals,\\" the latter of which bizarrely (and un-ironically) features a bunch of rodents performing vocals. Nature is a definite theme on this disc, as birds, bugs and small animals incessantly chirp away during Waters' segment. \\"Grandchester Meadows\\" is an obscure gem in the Floyd catalog, one of the most subtle, laid-back tunes you'll ever hear. The heavenly guitar picking is barely audible, and Waters' smooth voice is practically right next to you. The maddening animal sound effects on the following song give way to Waters' cockney British rambling, and it's actually one of the more humorous Pink Floyd tunes out there.<br /><br />David Gilmour finally provides some much-needed melodic relief on the intro to his great portion, \\"The Narrow Way,\\" as he strums a pleasant acoustic piece that is as daydreamlike as Waters' earlier song. For some reason, though, he ventures into generic Black Sabbath-like territory on \\"Part 2,\\" simply a churning riff filled with the odd surrounding noises his bandmates so loved. Thankfully, Gilmour's \\"Part 3\\" is probably the best song on \\"Ummagumma,\\" another mellow tune that boasts his great voice and outstanding backing vocals.<br /><br />Save for the fairy tale flute at the start and end of Nick Mason's \\"Grand Vizier's Garden Party,\\" the rest of this disc is an empty mess, just a bunch of tedious electronic drums fading in and out and lulling spaces that make Richard Wright's earlier attempt at music seem masterful. Instead of going it alone, Wright and Mason should have stepped back and assisted their other two bandmates in writing better material the whole way through.<br /><br />Some of these sounds are priceless, forgotten gems in the Floyd catalog, during a period in the band's career when no one was sure which way it would turn. The studio version of \\"Ummagumma\\" is a worthwhile venture, but it's also an acquired taste. If you're willing to sit down and discover how this band sounded more toward the beginning than the end, then this is an interesting album.aydreamlike as Waters' earlier song.

0307472841|1|Mankell was a guarantee for outstanding crime stories including extraordinarily detailed psychology for me. \\"The Man from Beijing\\" was a huge deception. While the story sets off in a promising way, it suddenly gets sidetracked into political and economical issues about China. Contrary to all his other stories, there is The Evil Person, the judge and numerous secondary characters without any interesting traits. The events are highly improbable and thus unconvincing. Lengthy chapters, an even puerile plot in an Around the world of crime in 80 days way. I had difficulties finishing it... Completely disappointing!
B008QTV3X0|5|What makes this show great are the deeply drawn characters; their flaws, their motivations, their humanity.  These aren't perfect agents going after terrorists or cartoon terrorists trying to destroy America.  On both sides of the issue, you see the humanity of the characters; each side displays brutality and altruism, which makes the show much more complex and satisfying.
B00003CXCT|1|The original was great but take my advice and wait for the final revision of this box set. I should come out 2-3 years after this one is released(ala Sept '06). It should also contain another interview with George Lucas in which he proclaims himself god. How can someone so successful be so insecure?
B0087HT36U|3|Too bad it doesn't work for nexus 7. Would give 5 stars for it to work on my device. Works awesome on galaxy s3 though! Download it and try it as faotd, it's addicting like angry birds!
B00AVTMCYW|3|I thought I was watching an 80s teen flick. I never read the acclaimed novel upon which this is based, but I wasn't particularly enthralled with the coming-of-age story line. What is the time setting of this film? 80s? 90s? Today? Seemed unclear, but the music soundtrack would seem to indicate 80s. Yet, the sets or clothing or hairstyles do not say 80s. That was confusing. The plot, such as it is, revolves around a timid freshman who is depressed about something involving his aunt. Hmmm, who died in a car crash. He hangs out with wallflowers: gays, unattractive girls etc., and joins the \\"Rocky Horror Picture Show\\" cast. In the end, he resolves his identity, gets the girl and life marches on. Watch if you liked \\"Pretty in Pink.\\"
B003ODIZL6|3|I like that it comes on my kindle fire but you have to flip through it to the middle letters
B004MC8CA2|5|Use it on my I-Phone, my Android tablet and my PC.  Simply great for free.  Love the audio reading capabilities.
B00004SYWZ|5|I have to say I just got it a couple of days ago, so it's quite a short time for me to get caught by a new cd, this one did it. I think it's the most powerful comeback in years!  ( and I can tell 'cuz I have been an a-ha  lover since their early days).<br />When I started listening to Minor  Earth/Major Sky, Summer Moved On and The Sun Never Shone that Day, I felt  chills coming up and down my spine. That moment I knew, there's only one  style that can not be compared to other bands, perhaps it's the  songwritting or the feeling I can't describe when I listen to their music.<br />So I guess some time appart between them was worth it guys! Take a  listen to this one, it's somewhat amazing!
B000AYEL6U|5|You thought you liked Pride & Prejudice, Emma, Persuasion, JAne Eyre etc etc...well you are about to enter another level of period drama heaven....RUN don't walk to buy this one, buy two, because you will be lending it out to all your friends...  Why?  The most compelling story from an excellent novel, the tightest, leanest script by Sandy Welch, the superb cinematography and production design, make this the best period drama I have ever seen, it makes the others pale into comparision.    The actors are a fantastic ensemble, including the superb Sinead Cusack as Mrs Thornton the matriach, Daniela Denby-Ashe is the spirited and lovely heroine Margaret, and Richard Armitage who plays Mr Thornton is the most talented, brooding, smouldering, intelligent, moving and compelling leading man it has been my pleasure ever to witness.....this man was robbed of a BAFTA - he is nothing short of magnificent...  and it's not just for women, it's a sad, funny, romantic, stirring story of loss, love and struggle that anyone can enjoy.. and I believe you will enjoy this.
B00AESN8XY|5|A very realistic SIM of how a global pandemic starting in a populous under developed country could quickly infect the world.
B008LZHA3G|5|I love every song on this cd. I listen to it at least omce a day. Bob's voice has changed, and I love the gravelly sound. He still has that spark that makes him Bob Dylan.
B00L9B7IKE|4|I enjoyed this book.  Very easy reading,  mild sexual content, and not too much violence.  I<br />would recommend it.
B006Y5EDRG|5|I really enjoyed this series. Great characters, conflict, and song. The story line is interesting. For those that love broadway, this is a for you!
B009KS4XRO|1|This was the most boring app! I guess it wouldn't have been so bad if you could win every I once  in a while! I played for almost a week several times a day and only bingoed once...it was deleted and I found a better bingo app!
B00000DC10|5|I haven't been able to find this CD and I don't have a credit card so i'm not gonna order it, but what i have heard is really good. System of a Down is good, buy the System of a Down CD. Nib High Football RULES!!!
B00HPYMVD8|4|An exciting, thrilling and full-of-suspense read.  As always, Baldacci’s stories are gripping and are fast movers.  The good ol’ USA vs North Korea is the theme. The Target did not disappoint in this regard.  What I found different about this book and extremely interesting though,  was Baldacci’s detailed account of the concentration camps in North Korea.  Admitting my ignorance, I had to do a bit of my own research on North Korea in order to fully appreciate his narrative.  I highly recommend this book for both Baldacci’s storyline and his “learning” material on North Korea.
B004JXXKWY|5|Amazingly well written about a subject that can truly claim the dubious distinction of being complicated than rocket science without being of any relevance to the world
B00CL68BK2|5|Wonderful jobs by Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert DiNero, Jacki Weaver, and Chris Tucker. Very deserving of the nominations made and awards that were won.
B000002LHX|4|For the times this album in my opinion sales were boosted by the success of the film.    \\"Batman\\" soundtrack fully produced and recorded by Prince is by far one of the 90's best soundtracks, however it is a B-list album with B-list songs.    Prince went out of his way to ensure this album had his personal touch to it and he succeeded at it masterfully.    The album is a mix of Funk and R&B. The only track worth really listening to is \\"Scandalous\\" which is a slow ballad that has Prince's signature pure fallsetto.    At anyrate, this album is worth buying for any Prince fan. But, if a friend has it and wants to get get rid of it, just get it for free!  This album is however extremely hard to find on P2P networks, so forget about that avenue of approach!    \\"On the One\\"
B004T5R2HQ|5|Excellent app
B000063DFN|5|Ah, what's to say that hasn't yet been said?  When you look up metal in the dictionary, you'll see Maiden right next to it.  And if you don't, then buy a revised copy.  This is the definitive sound of everything that ever has been and everything that ever will be metal.  Put simply, Maiden are legends, and Powerslave is one of their best efforts.  Incredible riffing, mindblowingly complex drumming, killer solos, and that incredible power surge of Bruce Dickinson - this band has a sense of scale, and that scale is big.  I can't even try to pick individual highlights, but the last song, the epic \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\" is pure genius!  Certain parts of that song give me chills like no other.  To wrap this short review up (and I know Maiden deserve a longer one), go out, buy Powerslave, crank up the stereo, and have yourself a good time.  Really, it can't offer anything less.  Not that we'd expect it to anyways. <br /> <br />10/10 <br /> <br />PS - Sharon Osbourne, her stupid daughter, \\"Big Dave\\" and that lame excuse for a band Bury Your Dead can all jump off a bridge for all I care.  No one f**** with Maiden and gets away with it!  Up the Irons, cuz Ozzfest is now dead!
B0058UXHHK|5|I really loved this book!  It was a great mixture of mystery and romance!  Rose is a great character and i really fell in love with her!  Definitely recommend!
B00I2TV3NO|4|Fun but not genius
B0001L3MI0|2|ended up being mediocre at best.   <br /> <br />When I saw the trailers for this movie, I thought this was going to be one of those great movies that really caused the viewer to pause and consider the possibility that alien invasion really could occur--and on a global scale, with huge space ships that could hover over entire cities.  The scenes of the huge shadows looming over entire cities were ominous and terrifying.  The idea that an alien species could simply pick and choose a planet that had resources that they needed--and take them by exterminating the entire population (much like mankind has done in the past) actually lends even more credibility to the concept of what I thought this movie was going to be about. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this movie ended up being a comedy for the most part.  With the ridiculous sub-plots, silly one-liners, and cute-and-cuddly ending, I walked away from this movie with great disappointment.  This movie could have been an epic masterpiece, but the producers decided to go with the \\"Hollywood formula\\" and ended up creating a typical, predictable yawnfest.   <br />
B000002TYK|5|Followed by &quot;The Color and the Shape&quot; which is their second masterpiece. Anyway, this is the debut Foo Fighters album and really shows Dave Grohl's all-around talent as the demo for this album was entirely made  by him. This albums is full of distinctive songs, from the mellow, playful  &quot;Big Me&quot; to the thrash-punk &quot;Wattershed.&quot; This album  also produced several excellent videos, which has become somewhat of a  trademark of the band. This album is a definite stand-out from the  bottomless pit of alternative albums and deserves a place in the library of  any fan of the genre.
B006VRDZ44|4|Very good. Graphically gory at times but great storyline and dialogue
B004XQO90E|5|Fun Sci-Fi action flick!
B00H7Y9CKG|5|Thanks for the game yea love playing it.but I have a question how come when I get to level 10 it dose ghostwriting were I see one little spot move.
B000002J0B|5|Houses of the Holy is a good album for any mood. A lot of the songs are fun, upbeat and catchy, some of the others are slower for mellower moods, and overall this is a great album. E Produced Zeppelin classics like \\"Over The Hills...\\", \\"Dancing Days\\", and my favorite LZ song \\"The Ocean\\".
B001NHNG64|5|Good book
B007VUCAVO|5|It's nice to know how much charge I've got left depending on what I'm doing - reading, surfing, playing games - shows as much or as little information as you want - you can just look at the pic of the battery or see a graph on how often you charge and how long it takes. Especially helpful knowing how long you will need to leave it plugged in to fully charge
B004SBS8LA|5|My husband is an Angry BIrds junkie - I am an AB widow! He is happy and that's all that counts. Thanks - I think!
B00GTCECVG|5|One of the most addicting games I have ever played. Great graphics and there is always something to do! You can never get bored. Just GREAT!!!
B0007TKNL0|1|I am so glad I rented The Phantom of the Opera before considering purchasing it.  This would have been a fairly decent movie had Gerard Butler not been cast as the Phantom.  My ex's caterwauling to the Broadway CD was more pleasant-sounding!  The only thing that was salvagable was the plotline of Christine Daae and Raoul.  That was well-played, and not overdone, which was the downside of the Broadway musical.   <br />If this had been a strictly acting movie, Gerard Butler would be a halfways decent Phantom.  But his singing killed the mood for me.
B00FRVH3V6|5|this installment of the series lives up to the predecessors.  I didn't want to stop reading it.  great job Rick!
B007IXWL2C|5|Still loved the book but not as much as the first two of the trilogy.  Glad I read all three.
B009UX2YAC|5|Subway surf is sooooooo addictive. I absolutely love subway surf<br />And the themes that they do. TEAM SUBWAY SURF!!!!!!!! This game is much better<br />Than Temple Run, or any other game.
B00946WMXY|1|Enjoyed the movie,  but the sound quality is horrible!  Will be in touch with a rep...
B00019GG1M|5|I used to be into pop. And while a lot of people I know who like pop also like this album, it really changed something about me. <br />I needed the distorted guitars, so I bought a 12 Stones album. Then I just kept going up a step, and up and up, and now I'm into metal and hardcore. But it all started here. <br /> <br />This is still a good album. <br /> <br />THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT EVANESCENCE: Amy Lee actually has a good voice, the band can play instruments, Amy doesn't have to dress like a slut to sell music, she doesn't use language in any of the songs (except \\"Thoughtless, which is a Korn cover)they cover spiritual issues which some consider to be \\"Christian\\", and they can just write really good stuff. <br /> <br />THE QUESTIONABLE STUFF: They're not \\"true\\" goth, the word \\"bleeding\\" is too overused, some of the songs sound the same, I expected the album to be darker than it was, and they try too hard to prove that they're not a Christian band while they're practically inviting the title. <br /> <br />But they still have a thumbs up from me. \\"Tourniquet\\" is my favorite song on the album, cause it helped me through a rough time. But it was originally done by a death metal band called Soul Embraced. I downloaded the song, and it sounds so...uh...different. It's a guy growling it basically. Would probably scare you teeny girls, so listen to this version first. I also really like \\"Imaginary\\" cause it has a lot of different instruments in it, and it has pretty verses, and a cool bridge with a choir. I basically like all the songs, but these two I like the best. <br /> <br />I originally got this on my fourteenth birthday with my birthday money, and by my fifteenth birthday had mananged to break it. So I rebought it, and guess what? It had a bonus track! The \\"My Immortal\\" which I really liked was magically on the end of the album. So I guess I got something out of spending a whole 'nother fifteen bucks for a CD I previously owned. <br /> <br />If you don't have Originalready, you need to download it. The songs on there, in my opinion, are better than these ones. There are tons of covers they did on Limewire too. And a bunch of songs that aren't even on Origin. <br /> <br />Peace out.
B001N3EZW2|5|Love it.  One of my old time favorite movie.  Very clear on my Kindle. I know it doesn't have the new tech....it's from back in the day, but I still like it.
1451695195|5|Dr. Alexander writes a compelling, credible book about his experience with the transcendent. It reads easily; highly recommended. Good book.
B007PTJOV0|5|leps world is a really fun game. everyone who likes Mario games should get it. overall leps world is a very fun game
B0000636UN|5|This CD is being released at a perfect time....spring/summer. Most of the tunes are &quot;light&quot; and &quot;fun.&quot;  Almost every song has a star guest Stevie Nicks, Lenny Kravitz, Natalie Maines, etc. But, none seem obtrusive or pushed.  Sheryl maintains her now classic and recognizeable vocals.  If you like her previous work (Tuesday Night Music Club in particular)  you should like this.  If you are looking for something grounbreaking, it is not here.
B00008BXJ6|5|Some bands material just gets better with age.  High Voltage shows not only what was to come but much furhter beyond other bands AC/DC were in 1976.  Angus already had his chops well rehearsed and Bon was already a force to be reckoned with.  Sad that he was headed on a path to final destruction and death.  This album is chalked full of classics destined for constant radio and LIVE rotation with T.N.T., Live Wire, The Jack, and Its a long Way to the Top
B003730LRY|4|A funny take on the old T.V. show of the same name. Well made with a great cast of characters.
0979019710|5|The only word I can think of when I try to think about what to write in this review is AWESOME! This book is inspiring me to become a morning person and that is saying a LOT! As I read it, I can see so much potential for implementing the SAVERS. Let's face it, we all have morning routines even if it's hit snooze 20 times, use the restroom, get dressed, brush teeth, drag myself to the office ...Why not learn how to make your mornings productive and fulfilling!<br /><br />If you want to be inspired to the best version of yourself that you can be, grab it now and read it immediately!
B007J4T2G8|1|I'm so angry that I wasted my time and money on this waste of a book. I wish i would have known that this book is a porno that sounds like it's written by a 15 year old girl. I have no clue how this book got any good reviews at all!
B001KVAMM4|5|thanks.
B0054JZC6E|3|It has okay games, some of them are a little tricky to complete.  the controls are sketchy on some of the games and instructions don't always make sense.
B00IK1NTCW|3|Great tools, but takes forever to open in a reasonably fast smartphone (more than 5 seconds)
0440238609|5|This is a true fantasy series. However unlike many fantasy series it rejects the spiritual in a lot of ways and the protagonists are in conflict with the representatives of the spiritual rather than being subtly backed by \\"godlike forces\\". I read a lot of fantasy and I find it helpful to place this series in terms of maturity, content and detail, between Harry Potter and Narnia (on the low end) and Lord of the Rings and Wheel of Time on the high end. Note: That is not a ranking of enjoy-ability. The books are highly enjoyable and one of my favorite series of all time.
B006LSZECO|3|Hated the ending.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Love it..so easy to use
B000GIXEIG|4|I see a lot of reviews that say that the movie is not close to the epic poem.  Well, duh, that is one of the longest poems in history, and you have lots of interesting interpretations.  Michael Crichton's \\"Eaters of the Dead\\" which was turned into \\"The 13th Warrior\\" which was another good spin on the tale but not close to the poem either.  I mean there are some works of literature that can't be reduced to two or three hours of screen time.  That being said.  I thought this movie was pretty good, its not the best I have ever seen but I thought that the idea of making Grendel someone who has feelings and emotion was a good idea.  I was always terrified of the thought of Grendel as a girl, I read the poem and was frightened sometimes to think of that terrible monster.  Stellan S.  is a favorite of mine, he is what I called an under appreciated actor, always very transporting in his parts but never a star.  A great character actor.  As for Gerard B. well, let's just say that I have watched him from Mrs. Brown, where I said, \\"Who's is the cutie?\\" through Attila and now into 300...as always, he is a feast for the eyes but a great actor as well.<br /><br />All in all it was a good movie to watch on a stormy Saturday afternoon.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Love my chromecast... since Christmas 2013 I have gotten 4 or 5 of these to give away or put on my tv. I use the mirroring function with Chrome on my chromebook. I try to tell everyone I know to get this instead of Apple TV because it's budget friendly and does pretty much everything an Apple TV could do. I don't have a large online collection of my own videos, mostly streaming off Youtube or Netflix. Also good for casting tv shows on TV without subscribing to cable. Honestly for $35 you have nothing to lose. One of them has broken but not really its fault... I had it bent so the hdmi connector fell off so I got another one. I'm a heavy user.
0786838655|5|This book showed up promptly and in great condition.  I'm using it as my teacher edition so I can take notes to lead literature circles.
B00VRYCGLO|4|Good game.
B0082EOJYE|3|This movie was creative in concept, but the &#34;silent treatment&#34; didn't work for me. I am rather surprised it won the best picture oscar last year. I would recommend this picture only to college film majors.The lack of audible dialogue made this movie very tedious.
B00I29VGMC|5|Make sure you have plenty of time to read, this is one I could not put down. Such a wonderfully written story of love and loss.
B008JFUO36|5|Excellent DVD movie, fast shipping
B004LOMB2Q|5|Have this app on both my Kindle Fire and iPhone and I love the way it synchs the data to both devices.
B005M92MJ6|5|Personally, I am not a fan of long winded reviews, so I will keep it short and to the point.....  ...Another laser guided endeavor from Maynard James Keenan and as always it fills a void that you never thought was there....spend the 8 bucks and you my friend will posses another small yet filling slice of his absolute brilliant song writing and lyrical abilities.....  Rock on Mr. Keenan, rock on!!!   Oh, and his wine is pretty damn tasty as well!!!  If he starts producing cigars and scotch, I will be one happy consumer!!  Cheers!!
B00632HWOG|5|Ok
B0084670FU|1|worst movie I've ever seen.  Just plain &#34;crap&#34;.  Gross and lousy plot. subtitles are not what I want in a movie
006202406X|1|I wish I could erase all the time I spent on the novels in this trilogy and never think of them again. I thought it would be a series that I would introduce to my daughter when she was old enough, along with a few other of my select favorites. I was counting down days until I could see the movie to enhance my whole experience. Now I will not see the movie, including the Divergent movie even though I loved the book. I am done with these characters. I have now gotten rid of my books that I was saving. I have told those that I recommended the series to, to take them off their reading list. I will certainly not be reading anything by this author in the future. It was such a waste of my precious time. I am a stay at home mom without much time for reading, so when I read something I expect it to be good, engaging, and to leave me feeling like there was a purpose. It can have tragedy, but overall it should leave the reader feeling good about the time you got to spend with the characters. This did not.
0307476464|5|Bought this one for a secret santa because I loved the book so much. It is very Japanese in the style of writing, but I was enthralled the whole time.
B003YFIUW8|5|This was a very interesting peek into someone who has been kidnapped and locked up. I love Ma and what an incredible job she did with her son, Jack, in such horrid conditions. I also loved that everything wasn't perfect and rosy once they escape. This book sure isn't sunny, but it's heartwrenching and thought provoking. It shows real emotions of fear, hate, frustration and no sugar coating. I intented this book as a full weekend read but finished it in one day. I just had to know the end. The book is written mostly from the perspective of the 5 year old. Some had issues with his grammar, but he's 5, so I find their annoyance with it unreasonable. It really isn't all that bad at all.
B00A6CCF0K|5|VIVA Stephen King! &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34; humanized the process of &#34;passing on&#34; by giving us Dan at his best. It's a perfect ending to the 1977 classic, &#34;Shining&#34;
B0086700CM|5|I can see now why so many people have begged amazon to get this app. The permissions are stellar and so is game play. 100% addictive can't stop! Can't believe it's free. And yes its completely free there is no need to spend money. I haven't even wanted or thought about spending money. They could charge 2.99 for this game and I would buy it again! Very fun! And no reason for suspicious reviews the game is just that good.
B007PTJOV0|5|its just like awesome you should really get this app I play it every day. I never got bored playing this
B0094BB4TW|2|Doesn't play videos, (always kicks me) can't send pics or all the symbols. Guess I should have got a ipad.
B00992CF6W|5|I would say this is the best game on my kindle HD. You get to build and create anything you want. I give this game 5 stars
0307405095|5|I purchased this for my Mom. She loves it !
B00E00PEGQ|5|We saw this at the theater and enjoyed it enough to purchase.  Our son loved it and so did we.
B002N5N5LG|5|Within the first three episodes of this show there are references to Bill Murray, John Hughes and they play an Aimee Mann song, I was sold on this show right then and there. This is one of the strongest first seasons of a show I've seen in a long time. This show is a classic like Family Guy or It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, the kind of show where you can watch the same episodes over and over again and see things you didn't notice before and laugh like you did the first time you watched it. This show is cast so well, this is one of those shows that just works. I'm really glad it's not shot on a crappy half set with a laugh track, I hate that s#@%. They need to put this out on Blu-Ray already, so for now this is as good as it gets. I bought this for my sister and my Dad, and I'll probably buy it again for someone else. I think everyone should watch this show at least once.
0552565970|5|I purchased this book for my niece, her teacher read it to her class in school and she wanted a copy for her own. It came quickly and in great condition.
B005LAJ1O0|5|Watched this with Surround sound in its entirety in one weekend. Bravo!!! No wonder why Jessica Lang won an Emmy. It is completely captivating from the first episode till the end. Am currently watching Season 2 and it is totally different, clapping for all involved from the writers, producers, actors, special affects, all of it.
B00KTDD69A|3|I was enjoying this game and then came the request for money to continue......way too fast. Sorry,but I don't appreciate being held up.So no five stars for you pal.
B00V3MY10E|4|It is the type of book that is hard to put down.  A good commentary on how the public can be manipulated. Also, strange as it seems, given the topic and all, the book is very funny.
B0057XSCJG|5|This is a good story about how you can not know a person but just what you see on the outside, it's the inside that counts. You can be beautiful on the outside and totally ugly on the inside or ugly on the outside and totally beautiful on the inside.
B0089EHWQE|5|I am not quite finished with it, but I love it.  A magnificent way to live vicariously. It is magnificent!
B00005JKCF|5|I went into the theater expecting some mild entertainment, something that was totally overdone, silly, and [not real], and not like the Spider-Man comics at all. However, I was SO delighted to discover that I had been hugely wrong. <br />First of all, Tobey Maguire, despite all the criticism he's had, was excellent as Peter Parker. He was so dorky and lovable, I just couldn't help but crack up watching him running for the bus and snapping \\"pictures for the newspaper\\" of Mary-Jane in the museum. He may be a superhero by the end of the movie, but he's still a nerd when he takes his mask off. Tobey Maguire is always going to be a nerd. That's why I love him.<br />Secondly, Sam Raimi blew me away! He didn't try to make Spider-Man over-realistic or new-millenium-cool. He simply captured the essence of what Spider-Man really is--outrageous, impossible, yet incredibly enviable stunts, the sense of victory over injustice, and all the little details down to the random passerby that points and shouts: \\"Look! It's Spider-Man!\\" It just had, as someone said below, this perfect B-movie quality that was completely irresistible. I totally felt like I was watching one of those nostalgic old superhero movies from decades ago, expecting a POW! and BANG! to pop up on the screen any second. <br />This is really Spider-Man at its truest and purest. It's no wonder it shot the box-office record up to [$] in its first weekend! Go see it. You won't be disappointed, I promise.
B003XF1XOQ|2|The author made katniss weak and I didn't like it she kept second guessing her self and very overly emotional. And the fact that the author decide to kill Prim was lame when I read that part I wanted to stop reading but I had already bought the book so I had to keep on reading how this now lame ass book was goin to end  and it got no better she never talks to Gale again or seen her mother. I thought putting her and Peeta together wasn't a good choice thumbs down on that. I read the second book catching fire and jus love it goin into the three book I expected nothing less than great but it didn't compare its been three weeks sence I finish the book and I'm still disappointed.
0307950689|3|Dan Brown is one of those authors whose hero jumps in and saves the world at the last minute. We saw it in the DiVinci Code, a fantasy loosely based on a previous diatribe, Baigent, Leigh and Lincoln's Holy Blood, Holy Grail for which they sued Brown with the case being thrown outta court and both Brown and the trio selling a lot more of their books. Then, we saw it again in Angels and Demons. Here, once again we meet the professor of Symbology, Robert Langdon this time tangled up with a bunch of Masons who are involved with the CIA, the cops and a nutcase Uebermensch villain. The story is end-to-end madcap action and frustration with twists and turns as only a good yarn-spinner like Brown can do.<br /><br />Aside from a new toybox of symbols to play with and a change of faces of villains and sidekicks, the same story told to us in his two previous Langdon adventures is served up again on a different platter. Pure fantasy? Of course. That's why we buy fiction. Same story? Yep. But that's OK. There are hundreds of ways to make spaghetti and I nearly always like spaghetti.<br /><br />Brown takes great liberty with his symbology and for an anthropologist, linguist and mythologist, I can get a little impatient with his fast and loose handling of the tools and concepts that are the stock of my trade and profession but I keep buying his books.<br /><br />So, I guess that makes us both winners.
B000N2HBSO|5|This extremely well-written book provides so much more than just the facts of Lincoln's life.  You almost feel like you are standing in the background watching his life unfold.  You understand just how perceptive a man Lincoln really was and how and why he commanded so much respect from virtually all who came in contact with him.  I can't think of too many other 900 page history books that I have had difficulty putting down.  A truly inspiring book about an amazing man as told by those around him.  The author has taken thousands of facts and woven them into an interest-sustaining story that the consummate story teller, Lincoln, would have found marvelous!  I STRONGLY recommend this book to anyone, but if you have any interest in history and have't read this book, by all means read it!
B0059GVBHG|5|Love this movie. Dark, gritty and intense.
B006MW3V6U|5|As there are already several lengthy and worthy reviews, I'll just say that this is like watching the longest, most entertaining and moving film ever made.  You never want it to end.
B00IKZX1ZI|1|Game is super fun and beautiful BUT just last night alone we spent $36 for power-ups (similar cost per night since we accepted/chose the &#34;FREE&#34; game).  Way too expensive to play regularly.
B0000VD04M|5|Johnny Depp loves to take the off-beat campy roles and he picked the cream of the crop with \\"Ed Wood!\\"  Weird, funny, campy, well-acted and just downright goofy at times, it's totally enjoyable for people who like something a little on the dark side.  One of my favorite Depp flicks.
B00FGM0IEU|5|Spectacular story grabbing the roots of music and sharing the intoxicating influence it had on music loved by so many.
B00K7C17QW|4|The game is fun but it takes a long time to recharge the energy.  The scenes are fairly easy to get around and find the hidden objects.
B008G3N71W|3|Wow....  This book was a bit over the top for me.  There's titilating and then there's icky.  This one was icky, just icky.  I read on, hoping for a redemptive quality where there was none.  BDSM I can navigate but this fetish is out there and asserting that self-actualization results from it is laughable at best.  Perhaps the author could use some discipline!
B0002JJBZY|4|I couldn't give Star Trek any less than 4 stars simply because it's Star Trek, a show that I've been watching since I was a baby, and has had an immense influence on my life.  The Original Series is an important show, and finally being able to get it in an all-in-one package for a (fairly) reasonable price has taken too long.  There was no way I as a rabid Star Trek fan wasn't going to beg for this for Xmas.  I'm glad I have it in my collection.<br /><br />But if I could give a separate rating to the quality of the transfer, I'd give it 2 stars.  How ironic that a show that deals with humans using technology to achieve and explore has been released by humans witholding technology to maximize profit.  Despite a new, cleaned up digital mix of the audio, the video portion of the DVD's still contains the little scratches and video noise that my original videotapes possessed when I bought them in the 80's.  There have been too many old movies and TV shows digitally remastered and beautified for me to believe that they couldn't clean these episodes up and give us better picture quality. It's a crime that Paramount continues to milk the original Trek dynasty like this.<br /><br />It's quite obvious that there will be yet another re-release of the series down the road, but I can't see waiting any longer.  The Harry Mudds have won again.
B0073LWEXK|1|Wouldn't get past the 2nd welcome screen.  Just kept booting me out.  Too bad because it looked like it would be a beautiful and interesting game to play.
B00BFUUMO8|5|The game is good but the newest one, Jurassic World, isn't available for Kindle fire hd 7 or whatever I have. Then I went to write a comment about how it's not available for Kindle and it wouldn't let me write a comment. But other people who hadn't gotten the game could write a comment. It made no sense.
B008JGSM6G|5|this game is great for people who like puzzles. love to do it at night to zone out over and give me some time with just this.
B001N18HOQ|4|I thought this was a pretty good set, however I think a few things are missing from the unplugged show though.  My only real complaint about the set is the fact that on the dvd it only shows Eddie, Stone, Jeff and Mike on the dvd menu, what about Dave Abbruzzese? I kinda thought that was pretty rude, he was an awesome drummer and had a lot of input in the band.  I noticed they also blanked him on the photos contained in rearview mirror (the best of)  Anyway the remix cd was cool and it was awesome to see unplugged on dvd even if it has been cut.
B002G1K82Q|5|We had this DVR'd for well over a year and watched it repeatedly.  Even though an enormous time during the movie, the characters are &#34;high&#34;, the music and the story are amazing.
B00AESN8XY|5|This is hands-down one of the Best Strategy games I've found so far. I had mixed feelings at first based on the name &amp; concept of the game. However, after watching my husband play, I had to try it out. I found it was a lot more fun &amp; thought provoking than I expected, and highly addictive!! I would definitely recommend this to everyone over 18.
0380788624|3|I had lukewarm expectations for this book and wasn't let down. Unlike his earlier books, which I think will remain timeless, imaginative, inspiring, and thoughtful (the Mouse Army in Diamond Age is one of the most inspiring  and meaningful concepts I've read and made me believe again that computers  may do something good and revolutionary for this world), this one reeks of  second hand knowledge, macho robotic characters, and cliches. The writing  is also not great, reading more or less like some casual email (too many  paragraphs starting with &quot;Anyways,&quot; among other  things.)<br />Stephenson was trying too hard and some of his examples sound  clever but are very one dimensional in that especially irritating geeky  way; the self-righteous geek arguments in this book (IE the  &quot;information highway&quot; vs TCP/IP [a transport protocol that is  irrelevant when considering the effects of the net]) contrast poorly with  Stephenson's earlier wide vision views and is along the lines of pointless  techno name-dropping. And while I'm hardly an expert on history or  cryptography, some of the information presented in the book is wrong  (Turing did not invent the Bombes) or even laughable (excuse me, I have to  boot up BeOS now so I can view some JPEGS.. yeah right). <br />If you glorify  geeks and don't have that much technical knowledge then perhaps you will  really enjoy this book but otherwise I think it is simply a sign that  Stephenson is no longer a inspired writer and must now move on to the  &quot;career&quot; stage where he is compelled by publishers to write the  equivilant of current events mini series/travelogues full of content  dictated by his fans. Not the end of the world because I'm sure he still  has lots to say but I hope he finds a way to move in a different direction  or at least drops the geek romanticism because he can be truly an inspiring  writer.
B00AA7O6QC|5|AWESOME!!!!  Just as good as the first one!
0887307280|5|Taught me why businesses don't work and how to make them do just that. By being the CEO and not the technician is what is most important.
B007REV4YI|4|This is, without a doubt, the best Bond film ever.  Daniel Craig is at his best.  Full of action and great story line.
B006MW3UZW|5|This is without a doubt the best series I've ever watched!  All of the characters and the actors are fantastic!
0385341008|4|What a pleasure of a book to read.  Particularly, if you enjoy reading books in the format of a series of letters and communications, you will find this as pleasing as Helene Hanff's 84 Charing Cross Road.  I hope that, like Charing Cross Rd., this will become a movie, too.<br /><br />This is a quick read,sadly.  I was left wanting more, and wondering how the characters lives progressed.<br /><br />The authors evoked fond memories of wonderful, childhood holidays in Guernsey, and they also protrayed its German occupation, well.<br /><br />This is a bittersweet and gentle book, plan on adding it to your \\"must read\\" list.
B00DA6YEKS|5|Great book
B00BMT9C84|4|This was an enjoyable movie. My daughter and I laughed a lot! My 20 year old sons had watched it and recommended it.
B002MW50KO|5|This album is a Christmas Classic. I didn't know what to expect but again Dylan comes through with another great album. The songs are very well done and very listenable to even someone who is not a huge Dylan fan. I guess the the best thing is that the message is clear. We should follow his lead and help the less fortunate in America and around the world. So buy this album and maybe give a little to.
B00JJV4QZG|5|David Nicholls' Us beautifully captures the details of a just happy enough romance, wedding and marriage that culminates in a woebegone and funny Grand Tour of Europe for a middle class English family and their teenage son.  Nicholls recalls the best of the U.S.'s John Updike in this novel, offering the torrent of practical and emotional details that limn lives and relationships and capture triumphs and regrets.  Highly recommended.
B000063DIR|4|If you are reading this review and contemplating a purchase, buy it. Yes Ozzy re-recorded the drums and bass (It is not badly done at all) and that is wrong, I agree...But Randy Rhoads guitar sound is FREAKIN AMAZING ON THIS ALBUM VERSION and if you can only get this version don't deny yourself a masterpiece. And FYI I have BOTH versions and this one sounds superior to the unbiased ear.
0307463745|5|Covers so much of what I have learned building two companies.  Great read for anyone in business, whether they work for themselves, or have a job for the &#34;man.&#34;
B00LEIT6K2|4|Would be great to play longer before purchasing
B0007TKNL0|4|The musical was already amazing, breathtaking and beautiful masterpiece.  Now the Film, directed by Joel Schumacher, is a wonderfull experience that will take your soul and pulls it into it's world of lust, passion and endless love.    The story is so spectacular, ammazing, and written with such passion, it will take your breath away.   Andrew Lloyd Webbers masterpiece is as timeless as love itself and will hold your breath the whole time.    The movie has spectacular sets, beautiful music, songs that you'll never forget, and a cast that hits the bullseye.    Gerard Butler, the one I actually never considerd playing the phantom, does a fantastic job! He portrais the phantom with perfect emotion, passion, lust and hate. He knows how to portray the clouded soul of the phantom with great acting.    Emmy Rossum: Wow! A true beauty with a voice of an angel portrais the lovely Christine, the woman who enchants the phantom's hart. She acts wonderfull.   Just like Gerard Butler: she makes the film work.    I've finished watching this movie for the first time about an half an hour ago, and the songs are still echoing in my mind. The scenes are still playing in my toughts.  So do you want to see a beautiful musical drama: this movie is definitly the adventure for you.  Full of emotion, drama, lust, pasion and most of all, full of love and music.    Spectacular...    A film that I will never forget.
B0007MWZEK|1|When I tried to turn on sweeper battery was dead.  I charged per instructions still no luck. Tried to contact the seller and they wouldn't even respond back to exchange for a battery that worked. Very disappointed in seller and product.

B003O86FMW|5|I love all three of these books and so far both of the movies. It is Definitely a great read!
B007MNV5WU|1|Been excited all day for this game, major disappoint Its been trying to download for the pass 3 hours on my kindle fire. Starting to think I got jacked on the $2.99 price already hmmm...
B0067Q04AM|5|Outstanding.  Having been an avid Glasper listener since 2006, I was inexplicably reluctant to jump on this offering despite the hype. In retrospect I was struggling to categorize Glasper beyond young jazz giant - a condition Black Radio is specifically designed to deconstruct.  My musical tastes are highly eclectic so I have to admit I was surprised at my early reluctance.  Much has already been written about the gifted musical talents guesting with the Experiment and it's all true.  The craftsmanship is simply astonishing as is the creativity.  The verbal chiding we receive for having been musically dumbed down is admittedly self indulgent, but I suppose it's been festering for quite a while and needed the outlet.  Fine, as long as Black Radio follows, I will endure the unnecessary chiding. For what RG has done here is nothing short of a game changer- a clarion call to musicians to create their unconstrained best.  All I can say is 'thank you' and 'yes, we are listening'.  Album of The Year contender without question.
B00MYPUDMY|5|If you like Slipknot, you will love this album. Every single track will have you hooked.
B0034G4OYA|4|Over all surprisingly good. Sold graphics funny dialogue and a good story that is not scary in any way so if you have kids don't fret they won't have nightmares from this.
B0055PSKE8|5|A very welcome and useful addition to our Kindle Fire HDX reference library. (Purchased as a FAOTD.)
0345505387|1|Unfair for me to review this book as I returned it to the Bookstore.  It was not what I expected.
0394800184|5|This was one of my favorite picture books when I was little, and now I get to read it to my children. I love the simple, adorable pictures. My daughter loves all the animals in the book, and my son loves it when I make a loud \\"SNORT\\" noise. The animals talk so you can make funny voices for them. It's great that the scary \\"snort\\" turns out to be the hero. My son is four and my daughter is two, and they both love it.
B005SEYOXW|5|Simply brilliant from the screenplay, casting director, on-screen direction, effects, and the authentic execution from the cast members.
0684803356|5|Usually, even with the best books, I would say that &quot;this book is not for everyone.&quot;  Not so with this novel.  I truly believe that this book IS for everyone.  Unlike so much other 20th century literature, one need not be well read to get something out of it.   <br />    The story is of  two of man's most cherished and hated traditions:  Love and War.   The  tragedy is that we have had so much of the latter and so little of the  former.   We see much of both in &quot;For Whom The Bell Tolls.&quot;  It  is a tender story of two young people who just want to live a  &quot;normal&quot; life together during the Spainish civil war, but who are  prevented from doing thus due to their being in the wrong place at the  wrong time.<br />It is incredulous to me that there were other reviewers who  found this book &quot;boring.&quot;  I can only surmise that anyone who  would find a novel such as this boring will not find anything  &quot;exciting&quot; unless it has Arnold Scharzenegger swinging around a  machine gun.  But that, I believe, is the fault of the reader's lack of  attention span and cannot be blamed on Hemingway.<br />The author writes that  &quot;The world is a fine place and worth the fighting for and I hate very  much to leave it.&quot;  I would agree.  Anyone else who agrees, and anyone  who has a passion and zest for life should read this book.  One of the best  examples of American literature in the 20th century.

B0000214F2|5|how can someone mix humour and death so bitterly as Robin Williams does in this film and make us want to watch it over and over?  because it is a classic boy meets girl and falls in comedic love story, but the  complications death sets out are shocking and needed.  It seems to say a  lot about or world today.
B009GEEMLY|5|so good
B00005NI5Y|5|&quot;Love and Theft&quot; is bound for another grammy for Mr. Dylan.  This stuff will &quot;bust your brains out&quot;.  I like this collection more than &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot;.  It reaches much higher on the musical front.  The lyrics are compelling and typical for the greatest American poet.  <br />I've been listening to Bob Dylan all 41 yrs of my life.  I've been through all the transformations,  all the reinventions, all the albums, and I can say truthfully that Bob Dylan is still the greatest artist of our time and indeed of all time.  This collection of songs is a strong testimony of that fact.  <br />Highlights for me were &quot;Mississippi&quot;, &quot;Po Boy&quot;, &quot;Moonlight&quot; and &quot;Summer Days&quot;.  They take you on a journey through American musical history.  Dylan is quick to note his musical influences and blends his material with theirs with ease.  He could easily have been recording this material in Memphis with Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee, Carl Perkins and Elvis Pressly.  Or out in Oklahoma with Bob Wills or in Texas with Buddy Holly.  It just fits!  <br />My favorite track by far is &quot;High Water&quot;.  I believe it will become a Bob Dylan standard if their is such a thing.  It's one of those songs that will bite you.  &quot;profits dropping in the streets like baloons made out of lead.&quot;  &quot;It's rough out there.  High water every where.&quot;  How profound are those words after what we've seen in the last 4 or 5 weeks.  &quot;Love and Theft&quot; was released on September 11.  <br />In a time where there is no musical solid ground in an ocean of commercial and made for T.V. sound, Bob Dylan is an island. An Oasis in a desert of shifting musical sand.  He is thriving in a world that can produce no new icons in music.  <br />The musicianship is second to none. The lyrics are thought provoking.  At 60, Dylan's voice has aged, but is reasuring.  It echos the past and promises the future.   So give it a listen.  Take it allin.  It's a great collection of American music.
0393064476|5|There is nothing new under the sun, right? Move aside Einstein and the modern scientists:Democritus, Epicurus and Lucretius had already imagined the atom.<br />What would our modern world be without the re-discovery of the classical books?<br />That's how the Renaissance came about and lets be thankful for it.<br />I bought \\"The Swerve\\" because the proposition that the discovery in the 1400's of Lucretius' book \\"De Rerum Natura\\"  was one of the enlightning moments in the Renaissance interested me.<br />I was not disappointed.The Swerve is well researched and written and I would recommend it to anybody interested in the birth of Renaissance thinking, Italy and the ambience of the intellectuals of that time.<br />The philosophy part comes in the last chapters after an exhaustive description of the corruption of the Papacy and the Catholic priesthood. This part is very informative and interesting especially for those who know Italian history (and I am one of them) but I would have liked not to have gone through almost all the book before getting to Lucretius.
B00BUCXVPI|4|Nice thriller

B00F8L2VO4|5|I am tickled pink with this app.  I have tried various methods to learn another language in the past (books, tapes, cds, computer programs).  This one is so much easier to use, and I love the fact that my progress is saved online, so even if my phone crashes/dies, I don't lose my progress.<br /><br />I also like being able to use the app and the online version (everything is free!) together - my progress syncs.<br /><br />I am only at level 7 in Spanish right now, but I am loving the app - I encourage you to try it, too.
B008XG1X18|5|I love this app, it is very easy repinning, doing everything that the website does. I have had no problems on my Kindle Fire. I agree with others, this app works much better than other Pinterest apps.
B004ZNA5JO|4|If a group has created an album like Dark Side, and five is a high as a rating can be, then even a very good album like Momentary Lapse is consigned to four stars. The best off Pink Floyd had Roger Waters when he was still a member of the band (not &#34;the band&#34;), but Momentary Lapse proves they were coming back to life.
B00FAX6XQC|5|Good times
B00H1MDH3W|1|It refused to load onto my 7&#34; Android.  Getting djsappointedd in these app stores promises and claims.<br />Bad bad bad.
B0000028WD|1|No one besides McGuinn should ever be allowed to cover a Dylan tune!  Nobody else can capture the spirit of the song and do it justice.  No wonder Dylan was so uncomfortable at the end that he gave a lousy performance!!!

B0081SRJSY|3|Haven't really figured out how to succeed with this game.  Need an instruction segment to explain.
020530902X|5|I agree with several other reviewers here that the third edition is a little better than this new one. The 3rd is the last to be edited by E. B. White himself. The 4th has been \\"updated\\" with some new examples and advice, in a misguided attempt to remove nonexistent \\"sexist\\" language, which the anonymous new editor foolishly imagines has ruined previous editions. Most of the new examples, however, are inferior and some of the new advice too PC for my taste. (That wonderful passage from Jean Stafford's short story is gone, now replaced by an insipid contemporary piece that won't risk offending Irish alcoholics.)<br /><br />This is still a great book, overall, but I prefer the older version, so I will hang on to my tattered, trustworthy old copy of the 3rd edition. When it finally falls apart, I will look for another copy in a secondhand shop.
B0027MJU00|5|I listed to this on Audible during a 6 hour drive by myself. Having listened to it; I think I would prefer listening to the narrated story rather than reading it.<br /><br />This is told in a flashback to present and back fashion and told by several characters, very interesting and makes you keep wondering--- who killed Libby Day's family? What happened?  And why?  Why was Libby spared... did her brother do it, and for those that grew up in the 80s, the Devil Worship rumors totally make sense!!<br /><br />At times I felt bad for Libby, then others not so much when she decided she couldn't work, but rather lets take advantage of Lyle and the Kill Club... but the way the story is told, you're supposed to.. but then not!  Well written overall!!<br /><br />Whether you read it or listen to it, I highly recommend this story to anyone that reads mystery and suspense, because you have it all right there!<br /><br />I enjoyed it so much I just downloaded Gone Girl on Audible, makes those road trips and boring days just fly by while you clean house...
B004VMUS9G|5|Flexible and easy to use.  Irritates my wife when I leave behind she has to do the math,  especially after several snoozes.<br />];-&gt;
B0053YACVA|5|Again Mr. C . Makes another piece of cinematic history,  with V.M. at the wheel doing what he does best.  London,  Russian mob a curious death of a young lady a diary left behind with shocking details.  This falls into the hands of a nurse that wants answers.  & Just like a HISTORY OF VIOLENCE,  THE director is on the mark twisting & turning,  with a great sense of realism.  Also Vincent Cassell is in this movie a great actor that gives his 101%. If you have not seen in do so & believe you will add this steelbook to your collection!!!!
B00COMLLX2|3|Not bad, overall, but you can only play one of the many games, and you have to buy the rest.  Whatever.  The new Fire game controller is really hard on the hands for this game.  Those bottom protruding handles really get in the way when using the &#34;L&#34; and &#34;R&#34; buttons.
B003L77GG0|5|This series is the best series if you want to see how superman grew up and how the Justice League of America came about.  This series keeps all the movies, the comics and the series with George Reeves, in check.  The only complaint that I have with the series is that they bought Lois Lane in the series too soon.  Remember, Clark only got to know Lois when he left Smallville and went to Metropolis to work for the Daily Planet.  Other than that, that is the only complaint/negative complaint that I have with the show.  So sit back and enjoy the show and even this is the last season for the show, hopefully it will the best season ever and leave an opening for The New Adventures of Superman!!!  Who knows!  Enjoy the show.  Best of lick to this winning series.

B001HN6972|5|Based on the excellent novel by Bernhard Schlink, \\"The Reader\\" tells a story of Michael (David Kross), a 15-year-old boy growing up in postwar Germany who engages in a secret affair with 30-something-year-old Hanna (Kate Winslet). The relationship only lasts over the course of a summer, but it is extremely intense and affects both Michael and Hanna deeply. Although the couple enjoy the time they spend in bed together, their connection is strongest when Michael reads aloud to Hanna. Abruptly, the affair comes to an end when Hanna suddenly leaves town without a word of explanation. Their paths cross again years later, when Michael's law school class sits in on a high-profile trial for German guard crimes against Jewish prisoners. Shockingly, Hanna appears as one of the defendants in the case, and it is revealed that she is a former member of the S.S. Years later, a grown Michael (Ralph Fiennes) still finds himself haunted by the memory of Hanna, and he reestablishes a connection with her.<br /><br />This is a fantastic film that features an extraordinary cast. Kross and Fiennes both deliver outstanding performances, but Winslet is truly remarkable in this film, and she alone is worth sitting through the movie for. This is an excellent, excellent film.
B00FAPF5U0|5|I waste all evening on this game before bed. Enjoy the complex puzzles that sometimes take days to figure out
B003CSV7TK|5|This is definite annual viewing.  Stick with the original B&W version - you can't go wrong. Skip the recent remade, the original has everything you could possibly want.
B0093X805W|5|Great book! Excellent condition. Thank you!
B006VFLIYK|5|Great read, great suspense, great action, and possibly some heart and romance. I'll be interested to see where it all goes...
031606792X|5|Breaking Dawn delivered!  This series was compelling, fun, and a good read.  It is fiction, and personally, I like my stories to have the cliched \\"happily ever after.\\"  Isn't this what we were all hoping for from the beginning -- Bella and Edward forever?  As least that is what I was waiting for and Stepenie Meyer delivered!
B00DPM7TIG|5|excellent
B00L9B7IKE|5|i really enjoyed it .. quick reading for me .
0345803485|5|Shades of Grey trilogy was one of the best books ive read in a long time!  I couldnt put it down.  I ended up getting all 3 on my tablet this weekend and just finished! While some may disagree, I found it to be a wonderful defintion of unconditional love! Very erotic, sexual, and naughty, maybe even a bit taboo, but the storyline of a person's past and the reasons they are the way they are was wonderful to read! I give it 5 stars and highly recommmend!
B0071T5PN0|5|O refrão estranho de tattoo deixou todos apreensivos, no entanto, o &aacute;lbum supera os temores gerados em seu single, pois em todo o resto não se encontra nenhuma m&uacute;sica dispens&aacute;vel, &eacute; f&aacute;cil de ouvi-lo e at&eacute; cativante em v&aacute;rios momentos, Eddie est&aacute; s&oacute;brio e arrebatador nas 6 cordas mais uma vez e o show man Dave Lee Roth fez sua parte muito bem. &Oacute;timo disco para se ouvir no &uacute;ltimo volume com fones de ouvidos e perceber todos os detalhes desse super big rock!
B004SQS9FA|5|Radiohead is by far my favorite band.  That said, this album (in my opinion) is tied for 4th place:  1:  OK Computer, 2:  The Bends, 3:  In Rainbows, 4th:  Kid A and King of Limbs.  This album is perhaps one of the most experimental ones yet (other than Amnesiac and Kid A).  So, I've rated this album as an artistic tie with Kid A, and you're wondering why...  First of all, the album is really two in one.  The first four songs are a combination of Kid A and Amnesiac, while the second four songs are a combination of In Rainbows and awesomeness.  It's simply complicated music that makes so much since you can't deny the brilliant significance of its allure; if this album were a woman it would be among the most gorgeous you've ever seen.
0393312836|3|Part of the my 3 star rating is probably due to the lack of a character to identify with in this book.  I think that, for one, made the book much more difficult to truly get into.<br />Most obnoxious however is the slang language used by the teens of the book.  It was good idea as a device to help take the reader to another time and place, but let's get real...words like bezoomny, slooshy, and klootch may be taking it a bit too far.  I found them distracting.<br />On the positive side, the book does a great job of raising a potentially realistic social issue.
B006ON41FC|5|fun for a quick game between classes ;-p it takes a little while to get used to the flying controls. I would recommend this game.
B004WJRF6C|4|I was very PLEASANTLY SURPRISED at the sound quality of Macca's remaster here. Looks like the McCartney Archived Collection is getting a very good treatment at Abbey Road studios. If you liked this album, you'll be glad you bought it.
B000006CCG|5|was seeing them in concert back in the day.  Great CD from beginning to end.  Buy it now!  The torture never stops!!!
B006GWO5NE|5|It works well with my Kindle Fire and all my usb plug-ins.  The price was low enough and the shipping time was efficient.
B009NQKPUW|4|Classic Sci-fi Horror with an eye towards cosmological questions that challenge the common thinking of most people. This movie will make you think, if nothing else.
B0053JJLLC|1|I have been a Crichton fan from his first novel so it pains me to see his name used to promote a truely awful book. Nothing remotely believable in this one.  Had it been his first, it would have been his last.  A last ditch effort by all involved to cash in.  Shameful!
B00BHMETKC|5|Argo was a fast paced & suspenseful film.  Very interesting insight into this true-life drama from a pivotal point in history.
B00004RFFI|5|This movie must have gotten Storm Chasers a real boost.  Just as more and more videos of twisters appeared on nightly TV in the 90s this movie came out.<br />One thing this movie is though it is an great introduction, in a bit of a farcical way to the science of tornados.  This season of twisters has been very devastating and with so many storm chasers today, there are even what they call 'chaser jams' as the cars load the roads.  Unlike the competition in the movie for who will get the best view, there is a courtesy.<br />However, this movie has great special effects, the cow in the air scene was somewhat comical.  Touching was the scene of the destruction of a friends house, and horrifying was the scene just prior to it of a twister hitting a drive-in theater.<br />Hunt and Paxton work together well in this movie.  The attempt to outrun the category 5 at the end was a bit unreal, yet you are on the edge of your seat as the 1/2 a mile wide funnel gets ever closer.<br />I have purchased this movie as a gift for friends and have it on my want list for the future.
B00MIA0KGY|5|Excelent!!!!!!
B0047SKR54|5|A classic thought provoking film.  Something different to watch when you are tired of the typical comedy, romance or action movie.
B00N1HONIO|5|If Scott never made this game where would I but at. Me and my friends talk about it all the time. Thanks for making the game Scott I'll never forget the terror this game brought everybody to when they first play the game. This game will be always be the best. I LOVE THIS.
B001NEK2GE|5|I hesitated for weeks before buying this. I wanted to be relatively certain it was good item, as I don't like buying worthless do-dads. Let me state I LOVE this item. Your hand goes on 25 programmable keys that are thru-lit with any color you like. Each of those keys can be programmed for up to 3 different keystroke/macro combinations. The LCD display displays game and system stats. It fits your hand. It looks pretty.<br /><br />But, the primary thing that has improved my games is that little tiny thumb joystick. It takes over motion, and combines with the mouse (which you should already be using for your pointing and turning) and makes spinning and attacking or running an almost instinctive measure. I thought it would be hard to get used to, but I loaded in Serious Sam HD, and started off. Where before I was mindful of conserving ammo, now I almost always have a surplus, as I use the chainsaw to take out most mobs. A were-bull or skeletal cow comes at me, and I simply play El Matador and dodge and carve them as they pass by, continue my spin, and carve them from behind. nd i can afford to have the chainsaw out as it takes a tenth of a second to select any other weapon that might be claled for. I've got the keys programmed so my pinky sits on the 1 key, with number 4 being my forefinger. (Fitting, I suppose :) The next row of buttons down is 5-8. To select my rocket lancher, I move my pinky down a half inch and the chainsaw goes away, and the rocket launcher comes out. Sniper rifle? Middle finger drops half an inch. I can call forth every weapon in the game without moving my hand, without using the mouse scroll wheel, all the while I am still maneuvering using my thumb joystick and mouse. Jump? I raise my middle finger half an inch and jump. (I selected that spot because I am used to using that finger for the W key or forward motion, so it was not hard to re-learn.)<br /><br />I have set up these keys the way that works for me. If I want to taunt another player, myforefinger goes up one inch and pre-programmed taunt gets sent while I am still moving and firing. You could set them up in any manner you wanted.<br /><br />The programmable keys are sweet. The thumb joystick takes WASD and gives those motions all to my thumb. And, It is omni-directional--I can move my character in a full 360 degrees. That frees up the rest of the fingers on my left hand to be dedicated to weapon selection or any other duty I want.<br /><br />And, as much as the thru-lit keys are sweet, you will find you don't need them. Your hand fits on the ergonomically styled pad in one position, and you don't ever need to move it. You don't need to look at the keys, and you don't ever risk putting your fingers on the wrong keys after moving your hand to hit a number key or some other key.<br /><br />I am using it for Serious Sam, and Guild Was 2. If you like games more complex than solitaire, you will love this.
B0084B5TK8|2|fine
B002VHI8FE|5|If you are a fan of epic fantasy with a nasty edge you must read this novel!  This book really has no heroes but it has plenty of characters, flawed, evil, memorable characters.  I highly recommend it.

B008K8U13K|5|Plays great on kindle fire. Was going to get sonic Cd for 5 bucks but opted for this and I'm very glad I did. Graphics look amazing you have to get used to controls but that shouldn't take to long. Long time sonic fan, may still get sonic Cd but low app storage on kindle fire.
B004T2QZL8|3|Disappointingly fc'ing at only 62 elements into episode 1. I'd be quite irate if I had paid, but it's the FAOTD, so i can wait for an update. Otherwise, great gameplay, a/v outstanding, and exciingly, multiple episodes past what I've played online.<br />Audio: 4.5 / 5 (repetitive but not annoyinh sounds/music/voiceover)<br />Graphics : 4 / 5 - simple, yet elegant; animated combos, perhaps?<br />Premise: 4.5 / 5 - initial episode is straight classic; new eps: Santa?! :)<br />Replay: 3 / 5 - not something I'll lose interest in, but, if played without cheating may take so long to complete that replay is awhile off.<br />Length: 5/5 - Yeah. Don't cheat, and you're looking at hours of puzzling combos.<br />Bugs: 2/5 - stop-proceed FC's, as stated (again and again) by previous commenters. Multi-device; seems like a dev issue that'll hopefully be addressed shortly.<br />Age: 14+ - basic (actually, absurd) chem/bio combos, some adult-oriented quotes and elements, but potentially over the heads of younger crowds.<br />Overall: 3.75 / 5 - Essentialy, fix the bugs and I'm satisfied.<br /><br />Nigel the Pirate - Droid Razr Maxx.

B0058UXHHK|5|This book had me right from the start. I especially enjoyed it when she worked on her list. Will read more by Swank.
061891868X|4|the review, \\"unstrung\\" in \\"The New Yorker\\" (by Jim Holt, October 2, 2006) curiously concluded with some thoughts that had occurred independently to me. karl popper evidently \\"believed (that) there will prove to be no end to the succession of deeper and deeper theories.\\" the idea - basically repeated in the history of physics - had occurred to me that if string theory is ever completed, it will open our eyes so wide that eventually, we'll begin to notice problems with the theory itself, ultimately necessitating a \\"theory of everything we used to know, and then some.\\"     even if that turns out to be true, perhaps there will be only a finite \\"succession of deeper and deeper theories,\\" but at some point, \\"the next theory\\" simply may prove to be beyond even a group of 1000 newton, carnot, maxwell, lorentz, einstein, bohr, heisenberg, schrödinger, dirac, gell-mann, feynman, 't hooft, etc., clones: \\"Perhaps the most fundamental truth about nature is simply beyond the human intellect, the way that quantum mechanics is beyond the intellect of a dog.\\"     in george musser's book on string theory (a good \\"layman's\\" primer for this book), feynman was quoted as saying, \\"one thing that bothers me about physics, as it is understood today, is that an infinite number of logical operations, by any existing digital computer, would be required to understand what's going on in the tiniest bit of space.\\" turning that statement around, we should expect that this will not be the case with the \\"theory of everything\\" - it basically will be \\"computable.\\"     the final sentence of The New Yorker review bothers me, as feynman was bothered by the above:     \\"And, even if a final theory is found, it will leave the questions about nature that most concern us - how the brain gives rise to consciousness ... - untouched.\\"     during my freshman year, i developed a rather complete epistemology of my own, which is essentially positivistic. i was naive enough to think that nobody else had ever thoughtof that stuff before me (or perhaps i didn't even happen to wonder if anyone else had), but ultimately i concluded that consciousness is fundamentally beyond our understanding and explanation, because the only \\"tools\\" for understanding consciousness are the elements of consciousness, themselves. consequently, any \\"theory of consciousness\\" necessarily would be self-referential, and whatever logic that provided scaffolding for the theory, ultimately would be circular.     it seems to me that an honest-to-goodness \\"theory of everything\\" must also explain consciousness. however, if consciousness is fundamentally beyond human understanding, then so it would seem is this \\"ultimate theory of everything.\\"       for my part, overall, smolin wrote quite an interesting, informative, and thought provoking book. my impression is that the difference of opinion between him and joe polchinsky (as the \\"representative\\" of string theory) - that each tend to perceive the \\"opposing camp\\" of exaggerating their own successes, while having obvious biases against views they don't share - is a somewhat predictable consequence of each having a point of view that he strongly believes in ... and, of course, the fact that they strongly believe in differing points of view is basically due to the fact that they have differing judgments regarding physics, sociology, etc.     in \\"black holes & time warps,\\" thorne made a comment regarding the remarkable difference in the ways that 1st-order-approximation-similar people think, using himself & stephen hawking as an example. one of smolin's central theses, of course, is that given the complexity of present day theoretical physics, such differences in modes of thinking are, in fact, an indispensable resource.     polchinsky, presumably, doesn't fundamentally disagree, but simply believes that smolin overestimates the degree to which string theory's dominance limits the opportunities of those having very different ideas (as the early lack of respect forstring theory affected the opportunities of people like john schwartz, who ... after princeton put him out on the street ... likely spent 12 years as a research associate because feynman thought string theory was \\"crazy\\").     and presumably both would agree with the idea, and ideal, expressed by feynman: \\"Science is a way of trying not to fool yourself\\" ...     note the word, \\"trying\\" - if anyone had a crystal ball, he could easily avoid the possibility that the future may judge him a fool.       but that's too serious a way to end, following peter shor's review, above - without a doubt the funniest piece of \\"scientific humor\\" i've ever read! (obviously, i haven't spent the past quarter-century or so working on string theory.) however, he neglected to mention one key scam, as follows:     String theorists: \\"the theory you sold me yesterday was pregnant. it gave birth to 4 or 5 more theories, and they're spilling all over my neighbors' lawns!\\"     Nature: \\"no problemo! UPS just delivered a bunch of nice new dualities...\\"     String theorists: \\"what are those?\\"     Nature: \\"well, they're kind of like inverse fun-house mirrors. if you set them up in just the right way, you can make a whole bunch of theories look like just only one theory! if you hurry, your neighbors may not even notice that their lawns are covered in physics equations.\\"     String theorists: \\"ok, i'll take a set of dualities, too.\\"     Nature: \\"no problemo! and here's 5 more c-y manifolds, on the house!\\"       i guess we'll just have to wait for the einstein of the 21st century to come along & slash thru this great gordian knot ... maybe a \\"genetic marriage\\" of kip thone & stephen hawking (having 2 Y-chromosomes, and therefore really, really, super mathematical ability, and also lots & lots of facial & body hair) could pull it off.     did peter mention seers? i happen to be a seer, and i \\"see\\" that the final theory will be a quantum mechanical analogue of how to make bets with yourself, in such a way that in the long run, you come out a winner ... unfortunately, i'm not enough of a master craftsman to work out the details.
B00I8H6MGS|4|McConaughey does a great job. Story line a bit difficult - but it is reality!!
0307887448|5|I love this book. It's nerdy. It's quirky. It's a love letter to 70s and 80s pop culture, classic and modern gaming, and traditional sci-fi. I think the main character is a bit too emo and aloof, like we see in teen dramas, novels, and anime. While the main character is a teen, the massive references to the 70s and 80s encompass Kline's personal love for the era of his childhood and appeal to a similarly-aged audience, so I'm unable to relate to the main character. I also feel like the pacing is a little off. The first third of the book starts slow to set up the world, then gets a little faster when the first key and gate are found. Then, it slows down again during the second third of the story during the part where the second key and gate are found. But for the last third, it amps up to supersonic and so much happens so quickly. I feel like some of that energy could have been moved to the middle part of the story to keep it more even.  That said, I still love this book. It's one of my favorite novels. If you like old school video games, the 80s, pop culture, virtual reality worlds, damn the man themes, or coming of age stories, you'll probably love this book, too.
B0026OR1UK|4|Well told and documented. This a good read about the process of developing skill and talent. I recommend it to all parents.
B0000640VO|5|On top of the second review, Au-desla des mots! This film will be highly appreciated by those who share a close resemblance to any characters captured in Amelie.  If you're too ignorant to bother with subtitled foreign films that require some added attention and intelligence--maybe you should stick to Disney's, The Little Mermaid.

B00CNQ7HAU|5|John Grisham is back.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book all the way through.  A good story that moved at a comfortable pace.  Highly recommend.
B001FKKLNK|5|I am completely floored that there are only a couple reviews for this classic.  As the title of one of his earlier albums states...'Everybody Digs Bill Evans'  I can't even say it's an acquired taste.  Unlike single malt scotch, or dark chocolate, this hits you from square one.  From the moment I heard it, I was like, 'ahhh...that's it!!'  I don't claim to be a critic, but I've been blessed to recognize greatness.  It's as if these 3 souls merged briefly, then scattered, forever.  Bassist Scott LaFaro was killed in a car accident 10 days after these sets, but thankfully lightning has been caught in a bottle...trust me, this is up there with, 'Kind of Blue', 'Time Out', 'Birth of the Cool', or any of the other 'cool' or 'west coast' jazz greats.
B00IRMTTPU|5|This was a movie that met the goal of putting you in another person's place and experiencing what it would be like to have your freedom taken from you.  It does not have a lot of brutal &#34;special effects&#34;.

B0087ZG7PW|5|Hitchcock liked to film in California. Vertigo was filmed in the Mission District of San Francisco and at the Golden Gate bridge. Shadow of a Doubt, his favorite movie, was filmed in Santa Rosa, which is north of San Francisco on highway 101. The Birds was filmed at Bodega Bay, which is west of Santa Rosa on CA highway 1, the Pacific Coast highway. If you head north on highway 1,you can drive to the Canadian border at Vancouver. Head south and you will eventually reach Santa Cruz, Big Sur, LA, San Diego and Tijuana and Ensenada in Baja California on the Sea of Cortez.<br />I put on The Birds for my cat Monkey, but she preferred to watch the real birds sitting in the olive tree in my front yard from my bay window. After watching the birds, Monkey took a nap in the cardboard shipping box from Amazon that the DVDs came in.<br />Monkey does not know that birds are what is left of the dinosaurs. If a meteorite had not crashed into the Mexican state of Yucatan millions of years ago, Monkey and I would have made a nice meal for the giant dinosaurs, who were wiped out by the meteorite.
B009XPGJYY|5|If you like violence and mayhem this is for you.
B0000C03AH|1|This horrific offering is why SACD as a format is struggling. Instead of giving us more detail, they have smoothed everything over and given us symphonies so sweet sticky and gooey that they make your teeth hurt. Im sure that von Karajan would approve of what they have done (he seemed to love a homogeneous well blended sound), but it's killing me. I own this cycle on tape, vinyl, a version of the 9th on regular cd, and now this SACD version, and I'm telling you that they flushed all the detail down the toilet when they remastered it to this.<br /> I know that if they had just transferred what was on the masters and given it to us straight; the tape hiss would have been excessive (maybe even brutal), but at least we would have been able to hear the actual music as well.<br />If you like your Beethoven to be as smooth aged and mellow as the finest blended Scotch, then this box set is for you.<br />If you like your Beethoven to be raw real and ALIVE, then you need to invest in one of the cheap regular cd versions of this cylcle, or check out von Karajan's single malt 1950's Beethoven cycle (It's von Karajan conducting an Orchestra instead playing one like a virtuoso).<br /><br />Davis Hurd.

This is a good one!

B008602KQI|5|Good story line.  I enjoyed this movie.  Actress is a good actor.  Just like the book.  I would recommend this to my friends.
0439023513|3|I was very disappointed by this book. The first 2, in my opinion, we're sensational. I was expecting much more from this one. I didn't like the direction it took. From the very start Katniss seemed so disconnected and reckless. Much moreso than in the first 2 books, and almost to the point of frustration.         --- Possible Spoiler ---        The ending was far too sudden and very anti-climactic. It almost felt to me like it was just jumbled together at the very last minute in order to meet a deadline. I would have liked for things to go much slower and come in more detail. The relationships between Katniss and those closest to her seemed to disappear into the background, almost as if she no longer cared. I was going to give the book 2 stars, but decided on 3 only because of the way it ended (literally the last 2 pages).
B00FJTYDKK|5|We laughed none stop.  This is a great family movie that kept everyone entertained!  Even the hard to please movie watchers.
B008Y7N7JW|4|I thought the acting was great, and the whole concept very interesting artistically.<br />I hated the weird styles of the general population, but began to enjoy them after a bit.  The whole sacrificial premise was revolting, but hey,it works in mainstream religion.
B0017SWPXY|5|What a great book! I spent the first nice day of the year inside with this book and have zero regrets.

B00CO8D3G4|5|In Choose Yourself James Altucher makes an important observation on the ongoing decline and decay of the American business world—namely that a corporate career in America has lost its grandeur and luster, along with its status as the epitome of the American Dream. Times are changing and there’s no going back to the golden past.<br /><br />So what is one to do in this new age with its seemingly foreboding economic twilight? Altucher has an answer—an answer imbued with a strong and genuine optimism.<br /><br />This is a new age, the Choose Yourself Age, or Choose Yourself Era, as Altucher calls it. The idea presented in this concise and information-packed book appropriately titled, Choose Yourself, is for the individual to reinvent himself by merging art (creativity) and entrepreneurship, and in the process become an artist-entrepreneur. This is a beautiful, even poetic idea, but more importantly, it’s a realistic idea, even sobering. The alternative to such a vision could mean becoming an automaton, practically enslaved as a worker drone to the decaying corporate realm with its managerial hierarchy. The idea of becoming an artist-entrepreneur might be shocking to those who’ve never imagined a Choose Yourself Age, or a Choose Yourself reality. And it is shocking in some strange way.<br /><br />In Choose Yourself, is Altucher actually asking the reader to consider following big dreams, making a new reality, taking control of his destiny, and daring to fail in the process? The answer is yes!<br /><br />But the author does not appear to be suggesting a mentality where making money through entrepreneurship is the be-all end-all of being human. Rather, he stresses the importance of building a solid foundation of mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual elements. Having a foundation is key, and Altucher is not speaking from theory, but from experience. Here’s a man who achieved success through creativity, hard work, and by taking risks. And yet, the reader will also learn of the low times that Altucher experienced as an entrepreneur and a forward-looking businessman.<br /><br />One of the most fun and interesting ideas that the author shares in the book is the idea of flexing one’s idea muscle. “Make your brain sweat,” as Altucher says.<br /><br />The book deserves a stronger ending, a tight summation and review of the key insights Altucher presents. Otherwise, it’s a pleasure to read.<br /><br />Packed with wisdom, creatively written with a breezy and conversational style, Choose Yourself is ready to be chosen by the curious reader who wants more to life than what the current corporate doldrums offer. Choose Yourself is a must-read for any freethinker, artist, or contrarian.l also learn of the low times that Altucher experienced as an entrepreneur and a forward-looking businessman.<br /><br />One of the most fun and interesting ideas that the author shares in the book is the idea of flexing one’s idea muscle. “Make your brain sweat,” as Altucher says.<br /><br />The book deserves a stronger ending, a tight summation and review of the key insights Altucher presents.

6305171769|5|H20 is as good (if not better IMHO) than the original.  Laurie is no longer the scared teen we grew to love, she's got the gut's to put an end to a 20-year-old terror.<br />IMHO, the only &quot;flaw&quot; in the movie was  that Michael's mask should have been the one used in H6.
B00MUCX6AW|3|It is a 3.5
B00M4ADWTK|5|Love the movie and the extra's.
B00650SSDU|4|This is a romantic comedy for sure, but it is well deserving of its \\"R\\" rating.  It could be called a sexual comedy as these two are more interested in getting into bed rather than anything else.  Mila Kunis is cute and easy to watch, and Justin poses and postures for the camera. Once was enough for me and I will pass this CD on to someone else to watch.
B003TNQEF0|5|It was very disturbingand suspenseful
B000GOU4M4|5|Such a great film for Christmas time. Always good for a laugh
0385508417|4|Skipping Christmas can be divided into two parts. The first is spent building the anticipation of what a wonderful idea it would be to skip Christmas. All the insanity of the holiday season is exposed, making you feel tired just thinking about it, and relieved for the characters who are going to be able to avoid it. However, a plot element that was fairly easy to see coming occurs and derails their plans, which makes the second part of the book. Though predictable, this second part is quite funny. If you ever thought skipping Christmas might be a good idea, or if you just don't enjoy the holiday season, then this is a good read. If you love everything about the holidays, then skip the book. You wouldn't get it, anyway.
B00CLD65X0|5|I love this show I can hardly wait for the next season.
B006KP3XCQ|5|This dvd comes with the eco-friendly packaging for a very good price. Our was a little bit \\"flat\\", but the dvd has no any damage.

B000I55YV2|5|A really awesome movie, cast and screenplay, great acting.  Suspenseful and funny!  The only thing about the standard DVD is POOR video quality.  I wound up buying the Blu Ray version--much better.
B0000025JT|5|The late 70s was probably a time of artistic low for Barbra Streisand.  Sure, she was releasing hit song after hit song, and her movies were huge hits, but they were pretty much more about the money, and not the art.  That all changed when Guilty was released in 1980.  Not only did she have a huge success with a dying music trend, but she also recorded what is arguably her best album ever.    01.  \\"Guilty\\"- possibly the strongest track on the album, this is a mid-tempo number that not only has a fantastic rhythm, but a great chemistry between Barbra and Barry Gibb.  It gets an A    02.  \\"Woman In Love\\"- another mid-tempo number (though actually closer to slow), this was a huge hit for Barbra, and with her great phrasing and beautiful voice, it'll be easy to hear why.  A-    03.  \\"Run Wild\\"- a very pretty song, only added by the fact that is has a goosebump-inducing guitar rift between stanzas.  Pretty sexy too.  A-    04.  \\"Promises\\"- a great song to gear you up after the slow pace thus far.  A really fun track, especially if you want to dance.  A    05.  \\"The Love Inside\\"- a very sad, but very touching song.  Prime example of Barbra singing movingly without oversinging.  Not the greatest song, but pretty good.  B+    06.  \\"What Kind of Fool\\"- another duet with Barry Gibb.  Not as good as the title track, but still a good listen.  B+    07.  \\"Life Story\\"- a lovely mid-tempo track that finally has Barbra in a more feminist voice, than a weak I-need-a-man voice.  Very Nice.  A-    08.  \\"Never Give Up\\"- another fun fast song, which will have your foot tapping in no time.  Should have been released as a single, but what's done is done.  A    09.  \\"Make it Like a Memory\\"- perhaps the only song on here that I can say is just okay.  Not too memorable (no pun intended), a bit overlong, and the instrumentation is rather overblown.  But still, a powerful song, that isn't totally unmoving.  B-    An album that every fan will want, but even self-proclaimed haters of Barbra Streisand could probably find a few songs that are very enjoyable on here.  Aside from the Broadway Album, this is Barbra's best album.  And the 2005 sequel, Guilty Pleasures, is a great listen as well.
B00AOCLWF6|4|Action packed, great story, good plot. An excellent modern day sci fi series. It is great watching it on Amazon without commercials.
B004Q8LDL2|4|It's too campy and smart-ass for five stars, but the talent level is high and the 2d characters are played to the hilt. It's a popcorn, check your diploma at the door kind of movie, to be watched for fun, not for scientific achievement or emotional exercise, and on this level it succeeds, completely.

B00275EGWY|2|The Hurt Locker, 2008 film    The film starts in \\"Bagdad 2004\\". American soldiers arrive at a street. A robot machine inspects a pile of rags. Goats roam in the streets. A wheel falls off a cart, a soldier dresses in protective gear to inspect the bomb. A man fingers a cell phone, the bomb explodes. A package is sealed for shipping. We see another patrol on the streets to check for a reported bomb. A car goes past the troops, then stops. The soldier disarms the fuse on the bomb. But there are six more! They are disarmed. Some soldiers play video games. Peddlers sell DVDs. Later there is another car to inspect. A shot causes a fire. \\"He's not going to make it.\\" The truck is filled with 155mm shells. The wires are cut. He searches for the main fuse and cuts it. \\"873!\\"    There is talk with an advisor. There's more drama at an explosion site. They find four armed men with an SUV in the desert. There is an ambush! A sniper hits soldiers from a distance. Can they reach him? A jammed magazine is cleared. They wait to aim again. One soldier spots an insurgent crawling along the bridge by the goats. They later relax with rough humor. The specialist collects souvenirs. The conversation reveals their past lives. [Does loneliness cause drinking?] The Colonel goes for a ride. They search an abandoned building. They find a load of explosives and a dead body. \\"What is he doing?\\" A bomb hits the Colonel! Could a DVD merchant be a spy for the insurgents?    The specialist gets a ride to a house. Who was responsible for \\"Beckham\\"? He flees the house. James is summoned for a new mission. People flee from a \\"suicide bombing\\". Or was it a remote detonation? They search the alleys. A burst of gunfire is a warning. The soldier is rescued, but wounded. A man with bombs strapped to his body walks towards the American lines. Is it a trap? Can the harness be removed in time? \\"I hate this place.\\" The year is over. Back home he visits a supermarket. Is this what he was fighting for? \\"The olderyou get the fewer things you really love.\\" [Is that true?] Will he return for another tour of duty?    This film is a pseudo-documentary with little drama in it. Does it have a lesson? Was it designed to straddle the line between pro-war and anti-war so an audience could read their own feelings into it? \\"War is a drug\\" is just nonsense. Wars are fought to exploit property and people. Whenever you read about conflict over some barren desert you can be sure there is mineral wealth involved. Those who are involved in combat (or other sports) can get an adrenaline high, but that is hardly a \\"drug\\".

B0048KXRR6|5|I loved the first one and the second one is every bit as good.  It's a children's movie I guess but I am entertained, I laugh and I cry.  The acting is terrific, the scenery is lovely, and Emma Thompson is an amazing woman with so much talent I wish there was a way to bottle her.

B008WCP2PG|3|\\"Magic Mike\\" is directed by Steven Soderbergh, one of the most critically acclaimed directors in recent years. The film deals with the world of male stripping, with a story that is, it is reported, loosely based on the life of the star Channing Tatum. This is interesting, I thought, and yes, the dancing part is pretty impressive, but the rest of the film seems too slow-paced and low-keyed for me to be really interested, except the comic relief from over-the-top Matthew McConaughey.<br /><br />The story is about \\"Magic Mike,\\" a dancer (played by effective Channing Tatum) at Xquisite Strip Club in Tampa, dreaming of becoming a furniture designer. Mike befriends and takes aimless Adam (Alex Pettyfer) under his wing, and as it turns out, Adam, or The Kid, quickly gets accustomed to the new lifestyle. In the meanwhile, Mike gets acquainted with Adam's concerned sister Brooke (Cody Horn).<br /><br />There is a stark contrast between the ways in which the dancers' on-stage routine and off-stage life are described. One is full of loud music and well-choreographed dancing, while the other is quiet, drab and dull. I would even say too dull, because despite the interesting character of Mike and the realistic descriptions of the backstage, most characters are just cyphers. We are never allowed to know these dancers, and as to the main story of Mike, Adam and Brooke, well, I think I have seen it somewhere before.<br /><br />\\"Magic Mike\\" is a missed opportunity, a film that could have been much emotionally involving with someone other than Soderbergh as director, who tends to be too self-conscious. I think I know his style, and I respect that. The film is sensitively and intelligently directed, but I think a little bit of more emotion would be welcome sometimes.
B00881VLCE|5|This app allows puzzle lovers to always have a jigsaw puzzle at your fingertips!!<br />Fun, convenient and challenging!<br />The best part is you can even pick up where you left off
B0000CDLA7|5|Maybe I'm biased (I've been a Dream Theater fanatic since &quot;Images And Words&quot;), but this is their best album yet. I recommend this CD to anyone who loves progressive metal. It has all the elements - crunchy guitar riffs and blistering solos from Petrucci, excellent keyboard and bass work from Rudess and Myung, awesome drum patterns and fills from Portnoy, and great vocals from LaBrie. It's heavy (very heavy), melodic, and progressive. What more could you ask for if you're a prog metal fan? If I had to compare it to other DT releases, I would have to say that it is more along the lines of &quot;Awake&quot; than anything else, which, in my opinion, is a good thing. If you like straight-ahead rock that you hear on the radio, you probably won't like this album. But if radio rock bores you (like it does me)and you like ten minute songs that are all over the place with with a strong emphasis on musical virtuosity, then you should love &quot;Train Of Thought&quot;. I can't get enough of it.
B00900NAFI|5|Great.

B00FWPWNKS|4|Pretty mindless, but very addicting.  There are several levels with dozens of games on each level so it's a lot of playing time.

B00026KDC2|4|The moment i heard Hey You i bought the cass back then and loved it ! Hey You is one simply but great song that i played over and over till i wore it out ! The rest of the album is good and fun to listen to ! Other reviews have them in the mould of the Black Crows but i say they are a cross between Motley Crue and Cinderella ! They make music fun and dont try to make it thought provoking !

B00000K19E|5|Anyone not loveing this movie is not a true scifi fan at all.  This the kind of action I have been waiting for since the Bruce Lee movies.  The special effects will send you out of this world.  The story line is right  on time!  It is the best action movie of the 1990's!  Also it is a new plan  of film making, the way the brought animation to real life!  You have to  add this movie to action collection!

B00GZ6L48U|5|May as well call it the Chris Potter band. Pat and the rest are of course spectacular. Perhaps I have developed a tolerance for Pat and Antonio's usual brilliance? But Chris Potter's sax stands out the most on Kin.<br /><br />No more so than on track 2 &#34;Rise Up&#34;. Not only does Chris's solo anchor one of the strongest tunes on Kin, but it is one of the finest I have ever heard, on any instrument, from any style or era of Jazz, or from any other genre of music. It always takes my breath away.<br /><br />Pat Metheny described the inspiration for &#34;Rise up&#34; as one where all band members could play guitar together. As it turns out, it became a great jam track, with Unity Group members taking long solos. That about sums up Kin. Improvisational, structured around Pat's musical consciousness.<br /><br />In summary, Kin is yet another brilliant effort from Pat. One in which he put the role of band leader and producer first as opposed to soloist and composer.<br /><br />Yes PMG fans. I know Lyle is missing. But this simply is not PMG. It is something new and equally as enjoyable. So do please enjoy it.

0312330537|1|Ok this may turn out to be a really gripping book, God knows the Da Vinci Code was rubbish but i happily blazed through it whilst sat on a beach. This novel may similarly turn out to be full of twists and turns and highs and lows but im not sure if i will ever get to them. I have reached page 200 and have had to stop as i cant take the ridiculous cliche ridden pseudo-philosophy that accompanies every single; conversation, street, hotel room, chance meeting, journey, meal, conversation etc etc. Around 70% of every page is a dense thicket of vomitous gibberish.  A damned good editor is required here. My wife reads books like this in a few hours as she has a habit of skipping massive sections of each page and just taking in what's happening. Unfortunately I can't read like that. So im going to give this to my wife and then ask her for a summary when she is finished.  This must be a very good story considering all of the positive reviews, but it is some of the poorest writing i have come across for a long time. Disappointed.
B000003JBM|4|Any hardcore fan of Gang Starr should consider this essential. If not, then any fan of laid back hip hop will find this a nice find. Sure it isn't Premo but Guru definitely keeps the Gang Starr attitude kickin' on this smooth release. Just beware, this is certainly an album relegated for the bedroom or living room with a little cheeba use and not in your fly whip. It's very laid back but then again so was Gang Starr, right? If your favorite Gang Starr song is Discipline or Moment of Truth then you're good to go.
B00FR0GT9Y|2|As a Lifelong BOSTON fan I have to agree with the majority here...this release was a major disappointment. When I first heard the title of it, I felt uneasy. But, being BOSTON I had to give it a try. The only positive thing I can say is how good it is to hear our old friend Brad Delp again. He Is missed very much. If you can avoid this purchase, do so!  I will give them another chance if a future release is done but I will do it with more scrutiny. Tom CAN do much better, that's a fact!
B00IKZX1ZI|4|It is a good game but it would be nice if some of the levels were not so hard because the things you need to accomplish don't happen during the game.
B0036S4B6M|4|This book does a good job at connecting actions with outcomes. Something today's society tends little to think about. We are shown how Piper aged in life and maturity and comes to know how our lives are interconnected to people in ways that we wouldn't imagine.
B00J5A1MEY|5|So close to the book.  Love this one.
B00ESY7QXI|5|I've heard others say that the over the top CGI makes the movie seem unrealistic and hard to watch, but I think it emphasizes the theme of dreaming and Gatsby's dream of his perfect life with Daisy. Luhrmann does a quality job of embodying the spirit of Fitzgerald's novel without seeming like he copied the text word for word -- when there are direct quotes, it is a special perk for those viewers who know and love the original material.<br /><br />Luhrmann's choice of music and score is unconventional but impressive. Even with multiple diverse genres on the soundtrack, the album is centered around the themes of Gatsby and so the collection of songs somehow works and flows together. The only drawback of the stellar soundtrack is that, having listened many times to the songs, the lyrics became a distraction while they were played in the background of the movie itself.<br /><br />Leo and Carey Mulligan (and the rest of the cast, for that matter) brought their A-game for this movie. All of them succeeded at making me hate every character plus have a strange sadness towards Gatsby - key emotions that Fitzgerald seemed to desire for his readers to have after finishing the book.<br /><br />All in all, a fun and exciting rendition that gives life and and breath to its namesake.
B00GK643W4|2|My kid thought it was just ok. Not what they had expected. A bit too cheezy, but loved the books.
B003EY7IRC|5|All of her colorful characters from her other books make a cameo.  The reader is taken on a roller coaster ride right along with Mac, and it is a good one.  Karen Moning ties up the series nicely with a big red bow for the readers, but still leaves you wanting more.  She just gets better with each book.

B0094AH3MU|4|Based on a work by Friedrich Schiller and composed just after his first attempt at adapting Shakespeare to the opera stage in Macbeth, I Masnadieri was another attempt by Verdi to put some literary weight behind his work. The work failed however to live up to its source and was not a success when it was first performed in London in 1847 with Verdi himself conducting. More conventionally structured than Macbeth, I Masnadieri is not the greatest Verdi by a long stretch and hasn't enjoyed the same popularity as its predecessor, but it's still Verdi all the same and with the right kind of production, even the composer's lesser works can be highly charged and thoroughly entertaining. That's certainly the case with this 2012 production of from the Teatro San Carlo in Naples.<br /><br />It's true however that the work is initially constrained by its conventional structure. Each of the principal characters are introduced in the First Act with cavatinas that express their nature and their ambitions. The stagy conventionality of this introduction is matched by the apportioning of the roles according to type - the hero inevitably is a tenor, the love interest is a soprano, the villain is a baritone and the father is a bass. No surprises there. Having introduced the characters however, Verdi launches into the highly charged drama of the situation with his usual fiery arrangements which, if it has the right kind of treatment, can nonetheless be highly effective. The secret to making such material work of course - as is the case with all Verdi's early melodramas - is in the commitment and delivery of the performances.<br /><br />A production of I Masnadieri stands or falls based on the performers, more so than the staging, but thankfully, the Naples production is strong in both areas. The orchestra playing needs to be both sensitive and dramatic, and you only need to listen to the solo cello playing in the overture to see Verdi's intentions as well as gain some measure of how well that is achieved here. The singing performances are not quite perfect but impressive in the context of the live performance, which is where this kind of work comes to life. Much rests on the situation of Carlo and Amalia in this respect and both roles are well catered for by Aquiles Machado and Lucrecia Garcia, but there are no real weaknesses here either in Giacomo Prestia's Massimiliano and Artur Rucinski's Francesco.<br /><br />The staging is also supportive of the tone adopted for the work. It's a non-period specific setting, but none of it changes the essential character of the work. Carlo and his bandits are dressed like \\"dandy highwaymen\\" in long black leather coats and scarves, more likely to be riding bikes than horses. Set designer Alessandro Camera's wasteland setting has the motto 'Libertà o Morte' (Freedom or Death) emblazoned with a skull as graffiti on the backing wall. Francesco's entourage look like party goths, and threats are made with drawn pistols rather than swords, but everything fits perfectly with the mood and the dark intent of the piece and its insistence on drama above all else. Performance comes together well then with the score and the setting to make this an excellent account of I Masnadieri.<br /><br />The production comes across well on Blu-ray, although there appears to be some minor image flicker in places. Audio tracks are PCM Stereo and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 and the sound is vibrant and clear. As a part of the Tutto Verdi collection, the extra features contain the usual 10 minute Introduction places the work in the context of Verdi's career and gives an illustrated synopsis of the plot and characters. The disc is region-free, with subtitles in Italian, English, German, French, Spanish, Chinese, Korean and Japanese.
B005USZYDU|5|This book got my interest from the very begining and kept me guessing through out.  Will look forward to more of Theo.
B00COGZ8FU|1|Reading the reviews I was hoping for a fun action packed movie.  But, I expected it to be not so great.  Let me count the ways...<br /><br />1)  Tom Cruise is not Jack Reacher.  Has he read a description from the book?<br />2)  I am going to give Ms. Pike the benefit of doubt and say the writing for her character was a mix between \\"boobs, damsel in distress and deer in the headlights\\".  Her part was pretty awful, delivered in a wooden and non-believing way.  Like, \\"I can't believe these are my lines...really?\\"<br />3)  Cruise as three character faces and they all look about the same now days except for the level of jaw clinch.  I liked him better when he smiled and joked a bit.<br /><br />Not a good script, painful to watch, I found myself blushing throughout in embarrassment for the actors.
6303908306|5|I watched this movie for the first time one friday night in 1996.. and then promptly watched it a second, and then third time.  It is simply unvelievable.  The movie has a complexity the likes of which I have NEVER  run across, but of course, you won't know this until the end...
B004N7WJF0|1|VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE DVD HORRIBLE RECORDING
B00IX9UTLU|5|This was an awesome trilogy cannot wait for Hudson to be out in July....Liked it better than 50 shades, hope they end up having babies!!!
B000002GWJ|5|I bought this album on the recommendation of a friend. At first, I thought he was tweaking my nose...Tom Waits singing Bernstein/Sondheim's<br />&#34;There's a Place for Us&#34;?  However the first time I listened to the song, I realized that Wait's interpretation was far more touching than the glossy Broadway or movie soundtrack - in fact, it is genuinely moving. Even better, the rest of the album is wonderful, too. Waits is a masterful balladeer and  musician - and I'm sure most people write him off, the second he belts out his first gravelly note.  Their loss!  The more I've listened to his work over the years, i'm amazed at how, with a a few words and a few well placed notes, accented with the odd drumbeat or roll, can transform the ordinary, overlooked aspects of life into a musical Van Gogh technicolor masterpiece. Every time I play one of Waits' albums, I discover something new -- so they never become boring!  So, like all my other Tom Wait's albums, I'm sure I'll need to buy another copy, because I keep wearing them out. Tom Waits is one for the ages.
0062290797|5|Outstanding.....
B001UGIRF8|5|Got it the other day, and I just love this one! Had all the LP's in the 70's, but that's a long time ago... Bought a new Rega P3-24 turntable a few weeks ago, and this combination: New turntable + This set + My ears... it's an Absolute Unbeatable Threesome these days!
B00EKHE1JA|5|Purchased this twice and both times it came broken. Arm was broken off and not able to be glued. very disappointed. very overpriced.  same your money
B007SYWFRM|5|I was on level 32 when I accidentally sent it to the cloud along with another game. The other game came back to my Kindle Fire where I left off. Imagine my surprise when I loaded Ice Age and I was back to the beginning.  I had 23 friends from all over the world.  Now it is all gone. To say I am upset is putting it mildly. So just be careful or you could lose everything.
B005DOKL3E|5|It is handy and fits well.
B0027MJU00|3|An ok read.
B00FEMJF6O|5|This game is definitely a great way to pass the time. Fun quests and guests keeps the game going at a steady pace.
B00MO21WAY|5|What can we say?  Masterpiece is wonderful every season!  This season 5 is no exception.  Thoroughly enjoyable and look forward to watching it again.  We love these wonderful British actors.  They are top notch, take their acting craft very seriously, and deliver the best every time.
0060977493|5|\\"May in Ayemenem is a hot, brooding month,\\" and so is Arundhati Roy's novel The God of Small Things. Imagine a cold piece of butter slowly melting in a frying pan, setting the scene for the cooking to come, and you  can see the way Roy's prose works. Words that are hot and brooding reel you  into an intricate web of family politics and social mores, evoking a  feeling similar to a written stream of consciencness.   Roy writes in  layers, except that the layers are both added and taken off; I was reminded  of my childhood when I would eat wafer chocolates from the bottom and the  top, leaving the middle until last, because that was the best part. Roy  kindly dispells the, often torturous, anxiety of what happens in the end  early on in the book. The reader is told what happened before it happened,  what happened after it happened, and saves what happened for last. A format  that seemingly would put off a reader becomes its most appreciated quality.   This book is for everyone; murder mystery, love story, epic saga all in  one. Even if you're not the romantic type, the social scrutiny of Indian  customs provides for interesting reading. However, if you're interested in  brain candy, forget it. There is too much to absorb. Emotion and intellect  are needed in order to understand the emotion and intellect that are  related. You could take in only what is superficially presented, as the  plot alone is worthwhile, but you would be missing so much.  Rahel, a  dizygotic twin returns to the place of her childhood and subesequently a  place of unhappiness to see her brother, the other twin, after more than  twenty years of separation. Esta, the brother, has stopped talking, and  Rahel has stopped feeling. Their reunion allows for the remembrance and  grieving of their disasterous youths. They recall small things, seemingly  unimportant, yet vital to the reconstruction of their sense of inner peace.    They are the same age as their mother when she died, thirty-one.  Their house is run down and the only relatives left from the monster in  their pasts are, in essence, only waiting to die. Entering their minds  through an omniscient voice, we are transported back and forth in time,  remembering small things, painting a big picture. We remember a cousin's  accidental death, and the death of another who served as a scapegoat. We  remember how fate can make the strangest families. We also remember Rahel  and Esta, and how they \\"broke the love laws. That lay down who should be  loved. And how. And how much.\\"  While the novel serves to shock the  reader from time to time, the pace is slow. Roy's style would be described  as somewhat verbose for the impatient, yet serves to parallel the way we  deal with emotions, hurt, and love in life.  Creating a paradox however,  this reader went back to re-absorb certain elements of beauty or truth, due  to a lack of time created by an impatience to find out what happens next.   Although usually overly critical of fiction, I would recommend this book  for anyone who likes to read intelligent literature. It gives the reader a  chance to realize how profound those small things really are.
