B00J4PHFKU|5|Easy stock replacement
B003WJXADA|5|Thanks for the article came in good condition.<br />Sorry for the delay in responding
B00JG8H8QQ|5|simple, minimalist design with ultra thin padding turns out to be quite comfortable.  I have Giordana Targa pull-ons with slightly thicker padding that are not quite as comfortable.
B00JSJMV38|3|I measured my steering wheel and bought the appropriate one, but it is still about an inch bigger than my will and kinda hangs low off the bottom of the steering wheel.  Not enough to be able to see daylight, but enough that when you grab it to turn the wheel it mushes down and causes another part of the wheel cover to pop up a little bit.
B00G5RTYYK|5|WOW....these bad boys &#34;POP&#34; just like the photo displayed. Took a little longer than expected to install but totally worth it.
B000778LCA|5|Look fantastic on our 1975 Silver Streak.
B007N3P9DA|4|Work great so far.
B0081S5IP0|1|the plastic is of poor quality...i hung it on my rearview mirror, went shoping for an hour,came back and it was all wrinkled and out of shape
B008I7R6U4|4|It looks very good and it was very simple to replace.
B004ZF3A94|5|I bought the 10000k kit for my 2009 Honda Civic. This conversion kit is outstanding! Very easy to install. I did not have to call tech support for help as the installation manual is very informative. Puts out a beautiful bright  ice blue beam which is exactly what I was looking for. A month after I installed the kit, one of the ballasts went bad. I emailed customer service through Amazon and they sent out a replacement the very same day. Got it installed and all is well again. I cannot speak highly enough for their customer service! Quick to respond and extremely nice and helpful! I will definitely order more Kensun products in the future and I highly recommend this kit!
B007RVR4FE|5|just what I needed
B004304C0W|3|Great colors. Perfect for use in the shade, but it did get hot to the touch when used in the sun.
B0006IX896|5|Met all expectations.
B00A82A2ZS|5|for grandson for his 4 wheeler truck ~ price was great!!!
B00PSRORH2|4|I like the product but too small doesn't Keneally the sun away
B00KTIYXLU|5|ordered for the business ~ prices can't be beat! THanks!
B0045VHWUG|5|These are still on my first aid kit box after several years of abuse ad backcountry use.
B004AIHBR8|5|Had a CEL, did some research, found out the purge valve might be the culprit.  I have a 2008 Mazdaspeed 3.  Replaced this in about 10 minutes, and the CEL has been gone since.  Put about 1,000 miles on it since the replacement.
B003SYDF1G|5|Fit perfect!
B000S2SKIY|5|Exactly as described at a fraction of the cost from the dealership! Thanks! I will be back!
B004I0HFQK|5|Fit perfect!
B00MLQFFAQ|5|Replaced the oem lugnuts on my jeep cherokee. Solid chrome plated steel as opposed to stainless cap over steel lugnut. Will buy these again for my wife's liberty.
B0042ZIT7U|5|It looks great. Comes in handy at every campsite.
B00HZBSQL2|5|It was OK
B008R95GA0|4|good fit
B009K4H42Y|5|Perfect!  exactly as described, and shipped quickly, arrived safely, and as expected.  (Yes, these ARE -A01)
B001GRTFL6|5|anyone who lives in the northeast should have these to protect their car.  Enough said!
B00LGDOR0Y|3|didn't thread down all the way
B00192JFBI|5|Works great
B00KXENX8E|1|Don't order this unless you know what you're doing, or have someone who does install it.
B006IVC9I6|5|Perfect fit on my 1999 Jeep Cherokee sport 4.0L XJ.  Can be installed with a loaner spring compressor from Advance Auto... or another parts store that loans tools.
B001B7VSPW|5|Excellent fits great on my 08 F150
B008G3KG70|5|Happy with the quality and fast shipping.
B00GURJZI0|5|Changed the all around performance of my gy6, awesome buy I would recommend this to anyone
B00TXENKTM|5|I love it! The colors are beautiful and I am so excited to apply it to my car. My only complaint is that it is much smaller than I expected- it's only about the size of the palm of my hand. Still, the sticker is beautiful AND the package included an extra surprise sticker as a gift. I'm very happy :)
B012GLNJXA|5|I've been riding and racing sport motorcycles since 2008 and have used all of the leading manufacture's stands but this is my first Moto-D stand or product. The build quality is high with a very good fit and finish. It looks to be able to take plenty of abuse over many years and will look good doing so.  Highly recommend product and I intend to look to Moto-D for future needs.
B002P8QSAG|4|Easy install. Fit great
B000BUQOG8|4|Works like it is supposed to.
B003S8KS80|5|tks
B000ARTZPE|1|When I read the reviews about it, I thought this is the one. Unfortunately, after pouring into tank , I did not feel any difference or whatsoever. Disappointed-(
B0040CYWX0|5|They work good as stock!
B00YRXAQKU|4|good part
B00BPABJI6|5|The part is perfect, thanks Amazon
B00DSD5N5I|5|Excellent product!
B008427D88|5|Bought some 10mm fasteners previously, but they do not fit in many places. These 8mm ones on the other hand fit great everywhere plastic clips are used on my Hondas. I always break them when I pull them out, so having a ton on hand is great to keep from being that guy who's plastic covers drag on everything.
B008KVFH18|5|I got this airtex fuel pump from Amazon was very good deal and the product was great so far I had no problem thank you Amazon .com
B00684TIVE|5|Very good works great you should replace batteries with quality batteries though
B0009IQY1C|5|Good
B00AE4U6T2|5|Great gift for my husband.  He can find his keys fast now!
B0037IYLYI|5|It is great!!
B00OSZ2N08|5|The size it perfect. Material is great. Really good product.
B00JK9FTLC|5|Product was as described and arrived on time, it is very heavy duty.
B00CFQVFMY|5|Perfect fit.
B00NQ8FD4G|4|Great product for the price!  The wire and insulation is very pliable and easy to pull.  The only downside is the insulation is on the thick side, making pulling a lot of wire through the aluminum tubing wakeboard tower somewhat challenging.
B008YDD6J2|5|great fit.
B007O3KZAQ|5|works great
B00B9H3WDK|5|Thank you replacing this switch.  I put it in tonight and it worked great . Thanks dave c.
B00BYQDHPY|4|Very functional.  The only problem is the idiots who shipped it puta sticky bar code right on the window of the GPS holder and screwed it up.  Otherwise it's a great bag.  oh the backpack straps are a bit short and flimsy for a full size adult.
B0055SYJ8Q|5|Came rolled, but once I put it in the car it fit like a glove.
B000AO5L0U|3|Love this tool design for an ultra-minimalist bicycle &#34;multi-tool&#34;, however the steel is low quality and the ends wear out much more quickly better quality tools.
B0001EXGZG|5|Perfect Excelent Quality F250 2001 5.4L
B00KL3ALGO|5|Great for my SUV!
B000BUTD8Y|4|Easy to assemble and install.  Good protection against elements especially protecting gas rubber lines and regulator.
B00BDO48XM|5|Use the Polymer Net Shield on my wheels. It made a big difference and I barely have to clean my wheels that often anymore.<br /><br />It put a hint of gloss to my semi gloss black wheels which I love! Will definitely purchase this again<br /><br />Will try it on my car this weekend
B00FJVAHG2|5|Rt SIze 66&#34; inches for the door and half F250 2001 5.4L XLT Super Cab 1.5 doors on each side. Excelent Quality. I need the help of my 18 year son to install. Instalation is completly easy if you can elevate your vehicle at leat 12 inches from floor for space to work.
B004I0FE7C|5|Fit perfectly on my 01 Tacoma. Looks good. Took 1 minute to install.
B0131S1YV6|1|Worst led ever, not bright at all, claims 11 watts but no where near that, seller claims is total combined, so is actually 5.5 watts, I have 5watt led's but are brands name and are still brighter that this ones, seller still thinking about my refund, worst buy ever.
B00KTHZJ1O|5|Just what I needed...Took it to a Locksmith to get it cut and programmed for $49.95 ....Works perfect and a lot CHEAPER then going thru the Car Dealer at $250? I would order it all over again if I had too!!!!
B00RILMM0A|3|it worked
B0073W1EX0|5|Great product!!!!
B00SGH8QHI|5|I mounted it under my front bumper/spoiler because it's very low and I kept running up over parking curbs.  Turn it on and off with a remote 12V relay switch on my keychain-  if you leave it on all the time, it will beep erratically and intermittently.  But so far, it's great-  starts beeping when I'm about 12-18 inches away from the curb and becomes a steady tone at about 6-8 inches.  The actual beeping unit is mounted under the hood near the windshield, but it's so loud I have not problem hearing it (in fact, if it was inside I think it would be too piercing).  Definitely worth the very modest price.
B001EP2922|5|perfect fit.
B008VPW5LS|3|Sure wish it included some sort of instructions. This might be all you need, should you ever figure it out.
B000CPCO9S|5|Worked like a charm.  I made the mistake of tightening them up to tight and shared the head off of the bleeder. Totally my fault.
B00363M0TC|4|It works great, but don't let the can and straw let you think that you should be blowing or spraying this into your printer. The product needs to be carefully applied to rubber rollers. If you can remove the rollers and soak them with the product, that would be best. Otherwise, carefully apply to rubber rollers. Product will run and drip, so use something to catch the run off. Do not put the rollers back until they are dry, and wipe off any remaining residue with a dry cloth. I don't know if it will hard plastic, but it will discolor it.<br />Do a test print to detect residue, and continue to print until residue does not show up on printed paper.
B0042OX8YA|5|The dealer wanted over $70 for this part, it fixed my Daytime driving lights, wasn't the easiest part to replace because of the location but the dealer wanted $100 to do the labor, only took 10 minutes to replace once I figured out how.
B000C1Q68M|5|These are the correct replacement for many Hondas. Check to be sure yours fits, but it fits our 2002 Honda Accord and our housemate's 2010 Civic.<br /><br />I always used to put Bendix semi-metallic on my cars, but ceramic has come a long way. The metallic brakes will wear out your rotors, but the ceramic brakes are more gentle and will allow you to use the same rotors longer, saving you money. The formulation gives terrific stopping distance, so you don't sacrifice performance for economy. I was skeptical at first since I liked metallic, but I like these Akebono ceramic brakes better.
B00J972V84|2|The quality of the shift nap was good the only thing is the diameter is too big needs to be smaller if it was smaller I order another
B00Q3367W8|5|Excellent
B0038B7GS2|5|Makes my Toyota stand out. Nice bright blinkers also.
B000C5CESO|3|it,s not red. it is regular black
B002R1P93I|5|Excellent  light assembly  works  perfectly.  Should have purchased two instead of one.
B00PYCXMUE|5|Extremely pleased with Mcguires 6' AND their 3&#34; Cutting AND Buffing Pads.  Made in the U.S.A., Cut extremely well and last, last and last!<br />I will stop buying others pads and remain loyal to Mcguiar's Pads- no need for me to spend wasted time looking for the best pad at a reasonable price because I just found it.
B000BXOFV6|5|Excellent product and no mess.
B007C800XU|4|Awesome!
B0002I94CK|5|Needed item, great transaction
B008S826Z8|5|Very useful.
B00108CKI6|5|Great product for great price!!!! Cost a LOT more at my auto parts store!! Thanks again Amazon, you keep coming through!!!
B00UHVUYYO|5|got this unit for my 40th birthday a few weeks ago to go on my 2013 RZR XP 900.<br />LOVE IT! the speakers are just the right size (used to have a pair of 6.5's that were just too big) and the sounds coming out of these bad boys is just awesome. did took a moment to figure out the speaker's mounting pad  instructions but ended with perfect fit.<br />the amplifier has a room for an extra pair of speakers, so that's a nice option to have.<br />cool remote. no need for head unit of any sort so saved a buck or two there. the BT works great.
B00JDPSRM6|5|Husband loves these, great quality and fit!
B009OA37S4|2|When I evaluated which cabin air filter to purchase, I eventually purchased I THOUGHT the name IMPLIED the filter would 1) trap particles, 2) contain odors and 3) perhaps also make my cabin smell better.  While it MAY perform functions #1 & #2, it certainly doesn't do #3.  That's simply &#34;marketing&#34; at work -- which bumped up the price from other similar filters that all offer to trap particles and thereby contain odors.  Had I not bought into the slick branding, I would have saved about $8-10.  Dummy me.  I WOULD compliment them for including a video that showed how to change out the cabin air filter for my specific vehicle.
B007P05FBW|1|Nutsert and ball joint that screws into nutsert will rip out of newer Ford tailgates due to mounting hole in tailgate being elongated. Tried two of these and both failed. Even when functioning it just barely managed to slow the tailgate drop on my 2016 F250.
B001CIEIYI|5|This thing is amazing.  It does exactly what K&N filters advertise they say they do.  Read my review on the Superchips 1855 Flashpaq.  Get this cold air intake and filter now before it's to late.
B00GMTWFJ2|5|Great smell!! Product will last awhile
B00RBWQH4I|5|The fan in our RV bathroom was about useless. A noisy 6&#34; fan blade with no shroud and an even more noisy roof lift cover. Although this fan blade is also 6&#34; wide, it is effectively shrouded, much quieter, and I no longer need to lift the cover to get great air circulation so the bathroom is much cooler on hot days. It is much lower on the roof than the old unit so almost no chance of catching tree branches. A side benefit is the bathroom is now so much better lit that I only need to use the lights at night.
B00ZE3OCB6|2|The headlights are very nice to look at them, but not very good quality. We installed them, and after only 30 minutes, the bulb melted the cover that goes over the bulb. Very disappointed.
B003HCTGBW|5|GOOD
B008PNNXA8|5|Suction out the reservoir every time I change the oil just to keep it fresh.
B000S5UMDC|1|This does not fit a 2015 Jeep Wrangler sport! Amazon said it would
B00GHTDNWA|5|Excellent product work perfect thanks
B002J7VX4Y|4|Closest thing to new car smell that I have ever tried my 40 yrs driving.
B00BFWK2PU|5|Crashed hard... saved me from a whole lot of pain. It looks awesome also!
B008PW52OY|4|Worked well for my harley heads when I rebuilt them (88)
B00TRR071O|4|I love it  a lot
B00274JM7E|5|I have had my Tempo car case and refills for over 10 years.  Unfortunately several years ago it became impossible to find the refills.
B00HFLAPOS|5|Awesome
B00HQZNOQO|1|I ordered this item as a direct replacement; The two prongs that hold the cover in place are not long enough and are too large in diameter to fit the holes in the armrest- the cover does not stay in place. Also, the two rear corners of the cover were torn. The poorest replacement product I've ever purchased for my VW.
B00OOOUY2W|2|Easy to install and worked for a short while, but not as smooth as genuine original part. Plastic connector cap broke with less than 3 months of service, designating them to the landfill.
B0007D5DZC|5|I know that Fram doesn't have the best reputation with some people, but I've been using them for 23 years, no problem. The rubberized ends make it easy to change without a wrench.
B00KTJ7IGQ|5|So easy to program
B00BJJZIYY|4|This package arrived in about three days! The mirror looks awesome. Only downfall was no where did I see a color choice so I assumed the outside cap would be black like the picture, it was red and my car is aqua blue. Not so pretty so I'll be painting it black until I can get the Aqua cap.
B000CODH0O|5|Great straps for the value.
B000EDUUHQ|5|With a motorhome you need to keep things from falling and bouncing around and these are perfect. Easy to adjust and keep things in place so you don't have things jumping out at you every time you open the doors. :)
B003RLJ8HU|5|Great quality and fit.  I tried purchasing a cheaper set of running boards and was dissatisfied with the quality.  The DeeZee boards are high quality and the fit is perfect, not too low to the ground, and not too high to make them unusable.  Wish I bought these in the first place
B00WOY33EA|5|Perfect!!
B00CIXETPO|4|Hitch itself is awesome! Very durable  I didn't receive wiring ball and receiver but got fixed  The only thing bad is receiver pin is a little sloppy in hitch  otherwise great product
B00Z7KIZPA|5|Bought as a gift for the old lady, she couldn't be happier.
B0081TVZHY|5|great looking product, 10 minute install. works great
B0050DWBJA|5|Use these to power my headlamp, and feel great not wasting batteries.
B00HT2Y80U|5|I love it
B003PL3B0W|5|This starter is purring like a kitten.  No issues.
B00CNEQYF6|5|Easy install
B003CSLLHS|5|I love it! Now I can travel with my bike. I am more than happy!!
B008T4YOV0|3|Diddn't come with a very thorough manual explaining how the helmet works. Ordered it in XL which is my usual head size, turned out to be a bit small (my fault) so i sent it back, the chin insulatior(whatever you call it) came detached on one side, it clicks back however it's still a pain to get on, although it keeps your face from freezing it's a bit of an inconvenience. I question its safety considering the overall helmet is flimsy.. i can sort of wobble the framing with and without the visor closed. There's not a lot of padding, so it makes it a bit uncomfortable, and with the visor down i find it difficult to breathe. I do however think the design is cool, the visor is not detatchable infact, there's a switch on the left side that flips the visor up and down whenever you need it. There's also optional switches to allow airflow which can be closed for cold weather or trips on the highway, still however a little difficult to breathe, especially in warmer weather. If only this helmet were more comfy and sturdy id give it full stars.
B000B5QFE4|2|It seemed like a good product but it was not to my liking.. The big ugly tension knob ruined it for me..<br />They held steady for the road test but I couldn't get passed the knob.<br />I returned and purchase the sure fit brand with no knob.
B0012P2KB4|5|great price, quick delivery, works fine
B00HLUWLEK|5|Shipped fast, Fits great, and isn't too hot. I moved to this helmet from a half shell and this helmet is actually cooler than the half shell was.
B0002T8GK0|5|Great  product.  Didn't  think i would ever find it again. Would  definitely recommend this product! You'll be  hooked.
B00BLZDH8K|5|Good quality price  decent
B00Y5E6UNI|3|Look great had a little trouble with  threading spike tips into the lug nut itself but got it in there and they look awesome
B004I15ZB6|5|Perfect Fit perfectly Easy to change.
B00FZIOHWY|5|Had a car that sat long enough for a fresh battery to go totally dead due to a draw by high amp sound system. The unit would not initially go into charge mode. Once I selected 40 amp boost and left it on for a few minutes the charger then functioned when I set it back to automatic. After 18 hours, it went into float-maintain mode.  The next day I performed a load test. The battery held full charge and passed the load test. The cooling fan never ran during charge cycle.  The transformer never actually got warm. The cabinet felt cool , never got hot. I agree with the majority of reviewers that the SE-2040-CA is a solid unit, and will give me years of trouble free service.  I read numerous comments about  holes for attaching the handle to the back were not threaded.  Not the case. The threads were cut, but when the cabinet was painted, the paint hardened making it difficult to start the screws.  A good phillips screw driver and applied steady pressure broke through the paint. The screws then were easily tightened. I added a couple flat washers to each side of the axle to keep the wheels from rubbing the sides of the charger cabinet.  I have a Scag and a couple riders that I'll keep ready to put back into service each spring. No more frozen batteries after winter storage. This unit was well worth the price.  Kudos to Amazon for fast shipping.
B00ZQ384UY|5|Fits my 1999 528i perfect
B00E5PK8TE|5|I have been very pleased with the Harley Davidson brand battery that lasted for 7 years in my Road King Classic. So I did extensive research and monitored reviews on this battery before replacing my HD battery which was still going strong. This is a better value with comparable performance.
B00891G8LM|5|Exactly as described. High Quality!
B0019IERYW|4|The Walker 36124 spout I received looks different than the standard picture but it's of good quality and condition.  There is no screws as shown in the picture to secure the spout to the muffler pipe but I could slid to over the pipe snugly for the first inch by hand and then use a rubber mallet for the rest of the way.  It'll be difficult to take the spout back out without damaging it so make good measurements before starting to hammer.
B009LUQFMC|4|Super bright. Adds a cleaner look to the interior and literally a 5 munite installation. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because the two map lights in order to work you cant just push them all the way into the sockets because they won't light up but you had to pull them out just slightly. They stay in place though! I do recomended them.
B000C5BYFS|4|Fit exact real motor craft part just what I needed came ahead of time
B000E4PNCC|5|I love it it fit perfert
B00YVQD4A2|4|They are very close to 5 stars. My wire frames aren't as secure as my regular frames. Otherwise, great holder!!!!!
B008KV4IIG|5|I was having a problem with my onan 5kw gen set on my 2011 forest river rv. Read several places to go with aftermarket brand as they are better quality. Sisde by side this unit is a direct replacement, and does appear to be a quality pump. Solved my gen set issues, runs great now. I would recommend replacing the fuel filter at the same time if you replace this.
B00N2BTAX2|5|Fantastic!!
B00QSX3EWY|5|Comes with everything needed to install onto my 98 jeep Cherokee 4.0 and sounded great. The removal of the factory system was harder than installing the new one due to rust. Good tuned sound with practically no drone at regular driving rpm. Sounds good when revving and growls at low and high rpm. Would definitely recommend.
B007473JCI|5|Fit perfectly on my 01 shadow..
B00K56PPAY|1|I drive a  2009 Nissan Murano it does not fit my window at all does not the In place falls down
B00NZISBJ6|5|Love it, good quality and fitment ;)
B008ZU4AR6|3|Helmet looks great!<br />I wish it fit right...<br /><br />This helmet is built for someone with a perfect orb for a head.<br />...My head is NOT a perfect orb...<br /><br />The helmet is way to tight front to back, pressing on my forhead, yet way too loose side to side.<br /><br />Unfortunate<br /><br />I really wanted to love this helmet.<br /><br />Now I will have to figure out returning it...
B00CQAR1V8|5|It worked perfectly and only took 2hours to replace
B004R3DPEY|5|Perfect fit!
B00E4UC8EI|1|Cheap car set covers didi not fir my truck sets tore up after a week i will not ever buy off this site again
B00I5HRTU4|5|very happy
B00AOTBVJQ|4|&#34;Good Flaring Kit&#34;<br />This flaring kit was a different design from the ordinary ones that don't work, so I thought I'd try it. I tried it out right away and the very first double  flare I made was noticeably better than the ones I made with my old flaring kit. If you carefully assemble the die halfs, take your time and use a lubrication on the cone and line you will be OK. I have a whole car to do and hope it survives, I am using copper/nickel tubing which is softer than steel which also makes it easier, don't even think about it for stainless lines.
B005O01N8E|5|Fit perfect on my c70 !
B00MG1FWEU|5|Very Nice
B00P9R8NYO|3|It arrived on schedule.  I installed the seat cover and the strap broke one day later.  Sadly, every time I get into my driver seat it needs to be held in place so that it is positioned properly. Then I need to pull up the back side.<br />It is smaller than anticipated however, it works.  Next time I'll purchase the full seat beaded covers.
B000CAINDE|3|It does the job, but when it folds up, it's so thick that it takes up a lot of space in the car.
B00CEXKC2M|5|This is a great addition to our 2015 Chevy Silverado! It should help prevent any rock chips and the smooth fit looks awesome!
B005HMJIIQ|4|I haven't installed trunk or glove box but as for map, dome and license plate they are much brighter than stock bulbs. Worth the purchase.
B00H6ETIWY|4|Work great, easy install
B006YCNAO6|5|Fowler Volkswagon is a great seller to deal with. They followed up with me to make sure I was satisfied. What? Shipping was prompt, product arrived early actually, and in great shape. The product is as described. I am not a big sunshade guy, this is my first actually - they always looked like such a pain in the ass. But this one is obviously superior to those I have seen before obtained from a free giveaway or auto parts store. Those are flimsy, loose, and look like a giant aluminum bunny took a crap on your dashboard. This shade has layers of thermal barrier material, goes in fast, comes out fast, stays in place and most importantly, keeps the damn heat out. It is not an absolutely perfect fit - there is maybe an inch or two on each end where sunlight creeps through, but as close as you can reasonably expect. For anyone new to sunshades, hook it around the rearview mirror first and do one side then the other. Remember you can rotate the shade and pull it up and back before it is all the way in place. It is quite easy.
B00LNK43FY|5|Exactly what is was looking for! Looks great... no flaws... fast shipping. would definitely purchase again.
B00YMTXTFS|5|Delivery was quick.  Chain was perfect for my anchor.
B00AF232NK|5|Part came quick...BMW part..easy purchase
B001DN1L6K|5|Easy to install. Excellent reception.
B009DK2WMC|5|Nice piece ,  thicker than factory<br /> Will buy again .
B00LICYNPM|5|OEM parts with a discount. would order again when needed.
B000AZ3AZW|5|Good quality, lays flat and easy to clean.  Watch surface when wet very slippery when wet especially if you have on rubber soled shoes like sneakers.
B001LHVOVK|4|simple to use, no bells and whistles but good deal for price
B000FQ1SWI|3|After a few months the legs started to loose shape.
B00EHOR8LY|5|Great for towing
B00473W5V8|5|Got my rear window sealed.
B000NRUG0O|5|Came fast just what I wanted I could not see the oil level on my 05 6.0 psd and the plastic had broken would recommend
B00GEV9LIG|2|The sticker is outlined in the logo so it's kinda difficult to peel off without it tearing or getting stuck together. Not what I had hoped for.
B00C30GXG0|4|It didn't reduce the heat much in this hot summer, but it is better than nothing. The quality is fine, fit my car well.
B000A09MFE|5|Good
B00KSXX3BC|5|Work perfectly, easy installation on E66, great price.
B002KO893Y|4|installed these on a 2015 road glide special. Purchased after confirming directly with Kuryakyn that this is the correct model for my bike. As stated in other reviews, the mounting brackets on the stock Harley do not line up correctly with mounting points on these board covers.  Noticing a bit more vibration in my foot is well… Will put a couple of thousand miles on them and then decide if I'm going to switch back to stock. This being said they look great and I would recommend them
B001H3T43S|1|not red, orange wtf
B00KNXACFC|3|I took them to the nissan dealer ,they set up for<br />Car lock  and unlock.
B000CM0X4Y|1|Fell off after i attached it to the mirror
B008720YYA|5|worked as promised.  truck started first crank. i was so happy.
B000G2AOU8|5|great product fast shipping
B00DUGVHTE|1|Threads were melted in the 3/8-16 holes. Had to repair to make it work.
B00REJXRY6|5|Works very well.
B00OGLHQLU|5|Very compact size and easy to use. Limited instructions included with item. To open to replace fuse, unscrew the tip. This is the 1/3 portion of the plastic housing on the tip end. To open to solder the wires, unscrew the tip and remove the fuze. Then separate the two halves of the housing. There is what appears to be a seam running length wise all the way around the item. Insert two thumbs into end where fuze was and pull two halves apart.
B000C9SJUC|3|fit perfect
B00AU20G3E|5|Its wonderful!
B000X1G0R8|4|Works ok, Thought the flame would be bigger. And the electric start doesn't work worth crap. I use a lighter.
B00FH8P1DG|4|Very good light for the price. Nice and bright. But does not produce a full 30 amps runs at 18 amps so about 150 watts. But very good still. Would say at the price its nice.
B000C5O1VW|1|It was listed incorrectly for the vehicle. It does not fit and will not work for the car. If you have a Hyundia do not bother with this, it will not fit.
B003IHMHLW|5|Much better fit than the original. Able to hoist up the trailer while items are on it.
B0000AXYK4|5|I had a boat cover that I used it on and it did the job.
B003SOJVEQ|5|Appears to be same as original equipment. Excellent.
B001MU28TI|5|Excelente producto!!!
B005Y5TW0K|5|Not the highest quality helmet but nicer then I expected for the price. I would trust it. My girlfriend loves it and it fits as expected compared to other helmets. Looks very nice, graphics are well done.
B000NKGBDW|5|Great product and great price!
B00JRHI1LM|5|Very happy with this mattress. 100% improvement over the old original mattress we had. I have never slept as well as I have in the camper till we bought this mattress and I just spent 7 nights sleeping on it. Nice thick and firm mattress. One note: The short queen rv sheets we have with a fitted top sheet at the bottom do not stay in place. This mattress is to thick for them. We will be getting standard queen sheets and see if they fit better. This is the best upgrade I have done yet for our 5th wheel.
B000RD91YQ|5|Perfect fit on 1999 Jeep Cherokee XJ.
B000CIXNYU|4|Product exactly as describe.
B0033ZTAOQ|5|Greatstuff, my son loves it
B007HS0PAI|4|I ordered this because it was unclear if one came with the smart charger from the same company came with one. I should have waited. There was one included with the smart charger. Now I have two of them. Could return it unopened, but it isn't worth the effort. And, I'll have a spare. The smart charger seems to be functioning as it should, and was a good purchase.
B00SXVDJ10|5|Arrived fast, easy install. Bolts right on. Can feel the extra power on this old motor.
B009CI3BES|3|Its ok to say the least, i ordered one foe my ford taurus to and its made of a better material<br />just love it this one for my baby my ram 1500 is just so so
B00MBURW6M|5|very cool and super easy to attach to car window.  get many comments on it!
B004W4MDQ4|5|Easy to install. Look great. Thank you very much
B001KOYY2U|1|the power steering pressure hose  LEAKS
B00EKT217C|4|As good if not better than the others out there.  So far so good and mine is able to hold three sport coats at once.  Recommend !
B00G27F03C|2|This sticker is not as appears in the picture. In fact in trying to take a picture from my phone i was not able to get close enough to show the poor quality of this sticker... now if you know anything about graphic arts .. you will understand that a &#34; Clear &#34; size of a graphic gets distorted when you blow it up .. the lines are not clean, they are staired on the edges... I was so disappointed in seeing this especially for the money. This in my opinion is not an original factory sticker .. seems like a blow up of a smaller copy... not cool !
B000C16XPI|5|Prefect solution to a problem that I had going on 5 years. I should have ordered this a lot sooner and total time of replacement was done in less than an hour, with the help of youtube. Very happy with my choice to purchase thru Amazon and not spent $45 at a junk yard. Just replaced on 8/17/2015. I will be ordering another for my other door very soon.
B00DSR46H0|5|I'm very happy with the floor mats!!  They look fab with my red car!
B00VN3J8OM|5|Good
B00AEC9DNY|5|Excellent product, direct fit, fast delivery. Seller met all expectations. Will purchase from seller again!
B00JDPOVKI|4|A lot of wind noise, but otherwise comfortable.
B005JL3EJO|5|Great!
B00N27W7FO|5|Fit perfect just don't forget gaskets, I was rebuilding my upper engine so I had the gaskets all ready.
B003ZS7232|4|Not bad to install. I made it harder than it had to be because I like things perfect. Works well, but the hard part was running the wire to the battery. Pain in the behind. If I were to do it again I would find 12v at the back end (interior lights, or aux power outlet) and just switch my trailer lights to LEDs. Less current draw that the aux source fuse can handle.  2011 Toyota Sienna Limited AWD
B00BCT2L4Q|1|Quality of the item weak, look like it should made in your back yard no tack that back my 12 year son could better paint job. no warranty no refund.  video looks cool but just another info commercial
B00N7ZPJC4|5|I ordered these for my new 2015 Chevy 2500. They fit great. Should protect the carpet from the elements.
B00UGSNR74|5|Much better than i was expecting. As other reviews have said the rope that comes with the hammock could be better so it's a good idea to order something else, but other than that I could not be more pleased with the hammock especially for the price.
B0076PTDEQ|5|Item as described and packaged appropriately! Recommended! A+!
B00652G4TS|5|This is a must have product for the backyard mechanic such as myself. Great interface, pretty fast transfer of downloads, and very good  list (so far ;) )  of repair/troubleshooting  information. The geek inside is a happy camper.
B008LPEZ6Q|5|Good stuff.  I have a Ford Fusion with navigation screen and My Ford Touch.  This stuff cleans that screen right up with no smearing.  Makes the interior like factory.
B000CQ6ECK|5|Better fit and product than expected<br /> Will recommended and buy it again.<br />My first gen lightning looks better now :)
B006H33ZU6|5|wicked lights  wish i would have purchased alot sooner
B0030M0WQM|5|Worked awesome as a flag mount on my High Roller Big Wheel
B000WER73C|5|Love them
B007KPTEGO|5|Good
B00J594B52|5|Eats away the rust
B00HSHW03I|5|Love them...
B013W43PHA|5|thanks works good for safety
B00BCR8SLS|1|Dont waste your money or time with this. It looks cheap and very wrinkly and tacky..
B00B43T6IO|2|This is not a bad price considering how expensive oem replacement LCAs are. However I am pretty sure that my ball joints are shot after about 6mo of use. Spend money on a better product because I basically wasted mine.
B00M2RAZ1S|5|Good product
B001O0AN16|5|could not find the short shank nuts locally. Everybody could order them. But so could I, and I did and got these. They fit fine and look much better than my 15 year old lug nuts on my MGB with Shelby Viper wheels from 40 years ago.
B000O1C47M|5|Very fast. Does everything I expected it to do.
B007Y85RXG|5|Fit on a 2002 impala LS 3.8 it's probably a really cheaply made chinese alternator, but it works better than the old one.
B00S209URY|2|The infinity loops are very small.
B008S9CHU6|5|great helmet
B00X7IA3OU|5|I had a dash light on in my 2000 Toyota Sienna.  This fixed the problem
B008HSLTGQ|5|Have had for 3 years and still works!
B001LHVOVK|5|It works and it is cheap.  Perfect!
B00RM7H2ZA|5|Originally I sent them an email of what color I want but they sent me the wrong color.  I simply sent the sender an email and they sent me another free of charge.  I have had it on my car for months now and it is great.  It hasn't chipped or anything.  It is so perfect.
B00DSCZ5ZW|5|Fast install on my 2003 SL500.<br />Use a screwdriver to pop off the springs for  the old lifts.  Once you figure that out, installation is quick and easy.  Although, it's best to have a friend nearby to hold up the trunk.
B004303BNQ|3|For a rug that's suppose to be outside I wish it was made a little thicker it's so light it blows away when it's windy!
B0093AA8V4|5|Nice
B00496TJ6M|1|This pump failed after going about a half a mile!! What a pain. Had to get a different pump and pay to have it installed again.  Don't mess around with this POS-you get what you pay for.
B00IJEV66G|5|great plate covers! they are not cheap plastic at all, pretty much exactly what I expected!
B007MUY6T2|5|Quick delivery...just what was needed
B00DL6T2YK|5|very well made, excellent tool!
B00QRTQ9LC|5|You can't beat the price on this. Install only took 5 minutes. Looks great up under my hood.
B008RPND54|5|Haven't  blown out yet... the color i ordered what more can I ask for
B004HH5BFQ|5|Every car needs one!
B00KTIIF1O|5|Awesome decal I love it!
B0010Z4MDK|5|The battery listed as used, but appears new.  The item was a perfect replacement for my garage door opener with battery backup. I will be sure to check out ExpertPower for my future battery needs.
B000WK4EC8|5|Have been using S100 for years and there is nothing that works as well as it for easy bike cleaning
B000CLWVX6|5|Seems just as good as original factory model, fits perfectly, easy install.
B00BCR8SLS|1|Luckily these were cheap, it's a very thin, fake leather look, picture doesn't show actual details of the material. Too big for my car
B00QSESJEQ|3|Ok for the price
B009YRI64C|5|So cute! Seller will even customize it to your family. Awesome buy!
B000VKODIO|1|DOES NOT FIT 2007 TOYOTA HIGHLANDER.  Description said this was a fit for our 2007 Toyota Highlander Hybrid, it clearly was the wrong size.  It also is very flimsy and not near the quality of the Toyota OEM cabin filter, so spent the extra $ for the OEM one. Beware buying this product.
B00O0E60M4|5|Great for Resident Evil fans!  Good quality.
B00230KKJQ|5|Been using this for years.  It lubricates my motorcycles o-ring chain very well, and I've always gotten the most life out of my chain with the help of PJ1 Blue Label.  Though it can easily fling off if it is applied liberally.  This can usually be avoided if you let the bike sit a day or two after applying.  Happy riding
B002H8FYTU|4|nice.
B00P2MN8VO|5|This a a large waterproof bag that you can attach to your roll bars. I have mine on my 2door JK on the rear roll bars, and I store a rain jacket, and some bungies. it's a pretty decent size, and you could store plenty inside of it. attaches quickly with buckles, and the bag is made of waterproof material. the zipper also has a hood. it's a great little gear bag for storing things you want to keep water out of.
B000VJQXG0|5|Worked great
B004R2Y64S|4|As others have noted, the tiny little hex-security wrench will not get the job doen for tightening these down to the car.  I recommend using a rachet!
B000BZAAJK|5|Fit my 2002 F150 XL 4x4 perfectly.  Exact replacement to the factory original Timken hubs -- hoping to get another 100k miles out of these.  Took about an hour per wheel to install.
B001G7NR9W|5|Super quick delivery.  Fits perfectly.
B007RHBASK|5|Loved this product exactly what I was looking for.
B00061SGZO|4|this tool works very well. I am glad I bought it ,made the job much easier
B000CZ3474|5|Excellent product work perfect on my 1981 Toyota Corolla I recommended,, thanks
B004YGEOZS|2|The color of this is wonderful, and the design. Cause who doesn't love Pikachu.<br />  I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend, he had it on his keys for a day or so and it's already broken. Just...really.<br />  The little clip part broke off, really disappointed.
B003C1D0L0|1|Coating scratched, spiderwebed after two track days.  Very fragile.  Going to try the smoked lens.
B000WK2ID0|5|Black wrinkle in a spray can. Outstanding appearance. A must for those who wish to hide an unsightly area on a motorcycle, car, engine or any surface for that matter.
B0016ZU3AU|2|This blade worked nicely for 7 months and then broke into two pieces. I have used Bosch products for years and I an greatly disappointed.
B001G4Z5J0|5|It is heavy, sturdy, and well made.  Claims to carry up to 500 lbs.  Unlike some reviews I read, I found it easy to assemble.  Eight (8) bolts/nuts of one size, and three (3) of a bigger one to attach two sides to the bar that attaches to the receiver hitch on your car/SUV.  Just make sure you position it correctly so the carrier sits higher and gives you more ground clearance.  Consider if you can stow it in your garage, if you have one. I am because its heavy (48 lbs) and you don't want to haul it too far.<br />Most importantly, it doubles your capacity if you have a small SUV.  My dogs take up the back seat,  and this turned my GLK into and ML !!
B004ZF31PC|5|Excellent 100%
B0031HT8JS|5|Replaced these in minutes, very easy to install and a great price.
B00GRRFLOK|5|Nice wheel Chock ... for the money well worth it !!
B00ARJQPIK|5|Absolutely fixed my hard to diagnose engine problems in about five minutes. Perfect fit, great price. No regrets at all.
B008454NA6|5|This is a great chock for a CHOPPER. If you have a regular bike the Harbor Freight $39 chock works just as well
B00CH8RK42|4|Not quite as heavy duty as I was expecting, but fits great, and seems to work well. A huge improvement over the stock Hyundai crappy plastic cargo mat.
B003Y8NTFS|4|Nice set of tools for the $$. Easy to get out and put back in.
B003SRHNE8|5|These car seats covers help to cover up my car seats which sometimes double as my office and/or restaurant!
B00O4D7KM0|5|These are pricey but worth it. Since I put these in I get no dust coming up from the floor like before. I would buy them again.
B007NNH122|4|husband was pleased
B003YMRO1Y|4|Good fit, works
B005DM5Y5Q|5|Love it fits perfect
B005909KWA|5|Cool
B0013BH7WO|5|Fits perfect, suggest using locking nuts and better washers
B00079FOK0|5|Good tight fit and comfortable over prolonged wear. Filters do the job as evidenced by crud stuck in them at end of a day's painting. Glad it's not in my lungs.
B00UNTU3VO|5|I've had a California Duster for four years that am pretty happy with(except for the occasional red fibre that gets left behind)time for a new one and did some research and yours was most recommended so I gave it a go.<br />More expensive but a better product.<br />Handle is cool and the pick up is better<br />Love it and am getting another for my friends new Benz
B002SAR54O|5|Fit perfectly my 2015 tundra Sr5 double cab. Easy installation
B001NZQIDE|5|Worked perfect to connect to OEM plug in for controller, installs in 30 seconds
B00G5MSC8E|5|Exact match to the ones I ordered elsewhere.  Would order again!
B003L2ZVRG|3|Remains &quot;tacky&quot; too long
B00062YUUS|5|Already paid,for itself. works like a dream.
B000AA4RWM|5|Perfect for RV leveling, nice quality for the price
B001LNK1JK|5|It was great. Pleased with it
B00KM6IA3Q|5|Perfect
B001RLZ7S6|5|batter then Bosch
B00GJMQ9C6|4|Very good jacket for the price. I wore it on a 27 hour ride. From low 60's F at night to a high of 103 F during the day. The rain liner is PVC. It blocked airflow so I could stay warm at night. During the day the jacket allowed enough air flow to stay comfortable as long as I was moving. I think it's better made than other jackets I've seen in the same price range. The fit - I'm..ummm...stout and it fits nicely. If you have an athletic build it's likely to fit a bit loose but it does have waist straps to snug it down.
B00JMLEWXY|5|This tool is awesome!  It was easy to use. It was easy to remove and install rockers and it was easy to use the tool to push springs enough to remove and install valve keepers.
B000ZFUYOM|5|I replaced my old vent with this one. Fit perfect n looks great.
B00159JWTU|5|Go-Rhino makes some great stuff, and the 3160B is no exception. It provides a great way to access the rear of the engine bay via the built in step, and a perfect mounting platform for lights, siren speakers, etc via the flat crossmember in the middle. Two sets of pre-drilled holes allow you some flexibility with mounting your equipment (I currently have a set of LED auxiliary lights mounted to it, but they will be moved to a different location once my 30&#34; light bar arrives). The inside edge to edge measurement of the crossmember is just over 34&#34;, so you could fit up to a 32&#34; light bar in the space depending on what type of mounting feet it uses. The powdercoating is very high quality, and the included instructions are pretty straightforward if you have some basic knowledge of the underside of your vehicle. All of the necessary hardware was included, and although there were some tight spots to get the ratchet into, everything went together without issue. Great product for the money.
B00EOTTJJG|3|very thin plastic
B000VS8DZU|3|I had a crack in my wall to wall flooring.  This seems to have sealed the crack but you can still see it.
B00HTP8N0I|4|The loops felt a little thin so I doubled up on each side of the bike. Pulled the bike 2200 miles on the trailer and the loops held find.  No issues.
B005OJ3UHC|5|great, easy to install.
B007V2DW46|5|it was gift that went over really well!  fits perfectly.
B00GTXSEKK|3|I like the case. It's just that the screw keeps coming undone and I've lost two so far. Next one I will use lock-tite.
B0055AW0N0|1|Does not fit between seats as expected.
B00JQ5RBXE|5|Look and fit great. beetle looks like new once again
B00T4X9AVE|2|Product is  so bulky that I could not use it in my car
B000NVW1LM|5|Worked fast as indicated.  I had an oil leak from the rear of my engine, which I believed was the rear main seal.  I had to keep an oil drip pan under my truck to catch my previous oil drips from staining my concrete.  I put this ATP Re-seal in with an oil change and the oil leak stopped within a few days.  That was 2 months ago.  No drips on the oil drip pan.
B001THSTWY|5|Replaced the yellow hazy original lights, not only do they look great I can see better at night
B000CINB56|5|You have to love Bilsteins. Always worth the extra dough. Make my old truck better than new.
B000B8GAKA|5|works well
B0034ZYE5U|5|THE RIGHT SIZE AND IS LIGHT WEIGHT!
B00DJ5KEF4|5|Works great on my battery tender plugs I have on all my toys.
B00OBJ8VAM|5|They look awesome and fast delivery thank you
B0007ZL174|5|It is what it is and that is good
B000QGZXCS|5|EXCELLENT PRODUCT ..EXCELLENT VENDOR
B00BYV4CL2|5|Great. Fit my wife's car perfectly and so easy to clean.
B00BUNDDS2|5|Great quality. Fits perfect! Very satisfied!
B004NFW5EC|5|Best I've used.
B0059929HO|5|Great product, easy install. My packaging was tore up due to handling and the product received a few dings on the corners. Nothing major, just an observation. I have not used the product yet but it seems to be up for the task.
B002VE3VHW|5|We are very please with this cover.  The price is great and it actually looks very nice on top of the mower.  Too bad when we take off this nice, new, clean cover the mower underneath looks like it needs to be retired from service.
B00C566I76|1|Left muffler fit excellent, but they don't seem to have a direct-fit for the right side, email for help and never got any. I don't want to put a different kind of muffler on the other side, it may hurt the engine and the performance.
B00I5LCEAA|3|These work great to keep the plates in place but I wish they would stack without actually sitting on the plates below.  You have to remove the smaller unit to get to the plates in the lower unit.  I used these in a trailer where space is as much a consideration as movement when traveling down the road.
B00FB7YJCM|5|Just what I was looking for. Fit perfectly, and looks good.
B00P1W7C7Q|5|I received it in 8 days super fast from over seas & throttle is NCY brand took 1/2 hr to install on tao tao 150 sure beats stock throttle!
B00JIHC36K|5|I used these to replace a 194 bulb . The bulb was for a front fender light on a 2009 flhtc Harley Davidson. It was just what I was looking for. I have a smoked lens and I needed something bright to use with it. This bulb is plenty bright. It is a little more yellow than amber but serves the purpose well. I am very happy with it.
B002WPXVC0|5|Fast shipping, exactly as advertised.
B00LBNH8NW|5|Excellent
B009W4QPN6|5|As advertised. fit perfectly. Will buy again. Quick shipping too.
B007O1XBQS|5|great product
B000CD8I5O|5|The best wiper, so quite!
B000C5SG8G|5|Worked like a charm. I own a 1997 Toyota 4runner with the one O2 Sensor after the cat. When you install, use new bolts and grease them also. You should drive the truck for a couple days to let the engine's computer get used to the new O2 sensor, then you should pass emissions! My truck ran better and got better gas mileage as a result also!!
B001G7MZ68|5|Great price on pricey BMW parts
B00VKNU1PU|5|Perfect replacement to latch/lock on 2005 Laredo trailer.  Exact Fit. Very well made of heavy steel.
B00D2I0IAE|5|Very nice tool helped me take care of my Problems.its not hard to use at all and a dream to use.
B001UFUD0G|2|Has a strong chemical smell. I can't put them in my car until that smell dissipates some. They've been airing out over night and the smell is still there.<br /><br />UPDATE: We finally got the covers in the car. Amazon said it would fit my Impreza. They don't. The head rest covers are too large.<br /><br />We had to cut holes into the covers for the head rests.<br /><br />The latches used to strap the covers onto the seats ripped off. The material is very cheap.
B00YA0MG4E|3|Good design, fits in them tight clearance on my 2013 Tahoe.  Other bulbs with a fan would be a difficult fit.  While they were very bright, I returned them because they seemed to scatter the light too much and were too blue for my taste.  I'd say these joule work much better in a projector light than a reflector like the Chevy has.
B00063WUJA|5|Sturdy quality. they are holding up the front end of my 5th wheel at this moment. I like 'em!
B00L7XDGL4|5|Fits my 98 dodge 1500 ss/t great shipping was great timing, no scratches or mess ups great packaging
B00T3NZQCW|1|Terrible radiator<br />The high pressure, oem hose wont fit for my 98 Jeep Grand Cherokee 5.2 4x4. Also, the return line of the radiator was broken; add to that a broken top screw. I just kept it and fixed this with JB weld because I needed a radiator ASAP. Note that I am getting a new one so I can literally throw this one in the garbage can.
B001B7BUA0|2|Very speedy and correct service on order and shipping from Amazon.<br />This is a generic wire control heater valve.  It didn't work out for me and I'll tell you why.<br />My car is a 1994 Honda Accord EX 5 speed made in Kentucky.  This is not like the OEM valve.<br />The angle where the control cable comes is not like the OEM and will require some cutting of hoses to get it to work right.<br />The other problem is that the pipes are 1/2 inch diameter which is smaller than OEM.  The OEM spring clamps will not<br />tighten the hose enough.  I tried it and it leaked plenty; even with the engine cold and not running.  I didn't try it but it will probably work with screw clamps if you want to use it on a metric car.  I decided to try to make the old valve work and succeeded.<br /><br />There seem to be two designs of valves with the same part number.<br />The first one I got had movement between the lever and the axle of the valve.  It was a swaged fit and was loose.  Very poor design.<br />I used Amazon's easy retun/replacement gadget on my order page and that was easy to use and the replacemnt came in a couple of days.<br />The second one had a phillips screw to tighten the joint going down into the valve axle.  This one worked correctly.  I would suggest you specify the design with the screw.  I would not use the swaged one without the screw if I could help it.  It is a weak design and while it may work for a while, I would not trust it if I had any option.<br />The valve with the axle screw looks like a good valve and could work in many situations including in the '94 Accord but it will need some better clamps and some fooling around for that car.  It could be excellent for other applications.  I sent them both back in one package.<br />I hope this review helps somebody avoid wasting time like I did.
B00EC8YEEE|5|I love this product they look and work great five stars all the way
B00TZ1EDN0|5|It's just a simple replacement antenna base. Item came as described and in Mopar packaging. Very easy to change out. Bought 2 to be used to change out the base whenever it becomes sun bleached.
B007V2CPWG|5|Work great. Made out of quality material
B006VFEJJQ|5|*the little plastic hose **must** be connected.  Charging batteries emits hydrogen gas (explosive) in confined space.  That hose is mandatory as I saw other reviews saying they omitted the vapor hose vent.  Very pleased with battery.  Shipping was safe and fast.  Fully charged upon receiving and installed perfectly like OEM.  This is a VERY high quality battery.  I will buy another for 2nd car. Update: our 2010 Prius has never ran so well.  Starts gas engine less due to higher reserve power of this battery.  Headlamps brighter now.  Saved us over $340.  At dealership
B0009SQQ1A|5|This surge protector saved our butts. Our park power is really old direct bury and had animal chewing on it and shorted out. We would have lost all of our electronics and maybe worse. It came through for us.
B0006MRRU8|5|as described. Thanks!
B003QK5QKU|3|good
B004SD1P4A|5|Great Item - Fast Shipping - Will Purchase Again
B0050EGJLA|4|If this room would have a waterproof floor in it, I would give it 5 stars. Otherwise it does the job.
B00BJL29QM|1|Have very little smell
B000C13U7W|2|i purchased three controllers for the ride and two were Dorman units well packed and as represented.  the third was a vietnemese unit poorly pcked and appeared to be of lesser quality.  the spool that winds the cable fell out of the housing and unrolled as it was not zip tied to prevent that as were the Dorman units.  i returned the vietnemese unit and ordered another to replace it and the replacement was/is the same different part.<br /><br />i am uneasy installing the part as it is not a quick fix if it fails.  am awaiting the response of the seller who is VERY hard to contact
B00HPR4MIM|5|I was pleasantly surprised this came as a Momo part! I have no idea from the description, I just thought it would be a generic piece probably from Asia. But Italian quality for that price can't be beat. Easy to install.
B005MZ1BY2|3|ok
B00EU1R9BI|5|Great head lamp... fits my Mazda CX-9 perfect.
B0027EUPFC|4|It did the trick granddaughter Happy.
B001H1M9TQ|5|Exactly item fit on my ford fusion 2008
B000BZ93HK|5|low cost replacement same as stock
B003SOKEXI|2|Bought to replace my stock one which I thought was causing issues.  Turns out it was not my stock switch and I'm thankful for that, as this replacement was physically bigger and did not sit properly.  It was bought for 2002 F150 Supercrew.
B00R8LCC2I|1|Returning radiator due to major transmission fluid leakage around where it's machined to the radiator and I'm a very unsatisfied costumer.
B0072UIU4Y|4|Installed on wife's 2013 Dodge Durango Crew. Class III receiver was delivered as described. Install took about 25 minutes on a lift. Only issue was mounting plate on receiver was slightly bent, so had to be manipulated a little bit for proper fit. I recommend lowering spare tire and removing plastic trim around spare for an easier install. Tubular design looks nice and there was no cutting of the rear facia for proper fitment. Gave 4 out of 5 stars due to bent mounting plate, but still recommend as an alternative to dealer install.
B00LK2OVD4|5|Perfect fit.
B00THRMSCA|1|The size chart is wrong. The large was supposed to fit our road glide and it does not. Very disappointed.
B000C2CN5Q|4|Fel-Pro is always a good choice.
B00YWRGSEE|5|Great product.  The skins fit perfectly on my key fobs and add protection.
B004GBJSZW|5|Product was exactly as described and at a great price and very fast delivery !!! Will be back to this sellers page !!!
B00GBQ740Q|5|Proper fit out of the box.  I use to get about 33 or 34 mpg on long trips,  with the new K&N filter I received 36.9 mpg on a trip to upper state N.Y. and over to N.H. and then down thru Boston and back to M.D.  The K&N filter works.
B00BQYCIVI|1|waffle weave is not very absorbant. just not impressed. I found better options at walmart.
B003554TB8|5|I have a hard carrier, but got tried of lifting it...too heavy even when empty!  Did my research, checked out different models of soft top carriers and kept coming back to this one based on reviews, price, waterproof and the cubic feet space. It holds a ton and it's very durable, but I haven't tested the waterproof aspect yet. Just took it to the beach and back without a single compliant, I followed the directions exactly and that was the key!  A+
B0006SH4HS|5|Don't use this in a area without good ventilation and avoid breathing it in as much as possible and you should be good. Product is a 3 for health hazard and isn't great for you, but works wonders for cleaning floor mats, wheel wells, and tires along with a whole bunch of other stuff. Gallon size will last me a long time and dilution ratios allow me to customize solution strength for a variety of cleaning. I use it mostly 10:1 and 5:1 in a 24oz Walmart spray bottle.
B00AXE635O|1|I really don't find a point in buying this and I regret buying it...it doesn't tint any lights. It's literally the same color as the lights. Horrible buy.
B00OZX7CF4|5|Excellent fit!
B003TQ3JQ4|5|Swapped the Harley-Davidson synthetic oil in my '08 Ultra to Red Line. The engine runs much cooler with this than the HD oil.
B00NQ9I5WC|5|Works great for our camper!  Nice having soft water at our seasonal spot.
B000YPL6PO|1|Had to give one star to write a review these are junk harbor freight sells the same ones for less money with the same bad quality use one time and broken
B0012PT1U2|4|Good product; however, I am now having problems with one of them.
B00DDV2NL2|3|Good for basic diagnostics...great iPad/iPhone interface
B005T21KJO|1|Description says it will fit a 2008 Dodge Ram 6.7 Cummins but is not true. Don't waste your time or money like I did. Might fit 5.9?
B00079FOK0|5|Great quality item best mask I've ever owned , plug and play right out of the box
B00651CLCS|5|Love the look on my Wrangler and do not notice any loss of signal.
B0019C2VIW|1|Did not come with a wiring harness like it said it would. Not pleased.
B00498DSM6|5|Exactly what Honda service dept would replace original belt with.
B00B2QFIVC|2|everything from quality to fit is cheap about this.
B001BDJY5M|1|The box was damaged, the frame was cracked.
B00CD8H8QG|5|fits like a glove,works great.
B0049WP7CG|4|ok
B00JSJMV38|5|The Mid size fit my 2016 Mazda CX-5 pretty tight. Although you can feel the smell when you are really close to it, it is the only one cover I can find to fit my steering wheel.
B009DJQOY0|4|If your on a budget this is perfect for you! It arrived as described and fit perfectly. The same part from a Chrysler dealer will cost you $500 or more.
B000COBK8A|5|Great horns loud
B005FV2RQY|4|Fit and works well. Great price.
B002OEYC2W|5|It's great

B00BYH6C1E|5|I love these! They work perfectly! I would recommend them to everyone!!
B000EDUUNU|4|Going to work great in my camper skiing this winter!
B00AEFUM7C|5|The detail is amazing and just makes me want a keychain in the gun form to have them next to each other
B00ZCE2Z5W|5|First of all, I have no clue why people said the product was unsafe because it doesn't at all give off that impression. This set of lights is extremely easy to use and functional. The lights are very bright but can also be dimmed very low. There is a good variety of colors but it wouldn't hurt to have a couple more. The heat shrink is okay however a heat gun wouldn't shrink it completely. I had to use a lighter to shrink it completely. Nonetheless it did its job. I also wish the wires were a little bit longer but it isn't a big deal. A big flaw of this set of lights is the adhesive on the back. GET IT RIGHT THE VERY FIRST TIME. I messed up one of them so I had to attach Velcro to it but it actually is very secure and if you have some, use the Velcro. The cigarette lighter plug is also a tad loose fitting but it could be my car(1994 Toyota Camry). Even though it's an old car, it holds up well with the lights though. The IR sensor is actually rather well made and functions well. You don't have to point it directly at it for it to work. The wires were easy to hide, again partially because my car is older. The little connectors are tad odd but, again, they function, so who cares. In all, these lights are perfect for someone who is on a budget. Although they are oddly constructed, it's easy to install and cheap.  UPDATE: 6 months later  None of the lights have broken and still function exactly as they did a long time ago. Also I noticed that the owners of the company used the pictures I posted for the picture for the product. So far the only thing that has given me issues is the power cord going to the distributor. The cord often comes loose from the distributor with a rather small amount of force. As a solution to this problem, I used some electrical tape to secure the cord to the distributor. So in all, when installing this kit: Attach the adhesive to a clean surface the first time otherwise you might have to use something like Velcro.  Use something such as electricaltape to secure the cord to the distributor.  Use a lighter if a heat gun doesn't actually shrink the heat shrink.   Those three things will help your installation go extremely smoothly and last a long time.
B001QK1X5O|4|It's not going to stop anyone from taking your trailer if they really want it, but does offer some limited security.  Better than nothing and better than some of the other coupler locks out there.
B004BCJBKS|5|Great lights. Great value. Fit perfectly
B0031I4P3Q|5|nice
B00JW1VXTA|4|Nice for the money
B00IMMF7ME|5|does just what it's supposed to do
B00MGV0E8E|5|I was skeptical about the in channel style but they were an easy install, great fit, looks great, and best of all the wife loves them. A+
B000B90LZE|5|Thank You
B000CONUJM|4|Tired of the electronic ones with drained battery or bad readings.  Back to old school and this works fine at a reasonable cost.
B0009N4F8Q|5|Very happy with purchase
B004TBQXQG|5|We love this product... it is nice to have the window cracked when it is raining and not get wet.
B002R12HZG|5|Arrived on time, actually before due date. Took less than two minutes to install, fits perfectly and works well.
B001L9KI56|5|Reduces hand numbness and fatigue!!
B0083G3AXC|2|difficult to get on the chair . once it's on if anyone bumps it, it falls off.
B00TWLIXU2|5|Very good
B00579XP7O|1|Only received bracket NOT the brush with the bolt. Delayed work by 2 days. I will Buy local. Pay 10% extra but save time.
B002IX4M42|2|Cute cover but the reason I'm giving a lower rate is because the image product show 3 lady skull but it's only 2. Other than that, I liked it even though it smell weird at first.
B00RZ4YTCO|5|I like it
B008YFTJTG|5|Great slim design easy to install
B005J94L0C|5|Great quality & it fits perfect'
B00MAG6RMM|4|Great price for a white LED light.  Not the brightest but sufficient.
B008M7IIIY|1|Not happy, that don't look that cool on and it's a pain in the rear if you need to air up or down. You have to get out the little wrench and loosen the locks. They were on my WRX for about 2 hours. Not a good purchase.
B000ZRW78Q|1|I gave one star because it was delivered to me but both are not working and the other from genssi were better even for the quality
B00WCLL6CG|3|Installation was straight-forward.  It took me about 5 hours by myself (including the removal of the original flares) to install.  The instructions were good and all the required hardware was present.  Now that the flares are on, they look very nice.  I parked next to another Wrangler with Bushwackers today, and these look much better (texture and design).  They also do a good job of covering my 35x12.5 Mickey Thompsons and keeping the mud off my paint.<br /><br />Only problem is that the passenger side rear fender came with some pretty deep gashes.  It was the last one I installed, so I didn't see the defects until the very end.  If I had installed it first, then I would have sent them back for a replacement.  The box was undamaged, so I assume it was damaged before shipping.  I hate seeing the defects, and it may influence my decision to purchase an E-Autogrilles bumper in the future.  I'll update my review as I spend more time with the flares.
B00ELJ526S|5|Fantastic stickers. I LOVE it on his black hard hat. Very nice and will last a long time. Got it early!
B00B2PZF7U|4|Wish the mats covered a little more area but still a great product.
B00MFIOP24|5|it worked!
B000CQOIVO|5|a little lose but good
B00JIEX722|5|Very bright as described.<br />Thanks.
B00KLCI91Y|5|Thanxs guys
B00RGZWIW0|4|It slides around a bit though.  I wish it had some Velcro or non-skid bottom pieces.
B00061SMOE|2|Im a Journeyman Iron Worker and The tapered end is cut short of a typical connector bar and so has a nub the size of a typical little finger so it doesnt work well with holes that are way off and 3/4 or 5/8 holes. I couldn't make it to the store near me so I took a chance. I will replace it with a real sleiverbar when i get the chance.
B001KO5JVU|1|Its small, easy to carry and easy to lock. Unfortunately its easy to remove. My XR was stolen last night in SF with this on it. They didt cut it, they just picked the lock quite easy.<br /><br />CAREFUL with this one!
B007O1WWTA|5|This LED lights work perfectly... strongly recommended
B00DP5JIKA|5|easy to use, nice big letters/numbers
B007ISGOPC|5|Great filter for Gravely HD!  Pays for its self after second time cleaning and recharging over a brand name filter.
B00306YESK|5|A very good work glove.
B00QHA3356|5|Very Well Made with enough 2-SIDED Adhesives to cover back of ENTIRE mirror! Only  give up Night View feature of mirror.
B00KQH1DL2|1|I installed them the day I got them, they felt cheap, all tangled up, and they wouldn't stay stuck, and one completely broke that day but decided to tape it, and make it work some how. On the third day the plug itself self destructed and is now in the trash. Take my advice spend more money on better products that will actually last..
B0015S9SWW|3|I needed a unit that would read low current draw. Most of the work I do is industrial repair on highly automated PLC controlled machinery. I need something that can measure the low currents that digital control circuits use in modern equipment. I have only used this a few times so far and it works as I expected .... but. The low range (10mV/A) range will not zero. The minimum setting I can zero it to is 3.1 to 3.6 mv. If you make a measurement and deduct the 3.3 mv zero from the reading is is accurate. The device was not expensive so I can tolerate this. It works well (and correctly) on the course range (1mV/A). Note: I am using this with a Fluke 117 meter.
B0002F66GA|1|Have had the tire cover on the trailer a couple of weeks and it split on the bottom seam already.
B000CQDRTI|4|It's hard to insert a fuse and tap together, but the product works as advertised.  The maximum current (according to the specs on the package) is 10 amps.
B006WPQNB2|4|We purchased this mostly for weekend camping trips along with a popup &#34;toilet&#34; tent. It came with a small bottle of eco deodorizer. We also ordered the blue deodorizer packets because some other reviewers preferred them over the liquid. Overall it is sturdy and appears to be well made although I do question the durability of the seat and lid. The toilet roll holder also seems like an afterthought. It does feels much like a plastic version of your average toilet. The instructions aren't very helpful but operation is pretty straight forward.<br /><br />We have taken it with us on two weekend camping trips so far. I decided to use the liquid deodorizer that came with the toilet because I assumed it's the recommended deodorizer. I did bring one of the other blue deodorizer packets as backup. The toilet flushed clean even on slightly uneven ground. I did place some small rocks under some low spots to level it out. You need to remember to release the pressure from black water tank before adding any liquid to the bowl. I'm not sure if the pressure is caused by the digesting deodorizer or because of the heat we camped in (maybe both) but we did encounter a &#34;blow back&#34; one time.<br /><br />It was our primary toilet for the weekend trips and we used less than half the capacity available each time. It fits perfectly inside a popup &#34;toilet&#34; tent for privacy and additional odor control if you don't have space elsewhere.  Oder was contained to the lower tank and the deodorizer keeps things smelling surprisingly fresh in the tent the entire time. Our campground had a dump station which made disposal easy. I do wish the toilet came with some sort of hose which would help make dumping the black water tank a bit easier in some cases.<br /><br />I do have some long term durability concerns but with proper care and limited use I expect it to last several years. I'd give it a higher rating if the pressure buildup issue could be resolved. I also wish it had a non-electric backup flushing mechanism and a better users manual. Overall we are very happy with our purchase.<br /><br />I have been asked many times how to use it so for those who are unsure here's some basic instructions.<br /><br />Start by opening and closing the lever on the side to release any pressure in bottom tank<br />Lift lid<br /><br />- For Solid Waste<br />Fill bowl with with a couple of flushes of water<br />When done open the side lever completely to deposit the contents into the bottom tank<br />Flush with fresh water until all debris is rinsed into bottom tank<br />Make sure all water is done draining from the bowl and close the side lever<br /><br />- For Liquid Waste<br /><br />Open side lever<br />When done flush tank with fresh water<br />Make sure all water is done draining from the bowl and close the side lever<br /><br />You can also treat liquid waste the same as solid waste but splashing can occur.
B000XY19E4|5|..........great car clock
B00ESN7VVG|4|I love this tool. Used to be a pro mechanic years ago & always wanted a &#34;Vacula&#34; but they were too $$$$. Suction is decent...could be better, but it's acceptable. Perfect for a home/shadetree mechanic with an air compressor.
B000E4LW4K|5|All O K NO SURPRISES. THANKS IS INSTALLED AND WORKING.  THANKS
B0065UJA9G|5|Perfect seal.
B001448Z9Y|4|fits great and sealed
B00Q7QY2YG|5|its even better in person. And easier shifting with the longer leverage. And it was the most simple install.
B001B7TT1M|5|Swings out smoothly fits in that dead space and is waterproof & locks.But locks are only for the honest!
B005SUXDDS|5|Good product and good shipping. It works very good

B000NWA8HU|5|YAYYYYYYYY  My interior lights shut off and on again.  Perfect fit, easy install. THANK YOU!  Saved me a bundle by not having to go through GM. Got it on time.
B00HUGND6K|5|I haven't actually applied it to my car yet. But I love it and it looks perfect. I just keep forgetting to put it on my car after I wash it :)
B004PC5DHE|5|Great product
B00BF0BGXO|1|It's garbage it is not water proof water gets inside the H, also if you have civic(2009 EX) with the tiny spoiler like mine IT DOES NOT FIT I took the spoiler off to put it on but pointlessly because it's made of really cheap plastic and it broke only a few days after it being on.
B00CM589B8|5|Very Nice
B00GGQM4W4|5|Vendor quickly dealt with issue a product overall great experience. Parts work great. Would buy from them again.
B00GG0J9FU|5|Thanks for the article came in good condition.<br />Sorry for the delay in responding
B001UOYNK8|5|USED IN THE CAR!  WORKED GREAT.
B00700U44A|3|Works as it should, but it came very scratched up and covered with stickers, making it ugly and old looking. I used it to tow a beetle from Chicago to south Florida with no incidents.
B00RD982MO|5|Amazing odors  control in the car .Last over a month .I am not sure if it can work in large place.
B0023V9NZW|5|It's ok
B008CE0R5E|5|Compact size but large enough for RV tires.
B00JN0U4SQ|5|Had to modify my antenna base to make it look flush and clean the way I wanted. Very happy with the performance of this little antenna.
B0006Q7H36|5|Best stuff to use
B00WKPFOS6|2|Didn't fit, and haven't gotten a refund after sending it back!
B00IABENQ8|5|Thanks, fits fine.
B001CA9C9C|5|Ford factory part perfect fit and function.
B00WCMD5EM|5|Very wide fit.very High on fenders looks great
B00A82L92I|2|Wrong terminals for Generac generators.  You will have to do some work to get it to fit.
B000C2GG3G|5|Not only did I get it early and for half the price compared to O Rileys outo parts but it also got the job done
B000NJ97C0|5|Purchased for our 5th wheel and they are nice!  It not only stays on the rod, but it also hangs tighter to the rod so the clothes aren't wadded up at bottom.  Our closet seems slim and hangers hang at an angle.  However, they do not fall off in transit.
B00CS7T0IQ|5|I put the on my 2015 RZR  1000xp4.  The fit great and seem to be good quality. Easy to install and provide a great view of what's going on behind me.
B004HDY8XQ|5|No sounds coming when use the brakes just stops the truck
B00A0XTT18|5|Great quality, arrived on time. These work great on my 89 Caravan. I've upgraded these with mountable ratchet straps for my ladders. Only thing I recommend is too wrap the small diameter pole with electrical tape before sliding it into the other to prevent rattle.
B000P17NXQ|1|I like how it operates when it does work. I am now on my third P3 in less than a year, same problem each time, up -down buttons stick. When they stick its almost impossible to get the setting you want, drives me crazy. Lucky it comes with a lifetime warranty, Tekonsha has been great to get me out a replacement real fast. Now my third one is doing the same old crap, the rep told me they have had problems and are changing the design from buttons to a wheel but that hasn't happened yet.
B0020C9OF8|5|Must be great, someone stole off of car. Glad I bought two. I always would remove when leaving the vehicle, in this case I wasn't in the vehicle when it was parked and they were left on (3). This one got stolen.
B00HRCDYG6|4|everything was good
B00PZ6VHWE|5|Perfect fit, good quality
B008HZKQFY|5|After looking at the You Tube video, nstall was a breeze with the stabilizing springs already installed on the brakes. I notice a much lower noise level than my previous OEM part.
B00A9ODAZ4|5|Easy to install,  did it by myself.  Looks good.  Only fault slow shipping
B004W0QISM|5|It really works well. Elevated my arm just enough to make holding the steering wheel comfortable. The armrest in my G37S infiniti is just too low for my body type and the fact that my seat is raised to the max . If the seat was lower and I were taller it might have worked even better but it's very good. Easy to attach with the Velcro and comes with two in the pack.
B00VIICP4M|5|I'm very happy with this organizer.  I like to keep everything in my car neat and tidy and the gray color was perfect because my interior is gray leather.
B00PTYB9QQ|5|Fit great price was right
B00YK5NHRO|5|excellent fit on my son's 2009 DS90x
B00HAXUL0O|4|Did the job well for what it was intended. Good solid connection points and a tight fit around the cord of a good seal to keep the elements out. In fact, tight enough that I used just a little WD-40 on the cord so I didn't have to fight the 10-4 wire through the opening. Made the job a little easier.
B00NO0F1MU|5|beautiful fit
B00JA392P2|3|These wipers are supposed to replace the Super Sporza Silicone blades.  I could immediately tell that these are not nearly as good.  Bummed!
B008VIBDPE|5|Very clear vision day or night!
B004C65DYQ|5|Works great!
B007G7ZCPS|5|After looking at the You Tube video, install was a breeze. Great fIt.  I used this with Bosch BP1252 QuietCast Premium Disc Brake Pad Set.<br /><br />Total cost for disc rotor and brake just under $65.00. tire-shop wanted to charge $400.00. I saved $335.00 !!
B001GJ3E2K|3|Too big
B000WK4EC8|5|Good cleaner. Used this for years and totally satisfied.
B00DGVX3YK|5|Perfect for my Nissan Altima. They don't make noise and work perfect for all seasons.
B009OPYT0O|5|great product very sturdy and great service, easy to put on the car also
B00FOXCI76|5|It is a very inexpensive tool that gets the job done.  I give it an A.
B000JFHMRU|5|Works great, purchased as a replacement.
B004ZF39T0|5|Great product brightest hid kit I bought so far and I am very pleased with this kit I will be buying again. Nice box it comes in too.
B004ZG65S6|5|This shift peg extender did exactly what was needed to fix my combination of short fat legs and a fat gas tank...
B009IHNRJC|5|good job
B001TK7CYM|2|returned these.  they were teeny.
B004AINV1S|5|This is a great part and was easy to install my Saturn Vue.
B0043YIFGU|1|Two person operation. Not efficient. Works great if you want to siphon air.....
B000V55OY6|5|Fit perfectly on my 2003 ford focus.
B00M9K3HYU|5|My mother-in-law is currently teaching two of her adult children how to drive.  One of them is getting his license for the first time at age 27 and the other had let his expire and has to retest at age 34.  I wouldn't be the wonderful sister-in-law that I am if I didn't get these for the occasion.  My mother-in-law absolutely loves them!! My brothers...not so much.  Because they are magnetic they will not damage her new car.  I can't saw the same for the new drivers!!  They are also a decent size for maximum embarassment!!  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
B000OAZCMW|4|The pipe fit perfectly but I had to cut 4 slits at both ends of the piping so I could get a proper seal. Make sure you cut the pipe before putting it on. Its sounds so mean now!
B004GFS2C8|5|Excellent price, great kit. I recommend these to everyone.  Rock chips seem to happen quite frequently and theres always a friend or colleague that could benefit from a kit like this.  I personally have repaired 6 windshields and i've never had the chip grow to a crack.<br /><br />Highly recommended! Buy several of them :)
B00NXRY5GW|5|excelente
B003PJE4ZA|5|easy to install and looks great
B008FSQ13O|4|Pricey for what it is. But I like the blacked-out look.
B002N3TSUK|5|The product works well and was easy to install.  The customer service is awesome.  The rep gave me a call on Saturday to ask what color racks I wanted and answered some of my questions.
B0054DWS1W|5|wouldnt use anything else
B00249GW9S|4|Good Battery.
B000EDOT8C|3|The information says this stove topper will be secure, however it will fly off the stove if you encounter a bumpy road with your RV. So you have to stow it when you travel, which could be a problem with this large item. It does fit the stove and will work as a cutting board.
B00RZHEFSO|5|Absolutely amazing!!!  It's awesome when something works as well as they say it does and it sure does !!!
B00200EFJA|5|This works exactly like it should. Look around at local stores you'll probably find it cheaper.
B00AV9EBIM|5|Good quality and fast shipments.
B00N160W1M|5|Loved it
B006GLA8TA|5|Not sure why these dont come from the factory but they are easy to install. Make sure you put them on where you want them. There is no taking them off easily. They are great.
B00IKL1Y3S|5|HOWEVER i DO NEED SOME WITHOUT THE GAP
B00T9XZ45A|5|High quality TRW part. Perfect fit in our 2007 Volvo XC90 and the price was right. Would definitely buy again.
B000FPYF7E|5|Just what I needed.
B00QJFB2YI|5|excellent
B00J06MCE2|5|strong welds, great price!  Mounted a spare on my boat trailer in under a half hour.
B000C1Q6EG|5|Great pads! Quiet , easy to install, good braking feeling, less dust, I would like to recommend them to all Acura Rsx cars
B00SZMHT8G|5|Can't beat this value. Aluminum valve caps look and feel way better than plastic ones. Excellent color choices as well. Certain cars like my 2012 Buick Regal GS have extra long caps, so these don't completely cover that car. Works perfectly on my motorcycle and wife's car though.
B00367ILMI|5|Arrived today - nice looking item!
B000YM6TX6|4|Good car cover against dust
B005JJ2UAK|5|All perfect
B00CXBKS6A|5|perfect part fast shipping
B002R12HZG|5|Great Item - Fast Shipping - Will Purchase Again
B005U80UQ6|3|Well constructed and apparently high quality. However, a bigger detent needs to be engineered to keep the pegs in folded position.
B0022ZEKCU|4|Cleans and protects
B006N98BRG|5|Great product heavy duty shiping was fast . Super easy install,about half an hour and done.shipping was fast one day! Made a big difference in the handling
B009DJLW92|5|works great they actually sent bulbs with it witch suprised me so for the price its exactly what you need to buy.
B001U3RDHE|3|The tank seems to work as it is supposed to. I was disappointed to see a lot of the finish on top of the tank was not there and the bracket in the middle of the tank that is used to bolt it down was welded on  on an angle and did not touch the floor of the bed of the truck. It took a lot of shimming to bolt it down to the floor without damaging the tank.
B0002NIKFC|5|Perfect t. Exactly as I expected. Looks great in my 19i0 corvette
B006R7PHI0|5|Love the rug. It's a beautiful addition to our campsite and helps prevent tracking of dirt and gravel into the camper.
B00BJ5W4M2|3|These were okay.  I wouldn't buy again though.
B001DR9Z14|5|Im very happy whit the service you provie and the product. I'm glad you like my opinion.I consider myself a professional retail sales man.it took me years.hard work and dedication to become one
B00AHJPQZS|5|This was installed this morning. They perform very well. Just as I remember from the days of old.
B00B1SQBMG|5|The cap arrived quickly and fit my car like it was the factory original.  Solved the issue of my check engine light too.
B001DCF0XQ|5|Fit like a glove!  Was exactly the right cap for my 2007 Mazda 3
B000EBKG90|3|OK, so I wasn't sure what the black edges were, thought maybe it was some sort of integral cover, but no, it's where they decided to use black fabric instead of silver.  I guess this is for people who don't want to completely reflect all the heat their car is receiving, and absorb some of it instead.  Or maybe they just want their sunshade to look really cool ...<br /><br />The wire rim also is a little less supportive than the one I've been using for years.  So, I guess it'll do the job, but there's got to be something better out there.  I'll return this and keep looking.
B00HS5DRG4|5|Great for my 2015 Highlander & much cheaper than buying through the dealership.
B0026N6TMM|3|Amazon said this would fit my 1998 Jeep Cherokee Limited with the 4.0 straight six engine.  It did fit, but the cable was 3&#34; shorter than the original.  The connector is supposed to attach to a bracket on the intake manifold but because the cable is shorter I couldn't attach it; the connector is just hanging there.  Not exactly hanging, the cable from the harness & the cable to the sensor is fairly tight.  There is no slack.<br /><br />The photo shows the bracket that the connector is supposed to be attached to.  With the shorter cable even with the bracket loosened there is no way that the connector can be attached to the bracket.<br /><br />It fixed the problem but I'm not sure how long this will last with no slack in the cable.  If I have to replace it I'll make sure the new sensor has a longer cable so it can be installed and the connector attached to the bracket.
B00HHGSC0A|1|It says front some places then says rear other places pictures are of front so do not buy this. It stinks. who knows you might want the back and get the front. seller charges 15% restocking fee plus you got to pay return shipping. This comes out as a big loss till i have a rear bearing go i guess i will need it someday this is probably the last time i buy any auto parts on amazon.<br />Do not buy from - Detroit Axle<br />(Brand New Front Wheel Hub and Bearing Assembly..) is what it had for discretion..<br />Detroit Axle
B00960NMGY|5|great pipes
B003FPF22I|1|They barely lasted a month then they blew out. Now I can't return them or exchange them cuz they said my 30 days are over. Very disappointed considering that im always buying from Amazon.
B00XBUQPU0|1|Mine may be defective, and it just shows the ceiling in the dimmer position.
B00EF1EW6S|4|Got the flaps. Installation was easy to a point. I had to remove the rear tire to get the screws out. But they look good, fit good. Edit: I did end up drilling the rear flaps. I just felt better with them that way. Nothing against the adhesive. Just put a automotive silicone on the screw to seal the hole and hold the screw in place. Still look good on the truck.
B0054RW1HE|1|The mounting hardware that came with this was wrong. I contacted Rugged Ridge. They said they couldn't help due to &#34;contractual&#34; agreements. Pretty lame answer since it's your name on the box. They apparently can't guarantee that you actually get what you're supposed to get. I will not buy another Rugged Ridge product. I ended up buying the Smittybilt version of these mirrors. I contacted their support and asked what they would do if I was missing parts are received the incorrect parts. They said they'd send me the parts I needed. Give Smittybilt your business.
B000PAM9KO|1|Erroneously says it fits and Acura MDX...it does not.
B005QIC9VO|5|Perfect fitment...same sizing as HJC. The quality is superior to Hawk and other of brands. I was a bit skeptical about GLX, but decided to take chance...definitely glad I did. Materials and workmanship matches that of Arai and Shoei. The wind noise at freeway speed is similar to what I have experienced with other full face helmets. This helmet is solid and well built! Buying another as a backup.
B004EI6A8K|5|works like a charm
B000CQ6FZ6|5|Good solid cover looks great fits well good price good product great price
B00NPPNKTU|3|These lights are great but I got one that said kawell on it and the other did not. Looks funny mounted on the same panel  that's why only three stars
B004Z8F7D8|5|Great price for original Nissan part.
B00B2AFKP2|5|Perfect fit on my 1999 Jeep Cherokee sport 4.0L
B004BTBUXC|5|Just what I wanted... Fit my 97 civic lax perfectly
B0039Z1UHA|5|nice
B000N9VF6Q|5|Works like a champ!! Ez install
B002PH0E1Q|5|Great price and after installed there is a noticeable difference between my old coils vs these new ones. Fit perfect on my 07 5.4L F150
B007VIGCJW|1|Stayes tacky to long and is runny dont stay in place will not buy agian.
B00269504E|2|Looks good but headlights are not very bright and don't shine far enough
B003ULZGK0|5|Good jack it had no problem lifting my 5000lb rv trailer for tire rotation and brake check. It went up fast and stayed no problem.
B00FYX204C|3|It's ok
B009AA2HDE|5|Worked perfectly. No issues.
B00KTIWD44|5|Just as it said it would be, fast shipping
B00VNBEJ1G|4|Put these on a 2010 Honda Fit, H4 is what my bulb is. I'm coming from Kensun H4 HID bulbs and In my experience they are about the same just different. The OPT7 is truly plug n play vs the HID wiring to the battery and dealing with ballast. I'll even give the HID some points vs the OPT7 LED, the HID throws the light maybe 10% further than these LEDs. This is just in my situation, Another thing is if you already have HID bulbs removing everything sux. I like the cleaner light and it took 5 minutes to install these after removing my HIDs. If youre coming from halogen lights you can have these on in 5 to 10 minutes.
B0002UNON8|1|Doesn't work
B004P22CWI|4|Very Protective, not the most stylish thing in the world but it gets the job done. sometimes if bumped they will slide down the hinge especially if the Doors aren't on. But while driving on the interstate at high speeds they stay on very well. Recommended if your hinges have been chipped like mine were.
B00B2HV68A|5|These are BRIGHT and work fine.
B000Q8GVPY|5|Excellent. Product,  holds cam and crankshaft on my engine to remove or tongue bolt no problem,
B00069QNAQ|1|It was horrible. Product was old and dried out and after some effort I received a replacement, but it was still an inferior product.
B00GUCJHOM|5|ordered this product as described. very happy.
B00B8X2Q0K|5|just what I wanted
B005OKCKRW|4|Got the front and rear emblem seven months ago. Haven't out either one on the car yet because my husband said that he will have to remove the entire front clip on our Equinox just to install the front emblem. I didn't want the back to be black and not the front so I had him wait to switch. They have sat in our closet since purchase. They do look as pictures and seemed to be good quality though.
B000RN2AHQ|4|I bought this bag for my KLR650 as I had read other reviews and they stated that it fit.  The bag is well made and was just what I was looking for but it was a little larger than I thought it would be but that isn't a problem.  The bag fit fine but like other people who purchased the bag I had reservations about how strong the magnets were.  I put it on and went for a ride, first highway with speeds up to 80mph and then on rough back country roads.  The bag stayed on but it did move around just a little which made me kind of nervous.  I then purchased from a local hardware store at a minimal cost some small round magnets the same size as the ones in the bag (about the size of a nickel).  I put the bag on the bike and placed four of the magnets (two on each side) over the magnets in the front of the bag.  This made the magnets about twice as strong as before and I have no more worries about the bag moving around or blowing off. It is a good purchase and I would do it all over again....
B000KVDF0G|5|fit perfectly
B00KTIUG5C|5|Item was recieved on time and as advertised
B00HFRLP3C|1|Do not waste ur money on this cheap quality
B002VZ6YMU|5|Looks just like the picture states just what I was looking for
B0001KC0T8|5|Bought this as A birthday gift for my son-in-law for his new truck. Hr loved it,
B00TBHXC4E|5|Living in the southern United States, the vinyl in our cars are subjected to high heat and harsh sun for the majority of the year. Armor All is usually the “go to” product for vinyl cleaning and protection, but I figured if this product is mainly for marine applications, it would probably prove strong enough for use in a land vehicle as well.<br /><br />I sprayed the product onto all the vinyl surfaces in both our household’s cars and I was very impressed with the result. Not only did it remove and pick up most dust and particles, it went on very clear and quickly dried to a rich, natural (for vinyl) sheen that looked professionally detailed. In fact, because it is alcohol free and non-streaking, it requires a good amount of wiping and buffing to evenly apply and adequately remove the liquid (which may be a put-off for some), but the result is a very clean dashboard and accessories. That is to say, the extra effort is worth it. I even used it on the vinyl trim of the seats and they came out looking like new. I can’t speak much to the UV protection, but 303 products have a good reputation and are made in the USA, so I’ve no doubt of its potential to achieve its UV protection claims. Regardless of all that, I just really like the look of my vinyl after using this product. Every piece of trim in my car looks great.<br /><br />Honestly, I would not have thought this would make as big a difference in the appearance of my car’s interior as it did. I would use it just for general vinyl cleaning, even if it didn’t offer any added UV protection. With its great cleaning ability, the visible rejuvenation of my vinyl, and the added protection it provides, it would be unfair to give this product less than five stars. So I say, landlubbers with land craft only, be glad and give this product a try. You won’t be sorry that you did.
B0007TR4CQ|5|Great for for scooters as well, to put in a tight space.
B006JXVVPU|5|This product is excellent. Not only does it keep my jeep much cooler, but I think the biggest impact is the noise reduction. At least for me it made a huge difference.
B0027XY6FS|5|fit perfectly
B0049BI6M0|4|great bang for buck
B00RX7UMDI|5|excellent very bright
B002SINBRQ|5|Haven't use yet and hope not too but looks and feels like good quality product.
B00V2XHMBY|5|Good heavy duty product at a great price!
B00H7LPKKU|5|I saw my husband throw other grease guns across the yard while trying to get grease into the lawn tractor fittings, but this product works exactly as expected.  It really gets the grease into the fittings and not anywhere is doesn't belong.  No clean-up, just gets the job done.<br />This is absolutely worth the money and more.<br />If you need a grease gun coupler, get this one.
B003E02MMC|5|Cheap and works.
B004YK4S1O|5|I'm all about adding classy customizations to set my Escalade apart from others, and these tire stem valves is one example of just that. They fit and they shine but if they change in any way, I'll update my review.
B00I3KLZTE|4|Fills in scratches but use sparingly or it will look globbed on
B0006O2S0U|1|Not accurately describe so that I would know it would not work on presta valve stems
B000S6SJGS|4|Works good but could be a little bigger. Maybe it's just my particular Jeep but one of the the anchors pulls the molding it attached to away from the side of the Jeep.
B005F0XAK2|5|this is a great scent. masculine yet fresh. Smells like someone cut down a cedar tree and laid cinnamon sticks on top. haha
B00LEXFMC8|5|Great headlights had to convert my 8 pin to the 6 pin but they look awesome.
B00C1K0S54|5|Works great
B007RW2WUU|5|I like Fram because the fit is always perfect, and it was no exception with this filter. I didn't have to wiggle it or bend it to make it fit. It snapped right in and I was done installing in just seconds.
B00DP5ZKG6|5|Buy this thing, i use it with a superchips programmer in my 2003 dodge durango 4.7 and works perfect. If u haul u should have this in hour vehicle
B000CIT2LS|5|Real Third party Dyno tested with a proven 8 HP gain on the jeep 4.0!
B001EH7GXM|5|very nice, easy installetion
B004SSC4MM|5|I liked it and I need to order more:)
B00JR4D70K|5|as expected
B000KKENBM|5|nice
B000BUTDCA|5|Did they trick!  Great item.
B006M6CXYM|5|Great deal. Worked awesome for my 84 d150
B00480857S|5|Just what I needed it works great.
B00J5KRUHM|3|It's ok, but is very large and  the magnet closure is basically useless. That being said it fits on the center rear floor behind front buckets of my Chevy Equinox and stays put during turns. I actually got it to use in 2012 Grand Caravan, but is was too large to fit between the seats. Measure carefully and allow for full lid to open.
B00GBBC8FW|5|Great product for the price. Would shop this site agsin
B006MDH5J8|5|I purchased the tow hook about a year ago. I have pulled numerous vehicles out of the mud and snow.<br />Like most people say it rattles alittle bit. I wrapped a few layers of tape to tighten the fit up in the receiver.  Well worth the money!
B00GZ054X2|5|great product
B009RC2HVC|5|Awesome. Parts delivered fast and 5 minute repair
B00CAKILAO|5|Great product
B005CNNLRY|5|Very high quality & they fit perfect!! I have a 2013
B008Y2CC5M|3|Not what was shown  in the picture.
B00EB30YHQ|5|Fits perfect!!
B002K6CD2K|4|This is my second purchase. I like this replacement lamp, the bluish color is cool.<br />From my first purchase 2years ago, I got one of my lamp started to turn-off after 10min on. I think it is still reasonable after 2years usage. That's why I re-purchased the same.
B00K3GBRQ2|4|So far so good.  Much brighter back up lights.
B004NJNKFG|1|It is not working & I will return it back.
B00LNIPAIU|5|love seat covers fit like they suppose to I put them in a hour
B00DHID4DW|2|Mine also faded to an orangey copper color. Not a horrible look, but not what I ordered.
B002XLHUQG|5|Great product.  Fore and aft trailer movement disappeared when the pair was installed.  Installation was quick and simple.
B008B5X5GC|4|Great value, easy installation fixed my surburban
B007V2DM8W|4|It fits in my 2015 lincoln navigator. Its quite heavy and very hard like a plywood.
B00KWLLFLK|5|Thx
B00G0P0ER8|5|Took some elbow grease but got this to fit !
B0067UMURS|5|worked as expected
B000KL36XW|5|the best !
B000C16XLC|5|Fit perfectly and worked as it should.
B000TYVWT0|5|Good quality
B000CNHX0A|5|awesome fit-looks sporty and helps keep rain out!  make your car look good with these
B008H0QA5O|4|Have only had for a short period seems to fine light weight easy to install
B001U04NCA|5|Good jumper
B00KTHZ64O|5|It was easy to install, and worth the price!
B00IVP0U4C|5|absolutely excellent.
B00KTIUG5C|5|Saved me some good $$!
B004VUC026|5|Good
B001FCBS4E|5|Super product.  Just got back from 3500 miles in Alaska and Canada without a single nick on tow car on gravel and tuff roads
B009FUF6DM|4|Great cleaning cloth that really does its job. I especially like using it  to clean my laptop and TV.
B000COY5K0|5|great thanks good bit of kit done the job
B000CPNU64|5|Exactly as described. Fit my 01 TJ perfectly. No issues.
B008J151H4|4|Bought this as a gift for my dads F250, who felt that factory horns were sub par. Not as deep as a peterbuilt or fire engine...but they will reach out and get folks attention when they are texting, updating their twatter feed, fakefriendsbook page or taking selfies while driving. Gonna buy one to mount on my kids powerwheels and watch his friends make surprised poop faces.
B001THSTWY|5|Very quick delivery great fit. OE is slightly misleading as they are not MOPAR but they came with careful packaging and ALL the lights! The lights alone are worth $50. Great buy will be buying fog lights next.
B00XLRPNZ6|3|Too small for the car
B001G7O5IO|5|Perfect OEM part! The part numers even match!!! And really fast shipping package was awesome thank you very much!!!
B00MATVMC4|4|everything functions as advertised
B008G1WX3W|5|When I ordered these headlights it told me it would take about a week to get to me but it only took two days! I was very pleased with the lights....easy to install. Also a great price for both pairs!
B00PIVEMD2|5|Good decals
B00032KBFE|5|Great product
B005DJRDEO|5|Very pleased
B007LICSBS|5|Easy to install and protective.
B00LHNVJ4U|5|Love'em
B00493V684|3|ok
B000L9AD2K|5|Great pump, works well for my son whose one car tire gives him trouble.
B00DZ77210|1|Broke into two peices shortly after I put into my truck and I am not a huge guy so weight wasn't a reason.
B007A3HZLW|5|This stuff REALLY WORKS!!!!!!!  I wasnt sure what I was gonna do to get the water spots off of my Jet Ski with and BAM!! this did the trick!!!
B00HYJSKVQ|5|Great product, fits great with polaris lock m ride
B00CFM7CAW|3|It's a good looking kit but good luck putting it on. Probably took me 2 hours. Clean your bike very very good before you do. Takes very little to screw it up.
B00LM55XHM|5|Ordered for friends. He loves this and only this
B001PKLWM4|5|Thank you very much I love it
B010Q6RHJE|5|Great shift knob. So cool and sexy . Fits and looks great on wife's FJ.  Looks Awesome and fit well
B00H91EXF6|4|Perfect replacement for my 08 Silverado. Seeing them made in China didn’t make me happy.
B000GKEYDS|2|If by leather you mean old guy who put on too much cologne in the 70's. Then yes, much like leather.
B010FD8ZJY|5|Very Nice
B00DBERFCI|1|As soon as I put these bulbs in one bulb is blown out. I switched sockets to see if it's just the wiring but it's not. I recived one blown bulb. Contacted them hopefully I can get another bulb .. And they are definitely not bright at all
B004MZP1IU|5|Very good quality and the screw-hiding hardware included is a nice touch.
B0075XR26U|5|the tool works as advertised shipping was very fast. Only issue with tool is I bought it for RC 40 master link clip style.  The tool tips are just a bit too thick to work perfectly. Does still work with finesse. Still I give 5 stars and recommend to have in any techs tool box
B00USTNY9M|3|It says a set thinking it was two and it's only one
B004TCYONO|5|OEM replacement filter for the 2013 Chevy Cruze 1.4L ECO trim. Same exact filter that I took out of the car.
B0011O0YDW|5|Great simple stools. Very sturdy and well made for the price. Yes if you try to sit on the side or lean on them they will move/tip, but if you sit on them like a normal person they are fine.  Some reviewers had the big yellow Torin logo, my chairs did not. Covering is think and cheap pleather and the foam is very cheap, so they will not last forever and may need repadded/covered sooner rather than later.
B005G51DSM|3|Nice but wrong product for my bike
B00KMR3J7M|5|Seems to work great although I never get to see it. Also it is a pia to remove tailgate for installing. Be sure to get some help for that. I wired my backup light right into reverse wire in taillight. I wouldn't use the nothing hardware as it looks kinda junky and I think the 3m alone will probably outlast the leds and eliminate drilling holes in ur truck.
B00BIA2P9A|5|GREAT PRODUCT
B00CJUW3HW|4|Application instructions would have nice.
B004JNCFRU|1|Did NOT fit 2015 F250 even though listed as did fit.  No way to put bolts on.  Very disappointed.  Looks good, just can't install.
B0000AZ7EY|4|Installed without any problems.  Grease does come out around the spring.  You will need the rubber caps if you don't want grease everywhere.
B007QV7Q2Q|5|Good product, fast shipping....
B008BMQYGI|5|Perfect! Product exactly as described. No complaints. Happy with my purchase.
B004TNPU0E|5|Good part, fast delivery, nice price.  Looks like the original.
B008G2XKKQ|5|Great costumer service, good quality at a reasonable price
B007ZUGRVO|5|Good quick service fit great
B012LG24T0|5|This review was done by a busy 32 year old mother of 2 so that it can hopefully help others asses if the product is worthy of their hard earned money.  Item: #1 Best Quality Lebogner Luxury Auto Backseat Organizer  Item Description:  • Attractive Black & White Backseat Organizer • Easy to Use / Install • Universal • Wipes Easily • Various sized pockets  Product Review:  Have you ever gone somewhere and your baby is crying in the backseat because they are bored? Or they dropped their toy or they threw up on themselves? How many times have we had to pull over to search for something to help ease their little souls? How about you’re just an OCD person that prefers things to be neat and tidy. Well Im both. But even thought Im neat and tidy, any items Ive needed for my kids I usually placed in the trunk or threw it in a big bag. Well this little organizer is great for having everything out in the open per say, makes each individual item easily accessible and NEAT. You can take it inside the house, pack it up with stuff and click it easily into place behind your front seats. I really enjoy this item and only wish I could get more!  Small Print: I purchased this item at a discounted price and was asked to give my impartial view on the product. This review is 100% my own and the cost of the product does not reflect my review in any way. I wouldn't give a good review if it wasn't a good product!
B00480BWCI|5|Works as advertised. Slightly cheaper price than you would pay in retail stores.
B000JZYTEO|4|Ended up not using it since the flange on the cat was rusted also. Looks like it should replace the factory fine though.
B00JQL5RCK|5|Love it...My pup likes to put his paws on top of it while looking out the front windshield. Saves the leather console from getting scratched
B009K4H42Y|5|Received all 5 A01s
B008L17JRC|5|Worked great. Highly recommend to make the carrier more visible to other drivers. If someone hits the carrier it will tear up their car but probably not the carrier as it is very solid. It might as well be an extension of your frame.
B00RM327NG|5|Both iPhone 5 and 6 work fine.
B003RW29FW|5|I used it to stop a crack on my rv air conditioner cover.  It was going to be a temporary fix but it worked great.
B000GF1SBO|5|Good quality
B003MD3TKK|1|Not a very high quality valve stem cap.  I would not buy again.
B00HG0EGGQ|1|the coil worked but you will have to drill the hole out.The CDI box did not work at all and is junk...do not buy this item..not worth my time to pay to ship it back! threw it in the trash...repeat,do not buy this CDI box..
B001QW6H1W|5|So far this is great.  I just installed it with no problems.  The fit is great and I look forward to using it for a while.  I did add the tailgate weather stripping.
B00HNKYD0I|3|It works, but the adhesive is kind of bad. It keeps falling off. Covered all 4 door on my 2007 pontiac torrent
B009GO6CYO|4|Easy to install
B001F0GLFW|5|does the job
B000C9JSBG|5|awesome
B0013LDM46|5|2nd purchase says it all.  This is the best way to tie down the front of any motorcycle.  period.
B000K4YVL0|5|awesome
B00YVUJXYE|4|I just applied the decal to the back windshield of my car. Unfortunately, my back windshield is slightly tinted (like most nowadays) and the black decal blends in so you can't really see it. If I had read the description closer, I would have known there was no background to the decal, so I don't fault the seller. I should have requested a different color. But, I will say the quality seems very good. I may try to purchase again in white.
B00EJ5RBPE|5|Nice and bright.  If you want to mount without contacting the body of the light though you'll want to get a couple M10 nuts, as it only comes with 1 per light.
B006NZTZLQ|5|Used it for 2 weeks and forgot it in a car while helping someone troubleshoot their car. Purchased an LX for cheaper price. Feel the LX Does just as good as MX.
B00BD4V99I|5|I'm very happy with my purchase
B000F0X1J2|5|much better than I had expected. Not a fit like a second skin but fit well enough even around the speedo etc that unless your really trying to pick the fit apart it blends in looking like a new dash. Happy with this product as my old dash was sad  AT BEST. From any angle other than straight up you cannot tell it isn't a new dash. Test fit it till it fits as well as you can make it before you glue anything.
B0080KJ6RA|5|I got this for a stupid reason. Back when I was in France in the seventies, it was the law there to have yellow headlights, and this is just a retro touch for the fog-lights on my 2001 Ford Focus ZX3.
B00P9OEZR6|4|Just applied this on my daughters car, she will be going away to school. I sent her off last year after polishing the paint and using Meguiars Ultimate Wax but the car returned in horrible shape. I waxed it again at Christmas Break. She attends school in Indiana where they get just enough snow to make it messy and the car is out in the elements. The Manufacture says it lasts a year because they washed a car 52 time and it still had beading power. So we will see if washing a car once a week ( their math not mine) actually equals a years protection.  Application note: this needs to go on thin. If you put it on thick its almost impossible to rub off. I noticed a few spots that looked like I had not gotten all the polishing compound off the car and thought I had sealed them in with the Paint Protect. I tried spraying detailing cleaner on it and rubbing and that did not work at all. After a week I then decided to wet the area with water and rub hard- that worked. The sealer needs 24 hours to set. If you apply and it rains the directions indicate you will need to start over.
B007G7ZCPS|5|Worked great, easy  to  install.
B00CFALFXY|5|GREAT PRODUCT
B0042L7DZ8|5|Terrific with my Minkota 55 and my too heavy 15ft aluminum boat.  Great power, lasts longer and depletes less and charges more quickly than all past batteries.  The batteries that I have been looking for.<br /><br />Addendum:  6 stars!!<br />The boat sank.  A week later, both batteries were fine and the Minkota worked fine while batteries and motor were still underwater.  While not recommended,  it is an amazing indication of the quality and durability of the batteries and motor.
B001QIUGVI|5|Thanks for the article came in good condition.<br />Sorry for the delay in responding
B00230D6KQ|5|Easy installation, works great!
B00928B2LW|5|awesome!
B0002SRH5G|4|Works as expected
B008MM1WNC|5|Wrong item,  didn't fit truck.
B007CC1Z2G|5|My left tail light blinks twice as fast now and there is an error message on my dash that says the left tail signal bulb is out.  Lights look awesome and were easy to install.  Anyone have a fix?
B000N9OBNA|5|Nice and compact.  I use this brush to clean the pontoons on my pontoon boat and it works perfectly.
B000EDOT8C|5|Works perfectly. Really provides more counter space and looks nice.
B0026JK8FK|5|Used this on my 2011 Accord v6, got rid of any notchy-ness that there was previously while shifting
B005N53C9I|5|I love these seat covers. They are comfortable too.
B00VCETMWA|4|Looks good on the back of my son's Red Dodge Ram
B00OGAEKBK|5|excellent product and dealer.
B0075QXQ5I|5|Cleared the ESA code on my R1200RT and got it working again Plus helped figure out the ABS codes on my buddies K1200LT. Already paid for itself. Great product.
B000GOG3LU|5|Bought over a year ago and still going strong. My boyfriends car now heats up faster than mine does!
B00EZUL6ZY|5|Good quality fits perfectly fine
B00PFPLYD2|1|Burned out the first time I plugged it in. Smells burnt. I put in another led bulb of different design and make and worked fine. Bad Product.
B00TOWQNEC|3|I wouldn't invest in it again.
B001G4Z5J0|5|Excellent buy, easy to assemble
B009PLR77E|2|Cheap plastic, not even a week the metal ring failed and lost a hub cap so now I have 3 doing nothing
B002YK7G9M|1|The add is misleading it shows the whole kit, but it is only the funnel. why not just show the funnel and instead of saying funnel for funnel say this funnel is made to fit in funnel holder not included. they oked the return but i have to pay freight back.
B0055DQ2RC|5|Great deal for some fairly unbreakable locks- they Keyed alike feature is most appreciated.
B00HVVVEYM|5|I'm really impressed.  It fits perfectly inside the ProSeries cargo carrier I also purchased, holds a lot, and keeps luggage, cooler, whatever, dry and clean. Worth the investment.
B00QNYSLO4|4|So let me start by saying this chain and sprocket kit is amazing.  I have had many complements on this chain so far.  It looks good and is very well made.  I will say the only thing I didn't like was it wasn't pre-cut to the standards.  I know chains are universal, but that is why I gave it a 4 star instead of 5.  Also the sprockets are both made with thicker steel.  These aren't flimsy like some sprockets I have seen.  I would recommend this product to anyone that is in the market.
B00B0YI78M|5|I get a lot of compliments on this seat!
B00515NG9G|5|Reasonably priced for iridium spark plugs, and my Corollas check engine light went off.
B00GJ1D5SI|5|Good
B006TNATWQ|5|Perfect fit, timely delivery, easy to install
B000C42RBY|5|Everything work out find, no trouble
B000UUMM6K|2|I don't know if I misread the description or if it was written wrong, the hood does not open for easy access to clean the vent screens.
B00L4NHW7Q|3|I like them but they are impossible to clean. They're decent for the price
B0085IDD0S|5|Perfect 4&#34; Termination Cap for the sewer dump valve. Just what I needed to replace the original on which the locking tab broke. Fits great. Just received and installed it but looks like the quality is good and should last.
B00HNMLQAG|5|I like working on my car and using screwdrivers and other tools to remove panels is a pain and sometimes leads to leaving marks on the trim.  These inexpensive tools are simple and do the job well.
B00842A7F4|5|nice .. works fine.
B00AQL46AI|2|the Sissy bay is not wide enough to bolt it up
B001AWE8XM|2|Missing all fastners
B002QGVW3K|5|works as intended.
B00JQ6HMJQ|3|I wasted a lot of time trying to follow the written installation instructions before realizing that the instructions were not for the product I received - but for an earlier model.  Fortunately the installation, once scoped out, was straight forward (The symmetry of the piece parts was helpful)  and the results are really quite nice.
B003CSL44S|5|Great fit, no reason to spend more on WeatherTech. Does everything it is supposed to.
B009DJUEKA|4|is what said it was and worked great
B00BX7JVDQ|5|Fit great, easy installation
B00069V310|5|Just what I needed, the dealership want to charge me $350.00, I purchased this Mastercool tools set and did it myself.
B00VGL6CWW|5|works as advertised.  No issues yet.
B00LFL83VG|1|Did not fit my altima
B007X8C2W6|5|Awesome
B00HESQ61I|5|Any rv going to use rv park with electric should have one of these. I lost my front ac due to low voltage.
B003Y8JG0U|4|Real nice all new, just the clips for the air box cover you have to recover from your original plastics and they are super tuff to get out without breaking. No headlight
B000S6SO1S|4|nice
B00NAI5PHM|5|These sporty car floor mats really dressed up my Ford C-Max, a hybrid that gets over 40 miles per gallon.
B004E26BPS|5|Fit and works. Can't ask for more than that.
B008YU5REM|5|Sounds great looks awesome
B00XFS3OU2|5|Does the job and looks good. Great for a quick seat change when preparing to ride 2-up with my wife.
B00HAPKY5O|5|Hard to find item was really needed and worked great good product
B002QZWEC4|5|Love this product, works as advertised.<br />Self installed.
B00AZJYDQI|5|Great tool glad I finally found one that works the way they are suppose to I will keep this seller on file
B00192JGY4|5|Just what I expected and am very happy with it.
B00TFDJZHW|5|Exactly as described, arrived exactly when promised, and a great value.  Thank you for making it easy with the match your part option!
B0083QH3UI|4|The key works, but the halves don't stay together like they should.
B007X4S3SW|5|Perfect charger for my RV battery.
B001RAQGXC|3|Okay, so this product works &#34;O.K.&#34;. I had a large scuff and a medium/deep scratch on a glass dining table that I decided to try to buff out with this product-- and just as described, it removed all the scuff, but the scratch was still visible.<br /><br />The product is pretty self explanatory-- just mount the little buffing bit onto your power drill and your'e ready to rock and roll. Sadly, the kit I ordered was missing the felt polishing pads, which was a total bummer because, lets be honest, going through the whole return process because they sent me an incomplete kit would be a giant pain. I decided to use a plain old folded up paper towel beneath the polisher and it worked just fine.<br /><br />Layered:<br /><br />Buffer bit<br />Folded paper towel<br />Creamy polishing solution<br />Glass<br /><br />To get the glass really shiny and thoroughly buff out a scuff or scratch, it will take about 30 minutes-- it's not a quick band-aid, but well worth it for scuffs and minor scratches.<br /><br />I'm giving this product 3 stars for their quality control not including the felt pads, and the inconvenience it caused me in improvising with a paper towel. I mean-- who knows, maybe the scratch would have come out too if I had the correct hardware.
B00H91L68I|4|Fit like it was made for it !
B00BX7BQ9S|5|A
B011QVDXPK|5|I am very satisfied with this purchase, it's great fitting was perfect just a perfect investment
B009S4SZ3S|5|Worked exactly as expected
B003BSB7PU|5|Love the lemon scent!
B001RITO1A|4|Works great
B008S9CHW4|5|Fits great and protects well
B0051D3MP6|5|This thing is great. It not only tenderizes batteries it fully charged my car battery from dead. the battery wasn't even able to be jumped so i plugged this bad boy onto it for a day or two, dropped it back in the car and it started right up. It trickle charges it nice and slow. For the $20 i payed for it Im an extremely happy buyer. I lent it to a couple of friends and they all loved it as well and bought there own. Every garage should have one of these<br /><br /> - If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask! Thank You
B005M2US8U|5|Far out
B00HS1EKEQ|5|Excellent. Worked perfectly. Simple to install.
B0050I0W8M|2|I bought one of these keys sometime back.  It worked great for a while.  But now the signal is too weak.  I changed the battery several times.  I even used the battery from the good fob and no improvement.  I have to touch the body of the vehicle to make the remote work.
B001F0KPPY|5|satisfied
B00BITIFJA|5|Worked good
B000FBSUEM|5|Looks much better than the old one works fine and should last many years VERY FAST SHIPPING
B000P7O5DG|2|It didn't last very long, the cords are very fragile and too much bending and moving causes the wires to show and eventually break off. If you need it as a quick temporary I suppose it will do, but not many places sell these instore. Put a few extra bucks on a better quality device.
B00LLJ6COW|5|Son loves it!
B00I798FIA|4|Slightly larger than stock for my 2012 Outback H-4 but fits.
B007JSGR9Y|5|I have not asked much of it, but it has done everything that I expected very well
B0091OE6K6|4|Wife and I both had problems with seat belt placement in our 2008 Smart. These allowed us to adjust the belts so that then rested lower and not across my neck or her breasts and neck.  Much more comfortable ride now. For the price this is a great solution to our problem.  In fact so good, we ordered this for our other car.
B000BQSKA0|1|The only thing I hate (wasted my money purchasing is really what I mean here) is the spout with the green or yellow ring.  It sticks in the position that you twist it.  I echo as well the other problems found with this spout.  Spills gas if not careful.  I would like the gas spouts that stopped the flow of fuel (when pouring) automatically when you reach the near full level in the lawn mower or whatever.  I have been happy with my old scepter plastic fuel container that have the yellow accordion style.  If you don't overfill, in practice these spouts help with fewer gasoline emissions into the atmosphere because unlike a funnel, the spout is kept inside the fuel container.  A gas soaked funnel is usually kept exposed to the air!  I have 5 of these fuel containers and only one good spout!  Another reviewer caught the eye of the company and was happy when they sent him a spout that works better than this one.  I would update this review should Scepter respond.
B008WG5SLK|5|Camd on time, fit great, and stays on good
B00BTGSID0|3|Okay product.
B00GXRJ01E|5|Love em!!!
B002M1LE50|5|Bam! EXACTLY WHAT WAS MISSING. truck is back and i mean tire smoking back
B00317FGE4|4|Worked out great. I am female and I installed on my bike very easily. Fit perfectly.
B00DZUE05I|5|Worked as designed
B00MGTS1WW|5|it worked great, ran through some rain it it kept thing dry.
B00SQX3KDC|5|Looks really good, a bit of a bitch to install, but totally worth it
B00651CF1U|4|After getting this antenna installed, I do like the way it looks and I like the quality of the product.... it is better than a similar antenna I purchased for another vehicle at a local auto parts store (national chain). I did have to remove some material at its base to get it to clear the vehicle's cut-out in the windshield molding. I found this to be annoying. It took longer than usual to get the product....like 9 days total.... but I'm spoiled by Amazon's speed. Despite the negatives, this is a nice antenna.
B000E49RD8|5|Loved the key chain. Excellent quality
B00G964WKI|5|Nice Lights, very happy with my purchase and the delivery time was excellent
B00CH586VG|5|My cold air intake is working like a champ I enjoy it very much. Thank
B008G2XOUM|5|Great experience will definitely use again. Thanks
B00FLFWGPG|5|Worked like a charm to fix a terrible Gubment motors design.
B003AMSUNO|5|Installed easily. Instructions and pictures could have been a little better.
B00353M2P0|5|Great product.
B005182QVM|1|The bottles arrived and they were filthy with thick layer of dust on them. Also, a few of them appeared to have been used a little with the liquid not being as high in the bottle as the other's. I was disappointed with the condition they arrived in for the money I had paid.
B003A26Q80|5|Turbosmart makes a great product.  Perfect fit to the stock opening.  Superior performance over the stock bpv.  I highly recommend this product to my friends and family.
B00J5SY87O|1|The item received is different than shown in the photo and i dont know  if the quality is also different.
B000CRO4IK|5|Does what it does. And does it well.
B00W5EU3E2|5|This is great. Well made. Not cheap plastic. This is made of metal and very tough. Great product
B003N8SAKS|5|Aok
B009LOO1DS|4|Product was exactly what I ordered and was very easy to install.  Much cheaper than the dealership wanted to replace it, too, thanks!
B00V6F0G84|5|Thank you!
B000SBCHCA|5|Allows use of the scan tool while under the hood.
B00WRLWGCA|5|Placed this on my luggage so that it would be easier to spot at the airport, and it worked great.
B0081OSRQQ|5|I love it!
B001F7EK44|5|Perfect factory replacement for my 09 subaru
B00SHP50QE|5|Nice decal. Not perfectly accurate.  But it would be near impossible considering the amount of islands
B00K9BF1OA|5|Good size & quality!
B00G49DVGG|5|Really made an old car smell great!
B00802GIW4|4|Great product!!  FYI I installed these in a 2006 Toyota 4Runner and lights do not flicker at all.  One thing I wish was that kit came with 3M double-stick tape to go along with the brackets provided...The brackets work nice, but don't have a secure fit and is much easier to install with the tape.
B00IQEIB9O|5|This decal is big enough for showing on vehicle and the design and colors are outstanding. Worth every dime and it was delivered timely as well
B000HS1356|5|Vert satisfied with cover
B00F9RNIPI|5|I bought this because my less expensive cables from Walmart fell apart.  These look nicer, for similar price: UL listing I hope means that even after a decade sitting in the trunk the insulation will not fall off.  The clamps are better than on the cheaper cables: more options for how to grab the battery and ground.  I appreciate a large bag so I can get the cables back into it after use, compared to a tight squeeze bag.  And the extras are nice: a terminal cleaning brush and a pair of gloves.  I bought 20' cables so I do not have to worry about reaching a battery even when the car is in the garage or a tight parking space.
B004DC7RTI|5|I was a little bit worried that they weren't clear and they won't fit inside a Toyota Highlander 2015 and a Honda Civic 2015 (my father's and sister's cars) but I was wrong to be even worry about this product. It does have a bit of a purple tint in it but it's not really noticeable and it's overall clear. It was a perfect fit in both cars! We didn't have to cut them. They were both pleased with my purchase.<br /><br />I'm hoping to possibly get another one soon for my own car.
B002P8R74W|5|Fit like a glove no issues and really easy to install. Plus getting for almost $100 less than some auto parts stores wanted to charge me just icing on the cake
B00DUN9QJK|3|Batteries do not fit in the back, it says use AA but we have trouble fitting them inside
B002EQQ5ZW|5|Worked great with my evac pump kit
B009VLKLDA|1|This doesn't fit my car, as they said it would!!!!!!
B00GDIPNMS|5|Awesome glasses for the price. Plus I am the only dude around wearing these things!
B001DRJ8JS|5|Wrote a review for the other piston on the other side. These worked very well for me. Recommend highly for 1999 Durango.
B003S1RQ2S|5|Replaced the old battery in our FiOS ONT with this battery. This battery is nearly identical to the one it replaced and is much cheaper than getting a replacement battery through Verizon.
B001TA2XIW|4|Good portable ash tray. I was expecting a little smaller and lighter but the size and weight makes sense. Several people have commented on it. It's also invaluable for holding my cigar when on bar or hotel patios.
B00GZKC6EW|5|Motor runs on it
B0066S1RLG|1|Do not purchase. Does not fit vehicle listed. Will not allow return past 30 days.  Make your purchase elsewhere.
B004A6JA2O|1|It did not fit my 2010 Acura TSX and cost $ returning it.
B0000AZ7EY|5|Bearing buddies should be on all your trailers!
B004GE0R5O|5|It what I was looking for
B00KNMKRU8|5|Does what it says it does. No complaints!
B00P1H9LDE|5|Finally a product that has a brush and finish coating in one.  Much easier to use then the old pens.
B00PYD27W2|3|Need a hole for the headrests (etc)?  They're instructions: get a scissors and cut one!<br />They're cheap.  That pretty much says it all.<br />Stitching ripped out when I stretched the bench seat cover a little too vigorously.<br />They'll protect my new seats from my dogs until I find something better and I sure hope I find something better.
B00AM250CO|5|Great price and works as advertised.
B0068C9AFK|5|I have a 96 honda cbr600 f3. Just put this exhaust on in 15 min and sounds amazing.
B004GCPLXE|4|It is smaller than the old mirror but thanks because we can use it!
B00T5DJZ4K|1|Definitely not worth the money. I was disappointed when this arrived, definitely doesnt look all neat like the picture. Its still in my trunk.. I followed the instructions and put it on and it looked so cheap and wrinkly lol dont waste ur time or little money.
B000E2CVI8|5|It's the cleaning power and flow that keeps me ordering K&N again and again.  This fits my 04 CB919 and is even cheaper through amazon than my local AutoZone and O'Rielly's.
B000HM6UO6|1|misleading picture and has no brackets
B001A0J2JO|5|I bought this not for a car or truck but for my jetski and bikes.  I needed something wide angle so I could see behind me when towing a friend with the ski and biking ( and we all now bike rearview mirrors suck) I attached it to my bike with gopro mounts. You def need the gopro wrench to tighten things up and the two middle parts I glued together. I use generic ebay and amazon gopro parts. I'm not looking to pay full price for the name brand. Clamp on, clamp off.
B001JSRYTM|2|Did not fit to the sissy by bar as stated. Waited to long to return stuck with it. Either I will modify the sissy bar or just scrap this part.
B00C1YI2XA|5|Works good! I see people saying they get too hot. I thought they were all most too bright too so I got a $2 12v regulator from radio shack and it solved all the problems! A battery is around 13 volts. See my picture one is at 12 volts and the other is just direct connect to the battery
B008TU6DQI|5|Mounted these to a Tuffy Security Enclosure in a Jeep JKUR, they work great and keep cargo and my fridge held secure!
B000R5IASC|4|It is an easy to use tool. I do not give it five stars due to the short hose. If it had an extra foot it would be more convenient to use.
B000CMJ1RY|4|Great steering wheel for a classic vehicle.
B00B4FN7JQ|5|Fit perfectly
B005JU5VUK|5|Perfect fit and easy installation
B000C11JHU|5|just as described, worked perfectly
B0006JLSNI|5|Works great even at higher pressure, probably beyond what's recommended.
B001CUNFGI|5|worked just like any other r134a..... nice to be able to have it shipped to my door...
B0040CZ03Q|5|The clips broke unexpectedly from the seat back of the passenger seat on my Honda Ridgeline.  These were identical to the stock item and much less expensive.  Worked great.
B00WXBYYR4|5|Awesome. I would do business with this vendor again. Very happy, Fast delivery
B00092893O|4|good
B00FTDJ9FA|5|They work great and are a lot brighter than the oem bulbs that are on the car from the manufacture!
B000GU5IH4|1|I owned this cover for 1 year, and even though the description claims it is for outdoor use in light and mild conditions it was not able to handle 2 months of a Virginia summer which is in no way extreme.  Warranty claim is not hassle free as you have to pay for shipping expenses and it does not cover wear and tear from normal use.
B004DWSV7U|3|Having trouble loosing satelites
B0054HNQ32|4|good handy stuff
B0006305SI|4|Product as described
B00H7LPKKU|3|Well... I had to fiddle with it a bit to get it working but now it is, so far, working very well. If made a little better I could give it 5 stars. Here's the problem .. the lever that compresses the spring so that you can attach it just didn't seem to work right ... coudn't get it all the way down at first so I couldn't get it onto the fitting. I used a pair of pliers to exercise it a bit and then it starting working ok. But then when I put it on the fitting the lever popped off .. took some doing to get the thing off the fitting ... was about to panic!  But I finally got it off ... and then the lever would pop off every time I depressed it ... so I had to do a little bending of things to get it so it would stay on. Now that all of that is resolved ... it is very easy to get on and off the fittings and it seals up tight ... no grease leaking. Very handy.  I got it because I had so much trouble getting the standard connector on and off the fittings for the front wheel bearing on my lawn mower ... which, to me is a pretty tight space... I have no problem getting this thing in there.
B008G4ILOE|5|Great Item - Fast Shipping - Will Purchase Again
B003P65D1W|5|loved the tag frame! just what i wanted. Fast shipping .
B003ZWG4BY|4|Fit perfect but they need to send factory keepers/nuts with it.
B002EW5FWU|4|Works pretty good... melts those bug guts, but still requires scrubbing on the big, baked on splatters.
B000WJ3I1M|1|Nothing fits the cup holder.
B0002KKITG|5|I have used Trim Shine for years and when I used it on our new SlingShot I was not disappointed.
B00ICV9P5A|5|use one in the frount & one in back of the truck nice
B006OSNUZO|5|I had to grow into loving this new helmet.  At first it felt tight, as I ordered a medium for my smaller than big head.  Over a month or so of getting into it it fits better as I have crushed down the generous padding on the sides.  I like that I have a flip up clear screen as well as the &#34;modular&#34; flip up jaw piece.  There is a small vent near the mouth area as well and I have driven in recent 90+ temps without getting too warm.  The paint is a really nice clearcoat shiny finish that would look good on any vehicle.  It is not too heavy and allows fairly easy over the shoulder viewing.  I do wear it over eyeglasses.  One pair fits nicely but a second pair of perscription RayBans which are larger wiggle up and down a bit at times.  I thinkmost regular eyeglasses would fit even with a snug overall fit.
B000KOVJFG|5|Worked fine the pic is a 100 psi but I did receive a 80 psi
B0031BGZ5Y|1|Impossible to install, way too tight.  Then once you get them in and hate the muffled sound it will be impossible to get them out resulting in damage to your pipes.  I wish I skipped them, waste of money...
B00VURK1LK|2|Shipped fast but Not really what I expected it to look like. Doesn't even look like the picture even has something stuck under a letter. And the letters aren't even the same as picture, plate itself is like metal or aluminum sturdy that's good. I thought it would look like a glossy black but it's like a mate black
B00TEDAE28|5|used to condition an old black wallet and it looks like new again! Thrilled with all the uses I will have to bring back the glow that leather has to it: hand bags and shoes, belts, and to detail my car...then also don't forget the rubber seals around your doors, ref. seals and home doors as it brings back softness to your items...giving them lasting effects and extends their life.
B0073ME5X6|3|Hadn't been a year and i have to replace it
B000C9DJBG|5|The part arrived on time. Access is gained through by removing the glove box liner, which is the most time consuming part took appx 20 minutes. The part however, takes about 5 minutes to replace and install.
B002P8P3UC|5|NOTHING LIKE ORDERING THE RIGHT ONE!
B002ERHHO4|5|Works good. It's strong enough to do the job of holding two fully loaded spray guns.
B008WC5CQ0|5|Came in on first estimated day in great shape. Looks great and fit nice
B00BR0Q8XA|5|As advertised. Quite pleased and easy install!
B00CWG1Q80|5|as described. Thanks!
B000F285EG|5|I bought mine back in March 2013, and just lost it on a bad road near Harrison B.C. If you find it, please mail it back :D  It was fine, quality was good, it just vibrated off the horizontally mounted jack because I had removed the restraint, my fault.  Ordering another one today.
B00G8WLX14|5|Exactly what I was looking for.
B003VAWUKE|4|Just the bulbs I need for my trailer.
B000C9QUFI|5|OK
B00026Z3HC|5|Great purchase, and it paid for itself in the first use!
B006GFLI0O|1|This product wont fit my 5 year old.  Worthless.  Complete scam
B000CP86ZE|1|Great Job
B00P1H3XU6|1|I trust the seller will correct the spelling before sending out...Pretty embarrassing...
B005R21SH0|4|It is what I needed
B004Z75I24|5|Best PS fluid for the price.
B001JT5QNW|1|They are weak the wind breaks them the first set broke they sent me another set and the one on the passenger side broke driving down the interstate i do not recommend you buy these
B001N72FES|4|I've downgraded my rating one point, as while I used it for several months without any problems, it apparently fell apart the first time my dad's mechanic tried to operate it.  The one he replaced it with looks very similar, so I think I can discount user error, but as it was reported to me it &#34;fell apart in his hands the first time he tried to connect it&#34;.
B00WWNAFSU|3|This is adorable, however when I put it on the rear of our SUV you cannot see it through the glass, I dont know if this is normal or what?  Maybe it would work better on a window that is not so thick?
B004C443PI|1|they look cheap and the leather is too hard
B006D9WCSK|5|This is an easy install. Follow the directions and make sure you use jack stands if you are not installing this on a car lift. Also be sure to disconnect breather lines and brake lines so you don't put all the weight on them as you lower the axle. The bump stops were the toughest parts to install. A light amount of grease is necessary. I used a bottle jack to push them in just for ease.
B000O0M824|1|Bought for 2001 ford ranger. Lens does not fit although amazon says it will.
B003QUQ7L2|5|This product fits my EzPass well and looks nice on the dash. One tip for anyone who lives in a hot climate like we do... Do not use the nonslip pad that comes with this, it melted easily on my husbands dash.
B006G3W4J0|5|Perfect fit, snapped right in place
B007G2KKRS|5|The blue is not a navy but rather a bright royal blue.  I bought two to use at our 5th wheel camper.  It's nice having two - one for the door and one for wherever you'd like.  We used on the grass for our grandson to play on. We have placed one under the picnic table when on grass.  It is easy to sweep off debris.  Can be hosed off easily and  helps with tracking into the camper and would be great even with a tent.  Folds nicely for transport and storage.
B00UXKQ6RS|5|Just like the photo and description states, real leather that looks and feels good. It's definitely better than OEM.
B001KQ9L94|5|Easy installation.  YouTube video gives you step by step.
B00GSAUHB8|5|I normally do not write reviews. However, this shade is the best thing ever! No only does it keep it almost 10 /15 degrees cooler ( I live in florida) but its a great price I bought 2 more for gifts. I highly recommend this product you have to buy this
B00BQS8MLO|5|Great match for my vehicle. Fits perfectly
B00G4RX9M4|1|Paint was thick, lumpy and had very uneven pigment distribution even after being mixed.  In theory, if it was thinned down enough with urethane reducer, you might be able to apply it in thin enough coats to avoid obvious brush marks and flaws, but it certainly cannot be used as touch-up paint as is. And the brush was an incredibly cheap plastic bristle brush, not the nice detail brush shown in the product photo. This went straight into the trash, not onto my car.
B00KJGPN5W|3|Has issues with sound using this and Sena Smh10. Have heard cracking sound from just turning it on.
B000EQ0J6U|5|Is this limited lifetime? I need to know.
B00CFQCTYC|5|Look great on my bike.
B00QRELG06|5|I use all sorts of rubbers ..... gloves.  Professionally for over 20 years I relied on &#34;rubber gloves&#34; as I came into contact with lots of people with stuff on them only a seasoned coroner could describe in educated terms.  I, being of simple origin, describe the stuff I came into contact with as crap.  Not in the fecal sense of the word, but you know - stuff we touch, smell or taste and then say the word &#34;crap&#34; as in; WTF is this stuff?!?  But you don't say &#34;What is this stuff...&#34; out loud because your survival instinct is whispering in your ear &#34;You don't want to know.&#34;<br /><br />So about these gloves.  It's made from it's nitrile which means nothing to me because I'm not a scientist either.  Could be made from cow udders for all I care.  But since I mentioned cow udders - has anyone tried that yet?  It's got the built in fingers and all.<br /><br />Think about how strong a glove made from a cow's udder would be.  Until they come up with that invention - this is the best we've got.  And it's really good stuff!  I have average dude hands in that I when I buy winter gloves I buy mediums. The large size fits me snug and secure with a nice forming feel. Important with rubbers.<br /><br />And talk about tough and not too bulky!  That's important because sometimes you don't get to see the crap you just touched.  You rely on your tactile senses to determine level of &#34;Ah S*#T&#34; you're gonna feel like at any moment.  Having gloves on that will give you a sensory heads-up is much better than a total shock when you finally see what it is your clutching.<br /><br />I could list off all the specifications but if you are reading this - you can take the time to read the description.  It's accurate and the details do matter.  Ask anyone that's ever said to them selves &#34;What is that crap...&#34;?<br /><br />My Mom would have slept better knowing I wore these when I touched some of those things.  So if you have a son/daughter that works for some cheap jurisdiction that insists the lowest bidder supply is good enough - buy them a case of these for Christmas.  It's like giving them a bullet proof vest, you'll sleep better knowing when they touch that stuff - they don't have to live with whatever it was the rest of their life.or some cheap jurisdiction that insists the lowest bidder supply is good enough - buy them a case of these for Christmas.

B00ECTQTWI|5|help out a lot while driving
B002TMUJPS|4|As described
B006ZGKZ9E|5|These are very durable without giving my car a &#34;working car&#34; look!
B001O03QWE|1|This pump does not fit a 2014 Nissan Altima.  The electric connection is different.
B004UQQVJY|5|If you intend to use a different product or want a completely wax/sealant free surface then use this. Personally I just use the same product when it comes time to wax again and as long as you took good care of the paint I feel it's just better to layer it on top of whatever existing<br />protection you have. If you intend to do a full detail by claying, compound/polish, etc then you don't need this product because the existing wax/sealant will be stripped by all the prep work you will be doing.<br /><br />This product needs to be washed off after you wipe it down. I find it easiest for me to do this right after washing my car, but before claying. Lightly wipe off most of the water that is on your car after the wash, mist on and wipe it off, rinse after you finish, and wipe your car down for the next step.
B00HVHMCXI|5|Added benefit, has all but eliminated false signals
B00029WYVW|5|Excelente!!!
B000H6QWWC|5|Great, strong. like that I don't need the small loop straps to go with them.
B00N3VGPYS|1|I must say this is the worst of the worst.  I know my engine is running 19/1 air/fuel ratio.  At's why I wanted this gauge so I don't have to go to the speed shop to check after each mod. This gauge showed just like the picture of it shows: 14.7.<br />I tell the guy at the speed shop, to which he replied, &#34;Oh I bet I've seen 20 of those AEM air/fuel gauges and not a one was working.&#34;<br />Return the gauge?  Nope!  It's sold by (third party) Giant Parts and Amazon return policy refers me to Giant Parts.  Giant Part return policy refers me back to Amazon's return policy.<br />I will be very careful of anything I order from Amazon from now on.<br />As for the gauge? To the dumpster it goes.  Now that's planet friendly!
B000RXKR6M|5|Needed one of these and this was perfect, def recommend it!
B00RE6KV48|5|My dry leather sofa loved this stuff and is much more supple and soft now
B000C9CCDC|5|Worked great. Good price
B002J7VX4Y|4|Seems to do ok so far! I will update in a few months....
B00CI90SAI|5|Super cute sticker
B0017UBHQS|5|excelente
B005R0INQ6|5|Nice little bucket, good for its intended purpose
B00BCH51ZO|5|I use this only for wheels. Wouldn't recommend you use something for both wheels AND the body of the car... The handle feels nice and sturdy and the bristles are soft enough they won't scratch your rims. For use on wheels it works nice for general cleaning. The smaller areas and cracks are harder to get to with this brush and you will probably be better off using a smaller detail brush. Great brush.
B00BUROANA|5|Fit perfect and working as expected, hope it lasts several years.
B00JSJMUBQ|5|Absolutely perfect for my 2012 Toyota Prius. Get the Small if you're buying for a Prius. It's really hard to find a perfect SMALL steering for my Prius, but this was the perfect solution :).
B00068Y9KI|5|Love it
B001KQ43NI|1|It was going together good until it came to mounting the motor. The original motor was mounted with bolts that screwed into the motor, the new one cam with studs mounted on the motor and didn't come with nuts to mount it so now I have to put the door cover and everything back together and go to the hardware and spend more time and money and find the correct nuts that should have came with it to begin with. Also on the original motor the wire harness connected directly to the motor on this new one it has a long cord harness that it connects to, which I see being a problem with getting stuck in the moving window parts.
B003NE2HBK|5|Very clean
B004I12438|5|This is the right one!
B002R0OI90|5|Perfect fit and easy to install but you have to get new clips.
B00O3QARHS|5|fast shipping looks great
B008YJTHBW|5|Worked with my car perfect.
B000UVCK9S|5|Item was an absolute pain to install. I chose to wire directly to my fuse box. I used a add a circuit on my licence plate light fuse so the lights would turn on whenever I turned on my headlights. I also had to remove some of the console panels in order to move 2 of the lights to the passenger side and still hide the wiring. I used zip ties to hold all the lights in place. In all it took about 2 and a half hours of work but looked amazing when it was done.
B00I8U0AWM|5|taillights  very hard to get on even with heat and 4 hands,  rest went on easily, looks good
B00LZGWLVE|5|Perfect fit on a 2004 325Ci.
B00HJ1VPCA|5|great product
B00QNG7M6A|5|Very bright, not as hot as HID, and no warm up time. Recommend!
B00YW6GM50|1|This thing overheated on me twice in succession in one usage. It only lasted a few minutes before overheating. I was not able to finish drying off my motorcycle with it. I wound up returning this unit to get something better.
B00Y7C6BUK|1|Glass came UNGLUED upon installation.<br />Definitely not suited for a vibrating 1200cc motorcycle...or any motorcycle for that matter<br />Paint also RUBBED off upon installation.
B0009IQXFO|5|Does a great job cleaning my black car.
B00IZNZOYQ|5|No trouble at all
B001VMYBAQ|5|IDLES A WHOLE LOT SMOOTHER NOW WELL WORTH THE PRICE.
B00G34N1WQ|5|Worked fine and met my needs.
B002IKWGV6|5|nice quality
B00SAAW8Y8|5|Works great on the mower.
B004308V7M|3|Received a different mat than ordered. By the time i had noticed, I had already spread it out on the patio, walked on it, and destroyed the box. It's okay, so I'll just keep it.<br /><br />It's made of quality material and worth the price. Just double check you get the one you want before you remove it.
B00G4FR738|5|Color matched as expected, would recommend if needed
B00NLMCSU4|3|This is an indoor car cover
B0034EM93U|4|Works as expected- just arrived on the very last day of the amazon estimate through who I purchased it from- only drawback...
B000BOKO4W|5|This stuff worked great on a 15 year old car. Very shinny after all theses years.
B000OO04MQ|5|Amazing! I am back riding! I have been 3 months now without over heating. And can use my ac... LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!! WILL RECOMMEND TO ANYONE. ....
B000C9GNLE|5|LOOKS JUST LIKE THE FACTORY PART EASY TO INATALL.
B002P8HG0W|5|Easy to install  works well
B000COBL5W|5|Worked great,nice white light. Brighter than stock.
B00ORWBQGY|3|The product quality/cost ratio for this product is good.  That said, the instructions appear to be written by a Chinese first grader and are one step up from useless.  I've installed the unit and the engine cranks but won't start.  Likely my fault since the wiring diagram that I have for the vehicle shows different color codes than those that are actually used on the harness in the car.  If/when I get it working I'd bump it up one star.  If you have to have this professionally installed, the value starts to become questionable in my mind.  Good luck!
B00XDC9EHW|5|Good strap to carry in the 4 wheeler
B00XZ78W3C|1|Pourly made metal on plastic will not work. I put this bar on the rack started tightening it and it never got tight. Because the bolt pulled through the plastic hole.<br /> I am just glad I didn't have anything on the rack and it break.
B001KS86ZM|5|Does the job on the 2002 4runner!  It is used on the driver's side.
B000C9DA6K|5|Just like what u buy in the auto parts store
B002GO784Y|5|Great product! Very sturdy once mounted and pulls very well. Took about 30 minutes to install.<br /><br />*** YOU WILL NEED A 1/2&#34; ALLEN KEY OR HEX BIT TO INSTALL AS THIS IS NOT PROVIDED ***<br /><br />I went to Lowe's and purchased a punch with a 1/2&#34; shaft to install mine. The tool to install this needs to be included.
B0002JN3GC|5|Needed replacement blades for two yr. old Mazda CX-5. Calls for 24&#34;, 18&#34;, and a 14&#34; blade! Got one of each. Well made, easy to install and a good investment in auto safety, better vision, and know they will work in rough weather. Good value!
B0049HKFIM|5|Replacing this solved my<br />&#34;Check Engine&#34; light on.
B0082F5BRW|1|Does not work on softail rocker c
B000FW4LLW|5|Great Deal!
B00EP3PUV2|4|2015 Ram 1500 Crew Cab (149&#34; wheel base) The bars came well packaged and all parts were labeled.  All parts were included, nothing missing and no extras.  The instructions were easy to follow and I had the bars on the truck, finger tight only, in 20 minutes.  Another 15 minutes to level, straighten and tighten everything down.  Super easy, they look great, and for this price it's a great value.  All parts were labeled however my driver and passenger bars had the labels switched.  I was worried after reading other reviews about the bars not fitting but I could see it was off by approx 3 inches and quickly tried the other bar and it fit perfectly. The downside, the bars are made or very thin metal, they're not going to stand up to much abuse.  But if you're a typical on-road driver, they're probably fine.  I've seen other reviews showing how easy they rust and while I just got them I'd have to agree that they will likely rust over time.  I'm going to try to remove the black tread and silicone it back on to keep it water-tight.  Also, they do move a bit when you stand on them. (I'm 245 lbs.)  The bars don't bend and the brackets don't bend, its the mounting point on the truck that is flexible.  I had a 2013 Ram with factory bars and they mount them differently, in a more secure fashion.
B00LFL79RU|5|works perfect
B00KIPSK2M|1|It bolted on OK, but did not shift reliably.  I lubed the shaft on the heel toe shifter but did not help.  I could shift up but not down.  I was also told that installing a heel toe shifter could void the warranty on the transmission.
B004ROOXK8|2|The description says it should fit all valve stems, but these barely fit my 2010 Altima S Sedan's tire valve stems, and don't go all the way on, leaving most of the threading exposed.
B001GN3ESU|5|Hoping to protect the contacts on the trailer which, since it was new has had all the lights working once consecutively!  Tired of cleaning the contacts just to have lights,so this should help.
B0045N0F5I|1|It rotted in about 6 months . POJ
B002UXT3NU|3|great gift package. it's much smaller than i would expect thought.
B001F02NCW|5|Perfect fit. Quality is very high and it looks awesome. Great way to show your patriotism.
B0081ST4V4|5|As advertised.
B00NPIN8FI|5|What a great pair of LED lights these are!!  They were shipped promptly and are performing flawlessly.  I am using them as DRL's in my Goldwing.  I love the light output these lights produce!  I don't know if they are 1200 lumens, but I do know that if I look at them for any length of time... say longer than a couple of seconds...  I see spots for the next 15 minutes!  No kidding!<br /><br />Time will tell as far as how long they last on a motorcycle, but I suspect, based on the build quality, they should last for years!  I will buy from this seller again (actually I just ordered more because I liked them so much) and strongly suggest you consider these LED's if you want to be seen!<br /><br />Way to go JDM ASTAR!!  PS&#62;&#62;&#62; I don't work for them nor am I getting any monetary consideration for this review.  I am simply telling it like it is!
B00PJH7OLC|5|Fit is a little small but a great product. Looks great and keeps me protected.
B001HRHYBS|5|Its an exhaust manifold gasket, opening size isnt too big or too small.  IT SEALS!
B00ARYTBFY|5|Great. .... look forward to doing more business  with you. ..
B00GSAUHB8|3|Great sunshade, but sleeve is starting to rip after 4 uses. Hope the shade itself holds up. It's easy to fold if you've ever had any experience with other wire-folding type things.
B000760FWU|5|as described. Thanks!
B009MAT9C4|4|Works great, but is a bit unweildy when rolled up, for my taste.
B00664STNE|5|nice cover
B001FAK54A|4|This IS the proper part for the Rugged Ridge steering systems, and it IS exactly what I needed.<br /><br />But it IS NOT 7/8&#34; as advertised. (Not just here, but everywhere.) It's 22mm. The same as a Moog ES3096, only this one is right-hand thread.<br /><br />It's not that big a difference in size, 7/8&#34; is about 22.2mm. But the big difference is in thread pitch. Even a fine thread 7/8 is only 14tpi. This part, being metric, is a 1.5mm thread (about 17tpi.)<br /><br />I was hesitant to buy, because I knew I needed metric. Apparently, I know RR's stuff better than their ad man.
