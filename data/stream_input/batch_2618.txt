1616550414|5.0|This book contains everything fans might want to know about the Zelda series, and is part of Nintendo's unveiling of Zelda's timeline showing the proper series succession through Hyrule's history.  Think of this as not only an encyclopedia for Zelda, but much more.  Hyrule Historia must simply be read to truly understand just how excellent this fan package is.  Collector's items of this quality, for a $20 price tag, is a steal!<br /><br />I do not feel like writing a long review, so I will end with this statement.  If you are a fan of Zelda, especially one who has played nearly every title, do yourself a favor and buy this book.
B002RI9S2Y|5.0|this writer is brilliant, the way he narrates the book with the main character keeps you hooked, the mythology is great and very interesting, love fantasy books no matter how old I get

B00B97SNJI|3.0|Not as good as &#34;Nothing is wrong&#34; but an OK followup to a great album. The hits (Angle & Window Seat) are the best of the album
B00D2CYU2W|4.0|Oops! Wrong Movie. Although, the truth be told, This movie bears a certain stylistic similarity to MOMMIE DEAREST.<br /><br />Liberace was a \\"larger-than-life\\" entertainer and, whether you liked his work or not, he was difficult to ignore.<br /><br />The same thing might be said of Joan Crawford, although, I must say, I liked her films far better than I liked anything Liberace ever did. I was a Joan Crawford Fan. I am not a fan of Liberace.<br /><br />Joan was the reason people went to see MOMMIE DEAREST. Nobody gave a damn about Christina Crawford. Few people would even recognize Christina if she were walking along the street. Everybody wanted to see Joan Crawford, warts and all.<br /><br />Liberace is the reason people will want to see BEHIND THE CANDELABRA. Nobody gives a damn about Scott Thorson. I barely remember what Scott looked like from photos in the tabloids. Tall, blond and completely unmemorable.<br /><br />This made Matt Damon's work the less difficult of the two portrayals. There is no memory of a real life person with whom to draw a comparison.<br /><br />Lastly, like MOMMIE DEAREST, we are only getting one side of the story. Scott's side.<br /><br />As I remember, Liberace would become even more famous because of his flamboyant nature than he would be because of his piano playing. In the fifties, he came across as \\"precious and peculiar\\". By the eighties, he had become a Bird of Paradise and a Las Vegas Institution. If you went to Las Vegas, you had to go see Liberace. Everyone knew that Liberace was Gay no matter how much he denied it.<br /><br />In this movie, Liberace is played to perfection by Michael Douglas in what is undoubtedly the finest portrayal of his long career. Douglas deserves to win an Emmy for it. Liberace is portrayed as a Predatory Old Chicken Hawk who buys his way through a succession of lovers young enough to be his grandchildren and gets away with it simply because his money and fame allow him to do so. His main interest in life is himself. Sadly, in real life, that is largely the rule among celebrities, it is not the exception.<br /><br />I know less of Scott Thorson. Reading between the lines, we get a young hustler with little talent for anything else and an unhealthy appetite for illegal drugs.<br /><br />It's not a pretty picture and the sexual interaction between the two men is strong stuff for television. I'm surprised that Douglas and Damon could be persuaded to play these roles as written. The producers must have paid them plenty.<br /><br />The production values are great as are the supporting performances by Dan Akroyd, Scott Bakula, Cheyenne Jackson and Debbie Reynolds. It's s shame Ms. Reynolds hasn't more to do.<br /><br />All in all, it's a fascinating movie but it's not for the kiddies or the squeamish among you.<br /><br />Get a load of that Auburn Speedster used in the movie. Wow!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|so much fun and brain stimulating!!!! can hardly wait for more levels. if you like solving puzzles you will enjoy this game!!
B009R659L8|4.0|Kept me interested the entire book. Great ending that you do not see coming! Easy to read and very fast.
0316228532|5.0|Characters welldrawn.  Rowlands is a masterstoryteller and thisbook is probably thebeginning of her &#34;adult&#34; career. The ending is alittle unexpected.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game not too hard  not too easy, you  need to use your thinking cap and then it is just right.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|As much as I enjoyed the recent film of Les Miserables, this 25th anniversary performance was even better. Alfie Boe is fabulous as Valjean - And Ramin Karimloo just knocked my socks off as Enjolras. There were strong performances by all, except I think Nick Jonas' voice comes off a little weak, but maybe that's because the others are so powerful.
B003MC5N28|5.0|I am writing a book where everything is set by the government. This book has been a real inspiration! I can't wait to read the rest of the series, and the last book is on my summer reading list.
0486424545|3.0|The novel juxtaposes early 20th c. British humanists and nature lovers--one's a tree hugger--to the nation's imperialists/industrialists who fetishize cars and cash.  Forester argues for the marriage of the two in heavy handed authorial interventions and questionable support for Empire. I'm pulling punches in this rating.  The truth is that I read it groaning this time around, but liked it okay when I read it at 17.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Yes, Just Another Amazing App From Amazon What Else I Need To Say.<br /><br />5 Stars? Why? This Game Is Perfect!!!<br /><br />Lucky, There Are Any More Stars.
0393927938|2.0|The text is identical to the 1st edition and the criticism is equally dated.  If you're buying it for the critical essays, don't waste your money or your students; the first edition is a much better buy
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This app is absolutely good. It is fun and active. This app is so fun and is great for little kids. This is exactly like the show!!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|As with the first season, my wife and I are hooked. This season may even top the first with all the war drama and start of social change. The only things that detracts from the show are studders and stops due to, I assume, buffering. I'm not sure what the problem is with Amazon, but it has never happened watching Netflix. We watched all the first season of Downton Abbey and House of Cards and never had one problem. Go figure.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Love the game and new update please add more updates when you have time<br />Can't wait for the next update but still love the game might recommend for other running games
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I live this book.  I start to read and have to force myself to put it down so I can go to sleep at night,
B007MB5OCE|5.0|What a fun read! A little along the lines of Forest Gump, but with Swedish, Indonesian, German and Russian surnames and an elephant to boot!<br />Oh to have live this much by the time I'm 101.
0061998494|5.0|His voice is in my head when I read his writing.  He is witty and a bit &#34;cussy&#34; but honest and entertaining.  We really enjoyed this book.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|This is so well-done that the characters in the series become the viewers' friends.  It is interesting to learn about the changes that took place in British society as the result of World War One.<br /><br />GJM
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This is a great way to spend your time and knowledge on! This is a good game to spend your day:)
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The characters are still in my mind and hopefully will remain there for a long time to come.  Highly recommend this book.<br /><br />Now I have an ever deeper desire to go visit Afghanistan.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game. Had to share with everyone. Keeps you occupied. It's very addicting and pushes you to keep playing. Hard to put down.
B0097PW7H8|5.0|This app lets me charge my Kindle Fire fine.  The charging from total discharge seems to take a long time, over 2 hours but I don't know that it isn't the norm for a Kindle.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it! if you like a variety you are at the right spot...you will have over 100 games to choose from and as you unlock the games  get better. my kids have this app to keep them entertained.
0525952926|5.0|Just finished this second volume of his trilogy and enjoyed every minute of reading.  Gives the reader a good feel for the WWII era from the common man's perspective.  You follow the second generation of all the families introduced in the first volume through WWII.  Can't wait to see what volume three will bring.
1419702238|3.0|The book was intended as a parting gift for a student, and arrived 3 days after the end of school or almost 3 weeks after I ordered it. Technically, this was still within the period mentioned by the seller but the rate of arrival was still ridiculously long when I consider that I ordered it from a seller that was  closer to me than others.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I fell head over heals in love with this book - the entire series actually!  I didn't want it to end and it was just absolutely perfect!  I had read other reviews where the reader felt the same way, but I wasn't sure about the whole poetry thing.  Let me tell you that was HANDS DOWN one of the BEST parts.  I loved the characters, the story, the surprises, the humor, the angst - it was perfect. I cannot tell you enough how much this book inspired me. Read it. You will love it.
B00785P2QC|5.0|best tycoon style game. great mechanics and fun to play and easy to learn. City escapes are easy to expand and no competition based play makes the player go at his or her own speed. All in all its my favorite game
B00DF0POXA|1.0|I've gotten all of Kanye's albums in the past and never been disappointed until now. The sound quality is horrible and a lot of times he is screaming. He's become so full of himself he's just given up on even trying. I would not recommend this to anyone. I would have given zero stars but Amazon made me choose one
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Great addition to a currently successful ongoing diet. Great ideas and support! Definitely worthwhile to buy this for your success!
B009YN2M7S|5.0|love the story and hated the story to be over with.  I heard so much about this book, and in real life so many play out this real story.
B009AMAGQM|5.0|I saw it in the theater and just had to own it!  It was well done and followed the book very closely.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Love all games from these guys. This is in with the cut the rope. Love it a bunch. Get it.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|The nicest app I have ever used in Android, enable us to write in a document while use kindle fire~
B00632HWOG|5.0|Got this over a year ago, use it daily.  Yeah, you can access your email directly through the web function, but this app displays all your messages without waiting for the site to load on your device.  Used this for my KindleFire, highly recommended.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book and couldn't wait for the third one to arrive, so I canceled the order and ordered it for my tablet! GREAT series!!!
B00BESCJII|5.0|I have always wanted to see this movie. So I got it and watched it and it was a great movie. I loved it. I can also relate to it Alittle. If your a teen and you watch it you can relate Alittle. To sum it up this was a great movie...
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a simple but additive game. I spent an hour having an outstanding time, thanks for the cool game.
1594136440|3.0|Some of the plots were not followed through...such as her having a brother<br />someplace.. never fully developed and left this subject really hanging in air or<br />not carried forth to any extent.  Also, at the end  it was too hard to<br />follow details with too much happening and jumping from one character to<br />another.  Would have enjoyed it more if the story had not tried to bring<br />in so many different characters who did not add to it.  The ending was<br />disappointing, and somewhat unbelieveable.
B00BV2M9LO|3.0|This three star review should be taken as the first 2/3rds of the book rating between 4 and 5 stars, while the final 1/3 rates 2 stars or less. The last third might be among the worst garbage I have ever read.<br /><br />I love Crichton. He introduced me to reading for pleasure when I was 13 years old, and he remains my favorite popular novelist. The scientific and technical bent his work always conveys, combined with fast paced action, work for me in a way that other novelists can barely seem to copy in rough outline on their best days, and this book illustrates that gruesomely. I really wish the publishing company would have just published the raw, unfinished Micro without Preston's \\"help\\".<br /><br />You can tell exactly what he did. Aside from maybe some minor editing work, the first 2/3rds are Crichton. The last third is Preston. In the first 2/3rds, the characters are introduced quickly, their personalities are left mostly up to the imagination of the reader except for the broadest and most relevant strokes, and their roles within the group are laid out. Some people hate this, but I like it. It's normal for Crichton, who spends much more time on drama in the form of action  than drama in the form of personal relationships. He writes like a male: things happen, and the emotions are not extensively force-fed. The high concept is there, probably ludicrous but still intriguing, and the world of insects at quarter inch scale is rendered with a fantastic degree of imagination. I've now decided to invest in a microscope; I want to check out these little buggers for myself (I liked university biology anyway, so that fascination isn't new).<br /><br />You can tell where Preston started really doing the writing or screwing with stuff, and from that point on, the novel is basically ruined. A new character is introduced who has found a way to overcome a problematic side effect of the shrinking; this character is the worst of action-movie super-smart 'n super-tough clichesrolled into one brief appearance and it hurts the book. Speaking of said problematic side effect, there seems to be a move towards explaining why, in a sophisticated fashion, shrinking could only ever be temporary, but the opportunity to make any sophisticated scientific pronouncement - even a ridiculous one - seems lost on Preston. In a related matter, one slimy bastard character specializes in postmodernist thought like Foucault and Derrida (somehow, Nietzsche was not mentioned); this could have set up a whole lot of conversation about perspectivism and power that might have gone somewhere, but Preston tosses it and does nothing with the guy besides kill him in an anti-climactic fashion. The ending is generic and extremely unsatisfying. Potential is squandered everywhere.<br /><br />Then, there's the romance. It's so impossible, given the information we have about these characters from the first 2/3rds, that it might make you audibly groan. The only thing worse is the heavily cliched conversations and little moments the two unlikely lovers have here and there as the bond between them \\"develops\\". So this is what Preston did: no science, no postmodernism, terrible love story. I'm tempted to find Richard Preston and slap him, just once, a cuff, using the back of the hand and leading with the knuckles. And it should be done publicly.<br /><br />I do seriously think that there's someone out there who could have finished this book better than Preston. I'm tempted to do it myself, although I'm obviously not the greatest writer; can't someone get the rights, rewrite it in a Crichton-esque manner, and then re-release this book? It's an insult to a perfectly respectable dead man to screw up his final novel so terribly.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|the game is good it gets you hooked and love how fast is the build time is. it could use better graphics other then that its good.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|This movie will be a classic right there with some of the other high school greats from the 80's!  Too funny.
0307730697|5.0|Best book I have ever read. Great story of an incredible warrior. So sad for his family and friends. Read this book; you won't be disappointed. RIP Adam Brown.
B00C061HZY|5.0|Best album I have heard in forever! First album that I cannot skip a song.  Everyone should buy it, for sure
B00B9LNJ9I|4.0|with panache she glides through these songs; light enough to swirl to, meaningful enough to try to catch a word.<br /><br />she is a true professional with a gilded voice. one of her best, breezy, summery efforts.
B00821OX98|5.0|I am really enjoying this.  It is not at all what I was expecting. Give it a try and you will see.
B00AU15HPC|4.0|I was wondering whatever happened to the Moody Blues lately, since Justin Hayward is such a prolific songwriter--numerous group and solo discs released since 1967. Then I happened upon \\"Spirits of the Western Sky,\\" Hayward's new solo disc. It is good to have him back on my stereo, crooning smooth tunes that range from the Moodies' sound to country pop. Some are covers of already-issued songs, but \\"In Your Blue Eyes,\\" \\"One Day, Someday,\\" \\"On the Road to Love\\" and \\"Western Sky\\" are just a few of the great songs contained on this disc. Dance versions of \\"I Know You're Out There Somewhere\\" are superfluous, unless you really like club music. And the country tunes are lightweight.
193700788X|2.0|This book was a hastily written end of a good series. I think the author couldn't be bothered to come up with anything new and exciting, so she wrote this poor excuse of a story to wrap things up. I wish I hadn't read it
B002SHD9E2|5.0|Being a live on Broadway Phantom Phreak, I had avoided watching this move when it was first released. When Amazon Prime added it to their Free Prime Movies lineup, I decided it was worth a watch... Wow!! The producers and director deserve a standing ovation for this movie musical. The opening scenes and titles are especially thrilling.
B00BMVTS1S|2.0|...stay away from this movie. This has been mangled beyond all recognition from the original story. I was able to enjoy the LOTR trilogy even though I felt far too many liberties were taken with the screenplay. This had my teeth on edge almost from the beginning. The Dwarfs were turned into caricatures, characters and events were created from thin air, plot devices were recycled from LOTR, and all that in the first hour. And there are two more episodes to complete this story that was one third the length of the LOTR trilogy?<br />I should add that I gave it two stars because I don't think the movie is without any entertainment value. People who haven't read The Hobbit might enjoy it, or those who did but weren't attached at all to it the way it was written,  or even if they presented it as, say, \\"The Hobbit, An Unexpectedly Different Journey\\" it could be easier to overlook the glaring discontinuities from the book.<br />What is sad to me is that it was obviously a -correctly- calculated ploy by the producers, who knew that the majority of their target audience would swallow it hook, line and sinker and come back for the second and third installments. I won't be one of them.
B0024Y9EYS|4.0|Picks up after Terminator 2 with Sarah trying to protect John Connor from the cyborgs and trying to find a way to stop D-day from happening.  Summer makes a great cyborg helping Sarah and John defend from the Terminators.  Love Shirley Manson as a Liquid Terminator twist in it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl I read because.... well note the 11,000plus reviews! So many people were reading it... Flynn has a stellar mind and machete wit... but depressing depressing depressing...<br /><br />Her characters aren't noble or inspiring...is this more real? Doubt it... I know a lot of real people who are noble and inspiring... so when a book just leaves me surprised and intrigued and ready to shout BRAVO for the writer's talent...but<br />there's not a character in it that I seriously care about....<br />then the book, the books... are not for me!<br /><br />I find the books(I attempted to read this author's other books as well.) real downers. Lots of social and cultural critique... again, this woman as author reminds me of Dreiser in the 19c and Sinclair Lewis in the 20c....<br /><br />but there is something soul-deadening about these characters.Whatever is good in their lives they seem determined to miss! So I end up not caring about them very much.<br /><br />Brilliant writing... but characters some of the most unsympathetic I've ever read.
B0088W6IMQ|4.0|Great spin off from Stargate SG1.  Love the characters, the plot, and the new aliens involved light years away from their home.  Making due with what they got cause there is not a way home for them. Teaming up with the locals to fight the wraith.

B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Make sure to watch the entire series!<br />I watched them all in a couple of weeks.<br />Can't recommend any higher but beware<br />there is alot of violence!
0451213092|5.0|I like Ken Follett. I have read many of his huge books such as Pillars of the Earth and World Without End. I thought each of those books was fantastic but this one was better than any of them. This is a true, American story of leadership, commitment, loyalty and trust--traits which seem to be missing from many Americans now. But we find all those traits, including the willingness to risk one's life, in this remarkable accounting of a hostage crisis in Iran that the media hardly covered. If you like action, honesty and a great piece of non-fiction, then this is the book for you.  You will love it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game great !! You get missions and there is awesome jet packs, like laser jet pack , and shark head jet pack , there is even one that shoots cash and  coins!<br />There are great gadgets like air Barry's  which make you jump SUPER high. I'd advise<br />you to get this game.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Love David's books.  This is the second Will Robie book that we have read and really like the character.  We also love The Camel Club books.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I got this for my daughter  who loves the MLP sometime ago. When the app first installed you could play it with the wifi turned off, a little trick to keep my daughter from buying stuff with real money. You can no longer do that and must be connected. Also the amount you can spend through the app is significant, 100$ at a time. I suggest avoiding this app entirely.
030758836X|4.0|ENJOYED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE TWO CHARACTERS AND THE TOTALLY UNEXPECTED ENDING!  I AM SHARING THE BOOK WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|This book was a little all over the place. Christians controlling anger gets old really quickly. All in all it was all right. I really only read it because its a series, I wouldn't read it agin nor recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The puzzles are quite good I was stumped on a few. Required a bit more thought than I was expecting. A fun way to eat up an hour in any waiting room.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|can't wait for more rooms to unlock played until I opened them all couldn't put it down. hope there are more soon.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Brain exercise is great.  I really like this one.  Numbers colors and math.  Brain twisted for all.  Common sense is required.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|This book takes you back in time.  Frank McCourt makes you feel like you are there and right along side him as a boy.  Filled with all the emotions a poverty stricken boy must face.  If you enjoy a great autobiography....then this is a must read.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|very fun just wish for more cars and levels.  also wish the physics. were a little more realistic and you could upgrade with roll cage so you don't break neck
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|This app is trash. When I try to record a video the entire app shuts down. Not worth the $.99 I paid for it.
0061438294|5.0|Great book! Realistic about what you can and cant do with reading body language.<br />You are learning to notice changes in body language that should trigger you to think further about the situation and the reason why that person shows that behaviour. One of the better books in my bookcase and have read it several times already and will continue to do so.
0440246318|5.0|I have read every Jack Reacher  that has been printed. Have enjoyed them all and look forward to the next one...Lee Child is a very good author.
B00AATFJK2|5.0|seen it as a kid it very scarey.now it brings back good memories cause i seen it with dad and sister.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I LOVED his first two books.  This one had too many characters.  Some characters were not fully developed.  Many chapters introduced different people and then they were never written about again.  It left me feeling like, &#34;why do I care about these people?&#34;  Those I did care about, the story never wrapped back to them.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|I find that Nicholas sparks brings his characters to life .  I can feel the emotions of his characters.  Thanks for good reading!
B008OOYALE|4.0|this game is great to play and ez. kick back and breed you own dragon's. and watch the money roll in
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|As with all the Angry Birds games this one does not disappoint.  The only things negative it that there are so few levels.  My kids really LOVE Angry Bird space which has ten times the levels and it didn't take them very long to play through all the levels on the Friends version.
0938045768|5.0|I almost didn't buy this book because of the title and chintzy cover, but the numerous positive reviews convinced me and I am glad that I did.<br /><br />This book is about bodybuilding in a functional way by using your body as the weight. The author uses outlines the big six calisthenics and provides a progression for the reader to eventually be able to complete the most difficult variations of bridges, pushups, pullups, squats, leg lifts, and handstand pushups.<br /><br />The best part of this book is the pathway that the author lays out that leads to each of the most difficult exercises. He starts with extremely simple variations and offers gradual and progressively more difficult exercises as you become stronger.<br /><br />The whole prison/convict aspect of the book seems sensational and I could have done without it, but the content is top notch and this book absolutely earned the 5-stars.
B00CL0J99K|1.0|Waste of one of the most powerful Marvel characters, too much comedy, this is a bad movie to start the phase 2 MCU
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is super cute and fun. My little girl likes to help &quot;pet&quot; the fish. I do wish that some of the quests were easier to complete without the use of pearls. But it's still addicting.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This works well. I was able to stay in touch while out of town. That was the reason for downloading Facebook to my Kindle. I like having the option when I'm away from the desktop.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I liked that she kept the true until the end.<br />I would tell may friends about it.<br />This is a Great book!
B007KQ6XYY|2.0|No real challenge. Maybe this would be good for very young children, but not for my seven-year old and nine-year old grandsons. I wasn't interested at all.
B001NESPHC|5.0|If a magician cast a spell on a songbird and turned her to human form, Melody would be that person. This is one of the best albums I've ever heard. Melodies voice quivers, it trembles, and has power, sadness, beauty all at the same time... I could go on. She absolutely kills it on this record! Her other albums are very very good, but where Worrisome heart is a good album and The Absence has great variety with the songs, there is just something magical to me about all of the songs on this album. Where Worrisome heart is much more bluesy to me, and The Absence is more jazzy and sees Melody experimenting with world music, Worrisome heart is a great mix between the two and they seem to fit very well together. Beautiful arrangements and string sections, and great playing by the musicians; instrumentation is also amazing, especially on the trumpet solo on \\"Our Love is Easy\\"; he made that baby cry!<br /><br />This isn't really up for debate, go buy this album right now.
B00AHGSVKS|4.0|I read this book many years ago and was ready for a reread. Clarke is a cerebral writer. Like 2001, this would not make a successful modern movie. It plods. There's little action. This is a thought provoking book, worth at least one read, but I didn't find the ending satisfying.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|loved it. Can't wait to look at the other games by this provider. Really kept my attention. Couldn't put it down.
B0063GORYU|3.0|I enjoy this game on my computer, but not so much on the small screened Kindle. I'll play it when I get tired of Jewels.
B005NFJAXU|5.0|this  was as described which I loved.  I was happy with this purchase no problems and the dvd's were in perfect condition.  Even  came with original box :)
B001U3Y5XE|3.0|Terrific concept. When I described it to my grandsons, they were excited. However, we were all disappointed in the difficulty of the game. We are making up new rules to make it fun. I think the challenge can be worth it.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|this book is a must read.  I have read it twice now.  I love it.  Fantastic price in fantastic condition I would buy from this seller again.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I play all the time. Many levels. A good challenge in the timed mode. I think being able to make the matches quickly is good exercise for the brain. I like having it on the Kindle
B0063IH60K|4.0|Love it! Especially nice for bed when arthritis flares up. I've loved solitaire since I was a kid. This makes it easy to play. No cards to fall off the bed, etc. Thanks for a great product.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I have read these books in hard copy, and I'm going through a reread. Want to be ready for the next movie. Suzanne Collins has written an awesome series for YA. It's about time somebody wrote WELL for kids.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|very fun game wish that it would have been a little longer but o well it was free cant wait for a update to happen
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I got this game for my grandsons, but I play it also. Lots of different challenges and opportunities to improve your spatial skills. The boys are really good at it. I like that THEY taught ME.
B000AYELVA|4.0|X-Men is by far a good starting point for comic book turn into movies.  Looking back this came out when I was a senior in high school,  I wasn't sure what to expect when it came to the action and special effects.  I have to admit I was very pleased with what came of the outcome of the actors, special effects and directing.  I still have to watch the 2nd and 3rd movie of the X-Men trilogy, but this movie gives me lot of hope for when I do watch those movies later on this week.  Plus like most people I bought the movie for Wolverine and I also enjoy Storm.  But the other characters added lot to the mix and made the movie even more enjoyable to watch and added benifit got the movie for five dollars roughly from amazon.  So if your into comic book movies with loads of special effects, great acting by mutiple good actors and a plotline that you can believe then buy this movie if you don't already have it in your DVD collection because it will be worth the money for the movie.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|It wasn't my kind of game, but my grandsons liked it. They figured it out faster than I did. No surprise there. They only stopped playing when I got them minecraft!
B00BSZZA3I|5.0|great case bought for my wife ,maintains the aesthetic of the phone and is practical as a stand to take advantage of screen and music , highly recommend this case
B00992CF6W|5.0|My grandsons love it. I purchased it for them for my Kindle so that they would have something to do while waiting in restaurants and so forth. They truly enjoy it.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|Really good show, wish amazon would put more seasons though. I highly recommend watching it, I would stay up all night watching it.
075669812X|3.0|Since all of the information can be looked up on line I can't see any real advantage to this book other than show and tell with friends at school.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|Gotta love that Lady antebellum...there are very few songs these  guys are not great at singing. Gotta love this one too.
1419700049|3.0|The flavor of the books shows no change with the series as if we are trapped in middle school, I can't think of a more terrifying concept.
B007HO392S|5.0|Cutest little girl in the business and has a voice that will knock your socks off. Also best Idol ever.
B0049VZ222|5.0|wish I had it,didn't put it on dvd till season 2 but watch season 2 and 3 over and over can't get enough
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|GOT to be the coolest female singer in the world. This great cd is the very best of them all.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I don't know who wouldn't love this movie.  Ioan Gruffudd and Benedict Cumberbatch did an amazing job portraying young politicians on a mission!
B00007KWHG|5.0|This is even better than I expected.  It is a very good CD, love everything about it. If you just want to go back & remember some good times with music this is it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I found the author's story and explanation of his NDE very compelling.  Since he was a scientist and non believer to start with, it made his experience all the more realistic and believable to me.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Loved the book great job Emma if this is your 1st book well let me just say you killed me , lol in such a great way Drew story is so good I love reading books that focus on men's love and miss haps torments and most off all their stupid mistakes, but with love and heart in the end. This book did it for me from begging to end I would not put it down it was so funny and amazing , love the money jar, I haves a day care and I will give the ideas to the moms  Totally though it was worth it. Thank you so much for your great mind and funny characters in the book you did it. Keep the work coming looking forward to the next book,
B000FFJYB6|5.0|No complaints.  Movie worked just fine. If you've never seen this film and are hoping to hear a review of the film itself, It's a nice feel good movie that younger teens (and perhaps other aged kids) seem to like a lot.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I love Jodi Picoult- this book had me emotionally gripped, but still felt like it didn't quite resolve in a dramatic fashion like I expected from Picoult. Seemed a bit predictable. Not a bad read though, I enjoyed it on a weekend.
B00C061HZY|5.0|The album is great and showcases a lot of the influences that Daft Punk has had.  I really enjoyed the album art work. Overall, a great buy for a Daft Punk Fan
B0052AC8C6|5.0|we have watched this great movie over and over.  We bought copies for each of my kids to watch in their homes. I strongly  recommend it to all my friends.
B009NY59UU|4.0|The movie, scenic and story-line was great....but I was married to a Vietnam vet and the gruesome pictures were very hurtful as WAR is.  Personally, I would have not chosen to watch the movie had it not been for sharing the experience with my present husband. (He also was in Vietnam as a pilot.)
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Found this book pretty boring for the most part. Too long and drawn out. Just missing something most of his other books have.
0671502484|5.0|Truly a great read, I found it hard to put down, and a must read for anyone wanting to gain understanding and insight to the oil and gas industry
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The difference between the wealthy city folks and the poorer small village people was quite interesting and revealing.  I was taken by surprise by the ending.  Had almost forgotten about the feathers.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|It doesn't work! Picture takes a long time to display and then the objects to find dont come up at all. No directions either.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I've read all three of Hosseini's books.  This is the weakest of the three.  But in all fairness, I was unable to immerse myself in the book and had to read it catch as catch can.  The storyline unfolds through the presentation of multiple characters and how the threads that connect them become braided into a net-like labarynth which both traps and releases simultaneously.  At times it felt disjointed.  While I can't say I loved it, I certainly recommend it to anyone who has read either of Hosseini's prior novels  and loved them.  When he releases his next novel, I will be eager to read it.
B00D6GT5S8|5.0|I am a recent listener of this band via my Icelandic teacher. I will admit am not fond of some of their songs, but is only a small selection of songs. The majority of their songs are very good. I will recommend them to anyone who likes rock with a real alternative beat. Most of their song are rambles Lol but beat is solid as well as the sound. I will continue to listen to them! This album goes a bit harder than last one, which was very mellow in my mind-Valtari, which basically means one of those roller trucks you see along the roads flattening down pavement Lol. Nonthinking and forward movement. Anyway give Kveikur a listen..you will either like or not choice is yours! Be well and listen long
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Even though I had 3 blu ray and the other HP in  DVD, I bought this set so I could be consistant and save room in my DVD/Blu ray collection.  Super fast shipping, great quality.  Love it!
0061950726|5.0|Times and circumstances change but some still have similar experiences as do the characters in this book.  Both are orphans, and both are trying to put purpose and reason to their lives.  Even though one is 91 and the other is 16 they find that they are drawn together and help each other.  This is a wonderful story of a sad historical time in American history and a sad current situation that far to many young people are dealing with; being a orphan, foster care and adoption.  I highly recommend this story.
0307474275|5.0|The main characters are Professor Robert Langdon, a symbologist, and Sophie Neveu, a cryptographer. They have to decipher clues in artwork and architecture that link back to an ancient society protecting the truth about Jesus Christ and unlocking the greatest secret.  The Da Vinci Code is a mystery detective novel written by Dan Brown, combining the detective thriller and conspiracy fiction. The book has provoked a popular interest in speculation concerning the Holy Grail, though The Roman Catholic church criticizes this book because they don`t teach the ideas proposed in this novel.  In summary this book is a gripping mystery detective novel you simply must read...
B000EXZDOQ|5.0|most people don't know that this version of the band was scrapped basically because they weren't considered pretty enuff for MTV ... what a load of crap ... but anyone who hears this knows these guys can play their ASS OFF !!! the best Whitesnake album ever !!!
0345803485|5.0|E L James is an former executive of TV living in London. She is a writer, married with two children. Since she was a child  she dreamed of writing a story which readers love but she postponed this dream to concentrate on her family and her career. Finally she got the balls to write and  put on paper her first romance, Fifty Shades of Grey. In sequence she published another two books of the series , Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed, completing the Trilogy and becoming the author of a best selling series.<br />  I read this trilogy. It`s really a fantastic romance, a unique story that entertained me . The plot revolves around a Literature student who interviews a young man a billionaire named Christian Grey discovering him to be a sensual man, brilliant and deeply dominating. Naive and innocent, Ana is surprised to  note that she desires him with his enigmatic story. She is desperate to attract him . He isn't able to resist her discrete beauty,the humble and the independent spirit of Ana. Christian admits that he desires her, too, but on his terms. In their sensual and passionate relationship, Ana doesn't only discover more about herself but also learns about the obscure secrets that Grey tries to keep  hidden. This story is gripping !!!! On the other hand there are some negative points.  In the first book , the writer uses a lot bad words and even the plot is strong. It's a complex romance, and one that is hard to put down. I have heard that they'll make a film of it. For all lovers of romance books (you know who you are )this is a must read. I hope this trilogy is made into a film .
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|This was one of the slowest, most boring movies I have ever watched.  The movie background was so dark that it was very hard to see.
B005IZNM0W|5.0|Playing with those toys from Cars is great. I prefer offering toys which require the child to use imagination, and betting a Cars race is an amazing activities for children.
B001NLYXOE|4.0|As a high school English teacher I have used Polanski's version of Macbeth several times; however, I wish they had negated the gratuitous nudity.  It's unnecessary and historically inaccurate.<br /><br />Regardless...it provides a fairly good view of life in early Scotland and does a nice job of representing Shakespeare's play.
B000024L5R|5.0|Love this CD. I own three Celine Dion CD's and this is my favorite. Enjoy every song greatly except for maybe two: River Deep and Fly aren't my cup of tea. Still would buy it anyway.
B000002PCS|5.0|Somewhere In Time is a favorite movie and soundtrack for me and my husband.  We often play the soundtrack when we go to bed.  We know the movie and music so well that we often reminisce about which part of the movie the music reflects.<br /><br />I've also used the film and soundtrack in my high school English classes where they analyze the effects of the music on the audience and on how the music enhances the film itself.<br /><br />We've been through 4 copies of the VHS tape, 2 copies of the DVD, and 6 copies of the soundtrack on cassette and CD.<br /><br />I would recommend it to just about anyone who enjoys romance and wonderful music.
B00CKZX0AA|5.0|Felt like the movie. I was flying. I workout to movie score. This will a fav.  Think  u like it
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Really well done. Addictive, but much smarter than the average show. Makes you think. Sometimes makes you laugh. Love the strong but graceful lead female character.
B005EGXTHG|4.0|A good follow on from the first book. Easy to read, with an interesting storyline. Not easy to put down.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|don't download this item.  You will end up uninstalling.  The apps acts like it will show a video but it never loads
B007RCJNDE|5.0|Found that I couldn't put it down. A great book to finish with. Well written and certainly worth waiting for.
B0002YLC24|5.0|In the song, \\"Periodically Double or Triple lead singer of Yo La Tengo, Ira Kaplan, opens with the line, \\"I've never read Proust/Seems a little too long.\\"  In this bit of understatement, Kaplan touches upon the sacrifices of time.  We only have so many years, so we must make certain decisions about what we will and will not do to fill up those years.  It's no coincidence that Proust himself was concerned with the paradoxes of time.  The past, in Proust's work, is always in a dialectic relationship with the present--that is, it never leaves us and it is always filtered through the now.  Of course, I've never actually read Proust.  As Kaplan suggested, it seems pretty long.  I've made the decision that, at least up until now, I don't want to invest my time in Proust.  And yet, at the same time I would genuinely feel sorry for someone who hasn't read The Great Gatsby, Catch-22, The Sound and the Fury, Slaughterhouse Five, Moby Dick, The Sun Also Rises, along with a whole host of other classics before his or her time is up.  So we all must make choices.<br /><br />I bring all of this up because the movie Before Sunset is all about the passage of time and how the choices we make preclude certain avenues in our lives.  Taking place nine years after the events of Before Sunrise, Sunset reunites Jessie and Celine, two young lovers who had spent a single night together in Vienna before vanishing from each others' lives.  Jessie has written a book, the plot of which suspiciously echoes the events of Vienna, and because his press tour takes him through Paris, he has one more chance to walk around a beautiful European city conversing with Celine about life, the universe, and everything.  But this time there's even more of a time constraint.  Jessie has to leave in an hour and a half if he wants to catch his plane.  The choice to limit the amount of time Jessie and Celine spend together and to shoot the film in real time only further stresses the finite nature of the moment andthe importance of the decisions we make.<br /><br />Naturally, nine years have changed Jessie and Celine.  Jessie finds himself in a damaged marriage with a son whom he adores but a wife whom he never really loved.  Celine works in an environmental non-profit, but she has never fully committed to any single relationship over the years.  In many ways these two characters are immensely successful for their age.  Celine might still worry about the state of the world, but she works for a company that makes real changes.  Jessie has published a book that is potentially successful enough to warrant a promotional engagement at Shakespeare and Company.  And yet in their personal life they've found a nearly inexplicable lack.  The question, of course, is if they hadn't parted nine years ago, would they feel this way?<br /><br />At one point, Celine says, \\"Memory is a wonderful thing if you don't have to deal with the past.\\"  There's a sense throughout the film that both Jessie and Celine have romanticized their night together as a means of avoiding their present day problems.  Their night in Vienna has become, in its own peculiar way, preserved in amber, and any relationship since then has to compete with that refraction of a memory.  This dialogue with the past occurs throughout the film, and I myself had a similar situation watching this film.  When first watching it many years ago, I thought the movie was about how people become disillusioned as they get older, but upon multiple viewings since, I now think it's about how questions of what could have been can seem like an escape pod for whatever presses upon us in the now.  Even Celine claims, \\"Maybe we would have hated each other eventually.\\"  Celine and Jessie want the relationship they had nine years ago, but they don't want to necessarily put in the work.  In fact, over the years the characters have become more romantic.  In the first film, they had to fight against their 90s cynicism, but here they are more open to the possibilities that finding the right person can fix what's wrong with their world.<br /><br />The principle characters involved with this film have really done the impossible.  They have made a sequel that is arguably deeper than the original (and I say this as someone who whole heartedly loves the original).  But what's more, Sunset complicates its predecessor.  Hollywood cinema is filled with movies about couples who meet, overcome obstacles and fall deeply in love.  But no one, it seems, wants to engage with the long term consequences of monogamy.  Sunset only touches upon some of these issues (which they will hopefully get to in the third chapter), but it does present us with something that's incredibly rare in American cinema: two likable, engaging people genuinely dealing with growing older and understanding the impact of life's choices.

B001DHXT6G|3.0|I love the original series of Star Trek, but I was very disappointed in the shipping. When this set arrived at my home the cases of seasons one and two were damaged and the episode cards for season two were missing.
1476712042|4.0|I have to admit upfront that I did not like the characters in this book.  That said, the writing, plotting and characterization is top-notch.  The author does a terrific job of portraying two messed up college students trying to grow up and actually failing at it.  Travis is from a loving but violent background and Abby was running away from a dysfunctional parent.  They both need therapy, Travis more than Abby, although the fact that she stays with him may mean she needs therapy more than Travis.  The only characters that lean toward normal are a gay friend, Finch, and Travis' roommate and cousin Shepley.  Even Shepley's girlfriend, America, is a bit over the top in the \\"protective\\" department when it comes to Abby. This is a book to inspire many discussions of physical and psychological abuse.  This might have been a YA book except that it has quite a bit of sex, but even the sex did not read satisfying when the heroine is basically jumped on by her partner. Well done study of college age students with multiple problems and worth the read.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I'm already waiting with anticipation as to what is going to happen next!! I love this couple and how they're fighting against the world together...
B0043UB0BQ|5.0|Spartacus has something for everyone except the easily offended.  And the two Andy Whitfield seasons form one long narrative that is simply some of the best serial TV I have ever seen!  The last season doesn't quite measure up.<br /><br />Do you like complex narratives?  Check.  Well developed, complex characters.  Check again.  Shades of grey, with villains who can be sympathetic and heroes who can be unsympathetic?  Yep!  Nudity galore?  Sexy straight people?  TONS!  Positive gay role models?  Huge yes!  How about crazy violence shown in an artistic, or at least art-directed manner?  It's all here!<br /><br />Batiatus, Spartacus, Lucretia and Illythia really make the series but there are many standout secondary characters as well.  Really can't recommend it enough.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|I can't count how many times I have listened to this 2 CD set. And I will listen to it many more times. First, I love live music. Second, I love the Beach Boys. There music and sound is timeless. I have several of their early albums. Now I am 70 which makes me older that the Beach Boys themselves. I don't know if that means anything but it tells you how long I have been a fan. While my main genre is jazz, rock is a close second and this album does stand out from many others I have. I guarantee you will enjoy tooling down the road with the windows open singing along with the Boys.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Fast moving. Great character study. Suspenseful. Can't wait for the next volume to become available on my kindle book list.
B003LYJUXU|3.0|The quality of the cases of the CD are not good. It looks as a copy album! Really bad news for an excellent album!
0062255657|1.0|How this perverse individual received any awards, accolades or more than zero stars is beyond my comprehension.  I won't worry about ruining the story because no one should read anything this sick person has written.  Children who watch their father servicing the maid from the rear, watching the maid in bed nude, the father trying to drown his son in the tub, dinosauer birds ripping the child's heart out, a house full of witchlike women who don't need men to procreate...no, no one needs to read this sickos thoughts.  It's like wandering around in the head of a psych or serial killer.  Waste of money and time.  Never again with this horrible wanna be writer.  Can't even donate this book to the library for fear a child will get it out of curiosity due to the title.  Dumpster bound....because it is garbage!!!
B00AW0KHMY|4.0|I think that the time of the additional scenes is very short to consider as an excellent extended edition of this movie!
B000MQ54OY|5.0|I know some people just hate this film and I'll admit that it does get a little 'preachy' towards the end, but it's just so happy that I get sucked into it every time. Great music, great voice acting and the CGI is just stunning. I love this little film.
B00004YA66|5.0|I remember this movie fondly from years ago.  For what ever reason i searched it out and found it.  The premise might be hokey but it's just good fun.
B004K4IZ3G|2.0|Amazing film to watch, the effects are outstanding, but storywise, it's lacking in my view. I found myself not caring about the characters at all. Great Daft Punk music though :-)
B00CKR63F2|4.0|I enjoyed the story itself very much. It could have used some better proofreading<br />As the errors in spelling were quite significant
B00D2K40WY|3.0|I love this app. Its kept me very busy. The only thing that I would change about it is the buying part. If you want to unlock more dresses and makeup you have to buy it. That's the only bad part...
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Very interesting book.  The first time I looked at it, I was un-enthused.  They I bought the book and read it.  Very good read.  It moved right along and keeps me involved.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|i purchased the app Toca Hair Salon 2 for $2.99. then i saw that this app was free. i was ready to kick myself. but it turns out that this app is awful so i was glad i bought toca hair salon 2 ( its my favorite app)!
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|Good story. Can't wait to read next one.<br /> Easy to follow and has a lot of action. I like the authors ideas.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Thank you Toca Boca for an awesome app! Sure, it might be expensize but it.is definetly worth it! BUY THIS APP!
B000I9W08I|5.0|First of all if you like or love musicals this is a must watch.<br /><br />My 3 girls(14,16,18) became interested in Hello Dolly, after they watched Disney's Wall-e a few years back; songs from Hello Dolly are peppered through out the film.<br /><br />After watching it, they love the music even more.  Barbra Streisand and Michael Crawford were brilliant.  Walter Matthau plays a grumpy gentleman, in which he excels. And the ensemble was superb.<br /><br />It was fun for the family. For me,  I loved seeing Tommy Tune and the Louie Armstrong cameo.  For the girls, they enjoyed the comedy and placing the songs from the animated film Wall-e.<br /><br />My husband HATES musicals, but tolerates this one.<br /><br />I do not recommend for small children they will get bored.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love puzzle games like this. Makes you think. Challenging but not impossible. Can't wait for more levels. Seemed too short.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|Great read that keeps you glued to the pages.  Author keeps the proverbial carrot dangling to keep you wanting more.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|The game Restaurant Story is a good game but sometimes its so hard!You have to serve your food at<br />almost the exact same time its ready and I warning you its super hard to get the gems.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Not the best book I've ever read. Too many twists and total reversal of of good guy/bad guy roles. I ended up really disliking both main characters. Probably won't read more books by this author.
193700788X|3.0|This book was a disappointing end to the series and seemed like she just tried to wrap it up quickly.
1878424319|5.0|This book is what I have needed for a very long time to learn how to get the person freedom I was searching so many year and had been unsuccessful in finding that freedom. I will read this book again and again until I am certain I have that personal freedom I have searched for so many years. This book will always be part of my life.
B00C7KYXHW|4.0|The show pushes the envelope of television horror...intense and surprising at every turn...Mads Mikkelsen is charming and terrifying as Lecter.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|was a gift for a friend that wanted it.  arrived promtly and in good condition.  words to fill required space???????
B004SUWR2C|3.0|This game is an okay way to kill time.  There are a number of versions and options for play you can select.  But, it's not exactly the Uno we all remember.  In particular, the scoring is strange and hard to follow.  Different opponents seem to pop in and out of games... you can win every round and suddenly be losing the game?  In general, it's an ok purchase for the price, as long as you don't care about scoring.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|The Piano Guys do it again!  This is an awesome cd, filled with music that i will listen to again and again.
B00D2K40WY|1.0|I downloaded this app for my daughters to try, because it was supposed to be &#34;free.&#34;  They excitedly waited for the download, but could only open the app and look at the main menu before being prompted to pay.  They were so disappointed, I went ahead and purchased the app.  Let's just say, it was strange.  First, you  select one of 4 models to get ready.  Next, you wash her hair.  So far, so good.  Then, the app zooms in on her face, which is covered with pimples you can pop (with tools) while getting her ready for makeup.  Ummm, ewww!!  The remainder of the app is applying makeup, picking out a dress, earrings, etc.  The end result is a model all dress up for the evening.  Then, you have to go back to the beginning and start it all over again (as in, more pimples).  Even with the paid version, there are constant pop up ads selling you other versions of this same exact game (prom, princess, etc,) I would have been disappointed with this app even if it had actually been &#34;free&#34; as advertised.  Needless to say, I am even more annoyed that I paid for this silliness.
B004X6PRO6|1.0|i usually read all the Pulitzer Prize winners for fiction but when I started this I was so put off by the violence i could not continue.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's a really good game, I enjoy it loads and the powerups are awesome I would recommend this game to all ages and I would suggest you get it
B00AMBH70S|5.0|I loved this film. Look forward to seeing more from all of these characters. Jeremy & Rachel were magnetic together.  Great story line, editing, locations, true entertainment and excitement. Hope the Gilroy boys do another one real soon! Wish they would make more movies like this.
B00ANDDBBE|5.0|I don't know about you guys, but I sincerely adore this season.<br /><br />Donna it's my favorite companion, but not only because the marveolus Catherine tate impersonate her, also (I think) she has the entire profile of a perfect companion; also, each episode it's better and better, and River Song makes her first appearence here.<br /><br />I don't know what are you waiting for.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good thing to do. Will be waiting for the other version of this if they do make one. Will be fun.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game . It's very addicting and makes your<br /> mind think. I can't  wait to at it everyday.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|Let me start by saying I've been listening to this mans beats and raps for over a decade. I've liked most of the music he's put out with more then a few exceptions. I was intrigued but skeptical after I saw his snl performance. Worried that this was going to be another rapper turned rocker album(like lil wayne or lil john attempted). I was proven wrong, this album has kept me listening close to two weeks of listening. In fact I've listened to it around 10x so far. It grows on you and refuses to let go. It took me around 3 listens to digest and embrace it. Maybe this album isn't for those with expectations of another \\"gold digger\\" or \\"all falls down\\" but this is still Kanye and he's come to \\"...tear s*** down\\".
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is very good. I couldn't put it down,or get my eyes off it.<br />I've read a lot of book by Jeff Kinney and I've liked all of them.
B007U4DDXK|5.0|You must watch the previous 2 movies to understand this one. But, just as always, this movie was totally cute. Better than the 2nd sequence, but not as good as the first.  Still, I purchased one for me, and then ordered two more for friends.... so that's how much I loved this movie.  I'm sure that I'll share my copy.  It's one of those that will make you feel better no matter how old you are!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I gave it three out of five stars because it's a relatively entertaining app, but after a while  it gets old. It's kind of hard to earn gems and you need them to buy most of the items on the game. You need the items to win competitions but you get most of your gems from leveling up.
B001WCN23W|5.0|Somewhere along the line I lost my original copy of this CD although I do still have my original vinyl copy. You can't go wrong with a classic Rolling Stones album.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I LOVED THIS WONDERFUL BOOK IT INSPIERD ME IN DIFF WAYS LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!@)=)=p lollipop millimeters I just really. Love this book l
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Hosseini brings the many threads of his complicated narrative neatly together at the end. Very readable with interesting culltural observations. Abandonment on many levels is a major theme in the book.  If you've never read Hosseini, read the  &#34;The Kite Runner&#34; or &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns.&#34; they are both 5 star books. This is very good, but it is a 4 star book.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|It has really come in handy for me. Weather I'm placing a bid or or selling an item, I can do it all thru this app. It is amazing. I've used it for a couple of years maybe more and highly recommend this app for anybody bidding or selling on ebay. It is much more user friendly than any other ebay app I've tried in the past.
B00DC7NNAC|1.0|Beyond AWFUL! One can only wonder at what point the producer and/or director realized that this movie was a complete loss. Buy anything else to watch.
B008JFUMDS|1.0|i didnt get to see the movie<br />and now im mad at the dvd because it was unavailible  its stupid
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a story! As with all good books, finishing is bittersweet. I'm sad to leave this book behind, but anxious to start the next in the series &#34;Shift&#34;.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I saw this movie back in May when it first came out in theaters in 2D. I received the 3D blu ray combo yesterday and watch it during the evening. I own about 25ish 3D movies right now and I think this one is probably the best film in 3D so far. There are so many things that pop out of the screen that you feel like you are battling again Loki too! And the scenes that do not have pop-outs look simply beautiful with nearly no ghosting. I am very sensitive to ghosting and I can notice it right away on a movie if it is present. The Avengers, however, do not fall under the category of such movies. I own Avatar in 3D as well and I still think The Avengers has a better 3D experience (I know, shocking). I hope this helps you when making your 3D blu ray movie purchases!<br /><br />By me2011
0321934946|5.0|Read this book after checking it out from the library. It was so useful, and I checked it out so often, that when the 2nd Ed. came out, I purchased it. It's not a starter book exactly, would recommend a different path for someone who is a newb with a DSLR. However, it is a GREAT book once you get to the point where you can take a picture but you want to move beyond taking snapshots.<br /><br />What I love most about this book is the way it is organized. Instead of long chapters covering topics in depth (I have and love those books too), this book is organized into one page how-to messages. The flow of the book allows for reading front to back, but does not require it. You can jump to any page and find helpful information on the topic on that page. This is why I continue to refer to this book. If I am going to shoot something new, I look here to pick up tips to make it easier.<br /><br />I could go on, but I won't. Highly recommended!
B00CE03UOC|5.0|It's so much fun. Even tho there's already so many different kinds of flow this one is my favorite. The dots are alot easier to see and when u connect them they light up neon.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved this game. My son liked to help too. Keeps you entertained. It's not too hard but keeps you exploring and figuring things out. Looking forward to more puzzles!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is amazing you have monsters ,animals,etc you can craft bombs and stuff its awesome my only think is i wish the multiplayer was on a global scale and not just local if it were global im sure everyone would have this app
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I love every book Mr.Hosseini wrote.  In each one there is humanity, profound understanding of the human heart and soul.  His characters are so complete, so fascinating that a reader cannot avoid to partake in their lives. This book, this story was a bit more convoluted than the other books he wrote. But still, a very powerful and emotional journey inside life and its stages.  A must read to appreciate more the moment, life as we have it!
B008602KQI|5.0|Let's start off by saying that I really enjoyed this movie and it was really a great movie. Just found a little bit boring the second disc with the special features that were just a sequence of interviews with the producers, cast and director boasting about their work as if it were something exceptional. Well, in my opinion they just did what they were expected to do as professionals; like in any other profession.<br /><br />With that said, while I was watching the movie, I started wondering if Suzanne Collins ever read Japanese manga from late 1950/early 1960. Why? Because the story she is telling is so similar to a manga I read while I was learning to read in early 1960. Yes, I learned to read, reading manga. The difference being that the two warriors actually died at the end; but not because they fought to death. In that manga, the two warriors are on different sides and they were required to wear masks and were never referred to by names, but by numbers only. And at the end, when only two warriors were still alive and at their final battle, one warrior manages to cut out his opponent's mask, thus revealing that the other warrior was a female. More than that, that the girl was someone he loved deeply (yes, a star-crossed lover) and the revelation makes him hesitate to deliver the final blow.<br /><br />She, then, takes the opportunity given by his hesitation and attacks. Just to find out that he was just warding her attack off and purposefully avoiding hurting her. This enrages her for she thinks he feels superior because she is a female. And then, she manages to rip his mask off and the truth is revealed....<br /><br />They were a long lost love of each other. But bound by honor, one must kill the other. She offers her life but he refuses to kill her and asks her to kill him instead. Honor demands. The final solution: they kill each other in a seppuku style.<br /><br />Of course, this kind of ending is not suitable for the American taste and therefore, Katniss and Peeta would never be allowed to eat the deadly poisonous berry...<br /><br />The storyline is actually not original. There was an episode in the Sliders TV Series where the premise was exactly the same: A game of death with only one victor allowed; and other movies with similar storyline.<br /><br />Anyways, like they say: there are no creation in entertainment, only imitation: art imitating Life and one producer imitating the other, etc. etc.
B008ULM7HU|5.0|This cd set is great, being a Duran fan it takes me back to the 80's. Mixed with other awesome Duran favorites, glad I purchased this!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|No one can read this book and not have it affect the way they look at the world. Jobs was certainly one of the most fascinating men of the last five decades, and Isaacson does a great job of being both honest and compassionate in telling the life of this stunningly difficult, brilliant man.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was fun to do as a family.  The kids liked to do as much as they could on their own &amp; then have us help them just enough to get them unstuck.
B000683VI4|4.0|This film suprisingly moved me a great deal. It is the story of a relationship told from the perspective of the 2 people in the relationship many years later looking back, only one now suffers from dementia. The acting is superb. The 2 lead actors are terrific, both the old couple and the new couple. It is a classic romance and told from an unusual point of view! It creates a myriad of emotions, a truly classic film!
B009RH9HDS|4.0|Came quickly & in good condition.<br /><br />The product itself is good quality but there are a few things that are a little disappointing.<br />- it's hard to rotate<br />- when it closes the kindle doesn't go to sleep<br />- you need to clasp it to keep it closed
B004JN1D2I|5.0|As aways, the book is better than the show. This case is not different. It gives details and thoughts that are not possible on TV, but make a huge difference in the understanding of overall history. Very nice reading.
1400067820|3.0|A wordy book that would have wider appeal if the writer wasn't so focused on<br />looking down at the rest of the world.
1400069807|5.0|I was not expecting this book to be as fun to read, given the topic.  It's a fascinating look into the motivations for our food processing -- both the good AND the bad.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I'm enjoying this so far,  the 10th level finally got me wondering.  Just think a little harder and you'll do fine.
074401493X|5.0|The Last of Us is a game worth experiencing.  And it's got a lot of collectibles and a lot of hidden goodies to explore within every area.  It's a rather nice change of pace in gaming.  So naturally, when you think of collectibles you probably also think that it would be nice to have a strategy guide to help you out in those situations.  The Last of Us Official Strategy guide is here to help.  It's a good guide overall and actually provides a lot of information about the game.  I do suggest, however, that the strategy guide be used on a second playthrough, and we'll talk about why shortly.<br /><br />The guide begins, as so many do, with a lot of the game basics.  There's actually reason for any newcomer to The Last of Us to spend time here.  While the game is more than willing to explain everything about it in easy tutorials, the guide is willing to explain the basics of everything and go a little further.  The Last of Us is a huge game and one that, at some point, really banks on you knowing what you're doing to get through.  The fact that all the basic survival and combat stuff is willing to be more than just a \\"how to,\\" guide all the time is rather nice.  Bradygames has always had a problem about talking about the difficulty settings, but with this guide you won't mind as much.  The authors note that the guide is written with the assumption that you are playing on Hard Mode (usually Bradygames writes their walkthroughs with the assumption you're playing on Normal).  The guide does talk about the basics of weapons here, but it doesn't quite give any suggestions of how to upgrade them in anyway.  It probably doesn't have to, but at least you know that all the basics of The Last of Us is covered in surprising detail.<br /><br />The enemies chapter is also pretty useful as it talks about the enemies in good detail as well.  There isn't much to say, but it does note certain things about them, such as how they attack and what you can expect from an attack.  Which is probably much more useful than specifically telling you how to go about it (though the guide is quick to point out this as well).  You will learn about your foes.  The walkthrough also calls out the new enemies as they appear.  But having this section is still going to be useful.<br /><br />Once we get to the walkthrough this is where the guide becomes truly useful in so many different ways.  Each section begins by showing you the chapter itself.  Beyond that there is always a chart that tells you what collectibles can be found in the chapter and what supplies you can find as well.  It also mentions the enemies you'll encounter within that chapter.  The maps showcased in each chapter as you arrive at new areas are invaluable.  They are incredibly detailed, pointing out every item in the area and being more than just wireframe maps.  A lot of guides fail to put a lot of detail into their maps, but here the maps are so well done that you won't find yourself disoriented if you walk away because they always make sure you know what scenery is around you and the like.  Players who hope to explore and pick up every last item in an area will probably find that the maps alone will suffice in helping you navigate through much of the game without actually reading much of the walkthrough.<br /><br />The walkthrough also points out any time you meet new characters.  It's got some good organization and a great layout in many respects.  They always point out collectibles as you meander through the world at hand.  Often times not just putting it in the main text of the walkthrough but actually having callouts.  They also highlight any new tutorials, enemies and items that pop up at any given time.  It's a really in depth walkthrough that helps get you through the game.  It's also complete with tons of screenshots to illustrate a lot of things.  It's unusual to see a Bradygames guide this well organized.  There is a lot of text, though, so you may spend a lot of time reading some parts rather than being engrossed in the game.<br /><br />All this amounts to a great strategy guide, but there is one tiny problem with the walkthrough (or huge, depending on how you look at it).  The information is sound.  The strategies are awesome, the guidance is good and those maps are probably the most valuable resource the guide has.  However, the walkthrough is very forward and direct that it WILL spoil major plot points.  It doesn't just detail what to do in an area, but also what will happen to you after you've done it.  This means for those hoping to avoid spoilers the guide has plenty of them and they won't be highlighted as spoilers.  The Last of Us is quite an engrossing game.  The story is really good and many a gamer probably shouldn't have it spoiled for them.  The walkthrough leaves no stone unturned, this includes any twists in the story and plot.  Don't take this to mean the guide isn't good.  It's a very good guide.  One that will help you uncover everything The Last of Us has to offer, it's just not shy about telling you what's going to happen.  As such I recommend it for a second playthrough.  It will help you find everything and for those who want to find everything it's going to do just that.  But the guide is also going to make sure you KNOW everything about the story as well.  If you're the type who doesn't like spoilers, save the guide for a second playthrough.<br /><br />However, even if you only wanted the guide to find all the collectibles, the guide did make sure to include a separate chapter in case you didn't want to go searching through the walkthrough.  It's very well organized and shows you everything without giving away anything to the plot.  For those who also want to know, there is also a Tags and Trophy guide in the event that you just want to know those things as well, complete with strategies and commentary.  Meaning that even with spoilers, those who want to find everything can still do so without fear of the experience being ruined.  The guide is good for a quick reference as well as those looking for more in depth descriptions.<br /><br />The guide also has a huge section dedicated to talking about the various factions you'll see as well.  It provides much of the same info as the walkthrough itself.  It treats Factions as though it is a separate game, going over the basics all over again.  But everything that's great about the walkthrough is still really good here.<br /><br />For those wondering, there's not much difference in picking up the Limited Edition Guide or the Standard Edition.  The Content in both guides is exactly the same.  Both guides are the same length.  There are only two distinct differences.  The Limited Edition guide comes with a Firefly Keychain and is in hardcover.  That's the only difference.  Three's no \\"extra content,\\" in the Limited Edition Guide.  And you won't find anything in the Limited Edition guide that you won't find in the standard.  It just has a hardcover and keychain.<br /><br />The Last of Us is a pretty amazing game on its own, so it's nice to see that it also has a relatively amazing strategy guide to go with it.  It leaves no stone unturned and often provides all the information you need to go through any one area.  For those hoping to find everything The Last of Us has to offer, this is a good strategy guide to help you out.ts rather than being engrossed in the game.<br /><br />All this amounts to a great strategy guide, but there is one tiny problem with the walkthrough (or huge, depending on how you look at it).

The guide is good for a quick reference as well as those looking for more in depth descriptions.<br /><br />The guide also has a huge section dedicated to talking about the various factions you'll see as well.  It provides much of the same info as the walkthrough itself.  It treats Factions as though it is a separate game, going over the basics all over again.  But everything that's great about the walkthrough is still really good here.<br /><br />For those wondering, there's not much difference in picking up the Limited Edition Guide or the Standard Edition.  The Content in both guides is exactly the same.  Both guides are the same length.  There are only two distinct differences.  The Limited Edition guide comes with a Firefly Keychain and is in hardcover.  That's the only difference.  Three's no \\"extra content,\\" in the Limited Edition Guide.  And you won't find anything in the Limited Edition guide that you won't find in the standard.  It just has a hardcover and keychain.<br /><br />The Last of Us is a pretty amazing game on its own, so it's nice to see that it also has a relatively amazing strategy guide to go with it.  It leaves no stone unturned and often provides all the information you need to go through any one area.  For those hoping to find everything The Last of Us has to offer, this is a good strategy guide to help you out.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Love this game,l am hooked. I play it over and over. Can't wait for next version. Hope that it's soon.
B00BGIC4I6|4.0|This is a cute movie that both genders should appreciate. Very funny. I found much of the implications to be true... and I'm just 28 lol.
B001TK8TJO|5.0|This book gives important insight into how one feels loved or may fail to feel loved although the partner may be \\"trying\\". Good book to read to improve your relationships. Will recommend it to my friends.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This is a great movie, based on real life events. Highlights the importance and bravery of Special Forces. Suspenseful, thrilling, and well acted. Must see.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Right now I am totally satisfied with this product. I am just hoping that it will last me longer than the first one I purchased. I got that one from you and it only lasted about a year and then it just would not stay plugged in. So we shall see, if something happens I will be sure to let you know. Other than that it works just fine. I would recommend it to others
B007V4LBLU|2.0|As far as recovery/substance abuse movies go this is one of the worst Ive seen. Requiem for a Dream, 28 days, and others are much better.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Best show since Lost happened to tv. I would recommend this show to anyone with a dark passenger. I can't wait for season 8. What would I do without dexter. Maybe hunt me some serial killers
B0049J5EOK|5.0|My two year old loves Buzz! Good movie for the family, not as good as the first one, but sequels rarely are.
B003YV64OI|4.0|Performed just as advertised. Bought this to replace an AMD chip that previously died after less than a week of use.
0451205766|5.0|it was a very good book to read i wanted it to go on and on and never end i tried to guss some of the people in it, but very good anyways
B0063GORYU|4.0|I play this a lot.  It is well done and a good passtime.  I'm afraid it is almost adictive, as I lose track of time when playing it and even play when watching a baseball game.
B00AWBYA2G|1.0|really really bad buffering every 5 seconds....you couldn't get into enjoying the movie at all because you would get into a song...start singing it...and it would buffer...really?
B00340O3KQ|5.0|Love this movie....it's one of my all time favorites. All star cast and awesome storyline. Can't get tired of watching John Travolta and Nick Cage go at it. Thanks amazon prime for making it so easy to watch.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Ice age village is fun and easy and you don't necessarily have to use your own money so that's good.
B0026O475M|5.0|I loved having instant access to this classic film! I wanted to share it with my 12 year old son who had never seen it.  Tom Hanks gives another amazing performance in this heart-wrenching drama.
B009GCF3Q4|5.0|I have loved all of the mystery Crime books written by Michael Connelly. He is such a great crime writer and there is a new twist around every corner. . I would recommend Mulholland Dive  to any mystery crime readers, short but exciting stories. I have loved reading the Bosch Series of crime stories from Michael Connelly. I love the way he has taken us on a journey through  Bosch's private life through every book and I feel I know Bosch personally through Michael's story telling.
0385302320|5.0|Starz is making a mini-series due out in April of 2014 of Outlander, the first book. Can't wait. This book continues the series beautifully.
B005OYKI1I|5.0|I marathoned the first five movies. This one seems to have won out by a mile. I've yet to see the sixth.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is just amazing. That one words sums it up but still does it no justice. I found out about this book and author through, sadly enough, One Direction blogs. I read reviews of this book being amazing, but still doubted it because only too often do I find myself reading a book that I find absolutely awful but everyone around me is in love with it. The problem with all the other 'amazing' books is that they're too simple. Their simplicity is boring. This book wasn't simple or boring. It actually told a story that meant something, not just 'okay here's a plot, let's write it down and publish it', but it was a story that actually spoke to me. It was as much of an emotional story as it was a physical story. So I would just like to say thank you John Green.
B00AUAL9T6|3.0|I was expecting to have english subtitles.  At least I have learned a few words of spanish.  Please get this out with subtitles, or in English.  If more people watched it, it will be a cult classic.
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|I love romantic movies, We all know it is'nt real but we love it anyway, It puts us away from todays world  for awhile
B00CW665VI|4.0|This book reminded me of a well-written Fifty Shades without the poor writing, the masochism and without the main character being totally messed up.  I really enjoyed this book!
0446554995|2.0|Once again, the formerly delightful Agent Pendergast takes a turn for the paranormal. In a series once marked by natural explanations for apparently supernatural or paranormal crimes, the authors have decided that the impossible makes more sense than the probable. In addition, those who wondered (in previous books relating to the death of Helen Pendergast, allegedly attacked by a man-eating lion while hunting in Africa) what kind of conspiracy has a trained 600-pound lion handy for such occasions, shall now find the answer to be: one with Nazis in it. Not recommended for people of a skeptical turn of mind, or people who like to watch a mystery unfold in logical-yet-unsuspected directions.
B0061JPYX2|5.0|The music is as great as I expected it to be and the cd was received in excellent condition and sooner than I expected.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|When I bought this, it was only 99&cent; and now it's $4.99. It is really a fun game an  it isn't too expensive compared to some others. The graphics are alright, but the &quot;same old same old&quot; as all the other gtas. So if you like this game, buy it!
B000LXQVA4|4.0|We received this when baby girl was around 4 months old, at that point she couldn't reach the floor and was only somewhat entertained by the whole thing. When I got it I actually thought it was defective because, as others have mentioned, the elephant seems to be facing the wrong way and is *very* difficult even for me to turn. I also thought the bug/butterfly was broken because it just flops around but I guess that's what they intended.<br /><br />Baby girl eventually got tall enough to reach the floor on the 1 setting and started to get the hang of it, then really loved the bouncing. She initially went for the spinning parts of the toys b/c she was familiar with that activity from some other toys she has. Then she went for the floppy bug, which is apparently great for chewing on. It also took her a while to realize she could turn the seat, but now she's got that covered too.<br /><br />She only recently at 7 months started messing with the peek-a-boo tiger, but she just pulls on the tiger, she doesn't push the button. Although, as others comment, that button is pretty worthless for getting the tiger to really pop out.<br /><br />But it's the bouncing that she really enjoys and that's the part that's developing her muscles so I'm good with that. The only problem is that now she's at a height where she's between level 1 and 2. I wish there was a level 1.5. If I had a way to sew in another level on the straps I would b/c now on level 1 her knees are bent. She still bounces but I worry that she's really landing hard, but I guess now she's really working her legs b/c she's practically doing burpees with the squat/jumps she's doing. I tried switching to level 2 but she can barely touch her toes then. It's surprising what a difference the two levels are.  I'll try changing levels again in a couple weeks.<br /><br />I like that there are at least the two sound levels, the music gets annoying *really* fast. So I also like the setting that doesn't make constant noise - if she's not bouncing a lot the sounds don't come on as much.<br /><br />This thing is a pretty good space hog. It takes up a LOT of room in a small NYC apartment but I managed to rearrange some things so we can leave it up instead of trying to \\"fold\\" it away. Even in the folded position it takes up a lot of room, but it at least helps a little if you do need to store it away, I just got tired of dealing with opening and closing it. The one complaint I had about having to open and fold it was that the little button you push to release the sections is pretty hard to push in. Maybe it's the angle I was working at but it was a pain (sometimes also literally) to release the sections so I could lap them.<br /><br />But for the couple issues with the toys and the significant height differences in the levels I would give this a 5. If baby girl only sort of liked it I would give it 3 stars, but she *loves* this thing - she's at the age where she is dying to move around on her own and this seems to give her some feeling of being able to move (until she gets cranky then she seems to feel trapped...). I only wish she could sit in it for longer than she does so I could get more done.<br /><br />(Update: now at almost 9 months she's not quite as interested in this, in fact, she cries when we try to put her in it. She's moved on to crawling all over so she's not fond of anything that confines her. So, like so many baby items, this was great for a short period of time.)
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is really fun. Even tho it's hard. What you have you do is make a disease that is infectious and you have to try and wipe out the human race and kill everyone I the world before they make a cure.
B00785P2QC|2.0|The game is ok but to do anything requires investment points. This means you will either pay cash or have to post on th a lot. So be careful not to let your kids go overboard.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Great game!!! Easy to play and entertaining. Great graphics. Easy to follow along and I love how the battles are set up.
0061537934|5.0|A very easy and sentimental read. Would recommend this to anyone that's looking for a light read. Among the best.
159413586X|4.0|This review contains spoilers!<br /><br />So, after reading both The Hunger Games and Catching Fire last year (and loving them!), I finally decided to read Mockingjay. I'm not sure why I waited so long....when I find a good series, it's hard for me to let it end. So I think I wanted to wait so I could enjoy it for a longer period of time. Strange, I know.<br /><br />Anyway, I have mixed feelings on Mockingjay. To begin with, I loved The Hunger Games. In my opinion, truly phenomenal. Genius, even. I loved the idea of a book about a government so corrupt, mostly because I could see it happening one day. Catching Fire was good, also, but I found myself rushing through it to see what would happen.<br /><br />I had heard many negative things about Mockingjay, so I was scared I would be completely disappointed. While it wasn't a total bummer, there are some things I think could have been done to make the book better.<br /><br />First thing is first...This may sound stupid, but I honestly found this book confusing! I cannot tell you how many times I had to go back and reread passages for clarification. I feel like there were so many characters, many of them with insignificant parts, that it began to run together. I also felt that many major events, such as killing President Coin and then the trial, were just skimmed over. What happened in the trial? What was decided? Did they end up following through with having a Hunger Games for the Capitol's children? Which by the way, infuriated me when Katniss said yes! Even if it was for Prim. I feel that it defeated the whole purpose of the uprising, to stop the control of the Capitol and the killing of innocents. Not that I think they ended up doing it...but I wouldn't know, since that issue never had a resolve.<br /><br />I didn't like that so many of the characters just dropped off at the end of the book....like Gale and her mother. I want to know what happened to them, other than just a statement and then never hearing from themagain. I also will say that this book was literally hard to get through. There was just so much execution and dying...it was so depressing. And the bleak bit of happiness at the epilogue in no way compensated for these character's suffering. It was like, you read and read, become attached to these characters, feel their pain...just to truly see that they never exactly have a happy ending. It was a struggle.<br /><br />I felt nothing when Prim died. I feel she was absent throughout the majority of the books and the love Katniss had for her was never really portrayed. She could have been involved in so many more ways.<br /><br />I will also say, however, that I loved the whole idea of the uprising and I loved reading about the events. I couldn't put this book down because I was hooked, although there was times I had to pause just to let it all sink in. I am happy with the conclusion of the series and what happened in the Capitol. I would not have changed the ending, just added more detail where detail was due. I would recommend this series to anyone, and I am very glad I took the time to read it.
B000HX6DCO|4.0|For South Park it is very crude and rude humor.  But if you like that kind of humor you will love it.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I really like t huh is game.. you can play for a while, stop then comd back to it anx eveything is good. Nothing died, fish still swimming.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|Wonderful case. Seems durable. It is easy to clean. Just wipe off with damp cloth. I like that it puts the kindle to sleep instead of having to power down every time.
B00A81NFAS|4.0|So I loved the movie in the theater and preordered the 2 Disc Combo Pack... Since it had Blu-ray and DVD and digital downloads and all the bells and whistles... very disappointed that there is no commentary option... I was really looking forward to hearing actors/writters/directory talk about the process...<br /><br />Other than that everything is great...
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Great story telling, the end was quite the surprise.  Don't we all do this though, which story of our lives do we really want to tell and which does the listener want to hear.  Lovely.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Just get it! I didn't really think I would use this app all the time but I do I have found so many great ideas and things I just fell in love with its totally worth giving a shot.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|The story about the father/son relationship is a great one.  My father had many stories and I am sure they were quite embelished.  We take away what we want to and as they say, leave the rest.
B0092S4WLY|1.0|Right when i started the game i accidentally tapped a popup and it took all day to stop loading and freezing.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME .
6305428042|5.0|Loved this movie from the start and had to have it.  Love the actresses in it and thier comedic side.  It is a good Halloween addition to my movies.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|The game is very fun. And easy to complete tasks fun for anyone in the family. Highly recommended. Keep it up. Just need more friends to help.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|My kids and I loved this movie.  It is very heartwarming, sad and funny.  I love movies that are good for kids and this one is one of those.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a pure point and click puzzle solving game with nothing added to muck up the genius of it's simplicity. I can't wait to find the next &quot;Room&quot;!
B00AS1Q8FW|3.0|not a bad film stories ok tom plays a good part just one of them movies you can watch when there's not much on. if the sports on in the house girls chuck it in the player crab a bottle of wine and a glass might  make it a bit better for ya tom anyway. aussie willie
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Great ideas and rules to live by. This book has all the good stuff from James and is well put together. Highly recommended if you are looking to improve your life in one way or another.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love this game I just hate that had to buy it when I had a free version. The free one just kept stopping.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Edge of your seat book. Very well written. I think this one was better than Gone Girl. Can't wait to read another of hers now.
B003M70O5O|5.0|Great on the edge of your seat.Can be graphic at times, but you get so invested in the characters you can't stop watching.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|God fun game some are really hard but easy to figure out some of them where to easy to figure out  I'm on 10 I hope to play more<br /><br />Brandeegartz3@aol
B003O86FMW|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because it is a really good book. It has alot of nail-biting moments and a few of them are pretty shocking!!! I recommend this book to basically anyone looking for a great read.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This is a very different and fun match 3 game. I love building the tree houses. The graphics are very good. I'm a match 3 lover and this one is one of the best.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this is a fun and challenging app. it really makes you think and exercise your brain. the app is very clever and every room is different. it puts your math and reasoning skills to the test
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I think some of the reviews for this were harsh. A lot of things were left unsaid and I'm not very pleased that I have to now wait for ANOTHER book of what was supposed to be a trilogy. However, the plot and scenes were just as good as the last 2 books and I am now anxiously awaiting another book. Hope this launch doesn't get pushed back because I don't think I can handle not knowing what happens with everyone!
B002I0J5FG|5.0|It's two great game all on one disc! How can you go wrong?  buy it.  Both are excellent game and it's a classic.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this and the Ripped in 30...found out by reading the boxes that they were pretty much the same thing.  I love Ripped in 30 so I'm giving this a 5 star too.  I gave it to my girlfriend and she enjoys it...challenging just like all of Jillian's dvd workouts.
B0011Z33ES|4.0|He has such an incredible voice it is a joy to listen to each and every song.  His smooth tone and his great reach are the reason he is so popular.
0071762345|5.0|This book was suggested to me by a the cofounder of my start up. I read it in a week and I was extremely impressed with the ideas it represented and encouraged in respect to social media and marketing. I took initiative in placing them into action with own social media work and it payed off!<br /><br />The author then states at the end to take action on his idea's and gives you an open window to contact him which I took advantage of while applying for a job within the company. He responded promoptly, creating even more excitement for me about the position. Hopefully things will work out as it truely seems like a great opportunity.<br /><br />Highly reccomended.
076115678X|5.0|THE Handbook for curly hair - must read before you visit a 'Curly Girl' salon so you know you're getting the correct dry cut.
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|J. Cole puts together a complete album here.  Thoroughly enjoyed listening to the entire body of work.  Definitely recommend to anyone who appreciates good hip-hop.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Inspiring! Great for women and men to read. I've asked bosses and fathers to read this. I yearn for the benefit of the doubt she discusses!
B00DF0POXA|2.0|Quite Simply, this album is not very good.  I really don't care how nuanced, future sounding everyone claims this album to be.  I find it schizophrenic, choppy, and not an album that I enjoy.  This being said, I have been a KW fan since the beginning.  Kanye is the Andy Warhol of our time, sometimes true genius, and sometimes it is just a picture of a can of soup.  Yeezy is the latter.
B002ZG999U|5.0|This was a gift and the receiver loved it.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|This was a very interesting movie with an unexpected and amazing outcome. If you like turn-of-the-century magic, this is far above the norm with a unique twist interwoven amid an uncertain love love story. I recommend it.
B002NZK5RI|5.0|This was a gift and the receiver loved it.
B000I62JBE|5.0|I love a movie with a triple flip at the end so I can't follow it until the surprise ending is actually revealed. Great acting and casting, well planned plot and high drama. This entertaining movie is worth a second viewing.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game...really gives your brain a good workout.  Don't give up..keep working at it..you will eventually look outside the box!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Sturdy, does its job,...protects the Kindle fire, good color. Nothing bad o say here.. Would recommend to KF owners any time
B00C061I3K|5.0|This new release from Electronic wizards Daft Punk is a true musical gem! Record of the year,  and a must have for any music collection.
159413586X|4.0|This was the 3rd of the Hunger Games trilogy. I loved it as I did the whole story. I read all 3 in the first 5 days of vacation! What a treat.
0143122916|5.0|Have many other things to do than begin this book now, but was waiting for someone and this book was sitting in my car.  Read 1/2 of it immediately.  Can't wait to get back to it.  This should be mandatory reading in our junior high schools.  Maybe then we would have less young folk that are so unpatriotic and unaware of what is going on around us in the rest of the world.  Take away their electronic gizmos, for pity sake!  It's ruining them for reality.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I tried to charge my kindle and found the cord wasn't working, however my phone charger worked.  That was great until I ran out of books and realized the phone charger couldn't download for me.  I'm back in business, thanks!!
B001PO53IO|4.0|Took a chance on this and was pleasantly surprised. Was even able to watch it with my 5 year old daughter.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Love this book...... maybe more than the wheel of time and definitely more than mist born series. Make another one!
B00BUADSMQ|2.0|I am one of the Die Hard series, die hard's. I love all of the Die Hard movies - except this one. I was so disappointed. Normally I will watch each new movie like 30 times before I put it away for another day - reviewing just in case I missed something along the way. I couldn't even watch this movie twice in it's entirety it was so bad.<br />McClaine going to Russia & inadvertently running into his son (or visa versa)on the street, was a precursor to the rest of the movie -  so totally unbelievable.<br />I had to think about this further because being a die-hard fan, I just couldn't let it go so easily how badly my beloved John McClaine series had ended. I finally figured out what the super killer was.... NO CHEMISTRY!!!! If you look back on all the previous D.H. movies, no matter how incredulous some of the action scenes were, you believed, you didn't care, because the characters all interacted so well - they were charismatic. Don't know who chose the actor to play McClaine's son, but I know he chose poorly - extremely poorly. Never for one second was I made to believe that his character was John McClaine's son - hated, loved, forgotten, or whatever...
B00915G6YE|5.0|good storyline, beware of some of the reviews that you read, because some of them give away the ending to the season.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This little jewel is perfect on my seven<br />inch pad, like holding a controller; the<br />controls are intuitive, the best i've seen<br />for a tablet platformer.  on the big tab<br />this game is fully and easily playable.<br />Collectable potential here.
B00AEBBAEK|5.0|Movie came in a good condition unopened and this is one of my favorite movies and an amazing addition to my collection also shipped fast
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Buy This.  Took a week to finish<br />for 1.99, whereas, Candy Crush<br />plays the &#34;greed game,&#34; this little<br />challenger is beautiful, engaging<br />and so . . . much fun
B00AN0KGWE|1.0|Don't be fooled like I was. I wanted the HD version because the Season 1 was so blurry. It isn't $10 more it is a $29 AND a $39 charge and it was STILL very blurry. Totally disgusted and thinking of using another source for entertainment. No wonder they charge for a whole year up front.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|today is the first time I'm playing and so far I luv it. it is so much fun to play but yet challenging. I recomemt this game to everyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|You can see the weather in my area or look up the weather in other parts of the country sometimes information is slow to change
B00CH26TL8|4.0|I was so excited to get Witch on my Kindle it is so much fun and easier to play on larger screen! The only reason I didn't give it 5 Stars is it seems to have messed up my kindle and the amazon App Store keeps dropping I will call on Monday and see what the reason is and if its not Witch doing it I will rerate the game. If anyone else has a similar problem please let me know. Love this app though!!
B0089LOG02|5.0|This was so interesting because it was a part of history that I never knew about. Yes I realize it was fictional but never the less based on what did actually happen to some children. The information and pictures the author added at the end of the book were indeed quite amazing. I would highly recommend this book! I think this story needs to be heard by all.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Me and my kids love this game we play it together the mini games r fun it gives you tasks to complete and the new animals all the time .you could by things with money but we do not we wait and earn them . So come on and try it out u might like it .
B004LWZW6U|3.0|Ok, so first up...this is a pretty bad movie...the name itself tells you that this movie is nothing more than titillation (pun intended)...but in 3D.  Now, I'm a guy (doh!) so that actually was not a bad selling point.<br /><br />The overall story, though (which is covered reasonably well in the Amazon description) is pretty poor.  What is INCREDIBLY funny, though, is David Hasselhoff. He puts in the performance of his lifetime...playing...umm...himself.  But he does a GREAT job of it.  No....I'm not kidding.  Really!  This shocking development alone is enough of a reason to buy the flick...and at under $10 for a 3D flick (that's actually shot in 3D) it's actually not a bad decision (I'm not saying it's a good one, mind you...)
B00C7JFIRC|1.0|-<br />Phooey.  Too old for kids' fun.  Moved slowly for no reason.  The special effects were cheap and poor at best.<br /><br />Even with the template of a great movie and great available content, the movie didn't hit the Oz mark.  The movie didn't develop loveable characters or ones that you could care about.  This movie didn't develop individual characters like the original, it developed a society of subservient, pacifist, socialist idealism.<br /><br />Why did the witches have suggestive lines that described holding bodies close in a kids' movie?  And, why was the witch written as a needy girl with no intelligence?  Was it necessary to go from one extreme to another?<br /><br />Even after adding characters, the porcelain girl, I still found the other characters boring and cliche.<br /><br />The political overtones were just as bad (Pacifist Unions and \\"the People\\" under the reign of a dictator who just had to make them believe to overcome evil).  The People were set as dumb and needed to be controlled with mind games and secrets.  There were no merchants in this movie.<br /><br />I was hoping for a great movie but, I ended up trying to give my copy away the next day.  That was more difficult than I thought.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|Haven't really been a Muse fan, with the exception of a couple of hits they've had.  And when this album came out, I pretty much ignored it.  The only thing getting airplay was &#34;Madness&#34;...and while I think the vocals and harmonies are absolutely incredible, the backbeat drove me crazy.  BUT....<br /><br />after a few months of hearing &#34;Madness&#34;, I got used to the backbeat...and the vocals/harmonies continued to amaze me.  Then, one day, the album went up on a lightning deal...and on a whim, I purchased it.  And learned what an idiot I can be.  This album is absolutely phenom.  The songs just flow together, and tell a somewhat consistent story.  Bellamy is likely one of the more talented vocalists today, and this album showcases it very well....and again, the harmonies.....
B00D2K40WY|2.0|did not buy it ....and just have an empty app on my kindle... if there was someway to get rid of it i would
B00846REIS|5.0|Amazing how they find a way to support each other and actually get to each other. Can't wait to find out more.  And what did he really go back up for
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I have really enjoyed playing the game.  I like the little elves building and I really like the challenges with the different item. Great variety
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Language of Flowers was recommended to me by my daughter.  This book is well written and the story line is touching.  I highly recommend it!
B007L3BMGA|5.0|A page turner...couldn't put it away...luv it great nd crisp writing!! Waiting to read the other two books eagerly...downloading them already..;-)
B008J34466|5.0|I love Pinks music and if you do too get this cd. It is great and I cant stop listening to it.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|This is a great little game. My kids loves to play it. They loved the movie so when they saw this game they had to have it.  It is fun and simple
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Loved this Bruno Mars cd as much as his first one. I cant stop listening to it. Would recommend to anyone.
B00000IUT7|5.0|I ordered two of these for my son's BRIO train collection.  I love that they are strong enough to pull multiple cars and they work with cars from other train collections.  He loves that they make noise!
B003G4W49C|4.0|I read this book recommended by a friend who usually doesn't read science fiction. At times it is disturbing but also fascinating and I can see why it was chosen to be made into a movie. The main character Ender Is a resilient child living in a cold cruel world with abilities and skills needed to defend the planet from an invasion by an enemy from another world.There is a few surprising twists and turns that kept this story moving along and hard to put down.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|challenging enough to make you think but not so hard and obscure that you want to give up. lots of fun. cant wait for the update.
B00A18KCSQ|4.0|I found out about these guys watching Live with Jools Holland. I always find something new and interesting to listen to on there. Any time I buy music on Amazon I get quick hassle free service. Order was easy to put in and delivery was quick! I can listen to this album front to back. Upbeat, funky, moody, and chill at other times.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is very interesting in how it presents a certain period of time in history. Can't wait for season four.
B000FC130E|5.0|It's one of my favorites books by Neil Gaiman with &#34;The Graveyard Book&#34;, actually this one was the first I read, and it's an excellent introduction to the world of Neil Gaiman.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I recommend this product, for work in tablets. It's fast and eficiency. Easy to use. I can edit my saved files
B003MC5N28|5.0|This is a very peculiar book, I won't tell you the story, I just recommend reading it, you won't be disappointed.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|While I did not enjoy this book of his nearly as much as Kite Runner and One Thousand...it was carefully crafted to reflect the effects of the culture of Afghanistan on people's lives.  As usual, sad, because so different from our own.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|I liked that book, the series is a bit long but the atmosphere, the characters and the action are great.
B0025KVLTM|4.0|This was always a favorite album and somehow we had never gotten it.  We played it often and loud over weekend.
B0031RS2CM|3.0|I liked this book but it's not my style of books, I found the story very repetitive and not leading anywhere.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is amzeballs!!!!!! Its so easy to play and sk addicting . (I even think its better than temple run)
B006TF6WAM|5.0|Love, hope and the will to go on whatever it costs... I loved this book, it's one of my favorites! The characters are great and the story is very moving and yet full of optimism and hope. This book just makes you feel good!!!
1416589473|4.0|I'm a GW1 big fan, and this book really gave me the an interesting link between GW1 and GW2. Even if you don't have any knowledge or experience with the games, its a good read. Historic details are well explained and are not overwhelming.
B002BWQ6H6|2.0|I didn't like that book, the story was slow and the characters quite &#34;transparent&#34;. I couldn't find any interest in this book.
B002ZG975Q|4.0|Beastly is probably going to end up a guilty pleasure of mine in the long run.  It's a romantic teen movie in the same category as the Twilight series.  It's not intended for 32-year old adult men such as myself and yet, I ate it up anyway.  I gotta be honest though- as much as I may have eventually warmed up to it, I was NOT so receptive towards the really bad writing in the beginning.<br /><br />It's about an arrogant pretty boy played by Alex Pettyfer who believes he's unbelievably attractive to the point he can get away with disrespecting his female classmates, however after he makes a rude comment towards one of his female classmates who's apparently a witch of some kind (played by Mary Kate Olsen) she puts a spell on Alex that makes him ugly, completely changing not only his facial appearance but his personality and outlook on life (due to the fact he's stuck with his new appearance).  This is his punishment until he finds a girl to fall in love with, and then the spell will be erased.  This changes Alex's perception of the world in a dramatic way.  Not a bad concept, however there are a couple issues.<br /><br />One is the most obvious one that I already mention above- this is certainly a movie for teens, and not only that, it's rather lovey dovey for the most part, neglecting to include any kind of comedy or enticing drama.  It's all romance for the most part.  One thing I find odd is that, the girl he has a crush on (played by the VERY beautiful Vanessa Hudgens) happens to find herself in a dangerous situation one evening, and Alex comes to her rescue and basically threatens her father that she MUST live with Alex.  His explanation was unusual which results in a strange bit of flawed storytelling, I think.  While Vanessa is living with Alex Pettyfer, I think it's extremely obvious the two of them would inevitably fall in love.  I mean she's basically being held right THERE (without much of a struggle- another storyline flaw) in his house, so she's basicallyavailable right then.  Lousy writing.<br /><br />Other characters such as Neil Patrick Harris feel tacky and unnecessary, as does the maid (Lisa Hamilton).  This storyline probably could have succeeded without those characters.  Anyway Alex Pettfer turning into a respectable young man gradually as the storyline moves along is decent enough writing, and overall the movie just gets better and better (though predictably so, unfortunately) until its conclusion.  I do feel guilty giving this film such a high rating but it *did* keep me attached and that's what matters the most.  You can probably guess what happens at the end too.  Highly recommended.  Just avoid the really horrible first 15 minutes.  Yikes is that portion of the movie ever deplorable.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I liked that book yet I found it quite long, all the conspiracies take too much place in the novel to my taste.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Fun game but it does freeze a lot.This game can be quite addicting and you can easily get extra credits by playing the daily tournament and spinning the daily slots.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|I have some difficulty with teenagers books, but seeing the reviews, I tried it anyway, and I was a bit disappointed.
1451695195|1.0|In the Garden of Eden, Satan said to Eve, \\"Hath God said....\\" and it continues from there.  What if, what this writer had, wasn't a Heaven experience, but Satan deceiving him to believe it is Heaven? He believes he \\"went to Heaven\\" now knows what \\"Heaven is like\\", anxious to go...yet never the need to accept Jesus Christ as his Savior; never discusses Him thereafter, and continues his life like before the \\"experience\\"? (Remember if one is not of Jesus Christ, he/she is of Satan, and Satan can \\"mess\\" with his children as he chooses!)<br /><br />\\"Near death experiences\\" is one of the many lies Satan uses. Three more? There are female angels, and angels have wings. (Asking innocently,the writer of this book saw a beautiful female...what if she had been ugly?) The third? \\"There are many ways to Heaven so one doesn't need Jesus Christ!\\"<br /><br />In summary, think of it this way, in a \\"near death\\" experience, one \\"leaves his/her body\\" goes to a beautiful place, sees some things, loves it, returns to tell others....and when dies finds it was all a lie to prevent him/her from actually finding the Truth/Jesus Christ being the truth...and in the end ends up with other \\"like believers\\" in the center of the earth; center of the earth where Hell is. Jesus Christ is sad, Satan happy, and the believer of the \\"experiences\\" angry he/she was deceived, but now, can't change anything!<br /><br />Yes, I know I will get angry responses, yet if I can save one person from believing another of Satan's lies, it is worth it! Satan is a liar and a deceiver. His goal is to deceive as many as possible and this \\"near death/etc. experience\\" is but another deception!<br /><br />How to tell if one actually went to Heaven? They return and totally focused on Jesus Christ and His will for the rest of their life! The world, and what it has to offer, is secondary as they choose to do God's will has He leads. (An example? Paul, when he said he wasn't sure where he was when he had his \\"experience\\" but when he returned a totally different person anxious to do God's will!)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just couldn't put that book down, I've just finished it and purchased the next three books of the series!!! I loved the world the action was set in and the characters were great. It's not usually my type of book but I have only one recommendation: buy it now!!! You won't be disappointed!!! Thanks a lot Hugh Howey :-)
B006M9NJFG|4.0|Big size a major plus.... well constructed and durable.  Fits well in backpack side pockets as well.  Wish Gerber would have made cooking cup out of stainless steel instead of aluminum.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I liked that book but I found it a bit long, I think the action is a bit slow in this series.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|my daughter loved this game, but my phone notifications were going nuts!  in 1 hour, my daughter racked up $60 of in app purchases of coins.. though they were not called that on the screen.  my 8yo daughter knows to decline any purchases, but didn't know she had to say no to what pops up on the screen -- it doesn't mention any money at all!  she had no idea.  way to go developers (and amazon for turning a blind eye) this app preys on kids.  they got me for $60 in the first hour, now uninstalled.
B000FC13Y0|4.0|I liked that book but I far preferred &#34;The Graveyard book&#34; by the same author, I still recommend this book if you like Neil Gaiman.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|This version really brought out how hardcore Judge Dredd is. Really doing the comic book justice. It's a bit gory, and putting the gore in slow motion amplifies it but all and all a good action flick.
B003VPWX6K|4.0|I liked this book, the story was nice and moving in a very subtle way. The main character is brought to life in a fine way.
B003MC5N28|5.0|This book was just fantastic with its shocking twists and turns. Very easy to predict, but you need to find out what builds up to the final ending.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|I liked that book even if I found it a bit long sometimes, the action parts are great nevertheless, I recommend the series.
B000068FY0|4.0|Been looking for their song &#34;School&#34; for years without knowing what it was. Great song that didn't make it to any greatest hits collection. Finally found it.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|I've watched this movie before purchasing it, it was ok... but there is a HUGE difference of watching it on bluray than in mediocre quality. The content is not that original because is the first one (wait for 2.22). Shipped and arrived to my country in good conditions and correctly.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|It was an enjoyable book. As a fellow service member, it makes me appreciate the work of these men even more. I liked the fact that the details given to describe a scene aren't dragged out but rather short and still give you enough to form a good picture. I hate long winded descriptions. Overall it was a good read. Much respect to all who have sacrificed while in the service.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|This is the best of the Rebuild so far!... still need to watch 4.0 but this is just amazing, I say it as an Eva fan too, and there is nothing like watching Evangelion in bluray, the animation is amazing, and he cg is way better than 1.11. Also shipped and arrived to my house in my country correctly :D
B00D6M86RS|5.0|This game is great I love how the game feels like actual pinball but has a sense of adventure/story at the same time. At this time I currently own THE Avengers , Captain America , World War Hulk &amp; Iron Man tables on this Kindle version I also own others on the iPad version , but won't discus those here. Of the tables aforementioned I personally found the Iron Man table to be my favorite , I enjoyed the overall layout , music , style and it didn't hurt that I like Iron Man .next would be the Avengers table which is pretty cool since it was free , I enjoyed it for all the same reasons . Next to last but still very good would be the Captain America table ,I find that for some reason I often face some lagging issues on this one for some reason and I don't enjoy the layout as much the style is also bland in my opinion with everything almost an faded tan color it seems everything blends together , however it is a good table if you look past these issues .Last would World War Hulk , I didn't care for the story I'm not a fan ,also I find Hulk yammering on about this story constantly annoying very annoying ... I like Hulk don't get me wrong ,just not this Hulk . The table itself is ok not my favorite but likeable ...if only Hulk would shut up and let me play
B00632HWOG|4.0|this yahoo mail app works great. it is easy to sign in and view all your mail and it has a bar on the side for other applications offered by yahoo.
B0088W2LC2|3.0|When I think of this stargate  I think of guns up.... They just got to a new place in the Universe and they need to find help or a power source so they gate to another world and first thing they do is point their guns at a kid and disrespect their people WOW add in the black side-kick the really stand offish leader lady who cant trust the people whos world you just came from a black lady leader who just looks at the white guy and decides he has all the answers to save her people ...sound like anyone you know ,,and we are back to the sam white washed stuff from SG1 and as long as you know this your ok.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|i love this ebay app. it is extremely easy to sign in and view all your selling or watching and you can get alerts on bids if you stay signed in.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Not once but twice I had got really far and accomplished a lot and the app froze up and I lost everything. After this happened a second time I deleted the app. Totally disappointed. I definitely do NOT recommend this app.
B003TXKSWK|5.0|as I truly love John and the Roots, this a great album and I have played it alot, some raps on it, but still a great CD and I love, Wake up, compared to what....a good album
B007D2XSW0|5.0|For a free app, it really is quite a find <counts words, up to fifteen>. the only thing better would be able to specify the Save To location&hellip;but this is likely an older version I'm using<br />EDIT: no longer free. otoh, yesterday the Lite version, which is free, had an auto upgrade to the full version. This new (to me) version is quite a bit better.
B000ULQV0W|3.0|this is a very good CD but too brief and Eddie is still the man after all these years<br /><br />the movie was great and I truly love Eddie's voice, just needed more is the only criticism I have<br />annie
B0054JZC6E|5.0|My 4 year old granddaughter plays the games and thinks she is winning.  I like it because it keeps her busy.  I also like it because it challenges me.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|She is great and this is an awesome CD<br />I first heard a contestant on Idol sing one of her songs and this was enough to sell me on this singer<br /><br />her voice is intense and she sings the ballads wonderfully too, I reccomend this one to anyone<br />annie
B005HHSYMW|4.0|I think this book could be much improved if it were half the length. But it's a great read and very convincing - with good news for a change.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The book was so great. The outcome was unexpected and kept me ready straight through. Depending on the certain characters you liked, you'll probably like the outcome.
B0081SRJSY|1.0|UPDATED July 2016: This app no longer works on my android phone.  I made the mistake of updating the app about 6 months ago and EVERY TIME I try to open it, whether I have a fast internet connection or not, I get a pop up that tells me the game cannot connect to the internet and it closes itself.  This is seriously my favorite game out there and I can't play it - and haven't been able to for months.  Fix this Exozet!!!!<br /><br />As a kinesthetic person, I really thought I would not like the app for this game.  I love the board game, it's my favorite.  In truth, I don't think a day has gone by that I haven't played this game with my husband or with the computer.  It's fun, easy, and I can still see the whole city with my screen (8.9&#34;).  You won't be disappointed!  I am thrilled they have an app for androids!!!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great writing, great acting and great production work. I really enjoyed each episode and the storyline is captivating and thrilling..
B00DIXEZTI|5.0|I normally avoid shows with any gore but the story line of this one is definitely worth the gory scenes. They've done a great job of making you care about the characters, thus, making you follow the show week by week.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I have been waiting a while to get a book the calibre of Lee Child's first Reacher series and here it is! If you are a Reacher fan this one will satisfy your cravings! I would recommend reading this book first if you are a new reader and then read the killing floor.  A really good read and worth the price.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I was forewarned that this is the kind of book that changes you in some way.  Sounds corny, but not an exaggeration.
B000MD9UJC|4.0|My mini mag is greatly improved. Easy to install. Easier to operate with the push button. It makes it a one hand operation
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Only rating this game because I have to.  In order to proceed past level 10 you must provide a rating for this app.  This is very annoying.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Its been atleast 10 years since I read Stephen King, sometimes you just move on to new authors.  But this book was recommended to me and I thought it was Fantastic!  Likeable characters with a time travel plot that put you back to the 60s.  I not only liked the plot and characters also fun to be reminded of some of the styles, cars ,music, ect of the 60s.  Can't wait to read him again SOON.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|I don't think I needed this for the Kindle.  Amazon instructions on what to load to watch video is very unclear.  I have had my Kindle for over a month and still am unable to watch videos.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I really feel like you know and like all the characters.  Every time a chapter is done about a certain character, I feel disappointed that I won't keep reading about them.  But the next chapter pulls me in right away and I am disappointed when that story line is done as well.  I like the book just as much as the Fall of the Giants.
B00A6RCSKC|4.0|Come and pass the time away before it gets too late. Very addictive for the strategic minded. Come and get some as they say.
B000VSBX34|5.0|In my opinion this is the best of the Beatles movies.  I spoke to a young lady the other day and she loved a song but did not know the artist??  The Beatles music is still so modern and has relevance today.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|There was a lot of good action, but I thought it was stupid what he did to a classic car.  It also seemed a little far fetched for a bunch of rookies to run a starship.
B007D5E7C2|5.0|While Quentin Tarantino has delievered amazing movies..this double feature is by far, in my opinion, his best work.  The cohesive storyline twists smoothly snakelike (no pun intented) throughout.  And though the original idea of this story is based on a Japanese tale (The Bride), Tarantino develops it into an epic telling of relenting, full tilt, purposeful revenge (with justifable reason).  The acting is at times both hokey (purposely) and stellar, the cast perfectly chosen (the usual Tarantino suspects).  I rate this high in my &#34;Must See&#34; catagory.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun app,not too frustrating,needs more levels.<br />This escape game was interesting without being too hard. I<br /> look forward to new levels.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|This app looks like fun  but u can't even  put the persons hair in a pony tail and the other stuff are locked  i don't like it add me on MSP movie star planet bethia06
B002ZG997C|5.0|How DO I love thee...so many ways. From the moment it began to the very ending. I was captivated. Of course I closed my eyes when Al Green was singing!! xoxoxox's
B005LAIIKI|5.0|DJANGO UNCHAINED HAS JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF BLOOD/GORE, SHOOT 'EM UP STYLE, AND HISTORY THAT NEEDS TO BE TOLD. NOT TO MENTION UNFORGETTABLE PERFORMANCES BY CHRISTOLPH WALTZ, JAMIE FOXX, SAMUEL L. JACKSON AND AN ABSOLUTE MEMORABLE PORTRAYAL OF A VICIOUS PLANTATION OWNER BY LEONARDO DICAPRIO. A MUST-SEE.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|This movie was a pleasure to watch! Each and every person played...the perfect role. Fits perfectly in my library collection.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Not boring, encouraging. Delightful, and addictive. Enjoy the option to pick up where is left off without losing any points or money.
B004SEUJ82|5.0|I love it when hollywood takes on the child. Only a child could tug at your heart, open your eyes and capture your heart...only to leave it in pain.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Was a present for a 5 yr old and my 5 and 6 yr old love to listen to her.
0345410025|5.0|If at ANY point you've ever felt incompetent in your ability to remember anything, get this book.<br />This book will teach you a few, but highly effective techniques that, as the author states, can be applied to anything. I'm having trouble disproving that, as everything from grocery lists to facts for a test to general locations of things can easily be recalled.<br />The section on reading, while brief, had some very helpful tips that have changed the way I read. Its great being able to memorize any date and fact- if you're in or are going to school, use the techniques in this book.<br />This book gets my five stars. You've outdone yourself, Mr. Lorayne.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|A terrific original idea pairing science fiction with Westerns. great cast intriguing story lines.I am sorry it only lasted a season.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great for my daughter and I to play together. Love the graphics, amount of care and activites. Couldn't ask for a better game. So fun.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Very easy to use. Support's swiping between picks and files so it's a lot like using my Ipod. The file manager is great and supports everything.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like the app.(I didn't download the update yet) But when it's cloudy and  bright, it shows a picture of very dark clouds.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Was interested in how the characters were in the books vs. the tv show.  much better all around. Happy to have ordered the book and recommending to family.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome and addictive too my 6 year old grandson taught me how to play and I've been playing it!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Good:<br />- Hints<br />- Objects aren't too easy or hard to find<br />- You can play an alternate game to remove hidden objects<br />- Good storyline<br />- Fun and a little creepy<br /><br />Bad:<br />- It's not actually free...you have to pay to unlock the game<br />- The game isn't always clear on where you need to go or go back to, which is frustrating at times--I ended up wandering around sometimes, just going to find something sparkling.<br /><br />Overall, a fun game and I will probably play it again sometime on the timed mode.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|This will wind up being a classic.  I really enjoyed this adventure and humor.  This is something I would watch more than once.
B008K9SG9K|4.0|All the songs on this album are great. Definitely give it a listen. I would highly recommend it. Tracks #1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are my favorites.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I like this game it's great but when you flip you have no control over it at all which aggravates me every time I play but it I would still give it a good rating.
B0087EVHVW|5.0|i love this processor it is very fast i cant imaging what the i7 is like love it and performs very well with gaming
B001POX73C|5.0|Of all of Georgette Heyer's books, this is by far the best.  It is easy to read and funny. I find the characters is to relate to and humorous as well.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|installation was a breeze [if you know what your doing] instructions could have been more clear but overall helped and you could follow them well, i love this product and i have it installed in my custom gaming rig i built 5 stars
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|I wanted to like it. I kept an open mind, knowing that no movie from a book is ever as good as the book. I kept a positive hope that, though things need to be cut and changed for time constraints and other reasons, the essence of the book would be kept. Like Harry Potter.<br />But no. Beautiful Creatures did not even match the books.<br />The names of the characters (those that were included) were the same, but that is it.<br />But so much that was essential to the essence of the books was missing.<br />Ethan was cooking his own breakfast? No way would Amma allow that. And Amma, worked at the library?<br />Where was Marian?<br />Where was the ghost song?<br />Ridley, was too old, wrong hair color. And no lollipops? In fact, when she was first seen in her car, I thought she was Sarafine.<br />Uncle Macon's eyes were wrong. Actually, all of their eyes were wrong.<br />Where was Kitchen?<br />And the accents? Yeah....<br />Oh yeah, and Genevieve. I'm not even going to touch that one.<br />I couldn't finish it. It started to put me to sleep.<br />And then there is the soundtrack. Another yawn.<br />I will not be finishing this. I will not be seeing the second movie. I'll stick to the books. The world is so much richer, more vibrant and has so much more depth and heart.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|T&S are the best thing about Canada period ever forever. The soundtrack for lives of cool people. I love that this is the number 1 selling mp3 album for 2013 so far.
B00A6VAW9W|1.0|Love Kenny Loggins but did not care for this. Will give it to someone who will enjoy it.<br />You must be a fan of country music to appreciate this album.
B002NZK5TG|5.0|This is a wonderful movie to have on dvd---with the theatrical release ending. You know, the happy one. Don't need the doom and gloom one-thanks very much.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|The drama never ends & the characters are funny & confusing.  Who knows what path will be chosen. Good or bad?
B0063M22QO|4.0|I enjoyed playing and look forward to spending more time with it. The different patterns are interesting and fun to play.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome game can't stop playing it is so much fun you should definitely get this app! This game rocks.smiley face:)
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This game is so awesome.  The guns look so cool.  It is worth every cent that you pay.  Get the app
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I had this on my wish list for quite a while, not really getting in the mood to read it. But when I did, I fell in love with it. What a great story, kind of a Forest Gump vibe. Characters were great, their journeys were believable.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Absolutely love this game. Great for using up time. The special stuff like zombies mode and neurax worm mode (neurax worm lets you control people's minds) is freaking awesome. If you like plague games this one is the best! I definitely recommend this game!
B005LLX582|2.0|This movie must take a lot of concentration to watch, because I have no clue what was going on.  Were they time shifting?  And why all the artsy-fartsy filming?
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I couldn't understand at first what was wrong with the guy. Was he handicapped? But he talked so well. It pulled me in. I'm not a football fan but still found those parts kind of fun too. Maybe I'll go to a game one day now. Really enjoyed it. Though the ending was sad and still somehow a silver lining.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I love most of Josh Groban's albums.  His last album was a bust.  I'm glad to see him coming back to the style I love.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Its amazing not hard also contact me for help but !!<br />no perverts please also oovoo is sabrinamendez0012 ages through 11-13also kik is kittykat5553
B000IOM1Y6|5.0|We saw them in concert a week before and enjoyed the great sound of the band. The disc was equally impressive.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|I am a born romantic,and I loved the way that such miss matched characters were attracted to each other and turned their lives around and found happiness.
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|I saw this on the market and heard about it on the IOS. I then was excited to see that it came to kindle fire. I played this for a decent amount of time and for a dollar  it's worth it. This game had a lot of throwbacks and the endless enemies and abilities in this game are awesome. The hats were pretty silly and enjoyed to watch my guy knock out an orcs teeth while wearing a turban. Very difficult for a tablet game too. Most of the time I can't find a very decent game that has some difficulty or enjoyment for more than a day game, but this one definitely knocked that out of the park. The Easter eggs were pretty cool too. I'm a big gamer, and others might not have noticed but the statues were shaped from some phone games, such as temple run or McPixel. This is definitely worth its price, and sharing your score to friends gets you coins that can go to 10000 is pretty cool to me. 5 stars on the dot.
B004YOEFG8|2.0|When talking about space, I would really expect some stunning views. Unfortunately I find most scenes are not IMAXness and the documentary has very limited 3D effects.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|loved watching this movie with my dad - you know how made it so it is bloody but the story line is great!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Well done. Totally challanging on every level. Can't wait until they add more levels.  Get started guys. You got a winner here.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Do you enjoy scary movies but also have kids, well this funny adam sandlers movie will help your kids enjoy the monsters and not be scared like you!
0525478817|5.0|This is a book my granddauhter requested and read without putting it down.  It is now being passed among her friends.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|this movie is crazy and scary with KIDS, I dont know how they got the young actors do this! CRAZY
B008602KQI|5.0|I've watched this movie over 10 times and it just never gets old.  I can't wait for the second book \\"Catching Fire\\" to come out.
B00005JXY3|5.0|I love The Karate Kid movies! This is one of my favorite Karate Kid movies. I would recommend it to anyone.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Wow, this book was so interesting. As I was reading it,all I could think of was OMG she is so much braver than I would ever be, taking on such a challange.  I'm surprised that she didn't meet more scary people on the way, and I'm glad she didn't!  My co-worker was reading it at the same time, so we got to have our own little book-club discussions each day, and she agrees that this girl was brave!  But, when you read the reasons why she felt she had to walk this trail all alone, it's understandable.  Just glad she ended up safe.  And I'm sure she got what she needed out of it...to find herself and what's important to her
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I love how I feel so much more comfortable lugging around my equipment now. It doesn't have that &#34;camera bag&#34; look, so I feel less self-conscious about carrying around expensive equipment. I also love the straps to attach the tripod, and the cushioned interior. Plenty of pockets for everything I can think of. Excellent choice for the intermediate professional photographer.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|This game is really fun and addicting also the characters are cute so I recommend you should purchase this game
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Not sure why people are saying this doesn't work with the kindle fire hd?  It worked perfectly fine with my Kindle Fire HD and the HP Envy 110 wireless printer.  If you are not familiar with HPeprint you might have some trouble with it but it does work with the kindle fire hd.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I always liked pac man and this version of pac man is awesome it is fun and is worth paying 1.99 cents so I recommend you buy this game
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Handy ... can read or listen wherever, and whenever. always with me because it is app on my android smartphone.
B007D5E7C2|5.0|Received videos very quickly after ordering. I had seen the movies before at theaters when they came out but wanted to have them to view at home when in the mood.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Im just writing this for the free gems. The games good though!Something to do when i'm bored. I wish stuff was free though.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|With the love it or hate it opening of vintage black and white cinema, Oz is an &#34;Alice in Wonderland&#34;-like movie, with strange characters and worlds, taking you on a creative journey to find out how Oz became the &#34;wizard&#34; we know him as.  The star studded cast, led by Mr. Franco, delivers an amazing performance along with stunning presentation.
B000683VI4|5.0|Get ready to cry, well at least I did.  This is a great love story that could even make a grown man cry.  The dvd quality was excellent.  Great to add this to my collection.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|This is a tough one.  Tarantino can be absolute genius at some points.  But then he can go into 12 year old boy mode where he just gets carried away with cartoonish violence and stylistic excess.  This movie was unique as all Tarantino films are and I appreciate that.  But I feel it could have been absolutely amazing and much more powerful with some editing.  It also drags on way too long.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|This blu-ray set was awesome and played great on my player.  The surround sound and visual effects are excellent.  Can't wait for another release!
B00BG08FKK|5.0|I love this musical and this CD is outstanding! It gives me more that just the highlights, and I feel like I'm watching the movie each time I listen to the soundtrack! If you love Les Miserables, this is a must buy!
B000SO7OL6|3.0|This was a gift for a coworker who was very happy with the CD.  I never listened to it so I really couldn't comment on the quality or sound but my coworker has not complained.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|Not very good, boring, and way too overrated. I guess you have to make a bad movie to win awards these days.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|OMG, I have read these books over and over again.  I found it hard to put them down and lost plenty of sleep reading.  Excellent story!
B0039OC64M|2.0|This movie was probably a good movie when it came out, but in 2013, it just didn't have enough to keep me going. It was very boring and confusing. But it does show us what we're going to be living in if we don't wake up.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|OMG, I have read these books over and over again.  I found it hard to put them down and lost plenty of sleep reading.  Excellent story!
B004ELSDZK|2.0|The description made this game sound very appealing, so kudos to the writers of the description.  Unfortunately, the game is pretty dumb and doesn't really hold interest.  I kept thinking it would improve and get interesting, but it didn't.  A very very young child MIGHT enjoy it.  Otherwise....sorry...not worth purchasing.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|OMG, I have read these books over and over again.  I found it hard to put them down and lost plenty of sleep reading.  Excellent story.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I love my adapter! It takes my camera and puts the pictures on my I pad. Just what I wanted it to do!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Awesome sauce. I love this game because it allows you to make things . Like a human,a scientist,and a cow.
B00BV1P8NG|5.0|It came on time and my girl loves it, i didnt know the eyes would be crooked so at first i was distressed, but after she explained it was a good thing to laugh about.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so awesome you can build fight monsters join others, and more. Get this app and you will love it. Not a lame copy of minecraft this is the real thing.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Its really fun if you're patient! it really matches up with the Tv show!! I love that you have to find the elements of harmony!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This game is amazing you can swing on webs it is very realistic. I encourage you to get this game. It sometimes freezes but it's ok. You will be happy If you get it I promise.
1439152802|5.0|I loved this book.  It was well written and easy to follow. The characters were interesting and the further one goes, the more one wants to know why things happened the way they did.  I liked Laurel, she's an actress but a down to earth person who was interested in others.  It was a refreshing and titillating read.
B0010SKUYM|3.0|This book was recommended by a friend. I found it interesting once I got into it.<br />The parts about music really resonated with me.
B00BPWDMP2|4.0|Lady Antebellum strikes &#34;Golden&#34; again. This CD is another great CD in the undeniable Lady Antebellum style. Clear rich voices with great stories being told makes this a must have for Lady Antebellum fans.
B008XKSW7M|2.0|The subplots were terribly disconnected...a waste of acting talent. I really, really wanted to like this story, there are so many challenges in birthing and adopting...I thought it would nice seeing a light hearted look at the challenges. Subplot of father/son competing was totally irrelevant and detracted more from the movie. Sorry, my opinion is that it was poorly written and produced. I cannot even say this was a silly movie. Even that would have made it better.
B009L7MD44|5.0|Easy to setup and self explanatory. The great thing is that it is not only for tablets but for any wifi enabled device. Now if we could just get Apple to setup a USB port on the iPad itself.. this is a very good workaround.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Day like so many authors really sells her debut novel, but as this series continues the reader really loses interest in the lives of the main characters. A handful of grammar errors throughout the novel that are somewhat distracting. If you have gotten this far through the series you might as well finish it, but beware of a disappointing ending.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have this on kindle fire, xbox, and ipod. One of the best games ever but i warn u, you will get addicted.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I got the game and love it,it's nice because you can buy upgrades on the shark and you can buy baby sharks and clothes for your shark, O and IT'S FREE!
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|I sent these to my niece because she loves Disney princesses.  She loves them and likes to peel them and redecorate with them.  They are nice because they don't leave marks, and she is able to move them around as she pleases.  This was a fun and inexpensive way to make her day!
0452289963|5.0|The book was received in a fair time,Great condition & a good read for most anyone,gave it too my grandchild to read after my reading it at least twice.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game was so much fun. I didn't stop playing until I wasl finished with all the levels. I cant wait for more.
B00CLZ48FA|3.0|once you get past the bad special effects and even worse acting, it's okay  but whatever this is from a special effects nerd, so.....
0316067938|5.0|Every single one of the books in this beloved series is absolutely stunning!  This fourth and last one wraps everything up in a very satisfying way, while delivering a solid story in Meyer's signature style, which is so riveting, it continues to gain new fans for the series even though this edition of the last book was published in 2012.  The last movie was shown in theaters in November of that year.<br /><br />Edward and Bella's storybook wedding at the Cullen house, and their subsequent honeymoon on a lush tropical island off the coast of Brazil (Carlisle's gift to his wife, Esme), mark the very romantic beginning of the novel. Everything is deceptively peaceful....<br /><br />Then Bella becomes pregnant, thus setting off the novel's central conflict, for the child grows very quickly, putting her life in danger. Edward and Jacob both want her to have an abortion.  She refuses, enlisting Rosalie's help in keeping that from happening.<br /><br />Of course I loved this novel! The details involved, Meyer's meticulous care to make sure all threads were neatly tied up in the end, are nothing short of masterful!  As was apparent from the very first book, her characters are thoroughly fleshed-out, her settings beautifully described, and each event in the story seamlessly leads up to the next.<br /><br />Bella finally comes into her own in this novel.  All her clumsiness is gone; she is now as graceful as a gazelle.  And, as a newborn vampire, she's also stronger than even Emmett, easily beating him in several arm-wrestling contests, much to his chagrin.  Yet, she's still the Bella that all of us fans have come to know and love, who is heroically self-sacrificing, deeply cherishes her loved ones, and who now turns into a fierce protector of her unusually gifted daughter.<br /><br />One of the things I especially admired in this novel was Meyer's depiction of a young woman who resolutely refuses to abort her baby, even though the pregnancy endangers her life.  This is evidence of Meyer's very strong pro-life stance, with which I wholeheartedly agree.  It's also beautiful to see how all the members of the Cullen family do everything in their power to make Bella comfortable during her unusual pregnancy.<br /><br />In fact, the Saga's overarching theme is the sanctity of human life.  The Cullens, just like the Quileute werewolves, are totally committed to protecting humans at any cost, each in their own way.  Life is inextricably entangled with love, and this love is a living force that, in turn, makes life precious.<br /><br />The setting of Forks -- which, in this book, is the only location in which all the action takes place -- is perfect for the unfolding drama.  The lush, green forests, the meadows, the almost permanently cloudy skies....all form an appropriately turbulent backdrop for all the ensuing events in the novel.  Furthermore, Forks is where it all began, in the first book, so this last novel brings everything full circle back again.<br /><br />I think that Meyer's solution to the love triangle of Edward, Bella, and Jacob, which took central stage in the third novel, Eclipse, is absolutely brilliant.  It's clear evidence of her inventive power, and ties things up very nicely.  Some have criticized it as being a little creepy, but I totally disagree.  Yes, it's unusual, and totally unexpected.  But that's precisely why it's so very perfect.  Also, it allows Jacob to go back to being Bella's best friend, which is what he was to her in Twilight, as well as at the beginning of New Moon, the second novel in the series.  In other novels, such triangles have usually been resolved through the violent death of one of the people involved.  In keeping with her overarching theme, Meyer has chosen a totally original resolution -- a non-violent one.<br /><br />This was my third reading of the novel, and it surely won't be my last!  All of these characters are now like family to me, and so, I feel very strongly tied to them.  I love themall -- except for the evil Volturi, of course, although, as villains go, they are truly magnificently depicted.  Thanks  to Meyer's skillful, psychologically informed writing, I know them all so well -- their dreams, motivations, thoughts, feelings.  I will always return to this book, as to the preceding three in the series, in order to become immersed once again in this lushly romantic, incredibly compelling story!all -- except for the evil Volturi, of course, although, as villains go, they are truly magnificently depicted.

B009UNGYHG|4.0|Battery lasts a long time on the earpiece, but the case makes it so I can go a pretty long time without plugging in.  I like having a place to put my earpiece so that it doesn't looks so interesting to the kids.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It is a amazing story. Very detailed and has a great storyline. I can't wait to read the next one!
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I liked this book. Having first seen the movie, I enjoyed putting the actors' faces with the book characters. And because I love Zach Efron, that totally wasn't a problem for me!! I thought the book moved a little slow for my taste, I wanted to keep reading but it wasn't like a page-turner or anything. Basically it was a good, clean, entertaining drama and I would recommend it.
B00BLGXL3U|5.0|Tremendous.  Overwhelmed expectations.  From beginning the end, a lovely arc.  Suffused color.  Vulnerability of the human experience, seeking love.  Acting off the hook!  Phoenix and Hoffman.  Postures, gait, cadence DIVINE.
B004EWEX9Y|4.0|Cable was simple to install....charges I phone while playing.  A COMPONET cable I believe is needed if tv is new HD.
B0045HCJRG|5.0|If you like Brendan Frazier and haven't seen this film its worth seeing. Christopher Walken is always hilarious - great movie.

B00280LYIC|5.0|People who have read The HARRY POTTER SERIES should also read this book and the other books in this series.<br />I have enjoyed this book! :)
B00AB7HESI|4.0|It's really fun and i play it all the time. The only problem, which is why i didn't give it 5 stars is that if you ever play Scribblenauts unlimited for the nintendo DS and 3DS, you would see that about half the levels are the same.  Though, I love the music, graphics, game design and basically everything in this game, I think that the level designers could use a little more creativity.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome I love this game and my horse is so cute and fun to be around!<br /><br />If you can't afford a horse in real life then this is the way to go. It's like being able to have a horse in a town home. I love it. I know you folks will too!

B007SGLZP8|4.0|I gave this 4 stars because it was a good read - not Grisham's best, but definitely an entertaining read.  I have read most of his books and this one is pretty much what you would expect - the main character is an attorney, it's set in a southern state, and there is an interesting plot.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|This book is a fantastic sequel! Must read-Lena goes through hell to get her life back on track and  in the process finds new love.

B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Amazing.  The band is rejuvenated and reenergized and it is apparent in each and every song.  I haven't been this excited about the band in many, many years.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoy games that challenge my brain and this one does that and combines hidden seek and find. This game is great 5 stars in my book.
B00DGN51O8|3.0|It was a good movie.  Well worth my time and money.  It was just not my favorite story line.  I recommend it.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|My daughter & I watched Season 4 together.  We were so glad we didn't have to wait a week for upcoming episodes.  I didn't realize when I agreed to watch Doctor Who with my daughter, who is 13, that I would truly enjoy the show.  David Tennant is excellent in this role.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The Amanon Kindle Fire 5 ft USB and the Amazon Kindle PowerFast for Accelerated Charging  both work great together. I now can charge my Kindle Fire in under three hours. This is a great item and everyone should buy these two products.

B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I got this game as the free app of the day and now having played for the past 2 weeks i would have gladly paid for it.  It's a retro fast-paced shooter game like Space Invaders, Asteroids and Galaxia. Anyone who had the classic game consoles of the 80's will LOVE playing this game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed the game :-) ...can't wait for the updates. Please make it soon. Holiday themed rooms would be really fun too. :-) Thanks for the fun app.

B0032CVAQQ|5.0|The 5 Love Languages helps us understand our need for genuine love and to identify the main ways in which we like that love to be expressed.  It is especially helpful to couples if they want to know how to truly love each other and to help their relationship thrive and not merely survive.  However it doesn't just apply to couples, but to everyone - if we put these principles into practice every day they will be a blessing to everyone in our life. The need to love and be loved is foundational to every human being and this book shows us ways to do this, that's why I've I've given it a 5 star rating.

B00D2K40WY|4.0|I babysit all these real little kids , and they love playing it. To tell the truth I sometimes make my own princess. The'm only problem is that all the really pretty characters , dresses, jewelry, and more r locked so u have to unlock it
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I loved this book and read it mostly on a trip (plane and train). It is dark and mysterious and romantic and one of those books that you are thinking about when you're not reading it. The characters and imagery is so rich - really fascinating and fun book.
B002RXVNYK|5.0|I got the product really fast and it came in a very protected box. I recommend it! Aurora is one of the best Avishai albums!

193700788X|1.0|What. The. Hell.<br /><br />Ever So Spoilery...<br /><br />This was so oddly written. The voice didn't sound like Sookie at all, but a person going through the motions, alternating between teenager sullenness and elderly worn out apathy.<br /><br />Harris' choice to alternate between 1st person Sookie and 3rd person all-the-many-villains was pure laziness. In the past, there had always been a certain amount of cleverness to how the plot had to play out due to it all being 1st person. In Dead Ever After, Harris decided to just spell it out for us, as if she couldn't care enough to make the effort.<br /><br />The plot was a jumbled mess. Characters came and went for no particular reason, casseroles were made and delivered, villains ganged together. Where previous books could nearly stand on their own, this tangled web was hard to follow, what with dragging in characters from all over the Sookie timeline and mashing them together without much explanation--- and definitely no plausible explanation.<br /><br />Harris steadily went about trashing one beloved character after another. No one could be redeemed, all that was once cherished was suddenly meaningless and dropped like used tissues to roll ploddingly towards its doom for the sake of just ending it already.<br /><br />I don't care who Sookie ended up with. A couple of books of heartbreak and angst and realizations and what not and Sam could have been her soul mate. Instead, he's a shadow of a character whom she has creepy creepy CREEPY dirty trailer park sex with. Seriously, it would've been less creepy for her to end up with Dermot, the visual twin of her brother. Well, maybe not...<br /><br />I keep going back to the beginning. When Bill was the love of her life and then vampire politics made him a villain and things went to hell. Or when Eric forgot his centuries as a vampire and we got a glimpse of what he would be as a human.<br /><br />A magic get out of jail free card and Harris doesn't use it to return even one vampire to their humanity? And when it is used, it turns Sam into a beaten dog despondent over having been momentarily dead?<br /><br />Any way she turned the story, it could've been beautifully done. Hell, with her former effort and passion for writing, Harris could've made Claude the fricking hero. It would've been weird, but...<br /><br />Or, she could've just killed Sookie. That could've been pretty spectacular. Sookie could've gone down in a blaze of glory or a martyr for everyone she loved.<br /><br />It wasn't what happened, it was that it happened badly. This was a horribly written book, not at all in line with the established story.<br /><br />It was wholly disappointing, even though, secretly, I kind of always loved the idea of steady, affable Sam being the last man standing. Now it just makes my skin crawl.<br /><br />Shame on you, Harris, for foisting this mockery of a book on your loyal fans. I'm going to pretend this never happened. Actually, I may pretend Dead Reckoning and Deadlocked never happened as well.one vampire to their humanity?

B0087ZG7GQ|5.0|Very, very good movie that makes you re-think what is really important in life. I watched it years ago, and yet I still remember every moment of it.<br />Jim Carrey plays a very unusual role for his image as a comic actor, and plays it so well, that you instantly forget all his other roles. He is suddenly not that goof that makes funny faces, but a great dramatic performer who gets under your skin and stays there.<br />I don't want to write a lengthy review - just do yourself a favor, watch it. You'll thank me later.<br />The theme song \\"Change your heart\\" originally written by Korgis and performed there by Beck adds to this long-lasting impression.
B00AAQHP66|5.0|We saw this in the theater and instantly put this movie on our &#34;Must Have DVD&#34; list.  Incredible true story with so many real life discussion topics.  This is not a lite- hearted hokey surf movie, what I did on my summer vacation, how I spent my millions playing in the sun type of movie... This is a movie with heart and soul.  Great for youth, great for adults.
B002KKCVX2|5.0|The Teva Tanza Sandals are very comfortable, fit well, and are adjustable in three areas. Three Velcro straps allow you to custom fit them to your feet. The materials are of high quality, so these sandals should last a long time.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|This was a fun movie to watch during this season of TV reruns.  Language is a little strong, but the action is great.
B00AF7Z44K|5.0|I loved this season!  It was both suspenseful and funny.  The bond between Merlin and Arthur is incredible. I enjoyed the direction the writers and producers were taking this season.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|My hsuband and I really liked this movie, it was inspiring and a very sweet story about the relationships and heatbreak we go through in life.<br /><br />Awesome
B00B5A9FOG|4.0|The 5th Season for me was a bit too dark and sad.  There was so much more they could have been done to end the TV show.  I felt like it was very incomplete!!!  It seemed like producers/writers wanted to end it too soon.  Merlin really needed a 6th Season to end the show properly.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I LOVE THE SERIES, BUT HATED THE WAY<br />IT ENDED...COME ON...Matthew looses Mary,<br />get seriously injured, Looses his fiancé; Looses<br />his sister-in-law; looses his money; now his LIFE...<br />not believable....
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Lots of fun.  You don't have to do any brain storming just something to relax with it does go quickly so take your time.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Amazing every time, moving and thinkiing what is the best move to make the ultimate completion...all the suites together.  The thrill of seeing it come together and sometimes, being stumped and reworking it...ahhh, I got it finally.  Another one of those great brain exerciser.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Defending Jacob is a wonderfully entertaining book.  The story keeps you curious and wanting to know more while at the same time makes you almost hope you don't.  The characters are well developed, interesting and like able.  I would recommend this book to both male and female readers as well as book groups.  I give it a 4-1/2 Star rating only because I was afraid of what the end of the story would bring and didn't care for the way Mr. Landay ended it, even though it was probably the only way the book could  end.  So as I say in my headline, read it, you won't be sorry.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Angry birds is so addicting.  Finally, I game I can play just as good as or better than my kids!
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|Love both the head actor and actress in this movie. It was funny, I could've done without some of the swearing but it was rated appropriately. I just think it would've been just as funny without it.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I really liked playing this game, but it at the end of each game, I had difficulty getting it to let me play again (of course this could be operator error, but it happened more than once). I liked being able to play with other people and using more than one card.
B008OM0EDO|4.0|I liked the kind of humor this movie had, you don't see it often enough. Stuff like this, Borat, Jackass1/2/3, that movie with Johny Knoxville driving a car with a confederate flag on his roof, weed content movies. This was good.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this game...it's challenging without being too difficult.  Just the right balance if you're looking for something that actually makes you think.  Looking forward to additional levels to continue the fun!
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|If you can make it past the first 30 minutes, it's an okay film. Lots of action but the plot is ridiculous.
B00CQGU9GG|3.0|Simply put... I was hoping the brickwalling was a rumor so I checked it myself.  Well it's true.  Why the hell can't you mastering idiots get it through your head to leave these recordings alone?  They are classics for a reason.  Do you do this crap just to get your name in the liner notes?  Are you that big of ego maniacs?  Also, although you didn't do it to this box set. STOP putting extra tracks on the classic albums.  Leave them alone.  Here's an idea.  Why not put all those extra tracks on a different damn CD?  Note to CD buyers.... if you see &#34;Original recording - Remastered&#34; stay away from it.  Love ZZ Top.  Hate these recording idiots...
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I fell in love with this series from the first episode.  The cast is impeccable in many ways, the setting is beautiful.  It is comforting to see people in a decent way of life which is not dissimilar to the precepts I was brought up with, even though I certainly did not have similar rank, land or money - far from it, my parents were &#34;working class&#34; but they taught us dignity and decency, and that is the basic theme of Downton Abbey, along with history, romance and drama. As I said at the beginning, I love it.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I like the chapter format.  It left me wanting to know what happens to a couple favorite characters and read #2.  The ending was a surprise and over the top.
1451697686|5.0|This was one of those overnight reads. I think the best a person can do is provide knowledge for others - what Bea successfully does.<br />The only personal comment I have is that on my priority list for being green being zero waste is not as influential as being vegan.<br />Going vegan is the easiest and quickest way to lower your carbon footprint, reduce pollution, and save energy and water (not talking about reason number 1 - stopping violence against animals).<br />That been said, I do think one has to do everything possible to lower the drastic impact of our consumption society, and that includes going much less wasteful than we are now.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|I was looking for a good survival knife that wasn't too expensive.A friend of mine,sdnt me a you tube video on this particular knife.After I saw this video,I was sold.You cannot get a great quality knife for this price !<br />The vendor must've sent it out the same day that I ordered it.because it came within a few days.<br />You will not be disappointed with this product.and it also comes with lifetime guarantee from the manufacture.
1449410243|5.0|With fun illustrations and laugh out loud witticisms, &#34;How to tell if your cat is plotting to kill you&#34; by The Oatmeal;  confirms what cat owners have suspected all along.  Enjoy a goofy read and learn what your cat is up to in between scarfing kibble he outwardly disdains and trips to the catbox where they scratch up enough sand for an oasis - this book will de-stress your day!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|So glad to finally see this series come to a fitting ending. Very difficult book to put down from start to finish.
B009NF6IPE|3.0|Unless things have changed a lot in India, I find it hard to beleive that a couple from the higher classes would adopt a child from lower classes and have their elders accet that child with so much love. Having said that, it is indeed a pity that in so many cultures for economic or political reasons parents choose to &#34;get rid of &#34; daughters born in lower classes.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Well written with great character development. Fast moving and unpredictable, the story keeps the reader intrigued. I would recommend as a great summer read or to anyone who enjoys John Grisham type novels.
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|I bypassed this movie for a few weeks because of the ratings. Since I have not read the book, I felt I might enjoy it more than those that had read the book, especially since I like movies in this genre.<br /><br />Acting:<br />The lead actor with the southern accent thing was noticable, mainly because I have a strong southern accent. I felt it was a bit too much but did not ruin the movie. It seems to be stronger at the beginning then weaken as the movie progressed. His acting is somewhat static and monotone. No personality.<br /><br />The lead actress spent the majority of the movie trying to make people not like her. It worked for me as well. Even less personality.<br /><br />The other actors in this movie gave very lackluster performances, except for Jeremy Irons. Irons was the best part of the movie. However, this was not even close to his best.<br /><br />I found it very difficult to like any character in this movie except for the role of Macon by Irons. They were either bad people or uninteresting characters with brief, poor roles.<br /><br />Storyline:<br />A teenage girl, a Caster (whatever that is), is going to turn good or bad on her birthday. A romance that cannot happen and a family curse is thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />Cinematography/Graphics/Same area: The cover/artwork for the movie is the most interesting part of this movie and it is not in the movie. No great special effects, kinda boring in that department. The tornado scene was the best computerized graphic. The location scenery was pleasant. Ravenwood Manor was disappointing. On the outside the manor appears very old, the inside is sleek and modern with almost no furniture. Costumes were lacking for everyone involved. Makeup was uninteresting. The lead actress looked like she had a home perm gone bad, then tried to brush it out. An old lady with bright purple hair?<br /><br />Family friendliness: If there were dirty words, I did not notice. No nekkid people nor sex. No real graphic violence nor blood/guts. People do get killed. I doubt kids will find it interesting.<br /><br />In my opinion, this movie failed in every department. It did not keep my attention well. At times, I considered just stopping it early. I did not care about the characters nor what happened. The ending was boring.<br /><br />I feel this movie ranks about a 2. If Jeremy Irons were not in the movie, I would rank it as 1 star.lence nor blood/guts. People do get killed.

B0002VFXFE|3.0|I just got my package today. I found it on the ground with big black boot prints on it, like it had been stomped on, and holes and tears all over the envelope. I honestly though that sometime during shipping someone had made these tears to steal my product. After I had opened it I found my little syringe slightly damaged. The paste hadn't gotten free, but the applicator has taken some damage. That's why I rate this 3 stars
B00BSBUZT6|2.0|I love the Eagles' music and their contemporary concerts. I also agree that the documentary is excellent. However,the profanity,drug use,and sex in the pre-breakup period made them look like immoral idiots-I had to stop watching it. It is hard to recognize the apparently responsible, intelligent,sober current Eagles in the obscenity-ridden early years. I can't and won't watch it for that reason. I was hoping for some \\"repentance\\" of sorts, but in the portion I saw there was only rationalization of the behavior because they were young and everyone did it. It's a miracle that they are not dead,seriously ill,or in jail.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Amazimg!!!! I recieved my copy last week and haven't stopped listening to it since. With the wife out shopping I threw this disc in the home stereo and blasted it. My two boys came running out of their rooms asking who was that? I told them that that's dad metal. Not the crap playing on the radio today. My boys thought it was really cool and now are turning their friends on to this. They loved the sound and the progressiveness of the songs. Loves Scott's drumming and the killer twin guitars of Whip and Parker. The backbone of Eddie's bass but most of all the vocals of La Torre. Saw them on tour in Houston and that was the best Queensryche show in 20yrs. Sorry Mr. Tate you will not missed by this long time (1986) fan
B0050DIWFC|5.0|well written and well conceived--while it was obvious that Jacob was the murderer, yet the tale was cleverly spun  and held the reader's interest. The mother's solution to resolve the situation was a surprise, but actually fit in well with the whole plot. This is a book that should be highly recommended.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This is my favorite show of all time. It's been on my wish list for years and I finally grabbed it when it was the deal of the day - I got it at a steal! The West Wing is amazing because it makes you really think about political issues and how the White House staff has to handle them....and although it is a democratic office it doesn't shove liberal beliefs in your face, at least not before considering all sides of each argument. Beautifully done.
B007I2BZIE|1.0|sucks angels!<br /><br />really blows and I am a Rush fan from way back butt not no nore<br />no nore of this high pitched whine from Geddy Lee, he cant sing a note<br />anyways and the Lyrics are pathetic nobody butt a rush fan<br />bought this album anyways, and for the CD it was a rip too<br />RIP Rush.
1881273377|5.0|My husband only &#34;reads&#34; books on tape/CD.  So, when I heard about this book I immediately got both the printed and audio versions.  Its an excellent fresh look on marriage and satisfying your spouse.  I am thinking about purchasing the books that pertains to love languages for teens
B002CMQS1O|2.0|A lame attempt at spoofery. Silly, but so stupid and plodding, I wanted to change the channel, see what else was on.
0802473156|5.0|What a refreshing look on marriage.  My husband and I are frustrated with each other -  he with saying he does and does, but is never enough for me, and for me that he does nothing that I ask him too.  It seems as if we are trying to give our language to our spouse.  I took the test and determined that I am tied with &#34;Acts of Service&#34; and &#34;Quality Time.&#34;  My husband needs to take the test, so I am optimistic about our future.  If nothing else, it has opened the door to some mature, civil communication between us.
B004PAHZMC|3.0|The finish and finish quality is goo expect their are different zippers, it doesn't interfere with the operation however it looks out of place.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Can You Escape was enjoyable, liked searching for things just need more levels, I finished the 10 levels fairly quickly.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This book was awesome. It was even better than the movie. I would love to read more books by Frances Burnett.
B002M5E2DW|4.0|I don't agree with every thought in tis book, but I benefited GREATLY from reading it. I will read The Secret a few more times over the years. Thank you.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I think this is a great app. It's very easy to use and easy to navigate. I use this all the time.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This is the game i was waiting for vita, i didn't play the previous version so i cannot compare, but this game made me charge my vita after a few months of no use, full recommended for RPG fans
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I like diamond dash because you have to use hand eye coordination and it makes you think fast. You also have  to keep up with the colors and numbers. I would recommend this to young and old alike, it keeps the brain moving
B008MAI0WK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I was completely ignorant of the Linux OS and was just recently introduced to the Raspberry Pi Computer, so this book was a no-brainer to have!<br /><br />It did not disappoint! I had no idea it was so similar to Unix, but that should have been obvious...doh!<br /><br />It has been a tremendous help and would recommend it to anyone who has no idea what the Raspberry Pi Computer is all about!
B000FCK65W|5.0|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn shows how a child grows and cherishes life even during the hard times. I read this book in high school and again now and found it amazing both times.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|I am really impressed with this app. My daughter keeps sending me little videos of my new grandson via e-mail since we live in different states. I normally would just save the email and go back and forth to them but now I don't have to. I have a kindle fire and could never figure out where to save these clips. Not only did this app let me save them , to my surprise, the ones that I thought i had downloaded a long time ago but couldn't find  suddenly appeared in this app. This app was simple to use as well. I really love this one and I highly recommend it!
B000I9YLUI|5.0|I know most people will disagree with me. But this is my favorite version of Pride and Prejudice and Matthew as Darcy.... Be still my heart !! I LOVE seeing him walk across that foggy field !! I just loved it. Again I know most people perfer Colin Firth as Darcy but for me Matthew Macfadyen was more how I had him pictured and I think Keira Knightly was great as Elizabeth. Just a fresh take on a classic and I enjoy it each and everytime I watch it :)
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|I bought this album today and immediately went on a long drive in the country away from everything with nothing but my thoughts and this record. I cranked it up as loud as my stereo would allow and just drove. I was literally sucked in with every moment from the epic opening to the final note of the amazing live bonus tracks. Being a fan of this band since the late 80s/early 90s and dealing with disappointment after disappointment, I was smiling and rocking out to this record during my entire drive. A few moments even brought tears to my eyes because my faith has finally been restored in my favorite band. The sound production is great and the songs are very well written! Fast harmony guitar solos are finally a big part of the songs again and executed with perfection! Mr. Rockenfield, Mr. Wilton, Mr. Jackson, Mr. Lundgren, and especially Mr. La Torre, THANK YOU FOR RESTORING MY FAITH IN QUEENSRYCHE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You guys are the REAL Queensryche and I look forward to seeing y'all the next time you come back to Nashville. Keep up the great work!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed this game. Even tho at times I thought  was not going to get out. In deed takes common sense and good tactic!!
B009IA9OLE|4.0|Basically I liked this game.  It starts out pretty easy, but after about 15 cases, it has gotten hard.  It seems like there are only a few different things to do, and you have to be lucky with them to win the harder cases.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoy this game<br />It keeps me going from level to level without getting bored. Highly recommend it. Good brain teaser.
B00B29J0I6|4.0|This is a physics based game, similar to others.  I liked that some of the levels require you to remove the supports at specific times, so it added a little of time tension to it.  But in the free version, I got through the levels quickly and now it keeps bouncing me to an evaluation screen.
B000P0J06U|5.0|I had been looking for this movie for a long time. I love this movie it's the best Batman movie ever. The rest are not worth my time.
0425263924|5.0|read the other 2 books in this series.  So far ,loving this one as well. More words again?  Get a grip people
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Big Fish all I have to say about this movies is that it is great. Albert is my favoriate actor. It is worth more than five stars in my book.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|It was really fun to play. I think it was a great edition to cut the rope.<br />Get this app
B00AREIAI8|5.0|More please..I love my beauty.I love this app.  Keeps you wanting to play more and more....thank you! And you play with other players.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I like  how you are able to adjust the sounds to create a custom effect plus the variety of sound you can choose from.
B00C5W3SBE|3.0|The tale was surprisingly enjoyable!!!!!  I KNEW the special affects would be good and they were really visual and the way the tale was spun it is definitely the lead into &#34;the Wizard of Oz &#34; movie made by Judy Garland.!!!!!!!  Now I will go buy that on DVD!!!!!!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love these &quot;logic&quot; type games, but often find find them too difficult to complete.<br />Even my literature-based brain was able to solve all the levels without assistance.  I recommend this game to anyone who likes to think without becoming frustrated.Five stars !!!!!
B001CEE1YE|4.0|It's missing the Animatrix to complete the set!!!!!!!  but other than that it is a great set and maybe you'll sell the animatrix at a later date!!!
B004EPZ0AC|5.0|AWESOME DEAL!<br />Bought it for my students. Great condition and brand new packaging. I have not played it yet, but it looks perfect.
B00BN3DPQ4|4.0|I liked the trailers and the movie didn't disappoint.  If you want top notch acting and Academy award performances then you don't watch Arnold's movies!!!!!!  If you are looking for pure escapism and action you see Arnold ( and Bruce, Van damme, Stallone!!!) I didn't realize how much I missed the governorator but I did!!!!!!  the corny very obvious lines and all!!!!!  Glad he's back where he belongs.<br /><br />Rodney Malloy
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is absolutely wonderful. My kids really truly love it. All the work that goes in to taking care of horses it may even prepare them better for the real thing. If that ever happens
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|The son is a big twist in the story and of course Bruce is vintage Bruce!!!!!!!  I really don't see why all of his kids always have to have a problem with him but he made the movie work and that is why I'm always a Bruce Willis fan!!!!!!
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Bought this to take to the pool while on vacation.  Needed to be able to charge our phones, iPad and Kindle without taking them back to the room.  Charging two devices at once is great and it had plenty of juice to keep us going through the day.
B00B769XB8|4.0|This could be the start of something big here.  Is this another Franchise in the making?????  Even my younger brother the Star Trek purist loved it!!!!!  That's saying something!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Jeremy Renner is becoming an action star!!!!!!!!
B000IJ79WU|5.0|Great movie. I liked it much better than the original version. Watch Superman the Movie (Extended Version), Superman II - The Richard Donner Cut, and Superman Returns. You will find an awesome trilogy that flows very well together and increases the lore and greatness of the Superman story.
B008QYT7DI|5.0|Because it is happy and sad.  That is all.<br /><br />-Abraham, aged 7<br /><br />Abraham wants to know why he is required to have 8 more words in this review.
B003MC5N28|4.0|Good it was very very good but I didn't really like it but I liked the story very a lot
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book provides an in-depth study of characters interwoven by tragedy.  With great wisdom, the author explores how a single act in childhood can forever influence people for generations.  This left me with the same reflective feelings that I experienced after reading The Kite Runner.  I definitely recommend this book!
B005F96URI|5.0|One simple word. Gackt. Because of him this is one of the best movies of all time, and I love the comic-book feel to the storyline as well. The fighting scenes are awesome, and I can't believe it was never in theaters.
B005GFPZYK|1.0|This the first  and LAST book from this author .  Too much jumping around.  Also not a very interesting book, story.
B000GFLE1S|5.0|This is a WONDERFUL movie! I will be watching it over and over.<br />I highly recommend this movie to all movie lovers.
B00DF0POXA|3.0|Some good tracks but not his best. The songs that are poppy really bang but some about bring a dad are a miss
B005Y1B3Q0|4.0|Guns, guts, explosions. A day at the office. Even humor. People can die in the most funny of fashions. Bye !
B00BWDJILG|4.0|Joshua Redman continues to expand his range with this recording.  Using the best sideman and a full string accompaniment, Mr. Redman pushes into a group of tunes that are listenable, interesting, and musical explorations of classics and new standards.  In a way, this album widens the turf explored by Charlie Parker and others, but Redman's lyricism stretches the genre even further.
B00992CF6W|5.0|so this game is fricken awesome it automatically updates for you. without messing anything that u may have worked on before being updated. in creative mode you can fly and build with unlimited materials. in survival mode you can do easy-hard and you hav to gather all of you matetials
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Love the new aspects of Quell with the hidden gems.  As are the other two Quell games, this is enjoyable and seemingly never ending.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great graphics good brain teaser more levels are a must. I like that all the rooms are vastly different. Fun
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|My granddaughter loves this film.  She has watched it so many times she does the dialogue!  Always in her travel bag for in the car viewing.
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|This game is cool with a side of some beans. Thought it would be a dumb game but.. turns out it's cool beans.
B00881VLCE|4.0|This ap has a huge variety of great puzzles and lots of them are free. It lets you choose the number of pieces and whether to let them rotate, and you can leave a puzzle and go back later to finish it.<br /><br />I wish the ap would let puzzle pieces go together even when they are not oriented in their final direction, but you have to orient them correctly before you can link them. It also would be great if you could use your own photos or art files xwith it -- maybe future upgrades will do both.<br /><br />My last name is not Lemon now but I can't get Amazon to update the name change for reviews.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|My daughter love the salon but want all the princess but you have to buy them you can't play the game and open up new princess.  That is a bummer for her because all the 3.00 here and there starts to add up fast.
B003UYV08E|4.0|Very good movie - CGI was exceptational!. Plot was way above average, especially for the genre - comic book story.<br /><br />I think it's very hard to do a good super hero story as the basic story is so well known. I would think you would want to add a twist to make it different from the comics but still be true to the well-known storyline.<br /><br />The first Iron Man was great - didn't care too much for the last 3 minutes but otherwise almost a perfect 10. This one was a definite step-down but when you're stepping down from near perfection you're still very, very good.<br /><br />They have taken, to me, a minor-major hero and made him a top-notch hero along with Spiderman! To do this take a deft hand.<br /><br />Picture was superb on my 46 inch LCD. Sound was great! Plot was good - not as good as the 1st but still pretty good. It was nice to see the characters develop over time. Action scenes were way above average (unlike Man of Steel which did the same thing over and over and ....).<br /><br />DVD arrived quickly in perfect shape at a super price.<br /><br />I recommend this - 8.5 to 9.0 out of 10. I would give this 4.5 stars out of 5.
B004SUDPXW|5.0|Very original but it's losing steam.  Each successive season seems to jump a new shark but still better than most of the other crap out there.
B009CF7JDU|5.0|I remember seeing this moving when I was a kid. It always made me jealous that when I would skip school my days were never this exciting. Anytime I see this moving in passing channels I always stop to watch it.
B00BQ1DARM|5.0|Jessie's got a haunting quality to her.  You have to be in the mood to listen or like Enya play it in the background.<br />Definitely recommend it.
0756405890|5.0|I know people will think I'm crazy but I think each book does something different for each person. I've read the greats (Tolkien, Martin, Jordan) and while I LOVE those books this series has just done something to me different than any of those ever did. I have gotten quite a few family members and friends into this series now as well and all are echoing my enthusiasm. Maybe not to my level but all are thoroughly enjoying it. I'm not articulate enough to justify why these books are so great by P. Rothfuss, you just have to check them out. Other reviewers have stated the reasons why and I cannot agree more. I'd give this 10 stars if I could.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I have a 3D Projector with RF glasses.  I project on a 10 foot screen in the living room.  This film is worth every penny!  Best 3D film I own. I will be in line to buy the extended version when it comes out too!

B003UESJJC|5.0|Amazon tends to group reviews with similar products.  To be clear, I am talking about the Blu-Ray Full Disclosure box set.<br /><br />Apocalypse now is a great movie. It is probably the best Vietnam War movie ever made.  Based on Joseph Conrad's novel &#34;Heart of Darkness,&#34; Apocalypse Now tells the story of a soldier who is tasked to hitch a ride on a patrol boat into Cambodia to kill an AWOL US Army Officer who is hiding out somewhere in the jungle.  The patrol boat crew have many an adventure on their way down the river, all the while everyone slowly decays into insanity. Despite the original being filmed in the 1970s, the movie holds up incredibly well. It is quite timeless. I highly recommend watching it if you are a fan of the anti-war type war movies.  &#34;War is hell&#34; is definitely a theme that rings loud. There is a psychological aspect to the film, making it much more surreal than other Vietnam War flicks like &#34;Full Metal Jacket.&#34; However, that is what separates this film from the rest and makes it truly spectacular.<br /><br />This box set itself is good. It also includes the documentary &#34;Hearts of Darkness&#34; which is damn near impossible to find anywhere else. I bought it for $20, and it is worth it.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|So many ways to help you drift into slumber!  Just choose your combination and let the cares of the day float away.
B004INNRFK|5.0|I actually bought this one for my room mate as well. He has not complained about it, so I guess its in good shape.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is really fun game. It is better than temple run 2and1 . I would get this game so do it.
B004ELSDZK|4.0|Neat little game. Connecting the pieces to make 3's. Directions are a bit sketchy and you really have to pay attention, otherwise you're figuring it out as you go.
B00000ADG2|5.0|I don't know why I never purchased this before.  I've always LOVED this CD! This is real & great music.
B0097K21YW|4.0|I like these games that remind people of Angry Birds but put a different spin on things. This is a lot like that...
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|I found things to like more about this album after repeated listenings.  I like Black Gives Way to Blue more than this album for one reason:  There are a lot of songs on this album which feature the \\"chant\\" style of singing, which is cool on a few songs, but gets overused maybe on this one.  What I like about BGWTB over this one is a more straight-forward lead-singer approach.  Duvall has a nice, powerful voice, and I wanted to hear more of it.<br /><br />But, as always, the music is bitchen.  Lately, I've been hearing what Phantom Limb has to offer.  The nuances of songs reach out ot you after a while.  I mostly listen with headphones, and I think that's maybe the best way to get the most from it.  I would also say, the lyrics on this album are more cryptic.  This is still a great album-forget that I am comparing it to BGWTB.
B003XVYLDU|1.0|I'm sorry, but I get all the hype over this book. This is the second time I tried to read it and could only get half way through.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|We (my husband and I) love this movie and the story. We love the challenge it brings to men to be courageous and strong in the Lord. Must see film!<br />(My husband has even been using this theme for the men's ministry at our church and one of the actors is coming to speak at the men's retreat.)
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|I've been waiting for a Queensryche album like this for so long.  After Empire, there had been a decline in quality and the last one... DTC was an absolute insult.  I was looking forward to the 2 versions of Queensryche putting out albums that I'd enjoy.  Geoff Tate's version was horrible (I really thought he had an \\"all star\\" cast that would put something out of value).  Didn't happen.  So, it kinda proves who the problem was the last decade or so.  I do blame the rest of the band for not moving forward sooner.  I do understand Geoff's voice was a main part of the Queensryche sound but nothing in the last 10 years represented the Queensryche I enjoyed. It was probably a hard choice to fire him but the result is a fantastic release that holds its own against earlier albums.  Catchy melodies, great guitar riffs and production is top notch.  Todd's voice is a great fit and not just a copycat of Geoff. Album is kinda short, but to the point.  I'd rather have great, short songs than have the tortured listening experience like F.U.<br /><br />The Real Queensryche is back. Better late than never!
B001HNE3NO|4.0|I would not have known about this book had my sister not recommended it.  I agonized with Amy as she experienced the horrors of war and the guilt and helplessness she felt about her brother.
B00AB0Z88S|3.0|I watched this movie with all the reviews reverberating in my head. I expected to be enthralled and breathless at the end of this amazing movie of survival, with excellent effects. I was not disappointed. The movie met my expectations. But I felt a little disappointed at the ending of the movie, and I'm not sure how to feel about that. I'll need to talk to others to truly understand it.  LIFE OF PI is a wonder to behold, and quite inspirational. Now that I own it, I'm not sure I'll watch it again.  I usually watch the movies I own multiple times. This might be one that I share with family and friends, but never watch again. I just don't think I'd enjoy it the second time around.
B003E74B24|5.0|This I'd the first book I've read about Gordon Ramsey. I was curious to his past and who he is...the man behind the \\"Hell's Kitchen\\" persona. Good read!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Poignant, relative,impassioned and heart wrenching.  Parenting comes with no manuals and so much heart, and the question is raised do we ever truly know the truth?
B00821OX98|5.0|This is a great show.  Was looking for something different to watch and this is it.  I am definitely recommending this to other people.
B00DF0POXA|2.0|I have been a Kanye West fan from the start but I just couldn't follow him with this one.  It was just too, now musical, none skills and more about the beats but that's where it breaks down to me because even the beats are not that good.  Let's be completely honest.  If any other non-known rapper had came out with this we'd be trashing him all over the world.  The people that gave this more than 2 stars are only doing this because his name is Kanye West.  My recommendation.  Save yourself the money and buy T.I.'s album Trouble Man.
0141345659|5.0|I really like this book- and it really did make me laugh and cry. It's not your typical love story- I was pleasantly surprised! :)
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|We enjoyed this in the theater and we have not been disappointed at all in the DVD. It was exactly what it said it was and came quickly. Online is wonderful
B009NPA3MS|4.0|received the cd damaged case fell apart and as the playlist engrained in the case was very annoyed you should replace it as its not fit for purpose
1439181780|5.0|The best Secret book ever!!<br />I have bought all of them and this one is the easiest read and makes so much sense.
B0000067L2|5.0|Start to finish this album is just good.  Lots of variety in the various tunes on this album.  Sure, this album does feature its most famous track (Sunshine of Your Love).  However, the real surprise here is that this album is not just one or two good cuts with a lot of filler.  All the tracks on this album are just fabulous.  I really like Cream anyway and to me, this album just represents the apex of their creativity.  Also, despite the fact that Eric Clapton is Cream's most famous member (and his guitar licks on this album are wonderful), Jack Bruce is just way out front here with his powerful vocals and bass lines and Ginger Baker's drum licks perfectly punctuate each song and keeps everything rocking along.  As the album cover art suggests, it's the blues with purple and pink polka dots to boot.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Before I got this game I was thinking that this game was a child's game but I decided to get it anyway, boy was I wrong. This game really makes you think about solving the escape. I am hooked.
B00A2H9NZY|5.0|Beautiful Northern California coastal setting.  Incredibly balanced storyline showing positive and negative aspects of life.  Great cinematography depicting huge waves and the dangers they create.  A must-see film.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Essential reading for anybody who wants to be free to be who they are really can be. Excellent reading and much more to learn, in the Fifth agreement and apply it toward living with our fellow human beings.
B005DD7H50|4.0|Love Bradley Cooper, love Robert De Niro. So they couldn't go wrong in this movie. It was intriguing because the story hasn't been done before. It makes you think about what you would do if put in a similar situation. The director's style is definitely unique also. All in all, it's worth the time if you're in the mood for something different.
B008K8U13K|4.0|The game is really fun, their one big down side to this game. The control of the game is bad, hopeful they improve the game control.
B00BF11STU|4.0|This was a good movie that makes you feel like you're right there in the middle of things.  I found myself wanting it to move along a little faster...maybe because I knew what the outcome would be.  I enjoyed and recommend the movie but probably wouldn't watch it again.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|May need to watch again to fully gather the director's intent - multiple settings and concepts - very decent performances by the actors
0393339882|5.0|I've always had an interest in physics but do not have the background  (or time) to read the original works by the great early 20th century physicists. I needed a condensed, layman's guide to the theories that shaped the modern world, and this book is it. The science comes alive with clear and understandable descriptions, but even more interesting perhaps are the fascinating personal histories of the brilliant men and women who thought about the nature of matter and reality.  A very enjoyable journey.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was amazing in many ways. It had thought-provoking quotes that really made you think about the meaning of life. I was introduced to this book because I was reading for my summer reading assignment and so all the quotes were great for my double-entry journals. What I also like is that this is not your typical teenage love story. It's more than that. It's not just that Gus has a prosthetic leg or Hazel has horrible lungs. It's that in their time when they were coming to an end, they wound their two lives together and created a loving, caring relationship. One thing I don't understand though is how the couple is far ahead of their age. The way they talk and the words they use. Then I realized, cancer makes you grow fast. Not physically (well maybe, depending on what type of cancer you have) but mentally. For Augustus, he knew his time was coming to an end so he matured quickly. For Hazel, because of her lungs and her oxygen tank, she knew she couldn't be a normal teenager so she became unique in a way. She lived in her own alternate universe that she shared with Augustus. Lastly, I want to say that this book made me cry. Now it takes a lot for me to cry, especially if it's a book. I recommend this book for anyone who likes thinking a lot (philosophers basically). If you like thinking about life and if you enjoy reading simple quotes about life, this is for you. Now let me just say,  THIS IS BOOK IS NOT FOR TEENAGERS ONLY. Don't let the teenage fiction sign confuse you. This book is for both teens and adults as well. For teens, it will show a world different from the ones they usually see every day. They will get to see what real love is. For adults, they can see the world of teens, how it is to live with cancer, etc. Overall, I give this book 5 stars. More in fact, if I could. It was just so good! John Green is an amazing writer. This is so far one of the best books ever!
1451695195|5.0|Believable and fascinating description of the many different levels of God's creation. .He stated that the unconditional love and acceptance he experienced on his NDE journey is the single most important discovery he has ever made. He states that science and spirituality can coexist. &#34;Love is, without a doubt, the basis of everything&#34; and that sharing the very basis message  is the most important task that he has.

B00C7BZYL0|2.0|It's relatively safe to say that there is a strange, disturbing interest that society has taken in the lives of celebrities.  The life of various celebrity personalities is the serious topic of conversation on a daily basis - via television, internet, and any other vehicle of news information.  While the next juicy piece of celebrity gossip borders voyeurism, it still gives us a glimpse of what it's like to live amongst the rich and famous. Celebrity obsession has become so intense in some cases that it has actually been deemed a medical disorder, called celebrity worship syndrome (CWS).  In 2008 and 2009, a group of teenagers became so enthralled with celebrities and their \\"things\\" that they actually Googled celebrity addresses and broke-in to their homes, stealing millions of dollars' worth of clothing, jewelry, and other items.  This group of teenage thieves was a group now known as The Bling Ring.<br /><br />Directed by Sofia Coppola (Lost in Translation), The Bling Ring stars Katie Chang as Rebecca, a fame-obsessed high school student that befriends the new kid in school, Marc (Israel Broussard).  The pair quickly bond over fashion and celebrity obsession, and spend their time ripping off cars, houses, and partying at popular night clubs.  Rebecca and Marc, along with their circle of friends, including Nicki (Emma Watson), Chloe (Claire Julien), and Sam (Taissa Farmiga), decide to start ripping off celebrity houses.  Over the course of a year, the group - known as \\"The Bling Ring,\\" break into the homes of Paris Hilton, Audrina Patridge, Orlando Bloom, and a handful of other A-list celebrities.  Leslie Mann and Gavin Rossdale also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />Initially, The Bling Ring's plot was overshadowed by one of its stars, dubbed the film that \\"Emma Watson sheds her squeaky clean image.\\"  However, the film is much more complex than simply being a film where its star sheds her image.  Still, if you were expecting the former Harry Potter star to take a page out of Vanessa Hudgen's playbook (check out Spring Breakers for details), you'll be severely disappointed - even though she does spend a brief scene with a stripper pole.  In fact, Watson isn't even the main character for the majority of the film, giving way to relative unknowns Katie Chang (Rebecca) and Israel Broussard (Marc), who dazzle and overshadow the Potter alum.  Sadly, as the film progresses, the initial importance of the Rebecca/Marc relationship loses its luster, as the plot shifts to focus more on greed and drug abuse.  The film, which starts with so much potential, loses direction and misses its mark, spending far too much time on Watson's melodramatic attitude and constant application of lip gloss.<br /><br />To be honest, The Bling Ring will leave you with a simple question like, \\"where were the parents during all of this?\\"  The fact that this film is based on actual events is the reasoning behind such a simple question.  It's hard to imagine that coming home at late hours, fat roles of cash in your pocket, and endless amounts of flashy new attire doesn't catch the eye of at least one involved parent (apparently adolescent smoking in your bedroom has never been more innocent).  Regardless, Leslie Mann does in fact portray one involved parent in a film full of teens.  Mann portrays Laurie (Emma Watson's character's mother) in the film, doing her best imitation of a classy Christian parent as she raises her three daughters (even though the whole family is more like devils in sheep's clothing).  Regardless, Mann significantly stands out in her role, shining brightly as the delusional mother encouraging her teenage daughter's desires for Hollywood fame - for all the wrong reasons, of course.<br /><br />Instead of focusing on the critical themes - like society's obsession with looks, fashion, and an ambitious night life - it's much more interesting to focus on all the things wrong and amusing about this film.  For instance, high school teens spendtheir time out-and-about partying in nightclubs `til all hours of the morning?  ...not to mention they're getting bottle service, even though they're underage?  Plus, a DUI on the way home totally isn't a big deal  at all.  Instead, let's focus on the people who aren't smart enough to lock their house or car, and get ripped off for their troubles.  And, why \\"shop where the celebrities shop\\" when you can just let yourself into their house and rip them off instead?<br /><br />Sarcasm aside, this bothersome film paints a dangerous picture of the massively divided and culturally diverse world we live in today.  Speaking of cultural diversity, it wouldn't be right not to mention another film franchise that's chalk full of cultural diversity - The Godfather.  Obviously, it's completely unfair and flat out insulting to compare The Bling Ring to The Godfather, but The Bling Ring is such a waste of a viewing experience that I'm forced to stoop to this level to remind myself that the name Copolla once stood for brilliant filmmaking.<br /><br />In the end, The Bling Ring is nothing more than a satire based on the Vanity Fair article, \\"The Suspects Wore Louboutins\\" by Nancy Jo Sales.  Regardless, meaningful time was wasted blasting Kanye West music and obsessing over inanimate object.  It could have easily been used for character depth, instead of the relentless glorification for the \\"celebrity status.\\"  At the same time, The Bling Ring exudes stupidity, embraces envy, and sends a message that the world's priorities are in a state of disarray.  Despite starting with promise, followed by quickly veering off-course, Emma Watson still attempts to save the flick by doing her best impression of a slutty Christian, aka real-life celebrity robber, Alexis Neiers - who is either a complete simpleton or an evil genius (depending how you look at it, since she obviously got a TV deal out of the whole ordeal). Spoiler alert:  it doesn't work.<br /><br />Final Grade:  D+<br />FNDNreview.comtheir time out-and-about partying in nightclubs `til all hours of the morning?  ...not to mention they're getting bottle service, even though they're underage?

B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Fun, needs better ways to earn items without real money, since as it progresses, some parts can't be completed without real lif  moeny. Wish it were more like the cd rom version but its a fun game nonetheless
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this app. Very clear and animated. I highly recommend this app for all Solitaire lovers. Great way to pass the time.

B008476HBM|4.0|Ms Austen's stories are very good... the characters are interesting and she brings them to life.  However, the quaint language and long complex sentences may make the read too tedious for some.  I am not a speed reader anyway, so it didn't bother me after I got into the first book.  I plan to read them all.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I loved the West Wing series and already had a few seasons but when I saw this set at such a great price, I knew I had to have it.  The presentation is beautiful and far exceeds my expectations.
B00ALYY6ZA|3.0|This is an easy read and a diet that is easy to follow.  Nothing new that we haven't already read in the past.
030758836X|5.0|This novel is easily the best book of 2012. I have read no other novel like it, and I don't expect any one I do read to compare to this one for quite some time. It is incredibly well constructed and developed, and it is such a fast and intense read. I literally could not put it down. I don't want to spoil any of the story for you because that would ruin all of the fun. All I can say is that you will not be let down. Believe the hype, read this novel, you will love it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was a pretty good game. I wish it had been more then 10 levels,but what do you expect for free. None of the rooms sent me running to the Internet for a walkthrough, but I must admit level 10 was the biggest challenge..Defiantly worth the download if you like puzzles.
0439023513|1.0|This book was just abysmal. It felt like Suzanne just wanted to get the book out as quickly as humanly possible, so she wrote this rushed horrible ending to the trilogy. Mockingjay is by far the worst in the trilogy, and possibly one of the worst books I have ever read. The first half was redundant and unnecessary, and when things finally heated up at the end the novel just fizzled out and tried to resolve a thousand plot points in a couple pages. The ending was so rushed and the fate of important characters were barely brushed over in some cases. This book was truly a massive disappointment in every way.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I am absolutely hooked on this game. I have other bingo apps but I play this one the most. It is a nightly ritual.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The acting is superb and the plot is full of surprises already!  It is such a well done show and a glimpse of the 1920's as well.<br />I highly recommend it!
B000VSAEYI|4.0|Our 13 month old LOVES this. The included toys are fun for him and the little perimeter fountains are a nice diversion once you figure out to turn the water down as low as it goes.<br />As for inflation - you are insane to try this without an electric pump or air compressor. I used my air compressor and decreased output pressure to ~20psi and it still took about 15-20 minutes to inflate.<br />Only thing keeping it from 5 stars is that to drain plugs (there are 2 - one in the main pool and one in the slide section) are so close to the corners that the pool only partially drains. You're going to need to pump out the water or get to bailing manually if you want to drain this thing.<br />Overall though it's a great buy and both Mommy and Daddy can fit inside to watch closely while the little guy plays.

Love this book

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is a series that lets you feel like you are right there.  It takes you back in time and you feel a part of that era.  The characters are believable and you always identify with one in particular.  You not only are anxiously awaiting for the next Season, you find yourself listening a 2nd and 3rd time to the ones you have watched. A great gift to give to those who missed out on it.
B002DKGWSE|4.0|I did not like the rape, but the mystery and suspense was very good! It kept me at the edge of my seat. The actors and actressess were good. I thought they could of added more details of the victim being taken to the hospital though. I liked it a lot better than the 1st movie.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I think it is faithful to keeping with the tone of the original and as far as movies go these days it's nice to see a happy ending. Overall it's enjoyable and keeps you entertained. James Franco is woefully out of place in is this role. As an actor his range is limited to  contemporary stuff and he is out of his league for this character. Mila Kunis really nails the evil witch. I have heard criticism of her performance here which is really not justified. She is playing the beats of a well known character and I think any one dimensionality is part and parcel to that character. I don't think you watch a story like this for method acting, it's really about moving the narrative along and the emotional through line so enjoy it for what it is. Michelle Williams has a naturally angelic quality that is well served in her role as Glynda. Kids and adults will enjoy this movie.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think that this app is a lot more fun than Temple run. I had a little difficulty with updating it though. So over all its a very fun game.

B00BHMETKC|5.0|This was definitely thinking outside the box. Great story and well told. I'm glad the USA could finally take credit for something positive.
B001ANSSDC|2.0|*may contain spoilers*<br /><br />I'm sorry, but this book honestly just kind of sucked. I expected much better from a book with such glowing reviews. I did not see the movie, as I'm a girl who likes to read the book before seeing the movie. Based on this book, I now have zero interest in the movie (as much as I love Jennifer Lawrence). No thanks.<br /><br />The book was boring. Point blank, period. I was intrigued at first, wanting to know what the secret with Nikki was. I thought for a bit that she might be dead or something, and Pat didn't remember. I don't know. But I found myself skipping through pages and pages of utterly uninteresting crap about sports so I could find out where the heck the story was headed. Then that weirdo character, Tiffany? I did not comprehend how she came to fall in love with Pat. Maybe I missed it among all the redundant sports drivel I had to skip through? It also really does not explain Pat's mental state well at all, and I found his character pretty annoying. He beats up the guy his wife is boning, and somehow winds up in a mental institution for four years? Makes no sense. I reached the ending, only to find that it was lame. Really lame. Sorry to use such juvenille language, but it was just bad. Don't bother reading this. I'm giving this two stars for the wasted potential this book could have had.
B000FBJF3M|5.0|Even though I knew what was ultimately going to happen - the novel was full of suspense and intrigue.  It was fascinating to follow the events through the eyes of the water engineer from Rome. Have been recommending this book to everyone.
B00D3V85FA|5.0|Amazing!! After all those years!! The more you listen the better it gets! Great drummer from Rage Against the Machine! Tony Iommi is on top of his game in my opinion! The Old Black Sabbath is Back!<br /><br />Reebeci
B00915G6WQ|4.0|I've loved Dexter since the first episode of season one.  This season is also good but some of the situations are getting a bit hard to believe.  There was that cliff-hanger at the end of season six that made you want to watch this season and, true to form, there is a cliff-hanger at the end of this season too.  I won't tell you what it is, you'll have to watch it for yourself.  I hated to see Monk end after &#34;only&#34; eight seasons but I think they did the right thing in pulling the plug before it jumped the shark, maybe the folks at Dester should consider ending it in one, or two at the most, more seasons.  This DVD is worth the price, especially if you already have the other seasons of Dexter.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|For me characters are the story and this books is character-rich.  Don't, don't, don't I told them.  But they went their own way, I didn't want to stop reading about where they would end up.  Some people complain that it is like a collection of short stories.  If so, they are great short stories and they add up to a wonderful whole novel of inexorable time and the loss and wonders it brings year-by-year.  The author grows with each book and brings me insights to a people I'll never know completely but human beings -- including myself -- I know intimately.  I loved both his previous books.  Although I rarely buy new books I will again be on the waiting list to receive his next.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|Our family loved this movie, It's outstanding, bright colors, the story was right on, the kids loved the way it started, it was almost like the wizard of oz

B007FEFLTO|4.0|This was an excellent read!!  All of the characters were perfectly entertwined.  I could not put the book down.,  It is a shame we have to wait so long for the next book.

1608871827|5.0|It was great, wonderful pictures and insights for the movie, can't wait to see it at the theater! The book is divided into three area's the monsters, robots, and scenes.
B00CO8D3G4|2.0|I wanted to like this book, really. Its well written, funny in places, but meandering, repetitive and in need of strong editing. Apparently self-publishing must mean self-editing too, not a good combination. Choosing yourself is the mantra with little substance ... but I don't want to reject the author because much of the book is about rejecting Rejection. And living healthy. And sleeping enough. And not wasting time on Internet trolls. Like me. Jim, I read your book. I want my money back.

0062255657|4.0|I have always loved Neil Gaiman.  I first discovered him in my early twenties, when I picked up his Sandman graphic novels (which are still my all-time favorite comics).  He has this unique way of seeing the world, and expressing his observations about life.  His style is quirky and his thoughts profound. His world view resonates with me.<br /><br />The Ocean at the End of the Lane is a children's story, with an adult message.  The sense that this was a children's book put me off initially, but after a few pages, I found myself drawn into the world of the sad, lonely boy narrating the story.  His first childhood chapter opens with this line: &#34;Nobody came to my seventh birthday party.&#34;  Right then and there, my heart went out to him.  He's a shy child, without many friends, who does well in school, and finds shelter in the books he loves.  His family lives in a quiet community where nothing much happens, until a series of odd circumstances change everything.  A man commits suicide, while others experience unusual financial luck.  Our narrator (I'm not sure if he is ever named) befriends a young girl from down the lane, and together they investigate the cause of the upsets in their world.  Their investigation opens a doorway that pulls something darkly magical into their existence, which slowing begins destroying our narrator's family.  It's up to him to find the strength to fight back against this force, and save his family.<br /><br />Yes this is a children's book, but hidden under the whimsical, fairy tale elements, is a theme that is very adult: The Ocean at the End of the Lane deals with issues of helplessness and abuse in childhood.  Our narrator consistently feels powerless when facing the adult forces in his life.  He is unable to fight his father's rage, his mother's absence, and the nanny who isolates him and takes away all of his freedoms. There's a particularly terrifying scene where his father holds his head under in the bath, trying to drown him.  Through this abuse, this poor child is powerless.  He's too weak to fight back; too afraid to tell anyone, there are times when the only out he can see is death. Sadly, since he's just a child, with all the adaptability that comes with youth, part of him accepts what's happening to him as just part of the new norm for his life.  He finds escape in books, and aid from the magic of the women at the end of the lane.  Whether or not those women were figments of an abused child's mind is up to the reader to determine. I'm not sure what Mr. Gaiman's childhood was like, but this story truthfully portrays the realities of childhood abuse. I think anyone that has suffered something similar in childhood, will find this story resonates with them.<br /><br />It is natural when one is reading the story about a sad lonely boy to hope he's rise up, and conquer the forces that hurt him, and find his happily ever. In my mind, the nanny and the dad had to go.  I wanted to see the boy take up a mighty sword of justice and smite the nanny, and then reveal his father for the ultimate shmuck he was.  I wanted his mother to curb stomp her cheating, abusing husband, and pack up her kids and start a new life. I wanted the boy to grow up and marry Lettie Hempstock and vacation in magical and fantastical lands beyond the Ocean.  Sadly only one of my wishes came partly true.  Evil does not triumph in this story, but don't expect happy endings.  A poor, sad boy grows up to be a sad and somewhat lonely man, with a failing marriage, and a hole in his heart.  It was realistic, and beautiful, but it left me feeling sad.  I guess I want my fiction to give me the happy endings we don't experience in real life.<br /><br />The Ocean at the End of the Lane is the type of story that changes you.  It makes you look at the world with different eyes, if only for a little while.  Gaiman has a talent for writing this sort of story.  The words written on these pages will remind you of what it's like to be seven, and to see the world for all of its beautiful and terrible possibilities.  It will remind of a basic truth you may have forgotten over the years - that magic can be found even in the most banal of circumstances, you just have to look  hard enough for it.<br /><br />&#34;I do not miss childhood, but I miss the way I took pleasure in small things, even as greater things crumbled. I could not control the world I was in, could not walk away from things or people or moments that hurt, but I found joy in the things that made me happy.&#34;beautiful and terrible possibilities.

0091937388|5.0|The book is very, very good. However the movie is very-very-very good, one of those rare circumstances wherein the director and screenwriters really understood the material, and were adept enough to translate a book to cinema. This is a tribute not only to the director and screenwriters, but also to Forsyth, who intentionally stuffed a good tale with narrative visuals that would translate well to the screen.<br /><br />Like most people these days, I came to the book after seeing the film multiple times. Very little of the essential story was left out of the film. There were minor place and name changes. For example, the gunsmith in the book is in Belgium, not Genoa; the gun-testing is in the Ardennes, not in Lombardy. The homosexual pickup in the book is in a Paris gay bar, not in a Turkish bath, as in the movie. The attempted assassination at the end is in Montparnasse, not near Notre Dame. Kovalsky is abducted in the Marseilles airport, not in a carpet in Genoa. The fake English passport is for Alexander Duggan, not Paul Oliver Duggan. And so on.<br /><br />But the book brings detail to a couple of characters who were fully fleshed-out in the original, though abstracted in the film. One is Kovalsky, the ex-Legionnaire, who is abducted in the book when he attempts to see his sick daughter in France. Another is the Baronne,  the Jackal's unfortunate lover, who had a huge history during Resistance times, and is a very lively and lusty woman (unlike the version in the film).<br /><br />The novel gives us a firmer grasp on the place and time of France in the early 1960s. Such trivia as the suspicion between DeGaulle and the British government, a scant few months after DeGaulle blackballed the UK from the Common Market, help to fill out the foreign-policy tension that inevitably is glossed over in the movie.<br /><br />Finally, knowing the film makes one appreciate the richness of the two lead characters: Lebel the detective, and the Jackal himself. Forsyth gave us so much in the book that the movie could only have worked if these two people had been cast perfectly, with the bumbling, self-effacing Anglo-French actor Michel Lonsdale, and the handsome, stuffy, reticent Edward Fox. The book and film both give us full value, and that's why both film and book are classics.uch in the book that the movie could only have worked if these two people had been cast perfectly, with the bumbling, self-effacing Anglo-French actor Michel Lonsdale, and the handsome, stuffy, reticent Edward Fox.

1849025975|5.0|I listened to the non-audible audiobook version of this book narrated by Patrick Tull so I will comment on that at the end of this review.<br /><br />4¼ stars.<br /><br />I usually enjoy the more intense and grittier war memoirs but I just couldn't pass this up. For one thing it is written by a brilliant author! The other thing is that it is from a conflict (the Spanish Civil War) that features relatively few memoirs with respect to the other conflicts that blemished the landscape of the first half of the 20th century.<br /><br />And so I went into this memoir expecting a lot of political musings and little details in terms of combat. I was right, but I need to qualify: When Orwell does go into politics it still is interesting and well written but most of all he flat out says to skip the chapter if you're not into that stuff and just want a more straight-forward memoir. As to the latter expectation, Orwell still writes what he goes through with clarity, eloquence and intrigue. His description of charging a fascist outpost and having grenade duels was amazing!<br /><br />His discussion of the conditions of the army and the interesting make up of an army featuring anarchists, socialists, communists and FSM knows what else is first rate.<br /><br />This is why I gave this book a 5 star rating officially, though a 4¼ stars in terms of intensity and grittiness along with combat.<br /><br />As to the audiobook, I don't think the one I heard is offered on Audible unfortunately. Patrick Tull does a great job! I love his voice and the passion and emotion he reads with, I am gonna check for more work by him as well.<br /><br />This book should of course be read by fans of Orwell but it should read by those interested in war memoirs and those interested in the Spanish Civil War!
1623420148|5.0|Before it was released I heard many blogs raving about Tangled. Once it came out I made sure to read it and let me say it did not disappoint. It's a great book and I love how it was written.
B000P5FH3K|4.0|I'm a huge fan of Matt Damon and this was one of his early movies that I did not have. Of course John Grisham is a great author and this movie is exciting and intense.
B005ZMTAXQ|4.0|With a group of new characters and a TON of Buzz action, my son cannot get enough of this movie! It is a family favorite.

B001HN6922|5.0|My grandson watches it alot it's a good movie.I've seen it almost as much as he has.It's a most have for kids of all ages
B002ZG999U|5.0|I came to this party late; about 2 1/2 years late. I didn't see it in the theatre because I thought Stallone was over the hill. Boy was I wrong. Just when you think that \\"Rocky\\" was down and out he gets up and throws a knockout punch. This movie was Awesome!! Stallone creates yet another character and he brings all of his friends along. There is so much testosterone here that it literally explodes off of the screen. I am not going to get into specifics because there is no need to. Just see the darn thing. You'll be exhilarated; and that is not an exaggeration.
B00005JNS0|5.0|We have watched this movie so many times my grandson knows what going to happen nexts. Still will watch it everyday if you let him.I really like the movie too.
B00D3V85FA|4.0|This album is pretty much exactly what I had hoped for when I heard that the old Sabbath was reuniting for one more album.  Its dark, heavy and plodding, and Ozzy's lyrics and vocals are great.  Timely songs and ones with classic Sabbath themes fill this album, which flows from one song to the next easily.  This album is a must get for any Sabbath fan.
B008AWBQGM|5.0|I am newly introduced to this band. I love this album. I always lime acoustic albums but I keep playing this one several times a week.
B008EKOIN8|3.0|I've read Pollan's previous books, and the last few were both a good personal story and an insightful look into the world of how modern people eat.  'Cooked' follows that same theme but with less urgency.  As I read through I was interested in Pollan's journey, but by the end I found myself not caring as much as I had in previous books.  I think part of this is due to the length of the book, which felt like it could have been tighter.  Overall, an interesting read, and if you are a Pollan fan like myself or a foodie go ahead a read it, but I wouldn't recommend this to everyone out there.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Very fun and relaxed game. I just started so I I don't know about much of the game but for the experience I have at this time It is a pretty good game.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Game was very fun and easy to play. Wish there were more like it!! Hope to see many more out there.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I read this novel shortly after seeing the movie which I loved. I had no idea the film was based on a book after I saw it. It was a great novel that had a lot of depth and was very touching.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|The acting was well done and the accuracy of the material seemed to be on target.  I give this movie an attaboy.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I've rarely met a book I could so easily identify with. The characters in this book leapt off the page for me. It is a book I will read over again. This is not just for young adults and teens - it is for everyone but it is especially for anyone who has struggled alone.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I ordered this mouse about two months ago and I really do love it.  It has so many options to customize and it just works amazing.  The only thing I can say I didn't like when I first received it was that the scroll button was a little lower then I was used to, but after about a week, I didn't even notice it anymore.  I am in love with this mouse and I hope it lasts a long time.<br /><br />As for using it while gaming, the buttons on the side, next to the thumb, can be customized as well which allows for easier access in certain things, in my opinion.<br /><br />Great mouse.  The end.
B00AZMFO6I|2.0|I thought reading the reviews I would like it because it says it's inspirational, I found it to lack substance and very limited, considering the talant, it was dissapointing in my opinion.  There were a lot of sexual innuendos supposedt to be funny but it was too much (a stroke supposedly caused the old man to do this) but he had a big part and ms. Smith had  a big part but overall the film lacked any depth under utilizing the talant of these actors.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|If you're here, you likely already know about Game of Thrones and like it enough to consider buying it.<br /><br />What are you waiting for?
B00AREIAI8|1.0|Rate begging and bribery!  My daughter loves feeding the horse and grooming it, but the gem issue is irritating. I would rather have the option of paying for the app and everything just costing coins than for the gem money grab.<br /><br />Update:  Constant advertisements are sucking any pleasure out of this game.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|this is the only app I can find that has a nice mellow river/stream. All the others mix too much like birds chirping and wind
B0000AM6IY|5.0|How do you spell great- West Side Story!<br />Movie luster is still there after all these years, everything about this musical movie is just so awesome. I go through the house humming \\"Maria\\" and all the other fabulous songs from this delightful movie. It will always be at the top of my favorite movie list and how I felt when I was 12 and watched it for the first time, greatness doesn't die, it keeps playing oon over & over & over.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|It was very, well acted and had a good story so over all I would say it was<br /> good or better
0736092269|5.0|Illustrations were great!  It helped me program some of my workouts for athletes with different ideas for some exercises. Could be great for PTs since there are great pictures of muscle groups.
B0095P3ULC|3.0|Enjoy the picture quality of the movie. Would watch it again. Glad it was a free movie and easy to get connected to.
1590171993|5.0|I saw Stoner's wife as completely believable.  Married life must have been just like that 100 years ago...husband and wife ignorant of what to do about how miserable they were.  They stuck together and tortured themselves and one another.  It's somehow a perfect story.  Stoner says he notices his daughter drinks a lot during one of her visits and he says at least she has that.
0316113514|4.0|Was happy that the book shipped quickly and that i could get it in paperback. Thank you. As soon as  I finish it I will be ordering another book.
B00AJAFNIA|2.0|I don't usually review games and apps because people seem to love reviewing them, but this time I make an exception.<br /><br />This game is really great. Not only did I love it, but so did my wife. We are not ones to finish games often, but this one was so compelling that we tried and tried and tried again and we both finally beat the game!<br /><br />REVIEW UPDATE: Since I have learned about the intrusive analytics being used by the devs that reveal too much of my personal information, I have reduced my previous high rating to a two-star rating. It's a shame too. We really did love that game, but no-one should have their privacy so amazingly invaded just on a silly game.
B000003CMC|4.0|While listening to this classic album I'm reminded of my age all I can say it still is as fresh as it was 40 years ago.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|City of Bones was highly recommended by my middle school students who loved Hunger Games and Divergent.This book has many of the same qualities of a strong female protagonist with action to keep you wanting to read more. It has a few surprises that will keep you guessing and wanting to read the next book in the trilogy.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|loved the challenge! fun and had to think just enough to keep me interested. can't wait to play the next few rounds!
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|OK.  The disguise isn't really that good because I'm sure you won't be buying it for the entertainment value alone.  But it is entertaining, it is instructional and it is motivating.  You will want to read it again and then look at your own habits and workplace procedures to see what can be improved.  Recommended.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I like it cause it feels like I'm actually in ponyvillen.best game ever!I also like it cause now u get to go to canterlot^^ish sho Awsome!!!
B00006JIA4|5.0|I bought this the day I was leaving for my grandparents, I bought the mp3 and CD version. I listened to it the whole way there, (11 hours) and I never got tired of the music, and when the CD came it was in perfect condition!
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|Kanye re-invented the wheel from college dropout to graduation to 808s to dark twisted and now to yeezus. I actually enjoyed his other albums so much more, i had a better connection with the beats on those albums and felt his lyrics really came from within. most lyrics of the new album seemed pieced together without as much thought. it looks like he could have taken way too much crack recently because when he's clean, i'm sure he will feel the same way as well.<br /><br />please release another album next year!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I don't want to give away anything but basically the fault in our stars is about two teens in love, but they know their time is short because of cancer. I started reading this book Yesterday evening, and being the kind of 13 year old book worm I am, I didn't stop reading until I finished....at 1:30 in the morning. And I don't usually cry over fiction but this book made me sob into my pillow for the last like 7 chapters or so ( and i had to be very quite because my parents were asleep and I didn't want to wake them). This is gonna sound cheesy but after I finished, I kind of started thinking of the world differently. It really opened me up to the struggle cancer victims go through. This was one of the best books I have ever read and if you are debating on whether or not you should read TFIOS i strongly suggest you do. You won't regret it!
B003J5UIRS|5.0|The stories in this book are really interesting and I enjoyed reading how reincarnation seems to be the only logical explanation. I think Dr. Tucker spends a little too much time discussing every. single. other. thing. that it could possible be (I get it, he doesn't want to seem like a quack), but I still enjoyed the scientific look at the issue.
1439153663|4.0|the ending.  I know life doesn't turn out all sunshine and roses, but I was very disappointed in the ending of this book.  Overall, a good, easy read, just be prepared for not the best of endings.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I like the way the story lines immerse the attorney/housewife into unfamiliar scenarios. Her creativity and wits more than compensate for her lack of experience. Juliana Marguiles plays her part with skill.
B003RNZFRK|5.0|I love this CD. Great music and AWESOME, AWESOME COVER. It's like they read my mind with the cover . . .  :-)<br /><br />If you love the Chicago Blackhawks as much as I do, get the entire album. You'll get Chelsea Dagger in the album as well. The Fratellis are a Scottish band and at times, it sounds like the Beatles are singing, minus the obsessive fan named Yoko.  ;-) Enjoy.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Nice game  it keep you interested and wanting more  challenging levels  I hope a new version of this game would comr soon
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Enjoyable. It is easy to become additive to this game. It needs more levels. I could not put down my tablet till I worked the puzzle out. Then, I had to do the next puzzle.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|excellent thought exercise. it maintains a challenging format without giving a feeling of being overwhelmed or too difficult. very addictive
B000BGH2CM|3.0|Most matches are good here, especially the triple threat main event and the Kurt Angle/Eddie Guerrero match was great. However, there are some very terrible matches here as well. Goldberg/Brock Lesnar was possibly the worst Wrestlemania match of all time, and Kane/Undertaker 2 was a huge letdown. Overall its worth a buy though. I would give the overall show a 7 out of 10.
B0094M2Z9O|5.0|I have seen Bridge on the River Kwai many times for the past 45 yrs. I saw it in the theater when I was a kid. Then I didn't understand it, as I do now.  I watch it when I feel like an old movie with great actors, reminiscing, and whistling.<br />My favorite saying in this movie is &#34;Be Happy In Your Work&#34;, been using it for years. Unfortunately it was used as torture in the movie, but it stuck in my mind.<br />If you watch this award winning flic I'm sure you will enjoy it, as I have.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|liked the movie from start to finsh one of the best films ever.<br />we sew it 3 time and would watch it again.
B0026IUXO2|5.0|She has always been one of my favorite Queens of England. She was powerful and had no problem take care of her throne, and I admire the fact that see saw that all the people should know god un like the Vatican which I see as heretic's, idolater's, worshipers of Mary, who was blessed AMONG women but as no power in heaven. Jesus died on the cross and to him only do we go in prayer.<br /> But than only God knows the true heart of his children.  Sorry I got out of control.
0061767581|4.0|I ordered the first to books of this series because I was going away on a trip and I wanted to bring both because I knew I would finish the first one half way through and I wanted to be able to continue right away on the next book. The first book came in a timely fashion. It came mid order date which is great. But I thought it was weird that my second book had not arrived since I had ordered them at the same exact time. I e-mailed them and they were great they refunded my money. But I am sad my second book never arrived. I wish I would have been contacted if there was a problem with the second book so I could have ordered it from another place so I would have had it for my trip.
B00899E5B4|5.0|The lyrics are smart and fun. Melodies are enjoyable. Walsh voice and guitar never better. This is how I like rock. Even my 21 year old son really likes the melodies and lyrics. He would also give the album 5 stars.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|Sanderson weaves an intricate magic system and story that leaves you wanting more. Its a delightful quick read for any fantasy enthusiast.
B003Y8YXH6|3.0|Lennon's songs in general are very good. Yoko's are for the most part childish and almost unlistenable,though not as shrill as on &#34;Milk and Honey&#34;.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|The new CD by Queensryche simply self titled presents a band on a mission to cross back over to the mainstream. It's neither nostalgic or 'prog' the generic genre some people attempt to give bands like Marillion or Queensryche/Pink Floyd/Rush ect. Sadly Prog can meld in with 'Classic Rock' suddenly youre in Classic Rock Magazine, played on classic metal stations, or viewed as 'Progressive' 'thinking mans metal' So many classifications, with little room to breathe. For that reason the only down part of the CD's release is it may be marketed to the 'Blabbermouth' and 'classic metal' crowd a little too much.<br /><br />It is a reboot of a once great band, and a huge step in the right direction to see the group back in the public eye, with a new singer, that could bring the band back to the top of the charts, instead of 'preaching to the choir' the only thing that may hold the CD back would be the 'classic rock' label. Marillion, to an extent had that problem, moving on from their former singers 'era' of the band, and going ahead with Steve Hogarth.<br /><br />After hearing and reviewing this album for a different metal website, I can honestly say 'get these guys out of the freakin casino/fair/smaller theater circuit, quit having hair metal bands from the 80's/.90's on the same lineup, and move these guys 'forward' into the future. That IS the definition of 'progressive' isn't it?<br /><br />Todd La Torre has done wonders for the band already and the CD proves it! Personally though, a tour with Paramore, Anberlin, Killswitch Engage, Atreyu, Cobra Starship, or even MGMT would be a much better idea. Animal Collective anyone? I think fans of these bands might really dig Queensryche. Especially the new record.<br /><br />I think I would've felt better seeing their tour manager completely on a mission to reinvent these guys as a new act, instead of a 'classic band' sure they've been around for 30 years, but currently this lineup is going through a renaissance with a hit album, whereas people like Slaughter havent made one since the early 2000's 'Back to Reality' or others like Journey who are quoted that they're probably done making CD's, or Don Dokken proclaiming their recent CD is their last. DUDE, really?<br /><br />Queensryche with Todd is proof if you make a great CD, people will buy it! Not rocket science. I would love to see this record appeal to a young crowd, the way Empire and Mindcrime did back in the 80's/90's. But for Heavens sake...this is 2013. This is a re-boot of an amazing band. And a 5 star album!<br /><br />I don't hear anything on this record thats 'classic rock' 'proggy' or the 90 other labels this band is given.<br /><br />In the end, like Marillion, there's gonna be a 'Tate-era' like there's a 'Fish-era Marillion.' Does  that mean Marillion can't have hit songs in 2013? Their new CD 'Sounds that Cant Be Made' was extremely well received, and Fish continues to tour playing the same old 'Misplaced Childhood' album live for his fans. As Tate is STILL doing Operation Mindcrime live. Ugh.<br /><br />I'm excited for whatever CD this band releases post November court date. When we get the 'real' 'non-court date' 'non war with Tate' album. They have room to breathe, and room to grow. But Good God, quit booking them with hair metal bands. If you're gonna do a 'rebooot' really go it full circle. Your album sales will triple!

B001KDQ4KQ|1.0|This story didn't grab me. I skipped over quite a bit of the courtroom drama and so forth...Then, after reading enough to figure out what was really going on here, I didn't buy that Emily had all these problems and eventually killed herself just because some freak felt her up when she was a little kid. Also, the facts given in the book are all the reader has to go on.  I refuse to take on the job of guessing what happened and coming to my own conclusions.<br /><br />I like to be told a story; that's why I read a book.  Please don't make me have to fill in all the blanks.<br /><br />I thought it was going to be a big big thing, like her father molesting her to find out she was having his baby, or Chris's father touching her....(which many reviews were guessing and wondering and concluding because they all had similar thoughts to mine.)<br /><br />Something as big as a mountain, horribly evil and ridiculously monumental.<br /><br />Not this.<br /><br />I just didn't buy it.  These two families were very close.  Eventually, Emily would have told her mother or a high school friend about the creepy dude at Micky Dee's....but no. If the author MEANT for us to think more happened to Emily, then just write it...<br /><br />She pushes away her love....her best friend since they were babies.<br />Good Lord, if you couldn't confide in Chris, then maybe you were doomed girl.<br /><br />While I certainly would never brush off a dirty perverted man  putting his hands on a little girl, the incident wasn't strong enough to warrant Emily's behavior throughout the years afterwards. Many might disagree.  Go ahead.<br /><br />I'm sure some would argue that even the tiniest thing could mess up the rest of someone's life and lead to death, but not me; not the way this was presented.<br />Like I said, if you want the reader to think her father or neighbor molested her as well, come right out and say it.  Chris's baby? (Remember, they used a condom) Someone else's kid?  Author doesn't say, so I'm going by the facts presented; not supplying my own and writing the story myself.<br /><br />While the writing was good, I just didn't think this was believable.<br /><br />This was one of those books you wanted to hurry through so you could move on to read a \\"good\\" book.<br /><br />Also, there's a big mistake in the kindle version.  The entire first chapter was printed twice.  I thought I had accidentally moved the slider.<br />Very confusing.  This should be fixed.so I'm going by the facts presented; not supplying my own and writing the story myself.<br /><br />While the writing was good, I just didn't think this was believable.<br /><br />This was one of those books you wanted to hurry through so you could move on to read a \\"good\\" book.<br /><br />Also, there's a big mistake in the kindle version.

B00CM9JKQM|5.0|This is a very good album, the sound is back, great songs!<br />There is no need to talk about the two Queensryche bands anymore, which one is the original and which one is not, stop the arguing because the truth has been revealed, it's not the name what matters it's the music!!!!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was reminded of reading Mark Twain as a young lad, the authors fluid style and vivid descriptions, especially of the action scenes, draws you in like few others can.  What I missed were the more prosaic descriptions of the environment, most of the text is invested in creating and resolving tension, foreshadowing more tension, on and on.  That's what makes it read so well, I understand, but there is ample opportunity to pause and say, let us know more about colors, smells, sounds, vibrations, textures.  It would flesh out this world to know for instance, the dimensions of the silos, and more on the environment.  Sure some of this was intentionally left out, and yes the characters have clear motivations and are brilliantly described.  By the way, don't get too attached to any one character, they drop like flies in the first four books.<br />Loved this book, and I an highly impressed with the authors attitude toward self publication.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|This is an amazing game. It is addictive and challenging. The kids I babysit love it and it stimulates their minds!

B007VUA7VO|5.0|I use this app to check the battery level on my android, kindle fire, and my kindle fire hd. You can set it at what battery level you want to be alerted by the device voiceover at wheather it's charging or discharging. It also takes you to the Battery HD app when you connect the kindle or android device to start charging. It saves you on the long run and saves time by batt level display in the notifications bar instead of searching the device to see its charge level. I highly recommend the app especially for your kindle device and all the Kindle Fire models.

B0050DIWFC|3.0|Firstly, the ending lead you to believe that Jacob was indeed a murderer.  But it never said outright whether he was or not.  I like endings that are more straight forward.<br />There was too much ambiguity in this story..  Why did Jacob not display any signs of his cruelty or attitudes towards other people to his parents? He was not a likeable person at all, and it was hard to root for him at any point in the story.  You certainly want to believe a teenage boy is innocent of murder.<br />I just did not develop any feeling towards his parents either really.

B003XWEQ1G|5.0|I never thought any film could surpass Errol Flynn's &#34;The Adventures of Robin Hood&#34;, but this adaptation with Russell Crow proved me wrong, and how glad I am that it did!  :)  Whenever I Really like a movie, or its actors, I always BUY, not rent, the DVD.  Now I have a perfect set of &#34;bookends&#34; with these two stories of the legendary hooded outlaw (forget the one with Kevin Costner - what a disaster!), and will enjoy watching them again and again.<br /><br />Both are Perfect in every way! :D

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have read a lot of Sci-fi in my life, so it takes a lot to keep me interested and engaged. Hugh Howey's Wool Omnibus was a great pleasure to read and held my interest throughout and beyond. I can't wait for his next installment. The characters were well-developed, the plot was engaging, the action kept moving. Readers will not be disappointed. It's so much more than a post-apocalyptic tale. There are plenty of mediocre novels out there on this subject but this is NOT one of them!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is a great game .it makes you look in every place you would least likely look in. This game is a game that can also stump you.
B000TERG6S|5.0|Nothing I can write will illustrate what a quick listen to ANY of Jesse Cook's recordings will do for your Spirit.  I first heard his music playing in the background of a beautiful art gallery in Mystic, MA.  (yes, the town with the pizza.)  I stopped in my tracks, closed my eyes, exhaled, and swooned.<br /><br />Since that time I have purchased every one of this wonderful musicians work.  When I need a break, he takes me to tropical islands, when I am blue, he awakens my spirit, when I am indifferent I put on his CD and am filled with the passion of Life once again.  Such a small price for such a sumptuous reward!

B00992CF6W|4.0|Ok, well I downloaded this app about 4 months ago. It was version 1.6.1, which was too bad. But about two weeks ago VERSION 1.7.1 came along! Its AMAZING! So much better, you can spawn animals in creative and get water or lava buckets. It could be better though. Add EVERYTHING THE XBOX VERSION HAS! Which most inportanly includes Squid, Redstone,Pressure Pads, Silver Doors, Switches, and Spawn Dogs/ Wolf!  But for now 4/5 stars. UPDATE!

B0089LOG02|5.0|This was a wonderful Novel based on the actual Orphan Trains. (Between 1854 and 1929, so-called orphan trains ran regularly from the cities of the East Coast to the farmlands of the Midwest, carrying thousands of abandoned children whose fates would be determined by pure luck. Would they be adopted by a kind and loving family, or would they face a childhood and adolescence of hard labor and servitude?) The two main characters are an older woman, Vivian, who had been one of the orphans sent on the Orphan Train,  and ended up in Minnesota, in a couple of different homes. The other main character  a young teenage girl, Molly, who herself has been in foster care most of her life. The two come together as Molly who needs to do community-service helps Vivian go through her attic and as they look through her keepsakes and possessions, they find a sort of common ground. The book goes back and forth from Vivian's life in the 1920's through present day and Molly's story in present day. Beautifully written and a very interesting story of these trains, and what these children had to endure.

B00AB7HESI|5.0|this is the best game I have ever played it is so worth buying you can create the things you Wright in your notebook
B006LSZECO|2.0|I think part of the problem is all of the hype surrounding this book.  It was described as 'smart and savy' with 'cunning plot twists'.  That raised my hopes and expectations.<br /><br />Not to be funny, but if you have even half a brain, you will see EVERY plot twist coming from MILES away.  I think if you're very young, or just haven't read very many books - you'll probably enjoy this.  But if you're even slightly well read you'll just feel like you've wasted a number of hours of your life on reading this that would have been better spent doing something else.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book is incredible. Martin continues to do an masterful job of developing his characters and weaving together the various story lines.  The plot is full of twists and turns as usual and true to his word, whenever you think you know what's going to happen, you're probably wrong. Can't wait for Winds of Winter.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is fun, addictive and challenging.  Lots of fun.  Look forward to more levels.  Tests your memory skills.  Recommend to everyone.

B0020BUWX2|5.0|This is one of the greatest books I have ever read. Although it can be sad in parts and it is truly inspiring. And it leaves you wondering do we really get to choose whether we go or it we stay.
B00A8MGLAI|4.0|The frequent jumping from time and place to other times and places/characters was very confusing but it was an enjoyable film never-the-less. Suggest watching the extras to get a feel on how and why the time/place/person jumps take place in the film and the whole thing makes logical sense from that point on. Third time through watching far more enjoyable than the first.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've tried tons of keyboards and SwiftKey is by far the best! If someone knows a better one I will challenge them :-)

As an avid fan of Edguy and Avantasia since the beginning I have been very dissapointed with the last few offerings from Edguy and now from this album.  I won't be buying any more of either.  Comparatively I absolutely LOVE Circus Maximus's new album Nine which I bought at the same time so not a complete waste of money!

You have to watch closely, or you'll miss some of the quick ones they run past you. Anyway, if you just want to sit down and do a lot of laughing at a movie, this one is a great starter--I recommend it highly.

B0043RSK3K|5.0|Stone and Kuznick state right in the Introduction that our country has done much good in the world, but we already know about that. Their purpose is to document our less creditable actions, the stuff that our Fearless Leaders and their academic & journalistic sycophants don't want us to know.<br /><br />Much of the material in the book has already been covered by Chomsky and the late, great Howard Zinn. But Stone & Kuznick are better writers.<br /><br />If you're at all interested in what's been done to us, and to others in our name, this book will inform you.
B00B0NDQPC|5.0|It is one of my favorite CD--She has a beautiful voice and I can understand every word she sings unlike most of the modern vocalists.  I hope she continues to do more of the old standards.

B00CXL6XP0|5.0|I have been a Queensryche fan since that day in 1983 when my best friend ran to my house and said \\"Man you have to listen to this new band\\" The song was Queen of the Ryche..WOW. Since then I have been a fan. However, over the last 15 years I have been wondering where the creativity had gone. When I would see them in concert the guys just did not look happy. Well I think the world now knows why.  I wish Geoff Tate well. He was a member of a band that gave me many great memories and was once one of the best vocalists not just in Metal but in music. But let's be honest, the once great voice that rocked me to my core is gone and he was dragging the name Queensryche down. The albums of the last 15 years were HORRIBLE.  Then that JOKE of a cabaret tour was the finally straw.  Getting Todd in this band was a breath of fresh air.  This album is great!  Tate could not have sung on this album. He just does not have the range anymore. Every song on this album is great.  In The Light, Spore and A World Without are my personal favorites but make no mistake this is a complete album. All the tracks are great.  The only issue I have with this album is that it is too short. It leaves me wanting more and maybe that was the point.  I am happy to hear that they are already writing songs for the next Queensryche album.....this band is Queensryche!!!!!!! Also if you have not seen them in concerts you need to when they come to your town. To hear the classics from the Warning, Queensryche EP and Rage for order that they were not ALLOWED to play anymore because Tate could not sing the songs anymore was awesome. Do I wish the original band would have stayed together? YES!!! But there is no I in BAND.  I think Mr. Tate needs to come to grips with that.  This is a band again and the guys are happy.  I guess that is the most important part for me.  See you guys on tour and can't wait for the next album.

B003IWRE3I|5.0|One of my favorite movies ever. Extremely sad and depressing, but the acting is wonderful. I've watched it 10 times already. Great story!
B009RH9HDS|5.0|Love the versatility of this particular cover, also the fact that I can lay in bed and just lay it on myself and be able to read  without having to hold it in my hands.  I like it best over my old one which to read I had to constantly hold in my hands.
B00BESFWBY|4.0|This movie is a nice movie that the whole family can watch.  Amazing photography of some very large waves and someone actually had to ride them to get the shots they did.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I highly recommend for defeating  boredom!!  Can't wait for the follow ons!  Enjoyed the challenge!!! Very entertaining. Loved it!! Didn't take long to crack the code!
B004OZZ624|4.0|The story line is believable and the movie moves along with plenty of action.  Ending was interesting - could someone really do that?
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good game want more levels. Easier than other games like this that u can't get past the third level on.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This is such a nice series with interesting story lines and setting.  You quickly get pulled into the story line.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|LOVE IT! It's an exciting, & fast pace game. Recomend that you try it. You will love it too.<br /> ess.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I love this show, and the special features are great.  I got this on a big sale, and the price was fantastic
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|This was a good movie, lots of action, very believable, but it did drag a bit at points. Overall, good entertainment.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|Great app to watch all the music videos for free in HD .The lastest videos are made available almost instantly.
B00847KFDS|5.0|I'm a Fogerty fan anyway, but the artists that sang with him are awesome.  Each song is great.  I highly recommend.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Samsung Galaxy S3<br /><br />I normally don't play these types of games. Because of the positive reviews, I gave it a chance.<br /><br />The floors are not too challenging to frustrate me and uninstall. They're not too easy either, which keeps my interest peaked. Perfect level of difficulty. There were times I was stuck, but I kept poking around and eventually found what it was I needed.<br /><br />There were times it seemed that I had to be a little more precise in some areas to touch. I know I had poked around multiple times, but it took just the right sweet spot to open something or view a specific area of the room. If you must enter a code or use an item to open something, sometimes it doesn't automatically open, so you have to poke around to do so.<br /><br />What I liked best about this app versus the publisher's other two similar apps, is that they kept the ads under the gameplay window instead of in it. I uninstalled the other two because of this.<br /><br />All in all, a very good game that should be fun for just about any age that can comprehend the challenges. Maybe as young as 7 or 8 years old. A 12 year old should definitely be able to do it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not so easy but not so hard. awesome! really enjoyed this game!! this is an escape game id really recommend.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|i really enjoyed this game because it was intriguing and complex but not too challenging that you cant figure it out on your own.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Fun to play, great graphics, easy follow and game play logistics. Awesome game.  You will really enjoy this story behind this game.
B00CM9JKQM|3.0|Alright. Listened to it twice through the headphones, as this is the best way for any Queensryche. They come very close to the early Queensryche, but I feel somewhat that the mark was missed as well. Great intro to set the mood. I guess I expected it to be a lot better, because the rest of the band would have been essentially sitting on a load of material that they have not been able to use, due to Tate shooting it down in the past for previous releases. Favorite tracks in my order.<br /><br />In this Light<br />Where Dreams Go To Die<br />Fallout<br />A World Without<br /><br />On the other side of the coin. I feel that Tate's newest Queensryche effort was a good Tate release, but not a Queensryche release. This Queensryche stays more true to how it should be. Tates effort was criticized a lot, on the mix. Well, I feel the guitars are buried in the mix on this effort. Scott's drums are equally front and center to Todd's vocals. This really shows Scott is a great drummer. I would guess Todd is out front to show that he can pull off what Tate no longer can, but does nothing that has not already been done. I feel that on the more aggressive tunes, will appeal to the newer generation. Not too memorable for me. Still no Lady Wore Black. All in all I could just live with the tunes listed above and maybe Open Road as well. Rage For Order is still my favorite beginning to end. Not even close to earn a 5 star review. There are times when I review a release solely on a couple songs that were over the top, but that does not even happen either. All in all, it is a solid release.<br /><br />After further listening to this, I had to drop it down a notch. If I could give it 3 1/2 stars I would. I cant believe how short this effort is. With the time they had and all the material they had in the vault, that Tate never let them use, this is all they could come up with. The intro thing of x2 is cool, it sets the classic setting. Midnight Lullaby is just filler to an already short release. Also, the mix is hindered. I don't know what these studio's are trying to pull off these days. Don't get me wrong, I like the songs I have stated on here, I am just bummed that this is all there is.<br />I see on TMS that Todd makes a statement on there that these songs will stand the test of time such as the classics. Well, I highly doubt that. What it boils down to for me, between the two efforts is, I like about the same amount of songs on each one, with this effort staying true to what Queensryche was. Tate needs to shake the name and move on his own.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a fun little game to play if you're a big fan of horses. It's worth trying out at least once
B001CDWFPC|5.0|Superb translation and great footnotes and other background information.  I recommend this study Bible very highly.  It is the best available today.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This product is challenging and totally worth the buy. I would reccomend this game for anyone who likes the game temple run or minion rush. I am very impressed. Five stars
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Though I've never been a huge fan of the horror movies this show is spun off of, this crime-scene-investigation style show with a twist is the perfect combination of superb acting, intricately webbed story-that you can still keep track of (if you can remember names)-and just enough gore. Five stars!
B004L3AR0K|2.0|I bought this video because I like both Actors, Jake G. and Anne.  I was looking for a Romantic story and what I got was a story about drugs and those who need to take them.  I am very sorry to say I did not like this DVD at all.  Jake glorying in his sales of the companies latest drug was a complete turnoff.  It was just glorifying Greed.<br /><br />Sure the drug is good for those who truly need it ... but building your wealth on sexual addiction is not a Romantic story I was looking for.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|There is in an internal error that prevents us from playing the game at all. A fix would be nice and hopefully then, a change in rating! Very disappointed.
0375869026|5.0|There are already so many raving reviews about this book on Amazon, and I am here to add to that!<br /><br />August is the main character, and having been born with a mutant gene, he looks different. August, 'Auggie', has always been homeschooled, but his parents decide (at 5th grade), to send him to public school, at a sort of academy. Think if International School, with having to go to a &#34;lottery&#34;, and then taking a test to get in.<br /><br />The story follows August as he encounters the choppy waves of middle school, and he learns true friendship, along with other values such as honesty and integrity, along with never being afraid of your feelings.<br /><br />Very minimal problems I have with the book are simply just my way of thinking. One includes of how young he is, ten. A more mature protagonist would have been preferred, but there is a sort of child innocence that does play very well with the book. August is sensitive and if he were older, that sort of naiveness might not have been part of the equation.<br /><br />During Justin's part in the book, it was very unorganized, with no capitals, quotations, or punctuation. Of course, this does accentuate his personality, so the reader does have to overlook that.<br /><br />All in all, this is a very touching book about a boy who has looks different, but still has a very positive outlook on life. His sister, Olivia, is an AMAZNG role model, and in her part of the book, she does explain how hard it can be to have a brother like Auggie. She is not perfect, nor is anyone in the book, but that is what makes it an amazing read.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I was very surprised at how entertaining this book was! The old pictures blur the line between reality and the peculiar world. Can't wait for Hollow City!
B0092S4WLY|4.0|This is fun, especially for fans of HOG. It is way too short, though, and I hope more will be coming soon.
034580404X|5.0|I couldn't put the book down! I would definitely recommend these books to others. This is a must read series.
B008OOYALE|4.0|the game is very cute, and the graphics are well done. The gameplay is simple enough that you can play it every so often without feeling like you are missing something.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the newest update but what's up with going to the nether? WORTH $7.00 if not get free version
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is one of the best puzzle games I have ever come across....if anything it's too short...hope their are some updates soon!!  I'll be anxiously waiting!
0812983459|5.0|Finished the book a few hours ago and I still have a lump in my throat.  As I face challenges in my future I hope I'll remember, just like Harold, to just put one foot in front of the other.<br /><br />Read this book!  Don't give up at the beginning, because it does start off a little slow.  By the end, the payoff is huge.  These are characters you will remember long after you've finished the book.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|If I could, I'd give it 4 1/2 stars... Lots of action, fun characters (Willis and Parker were great together), and anything with Carl Urban is always good.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Dear friend, Today I read this book. Then I watched the movie. The movie was better! So rare this is. Let's keep this a secret.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini has a true knack in creating characters that you feel like you know.  Through his characters, he brings you closer to a culture I can only read about and yet these same characters could be set in any land.  They show us the strength, and weakness, of the human spirit as well as the love, family bonds, and mistakes we make in the name of the same.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Game of Thrones is a good primer for the business world. Especially finance. Where all that's valued is money and power.
B00CXL6XP0|5.0|It is about time the Queensryche sound of old is back. The only thing missing is Chris D coming back. Fantastic sound, Great songs, nice to see the BAND writing all the songs. Can't wait to see them live again.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was a very fun and challenging app that compelled me to keep playing until I had finished all levels.  Looking forward to new levels!
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|Its a great game and I could play forever but one thing is sad about this game. Up until a  certain point it will not let you connect. Even if you sign in. But other than that fun for a free FPS
1401201911|5.0|My second favorite  Millar story, Old Man Logan.<br />Fresh look on well-known hero. Wonder to see &#34;red&#34; version of other Marvel heroes ;)<br />Definitly, worth to read.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is a he'll of an awesome game!! I'm hooked! Great job!! Great download it so worth it.It the free app out there with the HD graphic and blasting sound and effects.
B00C5UV3YU|3.0|It is amusing to hear these ladies sing lyrics about their values and Christian faith yet their entire repertoire is based on music videos selling their bodies as sex objects (even singing about such.) It is less of an indictment of these three ladies than it is about the genre in which they perform. The entire pop music market is about sex. Who can show the most skin, without being censored wins the jackpot. No matter that the pressures placed on these individuals to stay \\"bikini skinny\\" and to perfect the dance moves while hardly eating and resting, the only thing that matters is that they are deemed sexy by the so-called fans and the industry moguls. What a shame.<br /><br />I hope, one of these days, Kelly Rowland will actually learn that music is a true artform and that being a stripper (like Beyonce' Knowles) is not... and thus will mature into contemporary adult music, instead of this teen lust, street thug, burlesque-like stuff that she now performs (along with her band mates).<br /><br />But, that aside, these ladies are beautiful and they do dance incredibly suggestively enough to warrant admiration (even if for the wrong reasons.) Most of the music is laughable, but that is to be expected from the genre. Only when they perform ballads do these ladies shine as truly beautiful women - not just as eye candy but as real vocalists.<br /><br />The video is worth 3 stars for the naughtiness. Toni Braxton's video collection is superior.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Didn't do much investigation before renting it, just saw the rating and was in the mood for something like this. I was delighted that it was fun and well done like How to Train Your Dragon. It has the quirkiness and quality storyline.
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|I have been a fan of Queensryche since I was 14 (I'm 31 now), and although the post-DeGarmo material settled into mediocrity, I always held some small hope that the band would surprise me with a strong third act. Dedicated to Chaos made me completely give up on them, and when I had learned last year that Geoff Tate had gotten kicked out of Queensryche, I sort of expected them to wither away and die. He was the frontman, blessed with the golden pipes, and could sail on talent and his cache as a songwriter during the band's best years. But with age and lack of care, he lost the ability to deliver the soaring vocals of his youth - and his songwriting lacked strong melodies or lyrics. It is now clear that Queensryche could never again fully realize a sound with Tate at the helm.<br /><br />Apparently all it took was a new, talented and hungry vocalist for these guys to rock again. Enter Todd La Torre, whose performance on \\"Queensryche (2013)\\" is absolutely tremendous. He sounds very much like Geoff Tate on most of the songs, and has an aggressive delivery that fits the new music exceptionally well. And the music? It sounds like a cross between classic Queensryche and Nu-Metal, mostly lacking in progressive elements (to my slight disappointment). However, that doesn't mean I don't think it's good - it's quite good - with La Torre (vox) and Rockenfield (drums) in particular excelling throughout. I haven't gone fully through the lyrics yet, but they appear to generally be a strength. The guitar solos are a mixed bag, with several of them seeming like a random collection of notes rather than highlighting the music with a stylistic flourish. Most of this is simply nitpicking, however, as there's not a bad song on the disc. However, at 35 minutes, it is a bit light in length. Some of that may be due to pressure by both their new label and the pending lawsuit with Tate to get something out there.<br /><br />This album is going to do well, and I am pleased to say that Queensryche is not only alive and well, but my expectations for their next album are through the roof. Regardless of how the lawsuit turns out, these guys have already won the war.
B008LUM25M|5.0|An amazing maze of a book wher you just don't know whats happening on the begening, and you follow up the characters feelings just so well you can't belive it is not you the one running
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was very fun and it gives you a challenge sometimes. I would suggest getting it because it is free and its awesome.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Instead of 5 monkeys there's a better and bigger version of a monkey though it is not awesome that the monkey is trying to kill the runners.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|My students talked me into watching this... I'm still shocked how much I enjoy &#34;Awkward.&#34; Smartly written with some quick humor and funny portrayals of student &#34;types,&#34; this was a sleeper hit!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game it si a great chall<br /><br />I LOVE THIS GAME IT IS A CHALLENGE FOR EVERYONE WHO PLAYS IT.
B000AP04NI|5.0|I love this movie. After seeing the musical performed recently, I just had to buy the movie. It was delivered in a timely manner and was unopened as promised. I'm so glad I can watch this movie any time I want now! Oh, what a beautiful day!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I keep finding the urge to play more and more and build my skill I think good for older adults keeps you sharp. I really enjoy it
159463176X|5.0|This book will make you sit and not get up once you start it...I adore the book and the subject matter and writer...WONDERFUL!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I really liked this game. It is exiting and really cool. I can not stop playing it my cousin and I can join games make world's together and a whole bunch of other things. If you get this game you will be happy that you got it. Because I am!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game soo realistic and fun.great game for horselovers :) I recomend this game. its really fun.if you love horsesand needxa new game. This is it!
0452295548|5.0|First learned of Dr. Taylor by watching her TED talk.  She has had an amazing experience--a stroke--analyzed by a brain scientist, herself.  She relates the experience of her left brain hemisphere shutting down, thereby allowing her to experience a clarity that could be enlightenment.  It is a captivating read and is really thought-provoking.  Highly recommend this book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very entertaining. !!  I love the hunt it keeps you busy and thinking. You must hurry and create more rooms asap!
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|The whole movie was great, especially Daniel Day-Lewis!  I'm a huge fan of his work and here he is playing perhaps the greatest U.S. President ever.
B00BHU2A7I|1.0|when is Hollywood going to GROW UP and make intelligent movies  the only little decent factor in Hitchcock was Helen Mirren's  performance  She did the best she could with a terrible part
B008AX1HD8|4.0|I have really enjoyed the Harry Hole series of novels not that I have finished hem all and not in the ideal sequence. I have just enjoyed the reality of the characters and this situations nesbo places them in. I can feel for Harry who is full of faults and yet has some ideals he holds dear. These tales are classic thriller tales and all I can add is that I have really enjoyed them and commend them to a reader. Good plots and well researched background. This one gave me a better understanding of the place aborigine have in Australia without all the political flotsam.
B002M3SP28|3.0|Maybe it's because I finished the trilogy of Child 44 just before I started this book, but Mallory seems so 1 dimensional after Leo Demidova.
B008220C38|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie. This movie surprised me, and after rereading this book in my 30 ties this movie was like a nice overview of the book I just finished. Some people like and accept modern art some don't, for me this movie was like piece of modern work, extraordinary point of view, definitely very talented and well done work. Absolutely worth money and time<br />I am happy to see such an unique way of perception of such a talented artist as Joe Wright is.
0446572764|5.0|This is the 1st book in a trilogy of books, Secret Speech & Agent 6 are the other two. This is a top rate thriller and I usually don't even bother going to see thrillers. Since Tom Hardy is playing the lead however I decided  to read it anyway. I used the memory of Tom's face to start the book but before I knew it Leo developed his own look and that was the face that remained for the last two books too.
B002QW7AJY|4.0|This is the best \\"Aliens\\" knock-off I've ever seen.  Although it has second-rate actors, they are pretty decent second-rate actors.  In fact, I must give Ben Foster some credit for playing a role so totally different than his character in \\"Six Feet Under\\".  It's been a long time since we've seen Dennis Quaid in something good, too.  The plot has it's own twists and isn't nearly as derivative as the cinemetography is.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|on this hair style game you get to make a hair style for 2 kids the other 2 you have to buy for 3.99 I don't like that!!!!!!!  but you could still use the other girls. and there's one boy to get the full game. you have to pay 9.99 that's almost 10.00 that is a ripoff like I was saying you can hair style the kids like this blowing their hair and if your good at braiding you could give them braids I'm tellin' you this is the best game in the world and. you can also cut their hair what ever you want get this great game today. by Anna's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Just enough drama and suspense.  Landay has captured the emotion of a family in distress and the love that binds them.
B0001HLVSC|5.0|This is one of my favorite all time movies, action, historical content and correctness. Russell Crowe does an amazing job in this film!
0060899190|3.0|I like reading the Postsecret stuff and I'm happy with this book. Just a lot of the secrets are (naturally) sad, so it's not a real happy thing most of the time. If you like the website, you'll like this book.
B00D3V85FA|4.0|I have heard lots about this band and the influence they have had on music. So I decided \\"hey let me try Black Sabbath's new album\\" I always avoided them because of Ozzy's vocal style...he sucks but on this record his suckiness fits the music while I might add is the reason I like this album. These instruments are so good that they make me ignore Ozzy and pay attention to Tony Iommi's sludgy and very entertaining gutiar work. The songs can kind of remind you of Alice In Chains in a way. May I add that Alice In Chains has some of the best gutiar work these days. There aren't many albums that have this guitar style and I'm happy I tried. I think this is the last Sabbath album..if it is..then they finished strong
B00BHMETKC|3.0|I had high expectations, but it wasn't nearly as suspensefully as I expected.  I didn't feel like we really got to know any of the characters.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Just glad you were here when Google decided to split.. I have used this before Google disappeared and enjoy the layout. Works well on my Kindle Fire HD.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|If it wasn't so senselessly gorey, I would give it five stars, but it is Tarentino.  Enough said.  Leo helps, too.
B00CDCIQX6|4.0|A very different kind of film but with an intriguing story line of 3 stories wrapped into one -- it starts a little slow but builds momentum
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book and can't wait for the next book.  Jeffrey Archer is becoming one of my favorite authors!!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is one of my favorite game apps! I love that the challenge is to beat yourself. It's a great way to pass the time.
0756405890|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing. If you want something to read and you are just not sure if this is the book for you, take my advice and just buy this book. You will thank me later. Go ahead and buy book 2, The wise mans fear, at the same time. It will save you time later, as you will be have a compulsive need to devour it as soon as you finish book one. Again you will thank me later.
B005K17RU0|2.0|Using a kindle fire the AccuWeather app is always showing up as an ongoing update but it goes hours and HOURS without updating! By 11 am the weather has changed dramatically from 7 am and I don't want to be seeing that little &quot;1&quot; up in my upper left corner like it's a current update. False advertising! Also, there are no past year averages or highs or lows. Very disappointed. Changing back to The Weather Channel after 2 weeks trial with AccuWeather.
0756407915|5.0|One of my favorite books. All I can say is buy this. Read this. Patrick Rothfuss is a master at story telling. Enjoy this people. Enjoy!
B00C061HZY|5.0|Been waiting for this one, for a long time. It's a great album, stunning artwork on the sleeve and a good quality, thick piece of vinyl. I also love that you get the mp3 album with it for free. This is how music should be made and sold!
B00AREIAI8|2.0|This app is fun for a while, but you don't make fast progress, it takes me a week just to get to the next level. I  isn't that I don't like it, but it gets boring after a while.<br />:)
B00BESM14U|5.0|While the two films are not very similar, The Perks of Being a Wallflower seemed almost like an updated version of The Breakfast Club for me.  The three main actors, Logan Lerman, Ezra Miller and Emma Watson, were amazing.  It's great to see Miss Watson getting work outside of Harry Potter and not being typecast.
B001KZG99A|4.0|Plenty of action and fun to watch. The special effects were assume. I would recommend this to anyone who has seen The Avengers and wanted more.
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|I was really looking forward to this flick as a follow up to Knocked Up, but was slightly disappointed in the jokes and pacing.  Part of this could have been due to me watching the unrated version.  The film seemed like it could have lasted for 90-105 minutes instead of the 138.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This app is wonderful. I use it every day. I downloaded it on two generations of kindled. Works reliably and is easy to use.
B00BESLHEA|2.0|While the previews seemed great, all the best parts seemed to be given away early on.  I felt myself becoming bored throughout the film.
B00CSWA1PM|5.0|The music sets the tone and gives the cast something to sing about. WONDERFUL! Tony Award winning Cyndi Lauper, ladies and gentlemen. Anthemic &#34;Raise You Up&#34; will make you want to get up and rejoice who you are and love yourself a lot more. Even if you never get to see the songs performed live on stage you'll enjoy this fascinating grouping of music.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Brought back a lot of memories, there were a few details that I had forgotten about this episode.  I also appreciated the director's commentary.
B003OCWF6I|5.0|I thought this movie was a blast, a lot of fun with action and cool characters.  Wish they would make a sequel.
0879309210|4.0|Pretty good book for general knowledge.  I hope there will be another edition in the future that would go more into depth about  pickups and wiring
B0064W667Y|4.0|Excellent dialogue but not the most original tale ever told. Although I really love the premise. Overall good story and I plan to continue.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Orson Scott Card does a great job of making you sympathize with Ender's character. I became very invested and couldn't put it down.
B009GFEOY8|5.0|There is no other film, this is it.  It is different from old Polaroid film and you need to use at least one pack go learn how it reacts and prints but the results were well worth it and that works for me.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It is a harder game then it looks at first, good for long bus rides.<br />Colorful and simple the interface is intuitive and I have not encountered a single bug.
B001G70M6S|5.0|I have three different models of pack film cameras.  This is is the answer, instant results, brilliant prints, dare I say better than the original polaroid film.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Beautifully written. The characters will haunt you once you put the book down. I couldn't wait to pick it back up!
B008YRVW0I|3.0|Game was fu  til I realized it won't allow me to shop for comfort items.  i can buy fishies and tank window dressing but not comfort items (such as food &amp; vitamins) for the fishies.<br /><br />So I'd give the Kindle Tablet Edition a 2.5.
B008JFUPFI|4.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />The more I think about my experience with Man of Steel the more I realize how indifferent I feel towards the film. Nothing about it was inherently bad, but I kind of left the theater feeling like I didn't really get anything out of the movie. It should be noted that I've never been Superman's number one fan. Personally, I always enjoyed the cartoon that aired when I was a child over any of the films, but I expected this to be different. I think part of my indifference stems from me expecting one thing based on the trailers, but ending up receiving something slightly different. Now this has been a somewhat common occurrence as of late (Iron Man 3 & Now You See Me come to mind), but it never ceases to be annoying.<br /><br />By now it's common knowledge that the last attempt to reboot the Superman franchise was a total disaster. I have yet to meet someone who has anything nice to say about Superman Returns, but I think audiences will be singing a different tune about Man of Steel. While Returns was boring, predictable, and, to be honest, a little stupid, Man of Steel is strong, heartfelt, and confident in what it sets out to do. With that said, there was just something about its execution that didn't sit right with me.<br /><br />Man of Steel begins with the origin story; providing some slight deviations from the source material, but that's not what threw me off. While we were going through the events on Krypton I couldn't help but feel like I was watching a Star Wars movie. The environments, the color scheme, the weird lizard/dragon thing that Jor-El (Russell Crowe) kept riding around; it all looked like something ripped out of the prequel films. Not only that, but these environments aren't completely believable. Obvious CGI is obvious and I found it hard to focus on what was going on because everything just looked so fake. The worst part of it is that they spent at least a good 15-20 minutes (estimation, didn't time it) wasting time going over something that everyone knows about. I don't mind retelling an origin story, but make it snappy.<br /><br />Once we get off Krypton and find ourselves on Earth things start to smooth out a bit. From there we follow a confused Clark Kent aka Kal-El (Henry Cavill) as he tries to figure out who he is and where he came from. As the story progresses we get glimpses of Clark's upbringing through flashbacks. Usually these flashbacks occur after he passes out from doing some great feat like saving a ship crew. He soon meets Lois Lane (Amy Adams) and saves her life as she's doing a news report up in the mountains. We're given more details into his past as he explains his story to her and why he tries to keep himself hidden.<br /><br />To be honest, the connection being made between Clark and Lois is one of the best things about Man of Steel. It's very honest and pure and both parties know that neither of them are capable of understanding what the other is going through because they're two completely different people. Yet they know that there's some weird connection between the two of them and they're not sure what the appropriate action should be. All of this is excelled even further because Cavill and Adams have a beautiful chemistry onscreen that makes the whole thing just feel right.<br /><br />While I loved the introduction to these characters, I wasn't too fond of the predictability of the story. The antagonist in the film is General Zod (Michael Shannon), an ex-rebel on Krypton who gets sent to the Phantom Zone after killing Jor-El. Our time on Krypton comes to a close shortly after these events, but what got to me is the fact that Krypton exploded right after Zod was exiled. Not only that, but Lara Lor-Van (Ayeket Zurer) acted as if this were expected. If that's the case why send Zod to the Phantom Zone in the first place? Just let him blow up with everyone else. I knew that after they sent him off the planet he was going to eventually find his way to Earth. I knew this as someone who's only read a handful of the comics. Unfortunately, in movies like this, being able to predict the story 20 minutes in winds up taking some of the fun out of the experience.<br /><br />The other thing I really loved, aside from the perfectly cast Clark and Lois, was the fight sequences. This is how you make fight scenes in a comic book movie, or at least a Superman movie. Because these individuals aren't human their punches need to look powerful. Not only that, but the audience needs to be able to feel the force of the blows just by watching them on screen. Well Zack Snyder nailed it. Not all movie goers will understand the reference, but I found that the fight sequences reminded me of the fighting mechanics in the recently released Injustice: Gods Among Us (a fighting game featuring an extensive cast of DC characters.) The action is fast, it's powerful, and you can see just how hard they're hitting each other based on the destruction around the city. It was everything it needed to be and then some.<br /><br />Overall I felt the casting was very well done. I already mentioned my love for Cavill and Adams, but they're not the only ones who delivered with their performances. Kevin Costner and Diana Lane appear as Jonathan and Martha Kent, respectively. Both of them were perfectly cast for their roles and Diana Lane absolutely nailed her performance. Oh, that reminds me, the way Cavill was able to bring out the love that Clark has for Martha was outstanding. There's a scene where Zod goes to his house and Clark goes on a mini-rampage. Everything from his dialogue to his actions was beyond perfect. Michael Shannon gave another solid performance as Zod and Laurence Fishburn, a perfect choice by the way, was spot on as Perry White.<br /><br />Finally, the score, composed by Hans Zimmer, was a little underwhelming. I've grown very fond of Zimmer over the years, but most of the compositions just didn't seem to fit with their corresponding scenes. It seemed as if every single piece was this grand, larger-than-life composition and not every scene calls for that sort of thing. The occasional somber composition usually worked out, but there wasn't enough of it. Definitely not his strongest score, but I've heard worse.<br /><br />Overall Score: 7.75/10 - Man of Steel isn't one of those films that's perfect from start to finish. It's kind of a bumpy ride, but it more than makes up for it with the wonderful casting and the gripping action sequences. There's definitely room for improvement, and there's obviously going to be a sequel, so I look forward to seeing where they take this rebooted series in the future.
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|At last, an actual Queensrÿche album!! Todd La Torre has earned his place as the rightful heir to the throne once held by the now reviled Geoff Tate. There may be mixing problems here and there, the production is a little compressed and rushed sounding (not as bad as FU though), and the length of the album is extremely short, but overall, this is a very solid slab of music and a phenomenal return to form after many years of mediocre and deplorable albums. This points the way to a renaissance of sorts for this gem of a band.
0143122843|5.0|These stories about life in Europe during and after WWII are brilliant. If a reader hasn't read the Bernie Gunther novels he/she will be entranced.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|While not the largest of apps in term of playtime, it's certainly worthy of a play if you enjoy a good puzzle game.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I feel that the author has lost interest in the real story in book 5 and is just interested in adding new people just to keep the books going. keeps killing off the people that you become familiar with just to add new people.  I did like the other 4 books.
B00AEFYQE2|3.0|it is o.k. but I am not sure why or what the content in this movie was all about except free sex for the two of them without commitment
B004GYY714|5.0|I can listen to whatever type of music I am in the mood to hear. I can listen anywhere, or use my headphones and listen to my personal music, anywhere.
072325804X|5.0|I bought this for my cousin.  As a young girl she wanted a to buy a Beatrix Potter book from the book club at school.  Her parents act like that was the end of the world.  It hurt her deeply and I wanted to do something nice for her.  this is the complete set of al the books.  she loves this and is kept where she can see it everyday.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Great app, allows me to search the web for whatever I need to find. Easy to use on my Kindle Fire. I highly recommend this.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|A very thought provoking and interesting read. The book takes the reader very much outside a comfort level of thought and reality.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love this app!!! But realms is $15-$30 dollars A MONTH!!!! I do like this game don't get me wrong but realms should be cheaper.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Love it. Love it. I have downloaded all the games from this company.  Love them all but this is by far my favorite. More please. It's very hard waiting for new games. I play on a kindle and truly addicted.<br />Christine
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Flow Free is a fun game to pass the time. This app allows you to use your brain to complete the many flow puzzles in the app. I gave this app four stars because it gets repetitive most of the time you play it. You almost play the exact same puzzles, some a bit more challanging than others. I recommend getting this app. ~KindleAppReviews
B00CUWWLWG|1.0|Downloaded and installed game, but it won't open.Keeps crashing. Uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times, but still won't load! Wifi is on, so there's no reason it shouldn't. IF I ever get to play, I'll write another review. Glad it was free!
0345522478|4.0|If you like fantasy books with lots of witches, warlocks, deitys, and all the other supernaturals out there, this book has most of em, and then a few extras to boot. ;)<br /><br />Our main character is a druid that kicks butt, and doesn't care about your name as long as your not a witch out to get a body sample. He's an old, well practiced, sword wielding, supernaturals slaying druid. I mentioned old, but even so, he still acts like he's in his 20's, and in some ways he is. You'll find he has a good way to pass time, and thats with his buddy oberon, who happens to be an irish wolf hound.<br /><br />Our druid has a few quirks, but he's pretty witty when he needs to be, and his lawyers make the normal cold, bloodsucking, money loving lawyers, look like teddy bears. Of course you'd think being so witty this druid would know how to stay outta trouble, but thats just not so. When you've got a mad Tua g0d after you, things just don't like to stay quiet, which you'll find out when you read this.

030758836X|2.0|Starting out i thought Gillian Flynn may have written a good story. But as the story goes on and on and it gets a bit doldrum and long but I think it is the way it is narrated as a book on tape. The Narrators are NOT GOOD at narrating. It takes a talent and good voices to successfully narrate. This book does not have what it takes as a book on tape. The end is terrible.  I don't think the author knew how to end it. Very Disappointing. I can never quit reading a book once I start but I almost returned this one. .
0062255657|5.0|I was fortunate enough to see the author debut this book at the Brooklyn Academy of music, and waited five hours on a long line to have him sign my copy.  I read the book in less time than that, but both actions were worth the wait.  This is a rich yet fast-paced story that is wholly adult, wholly English, and wholly engrossing.  Neil uses detail like gilding, not a support mechanism; you never tire of his descriptions when they appear, and as the story winds up, you realize that each detail has a greater purpose in the story.<br /><br />This is one of his tightest works to date.  Go read it.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great Movie, watched it several times.  You will like it if you like Twilight, The Host, City of Bones, etc.  My husband even liked it

B00AZMFO6I|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />Neatly tucked away in the bucolic English countryside, Beecham House is a retirement home for aged singers and musicians who still perform for one another - and for the occasional outsider - on a regular basis. It is with the arrival of a newcomer - starchily played by the always-starchy Maggie Smith - that the tranquility of the place is suddenly threatened. For, you see, Jean Horton, a former opera diva, world-renowned for both her talent and her temper, was once briefly and unhappily married to one of the residents there, Reggie (Tom Courtenay), who had hoped to live out what is left of his life in peace, never having to see or interact with Jean ever again. Jean and Reggie once comprised one-half of a singing quartet that also included two other residents, Wilf (Billy Connelly) and Cissy (Pauline Collins), and the hope is that the four can be convinced to reunite for a performance that will bring in some much needed revenue for the home which otherwise might have to close its doors due to insufficient funds.<br /><br />Adapted by Ronald Harwood from his 1999 play, \\"Quartet\\" is a sweet and poignant comedy/drama that acknowledges the sadness and difficulties of growing old without unnecessarily dwelling on them. Long past their primes, these talented, life-affirming individuals know full well what the years have robbed them of, but they are also, to varying degrees, making the best of the time that is still left to them, though of the four, Jean is clearly having the greatest trouble adjusting to the realities of aging. The movie shows that it often takes as much courage for an artist to exercise his talents at the end of his life as it does at the beginning.<br /><br />In helming the project, Dustin Hoffman joins his colleagues Paul Newman (\\"Rachel, Rachel\\"), Robert Redford (\\"Ordinary People\\"), Warren Beatty (\\"Heaven Can Wait\\"), and Denzel Washington (\\"Antwone Fisher\\") in proving, in his first time in the director`s chair, that he is as adept behind the camera as he is in front of it. \\"Quartet\\" is clearly an actors' picture, and Hoffman, respecting both the material and the talents he has on hand, wisely pulls back and lets these great seasoned performers do what it is they do best. The plotting may be a bit pat and predictable at times, but you can't go wrong with an acting quartet like the one here.hind the camera as he is in front of it. \\"Quartet\\" is clearly an actors' picture, and Hoffman, respecting both the material and the talents he has on hand, wisely pulls back and lets these great seasoned performers do what it is they do best.

B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I watched this movie with my ten year old niece.  She truly enjoyed watching the &#34;good&#34; monkey.  She been monkey crazy since she left the hospital.  We both sat there trying to figure out who the good witch was.  A lot of review finds it a waste of time.  I say it was enjoyable.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|Great game, but with the upgrade, it says it loads 57.26 MB EVERY time it is opened.  And it only works now while on-line.  If off-line (like when the kids are in the car), it will not open.  If this isn't fixed it will become history as the kids cannot play it \\"anywhere.\\"
