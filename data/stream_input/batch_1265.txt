B004LUS390|5.0|I'm a big fan of this app. Its perfect for a quick sketch on my kindle fire. I only had a problem with saving. I lost a good sketch because I had to leave my device idle for a time. So that was kind of annoying. Seems like you have to back out of the app to get the option to save, when a simple button would suffice. Either way, its a good tool when in need of a mobile digital painting.
B0060V1WJ6|1.0|Ryan Gosling has sucked before, Steve Carrell has sucked,in some previous appearances. This movie accomplishes a trifecta otherwise, though, It is the worst movie appearance ever of Julianne Moore, the worst movie appearance ever for Marisa Tomei,and a pretty mediocre outing for Kevin Bacon.

B003Y74AXO|4.0|Okay, what is there to say about this product other than it is what it says it is. Screen protector, cleaning cloth and you're good to go. If you need it, get it. If you don't, then don't. That's all.
B003PTP4S6|3.0|I love Enio Morriconi's music.  I really like Yo-Yo Ma's playing.  Unfortunately, I did not really like the combination.  I much prefer the original orchestration of Morriconi's scores.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a fantastic game that is entertaining yet soothing. The zen music, the elegant graphics... it's lovely to have this game as an alternative to some of the garishly loud, childlike games (those are fun, too). I am glad that I got it -- on my kindle fire, which I also love. Great to play between assignments to center yourself.
B000HBKCDC|4.0|Although some of the tracks are traditional Christmas songs, every song sounds unique to the artist because she successfully synchronizes her elegant styling with the original music and lyrics. For the most part, the album is quiet in tone but robust with Sarah Mclachlan's velvety voice. I'm glad that this isn't another generic holiday album. It makes me wish I had a tiny cabin with a wood fireplace in which to watch the snow fall and listen to this music.

B005DD7H50|3.0|There are a lot of movies about drug addiction, and most try to be emotional heart-brakers.  This one tries to be the opposite.  Built around the experience of a failed author who comes across a drug that improves mental performance, this movie comes across as an action flick that is part crime thriller, part drama and part adventure.  Bradley Cooper was a perfect fit for the role; I could not have seen anyone else act his part.  However, some of the scenes seem forced.  For example, his borrowing of a large amount of money from some unscrupulous folks was totally against character.  Also, for someone so smart, he does the absolutely stupid thing of storing all of his drugs in one place.  Overall, a better-than average movie.  The premise is good, along with the acting; however the script could have done with better editing to clean up some logical errors.
B003Y74KCK|5.0|Love this case for my new iPhone 4s. The sides sometime interfere with input, but just pull the cover away from the side a little bit and the problem is resolved. Comfortable to hold and gives great protection from accidental bumps. White cover on white phone is great!

Perfect formula for cool relaxed scifi read.<br /><br />TD

020161622X|2.0|I've seen this book suggested enough times on amazon and stackexchange, so finally figured it's worth a read. For whatever reason, this is the kind of book which often gets touted, and not the comparatively underrated CS textbooks. Maybe \\"professional programmers\\" are beyond textbooks.  There is certainly knowledge to be found here, however sparse it may be. I would say there is more insight within the first chapter of Principles of Computer Systems Design than this book contains from cover to cover. The book can still be an entertaining read about programming, in much the same way browsing stackexchange is.   To their credit, the section on making quality a product requirement was worth a read. Still, most of the book is filled with enlightenment such as this excerpt from \\"How to Program Deliberately\\":  -Always be aware of what you are doing.  -Don't code blindfolded  -Proceed from a plan...   -Rely only on reliable things.  -Prioritize your effort.  $35 for this, are you serious?  The book requires an anecdote to explain the simplest concepts, of which there are many. This seems to be a lengthy exercise in writing about programming in analogies, metaphors, and aphorisms.
B003L77GG0|1.0|What a disappointment! Writers block supreme! they resurrected every villain, acquaintance, and relative of Clarks. They made him face and defeat every one he ever fought and then killed them off again. So many flashbacks the viewer often lost sight of what was actually going on.  More alternate dimensions, got sent back to the phantom zone, the Luthers, on again off again weddings, and any other trite cliche you can think of. Barely watchable and certainly not worth the price.
B000001GYC|5.0|These wonderfully musical performances of Mendelssohn's \\"Songs without Words\\" by Daniel Barenboim display a pianism of highest order, the noble restraint of which reminds me of the artistry of Artur Rubinstein. Barenboim makes the instrument sing most beautifully and plays some of the most taxing scores with stunning dexterity and fluency. The 70s' stereo recording has very realistic and full sound quality.
1451629184|4.0|This book was a quick read, because I was very interested in hearing about the story and how a girl could be abducted and held in captivity for 18 years without anyone knowing.<br /><br />What I read in here absolutely shocked me.  It felt like I was reading a diary of Jaycee's life over a span of 18 years.  It felt as if she was just writing everything and getting it all out, sort of like a form of therapy.<br /><br />The details of what Philip Garrido did to Jaycee and how his wife Nancy was complicit in all of it absolutely sickened me.  I cannot imagine having to write a book with all of these details in it, but it just speaks to how much Jaycee put up with and how strong she is to be able to have survived and then re-lived the experiences in the form of a book for everyone else to read.<br /><br />The part that got to me most was when she was trying to tell the police officer in Berkeley her name and she said that she couldn't.  She hadn't spoken her own name in 18 years.  That just blew my mind.<br /><br />How these people kept her in captivity, Philip Garrido raping her over and over, including in drugged out episodes, changing her name, pretending as if they were all one big family -- it all just seemed like a story that was made up.  But apparently it was true.  It's very hard to believe all the things that were done to this poor girl, but I am glad it is behind her and she has the chance to live her own life.<br /><br />Excellent book.  Can only read it one time.
B005TQACLC|3.0|Well it isnt the \\"Onyx Hotel Tour\\" filmed by Showtime.....however I expected more from this taping...  There's only two offending causes for me:  The Audio: The producers decided to be lazy and simply cut and paste the cd tracks onto the DVD because they sound identical...they could have at least tweaked them a bit to make them sound \\"acoustic\\" but nope, Instead we get  video footage with horrible cd track dubbing.  The quality: Am I wrong to expect HD quality???? I mean it was professionally shot, was it not?? Yet, the quality is as good as a VHS?? How is that even possible with today's technology?? Also, if you look carefully you can see that they mixed \\"professional\\" shots with shots taken during the concert (you know the one's they show on the screen for the cheap seats) because the quality gets worse.....e.g in \\"Hold it against me\\" when she's in the chair the quality gets blurry and smoky??? or maybe that was just a bad effect?  Besides those factors, it's an ok DVD, but it's sad that the bootleg Las Vegas video online is better....this DVD DOES NOT do it justice...This concert was breathtaking live!! so glad I saw it in Chicago and Milwaukee :-)
B004UUKDNA|5.0|Every song is the album is enjoyable to listen to. I was actually sick of \\"Pumped up Kicks\\" from hearing it on the radio every day, so it's the only song I skip over. Listened to this album over ten times, not even close to sick of it yet

B0061XCZ4E|5.0|To talk about R.E.M. is to talk about an amazing journey of these 4 kids (3 officially after '97) that back in 1980 came up with this little band first called \\"Twisted kites\\" (I bet not many knew that one) and then after a gig at an old church back in their hometown Athens, Georgia the night of April 5th 1980, they decided to changed it to a name we knew for the following 31 years: R.E.M. This review is not to talk about the songs here (that we ALL know) nor the ones that should've been included or the ones that should've been left out. This review is to describe a band through this collection and how their sound changed and went back and forward for these 31 years. The 80's songs (most of them found in the first CD) reflects an indie R.E.M. at the beginning of their carrer, an R.E.M. that was always away from spotlights and cameras during their first decade. And through these years, they always believe in themselves, in what Micheal Stipe thought was the right thing to say in lyrics (eventhough no one understood what he was talking about in most R.E.M. songs). Then on the late 80's and the early 90's, R.E.M. songs and their attitude as a band changed when they moved from this little label (IRS) to the huge Warner Bros. This is when people started to love them or hate them for real. Michael Stipe appearing on MTV with R.E.M. was not something those college fans really wanted to see at first. But then, this little song called \\"Losing my religion\\" (found in the 2nd CD) comes out in their most perfect pop album \\"Out of time\\" back in 1991 and everything... and I mean EVERYTHING changed for Michael Stipe, Peter Buck, Mike Mills and Bill berry forever. They became huge pop stars (something they never wanted to be... Buck declares years later) and with their most beautiful album \\"Automatic for the people\\" people just confirmed who they really were and what they were able to do. Then in 1998, a year later Bill Berry leaves the band claiming he was just tired of it and after suffering an aneurysm in the '95 Monster tour, R.E.M. realeses \\"UP\\" a record that is just ignored by the ones who loved them at first and by the media itself (\\"At my most beautiful\\" is the only song from that album in this collection). Then, for the following years everybody started wondering if it was time for them to \\"call it a day\\" as a band (as Michael Stipe announced last Sept. 21st, 2011). In 2001, they released a just ok record but \\"by an R.E.M. without testosterones\\" said by a reviewer back then. And, in 2004 the least accepted album by them \\"Around th sun\\" is released (honestly I still don't know why the media and \\"fans\\" were so mean with it). Anyway, after the released of \\"Accelerate\\" in 2008 and this year the amazing \\"Collapse into now\\" I believed R.E.M. was about to get back on its feet to release incredible records (eventhough I always loved each and everyone of them because I always found the appealing to each record) but, in Sept. 21st R.E.M. says goodbye to all of us and hence, the release of this compilation. Honestly guys, this is a compilation I didn't need at all but I bought it because as a true fan of them I must buy it being their last \\"new\\" record released ever. That day, Sept. 21st, 2011, I would've loved that Michael Stipe had announced a new record for next year or another world tour but not this. R.E.M. was always a band that kept a special place in my heart way above the rest of the many, many bands that I like. There are three things I will always keep in mind when I miss them as much as I miss them now:<br />1.- Their last show ever as a band was in my country Mexico on November 18th, 2008. A show I attended, so you can imagine now the value that the ticket stub has for me. I'm planning to frame it and hang it on a wall.<br />2.- My band NUEVE. Without R.E.M. this little project I have with a friend of mine would've never existed. I owe them that for sure.<br />3.- What Mike Mills and Michael Stipe said to Rolling Stone magazine lastmonth in an interview when they ask them what made them feel proud when looking back and they said, \\"We did it our way. We believe we always kept the integrity in the band since we started it and we never gave in to anything we didn't want to do. Sure, selling millions of records world wide was great, being inducted in the Rock and Roll hall of fame was also great but, NOTHING can be compared to that\\". Do you know what? They are right.<br /><br />R.E.M.<br />April 5th, 1980 - Sept. 21st, 2011.interview when they ask them what made them feel proud when looking back and they said, \\"We did it our way.

B005D9MUWY|4.0|Keyboard is great. One big problem is that unlike other keyboard apps (stock, Hacker keyboard), there is no way to select a different IME from the SwiftKey keyboard. This is very bad if you like to use apps like Connector or others where you might prefer a different IME.

0385535139|5.0|I'm a big fan of John Grisham's. So far, I've enjoyed all of his books, the present one included.  It is true that, as some other reviewers have pointed out, \\"The Litigators\\" may not be as gripping as some of Grisham's previous works.  The story line and the characters are a bit like the ones you'd find in a Janet Evanovich novel, except with a John Grisham spin to them. Nevertheless, the book is extremely entertaining, fun, thought provoking, and as always well written.  I'd recommend it anytime.
159514188X|5.0|I haven't read this myself, but my daughter just finished reading it and came out and told me I should read it right away and that she cried for 5 minutes after reading it but that it was good. She is a big reader and holds this book in very high regard! That is enough for me:)
B005GVF95O|4.0|There are similar puzzle games that are free but this one is well-designed and is not expensive.  This is great purchase if you have a toddler.  My three year-old nephew loves it.  He has some trouble moving the pieces because he doesn't understand that you can only have one finger touching the screen; I have to hold his hand and guide his finger, but he is getting better at it every day.  Just like another reviewer has mentioned, the app would have benefited from adding animal noises (when a puzzle is completed, for example) and/or having a voice read the name of the animal.  Because of this reason, I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5.
B001DDBCUK|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie and watched it over and over last year on HBO so much that I decided I should buy it :-)  I had friends that never watched SATC series that enjoyed the movie as well.<br />I was excited to see where Carrie, Miranda, Samantha and Charlotte were in their lives and I think they did a great job picking back up.  There was plenty of drama and relationship mayhem that kept it interesting.  One of the things that I loved about the series was that the show was not just about sex/romantic relationships but also about friendship.  Female friendship to be exact and the special bond that women have and the trials they go through.  I loved that the movie also dealt with that.  Miranda and Carrie's friendship was tested and I loved the way Charlotte in her typical \\"Charlotte way\\" showed her loyalty and the way they all rallied around Carrie like true friends do.  I laughed, I cried, I got angry at the characters.<br />I think this is a must for all SATC fans (some may not enjoy as I've seen on other reviews)to catch up on their lives.  Also a must for those that like love stories or movies about friendships.<br />I am still a Carrie Bradshaw fan and will continue to watch this over and over.

B001ZVJ1SA|5.0|I love this book.  I bought it so long ago the pages are yellowing.  For a while, I read it every year or so and understood it more each time.  I just pulled my copy out because I was considering buying it for someone as a gift and so I flipped through it.  While I've come a long way from when I first read it and I now understand it and have, for the most part, assimilated the points, I was reminded how we're never really \\"there.\\"  There's always room to be reminded of those occasions when we get in our own way on the way to becoming fully awake and aware.
0307887898|5.0|Overview: According to Eric Ries, a startup is \\"an organization dedicated to creating something new under conditions of extreme uncertainty.\\" As such, an entrepreneur can be anyone working in his/her basement, a team member in a small company, or someone in a Fortune 500 working on something new when conditions are uncertain. Thus, entrepreneurs are everywhere--not just two guys toiling in a garage with a great idea. Lean startup takes its origins from lean manufacturing and focuses on operating efficiently in a world of uncertainty. To do that, Ries points out that any entrepreneurial company tries to build a sustainable business by conducting \\"scientific\\" experiments that test elements of vision. Entrepreneurs hold faithful to a build-measure-learn mantra. Build a product, test it with customers and measure the results, and then modify it by pivoting or preserving--adjusting the product to meet customer needs or holding steady with the plan. Finally, innovation accounting helps startups measure and hold themselves accountable for steps moving them forward. Startups need not invest enormous amounts of money and time before making critical changes, thus reaching their vision sooner and remaining intact financially.<br /><br />See: Survival Leadership blog for more on this great book.
8857206882|4.0|For some time, I've considered Michael Kenna to be one of the best photographers alive. His use of long exposures and minimalist subject matter is just awesome.  His ability to take a simple, everyday scene and show it isolated from normal space and time gives that scene an 'otherworldly' beauty that can't be described. So when I found this book, I HAD to buy it. I'm very glad I did.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Generally, Sony has one of the most respective headphones production and this one proves the statement. Great sound quality, comfortable settings and convenient price attracts people instantly, thus the value makes it easy to be bought. Represented as \\"classic\\" Sony really maintains its authority and will keep the leadership long time.<br /><br /> Although my main purpose to buy it was learning English, I am really impressed by the headphone because of many positive features that it has.<br /><br /> Firstly I want to mention the box, which was delivered after 2 days since I have ordered it. Silk box with headphone's cover inside astonished me, because the cover was appropriate feature for the beginning. Also it contains two inputs that allows you to put it into the other devices. Unfortunately, I did not have enough time to figure out for what was the second input, but I don't use it till today because the only thing that I use it to is laptop.<br /><br /> Secondly, I like the size because when you wear it, you definitely going through the sound. Distracting sound will never bother you until you put it out from your ears. Surface is soft and pleasant, pretty comfortable for listening the language lessons.<br /><br /> Thirdly, the quality of the sound is amazing, beat is heard clear and frequency is really high. It involves you to unusual sound environment that you will enjoy. It gives pleasure listening to different kinds of media like music, movie sound, and even recording different kind of materials. Thereof I can affirm this device are great tool for study.<br /><br />Finally, I highly recommend Sony Headphone for those who want to feel natural sound, and learning languages while listening to sections, and just enjoy the sound, for less prise that could have other high quality headphones. Be aware of the quality considering the price. Good Luck!
0553801473|3.0|GRRM is going down the same road as Robert Jordan did with the Wheel of Time series.  He started off strong, with excellent pacing, compelling characters, and a clear idea of where he wanted to go.<br /><br />But then...something happened.  Either he lost the thread, or he decided that he was making too much money and that he needed to drag things out, or a little of both.  Because whereas the first three books were some of the finest modern fiction ever written, these last two...aren't.<br /><br />Next to nothing substantial happens. There is precisely one \\"major\\" development towards the end.  There are rumors of other, interesting things happening \\"off camera\\", but GRRM used up too much space describing food to relate those.<br /><br />There'd be plenty of cliffhangers too, if I still actually cared enough about the story to fret about them, and if I didn't realize it'll be at least another 5 years before there's any resolution.<br /><br />Taken on it's own merits, it's not a bad book.  Not great, but not terrible either.  But taken as part of the series that started with AGoT, ACoK, and ASoS, it's simply proof that GRRM fell with AFfC, and hasn't gotten back up again.<br /><br />And now he's talking about how he might need 8 books instead of 7 to finish it?  At the current rate, he'll need 10 or 12.  At the current glacial pacing, it'll take at least 2 and probably 3 more books before the dragons come west, and another 4 or 5 before the Others actually attack.
B000000OF6|4.0|I am a fairly new fan of Queen and these CD's up-graded my experience of their music.  CD 2 contains numbers that I had never heard before and demonstrates their range of music types very well.  Too bad we lost Freddie Mercury otherwise we would, I am sure, had a lot more great songs to enjoy.  I highly recommend this set to anyone remotely interested in listening to Queen perform.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|This \\"ultraviolet digital copy\\" does not let the consumer download a copy to their preferred entertainment software organizer (ie iTunes). They want you to sign up for their stupid service and use their worthless app on your device.   Just when I thought Warner Brothers couldn't sink any lower from only providing digital copies of their movies with expiration dates they go and do this. Boo! I will be avoiding any Bluray disk of Warner Brothers in the future.
B000068NOV|4.0|The Back to the Future films are probably my favorite movies, and I've seen each of them more times than I can remember. I've been in love with the DeLorean since the first time I laid eyes on it, and this miniature is no exception. I opted for this version as it seems to me to be the most iconic appearance of the time machine across all three films. The detail is quite remarkable, down to the Mr. Fusion logo, though my only real nitpick is that it uses the \\"OUTATIME\\" licence plate instead of the orange and silver barcode plate that was in place throughout the second and third films. But as the \\"OUTATIME\\" plate is probably the more famous version I can let this slide.  The only other issues was one of the sideview mirrors falling off when I took it out of the box, and the difficulty is removing it from the not so   decorative \\"stand\\" it was attached to. It also seems to sit a little lopsided, probably due to the mechanism that allows the wheels to change position.  All in all, this is a very nice piece for any collector.

B004S82OAE|1.0|I skipped over the labs and review questions on my first read and then went back to complete them afterward.<br /><br />I got up to chapter 4 before I got fed up because the majority of the answers are wrong. It's hard to know whether I'm doing the right thing because I'm only learning and need to be able to trust the answers to tell me when I'm wrong.<br /><br />It was so frustrating that I stopped reading to write this review. I thought I'd be ready for the exam after doing the review questions and labs, but now I'm not so sure, and I don't want to fail. So now I'm looking for another book to supplement my learning, which is also frustrating because it's going to take longer than I hoped.<br /><br />This was a real shame because the book is very well written and I learned a lot.
B004SBB0LU|2.0|First off - it must be said that Queen is one of my all time favorite bands.  While there were some less than stellar albums along the way, on the whole, this band managed to transcend time and continue to release top shelf material right to the unfortunate end.<br /><br />Per the title, I will not focus on the remastering/overall sound of these reissues.  (I think they sound fabulous).  There are others here who are far more qualified than I to tackle that.  I am solely going to focus on the bonus material.<br /><br />Overall, I am extremely disappointed in the selection, (or perhaps better said - lack thereof).<br /><br />The total running times on the 5 bonus discs are as follows:<br /><br />Queen I - 31 minutes<br />Queen II - 19 minutes<br />Sheer Heart Attack - 15 minutes<br />Night at the Opera - 19 minutes<br />Day At the Races - 22 minutues<br /><br />So all in we get 106 minutes worth of music on five discs that could hold approximately 400 minutes worth of music.<br /><br />Staggering.<br /><br />So what about the material that is on there?<br /><br />For me Queen I is by far and away the best of the bunch.  Hearing the raw demos of 5 of the album tracks with Roger's drums higher and rougher in the mix than usual Queen productions was beyond fantastic.  But where are the BBC sessions?  Where is the song Hangman (constantly played at early shows)?<br /><br />Queen II has a KILLER version of White Queen from the Odeon concert and a very cool instrumental mix of Seven Seas of Rhye where we get to hear the original natural ending.  There are also two versions of See What I've Fool I've Been.  A song that I've never been super crazy about, but it's cool to hear Freddie's different approaches.  But with 60 minutes of space left on the disc, I am left to wonder - why not include more songs from Odeon or the BBC shows?  Why not continue to use your imagination and give us alternate mixes of some of the other songs?  So frustrating.<br /><br />Sheer Heart Attack<br /><br />Another track from the Odeon show (Now I'm Here) which sounds great.  Two more BBC songs which are actually just studio mixes with a different lead vocal.  (Great to hear the natural begining to Flick of the Wrist).  A very cool acapella of Leroy Brown and then an extremely insulting live song from a previously released CD.  (Taking a song from another available album is hardly a bonus track).<br /><br />See above.  SIXTY FIVE MINUTES of unused space.....  SO MUCH material could have been used here.  Outside the obvious BBC and concert material, how about letting us hear Lap of the Gods without Freddie's distorted voice?  That would have been a real treat.  Or how about letting us hear how Now I'M Here naturally ended in the studio.  They were still rocking it out during the fade.  Grrrr....<br /><br />Night At the Opera<br /><br />Previously available Keep yourself retake.  Utterly useless acapella version of the Bohemian Rhapsody opera.  (It pretty much was already acapella).  Two very cool alternate mixes of You're My Best Friend and I'm In Love with my car.  And two VERy cool live tracks from 1977 and 1979.  See above.  How hard would it have been to include an additional 8 to 10 songs from each show on the bonus disc?<br /><br />Day At The Races<br /><br />Very fun instrumental version of Tie Your Mother Down.

B0064J6OMO|2.0|If you are amused by a totally unbelievable story line combined with bad language and crude behavior, like Borat or Hotel New Hampshire, then this movie is for you. The acting is respectable but my wife and I just couldn't stomach the screenplay; it's simply not possible that a lawyer, soon to be partner, could make decisions like those portrayed in this film. It's not possible that their behaviors would have been tolerated by others. My wife and I enjoy a good slapstick (e.g. It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World, Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines and Home Alone) and/or a comedy with a smidgen of thought and depth, but this film is neither.  We turned it off after about 30 minutes and watched The Bachelor with Chris O'Donnell. Itself not a very deep or believable film but we enjoyed it far more.

B002VPE1WK|3.0|I got the bag today. Looks exactly like what you see on the website. It is a good camera bag, but not perfect. It feels not as good as the laptop bags. The design is good, but the material is not good enough, thin and light. And forget about the waterproof, buy a rain cover if needed. Considering the $30+ price, it is acceptable. The only bad thing is the inside material, especially the adhere parts which were used to split the rooms. The material is so hard that you have to be very careful, otherwise your finger will get hurt. I don't know is it the same in the similar canon bags. Anyway, it is not the North Face bag, both the quality and price. I think its worth to have it.

B005RJI67I|4.0|I will be getting this polybag at Christmas as a stocking stuffer. I love the Harry Potter legoes and even though I have every new HP set, we still had to get this one for the creative ways to make a laboratory for the HP universe. Little polybags make a great gift for stockings or special occasions where you don't want to spend a fortune. Better act now until the price skyrockets in the aftermarket though.
B001TI6SOE|5.0|East of Eden is, in my opinion, Steinbeck's opus. I will spare you the praise that everyone has so readily offered and focus on the Centennial Edition itself. I love it. I love the look, I love the binding and the cover, and I love how the pages are sort of roughed and uneven along the edges. It gives the book a unique feel, a character, something that says \\"classic\\" which is what a book should say for this story.   Get the Centennial Edition if you can over the Oprah's Book club edition, which has a big red banner and obtrusive font on it which, I feel, mars the quality of the story that the book holds. I borrowed the original from the library ages ago, and only recently bought two copies for two friends who loved it.
B005J6LKVI|4.0|\\"Courage sometimes skips a generation. Thank you for bringing it back to our family.\\" Skeeter (Stone) moved back home to Mississippi so she can get some experience writing for a paper before she can move to New York. When she gets a job answering letters about cleaning she asks one of the maids for help answering them. A simple job about cleaning turns into something major that changes the course of the town. This is a very difficult movie to watch, but this is a must see. The subject matter will infuriate you and the Hillary character is one of the best movie villains to come along in awhile. For a movie that at its most basic level is about interviewing people for a book it is very engrossing and moves along pretty quick. This is a very emotional movie that will leave you thinking and wondering how you would have behaved in that situation. The cast and acting alone is worth watching for. Emma Stone gives a great performance and is hard to believe this is the same girl that was is \\"Superbad\\". Overall, the first real Oscar contender for best picture and numerous acting awards to come along this year. A definite must see. I give it an A.
B003Y5H556|5.0|I like dark fairy tales and this movie has just the right mixture of horror, suspense, love and beautiful sceneries.  There are some flaws and corny moments, but overall it's a very entertaining movie.
B004EPYZSU|4.0|\\"You, you're going with us. You're gonna use that weapon - it's the only thing that counts. I figure you owe me.\\" Jake Lonergan (Craig) does not know who or where he is. He is also confused by the strange item attached to his wrist. After fighting his way to the town of Absolution he meets the local cattle baron Col. Woodrow Dolarhyde (Ford) who does not like Jake and wants him out. When a machine nobody has seen before attacks the town and the strange thing on Jake's wrist stops it they all realize that Jake is the only hope. I will begin by saying that this is not what I expected. I thought this was going to end up being a sci-fy comedy or a comic book type movie. This was actually a serious western with aliens thrown in, and I really liked it. This is one of the few big budget movies that I have seen that is made better by the casting. Harrison Ford pretty much makes any movie he is in better anyway though. I do have to say that the hype this movie received was too much and had a hard time living up to it, but it did come close. If you are looking for a light-hearted type movie this is not it. This did have a couple slow parts in it but overall this was very entertaining. It may sound strange but this is one of the best westerns to come out since \\"Open Range\\". Overall, a very good western with a sci-fi twist. I give it a B+.
B004EPZ06Q|1.0|If you have a rooted android phone, you CAN'T stream the movies to it because it's a security issue!!! GIVE ME A BREAK!!! Wow.. Just give us back our itunes copies!! I can easily just handbrake the movie for myself! I'm pretty sure studios know this so what's the point of trying to use UV as a solution to pirating. Glad Disney isn't on board for this garbage format!! It's shouldn't be called digital copy. Sure you can't download it but only to your pc or non rooted device but I just can't upload the movie via itunes to my ipad because of these new format.!! How can I stream with no Wi-Fi or data service around? Idiots!! Cloud is only good if there's service...ULTRAVIOLET IS A PIECE OF GARBAGE. SHOULD BE CALL ULTRAVIOLET STREAM.
B005SJIP2S|4.0|Although it's true that a more recent live concert might show a band that is more polished then what is found in Live From Lyon, I really am glad to find Oliver Wakeman on keyboards versus Geoff Downes, no disrespect intended. I just prefer a more classical/progressive keyboards sound versus what Downes offers.  But as far as the music, performances, and sound quality go, there's a lot to like here. Benoit David sounds good although he seems to flub up quite a bit. The background vocals are also kind of rough, but overall the instrumentation sounds solid. Not like Fly From Here this might have a pretty short shelf life, but so far I'm really enjoying it.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|This was a great book, another book I would very highly recommend is [[ASIN:B005LA9G4U Law of Attraction Secrets! How To Effortlessly Attract Money,Love And The Life You Deserve!-Special Edition.]], It costs less, and they did a better job.
B004Y1USV2|3.0|I was initially pretty impressed with Fly From Here but the more I listen to it the more I realize it just isn't deep enough. For one thing I don't like the way they broke up the one big track into many smaller ones. Is it really one track when it sounds like several smaller ones? Not really. Also, the whole album is made up of very good songs but there isn't a single \\"piece\\" on the album.  Compared to Keystudio (check out the studio tracks on Keys To Ascension 1 and 2 if you don't have Keystudio), The Ladder, or Magnification, this is a pretty lackluster effort. I would really like for Yes to either sit down and write their own epics or reenlist Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman (or at least his son Oliver) and do something more substantial.

B0050SYS5A|1.0|Bottom line, the Zoom makes the Kinect, which is already a picky little punk of a device, an even pickier, hard to work with appliance that saps the joy out of game playing before you can even begin to play. I truly wish I could have tried out the Zoom for Kinect before I bought it. Turns out I could have saved myself $30 and a lot of frustration. It's a hunk of junk.<br /><br />Right out of the box, I was in trouble with the Zoom.  The front set of dual lenses snapped onto the front of my Kinect camera, permanently scratching the surface of the camera as it did so. The enclosed literature includes a clear plastic \\"mask\\" to keep from scratching the Kinect - but specifically states that it should be applied \\"if the Zoom is going to be detached and reattached repeatedly.\\" First time out of the box, skrrrriitch - I got a big ol' scratch. So minus a couple of stars within the first 18 seconds of ownership for ruining the surface of my camera.<br /><br />So, Zoom attached to the camera, I find I cannot get the camera to calibrate. Period. With the calibration card, without the calibration card, with back light reduced, with side light reduced, clamping a small desktop floodlight to the front of my TV, wearing a white t-shirt, covering my IR-reflective leather couch with a light-absorbing blanket - you name it, I tried it. My Kinect itself works fine without all this fine tuning but my living room is just too shallow for the camera to work at its best unless I move the couch. In the end, I installed plastic sliders onto the couch because it's literally easier to move the furniture than to get this piece of junk to work as advertised.
B005I6EU48|5.0|I received this as a gift for my Kindle Fire and I absolutely love it. It's soft and looks like a real book. I have gotten so many compliments on it. I know it doesn't completely lay flat like a real book like others have mentioned, but it doesn't stick up either getting in the way of things. If you look at all the Kindle covers, they come with an elastic string to keep the cover tight against the Kindle. This cover does not have that string, but personally I think it doesn't need it. It lays flat enough. I highly recommend this cover if you want an antique look.

1423140591|5.0|Son of Neptune is the second book in the Heroes of Olympus series by Rick Riordan and it follows Percy Jackson in the time prior to the arrival of the Argo 2 at Camp Jupiter.  Please note that I am going to assume that you've read the Percy Jackson and the Olympians books as well as The Lost Hero.  If you've not read those yet- SHAME ON YOU- please read those first otherwise this review will spoil those books for you!So, I should have been tipped off by the title and the cover (which has a picture of Percy) that this book would flash to where ever the heck Percy has been traded to while Jason is hanging out with the Camp Half Blood kids.  However, I did not get the OBVIOUS hint.  I really enjoyed Leo from The Lost Hero so I was sad to see only a tiny cameo from him in this book.  However, we do get two new heroes for Percy to team up with.  Frank is a pretty wicked guy once he really gets comfortable in his own skin and Hazel is connected with my all time favorite character from the PJO books ( he also has a sizable part to play in this book).  Both are interesting characters who are not your typical heroes.  I really enjoyed this book overall and it was nice to hear from Percy again.  His humorous narration is always tons of fun.  I was both really confused and really intrigued by the set up of Camp Jupiter.  Ancient Rome is much more my husband's thing.  (He's spent the last year or more listening to the History of Rome podcasts for FUN!)  But I did enjoy learning about Rome and the way that the two camps differ.  I still like the Greek versions of the Gods best though!  I am worried about how the next books in the series will read now that there are so many characters narrating.  In The Lost Hero and The Son of Neptune, the narrator rotated between the main characters.  I wonder if they will all narrate the coming books.<br /><br />Favorite line:  \\"Cinnamon is good for harpies.  Not cheese.\\"<br /><br />This series is appropriate for middle grades readers but many younger and older readers enjoy them as well.readers enjoy them as well.
B004U8URGA|4.0|This record is one of his best.  I give it four stars instead of five because of tracks 14 and 15.  Dull and typical McCartney.  Rinse the Raindrops is just too long for what it is and Riding into Jaipur is just so much whatever.  As for the rest of the record, it's really good.  I dont think he'll ever write Beatle worthy songs again, but the Beatles were the Beatles and Paul is Paul.  Take them seperatly and you get two sets of really good songwriting.  Very different, but isn't that the point.  Reviewers on here who expect him to still write Beatle-type tunes, need to just stick with their old Beatles records.  Again, there's nothing wrong with that.  But by letting Paul be Paul, we have gotten, over the years, some very good music.  And what good Paul does vastly overshadows the bad.
B004UXUUJE|2.0|I am always amazed to hear that some people like going to those horror chain-saw massacre movies, since you could probably get a cheap seat near a busy highway and end up seeing some pretty gory stuff.  And it is odd to me that people want to view such realism in a story and applaud that, if it has such great acting and such realism as someone having to take a dump in the wrong place, showing you such true life.  Sure, it was great drama and a story that might need to be told,  but should you not tame it up a bit for the big screen and at least have a happy ending of some sort?  Even Schindler's List had some hope, and not as much depressing overwhelming dread, and a good inspiring ending.  I found myself wanting to get a drink and watch any comedy I could find.  Sorry if I offended anyone.
B005WY8YZW|5.0|This album is impossibly good.  I feel like the very best influences of TOOL and A Perfect Circle have been realized and reworked into a passionate artistic statement with this album.  To be honest, I didn't really take Puscifer very seriously - I thought of it as a side project; as a distraction - but this album has absolutely changed my opinion.  I definitely underestimated Puscifer.  I feel like I should know better than to have made that mistake, but I am nonetheless very, very happy to find myself abruptly corrected.
1433502410|5.0|This ESV study Bible isn't your everyday Bible.  It contains references and commentaries to really help you understand the BIble.  We have seen several people in our church come really enjoy this study Bible because it gives them insight into what they're reading.  There are a lot of things in the Bible that is very hard to understand, but with this study Bible it makes it easier for everyday Christians.  This would also make a great gift.
1400079276|1.0|I spotted Murakami's books only recently, and was excited when it came onto our writing program's reading list. So I was pretty happy to be reading this book to begin with - which usually gets me all defensive about what I'm reading....<br /><br />But man! This book is utter nonsense. Magic realism? Hogwash.<br /><br />The writing has way too much exposition, and every character starts preaching philosophy on every second page. It's ridiculous. And the point of the whole story? Who knows? It's utter nonsense! The whole things is written to cater to American audiences (there's even a scene in which these so called Japanese people are going to dial 911)<br /><br />Complete waste of 12 dollars, and I won't be reading any more of Murakami's work again.
B001QERPDO|5.0|I started listening to The Script about a year ago. I bought both of their CD's and was instantly hooked! I have seen them in concert once and I have met the lead singer, Danny O'Donoghue!(Gorgeous and extremely polite!) I have to say that The Script is my favorite band by far! They write, produce, play, and sing ALL of their songs which I admire so much! They are extremely talented artists who came from nothing and have worked hard to get where they are today. I LOVE both of their albums and highly recommend buying either one. Cannot wait until I get the chance to see them again! Until then, Happy Listening :)
1577314808|5.0|When I started this book, I could feel right away that it had a great message to share, a possibly life-changing one, but I was very put off by the dry writing style. Even thought the vocabulary and reading level were quite simple, I still had a lot of difficulty making my way through it. I was reading at a snail's pace due to the quality of the prose. I persevered because I liked the message so much, but I wasn't enjoying the actual reading experience.  After the firs third of the book, however, I decided to only read the book in private and when I had no distractions around me and I was all alone. Suddenly the experience changed. I don't know if the writing improved as the book progressed, if I just got used to his writing style or if being alone and able to give it my full attention is what made the difference, but I managed to read the last 2/3 of the book in a single night and found it riveting and breathtaking. My point is, even if this book doesn't grab you right away, I recommend being patient with it.  I definitely plan to read it again. The advice is so common sense that you realize you knew it all along on some level, which is the highest praise I can give advice: that it's so simple and elementary that we need to be reminded of it every chance we get. Part of me wishes I discovered this book earlier, because then I wouldn't have to learn so many things the hard way, but at the same time the book made me realize that without those hard lessons I'd never have been in the proper mindset to appreciate the teaching of the book, and that in all adversities lie a bright side.  Like Tolle's other books, when this book discusses the ego, it is not so much describing the ego as defined by psychoanalysis, the mediator between the id and the superego, but rather Tolle's ego is similar to the \\"False Self\\" as defined in books by psychologists D.W. Winnicott (\\"Playing and Reality\\") and Alexander Loewen (\\"Narcissism: Denial of the True Self\\"), or the \\"Idealized Self\\" asdefined in books by psychologist Karen Horney (all of them). I recommend also trying their books if you want to see similar terrain explored through the lens of Western psychotherapy.  Highly recommended.

0312323867|4.0|Ok, so I've read both Something Borrowed, and Something Blue, in the appropriate chronological order. While it may be conventional wisdom to side with mousy do gooder low self esteem having Rachel, I find Darcy to be a much more compelling and winning protagonist. I really rooted for Darcy where I spent the whole of Something Borrowed resenting and rooting against Rachel, maybe even hoping for her comeuppance. I just couldn't get behind the idea of this miserable loser making the immoral choice and winning in the end - which surprised me, personally, because normally we always cheer for the underdog.   This is why Giffin did an amazing job in both circumstances - she made both the underdog and the top dog relatable regardless of whichever way the reader might tend to lean in her real life. Although there are moments where you do resent Darcy for being so gosh-darn lucky in life (a rich, handsome British doctor immediately falls in love with this HUGELY PREGNANT woman and has no qualms taking over and playing stepdaddy to some other man's twins - COME ON) and ultimately still getting her happy ending, she is still hugely sympathetic. Besides, Darcy is simply more likeable. Even in Something Borrowed, I never hated Darcy like I think I was supposed to; she was never villainous to me. Yes she is thoughtless and self-absorbed, but in my opinion she is the better person. She is flawed, but she is not hateful. She grows and evolves. You simply have more respect for her. She has high self-esteem, she goes after what she wants in life, she's not meek or timid or pathetic. That is how you approach life - you gotta grab it by the you-know-what, even if you have to suffer the consequences from time to time. In my world, that makes her a better heroine; the best ones spiral and fall from grace in my opinion.  I loved the back story on Darcy and Marcus's affair, even though you can see it is doomed from the start. I actually like Marcus a lot as a character too (not necessarilygoing so far as that I preferred him over Dex [maybe] but, again, I think Giffin does a great job of contrasting the two while avoiding making one more of a villain than the other) and was a little disappointed with his trajectory in this saga. This is a testament to Giffin's ability to show the good and the bad in her characters, making them rounded, human. Unfortunately, there are a lot of writers out there that aren't good at getting inside their own characters' heads. You don't understand them, you don't know why they are doing what they do, they don't make sense. Giffin is great at getting at and even under her characters' motivation (particularly Darcy). It's always great when books help you to understand a type of person that you didn't \\"get\\" before.  I also love that a lot of the suspicions in the previous novel are confirmed in this one. There is an underlying question of how competitive Rachel and Darcy's friendship is, and if, had the tables been turned and Rachel was the one with the great fiancé, Darcy would have kept her hands off (hence justifying Rachel's affair). It was really smooth of Giffin to show that no, she wouldn't have - Darcy couldn't even allow Rachel to have a boyfriend even when she herself was engaged, which sneaks under the radar (never directly addressed) as Darcy's likely underlying motivation for choosing Marcus to cheat with. When you think about it, it doesn't really make sense otherwise that she would have even done it to begin with. Well played.  While it kind of sucked that Darcy had to be exiled from her former life and got the less glamorous ending of the two, I suspect that that had to be done to pacify those that would end up resenting Darcy no matter what - like she got the consolation happy ending. I enjoyed Something Blue more, mostly because it didn't make me sick with disgust and disappointment; it was more fun, more funny, a little bit brighter, which I guess goes to show that in the end the pretty one always does win.

B000050XEI|3.0|I'm a great fan of Enya and have many of her albums.  I bought this CD to rip onto my iPod for use in my car along with the other Enya albums that I have.  It won't rip - clearly, it's got some kind of copy protection.  It works on my CD player but not on my laptop.
0062101897|5.0|This is a great book.  Loved every page. There were some insights into what I didn't know - how they filmed Robbie Coltrane, etc.  In book form they took you through the documentaries that they have on the special editions of the films on dvd, so some of the info was rehashed, but it was complemented by the beautiful artwork and superb photos.  So much care and energy went into creating the world of HP - this book is a great tribute.
1466401885|5.0|I don't often feel compelled to write a review, but I enjoyed this book so much I wanted to encourage others to read it also.  It is such an unexpected book, with is intensely emotional and will have you thinking about it long after you have finished reading it (and if you are like me, you will end up staying up all night to do so!).

B0042X9L6A|4.0|This flash feels really sturdy. It includes a built in small stand, diffuser, and a couple of colored gel filters. I find the menu layout pretty easy and helpful for setting up.<br /><br />After using it for a couple of years, I've noticed a couple things:<br />-The flash and the batteries get hot after taking a lot of shots. It slows it's performance down quite considerably at that point.<br />-I'm a huge fan of the Nikon CLS system. I'll slap the SB700 in a softbox or umbrella and control it via my DSLR.<br /><br />I've used it indoors and outdoors, for portraits and events. Once I learned how to use it properly, I found myself quite satisfied with it. Unless I'm shooting landscape or architecture, I use this flash very regularly.

1451627289|5.0|I have read every single one of King's books beginning with \\"IT\\" when I was 14. I remember being a bit disappointed with the ending. That has happened with several of his books, but not here. Strange that the Author notes in the book that his son \\"helped\\" with the ending. This is a King Classic, but not a Classic King book. It's not  \\"spine tingling\\" or any of the other cliches thrown around about his works. It is simply a great story, a fantastic read. I had a very hard time putting it down (Talk about cliches), and it does grab the reader and take them on a trip through America's history, a history that the \\"Baby Boomer\\" generation should find particularly interesting if they care anything about JFK lore. I am a \\"Gen X'er\\", those born in the early to mid 1970's, and I loved it, even though I did not experience the 60's firsthand. Unlike many of his other works, this could be easily translated into a movie, since it asks for few in the course of \\"special effects\\", or trying to translate King's vision into realistic horror. It is a period piece, a time-travel mystery, a story about the human heart as it relates to the passing of time.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Works perfectly on fire. Accurate forecasts. Easy to use. Best weather app in the Amazon appstore, much better than the weather channel.
0938045695|5.0|This book exceeded my expectations.  All of his advice relative to safety and form is perfect.  If you start with a sufficiently light enough kettlebell and work to master the few but essential movements which are well diagrammed and described in this book, you will definitely see great increases in grip strength, functional core strength, and stability in the shoulder girdle.  As a personal trainer, I was very impressed that I could completely endorse all of his views on programming as well.  His programming style of performing various movements at low reps and high weight for strength with a following conditioning workout of varied intensity with adequate rest is the most efficient way to both increase raw strength and metabolic conditioning simultaneously.  The over the top tough-guy tone comes off as humorous and the book is satirical of the former Soviet Union.  While the Russian Kettlebell Challenge is heavily promoted throughout the book, the raw advertising is only found after the index in the back of the book.
B004L35GAQ|5.0|Like many people I heard the song \\"Sail\\" and was hooked. Awolnation is amazing and the music is super diverse yet all works together in a crazy, beautiful, refreshing way. Aaron Bruno says in interviews he loves Nirvana(he even looks a lot like Kurt Cobain) and I love Nirvana too, but honestly I hear way more Erasure than Nirvana in the music. To me it is Erasure meets Gorillas and I AM IN LOVE with the music and lyrics which is why I would love to see the album become the new standard of what comes out today. \\"Sail\\" got me to buy the CD but I can honestly say that the whole CD is amazing, and it will have you singing and dancing the whole way through. Also Aaron Bruno seems very humble and down to earth in the interviews that I have seen and read, and I think it is important to support anyone that is So Talented yet NOT full of themself. SO EVERYONE, BUY THIS CD!!!
B005M4K94G|5.0|This may be a bad representation of the original so just get the regular cd version. This music  transports the listener to another dimension. Carlos's ability to connect you to the universal consciousness shines here. Listen in a quiet space & away you go. One of Santana's best.

B004SRB2EY|5.0|I find this Vivaldi recording wonderful because I love Ms. Stutzman's contralto voice. I have most of her recordings and since I am not as knowledgeable about music as the reviewer above I did not notice any flaws.  Ms. Stutzman manages great variety of moods and feeling. This voice is like velour,like a glass of Barolo.  Maybe she could do a Galuppi Cd. Is there a lot of music for contralto written by Galuppi still around? Please those who know tell me if this is possible.
B00536OCZA|1.0|This started many years ago with vinyl releases of Division Bell and ever since, the US recordings on Vinyl arent worth buying!

0062011847|2.0|Lady Sybil has finally convinced her husband Sam Vimes to take a vacation away from the city of Ankh-Morpork.  Completely unnerved by the country, Vimes begins to uncover crime everywhere he turns.  The book also tackles the issue of class and social hierarchy as it deals with goblins, a race considered less than human.  Overall, I thought that this book wasn't as good as the other Guard series.  The continual mention of poo and snot seemed to be overkill and took the book into a potty-humor category.  I will still pick up the next Guard book, but with less enthusiasm.
B005C7SXMS|3.0|Perhaps I just wasn't in the right mood when I saw this, but it really didn't do a lot for me: It seems like the story is filled with characters who are emotionally immature and somewhat-if-not-entirely unkind (Oliver, Jordana) and/or those who are so overwhelmed by their situations that they've chosen to become numb to the world (Oliver's parents, Jordana).  As we leave the characters at the end of the film, it didn't seem to me that the characters had really grown all that much.  Perhaps this is trying to be a very realistic portrayl of how the world works, but I guess I look for good stories to be a bit more interesting than what we experience in everyday life.  Heck, I was hoping that everyone would just go their separate ways rather than ending up still together but maybe just a skosh better-adjusted; I couldn't help but to think the characters would have been better off in that situation.  The story is somewhat-if-not-spectacularly interesting, as we get to experience the school year of Oliver with Jordan as well as the mundane working life of his parents (and a bit of Jordana's parent) and the possible re-kindling of an old flame between Oliver's mother and the next door neighbor... while Oliver tries valiantly (if horribly awkwardly) to keep his parents together.    The acting is fine as are the production values -- that's why I'm still giving this 3 out of 5 stars.  I'm thinking this might be better in its book form, where you do have the opportunity to really know what's going on inside the characters' heads?  As-is, I couldn't really recommend the purchase of this movie.
0887307280|5.0|This book is a great read for any business owner, or someone who is about to start a business.  I finally read this book after 4 years of trial and error in my own business and this author is right on in so many ways.
B005D0RDIE|5.0|Recorded in Cleveland, this DVD is perhaps the best that Rush has offered in terms of video quality, stage theatrics and camera work. If you did not see Rush on the Time Machine tour, this is a highly accurate representation of what you could expect to see if you had. Objectively, the set list choice was a decent one and certainly one where classic numbers are going to be included, e.g. \\"Spirit of Radio\\", \\"Tom Sawyer\\", \\"YYZ\\" and \\"Limelight\\". Therefore, if you were just watching this DVD, having never seen \\"Rush In Rio\\", \\"R30\\" or \\"Snakes and Arrows (Live)\\", it would be all brand new. Realistically, on the other hand, it is no different than seeing Rush in concert, 10 or 15 times.<br /><br />The musicianship is excellent and despite reports of Geddy having a cold that night, he delivered a very respectable performance for a highly demanding job. There was much more \\"looseness\\" and clowning around among the three during the show. I suspect that this was recorded at/towards the end of the tour, noting Alex mouthing \\"halfway\\" to Neil Peart during Subdivisions, which marked the halfway point in the show.<br /><br />Clearly, in this performance, Rush exemplified their love for not only their music and fans but the bond between them onstage/off. The comedy skits at the beginning of the DVD, intermission and end are all priceless. Everyone knows that Alex and Geddy can be pretty hysterical on their own....but this time, 'ol Elwood joins in on the fun. Yes, Mr. Peart, everyone knows that you did not lose your sense of humour in life and that you have been able to smile again...most likely because of The Blessed Event mentioned in Far and Away: A Prize Every Time... It is definitely a worthwhile experience to see Neil take part in this.<br /><br />Personally, if the set list was up to me, I would have diversified it a little more. Although I really liked \\"Camera Eye\\", parts of it that were recorded in the studio were just too complex to reproduce live on stage, without using a lot of sequenced parts. I would also say that nearly every album was covered but not all. I also think that Rush has....and this is only constructive criticism, overplayed some of these songs in the last four \\"live\\" albums because four out of the last five albums WERE \\"live\\"....There were two new tunes, BU2B and Caravan which were included on this DVD, which were pretty good. Hopefully, Rush will complete that new album soon and tour again.<br /><br />Another high note for this DVD and huge crowd in Cleveland is the diverse age range of Rush fans. There were many younger people there as well as people who grew up with Rush in their adolescence. It's remarkable to see just how many people have been touched by their music.<br /><br />I recommend this DVD and give it a high-five stars. If you wanted to see Rush on this tour but couldn't....or have just never seen them, you need to have this.uld also say that nearly every album was covered but not all.

0553573403|1.0|First, I should be honest and say I loved the first book. All of the accolades by the other reviewers apply. My frustation ... after reading all five of the books in this serious, I want to ask George, \\"What the hell?\\" Did you get bored with the series? Did you forget which characters you were writing about? Not only is there NEVER any closure, it is if George just loses interest at times. Most of us waited patiently - over 6 years - for book five (Dragons), and it was a huge disappointment. I don't mind books that carry you from one to another, and every book and every story doesn't have to have a nice, neat ending. But holy cow. George, can you leave a character in the middle of a cliffhanger toward the end of one book, then totally ignore them in the next. Come on George, follow up on a thought. Follow up with a character.<br /><br />I loved the first book. Liked the second book. Got frustated with the third and fourth books. And was extremely disappointed in the fifth. At this point, George, I don't care if you do a sixth or seventh book. I am not willing to wait another 10 years to see if you actually know how to complete a thought.<br /><br />My advice to new readers ... just know what you are getting into. This series is just one disappointing, uncompleted cliff-hanger after another.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I finished all 3 levels last month, got great results. Im on my 2nd round now, doing either level 1 and 2 the same day, or doing another one of her dvds No More Trouble Zone, which I highly recommend too. Im a Jillian Michaels believer, the results i've had so far have kept me motivated to lose the weight. Just order Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism dvd after reading great reviews, im sure itll be challeging as well, but like says she gets results.  I did have problems with my knees while doing level 2, but it was because i was doing something wrong. Havent had any issues while doing this round.  One thing i highly recommend is taking before pictures and measurements. I only lost 4 lbs but the difference after looking at pics and measurements were better than i had anticipated.

B005NKIQ26|1.0|Keep your money not a good CD at all.  I didn't like a single song on the CD.  There are better Christmas CDs  much better!
B005RYF5JA|4.0|I just watched the PBS showing of the Believe tour tonight and ... although the PBS showing does not include the entire concert, I thought it might be helpful to at least of few of the people (those who buy at a more reasonable price rather than the PBS price for this DVD), to output a few of my thoughts.  Let me first say that I feel reviewing the `performance rather than the product' is on the edge of impropriety in this particular venue, but many people who read these reviews don't realize that, and actually think that critiquing the performance itself IS what this site was intended to achieve. It is for them that I write this.  It depends on your expectations how pleased or disappointed you will be with this performance. If you have not seen the previous shows, my guess is that you will enjoy this show a lot more than if you have seen their earlier performances. Unfortunately, if you have watched the earlier shows, you will have to overcome the disappointment of knowing that it has been downsized by 20%, following the departure of 2 extraordinarily talented ladies and replacing the two of them with one. There again... it probably isn't realistic to expect the same level of satisfaction. Even beyond the adjustment long time fans must make, (losing two people who close followers had grown to love), it is exponentially harder to fill that void created by replacing two with only one. What could they have been thinking when they made that decision?  It appears as though they tried to fill part of the void by adding a `river dance guy' to dance while Mairead plays the fiddle. Also ... to add some variety, they added some children to the routine in the hope of making it more of an extravaganza. Personally I don't want it to be a variety show when the name of the show is Celtic Woman.  The song selections have changed noticeably, with practically no carryovers from their other tours although Ave Maria has been once again resurrected for this tour. What I find the most bazaar selection though, was when Lisa Lambe sings Black is the Colour. This ballad is normally reserved for male singers, and I think that if sung by a woman, it needs the gender of the lyrics reversed (unless it truly was intended to be made a lesbian rendition).  Another thing about this show is the seemingly unnecessary use of handheld microphones. If anyone can explain WHY they used them please fill me in. For my liking they have no place and no purpose. They are usually used to hide the mouth of a singer who is lip-syncing. It doesn't seem to be explained by the possible audio improvement either. The audio quality was no better using them so that doesn't explain it. And on the topic of audio quality, the PBS special had audio which was much too compressed and it was also highly homogenized to the point where the stereo separation only gives you a small dimensional array (and yes ... I have a sound system which is extremely capable of recreating whatever the signals source has the potential to generate.)  ...........................Now that the DVD has been released, I am amending this portion of my review to appropriately recognize the quality of the DVD itself. I had previously stated at this point in my review (before the DVD was released) that the last DVD (for Songs From the Heart) was inexcusably poor in video quality, even for a standard definition version. The good news is this one is better than the last; the bad news is, it still doesn't do justice to the capability of the source material. The show was recorded in HD for the PBS broadcast and yet there is no HD disc being offered. Two years ago less than half of all homes had HD TV, but now the transition into HD broadcasting has caused a reversal in this statistic, and additionally ... the price of both the TV and the Bluray players is a third of what it was, For this reason it seems truly inconceivable that an HD disc is not even an option. Worst of all, HD TV causes the shortcomings of standard definition quality to be more noticeably. For this reason it is just that much more imperative for this type of performance to be offered in the best quality possible. Two years ago I might have agreed to a coin flip whether or not to go Bluray, but today it's a no-brainer (at least in my mind).  [Enough said about the video...... it is what it is.]  The audio is somewhat better on the disc then what I was experiencing from the PBS broadcast. Whether it is cleaner sounding simply because it has gone through fewer circuit boards or whether it is a different audio mix, I can't say (but in general the audio is improved). One thing I noticed right away was that the shrillness that I heard in Lisa K's voice in the PBS broadcast of the song Follow On had disappeared on the DVD.  Even the expansion of the sound stage is improved to some degree. Unfortunately the amount of compression (lack of dynamic range) of the sound is just as overdone on the disc, and the balance of volume between the singers and the background singers, children's choir, and/or the bagpipers, is at times so far off that the girls are almost being drown out.  The DVD cover says Believe Live but in my opinion that is stretching the truth. Yes it is all done at once (in front of a `live' audience), but some of the audio clearly does not match the video. I mention in my earlier comments `the use of hand microphones' and how they sometimes are used to camouflage lip-syncing; in this show it seems to be the other way around. The `live singing' is done with the hand mikes. As for the rest ...... well you be the judge.  One very welcome addition on the DVD was the song My Heart Was Home Again. Even though it was sung with the distraction of the hand mikes, it was sung beautifully and it didn't have the 32 children, the battalion of bagpipers, the overly loud backup chorus or even the riverdance guy to detract from its beauty. A very welcome surprise indeed!  I hope you find this information worth while. (Please don't forget to read the followup comments by clicking below)

0321704452|5.0|The book, Naked Presenter by Garr Reynolds, provided helpful points about delivering powerful presentations and the proper use of tools and techniques that can be used. The mindset of not to be \\"interesting\\" but to be \\"interested\\" really helped me to understand what naked presentations really are.  It's more than just getting personal or sitting close to the audience with no physical barriers but actually caring about the audience and how they perceive the message. The statement, \\"don't be afraid to call an audible\\", means more than play calling in a football game but reacting and adapting your message to the audience. This book is a great teaching tool and provides ideas for anything that involves sharing information.  I will forever be \\"intimate\\" with my audience from now on.

1401207529|4.0|There was a lot of talk about how Christopher Nolan's bat-franchise was originally based on Batman: Year One. For any bat-nerd, that made it a must read (if you were slow like me and had yet to read it...).  Frank Miller shows why he is a comic book genius as he weaves a quick, strong story surrounding the creation of the Batman. Through his use of gritty, real life style, Miller pushes you through the first year after Bruce Wayne has returned to Gotham, James Gordon has moved to the city from Chicago and the city itself is falling apart.  One of the biggest problems most readers have is the ending. They complain that it is too quick. I disagree. It shows that the end of the year (hence the name...) has come and he has become something more than a human. He is a symbol.  If you are a fan of Batman, or just a fan of the movies, this is a fantastic read that will make you love the universe even more.
0060574216|5.0|This book was suggested to me from our counselor, and it's worth it!  Great book!  This book really puts into perspective the difference in communications between men and women.  Definitely worth the read!
1401232590|5.0|I'm a big old nerd, and over the last few years I have become a huge fan of graphic novels. I finally picked this up (mainly because of the new Batman films), and loved it. It may sound safe to say that The Joker is my favorite comic villain, but it was great to see him as he should be: psychotic. The Long Halloween is a great read for any fan of Batman or graphic novels, as you experience a vast storyline that intertwines a dozen of Batman's greatest villains.  Highly recommend.

0596009208|4.0|I found this to be a very good Java intro book mainly because I was able to resolve most of the author's code errors with what I learned from this book.  It seems as if the style is more of a cross between the 'Dummies for...' and a straight by the numbers tech book but for me I liked it.  It does not cover Java 7 but it is a very good intro to Java.  If you are going to start coding I would suggest you Google 'Notepad++'.  This is a very good app to use to type in your code.  Just set the Language to Java.  As Java is case sensitive I found that most of the errors that I generated were command line case sensitive mistakes on my part.
1451627289|5.0|My expectations were really high when I started this book.  This book not only met my expectations but surpassed them.  This time period (the 60's) has always been fascinating to me.  The politics, Vietnam, the assassinations and the music has always been interesting to me.  I love reading stories both fiction and non-fiction about this era.  Stephen King's book is one of the best I have read about the  1960's.  To be honest, this book is really one of the best I have ever read.  I felt like I was there.  I know that sounds corny but it really is true.  This book is spectacular.  It is a must-read.
B0034G4OZE|5.0|It's Kind of a Funny Story was kind of a funny story.  I thought it was a great read and ranks up there with Twisted and Speak both by Laurie Halse Anderson.  I am 40+ and I often read YA or teen fiction and then recommend the good books to my teenage children.  I told my son he would like this book even better than the Perks of Being a Wallflower which up to now was his favorite book.  He did end up liking It's Kind of a Funny Story better and now it is his favorite. I've always stressed that just b/c you are attractive to a person doesn't mean that person is a good fit for you especially if that person has no depth.  This point is one of many good points that this book makes. I think many teens will be able to relate to the main character's issue.  It is a serious issue which the author manages to address without being too depressing and it's \\"kind of funny.\\"  I highly recommend this book.
1612130585|5.0|This book starts off a few days after the first one ended. Ana is literally a mess! She has not been eating or sleeping. She cannot stay focused and practically could make a river out of all the tears she has shed. Her roommate, Kate has gone on vacation and Ana is left feeling very lonely and with no one to talk to. I hated to see Ana this way! I was heartbroken for her and wanted to smack Christian upside the head!<br /><br />Christian still offers to go with Ana to Jose's show and without any other options, Ana accepts. Christian comes up with a new relationship plan for them and Ana finds herself not being able to say no to him again.<br /><br />I absolutely loved Christian in this book. He is trying so hard to fight his demons and show Ana that he cares for her. Ana was a pistol, she was able to stand up for herself on many occasions and try to show Christian that she can make decisions on her own. The email bantering was yet again ongoing and I enjoyed every minute of it!<br /><br />Fifty Shades Darker showed the reader much more into the past of Christian and helped Ana come to terms with Christian's ex \\"subs\\", with a few twists of course.<br /><br />The sexual scenes were a little more intimate in this book, but don't despair, there were plenty of them. I am very much looking forward to the next and final book in this series, Fifty Shades Freed, coming in January 2012!
1591840562|3.0|I was misled by the subtitle: The Time-Tested, Battle-Hardened Guide for Anyone Starting Anything. Inasmuch as the book devotes extensive attention to pitching to investors, raising capital, recruiting CXO-level people, bootstrapping, and related big-startup topics, this is clearly not a book for most small businesses. Nor is it a book for solo practitioners like myself. Nor, definitely, is it a book about starting projects, which the \\"anything\\" in the subtitle would seem to include.<br /><br />This book primarily targets entrepreneurs seeking to start a major company. I'd advise anyone who fits that category to read this book and to carefully follow its advice.<br /><br />As for myself, I found it an interesting book to skim, but of little practical value. Still, early in the book, there are some gems that small business owners can benefit from, such as being able to describe your business in very few words. And I fully agree about the shortcomings of most mission statements: they're wordy, overly broad and not memorable.<br /><br />One thing I did appreciate was the section on tips for creating effective presentation slides, such as using only one level of bullets (if you must use bullets) and  animating your body, not your slides. As the author of a book on presentation skills for technical professionals, I would have referenced some of these tips if I'd known of this book when I was writing my own.<br /><br />Guy Kawasaki is an authority on building big companies. IF that's your goal, read this book (and perhaps also the books listed in the Recommended Reading in each chapter). Otherwise, there are other books you're likely to find more useful.
1612130283|5.0|After I had read Beautiful Disaster, and Loved it, a few friends suggested that I read this book. I am going to try to put into words my feelings on this book because honestly, I am still reeling!<br /><br />After starting, I could not put it down. I stayed up until 4 am just to finish then had to proceed to take a cold shower! The whole time while reading in the back of my mind I could not help but think \\"man, my husband is so boring!\\" LOL!!!<br /><br />From their very first meeting, Christian and Anastasia feel the sexual tension. He is easily amused by her and she finds him very arrogant and frustrating. She cannot wait to get out of his office and run for the hills, thinking of how lucky she is that she will never have to see him again. Even though she cannot get him out of her head. Until he shows up at her job, things just spiral from there.<br /><br />I immediately liked Ana. She is young, innocent and sweet. I really was torn for her through out the whole book and understood her need to stay with Christian, even though he seemed like the last thing she needed.<br /><br />Christian has many demons and secrets hiding behind his walls. He is so private and it tended to be very frustrating wanting to know more about him. He was abandoned as a child by his prostitute/addict mother and had been adopted. He does not like to discuss his past, but it still tortures him daily and it affects his ability to love.<br /><br />Christian takes Ana on a downward spiral of sex, pain and infatuation. There were many things that bothered me about Mr. Grey, but the most would have to be his stalker nature. I found it odd that he was able to find Ana on a moments notice. I think that would personally make me a little skeptical.<br /><br />My favorite part of the book was Ana & Christian's bantering emails back and forth. They made me giggle and just seemed so realistic.<br /><br />The sex scenes in this book left me breathless and blushing! Definitely NOT YA in the least which is unusual for me to read. I guess that I was intrigued??? Enough so to run right out and get book 2! I cannot say enough about this series, it is one that you just have to experience for yourself.run right out and get book 2!

B005DF2QMC|5.0|Unbelievable!  far superior than what I expected.  This product does a lot more than I thought it would, easy to use, quite impressive.
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|George Clooney's character, Matt King, is quick to point out that even living on an island paradise doesn't exempt one from exposure to the kinds of messed-up crap that inflict everyone else. Life in its essence is the same for the inhabitants of Hawaii. You just live it wearing colorful shirts, shorts, and sandals. THE DESCENDANTS certainly has its laugh-out-loud bits, but mostly it's a drama about loss and grief and acceptance and all that superfun stuff. And if I were to gauge this film's quality by how often I heard guffaws and sniffles in the theater I went to, then THE DESCENDANTS has earned some big bragging rights. And maybe an Oscar nod for Clooney, and maybe another one for a superb young actress, Shailene Woodley. Both of them anchor the film.<br /><br />Clooney inhabits his role with a thoughtfulness and an intelligence that not too many of his contemporaries could've matched, and every so often he's not afraid to play the fool (did you check out his goofy jogging?). Mostly, attorney Matt King is just trying to keep his head above water, as he juggles several pressing issues. As the sole trustee of the family's highly coveted ancestral land, there's pressure from his sprawling cast of greedy cousins to sell. Matt is also trying to keep his two troubled young daughters in check, never mind that he views himself as the back-up parent. Most painfully, his comatose wife, Elizabeth, had suffered a grave boating accident, and it's only a matter of time before the plug is pulled, in accordance to her living will. And if you've seen the trailer then you know that his foul-mouthed oldest daughter, Alexandra (Woodley), springs a huge shock on him. In one of her frequent raging tantrums, she informs him that his wife had been cheating on him. Because even paradise sees its share of rocky marriages.<br /><br />Clooney's restrained performance is compelling and I love his acting choices, the things that he does and how he expresses his dialogue (and there's plenty of dialogue). But I knew Clooney could act. Shailene Woodley is the revelation. Even more than Clooney, Woodley, angry and conflicted and forceful, provides the story's emotional impact. It's a splendid cast across the board, really, from Amara Miller (who plays Matt's ten-year-old daughter Scotty) to a surprisingly grown-up Matthew Lillard to Judy Greer who is absolutely fantastic as the wife of the man cheating with Elizabeth. Nick Krause steals several scenes as Alexandra's st0ner surfer boyfriend Sid. Sid accompanies the Kings as Matt, Alex, and Scotty go island-hopping in search of the elusive other man in Elizabeth's life. I guess it's one way to cope with the impending loss of a loved one. Sid starts out as this oblivious tool but later demonstrates unexpected levels of insight and loyalty. One of Matt King's voice-over observations is that in Hawaii \\"the most powerful men look like bums and stunt men.\\" In a tiny but pivotal part, Beau Bridges plays one of Matt's laid back cousins, and it's worth it to see Bridges not missing a beat as he goes from affable to affably menacing.<br /><br />Hawaii provides a picturesque backdrop, and it's maybe jarring that we're watching this sad family affair unfolding on an idyllic island paradise. Or maybe that's the conflicting emotion director Alexander Payne was going for. A certain askewed perception. Grief looks a bit odd when the mourners are always dressed for a barbecue. Ultimately THE DESCENDANTS is frank and honest, and sometimes brutally honest. I like that it doesn't pander or try to be cute. The story runs the gamut of laughter and tears, and there's something rewarding in watching Matt and his kids pull together. Elizabeth, the dying wife and mother, is portrayed as a complicated real person, and not put on a pedestal, or not much, anyway. We become privy to her virtues but also to her faults, and the film suggests that Matt, too, is not without blame. And Payne doesn't shy away from exhibiting the degenerative physical toll exacted on a failing coma patient. Each of Matt's visits to the hospital documents Elizabeth's further wasting away. Which sort of wends back to Matt King's point early on. There's no escaping life; it comes with heavy baggages; and death even in paradise is the great leveler. But it's hard to console yourself with that. Me, I'd probably act out, like Matt's kids.hysical toll exacted on a failing coma patient.

B00479SVBU|5.0|I had been using a \\"cheapy\\" FM transmitter for use with my MP3 player (my otherwise good car stereo doesn't have an MP3 jack).  However, I was getting muddy and distorted sounds on certain songs.  I finally realized that I was over-driving the input capacity of the cheap FM xmiter.    Tested the FM Transmitter portion of the Soundfly AUX MP3 Player Car Fm Transmitter and no longer have this problem.  In addition, the Soundfly does a lot more that the cheapy did.  I haven't tested all of the features yet so can't comment on those but am quite happy to have my main problem solved.

B00000K2UX|5.0|If my CD of the Top Gun soundtrack had been a vinyl record, it would be completely worn out by now. I've played the Top Gun soundtrack hundreds of times over the years, and I never tire of it. I like all the tracks, but my favorite is the pulse-pounding \\"Danger Zone\\" by Kenny Loggins. A close second place would be Cheap Trick's \\"Mighty Wings\\" and \\"Through the Fire\\" by Larry Greene. And I've lost count of how many times I've played \\"Hot Summer Nights,\\" which is still my favorite piece by Miami Sound Machine and Gloria Estefan.<br /><br />There's not a throwaway track on the album; it's all goodness, and probably the finest soundtrack album of the 1980s.
0553584537|5.0|Riveting. Overall a wonderfully written suspense thriller. Starts off with a question and ends with a question. Interesting characters with secrets and a past that keep you enthralled. Not exactly a who-dunnit mystery but a great psycho-thriller that urges you to continue reading to figure out the \\"why\\".
B005HP2J66|3.0|Famed director Werner Herzog makes rather a mess of what should have been a straightforward documentary about a series of cave paintings found in the Ardeche region of France. The paintings themselves are beautiful renditions of mammonths, rhinos, wild cats and especially horses. The problem is that there aren't that many of them, so the film shows us the same pictures again and again and again. The crew clearly ran out of ideas and start introducing odd characters, such as the perfume expert who tries to sniff out caves from the outside. Herzog spins out the film with flights of fancy such as imagining that when cavemen looked at the flickering drawings, the effect would have been the same as watching an old Charlie Chaplin film. He ends the documentary with a bizarre shot of albino crocodiles living not far away in a zoo heated by a nuclear power station. Cave of Forgotten Dreams -- which runs a good 15 minutes too long at 97 minutes -- is worth watching for the pictures, though.
1936850028|5.0|I was going to wait to review this book until I was completely finished reading it, but I know for a fact that I would recommend it already. I didn't realize that this book was a memoir when I was asked to read and review it. I don't read memoirs...ever! I was so surprised at how captivated I was by the author's retelling of his experiences and how passionate someone can be about something. I am finding it very motivating in my own life! I enjoy cross-country running. I'm not that good, but this book makes me want to keep trying and training. It's very well written, entertaining, and laugh out loud funny! I have cross-country skied only once in my life...on my honeymoon, almost 21 years ago. This book makes me want to cross-country ski again!   Thank you Mr. Rhein for making the first memoir I have ever read a very enjoyable experience!

0982743726|5.0|As an avid reader, I spend any free time I have with my nose in a book.  I found The Bone Sword to be a fun, fast paced, and entertaining book that I did not want to put down! Some nights I stayed up late to read just one more chapter, only to want to read even more when that chapter was finished. I loved the characters, the story and the fast paced action! One particular scene has stuck in my mind since reading this book several months ago, it was so gruesome, yet I found myself reading it over and over. An excellent read! Totally recommed!
B005HGZVEM|3.0|I have enjoyed Isaak's music in the past. I purchased this cd based on history & a review in the local paper. I was disappointed. There is a monotomy to this album that takes away from  his talent. I found the album boring.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I have been waiting for this for some time on blu ray and have not been disappointed. The blu ray transfer is incredible. It's Like watching the saga for the first time. I'm one of those who seen the original Star Wars IV in the theaters several times. I have also seen all the re-releases in the theaters as well. I don't know what most of the people's problems are giving a one star as their review, other that they are traditionalists. George Lucas did very well in the re-releases and he got most to of what he originally wanted to do with some of the scenes. I cannot imagine seeing the original release without the redo's on blu ray, I wouldn't have paid the money. If you have a problem with this then keep your VHS tapes in good shape because that is the quality that you will be watching. I feel the same way about TLOR which I now have on blu ray. The only thing George Lucas can do better is the remake of the original three, this will not surprise me. I'm sure that would make the traditionalist very unhappy.
0545265355|5.0|I'm so, so glad that curiosity and the mention of \\"The Giver\\" got the better of my disdain for contemporary YA fiction. The numerous comparisons to how great these books were, how they were \\"just like Twilight!\\" made me write them off entirely because I don't pay for terribly written fanfiction but oh my.  These are fantastic books. Suzanne Collins' characters have depth, are believable and are likable. They are gutsy, intelligent, and worth caring about. Katniss is a protagonist worth rooting for and the Capitol an antagonist worth despising.   Each of these novels will be the best two or three hours you'll kill in an afternoon.   I realise that too many people to(dis)count love the hell out of Stephanie Meyers' books, but for the LOVE OF GOD please stop comparing good books and good writers to her drivel and, at best, mediocre talent.

I actually took the time to listen to this album and a few others from them, and out of all 4 i listened too, this one is the worst.  I swear, MTV keeps putting out worthless crap all the time.  If you have even a slightly decent taste in music, don't waste your money on this trash.  Oh yeah, almost forgot, the song \\"the bitter end\\" is a total ripoff of Metallica's \\"battery\\".

Their friendship was true and their love was true. It wasn't meant to be an Oscar nominated movie. It wasn't made for the masses. It was made to simply touch your heart. It sent me back to days long past and it made me remember. It isn't for people who only want happy endings. I found out too late, but that didn't change my opinion of this movie. To sum it up in three words -<br />Simple, touching and nostalgic.
B00005ASHM|5.0|I have always considered the Beach Boys to be a fun group with some outstanding harmonies and some catchy tunes, but really not much more than a glorified boy band.  As a kid I had a couple greatest hits LPs and had fun with them.  But they never held a candle to the Beatles, who are without a doubt, the greatest ever.  I kept seeing Pet Sounds show up in Top Album polls and surveys, so I decided to grab it finally last year.  I listened to it a couple of times and really didn't see what the hoopla was all about.  There were a couple decent songs and that was it.  The rest was boring and uninspiring.  Then I listened to it a few more times.  And then I listened to very little else for a while.  The album had me.  After further review, I consider it a masterpiece.  I admit that some of this is after looking at it from a 1967 perspective.  I looked at what it would have meant at the time and how groundbreaking it was.  Then I started to do some reading on Brian Wilson.  He basically did this all himself.  He didn't have a John Lennon to team with.  He didn't have a Sir George Martin to produce.  He ran the boards himself.  He did the arrangements himself.  He wrote the songs with very little help (some from Peter Asher and a very small amount from that idiot Mike Love.)  This was basically a one man-show.  And reading what happened to Brian as years passed; the betrayals, the mental illness, the complete lack of support from his band etc. I have grown to appreciate this album all the more.  I like every song.  I love several.  The only ones I don't love are the ones that feature the near-talentless, litigious, buffoon that is Mike Love more than I'd like.

1451627289|5.0|I usually tend to be wary of Stephen King books, since so often they start off very well and then veer too off course for my liking.  I kept expecting that diminishing return with \\"11/22/63\\", especially given its length, but this book was simply captivating.  While the main storyline does clearly revolve around time travel and changing the course of history, the book's underlying tone is a reflection on how different the world was in 1950s, and despite all of our progress today, it doesn't necessarily mean it's better. I enjoyed the set-up to the rest of the story, with Jake's trip to Derry, Maine, and even more so, I loved his time in small town Texas, meeting all the characters and being touched by their genuine kindness towards one another.  The only part of the book I liked the least was when Jake/George is doing his final research on the General and Lee Oswald. While very critical to the story, I missed the small town folks he left behind and felt the story dragging a bit.  This is only a minor quibble, since the story picks up once again and brings it all together.   I also applaud King for the conclusion of the book, which could have ended in a variety of disappointing ways or been a cop-out to avoid any explanation of everything that happened up to that point.  Instead, King's conclusion is explanatory, realistic (as much as it can be), and sentimental.  After investing all the time to read the entire book, I was happy to close the book entirely satisfied.   This is by far one of the best books I've read in years.  I recommend it to anyone who can suspend some disbelief by indulging in the \\"What if?\\" of time travel and contemplate what it would be like to have lived a different life.
B005YVTHT0|5.0|If you've ever fired up your iWhatever to play Asphalt 5 or Need for Speed, then you know what this is all about.  This is an accelerometer driven racing wheel.  At first, it does take a little getting used to.  There is no resistance whatsoever to turning this wheel.  I don't mean force feedback, but rather that you can tilt the wheel, and you can start turning yourself away from the screen without anything stopping you.  Once you get used to that, the wheel is very responsive, as are the gas and brake pedals, located just behind the wheel.  Also, while the controller isn't wireless, it has a substantial and pretty long USB cable to attach to the computer.  There are a LOT of controls on the wheel, but most of them don't actually do anything, so you needn't worry about them.  For example, you have a horn button, but it does nothing, so no worries.  All this is in service of an online game called Sim Raceway.  I would recommend you try Sim Raceway ([...]) first to see if you even like the game.  It has super realistic physics, and the courses are fun to drive.  There is an in-game marketplace where you can purchase upgrades, and the wheel controller comes with a $10 card towards these upgrades.  About the only problem with Sim Raceway is that, while it is an online racing game, it doesn't appear to have any customers.  I have sat for over 20 minutes waiting for other drivers to join, only to give up and leave the game.  I have yet to have a multiplayer race.<br /><br />UPDATED:  Thanks to helpful commenters here, I have managed to get this wheel to work with GRID and NFS Porsche Unleashed.  It works well (except with GRID, but that is because the cars in GRID are uncontrollable, not because the wheel has a problem).

B004Y1USJE|2.0|Now, before you press that \\"not helpful\\" button simply because I gave this album two stars, hear me out. I am a lifelong Yes fan, and they are my all-time favorite band (Dylan is my all-time favorite artist, Yes is my favorite band). I love these guys, and I have all of their albums. I saw this incarnation of Yes at the Tower Theater in Philadelphia last year (with Oliver Wakeman) and hung out with all of them backstage for quite awhile. I've always loved these guys, and I loved every album this band has released (including 1980's 'Drama,' 1987's 'Big Generator,' 1991's 'Union' and 1997's 'Open Your Eyes').  Until this one.  Look, I'm going to come out and say it, 'Fly from Here' blows. Yes, the Roger Dean cover art is great, and the funky Yes logo design is quite nice, but the music just isn't what it once was. The playing is alright, but it is not what it should be for musicians on this level. Benoit David is an okay singer, but I've come to the conclusion that he simply does impersonations on stage. He sounded alright the night I saw him, but he's either impersonating Jon Anderson or he's impersonating Trevor Horn (as he does here). Don't get me wrong, he's talented, and he's a nice guy too, but he just doesn't have much personality as a vocalist. That, for me, is a problem.  And then there is the production. Trevor Horn, in my opinion, is one of the best producers of the modern era. His work on '90125,' ABC's 'The Lexicon of Love,' and the Art of Noise records are just phenomenal. The guy is simply a genius as a producer. But on 'Fly from Here,' the production sounds very stale and quite amateurish, like he is using a GarageBand like computer program instead of proper production techniques. Considering all of the wonderfully produced records being made in this day in age (like Radiohead's 'The King of Limbs'), there is absolutely no excuse for a band like Yes to have an album this poorly produced, ESPECIALLY coming from a first-rate producer like Trevor Horn.  The songs are also somewhat of a disappointment. A previous reviewer described this really as a Buggles album, with Benoit David singing and Steve, Chris, and Alan playing along and occasionally throwing something in. To some extent, that is true. Steve Howe does get a solo piece here which is quite nice (I personally prefer 'Masquerade' from 1991's 'Union,' but that's just me), but the rest of it just doesn't seem to fit Yes very well. 'We Can Fly from Here' is a track that has been floating around since 1980, and it was even performed on the 'Drama' tour (a live version of it recorded at Madison Square Garden in New York in September of that year was released on the 2005 'The Word is Live' box set). Really, extending the track into a 22-minute suite just wasn't smart. The track worked brilliantly as a 6-minute tune, and if it were recorded on this album as it was performed on the 'Drama' tour, perhaps I wouldn't object to it. But trying to stretch it out into a lengthy epic suite like 'The Gates of Delirium' and 'Ritual' (and shortening it's title to 'Fly from Here') is just ridiculous. 'Life on a Film Set' could easily have appeared on the Buggles' 1979 album 'The Age of Plastic,' and 'The Man You Always Wanted Me to Be' is somewhat sappy, surprising coming from Squire. His voice doesn't sound bad, but the lyrics just aren't good.  Don't get me wrong, I do like the Buggles. But if I buy a Yes record, I want to hear Yes. I don't want to hear the Buggles. That why I bought 'The Age of Plastic.'  The final complaint I have is that Geoff Downes just doesn't click with Yes anymore. He is an ideal fit in Asia, with Wetton, Howe and Palmer, but in the 2011-present version of Yes, he just doesn't blend. He was right for Yes in the early '80s, but for some reason, he just doesn't seem to be on the same page as the rest of the band nowadays. He is a stellar keyboardist (one of the best), but he just seems out of place in the new Yes.   Look, I'm all for Yes trying new things, but this album just doesn't work. It isn't well produced, it's not well written, and in 20 years, when one is making a list of what they would consider classic Yes songs, let's be honest, NONE of these songs would even be contenders. This album is the first time I have ever felt disappointment from my favorite band, and I hope it is the only time. If this were some other band, maybe this record wouldn't bother me. But I was expecting so much better from musicians like Yes.  I recommend the album 'The Living Tree,' by Jon Anderson & Rick Wakeman, which is also new for 2011. While that record is far more stripped down, it is well produced, it is far more intimate, and it is also better performed. That is the record Yes fans should be buying. 'Fly from Here' isn't. Buy 'The Living Tree' before 'Fly from Here.'  Overall, this record was such a letdown to me. Like I have said, it is the only Yes album that has left a sour taste in my mouth. I hate to jump on the bandwagon (especially because I am such a fan of the 'Drama' album), but this group needs Jon Anderson back desperately. Peter Frampton also played the night I saw Yes, and he definitely outperformed them that night. But that's irrelevant. The new record just isn't what it should be. I had such high expectations for this band's first album in 10 years. This album was well below my expectations.  I know I'm going to get a lot of unhelpful votes for this, but honestly, stick with the Yes albums you already have. If you don't own 'Fly from Here,' take my word for it: you aren't missing much.
B0001WTVUW|1.0|First, I want to say that, in my view, it is a shame that a much more affecting and much more realistic film depicting the effects of nuclear war is less readily available to Americans than it should be.  \\"The Day After,\\" insofar as the true horror of nuclear war is concerned, is pretty much sentimental tripe, a drama of nuclear war that is (deliberately?) pain-free for the American audience which very likely does not really want to know how truly horrific nuclear war would be.  Big name actor, Jason Robards, and others in the cast, assured the attention of American audiences for the televised premiere of this candied and truly fake version of nuclear hell.    \\"Threads,\\" which on Amazon is only available on DVD for Region 2 or on USED VHS deserves more critical praise than the American fluff and should be made available to American audiences more easily than it is.  \\"Threads\\" presents a grimly real picture of nuclear war's aftermath.  For an example of an effective and raw presentation of the grim reality of nuclear war, the main character, a woman, has visited her parents, who are sheltering in the cellar of their home.  When she goes into the cellar, she finds her father embracing his newly dead wife, wrapped in plastic garbage bags, and weeping.  Too painful for Americans?  Too hard on their touchy feelings?  Later, the daughter returns to check on the father, and when she opens the door to the cellar stairs, she is repulsed by the odor of rotting bodies and the sound of hundreds of flies.  It's brutal, but it is more realistic than anything in \\"The Day After.\\"  Even the title of \\"The Day After\\" is a deceit and a lie.  There IS no \\"day after\\" a nuclear war, and if anyone is trying to tell you that there is, they can only be trying to make you believe that nuclear war is viable and that there will be a future afterwards in which we will all hug one another and get over it.  It seems to me that \\"Threads\\" tells a much more truthful tale.  \\"The Day After\\" is simply asales presentation for the ghouls who run the American war machine.    See \\"Threads,\\" if you can find it.  You will understand precisely what I have said here.

1573226521|3.0|I remember this movie being a stinker so I only reluctantly picked up the book.  I was pleasantly surprised that it is quite a bit better if still not great.  The author was in his early 20s when he wrote it and it shows.  The writing is good it's just a bit juvenile in parts.  Overall it's a pretty solid adventure with a great location.  I might be tempted to check out some more of Garland's books.

0345533054|4.0|[[ASIN:0440245907 Tell No One: A Novel]]  was my first Harlan Coben novel and IMHO it was an amazing tale.  Coben is clearly a gifted writer, with a good sense of what it takes to grab your interest and hook you, and then keep you going until the last page .... and then some.  However, having started with Tell No One, Gone for Good seemed like a reformulation.  Hero is a grieving man whose beloved family member is dead ..... or are they? Check. Psychotic killer using grossly innovative ways to kill?  Check.  Gung-ho law enforcement types convinced the hero knows more?  Check.  Fascinating no nonsense side-kick?  Check.  Toss in a few improbable coincidences and there you go.  I would give \\"Gone for Good\\" three-and-a-half stars because it WAS a really good read, but the plot seemed a bit too similar, and I wish the main characters (in each book) had been a bit-more fleshed out and developed.  Your results may vary .......
1451627289|1.0|I love books about JFK and anything to do with time travel. And I've enjoyed much of Stephen King's previous work.  I hated this.  In fact, it might be the worst book I have ever read.  King takes what is ostensibly a very interesting premise, full of potential, and drags it through 700 pages of corny characters, clichés and overly sentimental drivel. All too rarely does he offer a glimpse of the dangerous political underbelly that sprung from the paranoia of a country in the midst of the Cold War and civil rights movement.  Instead, most of the book is filled with infuriatingly repetitious accounts of small town American life. Portraying the mundane and everyday has it's place of course. It is vital to creating a vivid and realistic picture of the past. But there is only so many times the reader can be put through lengthy tales of local dances and variety shows before the whole thing starts to grate.  And then, there are the loves scenes.  Oh dear God, the love scenes...  Unreservedly, the most excruciating and embarrassing portrayals of sex I have ever been subjected to. Given the choice, I think I would rather walk in on my elderly parents engaging in the most naked kind of wild thing than suffer through these scenes again.  Finally, you will never want to see the words 'harmonic', 'obdurate' or 'poundcake' ever again in your life.  If only there was a portal in my local diner where I could go back in time and warn myself never to buy this book.
B0064J6OMO|5.0|Loved the movie, hard to believe people would rate this lower than a 3. They must not have a sense of humor. Get this one, and enjoy it.
0316098329|4.0|The book arrived faster than expected, and was in good condition.  However, it had to be the worst book I have ever read.  I will say that my bookclub finally discussed the book, for once.  Everyone else loved it.  A poorly written book.  I would definately buy from this seller again.  thanks.

0307454541|5.0|I downloaded this book to my Nook and after about 3 chapters it started to get interesting. Lisbeth is a very engaging character in the story. She's a very strange independent person that doesn't let anyone get in her way. The plot was really good too. I was actually shocked near the end of the book. I've downloaded the last 2 books to my Nook and am reading the 2nd book right now. Its better than the first book because it starts out at a more faster pace and you don't have to be introducted to the character like you did in the first book. It was worth the money to buy it. I can't wait for the movie to come out. I hope its like the book.

B002OSY2T6|4.0|My daughter has had this toy since she was 2 months old.  She first loved that it made noise and had a mirror which kept her distracted enough for a good amount of tummy time .  Now she is 7 months and loves to push it around and make it light up.  I am sure soon she will be rolling it everywhere and running after it.  This is a great affordable purchase for a child to grow with.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I have seen this movie multiple times, and I love it more each time I watch it, so I finally decided to buy a copy for myself.  The shipping for this product was very prompt (which made me very happy!), and the DVD arrived in fine quality -- no scratches, no hiccups in the playing of the movie.  I was very satisfied with the company's business.    The only thing wrong with this copy of the Jane Eyre movie is that there are basically no extras.  I went ahead and bought this copy anyway, even though I had been searching for an alternate copy that included extras on it and had been unable to find it.  I've heard that the UK edition includes extras such as the deleted scenes, so for those people who are movie junkies, I would recommend trying to find the bonus edition before purchasing this one.  But all in all, I was pretty happy with just the movie.  I think this is the best rendition of Jane Eyre out there (and believe me, I've seen 5 different renditions!).  Although Toby Stevens is too handsome for the role of Mr. Rochester, he captures Mr. Rochester's personality perfectly, and Ruth Wilson is superb as Jane (just how I imagined her).  Some might complain that Ruth Wilson is too pretty for the role as well, but I think she has more of a unique than a pretty look -- a different but captivating kind of beauty.  Very elfish.  The music is beautiful, the filming is crystalline, and the whole film is just a treat.  Thank goodness they made the movie 4 hours long so they could include as much of the novel as possible.
B003UD7JEE|5.0|Just finished watching season one of NIKITA on DVD and thoroughly enjoyed it, and am glad the series has been renewed for season two.  The stories are good, the plots are great, and the action is fantastic.  That said, I don't know why Division has so much trouble with Nikita.  Yeah, she causes trouble for the diabolical and power hungry Percy, and sabotages Division's missions, then escapes their clutches at the end of every episode.  However, if Division really wanted to capture Nikita, it's not that difficult.  As all us avid TV action series viewers know, CTU answers to Division and the director of Division could easily order CTU to hunt down and capture or terminate that pesky Nikita.  Now we know Nikita is good, but she's no match for Jack Bauer!  In fact, the dude now heading Division was sent to take over CTU several years ago and saved Jack Bauer's life by flying a nuclear bomb into the desert where it detonated away from a populated area, so Jack owes him a favor, which could be repaid by catching Nikita.  However, that could cause more problems for Division as Bauer is now a fugitive from the U.S. government and being a rogue agent himself, may collaborate with Nikita in her endeavors.  Team Nikita-Bauer would then be unstoppable.  What takes Nikita months to accomplish, Jack Bauer could do in just 24 hours.  Maybe that may happen in season three ;-)
0316098515|5.0|Eleven Madison Park:The Cookbook is more than a cookbook although a dedicated home cook can certainly improve skills and learn new techniques from reading and using this book. Those lucky enough to eat at the Michelin starred restaurant in NYC know already that the food is spectacular with delightful surprises in each course. What the book provides is insight into the preparation of that food in the restaurant. There are diagrams of the kitchen stations and descriptions of the concepts. Maybe you think you want to be a restaurateur. This book is a valuable insight into what that means.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I took a chance on this cover despite some early unpopular reviews and I am glad I did. I wanted a lightweight cover to protect my Fire without adding much weight or girth. This thing is great, I don't know what they negative reviews are about. The hard cover is solid but lightweight. The portion that protects the screen is adequate and folds back nicely to remain out of the way while the Fire is being held. The stand feature works perfectly.<br /><br />Get this cover if you want something to protect your Fire, without adding much weight or size.

B00005JLO2|4.0|I've read the Amazon reviews, but frankly, this is a terrific action movie for now.  Harry is a coward; and against his nature, he recreates himself as a hero. How does he get there? Is it rational? Or baloney? This picture makes it on it's own terms. I loved the multi-ethnic emphasis. I spent a career that depended on the help and support of people who came from different backgrounds than I did. That is how life works today. As much as I loved the Zoltan Korda version, the hero was a cipher; the culture and point of view were defined by a dominant white culture that may have been well meaning but was, in retrospect, imperialist and exploitive. I don't think I ever saw him again in a lifetime of moviegoing. Heath Ledger is a protagonist of today; insecure,inarticulate of his own personal needs, uncertain of his own motivations; believing sincerely that he has lied to himself. Terrific performance and really sorry he's gone.  The denouement that distresses some of your critics is real. The people who help us through, whatever race or background, do so because it is the right thing to do.  This aspect of the film really knocked me out. As a lifetime urban person, I cannot tell you how many times people of different races or cultural backgrounds helped me through crises, both small and big.   Why do I only provide four stars for a movie I enjoyed so much?  Two reasons. First, the blindness scene: Ralph Richardson, one of the great theatre to film actors (minus Dr. Zhivago) provides the most poignant and unsettling moment in Korda's film (I've only seen this version and something bland called \\"Storm Over the Nile\\").  The scene where he realizes that Harry has saved him is, to me, the highlight and climax of the film. The other piece is that we do not see occurs when Harry allows himself to be branded on his forehead as a member of an outlaw tribe. The Richardson moment is one of the best in movie history when it comes to this genre of cinema. The brand is something thatno one in Manhattan would endure voluntarily.  I can live without the brand, but in a movie that arouses genuine feeling and support for the hero, the absence of the blindness revelation is a gross error. I'm sorry that the Richardson (one of the best screen actors from the stage) moment could not be included. Just for the moment when he realizes he was wrong. Otherwise, this is a better, more realistic and honest version of the way the world really works. This film is well worth your time.
B001UV4XJ2|3.0|We bought a copy of the blueray disc with ultraviolet copy from a local retail establishment. Not knowing what ultraviolet movies were, and expecting to get a real digital copy like always, we only discovered our error after getting the movie home. So, we went through all the rigmarole of creating our Flixter account and downloading the app to both our computer and our Ipod Touch. After we had done all that and entered the code for the movie, we discovered that for whatever reason, we were unable to download the digital movie to our device. Attempting to stream the movie to the device (which is not what we had really wanted) gave a similar error message. So far, we have been unable to resolve the issue. If you are looking for a real digital copy, this is NOT what you want to buy.

0060873027|1.0|This book doesn't do justice to Michael Crighton's writing.  I had to make myself finish it, skipping paragraphs and pages.  There was interesting information about the micro world of insects, but the rest of the book was just plain awful.
0783240287|5.0|It shipped pretty quickly, actually.  I LOVE Joseph, it's one of my favorite musicals, and I was excited to be able to watch again, since we'd lost our other copy.  It used to be something I watched a lot when I was sick, and I still enjoy it a lot.  The making-of documentary is pretty good, too, and has some pretty entertaining parts.
B006ANJ4BW|2.0|Ok, so they had a script lying around and decided that putting \\"Conan\\" on would sell the movie.  I get it.  It is ashamed because, while they are not great literature, R.E. Howard wrote some good stories that could have been good movies.  Instead we get generic stories with wooden acting.  Momoa = Schwarzenneger in terms of acting ability.  Movie was not very visually interesting. Nothing was particulalry \\"wow\\" worthy in the Hyborian world as presented. Music was good but not great.  Rent it cheap if you want to see it.
B004KAB3ZM|5.0|If you're a pilot, and want to know about not only how the space programme worked but also, what does it feels to be there, this is the book.   Michael Collins has a unique way of writting, and its gonna make you feel that you're really there flying with him; he's not so well known or recognized (like Armstrong or Aldrin) and so he can give you a little more perspective of how were they like, and what was like to be an astronaut on those times.  One of the best books i've read, i couldn't put it down nor for 1 second!
B00479SVBU|4.0|just received it in the mail....put music on an sd card, put the sd card in my soundfly, put it in cigarette lighter...works fine...It is better than carrying my ipod in and out of the house ...remember this is a 40.00 device so dont expect it to sound like a bose system....but it is worth the money

1419702238|5.0|Really fun almost comic book like, and it is great when you are to tired to read anything else, I would recommend this to any kids or even tweens because it is such a fun and easy read.
B000WS4PCO|5.0|One of the best CD's ever and needs to be in your collection! This CD is loaded with good songs were as most CD's you are lucky to get 4 or 5 good songs on the CD.
B000001FTD|4.0|Most thrash is the worst metal ever imo, it's half what melodic metal is in songwriting and playing. However anthrax has enough knowledge of real guitar playing to actually be very good. And even non thrash fans like me can really enjoy their 1980's output. There's only a few thrash bands that I think were talented enough to even do melodic metal and this is one of them. Metalica, megadeath and a few others also come to mind. But with this one anthrax started a run of great thrash metal cd's.  This is a powerful and fun cd. THe fun lasted until the early 90's with this band. By then they went totally hard and forgot the humor but here it's intact. These guys loved melodic metal so that influence keeps them from becoming what most thrash is today: limited one string boredom.<br />So this band and this cd joins my metal collection as one of the few thrash bands that I would ever have in my collection.  It's great at what it does.  rock on.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this looks fun, looking at the rest of the reviews though,its not looking the best. anyway, I hope its a good game and I'm not wasting my time...
B000002LUB|4.0|This is classic meldodic metal and the songs are very good here.  Dio was back for another round and the band plays it tight. This isn't as great as the classic heaven and hell but it's very good. I liked it very much indeed and I reject thrash as the best kind of metal.  Black sabbath was creating some great metal here that is based on songwriting. At the time I was hoping for a heaven and hell type of release but this one worked well enough.  \\"time machine' is a stand out on this one. BUt if you like melodic metal then this one is a good one to add to your collection.  rock on! dio is jamming on the other side, and you can bet that is the case.
B0067QPVJ6|4.0|I saw this movie before seeing John Carpenter's The Thing. It was a lot better after watching it again. I loved the creature effects and gore scenes. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is pretty much the only reason I wanted to see this because I enjoy her movies and she's very pretty. Some scenes dragged, and others were suspenseful. I love how it leads right into the original. In 1982, a paleontologist named Kate Lloyd is asked by a Norwegian scientist named Sander to travel to Antarctica to uncover a crashed extraterrestrial spaceship. They find a creature frozen in the ice, and bring it back to base. It soon thaws and becomes each member of the team and tries to escape. It's up to Kate to stop...THE THING!!!
0439023521|5.0|I spent all summer going in and out of Borders. Each time I passed up this book for what I thought were better reads. Boy was I wrong. I bought the book on my father's Kindle and instantly became hooked. I flew through and plan on rereading it. To me this book is a mixture of The Giver and The Uglies with a twist of violence and survival. The twists and turns caught me and pulled me in deeper into the book as I read. It took me three days of forcing myself to put it down at times to read it.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.

0440422973|5.0|Our book club decided to read this book for December since the holiday rush is affecting all of us and we wanted something that was both lighthearted and a fast read.  I couldn't have been more tickled with this selection.  John Grisham wrote a very funny story about a couple who just want to escape the Christmas hulabaloo for one year.  However, friends and family are appalled and confused at their decision and life becomes more difficult as Christmas nears.  I laughed out loud at points in this book - a delightful read for the holidays.
0783233477|3.0|This is by no means a bad film. The settings and photography are great, the acting, especially that of Anthony Hopkins, is decent and the story isn't bad; there are some nice touches of humor and a clever little twist just before the end.  The only trouble is that everything the movie has to say could be easily said in 100 minutes. Instead it drags on for three hours, with long periods where nothing much happens. This is really self-indulgence on the part of the director. I'm guessing he was aiming at 'art' instead of the nice little story it should have been.  It's better to watch on DVD than it was in the theater, because you can fast forward through the tedious bits. No doubt that is why it has been a bigger success as home entertainment than it was in release. Watch it, but keep that remote handy.
1451627289|5.0|A few months ago, I heard about this book. Realizing its' length convinced me to purchase a Kindle. I downloaded the book the day it was released.  In only 4 days, I had completed an amazing adventure.  As a longtime King fan, I thought \\"The Stand\\" was his masterpiece. Now, I'm not so sure.  Few books have made me as emotional as I became reading this book.  The ending is pure magic. With tears in my eyes, I realized the perfect story of Jake and Sadie was at an end. Only one problem for me now...finding a new book to read after this great story!!! Nothing will measure up!!
B001ED7C58|5.0|So stoked that I purchased this cd!  I am new to the whole Twilight saga phenomenon and have fallen in love with the books and the movies but I think this cd does stand on its own whether you are a seriously addicted fan like me or not.  It has opened my eyes to indie music and my neighbours probably think I only own one cd at the moment!  Highly recommend this soundtrack.
B005G4TJUC|4.0|Great value for money. I purchased this DVD for my son as he loves Transformers. Received the DVD before the estimated date and before it was due to be released in Australia.   We were only interested in the movie(extras etc not a big deal for my son) so it was a very good buy.Quality of movie was good too.
B005UKJX4E|2.0|This is like two unrelated films that have been mashed together - one is a collection of beautiful images of God's creation (a bit like Koyaanisqatsi but not as good), the other a family melodrama.  Brad Pitt is excellent - the family melodrama part has potential, it's like the early draft of a good film.  However, the whispered/muttered \\"profound\\" phrases that pervade the film are ridiculous - they reminded me of the uplifting cliches on those annoying inspirational posters - and the Sean Penn character should have been edited out.  (I love Sean Penn, but his character adds nothing to the film.)  The final scene is like a Monty Python skit - but the humor is (I assume) unintentional.  Overall, this film is way too long and ridiculously pretentious.  I like long, profound, artsy films as much as the next guy, but this film is like a parody of the genre.  I stayed through the whole thing hoping it would get better, but it got worse.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Totally worth reading. I read at night and found myself thinking about the book during the day, because I could not wait to get back to it.
B000I0QK74|2.0|As a long time fan of JT, I was expecting something closer to his style of music.  Rather, this collection is JT reaching for a jazzy/bluesy feeling and really, if you want that in a Christmas album, JT wouldn't be your first choice.  The lesson I learned is to listen to all the samples and don't assume that any holiday album will sound like previous work.

B005HP2JAM|5.0|I was awe struck at the 30,000 year old art and somehow felt very humbling trying to grasp what this means to us as humanity  Hats off to the explorers who brought this into light and for using 3D (although crude at time, is very effective)...this has to be seen in 3D to truly appreciate the feeling of being there.
B00133KFGW|5.0|In order to appreciate this movie, you must watch with your heart.  This will banish the implausibility which doesn't matter if you can catch the essence of the film.  Beautiful story, beautiful movie, beautiful premise.  One of my all time favorites.

0801896940|3.0|This book addresses an important gap in the landscape of textbooks on theoretical mechanics.  I strongly feel this is the way the subject should be approached as Noether's theorem has such far reaching implications beyond just classical mechanics.  Yet, there are annoying glitches.  E.g. the oversight on p.28 with regards to the fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations as has been pointed out in a previous review.  On page 99 the equation (6.3.1) for the Hamiltonian density is incorrect.  The way it is written the first term sums over all coordinate indexes.  Correct would be to only have time i.e. index zero appear in the first term and sum over all field components if we deal with more than a simple scalar field.  Other times the authors just presents an equation without a modicum of information of how we got there.  I.e. the alternative form of the Rund-Trautman identity (RTI II) is given on p.68.  It's easy enough to see how the right side follows from RTI I when substituting the canonical variables and using the product rule, but how does the left side of RTI II come about? How does the Euler-Lagrange identity reappear there? (I attached a comment to this review if you are looking for the answer).  Still, I enjoy the book but I would have liked to like it even better.

0525423281|4.0|I LOVED Anna and the unique voice that Stephanie writes so I was really excited for LOLA. I was not disappointed. While I felt more of a connection to Anna because I was overseas for school while reading it and I was more like Anna, I still loved Lola. I understood her plight and I loved her quirks. I also adored Cricket. Like, A LOT. He was the perfect mix of Nerdy and sweet. and he has nerdy chic down (something my own nerdy bf does not have, alas). I also really liked Max and I felt a bit disappointed when the author chose to make him a bit mean and out of character at the end. He seemed really sweet in the beginning and Lola was the one who continued to lie to him. Why can't a boy be great but just not the one? Why was it necessary to make him not nice?   I really liked Cricket's adoration of Lola and the tension that comes from him wanting horribly to make a move on her but unable to because of her relationship with Max. He really is the perfect guy and I felt for him.   The characters are all well-developed, the romance is wonderful, and the voice is perfect. A really enjoyable contemporary romance from an author who has a unique writing style and wonderful grasp of teenagers who aren't cookie cutter perfect.
B002C39TTQ|2.0|VINYL BUYERS BEWARE!! The vinyl version DOES NOT include \\"How Soon is Now?\\" and is actually the original UK version of the vinyl. I hate to say that I specifically purchased an album for one song, but I am guilty of that, and was really looking forward to jamming this particular song with my friends. Unfortunately the vinyl is missing this single, even though the product description says U.S. version!  So, if you are looking for \\"How Soon is Now?\\" on vinyl, try to locate the U.S. version, not the UK.   Otherwise the rest of this album is pretty mediocre, sonics aren't that great and it doesn't really make me want to get up and jump around like most albums should.   Oh well... what's $28? (That was sarcasm).

B000001GPX|5.0|Right from the opening bars of the first movement you know that this is something special. The first four ominous notes which ring in the first movement of the 5th symphony are read by Kleiber (and played by the Vienna philharmonic) with such attack, force, precision and at a better than brisk tempo that you know for sure within the first few minutes of listening to this CD that history is made on this recording. I scoured through my entire collection, comparing each version against the other across Beethoven cycles I have and I have not been able to find the bite, venom and the dramatis of the Kleiber reading in any of the other versions of the 5th I have. Also the 7th symphony's playfulness, cheerfulness, and exuberance is brought to the fore by Kleiber's precision and speed. Brilliant stuff. This a sure fire must-have on your CD shelf if you are a Beethoven fan (who isn't?)  After rummaging through my 7 cycles of Beethoven symphonies (Solti, Karajan, Cluytens, Szell, Bohm, Haitink, Muti) & Non full cycle compilations (Furtwangler, Giulini, Kleiber), I felt comfortable putting down the below as my top choices for the 5th that I keep returning to. Each of the below share the number one spot for me. I cannot pick a winner between them, they are all winners.  Bruno Walter/Columbia Symphony Orchestra/Sony  George Szell/Cleveland Orchestra/1963/Sony  Haitink/London Symphony Orchestra/2006  Kleiber/Vienna Philharmonic/1975-DG  Karl Bohm/Vienna Philharmonic/1975-DG
B000I2J2X6|1.0|I thought I was getting an excellent price on this DVD and as soon as me and my daughter finished the book we couldn't wait to watch the movie.  When I put the DVD in it did not work. When I took it out and looked at it, it was a blank DVD with nothing on it. Very dissapointing.  Amazon refunded my money and then I bought the DVD through Amazon for about $4 more dollars and there wasn't any problem. BEWARE  of this!!!

B0055IU4GM|4.0|John Hiatt is one of the great musical story-tellers of our day.  Just like the colorless, sepia toned photo on the front cover suggests, his latest offering is a somewhat dark mix of country and blues.  Gone are the up-beat rockers of his past but, don't get me wrong, this album has some electric numbers on it, but the best songs are mostly acoustic guitars, soft drums, some string arrangements, with a little pedal steel guitar thrown in.<br /><br />The first track, Damn This Town, does kick things off with a bang.  It is one of the most electric/loudest songs on the album.  A song about a man growing up and living in a dead-end town and how it negatively affected his entire family.<br /><br />The second track, Til I Get My Loving Back, features some nice pedal steel guitar.  Almost a little \\"too country\\" for my personal tastes, it still is John Hiatt, so I keep an open mind and keep on listening.<br />The next two tracks, I Love That Girl, and All the Way Under are pretty much what I would call \\"standard Hiatt songs\\" with I Love That Girl being a little more \\"popish\\" than most of the material here, but a nice song over-all.<br /><br />This album really hits its stride about mid-way thru, beginning with Don't Wanna Leave You Now, a nice Hiatt standard, mid-tempo song with his usual spoken word delivery and a calming string arrangement in the background.  Moving into Detroit Made, a fun story of a boy and his car and how it influenced his life.<br /><br />Once we get to Hold On For Your Love, we are in the midst of a long and eerie blues number (6+ min) that I think is the best song on here, thru to Down Around My Place, an even slower, blusier, darker song with haunting vocals towards the end.  These two songs make up a couple of the best tracks on the album.<br /><br />Adios to California brings back a more upbeat tempo and the pedal steel sound from earlier in the disc, plus more of Hiatt's smooth and effortless vocal delivery.  John ends the album with a song about 9/11 called When New York Had Her Heart Broke.  It sounds like he was there that day and it's just taken him 10 years to write something about it, because he really didn't know what to say.<br /><br />Note: I do consider myself a fan of Hiatt's music, but I do not automatically love everything he creates.  This album I would recommend to anyone who I thought would like this type of Roots/Blues Rock, hence the 4-star rating.  I think it's better than most of his albums.It sounds like he was there that day and it's just taken him 10 years to write something about it, because he really didn't know what to say.

068981528X|5.0|A fine example of rich irony and wonderfully done absurdity... Both text and pictures are vivid & outrageously funny. If you appreciate the humor of \\"the Princess Bride\\" (my kids' favorite movie) this will be up your alley. What dad (or older brother) could resist reading a kids' book that actually includes the word \\"plexiglas\\" ?  The moral of the story is... some books are for sheer laugh-out-loud pleasure. This is one of them.

B003JVH7XU|5.0|If you are a Scott Adkins fan, or love martial arts action movies with great choreography, you will enjoy this movie. I have watched it 5 or 6 times since purchasing it and I have a feeling it's going to be in many ways this generation's \\"Bloodsport\\". Adkins is one of the most talented martial artists I have seen on film, and I think this movie is one of his best works to date. If you are looking for romantic comedy, Oscar winning acting, drama, or any of that stuff, you're obviously in for a disappointment but if you like a lot of action and don't mind some violence and language (I wait for the kiddos to go to bed before watching) you should appreciate the skill and talent that went into this movie.

It also includes sketches, studies, roughs... besides the great writing around it, which explaining everything else. I give it 5 out 5 stars because it is priceless!
B005TZFZJC|4.0|Rihanna is my favorite younger artist out there.  I love all of her albums.  This is the first one that I found was just a notch down from her previous efforts.  It gets off to a weak start and really doesn't start kicking in until about Track 3.  It's a roller coaster work out ride from that point on, but not without it's weak fillers here and there.
B006FTCH2E|4.0|This movie is very well done. No 3-D aliens and nothing exploded. Very thoughtful dialog and great use of the Science Fiction genre to tell a very human story. William Mapother (probably best known as \\"Ethan\\" in the seies \\"Lost\\") and Brit Marling (who has an economics degree from Georgetown an looks very comfortable playing the \\"smart girl\\" role)are very good. Kids will find this boring as will people that need helicopters in every other scene to keep their attention.  But if you want to view deep characters in an interesting story, this is a jackpot. I gave this 4 stars but I'd call it a 4+.
B001CD6FKI|5.0|The movie played well with no issues even though the DVD itself had very minor surface marks.  Aside from the small scratches that did not affect playback, the DVD was clean and in an unbroken, original case.  Movie came before the estimated ship date, so I'm very happy about that.  Would purchase from this seller again.
0553807919|4.0|I got this book when a neighbor and fellow mom recommended it. Glad she did! I already knew about basic child development, and even a solid amount (for a non-scientist) about emotions and the brain. But the authors have put these together in a way that I found very helpful. While they present specific strategies (good), the better aspect is that through these strategies, they're helping you shift they way you understand and respond to the bigger, broader challenges of parenting (great!). I've been recommending it to other parents (including my husband, who also really liked it).
0375758992|3.0|The writing is interesting with vivid descriptions of life in Africa as seen by a child growing up there. But the subject matter is distressing and depressing -- about a family dysfunctional to the point of almost being criminal. I mean seriously, letting an 8-year old handle an Uzi? Smoke cigarettes? Drink beer? I'm pretty sure I'd not have finished reading this book if it weren't required reading for this month's selection of our book club.
0307593312|3.0|For quite some time I had been wanting to try my first sampling of the works of popular Japanese author Haruki Murakami, so when I heard about the U.S. publication of his greatest work (in length and, presumably, scope), \\"1Q84\\", I bought a copy on the day of the first release and started reading.  Given this and the facts that I have traveled to Japan and have an appreciation for Japanese culture, cuisine and technology, one could say I was biased towards wanting to enjoy 1Q84.  Alas, although I enjoyed aspects of the book, it did not fully live up to what I realize, in retrospect, were lofty expectations.  For the longest time while reading 1Q84 I was not sure what the book is.  With a title like \\"1Q84\\" and the occasional mention in the text of bits from George Orwell's classic book, one might expect upon opening the book for the first time that 1Q84 would be a political treatise.  A violent act at the beginning of the book, coupled with some subsequent events, had me thinking the book might be a thriller set in Tokyo.  Murakami presents an alternative world that contains some fantastical beings and worshippers, leading me to think he might be trying to present an new religious belief and value system.  Or maybe, since the chapters of the book start off by alternating between the two lead characters, one male and one female, Murakami has penned a love story.  Eventually it becomes clear what 1Q84 is, when certain things get fully explored and resolved whereas other plot elements do not.  But even when it is finally clear what type of book 1Q84 is, that only tells you what the book is on the surface.  Ultimately 1Q84 is a story about alienation in the modern world, which happens to be the Tokyo of 1984 - but it could easily be the New York City of 2011.  All the main characters are loners with varying degrees of suffering in their backgrounds.  Their interactions vary from the mundane to events which apparently violate the laws of physics.  Moral principles get turned upside down as the characters struggle to determine what is the right thing to do (by the way, 1Q84 is not a book for young adults, as there are several scenes and scenarios that would cause U.S. school boards to keep the book off lists of recommended summer reading for high schoolers).  If I had to summarize what Murakami is saying, it is that we live in a frighteningly complex world in which it is impossible to know how and why everything is happening, and the best that we can hope for is to find a refuge from the craziness.  Sometimes, that refuge takes the form of dying, but there are other solutions, too.  1Q84 did hold my interest throughout, although as one might expect the first third of the book was a bit slower paced than the remainder.  The writing, as translated into English, was fairly straightforward and easy to follow.  One minor surprise was the large number of references to Western popular and classical culture; I was expecting more references to Japanese culture.  The very first scene takes place on the elevated Tokyo highway that ran next to the hotel I stayed at during my last visit to Tokyo, which was amusing to me: I did recognize some elements of Tokyo throughout the book.  And I was a bit sad to see 1Q84 come to an end.  But when an author pens a 900+ page volume (which I consider to be epic length), then my expectation is that the book measure up to epic standards.  Alas, 1Q84 does not, in my opinion.

1400032717|4.0|Autism is a condition that many people around the world face, but no one can quite grasp the hardships that are faced until you see through the eyes of one yourself. Luckily, Mark Haddon has produced a mind-boggling book that helps to see through the eyes of a fifteen year old Autistic boy.  The Autistic boy that is being referred to is Christopher. Christopher is fifteen years, two months, and three days old and has a rat named Toby. He has an impeccable ability to remember every capital of every country in the world and diagram nearly any situation. The only things Christopher does not understand is emotions,the quick disappearance of his mother, and the murder of an innocent dog.  In the beginning, most people would expect the book to be about the murder of Wellington. Wellington being the black poodle who used to live next door until he was found dead on Mrs. Shears' front lawn, stabbed to death with a garden fork. However, as the investigation transpired, Christopher was left for dead when he found some riveting news about Mr. and Mrs. Shears, his mother, father and Wellington. Due to this bewildering information, Christopher now had a new and more complex mystery/ adventure set out in front of him.   Throughout both of the mysteries, Christopher's Autism was one of his most prevalent issues. Struggling most with being touched and deciphering emotions made getting out of the house and looking for the answers one of the most difficult things for him. Although, with his diagramming and specific notice of the little things around him, Christopher was able to take you to the answers of his mysteries and his very own happily ever after.  Mark Haddon's simplistic book helps guide the naive world to see what Autism is truly like and will leave all readers of this book with a new inspiration to be your bravest regardless of the circumstances.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|This has got to be the best thing it was created for video game console and its flexibility and portability. Not only it gives you a stylish and robust way to carry your console and accessories, but the quality of built in devices is awesome. Video with 1080p, or automatic resolution detection, with screen options to adjust color, brightness, contrast, and even saturation, among many other options for sound and menu settings. Quality of sound is very good, which can be adjusted via screen menu. Built-in connectors for HDMI (small cable supplied by seller, 2 connectors for headphones which can be used for a two player game, and a connector for the screen power cord. Beying that I am a military individual and constantly being deployed, this case is of great use and practicability, where you are not dependent on a tv to play your system. Oh, and did I mention it comes with a padding which can be used for XBOX on one side and if flipped it can be used for PS3??? It also has two strapps which secure the console to place, and two great pouches for controls and cable storage. one word: awesomeness. With an external 2 TB hard-drive, I give my console more use than I do my laptop.  The only down side is that when open it does not have a locking system to hold the screen open unless you have it on top of a sturdy surface like a table.  As for the seller, I am unable to comment on any type of tech support, since I just purchased it and have not had any need for it. Shipping and handling was as expected and well packaged, with a great turn around time of 5 business days to an APO/FPO mailing address.
B006FE17Q6|5.0|I've never read the graphic novels, but this TV show has me hooked!  Season one set up a terrifying world, with more gore and action than season two, but the first set of episodes of season two contain a relative calm that contrasts well with the violence that the group has been faced with daily since the zombie \\"epidemic\\" began.  The show may be in a lull in terms of action/fighting/slaughter, but it maintains the fear within this lull through the scene at the school and the occasional walker, and is improving character development and the growing friction between members of the group when they are not fighting for their lives all the time.  Although Herschel's place appears to be a safe haven, the world outside is extremely dangerous and this security can't last while so many walkers are still out there.  This backdrop is maintained through the differing opinons of Shane and Rick, and the whole idea of a new baby coming into a world so devastated with horror.    Since a big theme in season two so far is whether to stay or go, the \\"security\\" of Herschel's farm is a good contrast to the constant danger in the city.  I am frustrated, however, that no one in the group has discussed with Herschel and his family the findings of the scientist at the research center.  As a veteranarian, Herschel ought to understand that if all of the brain is dead aside from activity in the brain stem, that he is not getting his wife and step-son back as people.  The personality, the emotions, speech and memory centers--the stuff that makes a person human is dead and decaying.  I find it interesting that he considers zombification an illness, but it's a brain destroying illness, and it gives pause to think about it compared to other brain illnesses.  For example, if a person in a non-zombie controlled world was to get a very bad brain illness in which their whole brain would decay away except for their lower brain and brain stem, would they want to live this way?  I would guess that manypeople would say, \\"Pull the plug,\\" especially knowing that they would also become bloodthirsty killers and try to eat their loved ones if they didn't.  If Herschel was informed about the scientific experiments that were done before the CFC shut down,  might think differently, being a scientist himself.  However, the way they have done the plot allows Herschel to firmly add a new way of thinking about the zombies, and I enjoy the new depth this brings to the whole idea.  I am intrigued by what the added characterization is bringing out in the group.  I think Rick, Lori, Glenn, Carl, Carol, Andrea and T-Dog are building on the previous characterization from series 1 and so far don't see much change from them.  However, Daryl, Shane, Dale, and Herschel are being explored and changing very much in the first section of season 2.    DARYL:  Daryl is definitely getting more likable, caring, and showing innate intelligence that was not always clear before and distinguishes him from his brother significantly.  It was interesting how Daryl kept himself going while injured with hallucinations of abuse and taunting.  It made me wonder how much he really misses his brother and family, and whether he could use the end of his previous life with that abuse to make himself a better person.  His knowledge of the Cherokee Rose, his kindness to Carol, and the fact that he twice saved T-Dog's life, despite being raised racist and T-Dog being responsible for his brother's death, is an important signal that there is more to him than the the hick tough guy he showed at first.  He almost dies finding a doll.  He brings Carol out to the rose and explains it to her.  He actually apologizes for calling Carol a bitch.  This man is now able to explore parts of himself that had been forced inside in his old life.  SHANE: I feel that Shane is getting a raw deal in his characterization overall in season 2 so far.  He is portrayed as becoming more and more out of control, murderous, and selfish andthere is overshadowing that he may kill Rick to get Lori back.  I don't think this is fair as he obviously cares a lot for Rick, Lori, and Carl.  Think of his support of Rick when Carl was shot and Rick was in shock, particularly the scene in which he holds Rick's face to his and talks sense into him about keeping it together for his boy.  This scene between the two men is extremely moving and appears to be legitimate emotion on Shane's part.  Carl looks up to Shane, and although Lori is in denial of it, he is a great father figure to Carl, especially when Rick seems too busy leading to spend much time with his son, and was a big support to Lori in the beginning.  It takes two to have an affair, and I think Lori is being unfair having so much anger towards Shane when she does owe her life to him and as far as I can tell from the scenes at the hospital, I believe that Shane thought Rick had no chance.  Shane risked his own safety when tried to help barricade Rick's room as best he could before he had to leave to save himself and Rick's family.  I think the anger Shane shows is expected when Lori goes from loving him to hating him, and I will be disappointed if Shane becomes the \\"bad guy\\" in the show, suggested by the fact that he shot Otis, his dark secret that Dale throws at him telling him he is a dangerous man.  However, logically, he wouldn't have made it back alive with the necessary supplies to save Carl's life if he hadn't shot Otis, and he is trained as a cop to know what to do in situations like this.  Also, half of the group seemed to want to kill Otis for shooting Carl in the first place.  I don't think Shane is perfect--he flies off the handle too much and is on the offensive pretty much all the time.  However, he has done a lot of good for the group, leading them to safety in the first place, and has to control tons of emotion and joy lost and gained when Rick came back.  He is a trained policeman, used to using firearms as a way to resolve conflict, andis bound to have mixed emotions with all that has happened between him, Lori, Carl, and Rick.  To Lori, he has gone from appreciated hero to deceptive creep, and this is all due to the return of his best friend, whom he would have done anything for, but through his relationship with Lori, he will never again have the same kind of friendship with Rick and has in a way, lost him again.  I was touched by the look of joy on his face when he learned about Lori's pregnancy and his care for Carl is extremely obvious and not creepy at all.  I hope they are not going to turn Shane evil on us.  DALE:  Dale is showing more of his fatherly instinct to Andrea, although she is not appreciative of it and that seems to hurt him more than it should.  He always seems strong and kind, almost to the point of irritation, but it is getting over the top now now, verging towards becoming a weakness.  What do we know about him besides that he is a \\"nice guy\\" and he lost his family?  People turn to him for help with their problems, and he seems to think about things slowly and in a larger context than the present.  I like him and agree with his peaceful ideas in general, but I also think he is becoming more fragile this season.  He shouldn't have taken the guns and tried to bury them in swampland--whether he believes in them or not, the guns are an essential way to take down walkers from far away and half of the group risked their lives going back to the city to retrieve them.  Herschel is on the fence about letting them stay anyway; getting rid of the guns is a rash idea that seems to stem from his protective feelings for Andrea and not wanting her spending more time than necessary with Shane.  This goes against my perception of Dale from season 1--season 1 Dale would have discussed the guns more with the group--why is he trying to make decisions on his own, based seemingly on Andrea and her rejection of him as a parental figure and friend?  He is making rash decision based on emotions inthe same way that he criticizes Shane for doing.  When he went to the woods, I didn't realize he had the guns but thought he was going to take his own life.  Dale is confusing, and changing from what he was, and I liked what he was.  HERSCHEL:  I already discussed my interest in Herschel's way of viewing zombification as an illness that could have a cure.  I thought he had a solid, respectable character until the last episode before the break (aka, when they find Sophia).  He appears to be a smart man; a man who saves lives and cares about people he knows whether or not they have become zombies.  I try not to apply frightening television to my own life, but I think I would be with Herschel on keeping my family alive as zombies.  It goes along with his apparently caring personality.  What doesn't make sense is that he is so opposed to the group staying on, aside from the fact that they could draw more zombies, however, episode 7 brings out a major secret as far as Herschel.  The discussion with his daughter hints at a perhaps less than kind Herschel in the past, but the main slap is Sophia.  Here are a group of people, risking everything daily to try to find her, and all along she is in the barn.  As it is Herschel and his grandson (I think) who seem to be the people who put the walkers into the barn, I just don't believe that he didn't think of saying, \\"Wait, we picked up a little girl of that description in the past few days.  She's a walker now and in our barn.\\"  What does that say about him?  I know he doesn't want to have more people on his farm and wants to try to ride out the \\"plague\\" with his family close and safe and hopefully find a cure.  But to allow the group to risk their lives and  Carol to continue her hope when he has very recently put Sofia in with the zombies in the barn, show that there is a side to Herschel that is completely different.  I am waiting to see what happens after the break and who in the farm family knew about Sofia.  Overall, season2 is keeping my attention as much as, if not more than season 1.  If you have missed it, you can purchase both season 1 and season 2, so far, and I would recommend it.  This show has something for the action-lover and for the emotional watcher, while also showing solid characterization and great acting.  Each episode unravels more of the plot and characters, and there has not been an episode this season so far that I have come away from thinking just, \\"that was okay,\\" because each episode has something in it that is thought provoking and hooks you, waiting for the next installment!  Watch it--it's worth your time.

1439110123|3.0|There was a political story to Big Oil that was peculiarly absent from Mr. Yergin's encyclopedic account in \\"The Prize\\".  From the epilogue:  \\"In America, throughout the 20th century, the companies have been the object of intense scrutiny, suspicion, and mistrust.\\"  Here is a pivotal point and Mr. Yergin's last chance to address the roots of pervasive and historical public mistrust of Big Oil.  But in the next sentence, Mr. Yergin fails for the last time by quoting Robert O. Anderson, the former Chairman of Arco instead:  \\"We can't be low profile.\\"  Mr. Yergin then finishes the paragraph with, \\"And that fact alone will continue to bridle the power of the giants of the industry.\\" - The fact that they can't operate stealthily is at the heart of the issue, all else be damned??  Mr. Yergin cites numerous references to challenges faced by Big and Independent Oil companies, such as:  Continuous U.S. Justice Department crackdown on monopolistic practices of Big Oil, wild fluctuations in oil prices and the ensuing price risk for both producers and consumers, costly drilling of empty holes.  All of these give the impression of his tendency to sympathize with the plight of the 7 Sisters (petroleum supermajors) throughout.  Whether this bias is intentional or not is irrelevant.  It is rather curious that an 800 page book on the history of oil wins a Pulitzer prize in 1992 with only a cursory coverage of the political influences of the multinational oil corporations.  This is a story that is very well researched and written, yet deficient of one of its key components perhaps owing partially to the author's ties to the industry.

Science has its own magic: the magic of REALITY.\\"<br /><br />The above extract comes at the very end of this extraordinary book by Richard Dawkins with illustrations by Dave McKean.  Dawkins is a British ethologist (the scientific study of animal behaviour), evolutionary biologist and author.  He is emeritus fellow of New College, a constituent college of the University of Oxford in the UK and was this university's Professor for the Public Understanding of Science from 1995 to 2008.  McKean has illustrated and designed many award-winning books and graphic novels.<br /><br />The chapters of this book are titled by a question like \\"What is the sun?\\" or \\"Why are there so many different kinds of animals?\\"  Most chapters usually begin with some mythical answers to a chapter title question.  (Amazingly, many people today believe these mythical answers.)  Then a scientific or reality-based answer to the question is provided.<br /><br />Who can read this book?  Anyone aged 120 to 12 (including those adults who still think like children).  For those with a solid science background, this book can be regarded as a good review of important concepts.<br /><br />The myths chosen for this book are from around the world such as Babylonian, Judeo-Christian, Aztec, Maori, Aboriginal, Nordic, Hellenic, Chinese, and Japanese.  One chapter includes modern alien abduction mythology and another chapter omits mythology altogether (there is a reason for this omission and Dawkins explains why).<br /><br />Dawkins details these topics (even though he doesn't use many of these terms):<br /><br />(1) evolution<br />(2) speciation (evolutionary process by which new biological species arise)<br />(3) atomic theory (concerned with the nature of matter)<br />(4) optics<br />(5) planetary motion<br />(6) gravitation (or gravity)<br />(7) stellar evolution (or star evolution)<br />(8) spectroscopy (study of the interaction between matter and radiation such as visible light)<br />(9) plate tectonics (describes the large scale motion of Earth's outermost rocky layer)<br />(10) speculation on exobiology (life beyond Earth)<br />(11) Chaos theory (\\"Why do bad things happen?\\")<br />(12) Human psychology (\\"What is a miracle?\\")<br /><br />All the science in this book is well-presented.  It has to be since it has to appeal to a wide age-range of people (as indicated above).<br /><br />Finally, all the illustrations in this book are in a word--fantastic.  They add to its enjoyment.<br /><br />In conclusion, this book is truly a myth-believers nightmare.  Make no myth-stake about it, this is a good book.  I leave you with a key concept from this book:<br /><br />\\"Next to the true beauty and magic of the real world, supernatural spells and stage tricks seem cheap and tawdry by comparison.  The magic of reality is neither supernatural nor a trick, but--quite simply--wonderful.  Wonderful and real.

0553801473|1.0|I persevered with this book and have finally finished reading it.  I found it convoluted and boring beyond my previous experience of any fantasy writer.  The whole series is written in a way that is quite easy to put down, because you develop empathy for a character in one chapter only to find the next chapter is about an entirely different (and often quite mundane) character.  For someone who has a busy life and reads to relax, this can be a blessing, the book doesn't eat into your life and you can put it down frequently (which I did - especially in the last two books of the series).  Right now I have a sense that GRRM lost the plot and I'm not particularly interested in seeing if he ever finds it again.

0312243022|4.0|The Hours is a story about three women in three different eras who are each struggling to find meaning for their lives: Clarissa lives in present day New York and is planning a party for her oldest friend, Laura lives in the 1950s, is pregnant, and is supposed to be preparing dinner for her husband's birthday, but she can't put down her copy of \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\", and Virginia Woolf is thinking what Clarissa Dalloway will do as she creates the 1925 book.<br /><br />I've never read \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\", but didn't find that to hinder my enjoyment of this book as Michael Cunningham weaves their stories together, showing that each generation struggles in much the same way - to find a reason to live.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|A classic movie that is worth every penny!  The scenery are enhanced beautifully on the Blu-Ray, not to mention the sound quality.  The commentaries are very enlightening.  I LOVE this movie and never gets tired of it.  Will watch over and over and over again.
0192503898|4.0|I've seen this in too many productions to be able to read without any preconceived impressions. This was Austen's first published work, not her best, but definitely in keeping with the themes of her later books. For Jane Austen, a lifetime of happiness is reached with a blend of equal parts sense and sensibility, pride and prejudice, and a little bit of persuasion thrown in for good measure.
B005UA0FLE|5.0|I am a long-time Michael Michael Bubl&eacute; fan, and really looked forward to this album when I first heard about it.  I really enjoyed his earlier 6-track Christmas album, \\"Let it Snow\\", and was expecting more of the same here.  \\"Christmas\\" definitely comes in as a set of classic Christmas songs, sung in the unique voice that is Michael Bubl&eacute;.  Some of the tracks offer a bit of uniqueness to them, \\"Santa Baby\\" being the greatest example, with a masculine wish-list (not my favorite song on the album though).  However, most of the songs are fairly traditional, and none offer the big band feel you get in other albums of this genre.  That said, the album does grow and grow on the listener...who is bound to enjoy it.  I know I do, and will keep it on my playlist through the Christmas season.  Highly recommended!
193413712X|5.0|Although this won the Pulitzer in 2010, I haven't heard much else about it, which surprises me. This is a beautiful piece! The writing reminds me of Marilynne Robinson's, which means I loved it, of course.<br /><br />George Crosby was a \\"tinker\\", a peddler and a clock repairman and time is a theme the author weaves into the story well. As the author counts down the hours of George's life, he tinkers with our sense of timing, jumping, often without warning, from George's childhood to his adult life. I had the feeling I was listening to an old man tell me the story of his life and had to pay close attention they way you do with elderly dementia patients.<br /><br />The writing was beautiful. Definitely one I'll pick up to re-read at some point
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have been a King fan as long as I can remember, but definitely have a preference for his works prior to 2000. The Green Mile was the last story I *really* got into, and I had been excited about 11/22/63 for months.<br /><br />11/22/63 appeals to conspiracy theorists, science-fiction/time travel fans, and history buffs alike. King does an excellent job of portraying 1958-1962 American society, without placing too much judgment on the people and circumstances of the time.<br /><br />Jake/George is a character everyone can fall in love, and Sadie, Deke, Al, and others are so well-developed that you feel like they are your friends, too.<br /><br />800+ pages, but worth every word. It could have been 200 pages longer, and still a phenomenal read.<br /><br />I want more historical fiction/time travel stories from Stephen King.

B004EPZ0AC|1.0|In my family we LOVE Mumble. We have watched Happy Feet more than 50 times. The movie has a strong environmental message but is positive and loving and very funny. You really care for the penguins and hope everything will end well and laugh all through the movie with Ramon and the \\"Amigos\\". It makes you go out and love the world we live in, and want to take care of it.  Happy Feet 2 is another issue. I spent the whole movie wishing it would end soon. I got this terrible feeling that the world is going to end tomorrow. I understand how important it is for kids to be conscious about what is going on in the world. After all, they are our future and need to take care of our planet. But seeing the ice melting in such a terrifying way, seeing grass growing everywhere around their friends Mumble and Gloria, seeing thousands of penguins about to die... was not something my kids needed to see.  My oldest (6) was very stressed during the movie, telling me he didn't want to see the ice melting and asking continuously if the movie would end well.  Not at all funny and with much less dancing and singing than the first one, this is actually a thriller kids don't need to watch.  We didn't even enjoy the singing since Gloria's voice is nothing like it used to be and Eric's singing is so tremendously squeaky.  Where are their parents, anyway? Did they just disappear?  Could have done without it, would have felt much happier all evening.
1416562605|5.0|Hysterically funny read, and a well crafted story, too. I listened to it on CD in the car and couldn't WAIT to get back to driving.<br /><br />The White Tiger is a letter written to the Prime Minister of Japan (?) on the eve of his visit dictated by the protagonist, Balram. He introduces the Prime Minister to Indian ways with the story of his rags-to-riches life, then offers to be his driver.<br /><br />The story is a darkly comical statement about the Indian economy, culture, and religious differences. A worthy read by a great new author.
B000H4QD1O|5.0|I had never heard of this show until I stumbled across it on Amazon Instant Video-Prime.  I was so riveted I watched every single episode.  I am stunned this show only lasted one season-a real shame.  There is an amazing bond between all the characters that makes this show believable and irresistible; you just want to watch and learn more about them and their relationships.  The basic plot of this futuristic show is that humans have moved to a new solar system after burning out the earth.  It starts when the Alliance has defeated the independents and taken control of the solar system under one rule/law.  The captain of the ship Firefly was an independent fighter and sought refuge and a form of freedom in a smuggling ship he bought.  Each character is likable and endearing despite their faults and I can't stress how well they all work together-a rare and unique chemistry.  In a few of the episodes the writing is not awesome but the acting and characters still make it worth watching.
0375703861|3.0|This story is told in four parts about immigration, religion, race, sex, war, politics, and history. It's huge in scope, but I'm not sure the author pulls it off entirely. Parts of this book I found to be very interesting; the way Smith describes her characters, for instance, was impressive. Her characters are distinctive, but her story line - while massive - left me flat most of the time.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|While you definitely don't have to watch the TV series first, in my opinion, it adds to the experience.  The first five plus minutes are jammed packed with information summarizing the back story.  Although I hate that the series ended after one season, I am glad we get another glimpse into this rich world and lovable characters.  The freedom loving smugglers on the firefly ship Serenity finally find out why the Alliance is hunting the mentally troubled and experimented on River (a passenger on their ship).  She knows a secret that could weaken if not bring down the Alliance which has a firm hold on the central planets.  The crew has to decide what to do with River-push her and her brother off or fight to reveal the secret.  The chemistry between the crew clicks back into gear and all of the great characters make an appearance.  There is a lot of action and it is a great story.  I think Joss Whedon did some of his best work on this movie.  My only regret is that it had to end.  Hope this helps!
B00004W50T|5.0|The Band/ Music from Big Pink (Bonus tracks edition): \\"Big Pink\\" was The Band taking songs they had written with Bob Dylan at the Big Pink House in New York State and, recording the songs properly, they released this ground breaking Country Rock album.  With this album, The Band became much more than just the one that Dylan loved to record and tour with; they became a true legend in their own right.  The original Big Pink was worthy of five stars by itself but with this bonus tracks edition you practically get double the album with all these wonderful Basement Tape additions.  Highly Recommended.
0756404738|5.0|As a prolific reader I have been saying, and genuinely believe, that The Wise Man's Fear by Patrick Rothfuss is \\"the best book ever.\\" The Wise Man's Fear is the sequel to The Name of the Wind (which is a necessary warm up) in the Kingkiller Chronicles trilogy. As you begin reading, you will find Rothfuss is an articulate and amazing story weaver. He creates an elaborate, widely creative fantasy world as detailed in the spirit of Tolkien. This is a book that will have you wrapped up, calling out of work to stay home and read. The author writes an accessible, engaging and fascinating story that follows the main character, Kvothe, through danger-filled escapades. Wise Man's Fear is a combination of adventure, fantasy, tragedy and romance set in a world so tangibly close to our own. I highly recommend this book for anyone looking for a little magic and intrigue.
B00005NKKY|5.0|Simon and Garfunkel/ Bookends (bonus tracks edition):  Although this cannot be confused with a `rock opera', there certainly is a concept that drives this album:  That concept being personal Relationships, all kinds of personal relationships (even imaginary relationships).  There is not a bad track on it, and the impact of the album is often very emotional, and very personal.  This is a five-star album.  Highly recommended.

B0012GMW3Y|4.0|The Byrds/ Wanted-The Notorious Byrd Brothers:  I like this album but it is a mix of different styles and it does not feel like an album, more like an odds and sods kind of release.  However, with \\"Goin' Back\\", \\"Wasn't born to follow\\" and \\"Old John Robertson\\" among the songs, It is an album well worth having.  There is a new version of this CD with a few bonus tracks.  I don't like the bonus tracks (with the exception of \\"triad\\" which can be found elsewhere).  With the bonus tracks CD costing twice that of the original CD (in 2011), I would definitely get the original 11 track CD and save the money.

B0000009SF|5.0|Frank Zappa/ The Mothers of Invention/ The Grand Wazoo:  This is a Jazz album, mostly instrumental, from a musical genius.  Zappa is often dismissed because he did so many albums with comic lyrics attached to his amazing music.  This Jazz album shows how very good Zappa was as a composer, and how excellent the musicians were whom he chose to be in his bands.  This is a Five-star album.

B000000643|5.0|Fairport Convention/ Unhalfbricking:  The title is a meaningless term apparently thought up by Sandy when the band was playing a word game.  However, this album is far from being meaningless.  This is a true classic.  This album has Sandy Denny's classic rendition of her own \\"Who Knows Where The Time Goes\\".  There are three Bob Dylan songs on the albums as well.  \\"Si Tu Dois Partir\\" is a french translation of Dylan's comic \\"If you got to go, go now\\".  Both of Dylan's songs, \\"Percy's Song\\" and \\"Million Dollar Bash\\" are released for the first time on this album, which made the album's release quite an event at the time.  All the songs on this CD are very good and easily earns Five stars.

B005YVTHT0|4.0|I am a gamer, have been a gamer for almost as long as I can remember. Right now, I currently game most on my PC, but I also own a Wii so the concept of steering and whirling around a detached controller is pretty second nature to me.   This is a niche product for a niche market kind of game that I think will work with some other games, but I haven't had a chance to check those out just yet.  I mention this because I found the simraceway game to have a pretty steep learning curve in that there really is no apparent tutorial that I could find. There are testing tracks and ways to practice, but they leave a lot to be desired. It was fun of course. It has been a long time since I tried to sink my teeth into a racing game, and I am probably a hardcore gamer by definition, just not in this area.  Some things to note, this controller came without a disc which means you have to download the game from the website.  Not only that, in order to get the game, you have to sign up for an account with them and then you get to download the game. It's a fairly good size download, about 1.15 gigs and it took about 16 minutes to download. I have a pretty good connection, so that was attributed to their server and size. My downloads from Steam and other services seems a bit speeder. Overall, between signing up account, downloading, installing it took about 30 minutes to get started. I also use Win 7 so there were no issues with finding the device and getting going. This isn't a complaint, just a potential issue for someone not prepared to have to get online and spend time there, say someone in our armed forces.  In terms of size, I find this controller to be a bit on the big size for comfort. I am guessing man hands might be right at home, but I found some strain gripping it and can't reach all the upper buttons and the pedals/shifts readily without playing around a bit. Again, even in that position, I found my fingers strained a bit, especially the thumbs. You would have to let go to hit the dials, which is fine of course and slide your hand down to get the camera and back buttons as well as the d-pad and select button. None of this is a deal break of course, just something to keep in mind if you are giving this to a lady friend or thinking it would be good for a young child.   As far as quality is concerned, it's a winner. The feel of the grips is good and not fragile, the pedals have give and are probably the first thing that will go on this controller but they are not flimsy by any means.  The dials are firm to turn but not difficult so they stay in place. Heck, even the cord is quality, a cloth-like feel to them less prone to kinks. I am so used to seeing companies cheap on peripherals that this is a real pleasure.  It will take me awhile to get used to really taking advantage of all the buttons and options and functionality of this wheel, but that is a good thing.  The fact it's not attached to something and is essentially an air wheel should not dissuade you.  That part was pretty easy to get used to pretty quickly.  I look forward to using this more and just hope I will find a more comfortable position to keep my hands so I can dig into gaming on this.

B0001AVZA8|3.0|Nancy Meyers has often been accused of writing oversweetened comedies about overprivileged people, and that criticism comes closest to being true in \\"Something's Gotta Give.\\" Because Meyers keeps such a tight focus on the late-blooming romance of record mogul Harry Seaborn (Jack Nicholson) and superstar playwright Erica Berry (Diane Keaton), the audience gets to linger on the Vanderbilt-like luxury of their lives. Twenty-room beach house in the Hamptons? Check. Vintage Bordeaux at dinner every night? Check. Corner tables at Le Bernardin and the Four Seasons? Check. Nancy Meyers may well live like this (and it's a cinch Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton do), but the fairy-tale aspect of this Champagne Dreams & Caviar Wishes lifestyle becomes almost oppressive after a while.<br /><br />I say \\"almost,\\" because, let's face it, it's lovely to spend time in a Hamptons beach house we'll never get to enter unless we're delivering flowers. It's nice to be there even when we're not particularly interested in the people who live there. For most of the running time of \\"Something's Gotta Give,\\" I couldn't have cared less whether Harry could overcome his addiction to dating women young enough to be his granddaughters and admit his love for Erica, the mother of one of his young conquests. Although I acknowledge that Jack Nicholson is a fine actor, I've never been a big fan of his; his too-cool-for-school attitude annoys me. On the other hand, I would gladly watch Diane Keaton even if she were playing Harry, and for most of the film's running time I felt Erica could do a lot better than Harry. There was even a better option right at hand: the handsome, obliging young doctor played by Keanu Reeves.<br /><br />\\"Something's Gotta Give\\" annoyed me in many ways, not least because it gives extremely short shrift to its gifted supporting cast. (What a waste of Frances McDormand, one of the world's greatest living actresses.) Yet, in its last ten minutes, \\"Something's Gotta Give\\" redeems itself, largely because Nicholson redeems himself. Harry finally drops his<br />attitude, and real emotion, real sorrow, comes through. So powerfully, in fact, that it brought tears to my eyes. In those few minutes, Nicholson proves he deserves every word of praise ever written about him, and it transforms the movie. Maybe he doesn't raise the film to four-star status, but maybe three-and-a-half. I liked \\"The Holiday\\" and \\"It's Complicated\\" better, but \\"Something's Gotta Give\\" overall is a pleasant film, especially if you love the stars.Nicholson redeems himself.

The original 8 tracks were not enough to make it a great album but this new 2 CD release adds so much that it earns a solid Five-star rating.

B004DNWPY4|2.0|This book makes about 10 very interesting an insightful points. However, it then beats you over the head with the same point for about 30 pages before it moves on.  For example, the vast majority of millionaires never inherited any money. This point can be stated and then expanded on as to why this was helpful in making someone a millionaire and why it might hinder some others. It warrants a good couple of paragraphs, maybe a page or two to get into the details. But this book will drag it on for 30 more pages, giving repetitive examples to dumb it down yet another way for us.  By about half way through this book, I had lost the will to become rich and almost the will to live. Then I found the answer, read the first two pages of each section, then skim on to the end of the examples and read the summary. Then next chapter please. You will be through it in no time and will have learnt plenty without being patronised.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|After avoiding this series for quite a while, I finally broke down and purchased the first book to kill some time and I am so glad I did. Katniss is independent, complicated, and a bit of a tom-boy. With the help of her bestfriend Gale, Katniss was forced to step into the role of provider for her mother and younger sister after father was killed in an mining accident. After volunteering to take her younger sister's spot in the Hunger Games--a yearly event in which the name of one male and one female tribute from each of the 12 districts are drawn and forced to fight to the death until one is left--Katniss must use her hunting skills to stay alive. The Games are graphic and brutal and leave you unable to break from reading. The ending leaves you desperately needing more and you will find yourself purchasing the second book that same night.
B00338QENI|3.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks / 1400052173<br /><br />I was really excited to read this for a book club; I'd heard that the book was really wonderfully written and informative. Now having read it, I'm really struggling with my review: how do you rate a book that has a great first half but which I only finished because I didn't want to show up to book club not having read the whole thing?<br /><br />The first half of this book tells the story of Henrietta Lacks, and how she came to be so incredibly important to the field of modern medicine. The chapters that cover the technology used to work with her cancer cells and which give a sort of 'history of modern medicine' overview are extremely interesting and informative, and well worth the investment of this book, I think.<br /><br />There's a lot of valuable discussion of the ethics of medical research, and how our understanding has grown and changed over the years. For instance, Henrietta's cells were used without compensation because the mentality at the time was that charity care in a free hospital meant that the patient's cells, once 'donated' for their own diagnosis, could then be used without permission and compensation for research. Whether or not this is fair to the person from whom the cells originated is a complex question that we've answered differently as a society over the years, and I appreciate the balanced look provided in the \\"science sections\\" of the book.<br /><br />Unfortunately, in the second half, this book tails into a sort of autobiography of the author as she follows Henrietta's surviving family and children around the country. And it's this half that is something of a slog to wade through. Everything discussed here is interesting, but it becomes repetitive quickly as the author covers and recovers the same ground (Henrietta's cells were taken without her permission; her surviving children have not been compensated adequately), and several members of my book club thought that the author toots her own horn enough to be seriously distracting.<br /><br />Worst of all, there's a feeling in several places that the author is carefully editing and editorializing the 'facts' in order to work peacefully with the family -- in the chapter where the children are abused by their new step-mother, for instance, you'd be forgiven for assuming that their father dropped off the face of the earth, because I'm not sure he even appears in that chapter once the new step-mom moves in. And, again, when Henrietta's daughter complains that she wants the scientists to tell her what her mother was like, and the things she enjoyed, it's frustrating as a reader to not be able to ask why her father (and indeed the community at large) isn't able to tell her these things -- after all, Henrietta and her husband grew up together in the same house!<br /><br />The second half of the book is framed in a sort of moral crusade: the family should be compensated for their mother's cells because they can't even afford proper medical care! I sort of agree with everything in that sentence EXCEPT the \\"because\\". I think the family should have universal health care regardless of whether or not they hit the genetic lottery in terms of their mother, and I also think they deserve some kind of compensation for all they've been through. I think by linking those two issues in a cause-and-effect sort of way, however, really obscures all the other poor people in Henrietta's community who are also being denied health care on a daily basis.<br /><br />I guess, in the end, I liked what I learned in this book, but the way it was presented made me feel like the author was pushing an agenda and a 'version' of history. That makes me uncomfortable in a supposedly non-fiction biography / science text, and so I'm not sure how much I personally recommend this past the first half.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardolly distracting.

1579128149|5.0|My son has read this book about 50 times. If I can get it away from him, I'd like to read it, too :-) It's also a gorgeous book that is well put together --- he's not the best about using bookmarks, but the binding is still holding fast.
B00475BUVM|2.0|So I am not a huge fan of this movie, but I bought it in 3D because frankly there aren't too many adult 3D movies out yet. I haven't even used the 3DTV all that much for movies, so when I bought this I was at first furious at my TV thinking the 3D feature is just a waste of time. After I watched about half of this piece of crap I popped in Yogi Bear 3D and it was about 1000x better as far as visuals go. If you like this movie and if you don't mind darker crappy 3D then I'd pick this up. Otherwise stay away. I even resold mine, and I never resell anything. I was that upset with the purchase.

1451627289|5.0|I have to say that this is the best King book that I have read in very a long time.  After King was injured when hit by a car his writting suffered a great deal. This book is from the King of old. The setting is 2011 and 1958-1963.  If you were around in 1958-1963 (as I was) you will indeed enjoy his description of the time.  The book is a page turner that includes murder, mob violence, illeagal betting and even an unusual romance. The book is basically about a time traveler who goes back to 1958 and hangs around until 1963 to stop the Kennedy assination plus a lot of happenings between 1958 and 1963.  If he stops the assination what will the new world be like?  Why 1958? that is the only time that he can enter the past.    Great reading and a page turner...Highly reccomended.
1451648537|1.0|I am a big Apple admirer, so I was very excited to read the book. I, however,  was disappointed after reading it. The book takes you from when Jobs was a child to about the time he died. The book, however, failed to really give the reader much additional information that most people familiar with Jobs didn't already know. The author also instead of merely presenting us facts, and allowing us to make up our minds, liked to take sides and make proclamations. For example, he presented both Jobs and Gates view on what Jobs viewed as Gates stealing the Mac OS. The author claims Jobs view was unfair to Gates, but doesn't tell us why. It is almost as if the author in his attempt to appear unbiased and not caught in the Jobs Reality Distortion Field decided to take anti-Jobs views on everything.<br /><br />Finally, the author is sometimes just wrong. For instance, he talks about how Jobs wanted to come up with something like i Cloud a long time ago, but goofed with Mobile Me. The author neglects to mention that Mobile Me actually started as free i Tools that people loved. I would have loved to learn why Apple changed from the free model to the paid model back to the free model. Moreover, he didn't really give us much insight into his personality other then what we already know (e.g. being a jerk). For example, once Jobs was said to say after meeting Yoko Ono he could see why John Lennon loved her, but doesn't give us an explanation as to why (most Beatles fans disliked her).<br /><br />At Jobs funeral, Cold Play and Nora Jones performed. The book doesn't explore the connection to many music artists other than Bono, Dylan, and the Beatles. The book is also confusing as it doesn't follow Jobs life in chronological order. It really doesn't seem to have an order at all.
B0068TJLSY|1.0|Certainly not a great family movie.  The story was completely boring and I could not wait till it was over.  There was a bunch of needless cursing too, especially by the children, and an F bomb, for what reason I have no idea.  Thank goodness I rented it for free with a promotion through Redbox!

She immediately took to it and began the changes indicated in the book.  Everyday for the next couple of weeks she was texting me that she had lost another 1-2 pounds per day.  She loves it!  Not saying it's a quick fix...and definitely not saying it's the \\"end-all-be-all of diets, etc\\"....but, it works for her.

B005RYF5JA|5.0|Well, I finally got to see Celtic Woman's new show, \\"Believe\\" on PBS. I really liked it! It was a great show that's beautifully done.<br />The dvd of \\"Believe\\" is viewable, not as bad as I thought it would be. I'm not an expert, as some viewers are, when they say it's not clear. I'm hoping they'll present us with a blue ray next time. There's always hope...<br />I do miss the beautiful Celtic Women, Lynn, Alex, Maeve and Orla, but these three ladies, Lisa K, Lisa L. and Chloe did a magnificent job. Mairead takes fiddle playing to a whole new level and is always a joy to watch.<br />Lisa Lambe, the new Celtic Woman, has a beautiful voice, blending well with Lisa Kelly and Chloë Agnew. They sang some popular Irish songs, along with the old classics. I'm blown away by how these three amazing singers with Mairead's fiddle playing kept the show going without any feelings of something is amiss.<br />I loved how Mairead played \\"The Foxhunter and \\"Mná na hÉireann\\",(\\"Women of Ireland). The dresses were so beautiful! Love the bagpipes, there's more of them this time. A Riverdance Irish Tap Dancer, Michael Gallagher. is also in this show which makes it an added appeal, especially when he taps when Mairead plays \\"Mná na hÉireann\\". Very cute and entertaining!<br />\\"Believe\\" is filmed for the first time in America at The Fox Theatre in Atlanta, GA. So, paying tribute to this charming theatre that's so famous for its broadway musicals, Chloe and Lisa Kelly sang, \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\". Lisa Lambe sang, \\"Circle of Life\\", who is joined later by Chloe and Lisa with the back-up group of singers. Very beautifully done!<br />I loved it when Lisa and Chloe sing \\"The World Falls Away\\" and Lisa Lambe joins in at the end, all three skip across the stage to finish the song These four Celtic Woman give high entertainment which makes you want to sing along.<br />I loved Lisa Lambe's \\"A Spaceman Came Traveling\\". She puts her all into the song and is not afraid to move around on the stage. Herdress flowed as she danced and twirled to this song.<br />Chloe's \\"Ave Maria\\" was resung by her more matured voice, and she did another amazing job. She didn't do too bad at age fifteen either when she sang another style of this song.<br />Lisa again gave it her all when she sang \\"Follow on\\" and \\"The Water is Wide. She still my favorite and will always be.<br />Here is a list of songs that will be on the dvd or the cd of \\"Believe\\".<br />*1.\\"Awakening\\"--Lisa Kelly, Chloë Agnew, Lisa Lambe with Máiréad Nesbitt (Opening song)<br />*2.\\"Nocturne\\" sung by Chloe Agnew accompanied by Mairead. (A winning song in the Eurovision Song Contest 1995)<br />*3.\\"Sailing\\" sung by Lisa Kelly, Chloe Agnew, Lisa Lambe accompanied by Maraid Nesbitt.<br />*4.\\"The Foxhunter\\" played by Mairead Nesbitt which was very entertaining!<br />*5.\\"The Water is Wide\\" sung by Lisa Kelly accompanied by Mairead Nesbitt (This is a folk song of Scottish or English origin.)<br />*6.\\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" sung by Kelly, Agnew, Lambe with the choir,'The Gwinnett Young Singers'. (This is a Paul Simon's song, he wrote it)<br />*7.\\"Black is the Colour\\" sung by Lisa Lambe (A Scottish folk song)<br />*8.\\"Follow On\\" sung by Lisa Kelly<br />*9.\\"Ave Maria (Schubert)\\" sung by Chloe Agnew<br />*10.\\"Téir Abhaile Riú\\" sung and danced by Lisa Kelly, Chloe Agnew, Lisa Lambe with Mairead Nesbitt and Michael Gallagher with his Irish tap.<br />*11.\\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\"  sung by Lisa Kelly, Chloe Agnew, Lisa Lambe with Mairead Nesbitt and \\"The Gwinnett Young Singers\\".<br />*12.\\"A Spaceman Came Travelling\\" sung by Lisa Lambe (A popular Christmas song in the UK)<br />*13.A tribute to Broadway sung by Lisa Kelly, Chloe and Lisa Lambe (Songs sung are \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" & \\"Circle of Life\\"<br />*14.\\"A Woman's Heart\\"  sung by Lisa Kelly, Chloe Agnew, Lisa Lambe (This is an Irish song composed by Elenor McEvoy.)<br />*15.\\"The Parting Glass\\" sung by Lisa Kelly, Chloe Agnew, Lisa Lambe with Mairead Nesbitt (This is a very popular Irish song and the last song they sung for this concert)<br />*16.\\"Green Grow the Rushes\\" is sung by Chloe and Lisa Kelly. This is a Irish folk song sometimes sung as a Christmas Carol.<br />*17.\\"The World Falls Away\\" sung by Chloe and Lisa Kelly with Lisa Lambe coming in at the end.<br />*18.\\"Mná na hÉireann\\" is played by Mairead with Michael Gallagher joining in later.<br />*19.\\"Smile\\" sung by Chloe, Lisa Kelly and Lisa Lambe with Mairead (Cappella)<br />*20.\\"My Heart was Home Again\\" sung by Lisa K. and Lisa L.<br />*21.\\"Walking the Night\\" sung by Chloe and Lisa L.<br />All I can say is, these are some amazing songs that Lisa Kelly, Lisa Lambe, Chloe and Mairead perform so well.  It's well worth the money to see and listen to them whenever you want in the privacy of your own home.

B004LWZW42|3.0|I didn't get to check this out when it was playing on the \\"big screen,\\" so I opted to rent and view by myself.  What I found was a movie that wasn't half bad.  \\"X-Men; First Class\\" tells the origins of the mutant gang a/k/a \\"X-Men.\\"  Two standout performances by the actors playing Xavier and Magneto kept the pace and action going.  You finally get the backstory of how the two characters were once best friends, but fate played a cruel trick and placed them at opposite ends of the spectrum.  Still, how could you not feel sorry for Magneto's character after you found out what had happened to him.<br /><br />The only real \\"problem\\" I had with the movie was the length.  I found it a little too long, and because of several \\"locations\\" jumped back and forth a little bit too much for me.  It's rated PG-13 and contains violence and language.<br /><br />All-in-all, not too bad.

B003Y5H5AQ|5.0|This is a great film for persons of all ages, its just right for kids, and adults will appreciate some of the more adult oriented jokes. Most of the violence is cartoonish I do not recall any language if there was it was very mild and there is a scene with some slight sensuallity but nothing to worry about. Most cartoon based movies end up being mediocre but not the Smurfs its much more enjoyable then other cartoon knock off films. If your lucky to get the blueray 3 disc set there is a third disc in dvd format of the smurfs christmas carol, a 23 minute high production full cartoon, which is equally enjoyable. Older smurf fans relive your childhoods and introduce the younger generation to a wonderful world 3 apples tall.

Otherwise, you may rip a patch of your drywall out of the wall when lifting your flashlight out.
0143034901|3.0|Carlos Ruiz Zafon is a book lovers' writer. His love for books and reading is evident throughout this book and \\"The Angel's Game.\\" The way he composes a sentence is the envy of every writer.<br /><br />This book is a story about a boy named Daniel, the son of a bookstore owner, who is taken to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books by his father when he becomes of age. [What lover of books would not want to go a place called the Cemetery of Forgotten Books?] This is a place where a book selects you, not the other way around. The book entitled \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" selects Daniel and is the start of his journey, which parallels the journey of the author of this fictitious book.<br /><br />Overall, this is a beautiful read, and would have rated higher except for the following reasons: 1) the repetitive use of the word \\"shadow;\\" I wanted to tell the author I understood the imagery or that, yes, he reached his goal of how many times he wanted to use this word; 2) the two parallel stories within this book were so similar that I was confused which characters belonged to which story.<br /><br />One cannot help comparing this book to \\"The Angel's Game.\\" Both were beautifully written, but I liked this plot better despite the confusion.
1608191664|1.0|I decided, against my better judgement, to give this book a shot. Within the first 10 pages I saw the author twice use \\"she\\" or \\"her\\" for the generic third person. This isn't the first book I've put down because of that. Political correctness has always left me cold. \\"He\\" and \\"him\\" have been used since the beginning of the language. Those who don't want to use that can always go with s(he) or him/her. Or her/him. Or they can use \\"they\\" or 'them\\" which are both listed as standard usage in Webster's and have been used since the 1700s. But those who have to prove how politically correct they deserve to be shunned. Their work probably has little of value.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|After first seeing this movie over a year ago, my now 7 year old still talks about it so much that I'm back to find him his own copy.  I find it a great introduction to art and image, an alternative to mass marketed Disney movies.  Once those movies are over, he only remembers the one liners and the special effects.  With Ponyo, he remembers the story, the depiction of human emotions.  A lot of it was fantastical, but he is most influenced by how Sosuke loved and cared.  This movie captivated him by showing the beauty in simple things like a bowl of udon or a slice of ham and I try to cultivate that as opposed to commercialism.  I can tolerate reruns of this a lot better than Ice Age!
0446571415|4.0|The book isn't great, but Baldacci has a recipe with Oliver Stone and the Camel Club for a suspenseful adventure with many  (actually too many)twists. The book was not exceptional, but for pure escapism, Baldacci is incapable of writing a \\"bad\\" book.   While to plot does linger too long, at least it doesn't totally fall apart like many others. If his next book isn't any better, I give him only 3 stars next time.

B002VWNICW|5.0|Okay, I'm female.  Yes this is my favorite film of all time.  I don't watch much TV but love a great documentary or movie.  And even then, rarely watch something twice.  This movie I have watched 15 times.  Not because I am obsessed, but because I keep sharing it with other people.  It's so beautifully filmed, the script is VERY clever, and SO FUNNY !!  This is Keira Knightley, Matthew Macfadyen, and Donald Sutherland's BEST WORK.  You will laugh, cry, dream, and have serious fun no matter who you are, what sex or age.  This is a classic story brought to film better than any I've ever seen.
1611760100|1.0|I really enjoyed MATCHED so I was looking forward to this, but I ended up not being able to finish it.

I never got invested, I was never eager to turn the page or anxiously speed-read towards the next chapter...this just didn't work for me. Bummer.

B0013FSXT6|4.0|I agree with Doug now that I bought this on Blu-Ray.  I don't think they did anything other than just take it from the original film over to the Blu-Ray format.  As such, it lacks the clarity of what I normally expect with my High-definition setup.  This is a good buy, just keep in mind that this is not going to be Blu-Ray quality when you get it.  However, I cannot complain because the Blu-Ray was cheaper than the DVD!  You'll get mixed reviews on the movie itself, but I never saw it when it came out and this was my first time seeing the movie.  I really enjoyed it and found that I was drawn in to the story to the point where I felt the stress Dr. Bill was going through.
B002ECJZ76|4.0|This is a foreign film with a completely different perspective on storytelling, acting, and staging. It is immediately obvious that English is dubbed in and the scenery and lifestyles represented are alien to anything most of us have ever known.<br /><br />Strangely those qualities become some of the strongest factors that make the film enjoyable; one feels as though one is getting a glimpse of life on a different world. The movie develops a fascinating ambience that draws one into the story which concerns a young boy who is orphaned and adopted by a poor fishing village in Lapland. The values presented are lofty and the characters are worthwhile human beings who are trying to do their best.<br /><br />This movie is a nice Christmas movie suitable for the entire family and promotes good family values.

B001MYIXAC|1.0|I don't know which version I saw, but question how much the translation really mattered since I doubt there were two pages of script in the whole 2 hr. movie.  I found it slow and boring and provided no background or answers.  It was impossible to tell how the two kids had a relationship other than from loneliness.<br /><br />The kiddie porn reference is because the pasty little boy is shirtless in about half of the movie and then there's the gratuitous shot of the girl's naked crotch which was totally unnecessary.  Since she has a 12 year old body forever, no duh that she's going to look like a pubescent kid, a shot of her body wasn't necessary (although I'm sure it wasn't the actress' real body.....one would hope) and added nothing to the film.

0439023521|5.0|This is not the type of book that I would normally read. Being a Prime member, I was looking for a book to borrow in the library that my husband would enjoy, as I am trying to get him to read more on the kindle and less from print. He never trades or gives away anything and we are starting to run out of room!   That being said, if you have an open mind about the content of each book you read instead of criticizing and analyzing every little detail, you should find that you have just opened the cover to a book that will take you wonderful places. Katniss faces a life that we will never have to endure. Choices between life and death, little in the way of modern conveniences. Isn't that kind of the point of reading a book? Escape the reality of your technical saturated world and climb into the life of a girl from a destitute land called District 12. You won't be dissapointed.
1593080220|5.0|Howards End is a powerful allegory demonstrating how people of different social classes had developed varying world views and philosophies of living in pre- WWI England. The Wilcox family are pragmatic , business oriented and purposefully active in material affairs. The Schlegels are old money, leisured , and drawn to the arts and cultural activities. Finally the Basts are a working class couple fallen on hard times.<br />As the story progresses these three seemingly disparate families with their very unique perspectives are drawn together by circumstances.  Their lives intertwine in a very complex web much of which wraps around the Wilcox' s country property Howards End.<br />Forster in my view seems to bring a more sympathetic view to the Schlegels and portrays the Wilcox family , particularly the father, as so concentrated on material concerns as to be out of touch with those around him. The Basts are focused on survival and drawn into this by the most insignificant coincidence, yet they are in some respects the catalyst for much of the conflict in the novel. The lives of these families are synthesized in the end in ways that are quite surprising and would never have been foreseen by the reader at the start of the novel.<br />Using the Schlegel and Wilcox  families to represent the societal conflict between materialism and the inner life , EM Forster created an allegorical story of great depth and insight. For those who enjoy the classics this shouldn't be missed.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Got it this morning.  Fits my Fire perfectly!  Adds hardly any weight, which is important because the Fire is fairly hefty.  Appears well made and excellently thought out and designed.  Highly recommend.
B004SBX112|5.0|great app. love the updates and all the new stuff. keep coming out with more. OK OK OK OK OK
B00005JKED|5.0|A rookie, Ethan Hawke, having completed 19 months on the police force decides, with marked trepidation, to join the narcotics unit. He spends a terrible, enlightening, and frightening day under the tutelage of Denzel Washington, who turns out to be a rogue cop who is pursued by the Russian mob, and who they threaten to kill unless he gives them one million dollars. Both Hawke and Washington are splendid in the film, which has a quick-moving plot, lots of drama, and violence. Washington won his second academy award for his acting in this film as a bad person, rather than his usual good guy image.<br /><br />Hawke undergoes many experiences during his day with Washington, including, among much else, being forced to take drugs and alcohol, letting criminals go free, stealing from them, breaking and entering, robbery, and murder. He is almost killed several times.<br /><br />It is interesting to watch Washington violate the system and ignore the interests of people he was sworn to protect and Hawke's reactions to what he sees and participates in.<br /><br />The film has a somewhat obscure ending, leaving us to decide for ourselves exactly how Hawke acted at the end. However the DVD has an alternative ending in which this issue is clear. I liked both endings.
B0058VW36U|1.0|I love this game but there's an update that is needed. Market has the updated version but Amazon is always so slow to get updates out there.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Anyone who isn't happy with this book is crazy. This book was just awesome. Could not put it down. Wish I had a time machine now though because I want to see them on the big screen.
B004132HZS|5.0|A friend recommended this series to me because I'm a huge Sherlock Holmes fan, and I was absolutely blown away by how true to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories this series is while at the same time making it modern. I think this show was perfectly cast; Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman make the perfect Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. I prefer them over Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law (although I do think they are a fantastic duo in their own right). The show is cleverly written and has as much action as it has comedy. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys Sherlock Holmes and/or a great TV series. I look forward to the second season!
B000OYC7A8|5.0|If you are/were a Floyd fan or just love David Gilmour, you won't regret this purchase at all.  The music is excellent and the video is very well recorded, as in, not to \\"artsy.\\"  I have watched this twice now and find it just gets better.  Crosby and Nash sing like angels and Gilmour and Wright are in top form...no surprise!  I think this is a real deal at the price given the length of the video, which is over 3 hours.  Just buy it.
B00004S3AN|5.0|I grew up listening to my dad play Take Five, Blue Rondo a la Turk, etc on reel-to-reel tape. I  purchased my own copy of the LP in college.  I picked up the Legacy multidisc CD in the late 1990's and was thrilled to find the SACD multichannel version in 2007.  Each play of the disc fills the room with an encompassing smokey and deliciously cool music, as fresh and new as the day it was recorded--only better.  The multichannel mix brings you onto the soundstage to experience Dave Brubeck, John Desmond and group play some of the finest jazz ever recorded.  It is simply the best listening experience of an album of songs that I love.  Kudos to remix engineers for they have done a fine job working with 1950s vintage master tapes.
B00008MJ8H|5.0|I searched for this soundtrack for years after seeing the movie. Gave up eventually, because it was not to be found. Just recently, I watched the movie again and decided to look for it again. And to my surprise, here it is.   Movie itself is one of the best in my opinion. But I don't think it would have been without this soundtrack. This probably is the best, the most beautiful soundtrack ever recorded. So haunting, emotional and powerful; perfectly captures every mood, every thought of the film. By listening to the first few seconds, the whole thing came back to mind.    I cannot believe I finally own it.
1594744769|3.0|I was intrigued with this book when I saw it in the store and purchased it for my Kindle. Like other reviewer's, I found the images and handwritten letters difficult to read on the screen.  I'm getting a little bit tired of authors who write with a series in mind, and this book is headed straight down that path. How many more books are we supposed to purchase to finally get to the end of the story? Writing a story around found vintage photos just didn't work for me, either. While the author managed to weave the characters into the tale, it felt a bit contrived and forced. Kind of like the movie, \\"Mama Mia\\" creating a story around ABBA songs.  That being said, the story line is original and the characters likable. I'll probably read the others when they are written, but I'll borrow them from the library instead of buying them.
B004Q9TYWQ|5.0|I saw a great web post with the 50 best autocorrect errors that the damnyouautocorrect site has found. It was so funny I was laughing out loud. Literally.  So I bought this book for Kindle and loaded it onto iPad. It was just hilarious! I couldn't put it down. It's a light read but the situations resonate so strongly. This book is aimed where social interaction and technology meet, and the human costs of imperfect machines taking part in the conversation are so clear and funny.  I laughed so long and hard that tears ran from my eyes. When's the last time a book did that to you?
B00466HN86|5.0|This is an amazing movie....a must see especially for fathers.  Very uplifting and inspiring. You  will cry and laugh.  Finally a movie that represents fatherhood in a good way.  I pray that this movie makes our fathers become the spiritual leaders God created them to be.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Well I'm #3177 here to give it a five star rating so far, and in my opinion and deservingly so. No need for me to ramble on, lots of other great reviews here for you to read...enjoy!

0307891372|4.0|I normally eschew strategy guides, but my wife's something of a completionist, so at $16 this was really hard to pass up.<br /><br />I won't go too in-depth, but after a few days of owning it I'm both awestruck and disappointed.  My thoughts, in no particular order:<br /><br />(1) How in the world is this not $30 or more?  There's no wasted space in this 656-page monster.  It's evident that a ton of time and effort went into it.<br />(2) I appreciate the subjective portions of the guide.  I like to read and agree- or disagree-with an author's assessments.  If you're selling a strategy guide, it's good to see some actual strategy.  There's not a ton of it here, but they did me a favor by highlighting skill perks I otherwise might have missed.  (Thank you Extra Pockets!  And thanks for pointing out how those Critical Hit perks are really sort of iffy.)  I rather wish there were a bit more of it.<br />(3) The book is so dense, it's easy to get lost in it.  This is not helped by some weird organizational choices and a rather barren and useless index.  So while I think everything is here - I can't say for certain.  You might find yourself jumping around from section to section for a single quest.<br />(4) However, the map is really nice.  Might be lamination-worthy.<br /><br />So it's five-star content, but the organization drops it down a star.  Still, it's amazingly worth the money.  Recommended, even though there's free alternatives online.
B0036T32LQ|2.0|I found I was drawn into the movie and the mysterious story line the longer it went.  And actually I thought it was an excellent mind twisting plot, very well acted, and very well directed.  But that was the problem.  Just when I was ready for the 'cycle' to be broken and for the movie to come to conclusion, there wasn't a conclusion!  It just started over again.  Many folks can overlook the ending and rate this movie highly, but I can't forgive the ending and how unfullfilled I felt after watching the movie.  The ending was such a let down and completely ruined the enjoyment of the first part of the movie for me and I felt like I had just wasted an hour and a half.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Since it is free for now.... try it... Decide for yourself.  Once it becomes a paid app... try it.<br />I would guess it would be worth between $.99 and $1.99 if I had to go and re-buy it. It is clean, handy, easy to use and will be one I will most probably keep on the first \\"shelf\\" of my favorites.  Nice Job...
B0067QPVD2|3.0|Let me start off by saying that I am a huge fan off the thing. I've been in love with it since I first accidentally rented at the age of 8. It's one of those movies that never gets tiring.  When I first heard about this prequel I was taken aback. Prequel? Why?  Norwegian Camp?  Wasn't it obvious what happened there? Exactly what happened to the Americans, except they lost. Suffice it to say I didn't see the need for one. But I kept my hopes up. I was actually going to see The Thing on the big screen.  Well...a Thing, anyways.  Then I heard news after news of bad things.  Newbie director?  Americans?  A chick?  But I was still resolved to hold judgment and not give into my inner hatred for these things.  And it payed off.  It was the Aliens to Carpenter's Alien. I mean that in the best way.  The movie was surprisingly good....almost above that even.  The direction was the weakest part off the bat, but even that isn't saying much. I see a bright future for MVH, even if he did cut his teeth on this prequel....(bastard)  The acting was good as well, they may not have felt like the fleshed out characters of Carpenter's, but they all felt like people. Especially Peder, Lars, and Colin.  The leads were good. They got the job done. I feel foolish for having doubted their ability.  The story was great. It was fun to go in and see how it all went to hell. Any fan, not a retentive one perhaps, would enjoy it. Hell, I think a non-fan would have a ball.  The effects, cgi this time around, were good as well. Except for two minor and horrifyingly bad instances, but they were brief enough for me not to care.  As a prequel it works phenomenally well. MVH wasn't lying about being a fanboy I'll tell you that. Except for one minor error it melds fantastically well into the Carpenter film. The ending will leave you in chills. I made sure people stayed at my viewing.  Rating: 7.5/10  Can't wait for this bluray.
B001HN6922|4.0|I received the DVD disc in late November.  We did not watch it immediately but the item had been well packed and the container was intact.  I placed the DVD into the player and everything played clear and crisp ... until the title was to play.  I received a read disc error message on the TV screen.  I then tried it again, but had the same result.  Going to the Disney website, I found suggestions under \\"FAQ\\" if you have trouble playing.  It recommended turning off the DVD player and then unplugging it for 5 - 10 minutes before plugging it back in and turning on the power.  It did not resolve the problem.  I called the Disney 1-800 telephone number for customer service.  I explained the issue and that I had obtained the disc from Amazon.  I was courteously treated and then connected to a patient technician.  I told him what I had done.  He told me that sometimes there is a build up of whatever is in the environment that can effect the playing surface.  He carefully instructed me as how to clean the disc.  I did that but, again, everything played except the movie itself.  I was promptly sent a postage free mailing label and a form to fill out device information, etc.  I have completed the form and sent the disc and container to Walt Disney Home Entertainment.  They felt that if any portion of the disc played so should the rest.  I am told that they will test the disc at their facility and determine the problem and replace if necessary.  I should note that I have heard from someone else who purchased the disc in a store and had the same problem.  Now to wait and see what happens.  UPDATE 23 DEC 11 - Just received a brand new 1 disc DVD from Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Consumer Relations Department, P.O. Box 3100, Neenah, WI 54957 to replace the one that I had obtained from Amazon.  I had filled out a lengthy form when I had sent them the first disc explaining the problems, all the info about the approximately 4 year old \\"expensive\\" DVD player / recorder, etc.  The return envelope had no letter / memo of explanation.  I put the new disc in the player which has been playing other DVDs without a problem.  This new Cars 2 disc played everything but the movie just like the first disc.  BUYER BEWARE!  So, I am out the money for the disc plus a good deal of wasted time and energy.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|My three year old daughter loves this app! Easy to use and a ton of features make this easily worth the purchase!
B0042MEQVG|2.0|A bit disappointed that the dvd I received was standard definition, not widescreen as the description stated - and didn't realize it until I was removing the plastic wrap :(
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love this game! fun fun fun... it helps to kill time when you are waiting for something. I use it at the airport all the time.
B005YDLJ76|5.0|I truly believe she should give a course on how to do a live show. I did not need the DC era again but as always she makes you love it any way. It's so funny looking at this and seeing just how preg she was but she still worked it. Beyonce and them vocals are always on point, she did not turn me away from being a STAN or what ever you call us die hard Beyonce fans. Beyonce shows why she gets much love and respect each and every  time she opens her mouth.  But for real, Beyonce, after giving birth you should open that school on How to Entertain.. First student should be Rihanna!
B0053YGYO4|5.0|So very rare in this world is a perfect album. An album of tunes or songs in which every one is good or perfect.  This is particularly difficult when it is a concept album, such as \\"Mylo Xyloto\\".  When you can pull it off, you find yourself with an album that fits like \\"Pictures at an Exhibition\\", telling a story in song. Few bands achieve it.  I am still waiting for my beloved U2 to do it.  Coldplay just did.<br /><br />  I have listen to every sing over and over and over.  I first had to pull the car over, I was so amazed. I ejected the disk to make sure it was Coldplay.  The songs tell a story of love and loss and dispair and love and more loss and finally...well buy it and listen to the songs on here and see how they fit together so perfectly.  Some are single record good like Hurts like Heaven, Charlie Brown, Paradise, Major Minor and the \\"Every Teardrop is a Waterfall\\" show stopper. But when you listen, notice the dancing in your head, the sudden appearance of Rihanna as the Princess of China, Xyloto (I have only heard her sing one other song called \\"Umbrella\\" which I loathe), the subtle recurring themes, the craft of the music.  She is wonderfully melodic though her voice is obviously pressed through a signal processor (or is it).  Also take note of how carefully Chris Martin uses his voice like an instrument.  This is not your fathers Coldplay.  This is a new, stadium monster Coldplay.  But every song seems to stand on its own.  Indeed, \\"every sound is a symphony\\" this time. As the Dr. says \\"Brilliant\\".
B000065V41|4.0|Buy the Full Screen version (Wide screen version is missing a key song).   My children love watching this film around Christmas time. The ENTIRE family does actually! This year is especially fun since we just took them to see the new Muppet film in theaters. Not entirely true to the original Dickens version, but close enough so children can get the general story and the moral.
B0031ES8P6|5.0|This doll is very cute.  It is a little smaller than I expected, but my daughter loved it.  She is a huge Hello Kitty and anime fan and hot pink is her favorite color - so it was win/win.  Overall, I'd reccomend this cute litte doll for any Hello Kitty girl out there.
B006HDLEY0|5.0|Few TV shows have a world, characters and relationships that are so well drawn and believable you feel for them as if they were real people. Supernatural manages this superbly. So when - as in this episode - a much loved character is in danger the emotional impact is huge.  The acting and writing in this episode are just amazing. You have to watch it. This is TV at its best. Watch, weep and (if you are an actor or writer) learn.
B004WDRT1Y|4.0|This movie is one of my FAV Disney Movies! But its ok in 3D. not AMAZING, but def not bad. You can tell a difference with the 3D, but it wasn't a GOTTA HAVE one, I'm glad I waited for the price to come back down to $29 if your looking at getting this its your call but I really think just the Blu Ray would be enough IMO. Still a GREAT DISNEY MOVIE!
B005DF2QMC|2.0|The cassette player itself was cheaply made and seemed to be of just a cheap plastic. The audio playback was poor and sounded distorted for the different tapes I tried to play. The software included is Audacity, which can just be downloaded from the Web. All you need is a cassette recorder and cord to connect to computer via the microphone port. I tried to then just use the software and couldn't because it wouldn't recognize the player, even after I'd followed the scant directions found in the instruction booklet. Do yourself a favor and find yourself a well-made cassette player and then just use Audacity from online.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Devices:  Samsung Epic Touch (SGSII) and Acer Iconia A500 Tablet<br /><br />I have picked up several office products so I can bring documents to meetings on my tablet (or if I forget - on my phone thanks to DropBox)... if I don't bring my laptop of course.  I have found myself using OfficeSuite Pro as my first choice of office applications and (up-to-date) I have been very successful in opening and editing all my MS Office 2010 documents (Word, Excel, PowerPoint).<br /><br />Disclaimer:  I read reviews where people had issues with different documents in each of the office products. That is why I have picked up 3 or 4 of them -- and since I am not hurting for space on my devices I carry them all.  I have NOT had any issues with any document.  But that is not a ringing endorsement that OfficeSuite Pro is flawless or better at compatibility.  I think all of the products had reviews that someone had some document that stumped them.  I can only tell you that up-to-now... I haven't been that unlucky.<br /><br />I like the way the product is laid out.  Editing in word is amazing (especially with USB keyboard connected to tablet :).  Of course it takes a bit of time to find the features - but they were very quick to pick up and remember once I started using them.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|This is a fantastic blues collection. Hugh Laurie's piano and vocal abilities are amazing, absolutely amazing. The whole ensemble and production is exceptional, too. This CD makes an totally accessible addition to the PBS Great Performances episode where we're able to follow him on a road trip to his personal holy land, New Orleans. There are no borders: British, black, white, or otherwise; just GOOD music.
B000TM1CL0|5.0|Received this item as a used set.  The shipping was acceptable and the item arrived in good shape and all disc played through without incident.  I will purchase from this vendor in the future, it seems their ratings on used items are accurate.  A good value and alternative for a new purchase.  Caution, not all vendors ratings are the same.  Some embellish their conditions of disc.  Search for the highest rated vendors and please report feedback.
0316078913|1.0|I'd heard how wonderfully funny David Sedaris's writing is and looked for to my book group's December read, and the first story was entertaining,  but had to force myself to complete the 2nd story.  Not for the faint of heart.
B004EPZ06Q|3.0|The first HANGOVER was a bit of comedy genius: a film featuring three guys most people hadn't yet heard of, in raunchy situations that would normally alienate a large part of the general audience.  Yet it was a hit, because it had a quality that so many comedies today lack: it was funny.  Director Todd Phillips and company were unafraid to \\"go there,\\" to push buttons and risk offending people, all in the name of comedy.<br /><br />HANGOVER PART II is pretty much the same, except this time the guys are in Bangkok, and there's a drug-dealing monkey.  Even Mr. Chow is back, although his character really isn't important (Ken Jeong provides quite a bit of humor, but we're always painfully aware he was brought back to satisfy fans).  Paul Giamatti has a nice bit, as does Nick Cassavetes (in a role originally intended for Mel Gibson, then Liam Neeson; it would have been nice to see either actor in the roll, but Cassavetes is good).  The leads are as solid as they were in the first film; their elevated star status hasn't diminished their ability to deliver quality performances.<br /><br />It seems like I'm harping on the film; and in many ways, this harping is justified. HANGOVER broke new comedic ground; it wasn't revolutionary, but it was unique among modern comedy films.  HANGOVER PART II doesn't do this; it is a retreading of the first film, from the basic plot point (to be expected) to some of the more minor details (which makes things much too predictable in spots).  There are some memorable bits (a stripper surprise, which pushes the envelope, and Giamatti's ever-reliable presence), but ultimately HANGOVER PART II melds with the first film, becoming the weaker second act.  This isn't a horrible thing (it's still funny; note the 3 stars), but it's somewhat disappointing, considering the quality of its predecessor.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Recomiendo ver y oir. esta. version de la vida de Cristo Jesus.  I recommended the live of Jesus Christ from this version.
6305128952|2.0|I received this movie and was very disappointed when it arrived.  It is a Movie Gallery rental and the labeling on the disc cannot be removed.  Even though the packaging was acceptable the item should be identified as not original.  The disc played through without a problem but I will not purchased from a company that does not represent its product accurately.
B004KAB5QO|3.0|Susan Hill was onto a winner with her 1984 novel Woman in Black and reawakens that genre - the British ghost story - here. She spins a brisk yarn, telling the story of a mysterious picture in a retired Cambridge Don's study that unleashes terrifying consequences on those who possess it. The settings tick all the relevant boxes - Cambridge study, hail rattling at the window; London auction house; northern England widow's country home; Venetian canal scenes.<br /><br />The plot unfurls like a well made umbrella and not a word is wasted with the narration revolving in the first person across several protagonists (rather like Wilkie Collins' Victorian Classic The Woman in White). Susan Hill is a very English, unflashy short of stylist. Her prose is clear and limpid, reading as if she has written this novel on a few spare afternoons in between running her publishing house in the morning and knocking up a quick shepherd's pie for supper guests in the evening.<br /><br />Susan Hill is no producer of vacuous potboilers however. Certainly she has a natural affinity for the genre, yet, as with some other reviewers, I agree the story lacks the depth and power to be a real, classic English chiller.
B005N95JA4|5.0|At long last, some unreleased material worth purchasing.  Although I do agree with the reviewer who points out that there could easily have been much more on disc 2, the quality of what is included is so good, and so legitimate, this set deserves five stars.  I was disappointed beyond description with the Exile reissue, largely because of the recently added vocal tracks/lyrics.  Of the songs on disc 2 of Some Girls, only two or three suffer the same fate, and it is not as noticeable in any event.  I owned a two lp set of some of these outtakes in 1982, and I can say for certain that at least half of these songs (including the killer opening three tracks) appeared there in substantially the same form.  On balance, what you get from the second disc are quality songs that simply did not make the final cut for various reasons ranging from threat of litigation to overall feel/mood.  Many of the songs are better than anything the Stones have released since, but more overtly blues or country than most of Some Girls. As for the original lp, it remains one of my favorites and the last truly great Stones album.  To my ears, the remastering is the best yet.  Definitely a worthwhile purchase.
B004EPYZTE|1.0|Friends were telling me that I gotta go see it. That this how Conan should be.  I dont know where all those shill 5 star reviews came from but obviously it had to be studio people. This movie could have been a made for TV film. Unoriginal, plodding, the usual straw huts for burning, the boy looking for revenge for father and people.  Sorry, say what you will about the corniness of Ahnolds movie but at least it was good adventure, even if you had to laugh at many scenes the way they played out. This guy who looked Mowgli from the Jungle Book movies, not cartoon, was wooden and too restrained as if afraid that if he gave it his all he would be accused of being over the top, which I prefer in movies like this. I appreciate that the wanted to be more serious but in doing so took it to extremes. The scenery was even much to look at. Sorry. Give me Ahnold and James Earl Jones snake cult and more popcorn and coke and shine this.

B005HP2JAM|5.0|I was lucky to see this in 3D when it first came out in the theaters. Director Herzog takes full advantage of 3D technology for you to see how those ancient artists used the textures and naturally formed shapes to create such masterpieces of art.
B003YNFYCO|5.0|The red album was the first album that my dad got me. The Red and Blue albums are a great to introduce people to the Beatles.
B002ZG981E|3.0|Inception was a smart concept beautifully photographed and well written but I felt suffered from competition from a similar DiCaprio film that was superior-  Shutter Island.  In a very visual film there was still an abundance of exposition which unfortunately made Ellen Page come off as preachy, shrill and ultimately  unbelievable.   The imagery alone is worth the price of this very beautiful blu ray.
B005TZFZJC|4.0|Rihanna's fifth studio album, [[ASIN:B005HWUCMC Loud]] was a disappointment.  Sure Loud featured massive hits including \\"What's My Name,\\" \\"S&M,\\" and \\"Only Girl in the World,\\" but cohesively, it felt to be Rihanna's most scattered, uninspired set. Surprisingly, recently it was announced the effort was nominated for multiple Grammys, including album of the year - go figure.  Regardless, Rihanna's sixth effort [[ASIN:B005TZFZJC Talk That Talk]] is a much more capable effort than Loud.  It is less compelling in comparison to the valedictory [[ASIN:B0018S6YO4 Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded]] or the dark dabbling of [[ASIN:B002UXRH10 Rated R]], but it mixes respective catchiness and naughtiness of both efforts well.<br /><br />\\"You Da One\\" is an excellent way to open the set, though a bit surprising.  Many might have expected the driving \\"We Found Love\\" to open the effort.  The production by Dr. Luke (and also Cirkut) is a bit of a contrast to their typical production work, but that is also part of the beauty here. All puzzlements aside, Rihanna sounds superb, the refrain is catchy (\\"you're da one that I dream about all day...), and the production is a '10.' \\"Where Have You Been\\" does a fine job of contrasting the previous cut, containing elements from another song (\\"I've Been Everywhere\\" as penned by Geoff Mack). Another Dr. Luke/Cirkut contribution, it doesn't quite live up to \\"You Da One,\\" but it works well.  The biggest rub? over-repetition and overwrought duration given that repetitiveness. Thankfully, Calvin Harris featuring/produced \\"We Found Love\\" atones for any improprieties.  The production is bright and the songwriting addictive - what more can you ask for from Rihanna?<br /><br />\\"Talk That Talk,\\" featuring Jay-Z samples Notorious B.I.G. (\\"I Got A Story To Tell\\") yielding more excelling results.  Jay-Z's opening verse is very arrogant (`braggadocio' one might say), but certainly lifts the song.  Rihanna explores her lower register, which is a solid point of her voice.  \\"Cockiness (Love It)\\" is an even strong cut, opening with sort of a lo fi upright piano sound.  Shondrae \\"Mr. Bangladesh\\" Crawford's production work is a nice union with Rihanna's spunky vocals.  While \\"Cockiness\\" is dirty and nearing X-Rated, Rihanna sounds `on fire.'  The too short \\"Birthday Cake\\" is another solid cut, even at only 1:18.  The production work (Da Internz, The-Dream) is solid, particularly the successive claps and devastating synth sounds.  The vocal production surrounding Rihanna's lead and background vocals are a highlight.<br /><br />\\"We All Want Love\\" is not a flashy cut, but works solidly, though not exceptionally.  Rihanna sings this song very well over producer NO ID's old-school drums.  \\"Drunk on Love\\" is a better cut, with Swedish production team StarGate (Ne-Yo, Beyonc&eacute;, Wiz Khalifa) adding a lift.  Rihanna's vocals are grit-laden, though not as emotionally raw as her valedictory showing on \\"Russian Roulette.\\" StarGate stick around for another solid showing on \\"Roc Me Out.\\" Songwriting is solid and at times edgy, particularly lines like: \\"Give it to me like, I want it...roc me out back and forth, rock me out on the floor..etc.<br /><br />Hit-Boy produces the solid \\"Watch N' Learn,\\" a light-hearted cut the contrasts all previous cuts. The standard edition of the CD closes with the adult contemporary cut \\"Farewell,\\" produced by Alex Da Kid, which is shockingly much better than one expects it to be.<br /><br />Of the bonus tracks, \\"Fool in Love\\" may be the most alluring, yielding strong vocals by Rihanna showcasing her vocal prowess.  \\"Red Lipstick\\" is sleazy-sounding, but a bit of a disappointment.  \\"Do Ya Thang\\" is better than \\"Red Lipstick,\\" though still a `B.' Some editions also sport \\"We Found Love [Extended Mix],\\" which proves the original version is satisfactory enough.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B005TZFZJC Talk That Talk]] is a solid sixth showing from the Barbadian pop/R&B singer.  This effort does more to cement Rihanna's artistry than 2010's Loud did by all means.
B005EY2XFC|4.0|Having already seen the movie in theaters and on VHS years ago, I already know The Crow was a great movie. Finally having the Bluray released this October, I was unable to purchase it locally. The picture was beautifully mastered. The interviews, particularly those with James O'Barr and the late Brandon Lee made some great Special Features.  Had the item not been shipped in a mere flexi-bubble envelope, resulting a shattered jewel case, I would have rated five full stars. Luckily, there are third-party suppliers for replacement cases at minimal expense. It just sucks that I have to get one for a brand new product.
B003VANOFY|5.0|This is an awesome headset, works as described.  I would advise to pick up a ac to usb charger tho, i found   charging from your pc does get bothersome.  I use  the apple ipad charger to charge when i'm not using  cause i do't leave the pc on when i'm away.  i would like to logictech develop this headset into  a karaoke type headset with a flash chip to upload tunes and   have the mic useable in singing with songs so   you to hear yourself in with the song.
B003TOH8AE|5.0|I loved this movie.  It was a great combination of dark, disturbing and funny.  It's not something I would normally watch, but I have to admit I was curious about it based on the reviews.  I was so glad I picked this up.  This movie was fantastic; one of the best movies of 2010 by far.  There were some really stand-out performances by Nicolas Cage (Big Daddy), Chloe Grace Moretz (Hit Girl) and Aaron Johnson (Kick Ass aka Dave).  Dave's two nerdy friends Todd (Evan Peters from American Horror Story) and Marty (Clark Duke) gave great comic relief.  I have to admit, I was really surprised by the level of violence, but not enough to be turned off by the movie.  It's definitely an adult movie; not for the kids.<br /><br />Dave is your average teenage boy who loves comic books, hangs out with his geeky friends Marty and Todd, and has fantasies of becoming a super hero until he actually is one.  He gets himself into a lot of trouble and his new hobby soon becomes way too dangerous when he inadvertently pisses off a major crime boss.  He meets Hit Girl and Big Daddy when they save him from what is sure to be a death sentence.  In an attempt to gain his crime boss father's approval and bring back Kick Ass, Chris aka Red Mist pretends to be a friend to Kick Ass.  He soon realizes there is a much bigger threat to his criminal father's business and plans to take out Big Daddy begin.  This is when things get really out of hand.<br /><br />This movie was absolutely fantastic and I highly recommend it.
B004EPZ06Q|1.0|I have to chime in and agree with customers so far about the Ultraviolet digital copy. In the past I've always ordered versions with digital copies even if it means a few extra $$ as I would gain a copy for my iTunes library. Recently, though, Warner has gotten on the Ultraviolet bandwagon. Ultraviolet is a somewhat clunky online service that manages your copy for you. While you do technically receive a digital copy, you cannot import it to anything other than the Ultraviolet library. Those of us who enjoy the iTunes crossover will be sorely disappointed.   Lessons learned? Yes, and they are two-fold. First, when Amazon lists the movie with digital copy initially, there has not been an indication that the digital copy was any different than in the past. The 'Ultraviolet Digital Copy' that now appears in the header is new to those of us who placed the order early. In a sense, we're not getting what we've ordered. To be fair, this is NOT Amazon's fault. I'm also certain that they would accept a return/cancel the order for the simple reason that you won't get what you were expecting. So, the lesson here is to watch for the studio that is releasing the movie and keep in mind that they are likely employing Ultraviolet, and then act according to your preference even if the initial indication is that your copy is simply digital or Ultraviolet digital.  Second, figure out whether you mind Ultaviolet. Clearly, there is enough of an outcry against it that it appears Warner is making its customers unhappy. Protest by not buying the slightly marked up version with the digital copy and continue to lower the ranking here, which is clearly the case with the last Potter film considering the overwhelming number of single-star rankings. I'm still too dearly attached to the idea of having a copy to watch on my iPod or iPad so Ultraviolet remains a far, far inferior solution to the digital copy question. Will it stop me from buying versions with Ultraviolet digital copies? Maybe - butsometimes the difference in cost is very small, if we even have a choice in blu ray versions of the film.   Regardless, this is simply a move toward greater proprietorial behavior on the part of digital media providers. As much as technology opens up tremendous opportunities for crossover, it's only a matter of time before someone decides that they aren't making enough money or that they are losing too much control over their product, and then moves to change the rules, ultimately to the displeasure of the consumer. More one star reviews are likely on the way as we are persuaded less by the content and more by the 'packaging'.
B004EPZ07K|1.0|I always make it a point to buy discs that include a digital copy that I can import into iTunes and take with me on the road. If this is also what you do, DO NOT BUY THIS DISC. Their \\"UltraViolet\\" digital copy is only available via Flixster and there is NO WAY to import the movie into your existing iTunes library. I'll never buy another disc with the UltraViolet so called \\"digital copy\\". Be warned.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Love the game, finished it 100%, recommend it fully. I enjoyed om non and his antics and found getting him candy very accomplishing. Found out I was lacking multiple levels and updates that have been out for quite some time. When will amazon get with the times? I'm insulted updates that have been available for months are not up for download on my kindle fire.
0321704452|4.0|I approchaed this book as a rote reading assignment for a class I was in at the time but quickly started to enjoy it as I got started.  It's full of engaging stories and techniques some of which actually stuck with me and helped me quite a bit in my struggle to overcome a debilitating fear of public speaking (not nearly as bad as it used to be, BTW).  My greatest lessons learned here were making your presentation simple - use Powerpoint if needed but don't realy on it and if you do use slides make them bold and clean.  Learn to tell stories as you present - you engage the audience and stories are far easier to remember as opposed to a list of memorized facts.
0634049011|5.0|This is a workbook in which you work out the scale patterns, note locations, and octave repetitions throughout the fretboard. If you do the exercises and practice what you've written on the guitar, you will learn a lot.  I'd recommend buying the paper version of this, since it's a workbook with diagrams that you are meant to write on, which is not as easy on the Kindle.
B004EPYZT4|2.0|Jason Momoa hit every note perfectly - not only does he truly look like REH's description of the wild barbarian (unlike the previous film incarnation), he sounds and acts just like the Conan of the novels. Sadly, it's the stupefying one-dimensional direction that sinks this film. A list of what it lacks is equal to the weights Momoa must have lifted to achieve those amazing pecs.<br /><br />What surprised me most was learning the film cost $70 million dollars to make, yet the flick feels and plays low-budget. I have to wonder what happened to all that funding? The CGI was adequate, hardly the jaw-dropping spectacle I was hoping to see. And this soon-to-be-on-SciFi-Saturday certainly did not expend its funding on a proven director. Just what about Marcus Nispel's resum&eacute; said he could guide an established action cache attached to such a historical fanbase? To live up to and exceed expectations? Stunning shortsightedness on the part of the producers is the only reasonable explanation in hiring someone whose background is music videos. Even a commercial director has some sense of character development, of pacing a story, and depth of characterization. Music video directors are their neo-hippie drooling step-cousins; their flashy productions don't even have to make sense.<br /><br />And it would be an understatement to say I was let down by screenwriters Thomas Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer. They previously scripted a favorite flick in '[[ASIN:B0009UC7H0 Sahara]]' with Matt McConaughey, so I presumed their story would be the foundation upon which fans could be proud. Instead, we're delivered a half-baked mess with only the flimsiest pretense of a plot.<br /><br />Further, with the sole exception of the always enjoyable Stephen Lang, I found many of the bad guy actors woefully lacking and uninspired. Especially the inner circle of henchmen who were appallingly flat, leaving a great deal to be desired. And coming from a fan of Rose McGowan: Having seen similar roles in a variety of flicks - her performance, while spot-on for her character - lacked a unique style that she could call her own. In my opinion all this, again, lands directly at the feet of Director Nispel. He could've easily gotten more from his artists. Lack of ability and lack of experience shows through on virtually every superficial and inadequate scene.<br /><br />What made this even more cringe-worthy was the cinematography - Nispel reveals his music video background with every multiple close-up and laughable posed shot.<br /><br />Then there's the car-sized plot holes:<br /><br />Example: The chief bad guy and his wannabe incestuous daughter are pulled all over creation in a giant boat. Why? No clue. It's never explained. It certainly seemed important - obviously we're supposed to be intrigued that this humongous water craft is being dragged over dry deserts and high mountains. And bleep me, they sure spent a lot time (money?) making sure we got to see that thing from every angle; as Nispel spends an inordinate amount of film getting it in almost every shot.<br /><br />Again - why? Can one even have a boat fetish?<br /><br />Following up on the logic of that boat. The bad guy's intent is to become a god as soon as possible, be reunited with this dead wife, and rule the world. Okay, got that part. And in order to facilitate all that, he and his thugs have to run all over the countryside to locate the various missing pieces so their boss can perform the profane ceremony, check. So then why take a massive ocean voyaging ship over hard scrabble land? Don't think that's going to expedite your mission dude, quite the opposite. In fact, why not just use a bunch of horses? You know, the whole 'speed' thing. If he was in such a flipping hurry, this bad guy sure took his sweet ass time. If this were a more serious film, I would hazard a layman's psychiatric analysis and suggest he subconsciously didn't want to proceed and did everything he could to actually slow downthe process.<br /><br />Stuff like this is what's so infuriating - these are simple issues to work out in pre-production. Having the director and writers sit down over one long lunch and incongruities like these can be addressed, long before a single strip of film passes through the cameras.<br /><br />Overall, it was an okay flick, but I had higher expectations. Love Momoa's version of the Cimmerian, and again, Stephan Lang can do no wrong as far I'm concerned. Sadly, the production just lacked depth and tangible quality.rocess.<br /><br />Stuff like this is what's so infuriating - these are simple issues to work out in pre-production.

B002VRZEYM|5.0|I am shocked at what is in our food and who really controls all aspects of what we eat.  Everyone needs to watch this!!!
B0053TMP24|5.0|I'm an adult and absolutely love children's and young adult fiction because it's so much more fun and imaginative than adult fiction!  As a HUGE, HUGE fan of the Harry Potter series who's also always loved Greek mythology, I decided to see what all the fuss was about over the Percy Jackson books a few years ago and found these Olympic series books to be quite entertaining.  Rick Riordan's teens are funny, brave and even though they're demigods, they're also still human enough that young adult readers can easily relate to them since they're battling their respective insecurities, dealing with crushes (ah, young love!), learning all about teamwork and respecting friends, and handling parental relationships.  While their quests are for specific purposes, the underlying theme through each quest is learning more about who they really are as people and that's the journey we all begin when growing up as teens.  PLEASE NOTE: This book is the second book of the sequel series to the original Olympic Heroes and I'd definitely recommend these books to kids at least 12 years or older, and for adults who enjoy entering a fun, mythological world...but start with the original Percy Jackson series if you haven't already.  It's not that this new series won't make sense if you start with this one, but you'll have a much better understanding of the series, characters and background as a whole if you've read the original Percy Jackson series.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Fun game that'll keep you busy for hours.  I like the features and options that make it easier or more complex.
B00447G29S|5.0|Wonderful movie to watch in 3D in your own livingroom.  The snow that was falling in the movie, looked like it was falling right in my own livingroom.  Awesome colors, and a truly magical way to watch a truly wonderful movie for the holidays.
B004GCPJDQ|4.0|One day, not too long ago, I was really frustrated with charging batteries for my mouse. I was using Eneloops but finding my charger and people stealing my charged batters was a hassle. So I thought...c'mon there must be a better way to do this...and there is!  My Mobee charger has worked pretty flawlessly. I've had no issues with the battery pack. When I see my battery is getting low I put it on the charger over night and I'm good to go. The only slight issue I've had is that at one point my mouse was fully charged and the OSX mouse battery indicator was telling me it was 4% charged. I turned the mouse on and off and it then indicated as full.  So far I love this thing! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it's kind of pricey.   I am planning to get the keyboard charger soon..I just need to convince a family member to trade me her 2 battery keyboard for my 3 battery one.
0061547840|1.0|This book did disappoint me. Despite of the title it does not teach readers who to get success in life nor correctly explain how Trump himself became successful. Half-baked. Thumb down.
0307292134|1.0|This man has no interest in completing the series in any comprehensive or comprehendable way. he kills off the most interesting characters with any redeeming qualities and randomly introduces new characters.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|For anyone having playback problems then it's either time to update your firmware or upgrade to a player that can connect to the internet.  I was worried about this blu-ray because of all the people saying that they couldn't play the movies in their players. When I received this set I popped the first disc in right away and it played right away. Also it was gorgeous. This is a stellar product and at the reduced amazon price it is a must own for everyone.  Even if you have the most recent DVD releases this release blows almost any other release of any other franchise, DVD and Blu-ray alike, out of the water and into space. MU-Th-UR mode is incredible and this set comes packed with tons of other extras and new commentary by the directors for all four films (with the exception of Fincher for Alien 3.) The films are stunningly beautiful and the sound is fantastic. This is how releases should be handled and truly sets the bar. Truly exceptional.
B0068TJLSY|1.0|After the first ten minutes of the movie, I was ready for a nonstop sci-fi thrill ride. I was extremely disappointed. The rest of the movie is completely disjointed and has no idea what it should be. Way to many plot lines and none are fully resolved.   And just out of curiosity, why would the AIR FORCE put the world's most valuable military secret on an unguarded train; traveling through the middle of the country?
1451627289|5.0|This is definitely one of Stephen King's best books.  Even though we associate King with horror, this story is not of that genre.  It is basically a love story between a man from the 21st century and a woman from the mid twentieth century.  The JFK story about stopping the assassination, though definitely interesting, is not the main focus of the story.  This is a gentle story that takes place mostly in the \\"innocent\\" 1950's and early 60's.  It also discusses what happens to the future when we change the past.  The story and quality of writing were so good, that I literally couldn't put this book down!!
1400069181|4.0|Not only was it fun to read the development story of TOMS Shoes from the ground up. It was very inspiring how one simple idea can transform into a tangible business that really makes a difference around the globe. The book is peppered with other business stories who are giving back as well as offering insightful practical steps to take your idea and develop it into a formidable business. A few of the chapter titles are: Tell Your Story, Face your Fears and Keep It Simple, really offer a canvas of empowerment. The simplicity of insights create a practical platform for stepping out and launching your own business. \\"A lack of resources is no reason to avoid starting a company.\\" Blake Mycoskie. This book truly eliminates excuses, offers wisdom and gives weight and feet to the ideas running around in your head. If you have an idea or are considering starting a business, I would highly recommend this book. It will be a great motivation for you to Start Something That Matters.

0439023513|5.0|I was really worried about this last book when I read all the reviews. However, I thought it was a great conclusion to the series. Yes, I did like the other two books a little better because I like the characters being in the hunger games, but I still really enjoyed this book and didnt want the series to end. If you have read the first two you have to read this one to see what happens to our favorite couple and all the other inhabitants of Panem. I, for one, cant wait for the movies!
8862931921|5.0|For years I have used plain, unlined notebooks for work as my portable brain - everything goes in them from notes to taped-in meeting agendas to whatever - and every single brand I ever tried took the beating and looked it.  The spines broke, edges frayed, etc.   Not this baby, though.  It looks clean and crisp and fantastic; a much better image for a professional to convey.  The band holds everything together, the pocket in the back holds business cards and peppermints, the little ribbon helps me keep my place.  I've even begun giving them as gifts to staff.  Moreover, writing on the paper with a fountain pen is a sensual delight, and saves my creaky old right hand much fatigue.    LOVE IT.
1400164990|5.0|This book covers a lot of ground and is a good primer for somebody looking to distill the difference between Western and Eastern civilizations. The author gets sidetracked every now and then (e.g. WWI side note is way too long), but it makes all the right points. This book is bound to upset all politically correct and agnostic relativists that are directly blamed between the covers for the potential downfall of the Western culture and civilization.
B000TEMRIU|5.0|I LOVE this album! Came out while I was in high school and really speaks to me. I was bummed when I couldn't find my CDs but this works for me.
0553384775|2.0|I've just finished reading this book and feel it's worth mentioning a few things to people who are considering reading it.  1) If, like me, you read a lot of fiction written by professional authors who make a living from writing then you will need to lower your standards considerably for this book. It's very badly written. Fair enough, Jordan made a go of writing it himself, but I really feel the book could have been so much better if he worked in closer conjunction with an author to write this on his behalf.  2) At times it just seems like he's trying too hard. He is constantly reminding you of how expensive everything is and throwing price tags into the story at every opportunity. It just gets tiring and desperate.  3) There is not a great deal about how his business actually worked, so if you're a trader or aspiring trader I wouldn't recommend it. There is generally a lot more focus on the subsequent money he made from the business itself.   4) The book is badly structured. The story doesn't seem to flow the way that of a good book should. It could almost do with being condensed and then re-organised. The ending leaves a whole boat load of question marks.  At the end of a book like this you tend to draw your own conclusions about a person. My conclusions are probably not that in line with the character Jordan tried to portray and I have to stress that these are just my own conclusions:   The fact that after everything he's put his wife through she stayed with him, and then after living with her for a period of 2 years ( I think) completely sober, she dropped him the moment he got indicted suggests he didn't have a whole lot to offer other than his money. Essentially he just comes across as that typical ego-centric Wall Street trader who becomes so reliant on his money to get everything in his life, that once you strip the money away, you're left with big-headed prick (with short man syndrome in this instance) that no one wants to be around. Ironically Jordan tries so hard to depict himself in a particular way in this book that it completely backfired on me and I ended up despising him towards the end.
0439023491|4.0|Like the first book in the trilogy, Catching Fire is compulsively readable.  That said, much of the story is placeholder:  The early parts are a recap of the previous book.  The new Games, while definitely exciting, felt a bit redundant with the first book.  The ending is such a cliffhanger that it almost demands reading the third part of the trilogy.

Liam Neeson is an excellent actor in any movie he's in, but this one is just awesome and it was really unexpected as to what it came out to be. i didn't want to do one of those \\"spoiler\\" reviews. so i'll leave it this for now. it's a MUST SEE movie!

B004I8WD6E|4.0|This case is less than half the cost of most other cases, and yet the quality is right up there.<br /><br />I have a white iPhone 4S, and it looks great.  It doesn't hide any of the design of the iPhone 4S, which I like.  Apple's product is beautiful, why would you want to cover it up with an ugly case?<br /><br />The material is a flexible plastic, and the clarity of it is quite good -- think transparent more than translucent.  The fit is very tight -- this is clearly molded to the exact specifications of the iPhone 4 and as a result, it fits like a glove.  This would fit an original iPhone 4 (GSM), a CDMA iPhone 4 (Verizon / Sprint), and the iPhone 4S.<br /><br />I don't think this is going to provide the best shock / drop protection in the world, but it's certainly going to be better than naked.<br /><br />My only real complaint would be that some of the mold lines are a little sharp out of the box, but I'm sure after real world use and handling, these will be softened over time.<br /><br />Highly recommended for the price.
B00005LC1H|4.0|It arrived really quickly, but it looks completely different from the picture.... the description appears to be the same on the box as what the seller described, but I was just surprised that the picture is not accurate.

B004N0PZNK|5.0|I have listened through these CDs 3+ times, always gleaning more. This was recommended at a recent integrative, chronic illness conference. I ordered it as soon as I got home, best buy in quite some time. Thought provoking concepts by Dr. Bruce Lipton. It is a reminder of all we don't know or truly understand. We may have great scientist however our institutions of higher learning stiffle and snuff out those whom concepts don't agree or that might be incontrast to their own. It isn't a small thing that Dr Lipton left a tenured position at a medical teaching institution.  He felt he could no longer teach Biology accurately because his research experience showed its flaws. Some people stay because the money and prestige is more important than advancing science. This is happening in medicine and our government supports those teaching institutions and their bias research.   This book is about science, it is not a novel. In my humble opinion, it is not \\"read\\" swiftly. I think the concepts have layered depth and need contemplative thought. Like a science class, study and extra learning. Listen intently and maybe a few times over. I have loved listening to this series.   Blessings, Kayleen, Nurse Practitioner in SP, Maryland
B005PR2FD8|3.0|Like the title suggests, this movie is purely for the fans. This option is also for the ones that either don't want Tekken Hybrid or have a 360 and don't really want to shell out 40 bucks for a blu-ray version of the movie. While the release has no features whatsoever, it's still a serviceable movie.  However, one of the things that really plagues the film is the English dubbing. Sure, Xiayou and Anna are pretty good, but the other voice actors either ham up their lines or phone them in, leading to many unintentionally humorous moments. The story is pretty odd, and while it does center around both Alisa and Xiayou, the whole film gets hijacked by the Mishima clan and bloodline (understandably so, since the movie is subtitled Blood Vengeance.)  The main spectacle is how pretty the film looks, even on DVD. The animation style is akin to the Final Fantasy CGI film, and is less bogged down by story. Although fans will recognize the conflicts between Jin, Heihachi, and Kazama, casuals will find something to enjoy in this movie.
B005I64U5C|4.0|First, I own the non-3D extended-version.  As with any movie, it could have been better.  The special effects were amazing, and I loved the 'making of' features on the disk.  Ryan Reynolds did a great job as Hal/Green Lantern, I must give him credit for that.  The writing of his character was a bit loose, though.  Blake Lively was excellent as Carol Ferris.

B001E45XT4|5.0|Ok I bought these with an USB sound card adaptor STRICTLY FOR MY PS3. I LOVE THESE FREAKING THINGS!! They heavy duty but light on your head, plus your ears will not be on fire from it being closed. I mostly play COD online, these things are great. So what they are corded (6.5ft) Its all yea need to game, with mic connected to PS3 and headphones to T.V. (most new t.v.'s come with headphone jacks) BAM YOU HAVE SURROUND SOUND!!!!. It's no bass booming headphone, but you can hear your enemies sneeking on you and all thats count to.. SO FOR MUSIC DONT KNOW???? BUT GAMING ON A BUDGET FREAKING AWESOME!!!!
B001E45XT4|4.0|The sound quality is very good.  The mic works very well.  However, the earpieces are not as comfortable as I was hoping they would be.  Ears tend to get sore in about an hour or so.  Moving them around/ readjusting seems to help some.  In reality I thought that earpieces so large would completely cover the ear, and they do, but still smashes and becomes sore.  I have small ears and can make these work better than alot that I have used, but for someone with larger ears- these would be a no go in the comfort category.  Everything else about them is great.  The cord is long and sturdy.  The coverings on the ears are soft.  The sound deadening is great.  If they were a bit easier on the ears I would'nt consider buying anything else.
3937406328|3.0|The idea is great - a journey through the history of blues and an attempt to recreate the feel of each style and time period. This is not an academic study, but it's Rea's interpretation. Fair enough, but the problem is that there are too many songs and Chris Rea doesn't have enough musical ideas to make each CD sound different enough from each other. Furhtermore, it sounds too Chris Rea. His signature slide playing and licks are featured throughout, his typical guitar sound too, so the experience ends up feeling like Road to Hell blues version 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. Furthermore, delta blues, for instance, just doesn't sound right with Rea's British accent. Some of the songs are also pure pop songs and do not fit at all on a blues record. He even uses cheesy electric drums on some tracks.  To make it sound more genuine, he should have copied the playing style typical for each style to a greater extent. He should have done what Ry Cooder did on his latest album, \\"Pull Up Some Dust And Sit Down\\", where he on one song mimics John Lee Hooker in singing and playing style, which works superbly well.  Granted, each CD has its great points, and I think this release could have been much better if the project had been reduced to 2 or 3 CDs with only the best songs.
0060873027|3.0|I don't need to add to the other negative reviews.  It reads like a movie script, and would probably make a better film than a book.
B0000027I6|5.0|For anyone who is a Roger Waters fan, anyone who likes music, and anyone who is passionate about their sound quality (or at least cares about the quality of their music, or appreciates a good recording) this is a standard. It remains my go-to CD when I want to test the sound stage of any stereo. It may well be the best sounding red book CD in certain respects... The soundstage on the first piece is eerie, and it's a lot of fun to see your friends turning around and looking for the dog behind them or way to the side - yes, on a two channel stereo!!  The music is elaborate, full of angst, layer upon layer of complexities. It gets a bit heavy and much as you listen to the whole CD, as the pieces are all arranged to make a complete statement when heard as an entire record, not just bits and pieces, although some of them sound very good on their own.  The lyrics are another phenomenal side to this great artist - very good poetry, although the insistence on the message can at times get tiring.  Overall, this is a record that is a must own for anyone who claims to have a CD \\"collection\\". There are a handful of records that qualify for that position across genres, and this is one of them. If you don't have it, get it!
B00138KD5A|5.0|Nice, low key Christmas music. No big orchestra, no overproduction. I'm not even really a James Taylor fan, but I love it. I needed a change of pace from instrumental music, but didn't want to listen to big pop tunes or vocalists belting things out. This was perfect.    Unlike the last reviewer, I thought some of the tracks were vintage James Taylor, especially \\"River\\" and \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\\".    I thought \\"Baby It's Cold Outside\\" was a little bit annoying, but definitely not enough to skip the rest of the CD.   Overall a very nice change of pace from worn out standards.
0439813786|5.0|This book is amazing!  My son and I enjoyed reading it together.  The book is very graphic and the illustrations are beautiful.  My son's class read this book for an assignment and loved it so much I had to get it for our library at home.
B005CMSDKA|5.0|The beauty of this film is subtle; not only is the camerawork and lighting masterful from the opening scene, but also in the action. Erica Bana has a sequence entirely shot in one take, and not only is it a delicious adrenaline boost, but it has a vintage quality that simply cannot be found in today's A.D.D.-driven close-up-only action scene. There's something a European film does that American films cannot do; American flicks provide a temporary high, which only leave you thirsting for more to no avail----this film gives you satisfaction, knowing that you have witnessed a piece of art....a graphic, intense, quirky, and, most importantly, lovable masterpiece.  It is not only the director who contributes to the quality; the actors give stellar performances. Cate Blanchett's villianous role in this film beats her \\"Indiana Jones: Crystal Skull\\" one out of the water. Eric Bana plays the seemingly cold, but deeply noble Teutonic German role like he's not even acting, but like Jet Li or Jackie Chan, execute an art that is truly a part of real life. Lastly, Saoirse Ronan pioneers a role (at least I have) never seen before; untainted innocence meets Valkyrie-esque fierceness. Definitely a role all females (and males, for the sake of choosing their future bride) must witness.:)  Glass ceiling? How about penetrating the depth of the kosmos?
B002HFWAWW|4.0|Could never find this movie anywhere. I used to see it on cable and kept looking in netflix and blockbuster none had it. Strange but very good action movie love the fights and the gunkata.
0861714911|5.0|The Pali Canon is the definitive guide and words of the true Buddha. The teachings in this book go back 2600 years ago and are truly a masterpiece! If you are new to Buddhism then this book if wonderful to add to your collection. Even though there are many different schools of Buddhism...ie...zen, Tibetan.....this book has no certain way of being other then the true words of the Buddha. I would recommend this book to a learned sage as well as a beginner....
B00000IQW5|4.0|This move could be described by any number of negatives, including the incredible fact that it is a Steven Spielberg film?  That said, those people are not the target audience for this wonderful sleeper movie starring three incredible talents in Dreyfuss, Goodman and Hunter.  Few movies can so easily move you from sadness to laughter and back so seamlessly, all the time rooting for a happy ending for all the characters.  Even if one is dead.  ALWAYS ranks right up at the top with other 'feel good' movies like Sleepless in Seattle.
B005TQAI6G|1.0|It's sad to know that persons like this who doesn't have a voice at all and can't move obtain such honored award like Michael Jackson VMA...  She's absolutely useless...   How she dare to treat her fans like that - with no voice, no moves and no attitude?!  Such a shame!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I love the ad- free version and wish they would come out with more levels more often.  It's nice to not have ads getting in my way while playing.
B0017ZM3S4|5.0|(possible spoiler)  First, I apologize for my English, since it's my third language and I'm not proficient in it.  I've read a lot of books about Burma and North Korea recently and I am often terrified by the brute reality in these countries. Before this book it was the very highly rated book [[ASIN:0385523912 Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea]] by Barbara Demick that i read which provided detailed descriptions about this hidden country and true insights of North Koreans. I like that book. But I love this book better. I cried when I read about the part of the boy killed by his so call \\"instructor\\" in Yodok concentration camp. It was truly hell on earth! Even most of North Koreans do not have any human rights under the fatherly love of \\"dear Leader\\", prisoners in Yodok are not even considered human. In Yodok, adults are given the right to torture naive and unharmful children, and it's okay to kill them too. Why they did that, and how could they do such cruel acts - because they are naturally cruel, stupid, have low self esteem or they are brainwashed, or were ordered to do so - i will never know. But the world should know about this so these crimes would be stopped. This is the 21st century and yet such regime is still existing in our world, in this planet. Thank you Mr Kang for telling us your story and I truly hope the day you reunite with your family is not too far away.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Game begins with a tutorial that is helpful, even if you already know how to play Mahjong. The tutorial familiarizes you with the interface of this particular version of the game and introduces you to the &quot;Quest&quot; portion of the game. ( optional) .  Appealing graphics. Works beautifully on my Kindle Fire.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I'm in LOVE with this book!  I bought it on my kindle thinking it was just going to be another ho-hum book for 2.99, but boy was i wrong!  I've read over 200 books just this year (no, i do not watch tv-i only read) and this one has my heart! If i like a book I'll read it at least twice, but i'm on my forth go around with the Abby/Travis showdown! I love these characters and though i'm not one for curse words or even sex scenes, this book would have been lacking without them! though the sex scenes are not raunchy and overly detailed which is a plus. Travis is my \\"it\\" man right now, much to my husband's dismay! I hope this author puts more out there, I loved her prose and character development and her acknowledgement that not all love stories are perfect.
B005K17RU0|5.0|it works ok when its on wifi, setting up was a minor pain but after zipcode and such,all the needed info came out fine.
0425241505|4.0|I really enjoyed this book the first time and would have rated it at a solid 4 stars, but I just finished reading it again and it has climbed up to 4.5 stars. Maybe by the third time it will be 5 ;)  I love characters that make no excuses or apologies about who they are and what they want - denial is so very unattractive. I also love dragons - so this was a win-win for me. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves alpha men and fantasy/paranormal romance.
1439192812|5.0|This book embodies the very nature of why Richard Dawkins is currently my favorite author. It's informative, it's clear-cut, it's intelligent, and it drips with logic and with reason. I consider myself very well-versed in the many topics that are covered in this book (astronomy, physics, biology - to name a few), but there have been several times so far (I'm not yet done reading it) when I've had \\"So THAT'S how that works!\\" moments. Do you live in the country and often see what appears to be a long, faint cloud in the sky overhead, but you're not sure if it might also be a long cluster of stars? The book explains that. Do you wonder what evidence we have for the Big Bang? The book explains that as well.  And, it does so in such a way that adults and children can both enjoy and learn something from it. This book is not like Dawkins' other works such as \\"The God Delusion\\" or \\"The Greatest Show On Earth\\", which were all very technical and informationally complex books. Rather, this book is very clear and simple in how it presents it's points. Which, in all honesty, I found to be a nice break from my usual intake of scientifically and grammatically complicated books. As I read, I feel as though I could very-well be reading this to my child one day as a bedtime story (I wish I had this book when I was a kid). However, do not let that put you off (as it almost did to me), because even though the book is readable by a younger audience, it is also very profound, informational and in-depth.  Now, I feel that I should avoid the slight urge to be sneaky, and instead be honest to those who may be concerned. The book does talk about Evolution; it does explain the topic in-depth, and it also ranks many major religious ideologies on the same mythological level as any other historical fairy-tale. Keep in mind, though, that this is not a book that bashes religion. Dawkins himself has stated that he has said what he needed to say about religion with \\"The God Delusion\\" and that this book will not try to push any anti-religious agenda. As a result, the book simply lists religious ideas casually among the rest of the world's mythologies - not paying it any special attention; not pushing it into the shadows. The only direct conflict the book has with religious teachings is when it comes to the topic of Evolution.  However, it is my personal feeling that children - being that they are more or less the target audience - should be informed of the wonderous scientific progress that has been made in regard to biology. If you are a religious parent, it is of course your decision what you want your child to be exposed to in regard to facts. But please keep in mind that this book does not attempt to undermine whatever religious ideologies you may be instilling in your children. Rather, it simply presents evidence. It presents what we - as a collective society - know about the biology of living things, as well as the nature of the Universe itself. The book encourages us to be honest with ourselves and with our world. If you are sheltering your children from that, then you are not only being dishonest with them, but you are doing them a disservice in doing so. Not only because you're not clarifying the very idea of Evolution (to either be accepted or rejected), but because if that alone keeps you from purchasing this book, you're also keeping them from the many other wonderful bits of information that are contained within it's pages.   But again, parents should do as they wish with their own children. For me personally, though, I am very grateful for this book and the incredible information it has to offer. It is a fascinating read.
B001IXXYBA|5.0|I was very pleased with this movie.  I have always loved it and wanted to watch it again and watched it together with my children.  We all enjoyed watching it together.  I love Patrick Swayze and was devastated when he passed away. I wanted to get this movie for a long time and was unable to find it in any stores, which made me try Amazon.  It worked!!  I received it very quickly and it was a great price.  It came in perfect condition and as advertised. Thanks.
B005K17RU0|4.0|i like it..a handy app to check weather every morning..easy setup and easy to use.. check out it is cool
B000JML90Y|5.0|Most \\"christians\\" haven\\"t actually read the bible...if the y had, they would be atheists.  This is probably the most important book that has been written since humans stopped herding sheep in the middle East 1500 years ago.
B0063IH60K|4.0|this game is pretty solid for an app. I wish that some parts of it had a bit more explanation like the different types of deals, but otherwise not bad....
B004TTMYQG|1.0|I bought this for my Kindle Fire and this is what tech support wrote to me after I could not get it to work.   \\"The problem with the Kindle Fire is not because of our app but of the Android OS version of the Kindle Fire. The developers from this tablet didn't implement a calendar database, nor a sync-feautre nor a local calendar. Our calendar needs at least a calendar one of these to work properly! So maybe Amazon will update the Android OS version of the tablet in the future.\\"  Do not purchase for Kindle Fire or you will be HIGHLY disappointed.  Giving a 1 star because Amazon labeled as being compatable with the Fire and it is not.
B00138KEZ4|5.0|Sweet, so sweet. What a voice this woman has and it's put to incredibly good use on these songs. I listen to this album over and over. If I had to pick only one Christmas album for the rest of my life - this would be it. No, not necessarily upbeat and \\"hot\\", so it depends on what you like. If you like languid music that wraps itself around you and is comforting and inspirational, then go with this.
0385474547|5.0|When two opposing forces collide, one must fall, disappearing into obscurity. For most of the early 20th century, the colonization of Nigeria was portrayed as a necessary reformation of the unusually cruel, antiquated traditions of the Ibo people. But Nigerian writers like Chinua Achebe, upon obtaining mastery of the English language, spoke out against the narrow perspective of history cast by the oppressors.     Things Fall Apart is an accessible piece of African literature considering the gravity of its content. The simple yet elevated diction reflects Achebe's authentic cultural voice. He calmly weaves examples of camaraderie and local justice between the more often discussed primitive aspects of the village culture. The glossary of Ibo terms in the back of book enables the author to create a convincing atmosphere that immerses the reader into African village life.     As an antithesis to 20th century colonial literature, the book succeeds. Though sexism, infanticide, and a unjust class system persist, the Ibo culture redeems itself by displaying its ability to unify and bring together entire villages to celebrate life.     Through the prosperous yam farmer and storied wrestler Okonkwo, Achebe introduces us to the story's tragic hero. Scorning his father's feminine traits, he works hard to win the village's approval. At the peak of his success, he joins the council of village spirits, guiding the actions of his village. However, by the story's end, he finds himself utterly alone, deserted by those who are unwilling to defend the values and customs of the village.   There are two sides to every coin, and Achebe shows that on both the human and village levels. One can support Okonkwo's determination to become the highest ranked man in his village and at the same time feel disappointed when he blatantly disobeys tradition or displays unnecessary coldness. We mourn the destruction of village culture and Okwonko, despite all their faults, because we can see the vitality and goodness in them. This, of course, is due to the unique perspective Achebe lends us through his masterpiece.
B004SEVPWQ|5.0|I love this pool game and I bet you will too. I tried the demo and after 10 games I bought the Pro version. Great graphics, realistic physics (...but I'm not a real world pool player...so at least it seems realistic to *me*), low price. Runs great on my Kindle fire with mesh set to very high. Def try it if you're looking for a fun pool game.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|everybody told me this wasnt the best movie to see and i watched it on netflix and bought it that same night, i loved it
B004SBX112|1.0|It would be nice if it actually downloaded. Can I get my money back? It's stuck at 0%. I have had nothing but problems from the amazon market place. Maybe they should stick to the pc only.
B004QZ9PLU|2.0|I don't think Mr. Sparks is a bad writer but his books are starting to seem like they contain recycled content or unoriginal ideas. This book is probably my least favorite Sparks book. I miss his earlier books. And no one seems to be happy in any of his books. I hate that I paid $12.99 for this. Wish I would have waited for the free library copy. Skip this one. I really don't want to read his next book but I'm sure I'll get sucked into reading it anyway.
B004LROUW2|5.0|This is a novel with two love stories.  [Love Story 1] : Girl & Boy   - Fantastic 944 page LONG love story.  \\"In love making, length matters.\\"  [Love Story 2] : Haruki & Literature  - Haruki seems to have so much love with Literature! I don't think Haruki much cares about the reader. He is too busy making love with 'Literature'. Proust, Orwell, Tolstoy, Chekov are just the tip of a LONG LIST of his Lovers. I can sense Haruki's readings and writings and structuring and analyzing and countering and juxtaposing and layering and copying and twisting and mystifying and demystifying and coloring and deconstructing and reconstructing and translating and transposing and cutting and pasting and mixing and mashing and chancing and contesting and historisizing and contextualizing and physicalizing and metaphysical playing and and and.   - It is not without reason that Haruki keeps in physical shape with running. (He has to be in tip top shape to have so many lovers!)  \\"If I could be one person in this world, I would be Haruki. Because Haruki gets fame and fortune for making love with Literature.\\"
0545123267|5.0|My daughter (16 yrs old) and I are avid readers and she came across this series herself. She read all 3 (Shiver, Linger, and Forever) and kept talking about the books and the characters. I decided to read them myself because I wanted to understand her excitement and possibly have something to talk about rather than me asking if chores were done and inquiring about school. I was amazed at how much I liked these books. The story line is so different and the books are so well written to the point where I was able to imagine that entire world in such detail. To be honest, I couldn't put the books down. I loved how my daughter would ask me where I was in the story and it would launch a lengthy discussion. It was as if we formed our own little book club!   I loved these books and the experience so much that I just ordered 2 copies of Maggie Stiefvater  recent book \\"The Scorpio Races\\" so we can do it all over again :)
0307477479|2.0|Rarely does a book fall so far from its first impression. Immersed in the psychological tangles of Sasha and her kleptomania, I subsequently grew disappointed, restless, bored, then outright annoyed as the book went on its meandering way through a slew of irritatingly trivial, vapid characters who, while offering glimmers of real souls, are never allowed to really speak their piece before Egan skips off to the next, and what she does give them to speak is seldom enlightening or even entertaining. I cannot improve on the phrase \\"forced quirkiness\\", already employed by several reviewers here, in describing the feel of this book and its cast.   Egan's prose is milky-smooth, but wasted here. It is the only thing imbuing the characters with any humanity, yet they never transcend the page. They never feel three-dimensional but are rather stuck in a very self-conscious, writer-corralled world. They feel as parodies of the characters one might find in an independent student film, and I'm not going to deny that the focus on the music industry, already a yawn for me, and the inclusion of a punk band called the \\"Flaming Dildos\\", yet a bigger yawn, informed that impression. In reading, I asked myself continuously: Do these feel like real people? Do these feel like people I know? Do these feel like people I'd want to know? What are these people telling me about myself? I came up with very little.   The postmodern techniques Egan uses, such as a chapter done as a Power-Point presentation, are just that: transparently postmodern techniques. They are not innovative, or even very effective, eliciting maybe a smile and nod for the gimmick but quickly overstaying their welcome. In the novel \\"House of Leaves\\", the unique and ergodic typography, while still a gimmick, nonetheless has an understood reason for being. In Joyce's \\"The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\", the text grows as Stephen Daedulus grows, evolving from near-incoherent child-babble to richly-packed prose, thus allowing us to follow and appreciate his transformation.   As mentioned prior, my frustration is likely exaggerated by dashed expectations, which were dashed harsh and dashed far. Probably what also didn't help matters was that alongside \\"Goon Squad\\" I also read Faulkner's \\"As I Lay Dying\\" and several novellas by H.P. Lovecraft. In the cosmic, sanity-buckling grandeur of those authors and their concerns, the concerns of Egan's whiny, wistful, impotent characters were ground into granules.  Perhaps the scene best capturing the spirit of \\"Goon Squad\\" is when it describes the extraordinary phenomenon of nonlocal communication between separated photons, all in the context of people recognizing a Lindsey Lohan-type at a local restaurant. One can say it was trying to be witty, clever, quirky, but in the end, to me, it was just empty.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Finally, a new, interesting, captivating, and impossible to put down story! From beginning to end it is brilliant! There is not another book like this! I read at least a book a week, and have been getting bored with the same ole stuff over and over. Until I read this. What a relief! The depth, humor, heartache, action, romance, death, life, choices, thoughts, feelings, characters, writing...it is so real. While reading, I felt as if I was there the whole time. The ending could not have been better. If any series could equal or surpass the Twilight saga, this is it. Love it!
B004LV287M|5.0|+  CD sounds great, bonus 2 instrumental and 2 live recordings is a valuable addition.   This is my only CD of ZAZ, so can't compare to other editions.  Sorry, haven't play DVD yet, but according to booklet there is no my favorite 'La Fee' video  there...  -  Unfortunately, songs in a booklet are translated from French to German, not English.
1435122968|5.0|Over the years I have spent at least 10X the price of this beautiful volume on paperbacks with 2 or 3 Lovecraft stories & lots of \\"filler\\" written by others. Now I have his complete fiction in one really nice book that looks & feels like it should last a lifetime (and it even has a \\"built-in\\" ribbon bookmark).
B005TPCQ5I|2.0|Again, here is the classic case of the book turned into movie, and the movie just fails.  There are alot of missing details in this movie that make the flow of the time line suffer. Its unfortunate because the few intimate glimpses between the main characters (Emma and Dex) are best represented here, and there isn't enough of it to really let the viewer know what kind of on again off again relationship they truly had. They loved each other the whole time. It barely touches on Dex's alcoholism and leaves alot for the viewer to interpret. Had I not read the book, I would not have made the connection because again it was choppy. It is clear that the time frame and the choppy time line wasn't translated well in this film and nothing could save it. The actors did their best, but who ever wrote the screen play couldn't pull together the loose ends that this fabulous book weaved together as a modern romance between jilted and lost lovers that kept slipping by each other in time. Skip the movie, read the book. I give this movie 2 stars for Sturgess and Hathaway and the lovely eye gazing that barley expresses what the book has to offer.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I just got this Marware cover for my Fire, because I didn't want anything bulky.  The Fire fits inside like a glove, no straps on the corners or anything.  The inside front cover is velvety soft to protect the screen.  It folds flat in back or bends into a stand, so we can prop it up in landscape position.  There is an elastic strap that goes around to hold down the front cover.<br /><br />The cover leaves the speakers, power button, USB port exposed, so we don't have to take the Fire out for any reason.  It looks great.  I'm happy with my purchase.

1451648537|5.0|You'll find a dozen good books on Steve Jobs, but this is definitely the one to start with. The book is roughly equally split into all stages of Steve Jobs' life: from early childhood, to college, founding of Apple, a brief stint at Next, his return to Apple, his involvement with Pixar, and finally his battle with cancer. Importantly, this book is about Steve, not Apple, or Next, or Pixar - a few readers have criticized the book for not going deep enough on some of these topics, but that's not the point.<br /><br />You will definitely get a glimpse into the history and the individuals behind Apple, Pixar, and Next, but if you are interested in a full(er) narrative behind each, make sure to pick up a few other books as well. Both \\"iWoz\\" by Steve Wozniack and \\"The Pixar Touch\\" by David Price are both great reads and offer \\"the other side\\". After all, Steve was known for his \\"distortion field\\" for a reason!<br /><br />\\"Oh, and one more thing\\"... Head on over to PBS to view their (free) one hour documentary on Steve Jobs, just search for \\"PBS Steve Jobs - One Last Thing\\" - it's a perfect companion to this book.
B005KELQEU|5.0|First off, before buying something to protect your Kindle you must decide if you are a Sleeve person or a Cover person. A cover stays on your kindle while you read, like a book cover, while a sleeve is designed to simply protect it from dust and scratches when not using. Since the new $79 and $99 (Touch) Kindles are extremely light, especially the $79 model which I use, you might, like me, find it is much nicer to use `naked' since it is so light and effortless to hold. For me adding a cover while reading detracts from the ultra-light feel by weighing it down (a little). This is all personal preference so play with your Kindle for a bit before buying protection for it. I mention this since there are several reviews, for all sleeves, that complain this is not a cover - exactly, it's a SLEEVE.  Regarding this design. It is exactly what I wanted; a small, light and relatively inexpensive (most go for $25 or $30 making this the best value) sleeve to keep my kindle between using to protect it from getting dusty or scratched. As for fit, I am am using the $79 Kindle which is slightly lighter, and more importantly, slightly smaller in every dimension than the Touch - which is 0.3\\" taller and 0.2\\" wider. Anyway, mine fits great with a slight amount of wiggle room so I would expect the Touch model to fit a pinch more snugly due to the slight size difference (but I have not tried one). There are a few reviews that comment that it it too small or too tight. I can only say that it would be too small if you tried to fit the Kindle Keyboard model (much longer) or too tight if you did not remove the white insert. If you left the insert, which it ships with inside to hold its shape, then yeah, it will be too tight. Take it out.  One last thing, it seems that Belkin customer service has responded to many of these reviews. They should be commended for actually listening to customer feedback, something you would expect from a good company always trying to make a better product. Highlyreommended!!!  Lastly, I also purchased the [[ASIN:B003FZA1OW Verso Clip-On Reading Light for Kindle (Graphite)]] which is another value. Small, light, inexpensive and provides great coverage without glare problems. Also, highly recommended.  Edited to add: Yesterday, Dec 30, 2011, I dropped my Kindle with sleeve about 4 feet onto the hard pavement of a parking lot - no damage at all. So the sleeve seems to be adequate protection for that type of fall - plus the ultra light weight helps as well since a heavier item may or may not have been damaged
B0063IH60K|4.0|works really well and good graphics. fun to play and easy to use for all ages. would recomend to anyone
B003E6K1VK|5.0|I purchased this after much consideration and being new to the world of audiophile, the price of the FiiO E7 was the deciding factor in sealing the deal. The package was nice and effective: a box with all the goodies inside. I liked that it came with a cloth cover for the E7, as well as a rubber outer lining to keep the edges of the E7 from getting all scuffed up. As for the actual sound quality, using it as a DAC from my Macbook Pro and hooking a pair of AKG K240 (and later a pair of K241's and Sennheiser HD380) I was really pleased with the outcome. The most noticeable difference when using the E7 with some decent headphones and FLAC audio is that the music is...more there, with more presence. It's not necessarily louder, though it can be, it's just fuller.   I know that listening to music through the E7 fatigues my ears less than it does coming straight out of the laptop, probably because I don't have to blast the music as loud to hear details in songs...it's been reviewed and raved at long enough, I've added my two cents. The E7 works. It was under $100. Awesome.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Enjoyed playing it. The graphics make it entertaining and it keeps your attention.  The changing backgrounds keep it from getting boring.
B0043URV5U|5.0|This is a great set!.  One of the best remastering jobs I have heard.  Seger has never sounded so good.  How can anybody complain about this set.  For less than ten dollars you can own some of the greatest rock n roll songs of all time.

B0015DYIH2|5.0|Yes this book has some misspelled words and improper grammar but it was amazing. There are no words to discribe this book and how amazing it is. This should be on everybodys kindle. Dont let yourself down Stephenie, those other people dont know wgat there alking about. They are nuts. You did amazing and I wish you will write an other book after Breaking Dawn. Thanks for making this day the best.
1451627289|4.0|I've read nearly everything Stephen King has written. When he's off his game, it's hard going. But when he's on, few can touch him. This one falls in the latter category. 11/22/63 is his best effort since Hearts in Atlantis and overall is a terrific read. I literally couldn't put it down. Oddly, King is actually better when he's not writing in the horror genre for which he is so well known. The only complaints I have are length -- brevity has never been one of King's strengths -- and the inclusion of the Yellow Card Man, an unnecessary deus ex machina. Surely Jake Epping could have figured out the impact of his actions for himself once he returned to 2011.
1466208686|5.0|This book is an excellent resource to prepare you for technical interviews. It covers common interview questions that will help you tackle many different variations of well-known technical problems during a real interview. After working through the problems and solutions in the book, I was able to secure offers from multiple tech companies. The fifth edition is a substantial upgrade from the forth edition, and I highly recommend getting this book if you are serious about getting a good job!
0670022705|3.0|Very good in general, but the pictures should be better. In all cases the background is flat black, which is dull and lowers the contrast when the object is also dark or is illuminated with insufficient light, as some are. In some cases, there are better pictures in the web site. Also, the dimensions of each object should appear in the picture.
B0018LX9T4|5.0|This is an amazing movie. A friend of mine in the lifestyle gifted it to me, and I fell in love with it in the first viewing. I've seen it several times since, and could watch it several times more. I'm what they classify as \\"vanilla\\", and this movie really struck a chord in me. But even if you're not in or interested in the lifestyle, this a sweet love story. Sure, its slightly twisted, but isn't life?

0385534639|5.0|Prospero the Enchanter, a mysterious magic performer finds his five-year old daughter returned to him by his wife. Her suicide note was pinned to the little girl's coat. Prospero, whose real name was Hector Bowen, trained his daughter Celia in the art of magic. It turned out that Prospero, and later Celia, were stunning audiences whenever they performed because they were really able to do magic. Prospero, however, had an ancient nemesis, the enigmatic man called Alexander but usually referred to as \\"the man in the grey suit\\" or \\"A_H\\". Prospero and A_H made a wager in which the terms were not made known to the reader, but it involved a challenge in which Prospero pitched his daughter against A_H's protégé, Marco. Marco was picked from an orphanage. Neither Celia nor Marco knew who their opponent was until much later in the story although both were sent by their mentors to work for Chandresh Lefevre's circus.   This circus was the stage in which the duel was to take place and in which there would be found a cast of characters that became integral to the story. They included Tsukiko the contortionist, the flame-haired Murray twins know as Widget and Poppet, Bailey, a boy who fell in love with poppet and together with Widget was to become an important figure in the tale. Before things became difficult for the proxies Celia and Marco, Isobel a card reader and Friedrich Thiessen who made the grand magical clock for the circus entwined their lives into that of Marco and Celia respectively.  Why would such a tale be captivating? That is because all the major characters have real magic. That was why the audiences were always enraptured. It is also because Morgenstern is a marvelous story teller who creates intensely wonderful characters and let them take the reader through a world of magic during which time he forgets that there is no such thing as magic. Why did the duel have to take place? What will become of all the posturing that goes on, wittingly and unwittingly? Theanswer lies in the Latin phrase \\"esse quam videri\\" (to be rather than to seem) and because love is the true magic.

B001IF252M|5.0|This Apple device worked perfectly in order to connect my MacBook Pro with my SonicView projector.  Even better, a friends who owns an HP Envy 14 tried it and it works perfectly with his computer.  This type of information is difficult to find.  HP website indicates it probably would not work.  Nice to now an Apple VGA adapter works with perfectly with an HP Envy 14.
1451627289|5.0|I have been a long-time fan of Stephen King - so long, in fact, that I can't remember the first book of his that I read.  With the exception of the Dark Tower books, as I'm not a fantasy fan, I have read everything he's written - long novels, short novels, short stories, e-novellas.  My Kindle tells me that I am 50% through 11/22/63 - I have devoured every word.  Even though this book is not a typical Stephen King horror novel, the suspense is delightfully maddening - I just keep reading and reading and reading.  Connecting the story in 11/22/63 to characters from past stories was a genius move on his part.  Believe it or not, I think Stephen King is now entering his prime - he is once again (in my opinion, anyway) one of the most brilliant writers of our time.  I'm only halfway through this book and I'm already looking forward to his next one.
1423113454|4.0|Riordan does it again with old mythology coming into present day. Think Percy Jackson with a sister and egyptian mythology instead of greek and you get the idea for this book. I don't want to give away any details but its a great read and I would highly recommend this to any who enjoy Riordan's other books.

B0029QRA1U|5.0|This product was better than described.  I have used it to convert all of my old records into MP3's. The player and the software it comes with are very user friendly and have great instructions. I would definitely recommend this product.
B000002KHB|5.0|When this album was released, hard rock was just hitting it's stride, I was just coming of age, a few pirate radio stations remained, it was a great time to be young. Listening to any music of this era today, the lyrics are naive and recordings are crude. Understand that rock bands didn't get decent treatment from studios back then, but hell, what did it matter? We were listening to our music on an Automatic Radio 8-Track player with \\"Mind Blower\\" amplified speakers rated at 10% THD. This album exemplifies the heartbeat and emotion of the day, picture a smoky biker bar with sawdust floors. If you weren't of that era, you may not appreciate the crudeness was an intentional part of that landscape. Listen, learn, enjoy.
0321704452|4.0|The Naked Presenter was a very informative and easy read. I really enjoyed this book because of his approach towards his audience. I admired how he highlighted different topics using Zen concepts. In this book he discusses how we can apply the spirit of yearning for naturalness to our professional lives as well. This book was very influential for me because I tend to get nervous during presentations instead of stripping away all the unnecessary and just embrace simplicity. Reading this book I learned that it is very imperative that the person you really are should appear during your presentation. It shows sincerity, confidence, and that you are managing your fear. Reynolds did an amazing job with his approach and I will definitely incorporate his techniques for future presentations.
B004ZNB12O|4.0|What? No \\"Echoes?\\" No 'Best of...\\" without \\"Echoes\\" is not acceptable! How could they possibly leave that one out? What were they thinking? Amazing.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Yes, this may be considered a no frills box set, but I don't care!  Since I never bought any of the individual movies on DVD, this was the most economical way to own all 8 parts.  I liked the way the disks were packaged in one case.  The minimalist packaging makes for easy access to the disks & doesn't take up any more space then 2 DVD cases.  All 8 disks played great.  There were no playback issues.  Parts 7 & 8 did contain deleted scenes.  Otherwise each disk is one movie & some theater trailers.  After seeing all the low ratings I thought there were quality issues, but this is not the case.  The bad reviews seem to focus on the lack of special features & the UK having a better Blu-ray box set.  It just seems some people won't be happy no matter what box set WB puts out.  Overall, if you are looking for all 8 Harry Potter films, this is a great deal!  This set was about $40 dollars when I purchased it.  The price has gone up in the last week.  It may be cheaper to buy individually now.

B00021R7CG|4.0|This is a must see movie. For an HBO production, it could as well have competed with most of the fare in the theaters at the time. Magnificent performances by Martin Landau and James Earl Jones. The plot and setup are well done. Nicely done personal angles between De Mornay and Boothe.  As a government employee with some knowledge of how things work in these doomsday scenarios, I suspect the movie is not even dated as regards what technology and \\"what ifs\\" matter as the plot moves along. The realism is fascinating and frightening at the same time.   This goes in the gotta see category.
B0044RUSZM|4.0|I love this stand. I previously purchased the TwevleSouth BookArc which is cool but it got extremely annoying and inconvenient when I went to turn on my MacBook, so I bought this.<br /><br />This takes more room than the gorgeous TwevleSouth BookArc but is more practical and functional in my opinion. Sleek and clean design makes it even better. I paid $49 so which is crazy over priced so I'm going to give it only 4 stars. I see now that the price has dropped to $29 which is a good deal. Definitely worth the cost.
0316056863|3.0|I ordered Bossypants through Amazon so it would be $10 in hardcover. I'm glad I didn't spend more for such a short, easy read. Not as witty and smart as I'd hoped for considering Fey is known as a talented writer. I enjoy 30 Rock, but I've learned to expect little from memoirs by high-profile female comedians. I didn't think Kathy Griffin or Chelsea Handler's were good at all. Bossypants seems half-assed and either ghostwritten or lazily written by someone who can do better (but why bother when she's so busy with 30 Rock and will make lotsa money off book sales either way?) I basically read the book to avoid denser material and only read the whole thing because it was over before it started. I think pretty highly of Tina Fey, but this seems like some half-baked effort she barely exerted herself on. It seems like female comedians just churn out these sub-par memoirs because women buy more books than men and are hungry for memoirs by other females. It's not like Fey is trying to write a game-changing book people will refer to several decades from now, it's just to make a quick buck off an easily sold target demo.
0061091480|4.0|This book was extremely helpful in understanding GUILT and WORRY as unnecessary \\"erroneous\\" emotions.  However, the ideas were a bit extreme (I guess I tend to still lean on the more \\"dependent\\" side of the spectrum) for my tastes.  The book is outdated, I believe originally published in 1976, but the themes are still mostly applicable for today's times.  Overall, I am not disappointed and have already loaned the book out to a friend.

Just about every song on the album has something to offer. hot dance beats, i dont know if \\"great vocals\\" can describe any modern song by britney but it was just really enjoyable and the bonus songs really are a bonus cuz they are just great. i been listening to this album since it came out and i still dont get tired of it. It might be the best album of 2011.

B006HDLEY0|5.0|Usually Supernatural takes Sam and Dean (or their father in the early seasons) and viewers on an emotional roller coaster. In this episode, we get more back story on Bobby Singer as Jim Beaver gives a stellar performance. In a coma and running from a Reaper with his former partner Rufus in tow to help him navigate his memories, we learn about young Bobby's life and how it impacted his choices in his adult life. By the end of the episode we do not know if he lives or dies, but we know that the best memories in life are in the small little things we enjoy every day.
B002SSUQFG|3.0|I've had this watch for about three weeks, and find only one significant flaw -- the complaints that it doesn't retain enough energy to keep going when not worn, or even when worn but not subject to regular movement are valid.  Depending on your circumstances, this may be a trivial point or a significant drawback. My recommendation is that this be purchased as a weekend watch, a good choice for casual style, but not to be confused with a true field watch.<br /><br />The watch is good looking, solidly made, evidently inspired by the military watches that were common during and after World War II. In the United States, military watches were largely made by Hamilton, although other watchmakers were also busy with similar designs.  The watches were durable stem winders, with a focus on durability rather than accuracy.  In most instances, the face was white, and the second hand was separate rather than a sweep second hand.  There was no day or date function.  This watch is a reminder of that style, but considerably larger, with day and date, an automatic movement which cannot be wound by the stem, sweep second hand, and a clear back.  While it has much of the simple functionality of the military design, it is not a reproduction of the classic style of the 1940s.<br /><br />My experience with the accuracy has been favorable, although I have not tested it as rigorously as other reviewers have.  I've set it to the time on my cable television box, which doesn't offer seconds, After 3 days without resettine the watch was no more than 1 minute off.  I have not tried to monitor it for a longer period.<br /><br />The strap is nylon with leather or leatherette reinforcement, and appears to be durable.  The look seem appropriate for the style of the watch.<br /><br />The one flaw I've found is that the watch does not retain enough energy to get through a full night without running down.  On those occasions when I was able to measure its accuracy after three days, I had a series of awakenings and did not sleep for more than 4 hours at a stretch.  On those occasions, having read the other reviews, I shook the watch to build up an energy reserve.  On nights when I was not disturbed, I found that the watch had run down by morning.<br /><br />The extent of the annoyance this imposes is subjective.  Automatic winders are widely marketed which will shake watches to keep the automatic movement wound, but these devices are more expensive than this wristwatch  and seem like overkill.  Since the day and date are quite easy to set, and accurate time sources are readily available, this may seem trivial.  Older readers may recall making a telephone call to get the correct time, but today, with computers synchronized to highly accurate clocks, as well as clocks on cable boxes and cellular telephones, there's no difficulty finding a reference source to reset a wristwatch.  Those who have several watches and may want to change over as a matter of style will find this flaw perfectly acceptable -- but for those people who want an automatic wristwatch as an alternative to battery powered watches, this may be a fatal flaw. Better automatic watches will hasve enough reserve power after a day of wear to run for 36 - 48 hours without movement.<br /><br />SUMMARY -- this is a good example of style over substance.  Accepted for what it is, a good watch to wear with faded jeans to go pumpkin picking in the autumn or browsing antique stores in the spring, it's an excellent value.  It is not a rugged field watch for hunters nor is it a luxury timepiece at a bargain price.  Enjoy it for what it is.han 4 hours at a stretch.

B0040HJNKC|5.0|After a run of bad to awful albums and lackluster, sloppy performances I have to say that Buddy Guy is back stronger than ever.  What a great surprise!  And right now, live, he is better than just about anyone.  I've seen him probably a dozen times dating back to the late 80's and I've seen the good and the awful.  This album and the way he is playing now... wow.  He is like a man reborn.  I can't believe that at this age he has the energy and freshness that he is bringing.  Get the album but for sure see him live right now!
B0026PMN70|5.0|If you like great bluesy vocals backed by a tight band with horn arrangments reminiscent of the James Brown band, then you'll definitely want this album. Lee delivers with powerful vocals of days gone by. He actually sounds like james, (albeit words are distinguishable)but in his own style. The Expressions band are a main attraction on there own, with tight horn arrangement accompanied by changing guitar licks and a driving bass line (don't know who the bass player is, but he's good.........real good. You won't be dissappointed.

B005HV6Y5W|4.0|There is very little dialogue in this impressionistic mosaic of metaphysical/ apocalyptic fragments, which are combined with a disturbing portrayal of family dissension in 1950's. I know that the above description sounds pretty terrible, but it's actually enjoyable if you have the time and patience to sit back and take it all in.  I waited a long time for this film to come out on DVD and I wasn't disappointed. But don't buy or rent it if you're looking for a traditional story with a firm linear plot, a logical sequence and easy-to-understand concepts.  It's more like undergoing an artistic/philospohical experience as opposed to watching and absorbing a storyline. My only complaint is that the little bit of dialogue that exists, is spoken primarily in whispers.  So be prepared to keep the volume turned up and the subtitles turned on.
B004QITJC2|5.0|FINALLY after all these years, the album arrives & it does not disappoint at all.  Their charismatic front man, also a former stage actor, really brings the \\"showmanship\\" part.  Combined with his vocal edge, the whole combo suits the music perfectly.  NWOBHM influenced with some progressive /theatrical influences is the best way to describe this, think the more sinister side of Savatage.  A couple longer, epic style songs (Blasphemy & the Master/ The Devil's Deadly Weapon/ No Martyrs Cage) have a lot of atmosphere coupled with interesting lyrical content.  Simple yet effective riffage & plenty of quick-cutting lead guitar mastery make this work.  Overall, this is a fun listen & I eagerly look forward to the next batch of songs they can cook up.  To think how awesome this woulda sounded back when originally planned for release is just a mind tease, especially if the final product was exaclty like this.

055358894X|5.0|This was a refreshingly fun novel, extremely well-written with great plot twists that keep the reading guessing.  If you enjoy a good, fun read, this is the book for you.  This book is based on its characters, like all good books should be.  Locke Lamora is an intriguing person, obviously too smart for his own good, who finds ways to deceive, cheat and con, all the while having you rooting for him to succeed.  The book follows several plots in the beginning, which merge into one story at the end.  It also uses flashbacks in a very convincing and literate style.  You look forward to reading both the current story and reading about the characters' pasts as well.  There's so much hackneyed, crappy fantasy out there nowadays, reading a book like this is refreshing and I do hope the author gets more recognition for his free-wheeling writing style that doesn't overburden the reader with too many characters, too many settings, too much confusing politics, all without advancing the story.  (Yes, I'm talking about George HBO Martin.)  This book has a sequel, with another one on the way, but the story in this book actually ends.  You don't have to read a sequel if you don't want to!  Imagine that.
0385343175|5.0|A fiction book by Danielle Steele whom I've read  all her previous books and even if it didn't say it was written by her you would know it by her writing style. Her stories are generally entertaining as this one was.
B000F3UAFC|4.0|If you focus on the four characters the Windmeres and Hunt's and Wilkenson's characters and call all the rest of the characters a chorus, then you have a nice little Greek theater, set in Italy. When I looked at the film in this manner, I liked it a lot.<br /><br />Hunt and Wilkenson are superb. They have the limelight in this film. In an extreme contrast are Johansson and her character husband. The acting was so poor. As gorgeous as Johannson is, her lines were awkward and stilted, as if she didn't understand them or the story.<br /><br />An up side to the film were the costumes, pretty prints with heeled Buster Browns. The clothing was airy, perfect for the Southern Italian coast.<br /><br />The tension between Hunt and Wilkenson was the best. I'm now curious about the Wilde's writing. I will have to read it.<br /><br />A pretty film with great lines.
B000TRXRUY|5.0|\\"Enter the Dragon\\" is a very enjoyable martial arts themed movie staring Bruce Lee as an undercover agent attempting to bring down a powerful drug lord that also happens to host a martial arts tournament for the best fighters in the world. This is a fun movie action flick that is also a bit of glimpse back at the early 1970s. It was also great to show this to my teen son when he started taking martial arts.<br /><br />There are interesting back-stories for most of the important fighters, a good bit of humor, and even a classic bit of revenge, but the the best parts are the fantastic fighting scenes. Bruce Lee was an amazing athlete and this movie highlights his great skill. The acting is a bit over the top, but fits this type of movie well.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

B004EPZ0AC|1.0|This movie is not that funny as expected, esp. not for children. In addition, there is too much drama esp. for a movie like that. Sometimes it was boring and i was happy as the movie was over.
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|I love this movie. I have watched it several times...and I love it each time. The actors were cast so perfectly for their parts, right down to the spy guard who was being paid by wicked stepmother to dish on the castle's secrets. Drew was awesome and so very convincing as Cinderella (even with her fake but forgive-able English accent). Angelica Huston is probably the best wicked stepmother ever! I loved the chemistry between Cinderella and Prince Henry. The use of Leonardo Da Vinci in place of the famed fairy godmother truly elevates this timeless story up a notch, from a mere children's fairytale to a beautiful romance with which any romantic at heart can identify. My only criticism, though not enough to mark down my rating, is that I've always felt the dialogue at the end, between Cinderella and Prince Henry, seemed to be missing that little special something that was always present in all other scenes they had together. It wasn't their chemistry as this was still intact right to the end. I think the script was just a little lukewarm at this point. That notwithstanding, still love the movie, and it is definitely one that will find it's place among my collection of romance movies.
B0067QPVD2|3.0|This is a solid movie worth at least one viewing. The Thing reminds me of the mindless action movies you see during the summer, you go in with the expectations that there will be flaws, but as long as things blow up your happy. The character development is almost nonexistent and the people seem more like alien fodder than one's you should care about. Which is to bad because there are some characters you want to get to know more about, something you like that makes them standout and you root for them. But the movie just speeds right along and before you know it it's over. The nice thing is there are some fun moments and good eye candy effects to keep a person entertained. I will say that a few of the CGI shots are weak, but overall the effects are a good mix of practical and computer. This movie is best watched with friends and popcorn.  I'm looking forward to listening to the commentaries, I have watched some interviews with the director and he is very articulate. I'm sure he will reveal some goodies about filming, much like Kurt and John did. Also the deleted scenes are supposed to be worthwhile, especially the one with the character Colin in it.  Cheers  ps This is a three star movie as far as overall quality compared to all movie genres. However, when it comes to sci-fi horror I give it a 4 star. Despite its flaws this movie is better than most in this category.
B00542USJW|5.0|It's awesome that I was able to get this movie in a Blu-ray so I could remember my childhood! It was great being able to get it so fast! Thank you so much!
B0036TGSIK|5.0|my first time seeing Emma Stone in a movie I must admit and she was sooo funny. Not your typical high school drama movie...this one was more laughter and flair. anybody debating on this should buy it now and watch it asap. I didnt listened to all the people saying crap about it and finally went to the nearest store and bought it. My suggestion though just go up this page and click add to cart right now.
B0061IMJBI|5.0|This is one of the best tv shows that have come out in a long time. Bravo.<br />My boyfriend and I are hooked!
B004EPZ084|5.0|Been waiting a long time for a movie like this to come out. Something that has got some real life drama going on and a funny way to deal with it.I got this movie a few days ago and put it in right away and have been wathing it over and over. The actors in this are amazing never thought jennifer aniston would do such a role but she plays it perfect. Not for the kids but for the fun loving adults. Once you start watching it you will not want to stop.
1589795474|4.0|I think The Millionaire Next Door was spot on when saying that people should learn to live within their means. We don't have to drive luxury cars, wear the finest clothes, send our children to the finest schools, or live in the biggest houses to make it to the status of millionaire. If the couple, mentioned in the book that averaged $90,000 a year income, can retire as millionaires then there is hope for the masses to reach this great mile stone. This book has also made me reevaluate the people that I see driving all the luxury foreign cars!
B0069WUZVM|5.0|Saw this with my sister at the theater and was waiting for it to be really bad like the critics said it was gonna be. Read  reviews saying nothing in the trailer was in the movie so I was expecting the worse. When it started playing we were scared out of our seats. From the very beginning to the end you can expect some scary stuff going on. Out of all the paranormal movies this one is my favorite by far. And i actually like that nothing in the trailer showed up cause it made the movie more creepy. Gonna buy it as soon as it comes out. LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!
0321704452|4.0|The Naked Presenter was full of interesting ideas on how to give a better presentation. The author was spot on when he suggests turning the speech into a conversation, and to get the audience involved with the conversation. There were so many different perspectives from so many good speakers in the book. I think this allows the reader to improve his ability to give a better presentation. This book is a definite \\"must read\\".
0385335997|5.0|This is the third of Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series.  They are quite addicting.  As with the first two books, you'll cry and get so engaged that you'll want to just take a day off to read this book.

B0049P1VHS|5.0|I'm a big fan of horror.  HOWEVER, the zombie genre is waaaaaay down on the bottom of my 'to watch' list.  I've seen them, but personally I don't like them very much, never really have.  Maybe it's because at one time these were human beings.  Heck, even the young aren't spared the possibiltiy of being turned into a rotling.  And, it's never just one zomboid comin' after your arse, but a bagillion at once. The walking dead have always just creeped me out!    With that being said my son MADE me watch the first episode.  I was sooooo agitated, uneasy, and hyper darn near yelling at the TV to \\"SHOOT IT, SHOOT IT, DON'T GO IN THERE, RUN YOU SOB, RUN!!, DON'T GO DOWN IN THAT PITCH BLACK STAIRWELL, DON'T DO THAT, GO GO GO!!!  (alas, the TV nor the actors ever listen!).  Yet, by the end of the first episode and how it ended, I felt strangely compelled to watch another episode. YEAH.... let's set myself up for more MAJOR squik factors, agitation, and nightmares which are sure to follow!    Needless to say, I'm hooked!!  I love this show!  It's so much more than just the rotlings looking for their next snackie. Plus you find yourself saying, \\"Oh hell no..... a person wouldn't do this or that\\", thereby putting yourself in the situation of how you'd handle yourself in a Zombie Apocalypse.    This show definately elicits strong emotional repsonses from the viewing audience, as this core group of survivors do some bone head things.  I think that's why I get agitated & aggrevated, because in a real life survival situation, you wouldn't DO some of the DUMB THINGS they do. No way in hell I'd be going out into the forest to pick mushrooms alone....ALONE!!!! \\"Off I trapse, tra la, tra la.....\\" I'd have more friggin' armed sentry around me than the Queen of England protectin' my butt!!. I'd also be raiding places for silencers, heck, even poor man silencers would do, (noise attracts the rotlings, among other things).  But then if our group of survivors didn't do all these stupid things, we wouldn't have a show, now would we?  I would soooo want Daryl on my side when things go in the pooper!...  Go Team Daryl! He rocks!!  Glen also has a good head on this shoulders.    There are excellent character dynamics going on.  You come to care about these folks in their quest for survival.  Some of their behavior will shock and surprise.  But that's what makes this show awesome, you're never really sure what's happening next. The special effects are quite good too. The first season was only 6 episodes long.  A&E wanted to see how well this show would be received.  Apparently it's been overwhelmingly positive.  Season 2 is following suit, though a little bit slower paced. They didn't have to cram so much into just six episodes, and the mid-season finale for season 2 was a corker!!  Even those who get squiked and are squimish about rotlings and all things dead should give this series a try.  I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at just how good it is.   ~ jade ~
B005HSG3TC|5.0|excellent cover for its now lower 30 dollar price. excellent material. well crafted. fits the kindle PERFECTLY. very misrepresented by other reviews. i can see why kindle chose it to be its main case. if strong, light, compact, stand-convertable is what you are looking for look no further. haven't tried the leather case though. DO NOT GET ANY SCREEN PROTECTOR FOR ANYTHING MADE OUT OF GORRILA GLASS (what kindle fire is made of, as well as ipads, android phones, iphones, etc.) any screen protector just inhibits the kindle fire potential. lookup gorrilla glass and see if anyone else recommends any screen protector. nobody. dont make my mistake and buy any screen protector. theyre just annoying to apply and counterproductive to protecting ur product. buy this case and ur good to go. GET THIS CASE YOU WON'T REGRET IT. it also works as an excellent stand that looks hot if u use the strap. get it in black also. also don't forget to smoke weed.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|I don't often watch television, and I definitely never commit myself to being in front of it at a given time every week.  However, by chance I watched the first episode of Boardwalk Empire on HBO.  It was in the middle of the season and I fell in love. I can not wait until this is released so my fiancee who works Sunday nights when the series is on HBO can watch it with me.  I count down the days to a new episode of season 2 all week long!
B004MPESSY|4.0|I'm you basic northern city-boy. I find this to be a completely accurate depiction of the pond-scum breeding in the deep south. Those people, if you want to want to call them that, claim to be more moral and righteous, but then they do stuff like this. This kind of thing actually happens; northern girls, usually college students, stray into the wrong part of Podunk, and get raped and murdered by the subhuman locals. AND the whole town usually covers it up. So I really enjoyed seeing her get her revenge; Justice.
0385333846|5.0|The Allied bombing of Dresden Germany is THE singular event which dominates this rightful classic by Kurt Vonnegut.<br /><br />According to Vonnegut the bombing claimed over 135000 lives and left the city of Dresden looking like a jagged moonscape.<br /><br />For his part it no doubt left part's of Vonnegut's soul just as ravaged and because the scene was such a horror, Vonnegut has to struggle to even find a way to look at the event.<br /><br />His mundane way of looking at the event of course is in the person of Billy Pilgram, a ne'er do well soldier who wasn't even carrying a weapon when he was captured by the Germans during the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944.  In Pilgram we see a less than average soldier surviving against horrible odds in spite of himself and not because of any great merit on his part.  After the war, we see Pilgram propser again not because of himself but rather more in spite of the odds.<br /><br />In a less mundane way, Vonnegut uses science fiction as a vehicle for obliquely viewing inhumanity.  After a head injury Pilgram reports that he's spent his life being \\"unstuck in time\\" which Vonnegut uses effectively as a device for having Pilgram relive different portions of his life.<br /><br />As part of his \\"unstuck in time\\" travels Pilgram meets Tralfamadorians, or creatures from Tralfamadore who resemble plumbers helpers with a hand located at the top of the helper with an eye where the palm would otherwise be.<br /><br />In dialogues with the Tralfamadorians, Pilgram learns that human notions of time are different than the way time really is.  In this part of the book, Vonnegut provides a spot on description of so called block time where all events that ever happened are still happening now...albeit on a different chronological date.  So Julius Caesar remains alive and well but you'd have to go back to PRIOR to March 14 48 BCE to meet him.  Because it turns out that this is something Tralfamadorians can do they help Pilgram flush out his \\"unstuck in time\\" issues.<br /><br />In reading about Pilgram and the Tralfamadorians and all that I couldn't help but be impressed with the range of Vonnegut's imagination. However I also couldn't help seeing it for what it ultimately was...a smokescreen for the real issue of why he or Pilgram yet survived that bombing when so many others did not.<br /><br />Like all survivor guilt, there's ultimately no right explanation.  And whether those who precede us yet remain alive somewhere in time they nonetheless remain separated from us humans by an impenetrable wall.<br /><br />This book of course does not tear down that wall.  Maybe nothing can.  But it certainly takes us inside Vonnegut's horror over its existence which I guess is why this book is such a rightful classic in the first place.the Tralfamadorians and all that I couldn't help but be impressed with the range of Vonnegut's imagination.

B0036T31YY|1.0|I rented this off iTunes, and I wish I didn't. It's your basic time-loop flick. The acting sucked, writing sucked. The best part of the film was the 30 seconds of CG weather. Don't waste your money.
0515142247|4.0|Yes, that;s a lame review title but it kind of fits the book.  I enjoy Child's writing and his imaginative powers, but he asks a little too much of the reader with this one.  I won't say I was ever bored or considered not finishing, because the story is good fun all the way through.  It's not great literature but it is pretty good escapism, and sometimes that's more than enough.
9500421038|1.0|yes , yes people just dont buy here they are very irresponsible to process your order...and guess what...they ship your package and the tracking number is wrong...hey I order before Thanksgiving,and guess what ...I'm stil waiting for my package .......
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|This is really well done software. Good enough that the Kindle Fire is about to be my preferred platform to keep up with my Goggle Reader RSS feeds. I've been reasonably happy with the regular browser interface, and the mobile interface under iOS works well enough for me. This is better. I can view by tag / folder, see headline or preview the beginning of each article, send a url by email or clip to Evernote.  Offline reading hasn't been important to me before, but I think I 'll have to try it.<br /><br />This software just works. Highly recommended.
B001UV4XIS|1.0|One More Time! My older eMac running Mac OS X 10.5.8 is file compatible with the latest MacBook, the iPad2, and our Airport Extreme router. But this fake streaming video garbage calling itself UltraViolet Digital Copy is NOT compatible! It is NOT a digital copy, and as many times as they ram it down my throat telling me that it is, will not change the fact that it is NOT! Digital Copy is a lie!!! Don't tell me your giving me something (and worse yet are charging me for the licensing) when you are NOT! Liars all!
B002JH3TW8|5.0|Not much to it, of course.  A simple little cable adapter.  But, worked perfectly for me and saved me from having to purchase new firewire devices since Apple stopped putting the Firewire 400 ports on their MacBook Pros.  Plugged the adapter on the end of the cable, plugged the adapter into the Firewire port, and OS mounted the drive, and away I went.  Detected no problems in file transfers.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've been using SwiftKey since its first iteration, and it just keeps getting better. I've also used the stock Froyo and Gingerbread keyboards, as well as Swype, but none let me type as quickly as SwiftKey. I wish there were more customization options for the appearance, but otherwise this keyboard is stellar. I recommend it to all of my friends that use Android.
0618918248|1.0|As an atheist polemic, this fails on multiple levels.  Dawkins's scientific work, which is full of interest and merit, is in evolutionary biology.  While I believe in God, I accept the fact of evolution and human evolution too.  In his zeal to condemn religion, he seems to have forgotten some of his biology.<br /><br />The shock begins with the preface.  Dawkins begins with a catalogue of various atrocities perpetrated by humans who cited religion as a motive.  He seems to imagine that, were it not for belief in religions, none of these horrors would have happened and we could all hold hands around the campfire and sing \\"Imagine\\".  Were he a mere atheist, this might be credible.  But as an evolutionary biologist, he ought to realize this utopia is unworthy of belief.  Were religion entirely absent, humans would still be violent, tribal, xenophobic, and jealous.  They evolved those traits.  Religion had nothing to do with it.  Removing deities from human culture simply makes them need to choose some other symbol to make war over.<br /><br />This is why evolution and faith reside happily together in my skull.  Biology turns a cold and piercing gaze on the human character, as does the apostle Paul.  Dawkins knows that the human character is a problem. The flaws he ascribes to religion are in fact flaws in us; they will not vanish by getting rid of the hypothesis of a deity.  He rails against religion, as if it was the one thing that separated him from an earthly paradise, which he could enter if the barrier were removed. Which is why Dawkins makes a poor, unconvincing, and rather boring polemicist as well.<br /><br />He compares badly to Daniel Dennett, whose [[ASIN:0143038338 Breaking the Spell]] and [[ASIN:068482471X Darwin's Dangerous Idea]] are quite superior to this as atheist apologetics.  Even if you don't follow him all the way to his conclusions, you always feel like you're learning something reading these Dennett works.  Dennett isn't overcome by the choking fury you see throughout this text.  Dennett isn't wasting your time.is text.  Dennett isn't wasting your time.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Love this case.  Got a clear backing to show off your iPhone.  It has circular grooves that makes a pattern which doesn't bother me but wished it was totally clear.  Comes with a screen protector.  It's also great that the case has a raised edge that goes over the front of the iPhone so your screen will be protected even if you have it facing down.
B005COO1X6|5.0|I must admit I ate this little novella right up. It was tightly written, just horrific and just funny enough for a quick read. Lovecraft would have smiled in approval. Mr. King has been my near-lifelong pal and his books have gotten me through good times and bad, and I found this little piece to be a near-perfect illustration of why he is so wildly popular. Even in a short story/novella he manages to draw his characters as real people, folks you know, the ones in your neighborhood or who you grew up with. And once again he shows how sometimes kids have it all over the adults when it comes to being wise.... their minds are wide open. Some of his books have given me plenty of nightmares- I should not have read Pet Sematary when I was pregnant! and this one would have for certain if I were younger. I loved the premise and wish he'd made it into a full-lenth book, but as it stands it's juicy, scary fun. Sink your teeth into it on a rainy night, you won't be sorry!! Thanks, Steve-o!!
B000IOLYWQ|3.0|False Advertising - this is NOT the - ORIGINAL MASTER RECORDING - it's a remix by dave mustane and it sounds like it's mixed by a guitarist.  the original mix i feel is far superior to this reattempt. to bad mobile fidelity went with this and not the \\"original master recording\\". other than that it's a high quality 180g quiet pressing.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|This is a very nice Christmas collection.  I have been looking for a good CD for Christmas time, and Michael Buble did a good job.  It is a little jazzy, but still very good.
B003L77GH4|5.0|The first season was incredible, and this one starts right where the last one left off, and it just keeps getting better! This is one show I've been a fan of since the first episode and I recommend it to anyone who likes the supernatural, or even love, drama, or action. It's a great show, and a shining jewel in the current vampire hysteria that will hopefully continue to amaze. I hope everyone watches it and enjoys.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|One of the best albums I have ever laid ears on! Having never really been a \\"fan\\" of Florence and the Machine, after Dog Days of Summer, I began to have an interest. Now, with \\"Ceremonials\\" I am hooked! Simply one of the most amazing albums I have encountered.
0553807919|5.0|Wonderfully written insight into the minds of children.  A great help with my special needs child and for my other children.  Must read for any parent wanting to enrich their parenting experience.
B0013K6WLM|2.0|For years I've heard the same argument:  The Black Keys are better than The White Stripes.  Having seen the 'Stripes in concert as well as owning all their albums, I'm inclined to argue the above statement is false, but that's just me.  Then I listened to \\"Attack and Release\\" and found that I was right after all.<br /><br />Before I continue, no, I have not seen the 'Keys play live, and this is the first of their albums I've heard.  With that said, this is the perfect album to listen to if you want to immediately lose interest in this band.  It sounds muddy and over-produced and doesn't do either of these musicians justice.  To be perfectly honest, I think it's an insult.  Dan and Patrick are turned way down and all of Danger Mouse's little added bits are pushed to the forefront.  This band is a two-piece, and it should sound like a two-piece unless otherwise noted.<br /><br />Aside from the poor production of this album, I found the songwriting to be rather boring and uninspired.  These guys have a reputation for putting on one heck of a rock & roll show, but this album barely has any rock & roll songs on it.  Instead, we're given a bunch of blues-influenced pop tunes.  If you want to listen to a really good 'Keys album, pick up a copy of \\"Brothers.\\"  Avoid this garbage at all costs.
0553386794|4.0|OK, so here's the deal, if you liked the TV show (which I did, a lot!), you'll like the book... cuz it is virtually identical.<br /><br />Love 'em both!!
1594489505|5.0|This book is amazing. Well written and vivid to ones own imagination. I am once again reminded of how blessed and fortunate I am. I would reccomend this book to anyone.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|anyone who is about to do the same mistake that i did which is buy the book then read the reviews will realize the latter is far more exciting to read.   i can only agree with most of the other reviews here. this is not a story this is a rip off. it seems like a twilight only that the characters are adults.  literally nothing happens and the only thing that kept me finish reading was i wanted to find out how the book ends.   here is the spoiler alert. so dont read on if you want to find out yourself.  literally nothing happens which makes it the most unsatisfying read ever. and if this is just some clever idea to get readers to buy into a sequel if there is any then am sorry to say it doesnt work. i would certainly not want to give another penny to this author.
B0054VVRBQ|5.0|Card readers are generally lagging SD card development.  Grievously lagging.  A good deal of the problem is that USB2 just isn't fast enough to keep up with the transfer speeds the faster SD cards can achieve lately.  Enter Transcend with this PCIe Express Card reader.  With it, you will NOW see the full speed that your cards (probably the ones you've been complaining about) can deliver.  Just for example, the latest SanDisk Extreme Pro cards claim 90MB/sec read speed.  Well, in the built-in reader in my Dell Laptop (only a year and a half old) they most they'll do is about 15.5MB/sec write and 22MB/sec read.  Yikes.  In this Transcend reader, they deliver 100% full speed, about 45MB/sec write (yes!) and slightly higher than the claimed 90MB/sec read.  Wow.  That's seriously smokin fast.  I went out with my D300s and shot 200 miscellaneous frames at 6/sec.  The camera didn't slow down once.  Then I transferred those 200 ~8MB files to a disk on my network server in about 20 seconds. Wow.  That's the first time with any reader I've come anywhere close to those speeds.  For the few $$ this thing costs, and assuming that you have a laptop that has an available Express Card slot, you shouldn't hesitate to add one of these adapters.  One minor note:  The adapter won't be recognized in Windows unless you install the driver first.  You have to visit Transcend's site to get that [Amazon won't let me put the URL to the driver here.  You'll have to get it from the package insert where it's in rather tiny letters.] and then click on the ambiguous little flag in the upper right corner to localize.  The driver sets up in Win 7 in a couple of seconds and doesn't require a reboot.  Then when you plug in the adapter, you'll hear the \\"new device\\" sound, and cards you plug in will be automatically added to the list of drives.  And on a related subject, when you look at reviews for SD cards, particularly the latest high speed types, and the reviewer is complaining about the slow speednot meeting the spec, you can probably ignore those measurements and conclusions due to the fact that virtually ALL card readers are the speed limitation for the measurement.  Especially anything that runs on USB2, which is technically too slow to keep up with any of the faster new cards.  For example, I recently bought an inexpensive PQI 8GB Class 10 card for archival purposes.  The speed measured out at 10/20 in the Dell internal card reader.  In the Transcend, in the same Dell, it measured 16.7/23.3.  That's quite a difference.  Every other card I tested, except the very slowest/oldest was considerably faster in this Transcend reader.  Anyway, I highly recommend this for anyone using fast SD-XC or SD-UHS-1 cards in their cameras.  You'll be very pleased at the much higher transfer speed than you've suffered with in your other readers.
B000HA4WT8|4.0|This movie is a love letter to cars, drifting, and Japanese culture (as interpreted by an American).  The plot is a classic Bad Boy Makes Good, with a face-off battle to win in the end.  It's simple, direct, and accomplishes its mission very well.  Other movies in the Fast & The Furious franchise come off as cheesy.  They try to be gritty and realistic, but with poor acting and contrived situations, they end up looking cheap and silly.  Tokyo Drift, on the other hand, takes advantage of a setting foreign enough that the ludicrous elements work well together.  Also, it involves exhibition of more real driving skill than any of the others.  The production value is generally quite high.  Nearly all of it was filmed in the United States, but they did a very impressive job with sets and location selection, such that it really feels like Japan most of the time.  The \\"Japanese\\" in the film are primarily a conglomeration of various Asian American ethnicities, but really, it was done so much better than most other mainstream films which contain supposedly Japanese characters (e.g. Memoirs of a Geisha, which featured strong Chinese accents).  The soundtrack is extremely well selected and help keep the tempo up throughout the film.  If you think it's ludicrous that Yakuza mobsters would attend the local high school, or that street racers would have drift-offs in the local parking garage, stop and ask yourself how realistic any show or movie about teens has ever been.
0525423656|5.0|Crossed is told in alternating viewpoints by Cassia and Ky.  We find them both in their respective unpleasant situations and follow them through the wilderness and to each other.  There are new characters that help Ky and Cassia in their way, and each have a sad past of their own.  It is not unlike a war story, with painful sacrifices and emotional bonding.  The friends they make along the way adds new depth to the book and provides a sense that the rebellion is much bigger and more important than the two star-crossed lovers.  Their journeys made me feel that much more invested in the story and I wanted to see everyone make it, not just Cassia and Ky.<br /><br />The alternating viewpoints made the book.  I absolutely loved getting a glimpse into Ky's thoughts.  I admit that after reading Matched, I really only felt attached to Cassia's character, but I became fully invested in the story with Crossed.  You are able to really appreciate the bond that Ky and Cassia share as you are privy to Ky's vulnerability and Cassia's single minded and idealistic vision of the rebellion.  Their love for each other is deep, but there is still Ky's past that he hasn't revealed to Cassia and the truth about Xander.  As much as you find out about the characters you grew to love, there is still so much more and the bittersweet ending will leave you wishing you had the third book already.

1451648537|5.0|This is a truly fantastic book. I really did not know much about Steve Jobs. Now I regret not having followed his remarkable career more closely. This book should be required reading for members of any company, industry, or organization that is looking improve the way it does business. I am in healthcare, and Jobs'insistance on making people from different departments and specialties work together on projects is just what the industry needs. No fiefdoms or competing agendas were allowed. Jobs was a task master to be sure, and apparently not a very nice indivdual to deal with, but the overarching theme of the book is that for those willing and able to deal with him and work for him, they did the best work they ever could have done. And they all insist they never would have realized their full potential without him. This has been an important and life changing book for me.
B0016K40KY|5.0|From the acting, photography, editing, color, soundtrack,  and brilliant direction, this film is the ONE.Directors from all over the world up to Spielberg and Scorsese have crowned this epic with every accolade imaginable. 13 major international directors and 23 major producers approached David Lean and said to him, in effect, \\"We salute you for \\"Lawrence of Arabia,\\" and we are here to tell you at this dinner in your honor that we could never come close to the artistry of \\"Lawrence\\" and so walk behind you as apprentices, if that.\\" (I paraphrase some of this, which is actually much longer and filled with detailed praise.)They all stood up and cheered and David Lean wept.<br /><br />One magnificent scene after another!
1609611543|3.0|A lot of this book was boring and I skimmed it telling me the history of this or the history of that. Could have been cut by at least a hundred pages and not affected the important message he's purveying, if he'd just shut up and write less. In truth its either poor editing or the publishers themselves \\"beefing\\" up the book, getting him to write more info. and data, most of all the \\"histories\\" he goes into.<br />However, I do take his thesis seriously and have cut wheat out.<br />One of the greatest points this book makes and my personal bete noir is that corporations are killing us to make money. Is that not obvious by now given the OWS movement and the casino mentality of the financial world. But it all goes even beyond that into something like food that kills you, drugs that kill you to treat the maladies caused by the food that's killing you. And all the clowns of both parties a party to the corporate slaughter that will only result in bringing the civilization down on our heads because of immorality and the profit motive.<br />Read the book, get off wheat, see what happens, beware the entire health care industry, stop spending money you don't need to, resist the corporate and marketing culture because for the moment there's no way to overthrow it but you have to subvert it.

B002KSPKRS|5.0|First things first, there is no way I would have paid $200 for this headset, but that can be said for any headset including the turtle beach PX5.  Thankfully I got this for a song after Amazon's Cyber Monday $100 deal, and some credits I had kicking around.  I paid less than $75, and I was willing to pay $140, which is what they're selling for now.<br /><br />Everyone says wireless routers cause a problem.  YES they do.  I have a router about 3 feet from this and every few minutes the audio drops for a fraction of a second.  It's annoying.  But since that router is secondary, and it's only so I can use wireless devices like my cell or tablet in the living room, I can pull the plug on it, and play with no audio issues whatsoever.  I imagine that if you can get your wireless router 30 feet from this device, it shouldn't pose a problem.  I know the wireless router I have 60 feet away doesn't interfere.  So clearly there is a relatively short distance you can move the router that it will not be problematic.  If you know this going into this purchase, you will not be surprised when and if the issue arises.  I'm not sure if having the Xbox wireless adapter will make the problem more prominent, but it might.  If you want to prevent this distortion, your only option is going to be to pay $200-$250 for the Bluetooth equivalent of this; The Turtle Beach Ear Force PX5 (I'd post the amazon link if it would let me.)<br /><br />All that being said, I don't see any other negatives with this headset.  It performs as I expected, and probably a little better considering how many people were crying about the router interference issue.  I've been paying a lot of Skyrim with it lately, and the 5.1 surround is really impressive (yes I know it supports 7.1, but the Xbox doesn't).  You can really hear things creeping around, and all the subtle conversations the NPC's have that you'd otherwise struggle to hear.<br /><br />Probably the only thing that bugs me is that I get such heightened senses from not being able to hear external sounds, that it really weirds me out when someone in the house comes up on me while I'm playing.  I suppose that's a testament to how immersive this headset actually makes the experience.<br /><br />Bottom line.  This is a good buy.  It might be worth what they are currently asking for it ($139.99) but I think a $100 price point would make this a must have for all gamers.  If you have the coin, pick it up.  Or you can always send your gently used games to Amazon's trade in program and get credit good for use on Amazon products.  That'll ease some of the financial burden.  These are great, and I am absolutely satisfied with their performance.<br /><br />[EDIT]  I recently tried connecting to this by analog cable and was greeted with horrible amounts of hiss.  This must be the source of many of the complaints.  If you cannot connect this VIA an optical TOS-link cable, don't bother buying this.  But if you can connect it that way, DO it, it's awesome!nses from not being able to hear external sounds, that it really weirds me out when someone in the house comes up on me while I'm playing.

B004MC8CA2|3.0|I like the app, but you need a Wi-Fi connection for it to work. For me that is a big negative. If i want to read a book of any kind i dont want to have to be concerned where i am at and if i need a Wi-Fi connection.

1936719010|4.0|You really need to read The War of Art first before picking this book up.  This is a great review and follow up on the basics of fear... but then takes it to the next level.

B005Y423ZC|5.0|I love all kinds of concerts including shows with crazy lights, frantic choreography, and fireworks. But an Adele show is the antitheses of those types of shows. On Adele: Live At The Royal Albert Hall, she gives us what we need most of all - good music. While other artists give us their alter-egos in wild make-up, colorful hair, and outrageous outfits, Adele gives us herself where you feel as if you're having a conversation with a good friend. Her personality in all its rawness shines through, and she is intelligently expressive and emotional in her delivery of each song. With that type of power, there is no need for all the other stuff. '21' will stand the test of time, and this concert DVD is one for the collection.<br /><br />The only song from '21' she desn't perform is \\"He Won't Go\\" which I love and seem to be in the minority. But for me the inclusion of her performance of Bonnie Raitt's \\"I Can't Make You Love Me\\" and the Steeldrivers' \\"If It Hadn't Been For Love\\" more than makes up for its omission. She also performs her biggest hits from '19' including \\"Chasing Pavements\\" and concert-opener \\"Hometown Glory\\".<br /><br />Adele was plagued with vocal nodules during the year that resulted with a number of postponements and ultimately the cancellation of the last leg of her North American tour. Knowing this, you may be worried about the performances on this DVD. No need. Adele is in excellent form here. Many great reviews have already been written and videos samples from the DVD are available to help you decide, so I won't repeat what's already been said. But if you were heart-broken because you held a ticket to one of her shows that was eventually canceled like I did, this DVD is the next best thing. Highly recommended!
0439813786|5.0|This book is not a true novel, but it's also more than a picture book.  It's like a slide show of art that also tells the story in written format.  The best parts of the book are the images, which drew me into the story and added to the fascination.  Although there's not as much text as you would expect from a book of this size, you will want to take your time looking at the details in the images.  If you like books like the Polar Express and Jumanji, this book is in a similar style with the elements of fantasy, but the volume is much longer.

0307938905|4.0|This was an intriguing book, but I have to say I think the initial buzz and reviews are off the mark in terms of theme.  The book is heavily promoted and reviewed as a romance between two practitioners of magic, but from my perspective, this is really a story about legacies.  The first night circus legacy was born out of competition and anxiety, the second out of love and hope.  Taken in this context, the second-person narrative woven throughout the volume makes clear that the real POV character is the reader, learning about both legacies and discovering the circus' hidden mysteries little by little.  It was a lovely little story, with a gentle tone and a relaxed pace that conveyed a sense of atmosphere rather than a steamrolling plot. I imagine it would make a delightful film.  I'll also add that the audiobook version featured a terrific reader who created distinct voices for each of the many characters and genuinely brought the story to life.

0385534639|3.0|I had heard a lot of buzz about this book so I decided I'd read it and see if it was worth all the buzz. When I first started it I was in love with the circus. I how Erin Morgenstern described the circus, and I loved the idea of a night circus. The circus was magical and I found myself becoming a reveur. I felt like I was right there marveling at all the wonders of the circus. I would say that for about the first half I was absolutely enraptured with the novel. Everything changed once Celia and Marco started falling in love with each other. Surprisingly I wasn't fond of this relationship, hey I'm all for lovey-dovey romance but I felt like this was kinda forced and awkward. I know that it was pretty much crucial to the plot for the second half, but I just didn't enjoy that as much as the first half. As the circus started to unravel so did some of my love for the book. But then Erin Morgenstern ended the book keeping me still liking the book by giving the circus to Bailey.  I was enchanted by the first half, lost some love in the middle, and liked the end. I would still recommend this book to fantasy and magic lovers, but I would warn them to be prepared for some cheesy/lovey dovey romance in the middle/end.
0385341008|4.0|I chose this book by chance at my local library.  I mean the title has so much promise doesn't it.  It was an amazing glimpse(albeit fictional) into life on a somewhat obscure(at least to this American) island during World War II.  It gets a bit dreamy and nostalgic in parts but overall it was a wonderful read.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|I liked the look and feel of this case when I first received it, and it still seems to protect my iPhone well (I have never dropped it, though). The screen protector that comes with it is a really nice one, too, and is actually better than one my husband ordered for his separately. The main problem I have with this case is that the material has yellowed significantly since I purchased it two months ago. It is no longer totally clear and has resulted in a cheap look. I think the case was worth it for the price, but I'll soon be purchasing a case that will continue to look nice as it's used.
B006FTCH2E|2.0|Ok, for a darkly introspective, sloooow movie about a deeply miserable main character, this was ok. This is a story about a girl who kills a man's family in a car accident and spends the rest of the movie fighting her own guilt and trying to make his life better. That's it. If you know that going into it (and are still interested) it might be a good movie. But if you're expecting a movie about \\"Another Earth\\", forget it, you'll get none of that here, aside from a few musings of what it all might mean to us played on radios and TV's the characters have on now and then. There are NO special effects other than ocasional shots of the other earth in the sky above ours. Calling it science fiction is a little misleading, unlike the title which is very misleading. It'd be better described as a long, drawn-out, dark episode of the Twilight Zone.
B003Y5H57E|5.0|I really loved this movie.  It's a down to earth love story that isn't happily ever after - like real life. I laughed.  I cried.  I've never wanted to be Emma Stone more than just to be opposite Ryan Gosling.  I'm so glad I bought this film instead of renting it. Can't wait to watch it for the second time.

014241543X|4.0|If I Stay was kind of a frustrating read.  I had heard all the hype about the book, and with the upcoming author event, was feeling pressured to like the book.  As I kept reading, though, the book dragged me in, and I ended up finishing it up in a single sitting.  The music references were a bit overwhelming at times, even though you don't really need to understand them, unless you want an enhanced reading experience.  Adam is pretty much that perfect boy, which, you can have your complaints about him being a two-dimensional character, but all of those complaints are thrown out the window when you read Where She Went, which is entirely written in Adam's perspective.  I'm not going to lie, the whole premise of getting to choose whether she'd live or die seemed a bit medically iffy, although it made for convenient storytelling.  The book picks up with a beautiful conclusion, and even though I found it difficult to personally relate to, I did see why it would be a book that would strongly resonate with its readers.
B0001I561E|5.0|My 4 yr old son loves this movie.

We got a used version for this reason and it still works very well.  The shipping was fast, which was also a plus.
0525422943|5.0|Where She Went easily makes it on to my list of all-time favorite books.  You know, those books that make you feel ALL OF THE EMOTIONS and you can't stop thinking about them for hours, days, weeks after you've read them?  All of what Gayle talked about when she spoke in Pittsburgh, about how emotionally honest fiction books can be, all of that could so easily be seen in Where She Went.  I'm sure that honesty resonated with people in If I Stay, but having never experienced the death or near-death of anyone close to me, that book didn't impact me as much as a book about the unfair loss of someone who is still alive.  I found so many quotations that I could relate to and want permanently etched in my brain.  I've been grappling with the idea of \\"good\\" writing and \\"bad\\" writing and reader preferences and how unfair it is to call a person's piece of writing 'good' or 'bad', because in the end, isn't that up to the reader and how the reader relates to a specific piece?  There are rules in writing, sure, but beyond that, it's a matter of personal preference, and while I'm pretty sure most people out there, including Gayle herself, will hail If I Stay as her one big perfect hit, Where She Went is that book for me.

B001AYENBM|5.0|This version was by FAR a better finish to the story and fully wrapped up<br />dangling thoughts shown to you throughout the movie but never finished<br />by the CRAPPY theatrical movie release. This version wraps up the movie<br />in so many ways you cannot even believe the theatrical release was ever done.<br />I for one THREW AWAY my theatrical release the second I reviewed this version.<br />  This faux paux ranks right up there with 'Aliens' theatrical release versus<br />the Directors cut of 'Aliens'. When I saw the latter movie it explained so<br />much more of that story, tied things together better and caused me to throw away<br />the theatrical release of THAT movie as well. It makes me wonder where do they get<br />the test audiences for these films? Are they some kind of morons?<br />  I thank the director for shooting the better version and preserving it for us to<br />buy.

B005W3G2D4|5.0|Fifth album by Ms. Clarkson and it might just be her strongest (no pun) yet.  Every song is addictive.  Her voice soars and the quality of the production is outstanding.  Finally a CD that doesn't compress and over-process her amazing vocals.  I've seen Kelly live 9 times and this album is as close to experiencing her live as you'll get without her releasing a \\"live\\" album.    Every track is amazing but there are some stand outs that deserve special recognition.  Namely The War is over.  WOW...this song is stunning in it's simplicity and heart stirring emotion.  Also the tracks Honestly, You Love Me, and the surprisingly catching Einstein are totally earworm worthy.  Breaking Your Own Heart and the bonus track The Sun Will Rise show us that Clarkson could not only tackle but own on a country CD.    There seems to be nothing that Kelly can't do vocally and it's been a joy watching her 10 year journey and getting to enjoy her talent.

Advice for the band:  1)  James needs to start drinking again.  2)  Lars needs to shut up and play.  3)  Kirk needs to stop being philisophical and artsy-fartsy, have his balls drop back down.  4)  Fire Robert Trujillo and bring back Jason Newstead.  5)  Start being angry and dysfuncional again/get rid of the elvis side burns and the dorky faux hawk hair-do's as seen on the \\"Real World.\\"

If my wife ever divorces me this will be a good album but otherwise it's a buzz kill.

B004EPZ03O|5.0|MOVIE NOTE #14: THE MUPPETS. Disney and Jim Henson Productions have presented a very timely, heartwarming (in the Muppet way) and very funny film! I have been a Muppet fan for a long time and it's was in 1999's \\"Muppets In Space' since we last have seen them on the big screen.<br /><br />Having loved their past features (\\"A Muppet Christmas Carol' 1992 and the original `The Muppet Movie' 1979 are my favorites) Director James Bobin (BBC TV's own director of `Da Ali G Show' and `Flight of the ConChords') has brought the intelligent adult humor and gags in the way only the Muppets can deliver them! Co-written by it's leading man and Executive Producer Jason Segal (`How I Met Your Mother', `Bad Teacher' and more!) created what a lot of the early expectations of this film were worried about when it was announced  which was will the Muppets work today?<br /><br /> Since 1999 the Muppets have only been seen in two TV Movies, `A Ver Mery Muppet Christmas' in 2002  and `The Muppets Wizard f  OZ' in 2005 (also  the last episode of  `The Muppet Show'  (1976-1981) and `Muppets Tonight' (1996-1998)) - there was some speculation whether they could survive their former popularity. Guess what - They do and they did!<br /><br />Jason Segal , an admittingly GINORMOUS Muppet fan - like so many of us - thought he could develop a story that would capture all the magic of the original Muppet timing with the modern day - more intelligent - audiences of today. It basically is the story of two brothers - Garry and Walter. One human (Gary is Jason Segal) one Muppet (Walter is masterfully voiced by Peter Linz who has been a Muppet puppeteer and voice for the franchise since 1999).<br /><br />Gary and Walter are dear brothers and each of them have to deal with where they belong in their respective lives. Gary wants to take his relationship with Mary (hysterically played by Amy Adams - `Enchanted', `Julie & Julia') to the next level - and Walter just wants to visit the Muppet Studios (now deflated and in disrepair) only to discover the Muppet legacy is doomed for destruction by the evil Tex Richman. Tex is played surprisingly convincingly by Chris Cooper (`Jarhead', `Seabiscut' & `American Beauty') who even surprises the audience by Rapping a song. Yes...rapping!<br /><br />Walter, Mary and Gary set out to do the only thing they can - tell Kermit - The Frog. What's going to happen? Kermit is broken hearted in what to do. There is a deadline, obstacles and challenges for the Green Amphibian as he reunites - hysterically - the old gang. Everyone is back with the exception of Miss Piggy. The reason she doesn't want to help become clear...and even understandable. (That's all I'll say about that!)<br /><br />The movie is sprinkled with the perfect amount of song, dance numbers and `Muppetisms' that make the story, fun, adventurous and even heartwarming.<br />The songs are memorable, story driven and in some cases great nods to songs like Academy Award winning \\"The Rainbow Connection' from the original film. In fact - that song even peaks its head in this film in a most appropriate way!<br /><br />All the voice talents are brilliantly back!<br />Steve Whitman - (as Kermit / Beaker / Statler / Rizzo / Link Hogthrob / The Newsman)<br />Eric Jacbson - (as Miss Piggy / Fozzie Bear / Animal / Sam Eagle / Marvin Suggs)<br />Dave Goetz  - (as Gonzo / Dr. Bunsen Honeydew / Zoot / Beauregard)<br />Bill Barretta - (as Sweedish Chef / Rowlf / Doctor Teeth / Pepe the Prawn)<br />David Rudman - (as Scooter / Janice / Miss Poogy)<br /><br />Also, as there are in all Muppet movies, tons of cameos including; Adam Arkin, Bill Cobbs, Zach Gaifianakis, Ken Jeong, Sarah Silverman, Emily Blundt, Rashida Jones, James Carville, Whoopi Goldberg, Salena Gomez, David Grohl, Neil Patrick Harris, Judd Hirsch, John Krasinski, Rico Rodriguez, Mickey Rooney and many more! An amazing (and hysterical) surprise was where they cast `The Big Bang Theory's' own Jim Parsons! Wait till you see wherehe is!<br /><br />I think the late Mr. Jim Hensen would really love this film. If you are a fan of these felt-covered puppets - the movie delivers everything you expect - laughter, fun and warmth that can only be The Muppets. If you are not a fan, you will become one because the humor is intelligent, sarcastic and witty and this will put a smile on every family members face. This is my favorite comedy of the year! I was pleasantly surprised and you will be too!covered puppets - the movie delivers everything you expect - laughter, fun and warmth that can only be The Muppets.

B005LRWRZ8|3.0|This album isn't nearly as good as 'Endgame'. The first thing you notice right from the start is that it is way too loud. Guitars appear clipped from too much compression, even Dave's vocals become clipped at times. This alone makes it a real pain to listen to. Endgame, thankfully, didn't have this problem. Looking into it more, it looks as if Megadeth used a different producer for this album, and which is why I think it has so many issues. Beyond the compression issues, there are far too many stereo effects going from left to right, guitars and vocals. The album also seems like a kid at Christmas with a new \\"201 effects\\" pedal and decided to use as many as he could on every song. It's irritating. The gritty straight in your face guitars from Endgame (And other classics) is simply not here anymore. Perfectly clean guitars, vocals, rhythm guitar, etc. Sometimes the rhythm guitar level is simply too loud compared to the rest. I would love to rate this lower, but I can't. I am tapping my feet to some good melodies in these songs, and it's not something I will avoid listening to. I am a firm believer that when a band makes a successful album, they should stick to what works. If they can't get time to use the same people they did, then wait for it to happen. This album just feels rushed all over. Sorry, but I was expecting so much after the masterpiece that was Endgame.
B004ZNACA6|5.0|I love the music of Pink Floyd but the CD releases up to this point have just left me cold (including the MFSL, Japan pressings, etc.) This Discovery Box Set is worth every penny - I'll never listen to the other pressings again. It's like rediscovering these albums - the mastering job is that good! I agree that the packaging leaves something to be desired but most people just want to listen to the music and if it keeps the price down than that's OK with me. One of my best purchases of the year - if you are a fan you need to own this box set - really!!

One of the greatest rock albums ever recorded and finally done justice with a proper mastering - Thank You!
B005Y1B3Q0|5.0|Hello everyone. I am so happy to say, that I was able to watch the Director's Cut version of THE EXPENDABLES before it even made it to Blu Ray. And all I can say is that it is REALLY GOOD. I loved this version more than the theatrical version. The opening credits is totally different from the original theatrical version and it really was very cool and it really sets the mode for the film. I felt that this version gave the movie a lot of heart and more depth. Sylvester Stallone is truly one of a kind. He wrote, directed and starred in this film. He is the man that was able to put all these action people together in one film. I totally recommend those of you who enjoyed THE EXPENDABLES, to check out the Director's Cut version. I guarantee you it will not disappoint you :) The sequel for The Expendables is being filmed now as we speak and I think it will be BIGGER, BETTER, and more BAD @$$ :)<br />Thank you Mr. Stallone for all it is that you do.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|When the books and the TV series are complete, they will rival Lord Of The Rings for both best fantasy novel and film.  The series is true to the books (as far as I can remember). There are people writing reviews more qualified than myself to critique the visuals, the script and the acting.   The best serious drama ever for TV, maybe even best fantasy ever.

It's full of great facts and is a perfect supplement to anybodys Potter journey. We started with the books and we're in the middle of watching the movies and I'll be ending that trek with this book read. It's worth the purchase and makes for a fantastic gift.
1451648537|5.0|While my passion lies with Apple and Steve Jobs, and not with literature, this book is the most compelling story of a man's life.   Walter Isaacson turned Jobs down on the offer to write this biography not once, or twice, but three times. As you will discover in this masterpiece, the reason we have this book today, is the amazing persistence that is Steve Jobs. Isaacson finally accepted the offer and wrote five hundred and seventy one pages, with each one enticing me to flip just one more. His attention to detail to uncover the entire story, and his devotion to telling it like it is allowed him to share the incredible journey of Steve Jobs.   I felt honored to be able to read all of the stories Isaacson amassed through his interviews. The reason someone reads a biography is to understand the life of the person. A man as complex as Steve Jobs apparently needed five hundred pages to describe his five decades, but the book was better for it. Because of Isaacson, I am able to say that I respect a man I thought I knew well, so much more now that I have read this book. I encourage anyone who wants to understand how to change the world, that they should read this book to discover how Steve did it.

B0006AAS5G|5.0|It is beautiful! My husband loves this watch! It came within the shipping estimate! Will for sure recommend!  The packaging was great but the watch itself, exquisite. The watch looks beautiful in my husband's wrist; the watch it just a little big, nothing taking a length out won't fix! Totally worth the money!

I would be nice to see it officially come to the Kindle Fire with a Silk plugin to add some of the Silk features to Dolphin. I will say as a side note that the Kindle Fire is an Awesome Tablet!
B004D7GU3C|3.0|The CD is a decent production from Ricky Martin.  I was expecting a little more but he did a good job.  He is a great singer and has some definite hits.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I agree with the other guy, ya'll need a new name, but other then that I've gotten rid of all my other weather apps and now just have this one. I love the customizable widgets, radar, earthquake info, hour by hour and all the other info it provides. My only complaint is that no matter if I find my location by gps, zip code or any other means it still only gets the surrounding cities not mine. Plus, their is a major difference in the high's and lows vs intellicasts and forenco which I don't understand. But I do love the app though. I especially love the radar feature and the hour by hour. Keep up the great work guy's.
B00000IZOR|2.0|This toy was kinda frustrating for my 17 month old. The phone cord was too short and the pull string was short as well. Maybe the pull string needs to be made of a thicker rope as opposed to the thin rope. She did like the rotary style dialing.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|He said it best on 60-Minutes when he said he stole from everyone until one day all those bits and pieces started to braid up into something uniquely Buble - Loved this kid when he got started.  Was thrilled at the birth of legendary entertainer, and with this album, he shows he has mastery.  Can't wait for the next concert.  Thanks for staying true to the music and this increadibly beautiful album.  It is both traditional and as fresh as waking up to six inches of new powder! Confection!
1932735410|2.0|Most people cite this book as THE book to prepare for the PMP with.  I want to say that after reading this book along with some others (PMBOK, Heldman, and Head First PMP), I can advise that I wouldn't recommend this as the first or only book in PMP preparation.  Yes, the book is soundly thorough.  However I have two main complaints:  * Rita's Process Chart doesn't mesh well with how PMI and PMBOK have laid out the processes.  Furthermore, she renames and makes up processes, which is completely of no help other than to misdirect someone studying for a test that relies heavily on process order and correct terminology.  * The author (may she rest in peace, but...) is very condescending in her tone to the reader.  She probably states 15-20 times specific items where she basically says 'if you don't understand this or don't already have experience with this, then you have no chance of passing the PMP.'  I'm not sure where she got on her high horse from, but her editor should have toned these down.  We're here to lean and study.  Head First PMP is what I'd recommend to start, and then use Andy Crowe's book to fill in the details/gaps without convolution the PMBOK concepts.

B005K17RU0|5.0|A minor complaint for radar feature is that it shows ground clutter near the radar site.  But at least this app HAS radar view.  Also would be nice if radar recognized pinch/spread  gesture but its workable with buttons.  Other than those nitpicks it seems to work very well.

B005TPCR2U|4.0|Maybe if I had read the book this movie is based on, the movie would not have lived up to it. As it is I experienced the story's poignant insights solely through this movie and they resonate strongly with me. A central message in this movie is that what makes us fall in love with someone doesn't always have to do with what we admire about them. We fall in love with who we are the most equal to.      On the surface, Anne and Jim's characters are opposites but if you think about it they are really more alike than not. One giveaway of this is that Dexter's mother points out how she hates his hosting voice and later Emma recommends against him using that voice on his show.  It's a subtle way of showing that Emma may be different from him on the surface, but underneath she's like Dexter's mother, who he connects with very naturally.  Many of the \\"differences\\" about the two people are due to the fact that Dexter is screwed up. But she sees him for what he can be at his best. This kind of instictive, honest love doesn't enflate our ego, but remains even when we're at our worst (\\"I love you, I just dont LIKE you anymore\\"), giving us the opportunity to be something worthwhile. The other differences are less like differences and more like compliments (She's smart and responsible and he's spontaneous and draws her out).     The choices the two characters make, especially Dexter's, give the movie the suspense it needs. I'm normally lukewarm towards Anne Hathaway but I really thought she fit this part well. She had amazing chemistry with Jim Sturgess and her uncanny ability to look nerdy and childish from one angle and elegant and vulnerable from another worked well for the character. Without giving the ending away, I felt like the screenwriters gave us enough movie after the \\"major plot twist\\" to deal with the emotions it caused. It left you with a better feeling than you imagined you could have.  I'm totally bewildered that this movie isn't more popular :)

B005Z271Y6|5.0|Sidelined recently by throat surgery, Adele released this terrific 100 minute concert filmed earlier this year in London.  Far be it from me to be critical of any of her songs or of her.  She may be the first musical artist that my ex-wives and I all agree on.  Adele has an amazing voice and is able to write equally amazing heartfelt songs.  This isn't unique to her obviously, but Adele manages to make the audience realize these are snippets from her life and often her hurt shows.  In previous live performances that I've seen, Adele always comes across nervous and a bit shy and overwhelmed.  Not here.  Complete with a fellow Brit, Dusty Springfield bouffant, she seems amazed at her success but approachable, all at the same time.  Her interaction with the fans between songs is sometimes profane and pretty funny.  You won't find much new with respect to the songs if you know Adele's recorded work.  All but two are on her two previous albums.  She adds Nashville's Steeldrivers' \\"If It Hadn't Been for Love\\" and a tearful cover of Bonnie Raitt's classic \\"I Can't Make You Love Me.\\" The picture on this Blu ray is excellent as you would expect, but the editing and directing is choppy as is often the case these days.  I'm all for audience shots, but they should be longer than 2 microseconds if you want to convey something other than a headache.<br /><br /> Because of Adele's voice timbre, I noticed it became a bit shrill during certain songs while listening in the DTS-HD setting.  In that surround mode, her voice is very upfront in the center channel.  When I engaged the Dolby Digital 2-channel option all was well.  You may have to adjust your center channel or just go with the stereo mode.  This package includes a CD of all the songs without the chit chat.  An excellent package.

B0036TGSJ4|3.0|I tend to shy away from most teen comedies, but this one is a reminder of the John Hughes classics of yore.  Smartly written, well acted and funny.  Sure, as usual, the California high school depicted in this film has many \\"yeah right...\\" moments but even with a pretty stupid premise, it comes off smart.  Emma Stone is adorable as a chaste teen that takes one lie about a sexual liaison and makes a profession out of similar ones with various classmates.  She even goes so far as to wear a scarlet letter on her chest, ala Hester Prynne.  As is predictable, her actions have more serious consequences.  Olive's (Stone) parents are played by Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson.  They are fun to watch.  I would have liked to have seen more.  As it is, this movie stands out in the genre.

B00003CX9E|5.0|Considered by many to be the greatest American film of all time, it's taken me nearly 10 years to see it again.  I had been contemplating replacing my \\"remastered\\" 60th anniversary edition with the Blu ray version.  Being an active collector of films, this is a decision that comes up often.  When it comes to video tape and even laser discs, it's a pretty easy decision.  But should you automatically upgrade your DVD's to Blu ray.  If you have a limited budget, the answer isn't always yes.<br /><br /> I can add little to the evaluations of thousands of critics, both professional and amateur, regarding the quality of the film itself.  While watching it this time around, I was amazed at the time and effort given to the makeup.  Several characters in the film including Orson Welles' Charles Foster Kane, age over several decades as the reporter allows them to reminisce in a series of flashbacks.  Given the technology of 1940, the art is at its highest in this film.  Kane in fact, begins the film as a dying old man, but the story quickly reverts to his time as a boy growing up in Colorado.  His parents decide that he should grow up in a more cultured environment so they send him off to boarding school after the discovery of silver on their property.  Eventually Kane becomes involved in newspaper publishing which leads to great wealth and politics.  The last words Kane spoke as he slipped away was \\"Rosebud\\".  The reporter is charged with discovering who or what Rosebud was.  This leads to the various interviews with important people in Kane's life.  Technically and artistically the film is a marvel.  The acting is top notch and all performers came from Welles' Mercury troupe.  In particular look for an excellent performance from Dorothy Comingore as Kane's second wife, singer Susan Alexander.  She has a wide range in emotions to portray in addition to various chronological ages.<br /><br />This edition of \\"Citizen Kane\\" includes the documentary \\"The Battle Over Citizen Kane\\" which is a fascinating film itself.  It was no secret Welles was using William Randolph Hearst as his model for Kane and California's San Simeon for Florida's Xanadu.  Hearst wasn't happy about it and did all he could to destroy the film and Welles.  I watched the DVD on a Blu ray player that upconverts/upscales the DVD to \\"near Blu ray\\" quality.  Does it?  Well, the operative word is \\"near\\" and for me and for this remastered, black and white, mono audio film, its close enough.nating film itself.

1932907009|5.0|There's a whole cottage industry that has built up around helping people write screenplays, most of which will never be finished, and even fewer of which will be read by anyone who matters, and yet an even more minuscule percentage will ever be made into a movie.  It's a pipe dream of many people, and many authors and seminar leaders are there to fleece the wannabes and blow smoke with all kinds of gimmicks and b.s.  You might think that Blake Snyder, who wrote \\"Stop or My Mom Will Shoot!\\" and \\"Blank Check\\", not the most acclaimed films cinema has to offer, might not be a guy you should learn from.  But you would be wrong.  He was a working writer and quite successful.  I've read nearly everyone's books on screenwriting and the only writers I recommend on the subject are Syd Field, William Goldman, and Blake Snyder.  Blake Snyder builds on what Syd Field teaches, elaborates, simplifies, and adds more \\"working writer\\" insight.  Besides all that, the book is very well written and enjoyable to read even if you never finish your screenplay.  Forget most of the scammers and hype artist.  Go with Syd Field, Blake Synder, and William Goldman.  Read all the free pdf copies of screenplays available on the web.  Then get to work.  Good luck!

Oh, and there is some good piano playing as well.  Gould seems like he was an interesting, if not a little strange, person.  It's sad that he died so young of a stroke.

1451629184|5.0|I'm sure most of you know about Jaycee Lee Dugard, who was kidnapped at age 11, in 1991. She was finally rescued after 18 years, in 2009. While on her way to school, just minutes from her home, Phillip Garrido, and his wife, Nancy, kidnapped her off the street and shoved them into their vehicle. For 18 years, they kept Jaycee hidden in their backyard and brainwashed her into thinking it would be unsafe if she ever tried to leave. They wouldn't even let her speak her real name. They made her dependent on them both physically and emotionally, and even made Jaycee feel empathy for them. Phillip also repeatedly forced Jaycee to have sexual relations with him, and she gave birth to his two daughters while in captivity, the first at age 14.<br /><br />I believe that this memoir is the first time Jaycee has spoken at great length about her 18 year ordeal. I cannot even begin to fathom what she went through. While reading her story, I couldn't even imagine something like this had really happened, but it did. It sickens me that the man who ruined her entire life is the father of her children. It also sickens me that Phillip made the girls refer to Nancy as their mother, and Jaycee as their sister. The Garrido's are truly disturbed and twisted people and I hope they get what they deserve in jail.<br /><br />This story is heartbreaking, disturbing, and worst of all, true. I highly recommend it. Everyone should know the truth about what this poor girl endured, and who better to hear it from then Jaycee herself? I am so happy she is working towards taking her life back. This story is a true testimony to what the human spirit can endure when faced with the unthinkable.

1463514581|4.0|Rose Gardner is a naive 24 year old Southern girl with psychic-like visions of the future. One day while working, she sees a vision of herself... dead! Only... it's her nasty and abusive momma that ends up dead that night instead of her. Realizing that she isn't going to live forever, and that her vision may still come true in just a few short days, Rose makes a list on the back of a Wal-Mart receipt of 28 things she wants to do before she dies. These include things like playing in the rain, kissing a man, and doing \\"more\\" with a man. Before she can make a dent in her list though, Rose becomes the prime suspect in her momma's murder. Rose quickly realizes someone is after her, believing she has something that they want, and they will do anything to get it - including kill again. When her house gets broken into, her sexy new neighbor, Joe, comes to the rescue. Now, Rose must clear her name, stay away from the dangerous killers, complete her list, and figure out her growing emotions for Joe, who has a few secrets of his own!<br /><br />Such a fun Southern mystery with a lovable and adorable heroine! I loved Rose. Even though she is 24 years old, you'd definitely think otherwise. Her momma sheltered her for her entire life and Rose is severely lacking in life experience. Having never kissed a man or drank alcohol, Rose promptly adds these to her list of things to complete before her impending death at the end of the week and Joe is happy to help. Her list also includes things like dancing, getting a cell phone and cable TV, as well as a dog. Her list demonstrates just how much she has been sheltered and how much she has yet to live. Her naivety, while silly, is actually quite endearing. I also loved her Southern charm, and loved the dialogue throughout the novel. Oh, how I wish I had a Southern accent...<br /><br />The mystery was fun and surprising, the romance was a roller coaster ride also full of mystery, and the main character was funny and charming. If you like Southern novels and mysteries with humor, this is definitely the book for you! I am really looking forward to the next book in the series, and I already miss Rose, so hurry up and write, Denise. :) Haha!<br /><br />My only problem was that there were some grammatical errors/typos, which could easily be cleaned up and edited, so I did not let that deter me from my enjoyment of the story!<br /><br />Note: I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.nd mysteries with humor, this is definitely the book for you!

B0034G4OQS|4.0|Have you ever wondered how it is possible for Santa Claus to have existed since the beginning of time, travel to every child's home in the world in one night, be able to carry all the presents for every child in the world in one sleigh, climb down chimney's and all the while remain unseen? \\"Arthur Christmas\\" explains it all. When a young British child named Gwen poses all these questions and asks for a particular gift for Christmas, the story of Arthur begins.<br /><br />Arthur is the second in line to be the next Santa. He works in the Christmas card division of a massive operation that exists on an equally massive spaceship that houses millions of elves and is quite simply perfect. Although on this night, the operation isn't perfect, there is one child that has been missed. Her gift has been lost in the shuffle. Gwen's bicycle was never delivered. So when Santa and Arthur's brother Steve decide that going back to deliver that one present, to that one child, isn't worth the risk of being detected or something going wrong, Arthur resorts to unorthodox measures to make sure that one child isn't disappointed when she wakes in the morning.<br /><br />\\"Arthur Christmas\\" is an active science fiction technological fun house of events. The ideas and thoughts that went into how Santa can possibly master all of these impossible tasks every Christmas Eve are fun and inventive. It is a light-hearted and perfect movie for anybody wanting to get into the Christmas spirit and it came to the theatres at a perfect time. It isn't a movie with explosive laughs and it mostly plays out like an action movie that is trying to be funny.<br /><br />\\"Arthur Christmas\\" isn't going to be a classic Christmas movie that everybody is going to want to see every Christmas like \\"Rudolph\\", \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" or \\"Christmas Vacation\\", but for the time being, it's a nice little movie with all the right heart strings and enough creativity to be a memorable Christmas movie for this Christmas, 2011.

1400032717|4.0|Christopher Boone is an autistic 15-year-old living with his father, Ed Boone, in Swindon, England. He despised the color yellow, dislikes being touched, and is gifted in math. As far as he knows, his mother died of a heart problem 2 years earlier. At the start of the book, Christopher finds Eileen Shears' black poodle, Wellington, dead in her front yard, and he sets out to solve the mystery. As Christopher said, \\"Lots of things are mysteries. But that doesn't mean there isn't an answer to them.\\" When his father finds out what Christopher's up to, he tells him that he needs to cease his investigating, and Christopher promises to do so. However, he ends up breaking his promise, and while searching for information about Wellington, Mrs. Alexander tells him some shocking information about his mother, prior to her untimely death. Surprised and hurt, Christopher just wants to be alone. Throughout Christopher's adventures, he had been writing a book about everything that has happened to him. When his father finds the book, he reads it and confiscates it. Christopher searches for the book when his father isn't home and stumbles upon a series of letters in father's cupboard. When secrets are spilled, Christopher sets of on a journey. As the story unfolds, tension rises, and mysteries are solved. This eye-opening, yet satisfyingly puzzling novel is well written and sure to capture the hearts of all those who read it. The first paragraph was very descriptive, and it made me want to continue reading. This book personally gave me a new view towards adults and how they can be immature and childish at times. I loved the way the book was laid out through Christopher's perspective. I think anyone who loves to read should read this book, because I guarantee, they will be hooked immediately.

0156027321|4.0|I would recommend this book to people who have a lot of time on their hands. The beginning where Pi is talking about religion is more than a little slow and made me want to just give up on the book all together. But once you get to part two the book gets a lot better. When Pi gets thrown out of the boat in to a lifeboat he starts to have to depend on himself. Being only a kid it is surprising how long he lasted on the boat, especially with a tiger.  The rest of us probably would have died of hunger or have been eaten by the animals. Pi shows how having background knowledge and a positive attitude can save us in dire situations. Since he was the son of a zookeeper, he knew exactly how to handle the problems he was faced with. The end of the book shows us how the mind copes with things that we can't handle. By the last page I felt like I knew Pi personally and he was one of the bravest people I had ever read about or met. So this book is great for everyone, as long as you can get past the beginning.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I really do have a thing for artistic collaborations, especially if it involves 2 known artists who's work have been appreciated and praised by a majority of people. Whether its Music or Movies, sometimes we really get a surprising result!!...LABYRINTH....is  definitely one of those classics !!!<br /><br />Jim Henson was mostly known for bringing us kids classics like SESAME STREET, THE MUPPET SHOW and FRAGGLE ROCK to name a few....he left us with unique classics over the years that pretty much all the kids know by now, even for us that are now older, we can still remember those old kids show. Some of them are still running strong on TV and now its our kids turn to taste a little bit of that magic!!!!!<br /><br />George Lucas of course is known for his fantasy/sc.fiction movies like  STAR WARS, INDIANA JONES and WILLOW.... He is a well respected producer/screenwriter and director and is movies are still acclaimed by millions every time they come on the big screen, usually generating lots of profit at the box office.<br /><br />LABYRINTH is exactly what we have here, i would say its a perfect match between Jim Henson's world and George Lucas way of bringing fantasy to life!!..kinda like FRAGGLE ROCK meets STAR WARS  but its a whole different  world....<br />The movie is about Sarah (Jennifer Connelly). She likes fairy tales and romantic plays a lot and often acts like she's the heroine of her stories, trying to actually act the way they would.... One thing she don't like very much though is babysitting ! After her parents ask her to baby sit one more time, Sarah find herself stuck to take care of her baby brother again! After reciting one of the lines in her goblin story asking for the goblins to take away her baby brother, the baby actually disappears for real. The goblin king (David Bowie) than comes and explain to sarah that her baby brother is now in his castle,by her fault, which is in the middle of a huge labyrinth. Sarah will have to go and try to find her way in the middle of the labyrinth if she wants to save her baby brother....<br /><br />The movie is an amazing ride!!!.. The labyrinth itself is extremely well done!!!...full of interesting creatures, and secret passages. On her journey to save her brother in the labyrinth, Sarah will meet different creatures on the way....some wanting to help her...some wanting her to fail..... George lucas did an amazing job bringing Jim henson's creatures to life!!!!..This remastered version is also excellent!!! You would think this was shot last years and not in 1986!!!! I would  strongly recommend this movie for everyone who haven't seen it!!!.. It is a real fantasy classic that the whole family can enjoy, no matter how old you are!!!  If you don't get it for you than get it for your kids.....they'll dig this!!!!!!<br /><br />ENJOY!!!!!she wants to save her baby brother....  The movie is an amazing ride!!!..

I would  strongly recommend this movie for everyone who haven't seen it!!!.. It is a real fantasy classic that the whole family can enjoy, no matter how old you are!!!  If you don't get it for you than get it for your kids.....they'll dig this!!!!!!  ENJOY!!!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is great for when you need to quote verses that Christians would find offensive. It is a fact that atheists are more familiar with the Bible than Christians. Keep it that way, and keep talking about it.

B005342N58|1.0|I think they simply forgot how to write catchy melodies, and may have started using manatees to write their lyrics.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I am using this as my go-to keyboard on my rooted Droid Incredible 2 and just love it. It has two modes, and I use the &quot;precise&quot; mode, which makes suggestions based not only on the characters typed, but the context in which I've typed them.  Drawing from my SMS logs and address book,  some of the suggestions are uncanny - type in two letters of a 10 character word,  even misspelled, and get the right word in the blue box. Amazing technology.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I stopped counting how many I have tried and never really found what I was looking for until this one.
B004EPZ06Q|1.0|This is not a review of the movie at all since I was really looking forward to purchasing this once it came out on Blu-ray.  I can't believe this studio is trying to push this UltraViolet junk on everyone!!  I will never purchase a movie that has this technology and am very disappointed to see The Hangover II as the next movie that has this.  Please bring back the Digital Copy!!!
B0038WCC62|2.0|This product is not virgin material, and sounds dirty even just after openning, this is sad because the songs are outstanding, but no only the transfer is awful but the material made is not virgin. do not buy this item, it is better to buy in cd.
B00631VJIC|5.0|Love this soundtrack! Thank you Kurt Sutter for giving us something to get us through until Season 5. Like another reviewer I wish \\"Mary\\" would have been included. Every time I hear that song I am reminded of Gemma's story and tears well up in my eyes. This show is by far the best show on television and this CD is going to all of my family members for Christmas who love SOA. LOVE \\"John the Revelator\\" and \\"Hey Hey, My My.\\" When can we get another one? Rock on Kurt and keep up the brilliant writing!

B0029XFNA8|1.0|I have a collection of over 1000 DVDs and Blu rays.I'm trying to switch over to Blu ray when i can. I have found that the older movies are magnificent on Blu ray. Casablanca, Ben Hur, the 10 Commandments etc. are all wonderful, Blu ray brings out the best in films except for Miracle on 34Th Street. I just viewed it and it looks like i was watching a VHS film. It was dark, brownish and not pleasant to watch. I recommend buying the DVD and leaving the Blu ray alone as far as this movie goes. Its to bad, i was looking forward to something much better.
1932735410|5.0|I have had access to each edition of this book since the Fourth Edition, and essentialy every PMP prep book published since 2004. As someone who would absolutely know, I can tell you this is not only the best PMP book RMC has published thus far, but the best PMP prep guide on the market right now. And for me, it's not even close. Unlike the rest of the PMP guides out there, which simply present information from the PMBOK Guide in a slightly different format, Rita figures out ways to boil down critical exam concepts into real world applications and scenarios. Which makes Rita's book user-friendly, interactive, and valuable as a resource long after students pass the exam. People who teach PMP classes for a living or for their companies understand the true value of this book. I certainly do.  Regarding the previous review...Rita was admittedly a very direct person, whether she was teaching or writing or speaking. Anyone who ever met her knows this, and I had the pleasure of spending time with Rita on about a half-dozen occasions. Rita's co-author for this new edition (Laurie Diethelm) has made a wonderful effort to soften Rita's tone, which I admit was not for everyone. In fact, most (if not all) of the sections the previous reviewer refers to have been completely re-written. The result of Rita and Laurie's joint contributions is a great book--both in tone and content. Clearly this person is either reviewing a previous edition, or has another agenda (I am always wary of negative reviews that so specifically recommend other books...)  And finally, one caveat for people in the market for a PMP prep guide: in case you hadn't heard, nearly one-third of the PMP exam changed this past September. As far as I can tell, this book is the only one that has been updated so far. Do NOT buy any book that was published before June of 2011!
B0041TM3LA|5.0|Very good quality, and a good value...the cd's were cheaper than if I purchased it via itunes..plus others can now use the cd's too...I would highly recommend this purchase
143911000X|5.0|\\"Whether we know it or not, each of us lives a life governed by an internalized code of conduct. Some call it morality. Others call it religion. I call it \\"the Bro Code.\\" It is my hope that, with a better understanding of the Bro Code, Bros the world over can put aside their differences and strengthen the bonds of brotherhood. It is then, and only then, that we might work together as one to accomplish perhaps the most important challenge society faces - getting laid.\\" - Barney Stinson, HIMYM.<br /><br />How can anyone read this and not find it LEGEND-waitforit-DARY?<br /><br />I honestly didn't even know that the Bro Code existed on paper, until I happened to find the book - not even at a bookstore - but a general media store. Upon spotting it, I immediately (and excitedly) bought it, and knew exactly what to expect - a dash of humor, with a pinch of wit and lots of laughter. This is obviously a book not meant to be taken too seriously, as I noticed some reviewers have. It is a book meant to make you laugh (at least smile), while successfully endorsing the show and the character.<br /><br />The Bro Code is what Barney believes is a man's bible. And should not - for whatever reason - be broken, or you will face a series of penalties as found in Section 7 of the book under Violations.<br /><br />Read this book at your own peril. But be prepared for lots of cringe-worthy funny moments.
0321704452|4.0|This book is a must read for anyone, who has to deliver presentations. One of the important points which I liked about the book was the way it was presented starting with a story about why naked. When one starts with a story in a presentation, the audience will be receptive, one can be a bit relaxed and the nervousness could be reduced. The idea about starting with a PUNCH (personal, unexpected, novel, challenging and humorous) was interesting. I learned that visual presentations should be simple and limit the number of slides. One should use some photos, videos or graphics and have some white space in between.   While watching a presentation in my office recently, I realized the importance of not reading all that was written on the slides. It gives an impression to the audience that the presenter does not know the subject well.  I also liked the part about being dressed a level above the audience, having good eye contacts, keeping it simple and conversational, avoiding slide shows if possible and to be prepared with technology issues. The use of presentation given by Steve Jobs as example was impressive in the book.  Overall it is a wonderful book to keep it handy always.

Oh, and Mrs. Danvers has got to be one of the lamest beloved villains in all of literature...why the hell didn't they just give her the sack several times over?<br /><br />The whole thing was rather boring, absurd, and pointless.

B0058YPG1G|5.0|Breaking Bad is not \\"One of the Best TV Series Ever\\".... because it is hands down THE absolute best TV series EVER.  I got hooked after it had been playing on AMC for about a half a season.  I went back and found the first few episodes on-line, got caught up to date, and have been a loyal watcher and fan ever since.  It has just the right amount of drama and comedy while actually being believable.  Many TV shows are entertaining, but you just know it could never happen.  I would not be surprised to pick up the paper and read about a story similar to the Breaking Bad plotline.  Also, not one of the characters is over the top perfect or evil; they're just like the people in the real world we live in.  Just \\"normal\\" people living extraordinary lives due to bizarre situations.

1451648537|5.0|I sincerely recommend the book. It is incredible how Steve Jobs' life was amazing. The most notorious thing for me was that it seems that he truly wanted everybody to know his complete life, without leaving behind any dark stories. Although it took a enormous time for the book to get here, almost one and a half month, but i recommend it.

B0055V6EZE|5.0|I had the fortune of discovering this album while out at Target.  Having been a fan of Hugh Laurie for many years, I've been aware of his singing/piano talent for some time, and I was curious to see what he would have to offer in this album.<br /><br />This album is, straight up, a love letter to both blues and popular Louisiana tunes.  Laurie's enthusiasm for the subject matter is evident in every note played and every lyric sung.  As a native of Louisiana, I can honestly say that it blows my mind for an Englishman to have more soul than some of the singers found in the bars on Bourbon Street.  But then again, this is also just another reason why Hugh Laurie rocks.  He's never made any secret of his love for good music and his own pursuits in sharing it with the rest of the world.<br /><br />At the time of this writing, I can't even say that I have a favorite on the album so far.  Every track is good, plain and simple.  However, I did realize that I had a winner in terms of purchase when Laurie's vocals begin for \\"St. James Infirmary.\\"  The piano intro is undoubtedly good, but it was the opening vocals that let me know that I had made a good purchase.  Everything about this album is true to form.<br /><br />If you are a fan of good blues and piano, this album is a must-have.  I look forward to buying more of Laurie's work in the near future.

1451627289|5.0|I love Stephen King. With a few exceptions, I like almost everything he ever wrote. I love the continuity of his stories--characters, places, and things all popping in and out of various books in his career. Every new story is like listening to an old friend. I think he cultivates that feeling, and his Constant Readers find it one of the more endearing things about reading his books--at least I do.  Aside from that, he tells great stories!  I wasn't sure about this one. I mean how the heck is a novel about the Kennedy assassination going to satisfy King's typical audience? I won't rehash the story line, but trust me when I tell you that you will not be disappointed. This is a superb story from start to finish. If you are new to Stephen King, this is a great introduction. If you are a Constant Reader, you'll be hooked in that familiar way that you love within just a few minutes, if not from the very first words, and the entertainment will last until long after it's over.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Not a big reader but i got this book and loved it from the go complete page turner now ive bought the second[[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]] and look forward to the third! [[ASIN:0439023513 Mockingjay (The Hunger Games, Book 3)]]
B001QTXM5Y|4.0|I have never read the comic so wasn't sure what to expect when I watched the Watchmen, but it has an interesting plot with a pretty good twist at the end. It is a dark movie though... really dark compared to other comic book movie fare... and it is more of a drama, than an action movie. So if you go in expecting a \\"good guys\\" beating up \\"bad guys\\" movie, you'll most likely be disappointed.<br /><br />I'm not really sure how much the Director's Cut adds to the movie. The only thing I noticed was some instances of gratuitous explicit violence, such as Rorschach's encounter with the child molester... I don't know if explicitly showing what happens adds anything to the movie.<br /><br />ONE WARNING WHEN ORDERING THIS FROM AMAZON: If you order from one of the \\"Fulfilled by Amazon\\" sellers rather than Amazon directly, you may end up with a non-US version of the movie. I think I ended up with a Canadian copy of the movie (all the English text on the front cover seemed to have a corresponding French translation). You will most likely get it at a cheaper price... but don't be surprised what you end up getting.

B0002F6AH0|4.0|I got this DVD recently and started to watch it.  I really love this series and was pleased with the quality of the documentary.

It should have been included to get users an option to display subtitles.  Nevertheless, I am very happy with it.
B004EPYZT4|1.0|The one positive was Bulgaria's low cost but effectively created settings. The negatives were as follows:  The same old stolen/copied storyline of a search for the all-powerful relic (looks suspiciously like the Alien face parasite) which, in ancient times, was taken from one evil person then broken into pieces and dispersed around the world. Now being found and assembled (some how) by a new despot to again (boring!) wreck havoc upon the world. The rest of the movie is a lot of really bad sword play of slicing and dicing through the bad guys. Also tossed in are a few upper nude females and one only slightly ambiguous sex scene. Well, they did need something to capture the viewer's attention! Acting was robotic, unemotional, and along with the Americanized slanged dialogue it had a TV reality show feel. Even the costumes and props had that same stereotypic Hollywood fabricated plastic look that has been resurrected every decade for the past hundred years.   Recommendation: If they don't need the money, the writers and director should go back to their respective schools to gather some hints on creativity or learn another profession.

I usually have a hard time sitting through a whole movie and being engaged in it the whole time.  This film wasn't what I would call deeply moving or anything that substantial, but it was indeed interesting.  It didn't spend a lot of time explaining stuff as it was happening.  Big gaps of time would pass and you had to spend a minute or so realizing that and what had happened in between.  I wouldn't exactly call it a \\"character study\\", but more of a \\"people-study\\" perhaps.  There are four main characters and none of them are given preference over the other.  I suppose some of the intrigue that keeps the film interesting is that throughout the film each of the four leads is going through an emotional crisis, wanting to be CLOSER to someone.  During each scene, you see the yearning's perspective, and you kind of root for them to get what they want.  At the same time, in some instances, one wonders if the yearning even knows what he/she really wants.<br />  For those wanting an erotic film, don't be fooled by the MPAA's description of their rating.  Aside from some clinical images of a strip club, the porn-lingo is about the only thing \\"explicit\\" about the film.  None of the leads show any skin.  I suppose that was part of the intrigue, but part of me kinda figured by halfway through the movie, when Clive Owen's head kept blocking Natalie Portman's exposure, that the director didn't want the cast to show their moneymakers, but, rather, the audience to focus on the emotional and philosophical aspects of the sexual content.  And as I said, it wasn't that moving, but...maybe a new genre should be created: romantic suspense?
B004EPZ0AM|3.0|Director:  George Miller<br />Writers:  George Miller, Gary Eck, Warren Coleman, Paul Livingston<br /><br />Happy Feet Two, a sequel to the 2006 film Happy Feet, is something of a mixed bag.  On the one hand it is, like the original, a masterful feat of CGI animation in the way it portrays in stunning detail both the animal characters and the stark beauty of the Antarctic and aquatic environments they live in.  But on the other hand, unlike the original, the story is a near-incoherent mess of multiple meandering plot threads and, quite frankly, too many characters.  Given that it was directed by George Miller and written by Miller, Gary Eck, Warren Coleman and Paul Livingston, most of whom were involved in the directing and writing of the first film, it is something of a puzzle as to why the story-telling side of things fell so far short this time around.<br /><br />The plot:  Mumble (Elijah Wood) and Gloria (voiced this time around by Pink) now have a young son named Erik (Ava Acres) who's reluctant to dance and who, when encouraged to try by Mumble, ends up falling flat on his face in front of the whole Emperor penguin community and is humiliated. Erik then runs away - along with his two best friends Boadicia (Meibh Campbell) and Atticus (Lil P-Nut) - with Ramon (Robin Williams) who has decided to return to his original home of Adele-land.  When they reach Adele-land, they find that much has changed.  The Adele penguin community is now under the god-like leadership of a strange-looking penguin (actually a puffin pretending to be a penguin) named The Mighty Sven (Hank Azaria) who can fly!  Lovelace (Robin Williams again) who met Sven when both were rescued by a Russian trawler, acts as his prophet, proclaiming to all and sundry the miraculous history and powers of The Mighty Sven and the philosophy of Sven-Think (\\"If you want it, you must will it. If you will it, it will be yours.\\")<br /><br />From here on, the plot threads and characters involved only multiply and grow more inter-tangled. Mumble goes to Adele-land to bring back Erik and his friends, only to find Erik doesn't want to leave his hero, The Mighty Sven.  Ramon pursues a female penguin named Carmen (Sofia Vergara) who wants nothing to do with him, but Sven convinces Ramon to believe in himself and his destiny. The scene then abruptly switches to underwater where we meet two kirll - Will the Krill (Brad Pitt) and Bill the Krill (Matt Damon), who are part of a huge swarm of millions of krill but who decide to leave because Will believes there is cosmic  meaning to be found beyond the swarm.  Back on the surface, a sudden splitting of glacial ice disrupts Emperor-land and traps the Emperor penguin community in a high-walled canyon of ice, cutting them off from the ocean and hence from their food supply.  Erik and his friends begin their return with Mumble to Emperor-land, but only because Sven urged him to.  Along the way, they encounter an aggressive bull elephant seal, Bryan the Beach Master (Richard Carter), and his two pups, who refuses to back up to let them pass across a narrow ice bridge, but events lead to Mumble rescuing Bryan and Bryan swearing that he owes Mumble a favor.  When they finally reach Emperor-land, they find that they cannot reach the now-trapped Emperor penguin community.  As Mumble and Erik try to find a way to save the trapped penguins from starvation, the scenes go back and forth between Emperor penguins, Adele penguins, Mumble, Erik, Ramon, Lovelace, Sven, Will and Bill, Bryan and the seal herd, with some humans and a flock of menacing skua (basically sea vultures) added into the mix for good measure.  Sound jumbled and thrown together?  It is.<br /><br />As is the singing and dancing.  The original Happy Feet had singing and dancing, but there was a seamless continuity to it all and everything flowed.  Here, it feels like they threw in everything but the kitchen sink (and they even do that at one point when Erik launches into an operaticaria about his father) with the result that there's no flow and no unifying theme. Instead, the film feels like it's constantly veering off into new directions, none of which is ever followed up on.  If there is a unifying theme - other than the obvious environmental one and the usual heavy-handed messages of 'Be Yourself!\\" and \\"Everyone needs to work together!\\" - it's insecurity.  Erik's insecurity about fitting into the community.  Mumble's insecurity about being a father.  Ramon's insecurity about finding a mate.  Sven's insecurity about not being accepted if the others find out he's not a penguin.  Will's insecurity at finding out krill are at the bottom of the food chain, and Bill's insecurity about not being part of a swarm.  And Bryan's insecurity of what will happen to him if the other seals find out he backed up for a penguin.  Which pretty much sums up the core problem with Happy Feet Two - it's an insecure movie that isn't sure just what it wants to be.<br /><br />To be fair, I fear that I'm making the film sound worse than it actually is, which is not my intention.  Happy Feet Two is not a bad film at all.  In point of fact, the individual pieces of it are all quite good.  I particularly liked the scenes with Will and Bill, which in addition to being stunningly animated were also pretty funny and the most likely to appeal to adult viewers, especially ones who enjoy delightfully painful puns like the one in the exchange where Will cries \\"I want to be free!\\" and Bill replies \\"There's no such thing as free, Will.\\"  But put them all together and what you end up with is a jumble, a case where the whole is actually less than the sum of the parts.  Much as I liked the Will and Bill scenes, you could in fact have cut all of them out and it wouldn't have affected the main story line at all.<br /><br />I would still recommend Happy Feet Two.  Children will probably not have too much of a problem with the meandering plot threads, though they may make the film too long for smaller children.  And as I said, the CGI animation is extremely well done.  I just wish that they had thought a bit more on the screenplay before making the movie.  This is definitely a case where less would have been more.t there's no flow and no unifying theme.

0920236162|1.0|This book cost too much for what was offered - short, short story, slim, slim paperback. I disliked that the Princess heroine, Elizabeth, telling her fiance that he was a bum.  Another issue is the message that I perceive of this story.  Others may perceive a different message but mine is offered here as part of my review of this book.  While the princess has character traits of wit, tenacity, and willpower, she insults the prince at the end which is unkind. It appears that this book was written decades ago. I never read it as a child & it was not popular when my children were growing up.  The message of triumph over adversity did not include a cautionary element several decades ago when children like me could roam around the neighborhood unsupervised and be safe.  There are dangers today to young people that no degree of cleverness, tenacity, willpower or wit can eradicate. It is unlikely that truly dangerous foes will render themselves exhausted trying to \\"prove\\" to a victim that they are strong, powerful or fearless.  A fantasy or fairy tale usually imparts a morale or message through its story, but the one I perceived from this story was not one that I care to reinforce.<br /><br />I edited my review for clarity since someone commented that it was voted the least helpful one about this book. I was not trying to win helpful votes by my review - I was just giving my honest impression & opinion.
B005DOKIYG|1.0|The cover is OK but not what was expected for a $29 purchase. This is a $5 item (max) made in China! It does not fold out into a wallet, meaning you have to unzip to remove and zip to enclose and the material is of cheap quality. Look elsewhere, there is much better product available.

B005D0RDIE|5.0|I have seen many live videos before, but none of them have been like this! What a show the Canadian power trio puts on. This video has the amazing audience of Rush in Rio, and the quality of R30 and Snakes and Arrows Live. It all starts out with the humorous intro during the tour that reviews the history of a Canadian band named Rash. Then exploding on the stage with The Spirit of Radio the band and crowd are in perfect sync. Second is Time Stand Still which is what you what time to do while watching this DVD. The first set continues with songs old and new including old favorite Freewill and with drum fills that may even top Tom Sawyer the new BU2B. The second set includes all of Moving Pictures, Caravan, a Neil Peart drum solo, Closer to the Heart, 2112, and Far Cry. For the encore they play La Villa Strangiato and Working Man (My favorite version of it so far.) So as you can see if you are a huge fan of Rush or have just heard some of their songs on the radio this is a good investment of 3 hours and $20.

B003ZHVJFK|5.0|Pretty good movie. Kind of reminded me of the original mortal kombat movie that came out in the 90's. Couple things that would have been nice is if they had several more characters from the first couple tekken's such as \\"king\\" and \\"paul\\".  I you're looking for a movie with lots of action on a friday night this is your movie.
0811879542|5.0|This book looks really fun!  I haven't read it to any children yet, but it fascinated myself and two other adults when it arrived.  The book has very simmple words and invites the reader to interact with it. It starts with one simple yellow dot, with the instruction \\"Press Here.\\" And as you go through the book, the dots multiply, change color, move, and get larger and smaller. As an adult, you know the picture is going to change when you turn the page, even if you don't follow the instructions; you can't help but to do what it says anyway, even if you are not reading it with a child.   As a \\"science person\\" I enjoyed the simple illustrations of cause-and-effect relationships, and this book could provide an effectve way to engage young children in learning these concepts. For early childhood educators, this book would be a great supplement to a math or science curriculum, or a way to combine science and math concepts with literature.  The book also has a very sturdy cover, similar to board books.  The pages are not cardboard, but they made from thick coated paper, like an art book, and should hold up well.  I bought this book as a gift for someone who works with 2 and 3 year olds.  The text and illustrations seem simple enough for that age, yet enjoyable for older children and adults as well.  This would be a great book to read together as a family, or for an older child to read with a younger child.

So basically, I paid the additional money for a digital copy that had expired in April, 2011.  I am very disappointed that Amazon.com did not disclose this information.  I think that they should not even sell the digital copy version since it's expired.  I am usually quite satisfied with my purchases from Amazon.com, but this was a huge disappointment.
030746363X|5.0|I've been doing this for a year now.  The first four weeks I lost about 5-6 pounds.  This was doing the absolute minimum as well as the binge day.  I really like the slow carb diet for the winter months where I tend to really slack off.  At a minimum this program helped me maintain my fit appearance until I could pick up my work outs in the spring.  Bravo!  PS after a year I've put on about 10-15 pounds of lean muscle mass.  I'm not a big eater and can't really handle the weight gain program so my weight gain is much slower, but it's been working great for me and I spend about 20 minutes 3-4 times a week working out (2X kettlebell, 2X muscle mass routine). I've also tried the fish oil regimen, does wonders for my hair and skin and helps me look younger.  All of these supplements certainly add up, but if you don't have the time, then spend the money and use all that free time to enjoy life with your fit body :-)

This is the best game we've gotten this year!

B005OCFGTO|5.0|I love the Harry Potter movies, but have watched most of them on TV. I have purchased a couple of them. I decided to order the set with all 8 movies. I was disappointed when I watched the first 2 and some of the scenes were missing. Some were just short parts left out some were longer, such as Harry watching Malfoy Sr selling his illegal items in The Chamber of Secrets. Someone never having see the movies wouldn't miss these scenes but I really noticed then and it really bugged me. Is this the case for all copies of these movies or just the ones in this gift set?

B004U52VPS|4.0|[[ASIN:B004U52VPS Angry Birds: Knock On Wood Game]]The game can be quite entertaining, but it takes practice to determine how to aim and how much force to use.  It also takes some experimentation to figure out what type of surface, table, etc. to use, as a table that is too small isn't really workable.  Once we got going, with three players, it was actually quite a challenge getting it set up over and over.  The one thing that should have been included is a diagram of what goes where when putting it away.  It's much easier if you take careful notes when you unpack it, but who thinks of that the first time, and after that it's too late, unless you are present at someone else's house with their new set and armed with that knowledge.  I actually bought two of these, one to keep at home and one for a granddaughter in another town.
B004EPYZQ2|4.0|I would've given it a 5/5 stars but the acting could have been a little stronger. The plot is real great though, it's not your typical movie. I LOVE JJ Abrams' Lost and Sci-Fi as a general genre of movies/books. Spielberg and Abrams do not disappoint. Great for ALL ages.

0321543726|5.0|I have used this book to teach a group of junior professional programmers at a major software/hardware corporation. Now this course is demanded by several other units all over the world in this company. The book is a perfect introduction to C++ as well as the fundamental skills of programming, which all too many books neglect. The chapters on Errors and Testing provide key skills that all too many books ignore, because systematically dealing with errors is deemed either not an appropriate subject matter (it most certainly is), or outside the context of a book on introductory C++ (it is not). I have no reservation that this is ideal for your use as a self teaching instrument, as a course, or as a preparation for programming in the real world using today's C++.  We understood what the book offered at the outset because we read its clearly stated objectives, accepted its premises, and followed through on the practice hints. No book can satisfy every possible need. Fortunately, most reviewers seem to be aware of the initial   assumptions of this book and review it within the boundaries set. It would be unfair to judge a book on promises it did not make.  Having read almost every C++ book out there due to our job as professional programmers, and students of C++, this book raises head   and shoulder above many books in this class (which is the beginning professional programmers set). Its success is demonstrated by the   course which was taught to people who knew some amount of programming but come from diverse backgrounds. Everyone seem to come away with a clear understanding of C++, and praised the order of presentation and its focus on what is relevant.  The chapters on STL gathered the most wonder from people in my course. The fact that the behavior is different between size and   elements, (at vs []) won't become apparent until you look again at the implementation of vector. Invalidating iterators on insertion also seem surprising until you understand the possible implementations of different containers. This, IMHO is shown very clearly by this book and murkily at best in most other book of this group.  The book is never intended to teach you every rules of C++. Such book exists, and it is not this book. It is meant to teach you how to approach C++ *and* Programming in general. The advice comes from the experience of someone (yes he is the inventor, but that is not really relevant here) who has practiced this skill every day for the last 40+ years, teaches this skill for many semesters to undergrads, and also argue and defend, and sometimes tease apart its merits with the professional community. In the bastardized words of one famous college professor:\\"you teach yourself the laws of C++, but this book trains your mind to think in programming using C++.\\"  In summary, go buy this book and never look back.

And although the protag interviews people all over the world they all have the same tongue in cheek delivery.

B004EPYZTE|3.0|POST-PRODUCTION 3D (converted from 2D to 3D)<br /><br />My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.<br /><br />There are about 12 out of screen effects that extend about 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer. During the opening dialog and title there are 7+ CG effects near 25%. Also, the ending credits have glowing embers floating to a maximum of 25%.<br /><br />The cardboard cutout syndrome is fairly obvious in this title. Many scenes appear to have only 1 to 3 depths with the background or sides starkly flat. Usually when the syndrome wasn't apparent, the 3D lacked depth and crispness. I don't believe this movie was ever intended to be converted into 3D but if it was, they should not admit it.<br /><br />On a positive note, there were zero of the single instance 3D flaws normally seen in a conversion (that I noticed). The sandmen scenes were great even though the 3D was about the same as in the rest of the movie. Even with its flaws, the 3D adds to the viewing experience of this film.<br /><br />MY 3D RATING = GOOD  (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)<br /><br />Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing.

B004EPZ03O|5.0|It takes a special movie to make me get fired up, to make me cry, to make me laugh, and to make me feel genuinely happy. It takes an even more special movie to be absolutely perfect, from top to bottom, in terms of acting, direction, effects, sounds, and music. A movie like this doesn't come along all that often, and when it does, I shout it's praise from the rooftops. And I cannot think of a more perfect movie to shout praise towards than Walt Disney Picture's The Muppets, which is undoubtedly the best film I've seen all year.<br /><br />This loving revitalization of Jim Henson's legendary creations kicks off with Gary (Jason Segal, who puts on his best good-boy act here) and his younger brother Walter (a Muppet), who have both been lifelong fans of The Muppet Show. Along with Gary's girlfriend of ten years, Mary (a charming Amy Adams), they travel to California to see just where the Muppets have been since the cancellation of the show. The answer isn't pretty. Kermit is a reclusive shut-in, living in a house built for him and Miss Piggy, who has now given up her beloved frog for a fashion magazine in France. Fozzy is cracking bad jokes at a sadsack casino with a Muppets cover group, Animal has attended anger therapy classes, and Gonzo runs a plumbing business. But the whole gang has to be brought back together for one last show in order to save the Muppet Theater, which is about to be torn down and tapped for oil by tycoon Tex Richman (Chris Cooper at his menacing best.)<br /><br />The Muppets would have been an easy movie to turn into a tongue-and-cheek parody of the source material, like 2009's Land of the Lost. James Bobin, of Da Ali G Show and Flight of the Conchords fame, could have easily pulled off putting sexual themes in different shots. Jason Segal and Nicholas Stoller, who have teamed up for R-rated comedies like Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Get Him to the Greek, could have put in subtle pot jokes to elicit laughs from people old enough to get them.<br /><br />However, they didn't. What they did do was make a pure, light-hearted movie that captures everything you've ever loved about Jim Henson's creations, and amplifies it to the umpteenth degree. They've taken the characters we've grown up with and made them more modern, with added layers of pathos that make you genuinely feel for them. Kermit and Piggy's on-again, off-again relationship no longer feels like a running gag, but comes across a genuinely real affair. Hell, even Animal's love of drumming comes across as a primordial desire that he's destined to fulfill. I never thought I'd be saying this, but the Muppets feel like real people.<br /><br />That's especially true for newcomer Walter, who idolizes the Muppets for the way they make him feel empowered and normal. The story between him and Gary is perhaps the crowning achievement of the movie, as he learns to stake out his independence and uncover talents he never knew he had. Jason Segal reacts remarkably well for somebody acting side-by-side with a puppet, conveying a true sense of brotherhood with Walter. That sibling bond is one of the movie's driving strengths.<br /><br />Another strength is just how damned innocent the whole affair is. As I mentioned, this isn't a \\"modern reboot\\" of the Muppets. It's a Muppet movie made with modern technology and actors, still holding onto the same sensibilities that were on display back in 1979's The Muppet Movie. You've got your music numbers, which are very infectious and will surely be lodged in your skull for weeks. You've got your good-natured humor, which is easily grasped by children and still uproariously funny to adults. But most importantly, you've got your strong moral when all's said and done.<br /><br />Most movie morals are pretty simple, but special attention should be drawn The Muppets' excellent message to kids and adults at the end. That message, without spoiling too much, is that there is honor in losing. As long as you're willing to pick everything back up again and stick by your family and friends, you have a fighting chance, no matter how hard you're kicked down. And even if you don't win, you've at least got people who'll stay by you until the very end. That type of moral has been seen in movies like Remember the Titans and Friday Night Lights, but rarely in a film with puppets geared towards kids.<br /><br />And it's a moral that applies to The Muppets as well. Opening the same weekend as the utterly dreadful, but sadly bankable Breaking Dawn Part One, Jason Segal's love letter to his childhood may not come in first this winter. But it's put up a better fight than any film I've seen in a while, and shown such effort at crafting a purely entertaining and heartwarming experience that I can't find fault in it. Out of everything I've watched in theaters this year, this has been the only movie to make me walk out feeling completely fulfilled. It is utter perfection, one of the best films I've seen to date.<br /><br />And with that being said, then it should be entirely clear that The Muppets is the best movie I've seen this year. Run, don't walk, to your local theater and shell out the money for this charming, heartwarming, and hilarious landmark.<br /><br />Grade: A+<br /><br />(note: This review originally appeared on my Tumblr blog, Dem Reviews)have a fighting chance, no matter how hard you're kicked down. And even if you don't win, you've at least got people who'll stay by you until the very end. That type of moral has been seen in movies like Remember the Titans and Friday Night Lights, but rarely in a film with puppets geared towards kids.   And it's a moral that applies to The Muppets as well. Opening the same weekend as the utterly dreadful, but sadly bankable Breaking Dawn Part One, Jason Segal's love letter to his childhood may not come in first this winter. But it's put up a better fight than any film I've seen in a while, and shown such effort at crafting a purely entertaining and heartwarming experience that I can't find fault in it. Out of everything I've watched in theaters this year, this has been the only movie to make me walk out feeling completely fulfilled. It is utter perfection, one of the best films I've seen to date.  And with that being said, then it should be entirely clear that The Muppets is the best movie I've seen this year. Run, don't walk, to your local theater and shell out the money for this charming, heartwarming, and hilarious landmark.   Grade: A+  (note: This review originally appeared on my Tumblr blog, Dem Reviews)
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|This was a fabutastical flick! Loved RG in this role and still giggle to myself about some...most of the \\"quirky\\" lines!!    have to believe that most people can relate to the ttle alone. The only word missing is FUNNY!
B005KMX866|4.0|I am a big Chris Isaak fan.  I have enjoyed everything he has put out.  My main complaint with Beyond The Sun is that I wish Isaak had made these songs more his own.  What they are are faithful renderings of the originals.  The vocals are tight, the music and production is crisp and spot on.  It just lacks Isaak's own interpretation of these songs.  All in all, a good effort but not a great one (which is what I usually give him).
B003INBOE2|5.0|I know this film isn't exactly historically accurate, it is after all a big budget picture, but that is no matter as it was amazing. If your looking for a well paced, action film with dramatic hues, life like characters, beautiful set pieces, and a new hero, Ip MAN is the movie to purchase.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|This was a xmas gift. Ordered Nov 28 and it arrived Dec 2. Product in excellent shape and as described.
B004EPZ06Q|1.0|A rehash of the first film, almost to the T. Seriously, you guys were drugged and had another incomprehensibly crazy adventure. It sucks that this film had zero originality.
6305428352|5.0|Love this movie.  It's the kind of movie I like to watch over and over again.  Wonderful story, no cursing, good movie for any age.  Teachers should watch this movie.  I cry at the end every time I see it.
B005XOPEOU|4.0|Mylo Xyloto is the follow up to Coldplay's 2008 much heard release Viva La Vida and its unforgettable title track.  Although there is no \\"Viva La Vida\\" on Mylox Xyloto, the record contains the upbeat single \\"Every Teardrop is a Waterfall\\" and the thought provoking \\"Paradise.\\"  Both songs are distinct and favorable to listen to, especially with the rest of the songs on the album that shimmer and shine.<br /><br />Indeed, there is a tinge of the musical influence from the Viva album that shows on Mylo Xyloto. When one recalls the songs \\"Lovers of Japan\\" and \\"Strawberry Swing\\" or \\"Life in Technicolor II,\\" it appears that the band enjoyed the playful rhythmic progression of each of the songs and took its queue to continue within that up-tempo pattern on this album with songs such as \\"Charlie Brown\\" and \\"Teardrop.\\"  And what would a Coldplay album be without acoustic renderings like \\"U.F.O.\\" or the track \\"Us Against the World\\"?<br /><br />Coldplay never ceases to amaze listeners with their diverse sound be it through live performances or studio releases.  Their musical influences are heard on this record as well as within their previous releases, and there is no denying that they have been able to infuse their musical heroes from U2 to The Beatles and everything else that they include in the mix that eventually becomes the Coldplay \\"sound.\\"  And Mylo Xyloto is no exception with legendary producer Brian Eno at the production controls.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|I don't know what all the fuss is about with the bad reviews.  This looks and feels like a quality product to me and it functions as it should.  I like the way it looks.  The strap to hold the cover in place works great.  It's lightweight.  It makes the device easier to hold because of the soft backside of the cover.  The stand works just fine.  I would absolutely buy this product again.

Time flies by REALLY quickly while playing which is why I consider this game to be one of the best ever created for a mobile platform (not exaggerating).  I sure hope there is a sequel in the pipeline. Get this game now!

B001H5X7I4|5.0|Ok this movie is hilarious if you have a thick enough skin.  If you are super politically correct you WILL be offended.  There is cursing in this movie (quite a bit I would say).  But this movie is still hilarious it starts funny and it ends funny you SHOULD love it. Not reall much more I can say without spoiling so I will not.
B000001GAM|4.0|First heard on a music programme on radio, sent for it immediately, very exciting and lively, massive swings of mood. Excellent recording.
0439023491|2.0|The only reason I kept reading it was because I wanted to know what happened at the end and because they end up in the arena again. I mean the first half of the novel was so boringly long with Katniss unsure about who she loves: Gale or Peeta? Girl, just decide and go with it! Survival is what she is good at and the novel only gets exciting when she is in her element. I really think the writer should have wrapped up the Hunger Games and stopped at one novel only. I am not even excited to read the third, only want to have a closure on the story.

B000JMKNJ2|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.   If you're a fan of con men, swindlers, and heists, as well as spells and swordplay, you'll probably like this novel.  I was surprised and happy with the amount of world-building that went on, until I discovered that this is to be the first of seven novels for the author.  Scott Lynch never lets the action bog down in one place by alternating a chapter of story in the present with an interlude from the fictional past, where he weaves in clues that pay off later.  I really don't have anything in particular that I disliked about the book, though the length may turn some people off.
B004WR125O|1.0|I got in touch with tech support twice. First time an Indian woman, \\"rude & unpleasant.\\" Second time a well mannered American guy whom genuinely was trying to help me with my problem, he said he will call me back once he has researched the error code that was on display on my Onkyo 609 receiver due to the wireless LAN Adapter, he never called back!
0441013597|5.0|It's not possible to provide a real review of Dune. To review the story covers only half the novel: the other half is a philosophical meditation on everything that it means to be human. Every sentence in the book is important: Frank Herbert's beautiful, spare-yet-lyrical writing style leaves no room for a single wasted word or superfluous idea. Dune changed Science Fiction forever: it effectively ended John W. Campbell's \\"Golden Age\\" by elevating the genre to a level far higher than anyone had previously imagined possible. It will change the reader similarly.

B005LLXB9K|5.0|I started out not liking them when I was a teenager not because of age, but it seemed over little time.. there would be a Pearl Jam song pop up on the radio every time I took a 10 minute drive somewhere and usually always the same few songs.  Well around here in these boondocks it hasn't changed too much at all and neither have the songs.  I did, however, fall in love with the Yield album and found their self titled a welcome change.  Other than that I blocked a lot of the other material out for the longest time.  This doc really helped me understand the pressures of the popular music scene and I could relate to this band a great deal.  Very entertaining and well edited.  I find myself listening to them a lot more often.
B0061JPYX2|3.0|Considering the impact of 2006's instant classic Back to Black I don't think many would have thought they'd still be waiting for a follow up in 2011. In the years between the two albums Amy became a drug user and by 2008 at age 24 was diagnosed with emphysema as a result of smoking crack cocaine, cannabis & tobacco. Images of Amy on drugs from 2008 onwards were grim. Weight drained with sunken cheeks she looked like a completely different person to the happy curvaceous Frank singer of 2003. Amid stories of bar fights and substance abuse eventually reports of new music trickled through. In October 2009 Island Records co-president Darcus Beese claimed- `I've heard a couple of song demos that have absolutely floored me', while Amy stated in July 2010 that a new album similar in sound to BtB would be released by 2011. Throughout 2010 Universal had kept several London studios open around the clock incase Amy would want to record. However following her death most reports indicated studio sessions had been sporadic and the bulk of new material left behind consisted of demos. Amy's passing was not a surprise but it was a shock and ultimately disappointing as we'd never get a third album from this prodigal songstress as intended.<br /><br />For the release of Lioness: Hidden Treasures Salem Remi, Mark Ronson & co have compiled a career spanning collection of material consisting of Frank/BtB demos, multiple covers and a couple of new tracks. In short this is not the mock up third album of all new material fans were hoping for, although it appears only two new songs were completed so perhaps this is as close as we're going to get. Being a shameless cash grab aimed at the Christmas market it is as you would expect a mixed offering, but more than anything this collection highlights the diversity of Amy's music both vocally and stylistically. 'Between the Cheats' (2008) a Doo-wop inspired number and one of the tracks most likely to have appeared on a third album is an undisputed highlight. It shuffles along in somber/soulful fashion and features an awesome chorus. You get the sense the vocals could have been a guide track as some of the lines seem slightly muffled. That aside BTC ranks alongside anything off BtB. 'Tears Dry' (2005) on paper looks like an needless addition but with a slowed tempo and original arrangement in lieu of the Gaye/Terrell sample it's effectively a completely different song and arguably better than the 'original' version.<br /><br />Other highlights include new song 'Like Smoke' (2008) which finds Amy swapping verses with her favourite rapper Nas, Frank era leftover 'Best Friends, Right?' & 1930's Jazz standard 'Body and Soul' recorded in March of this year with another of her musical heros- Tony Bennet (originally appearing on his Duets II album). On the flip side demos of BtB tracks we've all heard a million times such as 'Wake Up Alone' & 'Valerie' are unessesary and feel like they're included to make up the numbers while Mark Ronson's posthumously added production to tracks such as 'Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow' feels forced and ham-fisted. The final song is a cover of the Leon Russell classic 'A Song For You' made famous by Donny Hathaway. Recorded by Salem Remi in 2009 at Amy's home while she was reportedly under the influence of heroin. This is not Amy at her best but the performances' failings actually add an extra layer of emotion that elevate this to become one of her most powerful songs, and it's inclusion while somewhat controversial paints the full picture of who she was within the scope of her music by showing her at her best And worst. To conclude If you're a fan this is an essential purchase full of rarities and gems which occasionally rival Frank & BtB.highlight.

0061969656|5.0|Bernard Cornwell continues to drawn me in with the sixth of his Saxon Tales.  Alfred lies dying, and Wessex is threatened by Danes from the north and traitorous Centish and Mercian Saxons alike.  Can Edward hold on to his father's throne?<br /><br />This book is great for the same reasons that made its predecessors great.  By focusing on people -- relationships, institutions and culture -- Cornwell creates a fascinating ninth century English milieu.  The stories are action-packed.  The plots are complicated and contain well-crafted twists.  Uhtred of Bebbanburg, irreverent pagan and pragmatic warrior, makes a great, complex and likeable protagonist and foil to Alfred, whose kingdom and work are at stake.  I can't wait for the next one.
B000002N1E|5.0|The early 90's were a rough time for Prince after \\"Diamonds and Pearls\\" when he decided to experiment heavily with hip-hop, go even funkier, and fuse genres that seemed impossible to bridge together. \\"Come\\" and this album were actually recorded at the same time but you would never know it listening to these songs.<br /><br />Prince wanted to release this album under his new symbol and prove that his newer direction was superior to the songs found on \\"Come\\" but his record label didn't green-light 2 Prince releases in one year so we'll never know what the response would've been. I think Prince did though when he decided to call this \\"The Gold Experience\\".<br /><br />This in my opinion is the best album he put out in the 90's; it's cohesive, it's energetic, and feels like Prince is back in action again (although the little interludes were unnecessary). You can't compare this to Purple Rain, Sign O' The Times, or any of his other classic albums because this has elements of all his past albums and the hip-hop/R&B/funkier sound is actually PERFECTED here whereas it sounds out of place or flat out ridiculous on some of his other albums. The songs \\"Gold\\", \\"Most Beautiful Girl In the World\\", and \\"Endorphinmachine\\" are some of his best songs period.<br /><br />If you can find this album, buy it without hesitation because it's out of print and shouldn't be. Either Prince or Warner Bros. needs to get these songs reissued in a way that will satisfy both parties because this is a modern day classic.
B0063IH60K|5.0|responsive and infuriating,definitely a good mind teaser. I had just as much fun as playing the old version on my desktop.
B000002N9L|4.0|This album was basically Prince giving his label scraps to release so he could get out of his contract. Yet, this \\"compilation\\" actually flows like an album (a shorter one, about 40 minutes). It's more abrasive and rock-oriented than any of Prince's other albums, which isn't a bad thing because his guitar skills shine very brightly.<br /><br />This collection of songs is lighter than the album \\"Come\\" and darker than \\"The Gold Experience\\". I think if you took the best songs from \\"Come\\" and the best songs from \\"Chaos and Disorder\\", you could probably construct a cohesive masterpiece out of it.<br /><br />\\"Chaos and Disorder\\" has the cynical world view that \\"Come\\" had but glimpses of brightness that \\"The Gold Experience\\" had. \\"Gold Experience\\" flowed whereas the other albums feel disjointed but this album has a lot of really good songs that stood on their own (my favorites off of this one, \\"Into the Light\\" and the title track).<br /><br />If you can find this, don't pass it up and I really suggest you take your favorites from \\"Come\\" and \\"Chaos and Disorder\\" and knock yourself out to create what could've been a hit/classic for Prince had he not had his record company problems.
1931559317|5.0|The S&T Pocket Sky Atlas is aimed at amateur astronomers who want a handy guide to the night sky. If you're brand-new to astronomy then you will want to supplement this book with a field guide of some sort. Turn Left at Orion would be a great starter.   As far as this Atlas is concerned, there are a lot of things I like about it. The spiral binding and paper quality allow it to hold up well in the field. It's a small book, so easy to carry around and hold at the eyepiece but it's not too small. The scale of the charts is generous. The stars go down to magnitude 7, which is ideal for naked-eye star-hopping even from a very dark site. The index at the back lists separately the Messier and Caldwell objects, which is really useful as I'm often looking these up. I also like that it plots all of the H400 objects, which a lot of amateurs go after. (Even the very large and expensive Sky Atlas 2000.0 does not seem to contain all the H400 objects. A curious oversight.) The S&T atlas also lists 55 carbon stars. There are Telrad circles printed on the inside of the front cover to help you on your way. I can't recommend this highly enough.
B001HN6922|2.0|We have come to expect perfection from Pixar.  Most of their movies, especially those released in the last few years, have had such amazing character development on multiple layers that I have been left in awe at Pixar's ability to craft a story.  Of course, the animation has gotten better as technology has improved, so that each movie is a work of art.    Cars 2 is certainly a visual work of art.  Pixar has almost never failed to deliver on that point (with the exception being A Bug's Life, but that's another review for another day).  As I watched bits and pieces of Cars 2 with my son this morning, I was amazed at how impeccably the lighting reflects off the cars' front bumpers.  It's like being in a new car showroom!  HOWEVER, the story in this movie is so incredibly flat that it is almost painful to endure.  In the original Cars, I couldn't get enough of Radiator Springs.  It's a place that reminds us that there is still some good in this world.  Cars 2 issues a stark reminder that there is still much evil in the world.  I found myself wanting to find Radiator Springs and live there.  In Cars 2, I want to hide from the world.  There is no sense of nostalgia and heart and soul like there is in the original Cars.    I have also been impressed with Pixar's ability to keep politics out of their movies (with the exception of WALL-E, but again, another review...).  Most of their movies have been based on solid family values, no matter which religious or political spectrum a person finds him/herself.  Cars 2 fails on that point too.  The demonizing of oil companies and uplifting of alternative fuels certainly enters a political forum.  This kind of political viewpoint does not belong in a children's movie.  Let's leave that kind of teaching to the parents, please.
0385341008|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  I enjoyed all of it and when I got near the end I didn't want to finish and leave all the wonderful characters I met inside.  I would suggest this to anyone but especially anyone who remembers life in WWII.

So this case gives me the protection I need for peace of mind but I can still see the cuteness of the phone :)  Yay!  Also, I saw a previous reviewer had complaints about the photo quality once this case was attached to their phone.  I have taken photos with and without the flash and all have been perfectly clear.

B0012BV9FG|5.0|I bought this dinosaur along with some other Schleich dinosaurs (allosaurus, stegosaurus, pterodactyl, etc.. excuse my spelling) and all i can say is WOW! each one i got in the mail were high quality perfection! its very durable and stable. not like those \\"made in china\\" dollar store dinosaurs. well worth the money for the quality. My son is very into dinosaurs and with all the lifelike models he'll have the best christmas ever!. its so detailed and even comes with a human scale model to show the ratio of the actual size. it stands tall and heavy 2-3 lbs it aint going no where for a long time. it would make a great collectors showpiece or a longlasting friend for any child. i have some papo dinosaurs which are in close competition but for right now nothing compares to Schleich!! awesome awesome.
B00005BL2A|5.0|As your boney fingers close around me,  long and spindly, death becomes me,   heaven can you see what i see?  Paying a debt to karma, you party for a living,  what you take won't kill you, be careful what you're giving  There's no time for hesitating,   pain is ready, pain is waiting,  primed to do its educating...  And so the album begins. I've read numerous reviews, mainly out of boredom. But it seems that while Martin's voice and choices as a musician seem to grow, DM \\"classic\\" fans have become the more cynical b*tchy bunch.   As Martin waxes poetic with the opening lines relating to wasted time and life, \\"come uppance\\" and dare i say it KARMIC payback for someone living a wasteful life, it bothers me that people don't see the artistry in this album. [I don't know who he's berating in the opener, but I've found many that fit the song in my life]  As another reviewer has noted, when this album dropped, it DEFINITELY was a GROWER (grows on you) Although some of the musical arrangements are typical DM (acoustic guitar riff ala Personal Jesus) MANY of the sounds are not.   Gone is the 90's flair of a FLOOD arrangement, and in steps MARK BELL to rearrange the band's style. Strings, synths, low pulse beats and sparse arrangements make this an ultimate chill album: notable exceptions being \\"The Dead of Night\\" which sounds like a grinder of some sorts, and the single I FEEL LOVED, which sounds like it was lifted from The Smashing Pumpkins album ADORE.  I don't understand how this album rates so poorly with DM fans, unless it's because the album is a departure from the typical arrangements. Apparently Martin had writer's block during this time, and it doesn't show much except on songs like COMATOSE (is it about drugs or merely sleep?) and Breathe which reiterates the strength and weakness of rumors.   BUT(!) highlighted here are some truly exceptional songs:  Dream On (brilliant flury of poetry and anger)  When the body speaks (one of their best ballads set to a low heartbeat like pulse)  The Dead of Night (where Martin chews at the moronic night crews that merely live to be self pitying rich club zombies)  Freelove (a semi romantic song about a \\"no strings attached\\" relationshiP)  I Am You (one of their best haunting somber romantic songs: whether good or bad, a oneness in a relationship, referred to in both beauty as well as fear \\"we're in this trap\\", and likening love to an addiction)   Goodnight Lovers which closes the album as a tribute to the classic blues style, think of the R&B classic \\"you're good for me\\" (solomon burke)   OF course though, i have the ability to distinguish between lyrical content, music AND both. So much of this album was lost to casual fans wanting a club song, and to the ordinary fans who merely live to continue whining about how DM won't release another VIOLATOR, and get older  and fatter  and perhaps balder.  Live a little and come back to this album. Its strength is its restraint. It's not quite the downer that Playing the Angel is (possibly a love note to Martin's divorce)   I merely put this review up to reaffirm that it IS a great album, albeit a different one created at a different time.   I always used to like Martin's work to that of Pete Townshend, shocking, brilliant and revelatory. BUT, I've since come to expect that Martin will surpass him. Some people gravitate towards a \\"pain that they're used to\\". However this album doesn't fit the usual cynic misnomer of \\"DEPRESS MODE\\" there's quite a bit of positivity here.

B005VPSEK2|5.0|I'm old enough to no longer be enchanted by pop music as a genre.  But this girl's voice is so strong, and she sings with such passion and consummate professionalism, that you get the feeling that she transcends any genre she sings.  The album really becomes a vehicle to just enjoy her raw talent, and the songs - while all very strong - are just vehicles to expose that voice.    Kelly appears to be a true musical chameleon.  She can pull off pop, soulful melodies, and country music, and it comes across like she isn't even trying very hard when switching between entirely different genres.  It's just natural for her to make enormous vocal changes, and it all seems to be fully within her professional range.    You get the feeling that there is literally no limit to what she can do vocally or professionally.  Is she going to start singing Opera and Blues on the next album?  If she doesn't it won't be because she cannot pull off the notes or tempo.  This girl is just that remarkable.
B0014PAFQ4|5.0|Phoenix (released April 2008) is the first album to feature all the original members of Asia since the band's second album Alpha back in the Summer of '83. The album starts off rocking with Never Again, songs like Heroine show that the band can still turn out ballads and cool upbeat pop songs like Alibis, An Extraordinary Life and Shadow Of A Doubt. The band's playing on songs like Parallel Worlds/Vortex/Deya is fantastic. While the album isn't perfect, I actually find the songs that I like surpass some of their early '80's work. This version of the album includes interviews with the band members that can be viewed on a computer. The artwork is quite nice but I've noticed that the black backgound is already beginning to rub off even though it hasn't been removed from it's case that much.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|After getting the Fire, which I like mainly for its form factor, I wanted to load it up with a bunch of my media and immediately bumped up against the five and a half GB available for this. Without the ability to throw a 32GB SDHC in it, this really isn't enough for any reasonable media collection. I had conceded that I would have to find another way to access my media or live without it. After looking at what VLC could do and trying to set up access via TVersity, I had come up with nothing.<br /><br />Enter Plex. Basically, in 10 minutes I had made 2$ purchase from Amazon on the Fire and downloaded/installed the Plex media server on my Dell laptop. Now I am watching a streaming video on my Fire over WiFi as I write this. Considering what you can do with an iPad/Apple TV/iTunes, I am really pleased those of us not plugged into the iEcosystem have an option like this.<br /><br />The interface for the media server and the client app are very well done. Specifically, the media server UI works well in Chrome which is a big plus. It gives my hope that the devs have their head on straight.<br /><br />Considering the server is free, this app is worth every penny.
B001AW156U|5.0|The triggers feel amazing. They are very similar to the feel of the gamecube controller triggers( my favorite controller of all time) and are different from the xbox 360 controller because they are more curvy and larger. I honestly believe they are better than the xbox 360 triggers since they are usually compared to the ps3 dual triggers and they are very comfortable and feel very nice. Not just a must have for fps and racing fans but for any gamer with a ps3. The controller should have been designed like that in the first place.
1878424505|5.0|I've read this book eight times.  I love it and it changed my life. THe service was prompt and the book came in excellent shape.
B005V1WZ10|4.0|I'm digging it! It's nice to see a band experiment from time to time. I liked their experimentation on See You On The Other Side and this one sounds great as well!
0439023483|5.0|As a woman in my 30's I was somewhat reluctant to start this series, but it was strongly recommended to me so I gave it a try, and I'm SO glad I did! The story grabs you immediately and continues to keep your attention through the very last page, making me grateful that I had ordered all three books so I could keep reading. The details of the storyline are very well thought out and have you thinking beyond just the words you are reading. It quickly became one of my favorites and I can't wait to see how it all plays out!
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|Works on the XOOM and is great for kids. keeping it. Gives you the option to use different materials (brush, crayon, markers) and colours
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I can't draw a straight line but in minutes using stickers, highlights and backgrounds I created a picture worthy of saving to my album. Easy and fun to use for all ages (I'm 72). Highly recommended.

B005FVFWOI|5.0|I will dispense with superlatives since none of them do this CD justice. Rather, imagine sitting down to listen to the Aqualung you grew up with; muddy, indistinct, not quite good enough. Now imagine JT in your room playing this live, just for you. Now imagine several alternative versions, also performed live just for you. The sound quality is literally that good. Instruments are distinct, rhythms are punchy, vocal are crystal clear. I wish all my music sounded like this.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This thing has picked up every station I've thrown at it: local radio, web stations, you name it.  Very pleased.

B001FOR5XU|5.0|I had seen the movie (with Will Smith), and I loved it. So as soon as I found out that it was based on a book, I had to get it! Though the book and movie are quite different, I absolutely loved it! My only complaint is that it was to short :( It also has a bunch of neat, unrelated, short stories at the end!
B004EPZ06Q|1.0|I had the same problem with the Green Lantern Blue Ray-The UV digital copy is a piece of crap!!!!! It will not play on the ipod like promised. I wrote them a very long email asking them to refund my money and that I would never buy any dvd's from them again if they chose to keep providing us with this falsely advertised digital copy! I was lucky and they sent me a code to download the movie from iTunes. So maybe try that, and once they get enough of those emails, they will realize their mistake in switching over to this UV/Flixter crap!!!! Let our voices be heard!!

B005K01VZS|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  You will love the characters right from the start.  It will make you think about where you are on your faith journey. It is a book everyone should read, especially moving for the holiday season. I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie. Now I can't wait for the movie to come out!

B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I really love all the choices and colors this has.  It just looks great on screen.  One thing that would be really nice, though, is a smudges/blending tool.  Would love to do that with the paints and Crayon.  Thank you for such an enjoyable app. :)
0375831002|4.0|At first I found the bits-and-pieces style annoying, and death's little asides gimmicky, but I eventually stopped being annoyed, and began to enjoy the odd style.  It didn't became a page turner for me until the last hundred pages or so, which I read straight, huddled in bed, crying until my throat hurt.<br /><br />The language is often poetically pretentious.  I kept stopping to reread a phrase, and thinking \\"those two words make no sense together,\\" or \\"my critique group would say you can't use this verb with this noun.\\"  Then I'd think, \\"I must be stupid.\\"  Then I'd think, \\"No, the author's just trying to make me feel stupid.\\"  Then I'd think, \\"Oh well, I guess it's poetry.\\"  The problem is, all that time, I was thinking about the words, not feeling involved in the characters' lives.  Perhaps that's what led to the slowness of the pace.<br /><br />However, some passages I thought stunningly beautiful, some descriptions masterful.<br /><br />I think the plot would have fared better with fewer dire predictions, because I felt almost let down by a few of them.<br /><br />I love the character of Papa, but Zuzak's gorgeous depiction of Liesel's friendship with the Jew in the basement is the highlight for me.<br /><br />I enjoyed this story, and its dark wisdom and deep humanity.  A good, but saddening, read.
B006470HZ6|5.0|This season is every bit as wonderfully tense as the first. It's way more focused on the characters than the walkers, but that's a plus in my book. The story line that is so much more dense and smart than zombie movies are ever allowed to be. The characters have depth. All around great show.
B0063IH60K|5.0|nice app, plain old solitaire but lots of options. I'm addicted already. love it on my kindle fire, but it might be small on a phone. like the undo feature. I have never had a force close and I use it a ton.
B0030DBGXY|5.0|I have put over 100 \\"trail\\" miles on this knife in less than two years. Lots of wood splitting and carving poles, stakes, cordage cutting etc. The San Mai III steel is well worth the extra money. It's a laminated steel with the harder stuff in the middle. It has enough belly for field dressing your kill, splitting wood for a fire, or slicing your way through stinging nettles. It's slightly blade heavy with great balance just forward of the handle. It has a nice thick spine to handle *heavy* use. The fact Cold Steel chose not to add a notch in the spine is a plus in my book. I have seen more than one \\"big\\" knife break off from the notch forward while using a baton on them.. and I'm talking 175+ dollar knives. I've heard of other people having issues with Cold Steel's partial tang where it separates from the Kraton handle or even breaks, but I stopped worrying about mine a while back. This SRK San Mai batons 3-4\\" logs beautifully and still keeps that edge (and it's tip!).<br /><br />I do wish the handle was Micarta and the sheath was a heavier \\"ballistic\\" type nylon instead of the Securex material. If you just want this knife for your collection go ahead but this knife won't be happy unless she's working. It does have a long sexy clip point that most people would hate to see bashing through poplar logs...but... If you are considering this knife for an actual working \\"bush\\" knife you will be happy with it's performance. It consistently outperforms almost every other \\"big\\" knife I have except for my TOPS Condor Alert (Great knife also!)...and that's only because it has a 8.5 inch cutting edge and a sweet finger choil. They are about equal so far in my opinion although I've used the SRK much more frequently. I love the edge retention of the San Mai III steel. I almost never put a hone to this knife. I hit it every so often with a couple strokes of the Smith's pocket pal and she stays razor sharp.<br /><br />Whenever I'm in the woods I normally carry my Sven saw, a machete or a \\"big\\" knife, and a small neck knife. I find this 3 tool combo offers me almost unlimited versatility.<br />Whenever I choose to go off with only a single knife, my Cold Steel SRK San Mai is the only choice (at least until this knife fails me).<br /><br />Thanks for reading.<br /><br />**UPDATE 11-4-2014**<br />I'm back to buy one for a friend so I thought I would provide a little update. Wow what a great steel this San Mai has turned out to be. Knife edge is holding up beautifully. No chips despite encountering the occasional wood knot. I now only use this knife when backpacking, because of its size whereas before I carried it hunting and occasionally when working. I got a cheap Camillus Carnivore for work and carry my Tops Condor when hunting. I spend an average of thirty nights a year camping when backpacking the last couple years and my SRK has been with me for every one of them. Thanks again for reading and don't hesitate to ask me any questions. I will try to answer as best as I can.<br /><br />SPOe or a \\"big\\" knife, and a small neck knife.

B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I'm not the biggest reviewer of apps, I know, I apologize. However, this app is worth reviewing. I've used drawing apps before, but found them all annoying, either because of invasive permissions, or clunky menus. Drawing Pad had none of that, the only permission it needs is to modify SD card contents. the tools are easy to use, intuitive, and perfect for a simple drawing app. Bravo to the dev!
B000A896L6|1.0|The listed dvd was incompatible with both our dvd player and our computer player, thus we were unable to view it.  The return postage is almost as much as was paid for the dvd, and so we are stuck with it.  We had heard good things about the feature itself, but we'll just have to find out another way.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I bought this headset for my husband because he had to have Turtle Beach and these were the only wireless ones. He loves them. I tried them on, and the sound is just amazing. Crystal clear and detailed, you even hear different sounds in each ear. It was easy to install, and he was gamaing in minutes. I would recommend if you get these to buy rechargable batteries, because they do go through batteries quickly.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|It's the supporting cast that makes this work. I just wish they did'nt have to kill off one of best if smallest roles in the show. Remains to be seen if the non-vampire narratives will play out as well as the bloodsuckers.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this DVD because a friend recommended it!  It has been a fabulous workout.  My husband who had been searching for months for a good work out that would work with his schedule started using it and loves it even more than me.  Definitely see a difference!
0670022705|4.0|This book should have been a beautiful coffee table took. True, it is a good value, I suppose, for the money, but I do love books for their esthetics as well as their contents. They missed the mark here for what could have been a truly gorgeous volume.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|started reading it and it started lie to me day one! it talking about zombies and people come back to life.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|It has taken me awhile to come up with a review of this outstanding series because there are so many positive assets about this truely funny series.  Now that the series ended a few years ago, I can look back and see how it iverall was one of the best series in television history.  First, I must commend the excellent writing that each show had.  Funny, sometimes sad, but always entertaining and interesting.  The actors, David Schwimmer, Matt Le Blanc, Matthew Perry, Jennifer Anistron, Lisa Kudrow, Courtney Cox make up this great crew.  I can't give details  becuase it would take to long for this review.  However, from an overall perspective, you can see how the cast matured over the years, how everything fell into place in the lives of the characters, and the great twists of the plot truely made this a must see every Thursday Night.  I miss this series, hopefully one day they can do a reunion and an update of the characters lives.  Overall, this is a must get for anyone that likes truely funny, intelligent, and heart warming shows.  HIGHLY Recommended!

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I have been waiting for this item since November 23, 2011. Not shipped as of yet. IT IS NOT IN STOCK.
0439023521|5.0|I tried to avoid reading this book because of the dark content. I avoid anything too serious and too depressing because day in and day out my job requires me to work with people with horrific and sad lives. Why would I want my leisurely time spent on entertainment that reminds me of my stressful job? But upon the insistence of my friends I relented. I'm glad I did. I could not put the book down. The characters are very well drawn out; the plot is fascinating.   What bothers me, however, is how much the author underestimates adults. In reality, adults in the districts would not allow 74 games to go on without a rebellion. I would guess they may let one game pass--see the horror of it--and sacrifice themselves to never let that happen again. We are very protective of our children. When we have righteous anger, we would sacrifice ourselves for the innocent. While I find these obedient Hunger Games parents and adults perplexing, I remind myself that this is a science fiction novel and that most likely these games would never happen in real life. I would bet a future like \\"Logan's Run\\" would happen before we torture children for entertainment. Western civilization seems to value the youth more than older adults.

0307595862|2.0|While there are many admirable elements in the Nesbø's Harry Hole novels, they are far outweighed by the outlandishly implausible plots turns. There are so many of them, I'll only mention them by category:<br /><br />1) Harry almost gets fired.  In every book his superiors want to fire Hole, but something always happens at the last minute to prevent his dismissal.  In this book, it happens twice. I know this is meant to create suspense, but we all know that if Harry's fired, the book is over.<br /><br />2) Red herrings and false endings. Just when it looks like Harry has caught the killer, it either turns out that he's misidentified him, or that some unbelievable coincidence allows the killer to evade capture.  This book has so many false endings that the constant series of \\"we've got him; no we haven't got him\\" moments causes one of the book's characters to have a psychotic break! These events may not drive the reader crazy, they do try his patience.  Again, this is supposed to create suspense, but if you have a 400-page book in your hands and you're only on page 240, it's pretty clear that the solution that's being offered is a red herring.<br /><br />3) Killers obsess on Harry. Crime novelist often try to build suspense by having the killer go after the hero, but it's just not plausible. In real life, killing a single detective who is on your trail would be worse than useless, because it would greatly intensify the effort to catch you. In Harry Hole's world, however, every murderer is after either him, his partner, or his friends. Other reviewers here obvious find this thrilling, but I just find it preposterous, cheesy and annoying.<br /><br />4) Failure to communicate.  Every time somebody has a really vital piece of information to share with Harry he's killed before he has a chance to spill the beans.  Again, a poor attempt at suspense.  Will he live to tell Harry the killer's identity? Of course not!  We're only on page 100.<br /><br />Harry doesn't give out much information, either. Real detectives are expected to share the details of their cases with partners and bosses, but Harry constantly works leads without telling anyone.  That allows him to go into dangerous situations with no backup, usually forgetting his gun or his phone or both. Incredibly, some readers find this exciting, instead of just phony and boring.<br /><br />Like Nesbø, I could go on and on with these criticisms, but unlike him, I'll at least make a token effort at restraint.  Clearly, in order to write a 400-page detective story you either need to put in a lot of character development and insight into the human condition, or fill the pages with phony plot twists. Nesbø relies too little on the former and too much on the latter.  Given the number of positive reviews here, it's obvious that many readers like their hamburger with lots of filler.  I, however, an too old to eat my meals at McDonald's, or to slog my way through Nesbø's dull prose.ected to share the details of their cases with partners and bosses, but Harry constantly works leads without telling anyone.

B006A7ZAYS|4.0|I love the Roots. They have such a chill vibe and natural feel to their music that you cant find anywhere else in rap right now.  Black thought is one of the most underated lyricists.  It's not their best album but it is solid.  I would rate this album slightly lower than how i got over.
B000PMLFRA|4.0|What can be said about Star Wars, that hasn't been said so many times before? Entertaining, fun, great acting, story, action all rolled up into one. People have been talking about it for years, and will continue to for many years to come. There was absolutely nothing like it, and nothing will ever compare to it again. Ok, it is not The Godfather, Gone With The Wind, Wizard Of Oz, or Citizen Kane. It doesn't pretend to be. But the impact it has made over the years, proves just how strong cinema can be. Many people have been waiting for years for this film to be released in HD, and for good reason, if any film calls out to be in HD, this is it. Finally after many years, George Lucas has agreed to finally release this film on blu-ray. I agree with most people who say that this is the most anticipated film ever to be released in the HD format. I have been collecting this film on all different formats for many years, and was thrilled to pick it up on blu-ray, when I first heard it was going to be released. Then I started hearing all the rumours about it not being the original version, etc. I will coment on that right now, because I believe that it is very important. But it will be short and to the point, then I will give my review on the quality of the blu-ray itself. First off, I have to say that I don't believe people should play around with their creations too much. Like Da Vinci, imagine he took down the Mona Lisa, and painted her hair blonde, or some other color, because by today standards, for some reason or another it wouldn't be politically correct, or taking the Last Supper painting and painting Mary Magdaleine in there, because some people now say, that she was at the last supper. Or musicians, going back to the recording studio and tinkering with their classic songs, because they believe something was left out, etc. It really isn't right to alter your work. However, Star Wars is George Lucas's baby, and he can do whatever he likes with it. But that doesn't always make it right. Censoring and altering can cause dangerous precedents later on. Yes, I do wish that he would have included both versions, the original and updated versions here, but no. I believe and hope like many others, that perhaps in the future, he will clean up the original version, and release it in HD in a offical SW release, but until that happens, this edition will have to suffice. Now on the blu-ray itself, the video and audio are absolutely unbelievable. Without a doubt these are among the finest blu-rays, that I have ever seen. I can say without reservations, that these are definitely reference quality, and if you just got a brand new blu-ray player, then these should be your first pick up for your system. I played them on my PS3, because I don't have a blu-ray player yet, and they looked outstanding. The color, sharpness, and all the details are there, definitly blows the standard dvds out of the water. The 6.1 surround audio is also incredible, you will hear ships, gunshots, and lazers, whizzing all around you. It is really like you are in the middle of all the action. So even with George Lucas's polishing and tinkering, although I don't agree with it, it still doesn't ruin the integrity of the film itself. And if i wish to watch the orignal version of Star Wars, I still have the original laser disc in mint condition, and still have a laser disc player that fortunately still works to watch it. So with the alterations and all, and even though this is only bare bones, with only commentaries, I still recommend The Star Wars Original Trilogy IV, V, VI.ays make it right.

B004QK5N5W|5.0|I purchased this along with a Mediabridge hdmi cable so that I could watch movies off my iPad on the tv.  I have had great success and the iPad actually is displayed all the time on the tv.  I know some reviewers said it only worked  during movie playback.  I can say for my iPad 2 it shows what's on your screen not just during playback of movies.  It's also nice that it has a charger port built into it so when the battery runs low you can keep watching the movie or displaying whatever you have up on the screen.
0553801473|2.0|I can appreciate the naivet&eacute; of some of the fellow readers on this book by saying it deserves 5 stars.  I think the 1st review for this book sums it up in a nut shell.  We expected the same level out of this book as we did with the first three is not all four previous books.  We didn't get that, in fact it appears that the pact was broken on this book and we seemed to digress.  It appears that Martin is overfilled with concepts of possible TV series so therefore he wrote this one like a bad soap opera.  He went out of his way to fill it with perverse scenes and horrible scripted sex scenes to get apparently get a rise out of us, or to page homage to future HBO episodes.  In the end he started destroy his environment like a petulant child throwing a tantrum.  Maybe it is just my expectations being raised so high by his previous works.  I just did not find the enjoyment, nor the zeal I had with other previous books.  I wish I knew this about the book, because I might have stopped at book four and just let me imagination fill in the nagging questions I had about the future of the storyline.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|I've been using the Nyko Zoom for Kinect with my Xbox 360 for a couple months and have excellent praise for the device. Before the Zoom, we would have to move our couch out of the way in order for the Kinect to properly identify us when playing games like Dance Central and DanceMasters. When we got the Zoom, it moved the focus area to about 2 feet in front of the couch, so no more rearranging the room to just play a Kinect game.<br /><br />Downsides are that if you're having trouble with your Kinect even before connecting the Zoom, this won't change anything. A lot of people I have spoke with bought the Zoom thinking it would magically solve their issues when it didn't. By moving the camera, performing a complete recalibration (with the Zoom on the Kinect) and making sure there is proper space to the left/right, their problems are solved.<br /><br />I've also found that the Zoom for Kinect helps with \\"party atmospheres\\" in that the players are able to stand closer to the TV, but still have room to play the games without bumping into each other and spectators are able to stand around them to enjoy the show. If you have a projector and the Kinect below it, with the Zoom you can almost perform right at the screen, makes for a pretty cool show.

B0052UZIFA|1.0|Great game, but buggier than imaginable.  Responsive customer service enters a trouble ticket w/ the dev... Well, that's peachy, &amp; thx for the quick response, but it clearly is not ready for widespread android use.  Buyer beware if you have the Samsung Epic Galaxy S2.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I have really enjoyed playing this stupidly addictive game. it runs far too well. if it glitched I would not play so stinking much and get way more stuff done.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Downloaded easy, simple to use. Nice features such as card type and play type.  Ive used it every day since getting it!!!
B0051MKMNC|5.0|Believe it or not, I could not find the Blu ray version of this movie anywhere! So why didn't I think of Amazon sooner, not only did I find it, I got it at a amazing price.  This is one of the best movies I had seen in a long time.
0321704452|4.0|Author Garr Reynolds presents a powerful guide into successful public speaking and presentation. He uses real life examples, especially from the orient, to better explain his main ideas. This provides a more realistic and visual interpretation of his arguments. He also incorporates the works of other experts to provide more insight. The lessons are well elaborated and easy to understand. Loved the book.
0060558121|3.0|For the first three quarters of this book I was reading an enjoyable, original, masterpiece.  Then came the last quarter--I thought Gaiman slid his laptop over to someone else and asked them to finish it for him.  A drastic twist in the direction of the story and an EXTREMELY disappointing ending.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|I have to say that I was really really really really surprised when i watched this. I read reviews and the reviews were divided and I just couldn't figure out why?  Well ? The typical mindless action morons thought this was another \\"Furious Fest or Transporter\\". I am soooo thankful that this was actually a real film. Now \\"THIS\\" is film making \\"THIS\\" is artistry, craft and for the intellectual. I love this film to death it has EVERYTHING.. the quirkiness, the cars the gore the music and the cinematography. I mean this movie is just gorgeous to look at and the mood it puts you in when watching it. Its so dark but colorful at the same time. The dialogue is very strange in the film, very spacy and monotone. But I love it because I love David lynch and that is his technique in most films.   I mean there's really no negatives here unless you are just not in to creative movies. I really wish that their were more people out there that knew how to make art. The movie starts off pretty slow but once he realizes he has to take charge of the situation. The gore fest is on and the action is just none stop and interesting. This film definitely doesn't hand it all to you on a platter you have to put it all together. I certainly hope this director is nominated for at least cinematography or story. I haven't felt a movie in along time and I actually felt this movie. It really had me in a certain mind frame and mood due to the way the music was and the over all Ora of the film. The soundtrack is another thing that really did it for me. Its sounds like a mix of DaftPunk and some Andreas Kleerup type music. Almost like foreign electro pop or synth tripped out music. This type of genre is  rarely used anymore since the 90's which really said a lot for the director. Do not hesitate if you are a artistic intelligent person. Mindless action fanatics and easily entertained people.. move along.  This one isn't for you and stop bashing great films.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Just received my Kindle Fire Lightweight MicroShell Folio Cover by Marware in Black and I love it!  It is exactly the style of case I wanted. It is thin and the cover folds back completely out of the way -- both absolute requirements.   With the elastic strap holding the cover out of the way I can also slip my fingers in to get a better grip.  I definitely recommend watching the video if you have any questions about the case.  P.S. Someone on Ravelry.com was able to buy this on sale. I was not able to catch the same sale but was able to use the brief $5 off KSO ad (Kindle with Special Offers for my K3) plus had some Amazon points. I hope it goes on sale for others because the price went up (now $29).   PROS:  * slim - adds minimal thickness  * Kindle Fire snaps in easily  * built-in horizontal viewing stand prop (by folding the cover into the back groove)  CONS:  * few color choices - color may be fun but with a case that fits this snug it would be superfluous  * no place for me to tuck in my stylus (but maybe I can create a clip or velcro spot on the vertical top)
B006BXTOFC|5.0|This could be the best Black Keys album yet, and it is definitely the tightest album the group has released thus far. I would match up tracks like \\"Lonely Boy,\\" \\"Gold on the Ceiling,\\" \\"Little Black Submarines,\\" and \\"Hell of a Season\\" to ANY tracks on any of the group's former albums. Do yourself a favor and check out this album.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I had heard some good reviews on this show from both friends and professional critics---i had enjoyed Michael C Hall's acting on Six Feet Under.  I was a bit wary about the premise of the show,though--a forensic crime professional who commits murders????  WEll, i bought the first season and watched it practically nonstop !!!!  I haven't been so entertained by a show in years!  Michaels character is beyond quirky in many respects, and his acting is superb,as usual!  Shocking,funny and offbeat.....love it!  There arent many gross scenes ,either...jsut a spattering of blood here and there.....i recommend it to anyone who has a any sense of humor and enjoys and appreciates something original--with offfbeat peculiar characters....Kudos to the writers of the show ,also!!
1423140591|1.0|I read The Son of Neptune aloud to my son and he loved it.  He read it on his<br />own and loved it.  He is ill, so we bought the audio version today to give<br />him a distraction when he is in pain.  What a waste of $31!  Swanson reads<br />as...though...he...is...talking...to...a...moron,...speaking...one...word...at<br />...a...time, and with all the expressiveness of a pickle.  Professional<br />actors, not professional enunciators, should record audio books. Don't throw your<br />money away.  Buy the book, not the recording.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|I don't uaually review products here on Amazon (although I do purchase quite a bit here lol) but this controller deserves a review since it is probably the best third party controller I have ever used.  First off let me say that I am  not an avid FPS player and have just gotten into playing the CoD series so I am not an expert at perfect aiming controls, but for me this controller works great CoD and I imagine it will work great on future FPS games I play. I dont sense any 'deadzone' and I love the how the analog sticks are alittle \\"looser\\" than official PS3 controller.  The controller has lot of great features. It sports a rubberized body with mesh hand grips, rubber analog sticks that have the indent perfect for your thumbs, light up buttons (which are rather bright), and the size is perfect for someone seeking a larger controller similar to the XBox controller; especially since the analog sticks are offset like the XBox controller. The controller also sports all the features of the current DUALSHOCK controllers: rumble, SIXAXIS (big deal), and it's rechargable and  wireless.  All that is required for the controller to work is that you plug in its accompanied USB plug (which is also where you charge it) and it's good to go. All in all I'm really enjoying the controller: it handles great, offers smooth controls, and has all the features of an official controller for half the price.

B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Been looking for a an app like this for the churin to play with - best I've found. Works great on the Gtab - pretty amazing actually. Very intuitive, much easier than Paint, etc. Looks like you can export your work(?). Great app, especially for free.

B000002H33|5.0|i got this cd as a gift in 6th grade along with panteras vulgar display of power. i always liked metal before.. stuff like mudvayne or korn(i was ten, give me a break). let me say..these two albums changed my life forever and got me into music like it was no ones business. since then i have collected over 600 cds.. metal, classic rock, etc. this one still reigns as one of my favorite cds ever. not just in the metal genre but all of them. its that good. it still sounds fresh to this day. (im 23 now and graduated college). i would say getting into classic rock really got me to appretiate the older metal. the sabbath, judas priest, metallica, pantera,etc. i loved these bands b4 but now i can appretiate them to the fullest. long live heavy metal. the only genre that hasent ever went away.
B001L5J5GI|5.0|I love this album and happen to have two of them.  One of them has never been opened.  Anyone interested?
B000002NG7|4.0|just finished listening to this cd. for the year 1997 it might have been album of the year... its a great album worth purchasing or having in your music collection... is it a classic?no. is it there best, or my favorite album?, no. but any faith no more cd is worth owning. mike patton can have u feeling all sorts of emotions with his vocal style. or should i say styles. anyways, buy this album.. also check out there other cds.. and mr bungle of course. patton is a manianc on vox
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this app daily on pretty much every device I have.  I use it to jot down notes mainly.  I like that it automatically in sync with my other devices (phone, kindle fire, laptop, home pc).  To a lesser extent I use it for checklists. I build a shopping list when I start running low on day to day stuff at my house and when I go to the store I have everything with me ready to go.  Great for making shopping list for birthdays/Christmas, have the kids (or adult...  =D) fill it out on the computer and you'll have it everywhere you go.  I can say enough about this app, it's got everything you could want in a note taking app in a very easy to use format.

B005DKLPF6|4.0|Much as I hate to admit it, I keep expecting Mastodon's next album to be the one that sucks. I worship Blood Mountain, and I thought Crack the Skye was amazing as well, and I did not see a way for them to top it.  Well, The Hunter is an entirely different beast. Gone are the thirteen minutes plus songs- no song clocks in at over six minutes. Rather than richly layered, almost dream-like brooding soundscapes, the songs simply kick in, do what they have to do, and make way for the next song. It is an almost flawless display of musical virtuosity from beginning to end. Track by track:  1. Black Tongue: The first song I heard from the album, and the one that made me knew it was going to be another good one. It shows Mastodon emerging as more of a hard rock than a metal band, but managing to be just as brutal and leaving just as much of an impact. I love Troy's roar of \\"you took the diamond!\\"  2. Curl of the Burl: I have to admit that I didn't like this song at first, but it's grown on me. It's a relatively short, almost bluesy song, beginning with the funniest line Mastodon every wrote: \\"I killed a man, cause he killed my goat.\\"  3. Blasteroid: A short, brutal song. The closest genre I can think of to put it on is hardcore punk. Not the most memorable song on the album, but excellent nonetheless.   4. Stargasm: Don't let the title deceive you; this is one of the most complex, beautiful songs Mastodon has written, and is one of the two or three best on the album. Echoes of Pink Floyd can be found throughout the music and lyrics. Listen and tremble.  5. Octopus Has No Friends: It might sound like radio-friendly hard rock, but it doesn't matter; it's the best radio friendly hard rock I've ever heard. Not my favorite on the album, but one of the better ones.  6. All the Heavy Lifting: Simply an awesome hard rock song. Troy's vocal range is amazing on this one. One of the best.  7. The Hunter: Very different from the others, and we're the better for it. The album has been dominated by Troy so far, but Brent kicks in with his strange, vulnerable vocals, singing about his deceased brother. You will find echoes of the Beatles and others in this beautiful song.  8. Dry Bone Valley: It took a while to grow on me, but this is my favorite song on the album. Brann, the drummer, takes lead vocals here, and I wish he did it more often. It gives me chills when he says \\"I came to, and I was running from you!\\"  9. Thickening: Another one of the best on the album. It has the best mixture of brutality and melody to be found on the album.  10. The Creature Lives: I have to admit, this song has never grown on me. Brann takes the vocals once again, but it ends up being mostly confusing and uninteresting.  11. Spectrelight: Yes! The most hard-hitting song on the album. Scott Kelly (Blood and Thunder, Crack the Skye, Crystal Skull) takes lead vocals here. It's short, brutal and beautiful.  12. Bedazzled Fingernails: Another great example of a mixture of hard-hitting rock and melody. The chorus, and what it erupts into, is the songs highlight.  13. The Sparrow: Nearly surpasses Pendulous Skin as the bands most beautiful album closer, especially for its sad, vulnerable feel. You can feel their pain of losing a friend.  Simply put, this is likely to be the best hard rock album of the year, and I can't wait to see what Mastodon does next.

0765348276|5.0|Really top-notch.  This is probably one of the best sci-fi books I've read in the last few years.    If you are interested in being re-born in a younger body, turning green, and then hooking up with your \\"old\\" wife who is also in a new body, then this book is for you.  Future technology has made it possible to transfer your consciousness into a fresh new body.  In this case, our main character succeeds, but his wife passes away before her mind can be transferred.  He meets her new body only to find out that it really isn't her - her clone is a new person without the old memories.  And this is a bad thing how?  My wife remembers everything!  Dude - this guy can start over with a clean slate.  Remember that time you forgot our anniversary?  Nope!  Remember that time you bought me a frying pan for my birthday?  Nope!  Remember that time you called me a (blank)?  Nope!  This guy has it made.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|I gave it a chance. I really did. I listened to it once all the way through without skipping a song. Then I waited a few hours and tried again. Then I waited 2 days and tried again. Then I went to the record store and tried to sell it back. I didn't care they didn't give me much. I wanted to get rid of it. And I never get rid of cds. There is nothing good about this. The music is boring. The lyrics are terrible. It sounds like it's about to do something awesome the whole time, but keeps failing miserably. If you are a Metallica fan, don't bother. If you're a Lou Reed fan, don't bother. I hope this is the only pressing they ever do of this album and that they take all the copies that a great number of people are now selling back to record stores and recycle them into t-shirts that say \\"Erase Lulu From Your Memory.\\"
B004EPYZU8|2.0|What the heck did I just watch?  This movie is senseless.  In a nutshell, the hero does various dirty dance routines (presumably - because we never actually see the dances) in order to distract people so that her friends can steal a series of items in order to escape some sort of mental institution that doubles as a brothel.  Got all that?  Why don't we see the dances you ask?  Because whenever a dance starts our hero goes into a fantasy trance and we are transported into a dream sequence where her and her fellow dancers take on zombie Nazis, dragons, robots, etc.  For example, one of the items that they need to steal is a lighter.  Therefore, the fantasy sequence involves the squad of women cutting the throat of a baby dragon, ripping out two fire crystals, and then a chase sequence with the mother dragon.    I'll admit that the fantasy parts are pretty well done.  However, after the first two I found myself asking - \\"Is this all there is?  Do I have to go through this two or three more times?\\"  In that sense, I suppose Sucker Punch is a lot like a vasectomy.  The first one is a bit of a surprise, but the second one usually hurts a little more.  Party because you know what to expect... partly because... well... it's a vasectomy.  Sucker Punch was just like that.  The first cut scene was a bit of a surprise, but then you get through it and have to endure the second one.  Unfortunately, there are more than two in this case and no warm towel to soften you up!  This movie made me want to spend two days sitting on an ice pack.  In the end, I just wondered what the point was.  This movie was just barely good enough so that I didn't turn it off.  That's the only reason it gets two stars instead of one.  One star is reserved for absolute trash like GI Joe.    You know how you can really tell how bad this movie is?  By how much many of the 5 star reviewers spend their time defending it.  Uhhhh... If it was five stars, it would speak for itself, right?  Apparently not, because many 5 star reviews spend time advising everyone how they \\"don't get it\\" etc, etc.  Yes, yes, yes... the critics were wrong, the poor reviewers are wrong... blah, blah, blah.  You, my 5 star friend, are the only genius to see the magnificence of this film and the rest of us are just inbred and toothless dolts.    Now give me a Bud and let me go sit in my recliner.

B004WGGQPQ|4.0|Simple easy to use interface. Nice selection of tools. Perfect for regular peeps wanting to doodle and pass the time with their kids. brush/crayon/marker tip size adjustment would be nice. As it is now, there is only a fat brush or skinny brush.
B0057R5G6E|5.0|I really love it!! the T-rex statue is made very well and it is just awesome and it's setting next to my other statues. In my opinion since I am a Jurassic Park fan I think it's really epic!! :D... the blu ray is awesome as well :)..
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|Almost perfect. Great brushes, very responsive, and the interface should be used to show other developers how to do it right! If you could blend the colors after applying them, this would beat many drawing apps for Desktops. Nice!

0143038583|5.0|This book is amazing.  It takes you on a culinary journey. The detailed process of how your food gets to your table and what it is made out of is shocking, horrifying and enlightening. Since reading this book I have changed the way I eat entirely. I was always fairly healthy but I am much more conscious of where I get my food from and I have enjoyed this change--from eating take out to preparing my own food from the farmers market and local grocery store. It's very well written, detailed, interesting and life changing. What more is there to say.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this is very accurate and easy to read. I like that it has the map for the radar in motion.

1451627289|5.0|I absolutely could not put this book down.  I read it in the Kindle format and ran the battery down a few times while reading.  The premise is great and the research King has done is evident throughout the entire book. Lots of things that he writes about I actually remember and this made the book even more enjoyable.    Don't want to write anything about the book because all a prospective reader needs to know is that someone wants to stop the Kennedy assassination.  Just start reading.
B005KJZDXK|2.0|I really wanted to like this. I love Zooey's voice, and the whole idea of her singing Christmas caroles just sounded magical ... but the music sounds thin and, despite being happy songs, her voice sounds so melancholy. It's not quite the bopping, upbeat music I wanted to wrap presents to. Too bad.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|Program works very well on a tablet and/or phone.  It is just not very realistic how the different brushes work and your options are limited.  Great for kids.  Just don't expect to create works of art with this.
B000PXUA5W|5.0|I was looking for a nice watch for my 9-yr old cousin. Came across this watch, and just loved it. Even though some reviews were not so encouraging, I decided to invest in it. In fact, the design seemed so unique, decided to get one for myself :)<br />There are plenty of pieces to make a big wrist band and easily customized. Even the kid size was good enough for me. After wearing steel watches for ages, this definitely feels very light, but I think would be good enough for kids.<br /><br />I found that each connection has a broad side and a narrow side, if you join the pieces by inserting the narrow end and then rotating, it keeps the pieces well locked together. But if you try to insert the broader side, it may cause the connection end to enlarge over time, that may cause the pieces to fall apart.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />The watch I got for my cousin broke within a couple of months but mine still works...So I am not sure who to blame :)
B005K17RU0|4.0|I think its smoother than some of the \\"standard\\" weather apps and has yet to crash.  This app also has radar, as others do not. This is a good thing.

B0000DZEE3|3.0|To me the Chili Peppers were at their creative peak with 2002's By The Way.  Case in point: the last track on that release, Venice Queen, is every good as it's more famous cousins that lead off the CD.  The Slane Castle concert, following on the heels of that recording and featuring it's music along with earlier hits and a few covers, shows the Chilis at their most entertaining best: great musicianship, a frenzied and passionate performance, and a signature blend of rock and funk and harmony that has endeared them to a mass audience.  In the breathtaking atmosphere of the Slane Castle site, the Chili Peppers electrify the massive crowd of Irish youth throughout this performance.  The highlight for me: John Frusciante's blistering and complex performance on lead guitar, amply displaying why he is rated one of the all-time greats.  Add to him Anthony Keidis' intense rapping and wherling dervish presence, Flea's master-of-the-base agility and amusing antics, and Chad Smith's beaming perfection on drums and you have a concert performance that will send chills up your spine.  This is rock and roll heaven and when it's over you'll have only one thought: I wish I had been there!!  So while the concert itself deserves 5 stars, I've been very disappointed that after only a couple of viewings my DVD has started skipping while being played.  I have great equipment and no issues with anything else, so I really have to question the quality of production of this product.  I'm bummed about this; thus the 3-star rating.  5 for the concert; 1 for the DVD quality.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|A lot of people have expressed concern ordering this based on some of the early low reviews. I was concerned too but when it dropped from the original $40 to $30 I ordered one. I don't think it's worth $40. If I'm paying that much I'd better be getting the leather case. But for $30 this is a really good case.<br /><br />The back is a nice thick, hard plastic (which is coated in a thin layer of rubber) that secures the Kindle Fire perfectly. Unlike the leather case I got for my Kindle 3G which holds the Kindle with metal brackets that slide into the Kindle itself (and nearly broke my Kindle when my son tried to open it the wrong way), the Kindle Fire just snaps into this case. The video above is worth watching to see how it works. The cover is great too. The top is rubber (or something like it), but underneath (the part that touches the screen) is a nice, soft felt-like fabric. It feels like the same kind of fabric that's on the inside cover of my Kindle 3G leather case. I love that because since I often like to rest these devices on my leg while I'm reading, so when they're open with the cover folder back they don't slide off my leg. It's a small thing, but I like it. The elastic band that holds the cover either open or closed works great too. Sure it's glued in but it doesn't seem like it's going to go anywhere with the Fire inserted into the case so tight.<br /><br />The cover folds back into a stand as described and it works well enough. I haven't and probably won't use it much, but the more I've put it in that position the better it works. And yes, the Fire NEEDS to be in the case for the stand to work. It needs the weight to hold it in place.<br /><br />One minor issue. I have noticed that the rubber coating of the back is starting to wear off in the corners. That could be problematic. The rubber coating keeps it from sliding around on a table. If that wears off then that aspect of protection is gone. But for now it's not bad.<br /><br />So is this a 1 star case? I don't think so. But I can understand the disappointment if people paid $40+ dollars for it and expected more. But at $30 you really can't beat this case.e? I don't think so. But I can understand the disappointment if people paid $40+ dollars for it and expected more. But at $30 you really can't beat this case.
B005OGYH90|4.0|I am usually not a fan of live material, mainly due to the parts where the the artist has the crowd sing.  I'm paying for the artist to sing, not my peers on the floor. There is not enough of that to bother me on this album. I heard parts of this album prior to it being released, and I knew it would be worth picking up, and I am not dissapointed.  The mastering on it is fantastic, the tracklist is excellent, and Slash, Myles Kennedy, and the rest of the band really nailed it on this night. It almost sounds like a studio recording at times as dead on as Slash is getting some of the parts of songs like Civil War and Ghost.  I think the bonus DVD is alright, but as others have said, I wish it would have been the full show instead of the 5 tracks, but some are better than none.  Definately a must for any G'N'R' fan or a fan of good hard rock n roll.

And the book was boring...
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Besides being a tremendously smart and even emotional film, it's also refreshing to see a lead hero be just that... a hero. Steve is no morbid vigalante or narcissitic self absorbed anti-hero. He's the real deal. His tough life hasn't made him bitter or jaded. In fact, it's done just the opposite. He's needed to develop character because his body didn't develop. This is the key to Cap both in the books and in the film. Heart and character trump the physical elements and are what truly makes the character itself special. Even after he's given the great gift of being a \\"super soldier,\\" he still continues to do the right thing. It's not to prove anything to anyone other than himself because he has a high moral code. I love the fact that they choose his character for the experiment because he wouldn't take advantage of the gift. That's smart writing. Cap's first assignment from the U.S. government is to be the centerpiece in a traveling USO show, building morale and raising money for the war effort. Eventually, he finds he's wasting his new abilities and NEEDS to break away on his own to fight the Nazi menace. This brings him to conflict with the awesomely diabolical Red Skull. The Skull is one of Marvel's best crazed villains and they captured that perfectly. Here, the Red Skull was a guinea pig for a similar Nazi super soldier experiment that went very wrong. These clashes and confrontations are everything they should be and more.  Shades of gray are great in film (and there are those tones present here) but sometimes it's good to have character of pure heart, pure integrity and true morality take it to what history and everyone knows was pure evil.  It's refreshing to sit back and root for the ultimate good to take it to the ultimate bad guys. It's why I loved Raiders of the Lost Ark and it's why I now love this film.
B00000K3D4|5.0|This, in my opinion, is one of the best fantasy films ever made! I honestly can't stop watching it!!!  I really wish Jim Henson would have gotten the chance to do more films like this and The Dark Crystal.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|The developers truly thought of everything.  As others have mentioned, it's very responsive, which makes it very easy and a lot of fun to use.  The variety of tools (paint brushes, crayons, stamps, stickers, paper, etc.) is awesome.  The best part, in my opinion, is the color selection provided.  All of the tools are available in a large range of colors (some more than others), but all of the tones and shades look amazing together.  No two colors really clash or look garish, so no matter what you draw, the colors still look harmonious.  Thank you to the developers for their artistic sense and forethought.  Two things on my wishlist for this: realistic blending of paint colors (there is some already for single colors) and for the stickers to be &quot;undo-able&quot; without having to select/recycle.  Minor conveniences that don't really affect enjoyment of the program as-is.  Overall, this is an amazing art app that's fun and appropriate for all ages and skill levels.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This is by far one of the best creative apps I've used. Opened and started using it immediately. Tools are so easy to use--select and open the drawer for all the colors and sizes you want! It's fast! Well thought out application.
B005LJK3AC|2.0|I am a huge fan of bawdy, gross-out comedies by directors such as Judd Apatow and the Farrelly Brothers. I watched the bathroom scene in Hall Pass about 10 times, laughing until I wept. In fact, I would have sworn that no amount of coarseness, vulgarity, bad taste, or political incorrectness could interfere with my enjoyment of movie.....until I watched Horrible Bosses.<br /><br />What a colossal disappointment! Each of the cast members has been outstanding in at least one previous comedy; but, with the exception of old pro Kevin Spacey, each was dismally inept in this one. Most of all, I cannot imagine what motivated Jennifer Anniston to accept the utterly thankless role of a revolting, foul-mouthed nymphomaniac. Is her career in such a decline that this was the best she could do? When a beautiful woman spouts filth, it has to be convincing; but in this case it was more a source of embarrassment (for her) than titillation. It was like watching a close friend get drunk and humiliate themselves in public, while you wince at their idiotic behavior and pray that you can eventually erase it from your memory. In this case, I don't think I can.<br /><br />When you get a group of proven, talented actors together and the result of their collaboration is pure trash, the responsibility must fall upon the script, the director, or both. Granted, there were a few glimmers of humor in the production, but they were smothered by long periods of boredom and slathered with gratuitous vulgarity that simply was not funny. If a character's role contains inadequate humor, like that of Jamie Foxx, then simply give him an outrageous name and repeat it over and over and over. The entire script reeked of Junior High School locker room humor and lacked any degree of finesse or underlying wit. Surely the majority of those involved in this production recognized its significant shortcomings, yet it was released, or should I say, inflicted, upon the public in its current form.<br /><br />The bottom line: any amount of crassness and vulgarity can be tolerated or even enjoyed if it is genuinely funny. Without attendant humor, it quickly degenerates into boredom and disgust. Such was the case with this very disappointing production. It should be noted that over 100 reviewers hated this movie even more than I did, and gave it only one star. This many people can't all be wrong.....for your own sake, please heed our warning.
B005VR9328|5.0|This is not only the best hip-hop album of the year, it is the best album of the year period. This should be nominated for album of the year for the next Grammy's because The Roots have outdone themselves. I can't remember them ever releasing a bad album and on this release they continue that trend and even one-up themselves.
1582701709|5.0|This is one of the best books that I have ever read, I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.
B002VLP81M|5.0|This book is a classic! It was my favorite Dr. Seuss book when I was a little girl. I remember making my mom read it to us and laughing so hard when she couldn't get through the tongue twisters. She laughed so hard she cried. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to read and spend time with their kids and who loves to laugh with them!
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|There are lots of drawing programs, but not many with intuitive menus and tools for younger children. Love how you access the colors and different writing implements.  Got this for free as the free app of the day but would have paid for this in a heartbeat for my daughter if I had known it was out there.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|its fun for the kids, and adults alike. putting a picture would be nice. the control panel is very easy to use.

B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This is by far the best drawing app I have tried.  Everything is great: the interface, the graphics, the selection of tools (markers, pensils, stamps, stickers, and more).<br /><br />I am using it on my Toshiba Thrive and I am very happy with this app.  Definitely recommend, especially if you have kids.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|No autotune, no hype - thank God. With the entire pop music industry going down a slippery slope into a vortex of scum, Adele is the pinicle of a rare few who actually display class and talent. No tats to speak of, no shards in her lips, no dressing up like a circus act just one hell of a voice and song writing talent. I have heard that young people are taken with her and maybe, just maybe, they will begin to see that to be really unique, free, and different, you have to go against the flow and truly be your own person. In 2011 there is nothing more lemming-like than to paint your body, pierce yourself with cheap hardware, and spike your noggin-hair. Yet \\"artist\\" after \\"artist\\" come along and sport this contrived image and then sing through another contrivance (autotune) and then pen lyrics that amount to some goofy repetition of some meaningless sophmoric phrase. For God's sake somehow, someway music has to return to music, to art and get away from being a forum for gangsta, thug, rump-humping displays of lowbrow sideshow culture.    Adele on the other hand needs no showbiz distraction to take your eye off the talent search. You listen to her, you have found the real deal. Yes, I agree with some others that her influences are very apparent and she has not surpassed the likes of Aretha, but she is bringing back the focus on real talent and for that she deserves a thousand Grammys.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|A wonderful app from a Dev that clearly considered a user-friendly interface well worth the time to develop. Thanks for a wonderfully fun and well thought out app!
0060873027|1.0|Absolutely, incredibly horrible. Definitely not a 'real' Crichton _ his contributions don't seem to have gone much beyond the title, with the writing style on par with a bad SyFy movie.  It starts with a probmising, intriguing first chapter, then turns to absolute by-the-numbers drek that is truly painful to read and seems a complete bait-and-switch compared to the what you see in the first chapter and the dust jacket notes.  Remember 'Land of the Giants'? How about 'Incredible Voyage' (the cheesy movite, NOT the novel)?  Take both of them, put them in a blender, feed them to your dog, and what comes out is 'Micro'.  Avoid at all costs.
B00479SVBU|1.0|Got this as a replacement for the Soundfly SD WMA/MP3, which failed within weeks. This one did no better.  Save your money.
B004P2CQM4|1.0|Got this thinking it would be great for my kids to watch me use and as a novelty for the family. Took me well over an hour to put it together, and the fact that the fins are all labeled with the wrong letters that don't match up with any of the markings on the main body of the fish doesn't help. The adhesive doesn't stick and the reinforcing tape is worthless. I ended up using clear duct tape to secure all the parts. After getting it all put together and filled with helium, I go to the last step, which is to plug the wire that runs along the bottom of the fish into the tail assembly, only to find that the tiny little phone battery like plug is missing and only to little wires with little , and I mean little clips attached. After all that work, and now I can't even use this thing! Contacted the company and told them this and there response was to send it back. This thing is fully inflated and 4 feet long. The only way it was going back is if I took a knife to it! I was able to gerry rig the wires using a magnifying glass and make the tail fin work. I have to say despite all the snags it seemed kind of cool, except that I bought the EXTREME MODEL RADIO CONTROL which is supposed to be used up to 50 FEET! What a crock, you will be lucky if you get 7 feet. This product seems really great, but in the end; just another piece of crap made in China. Don't waste your money!
0553582038|4.0|The whole collection is readable and entertaining, although I found some books better than others. The author is a bit of a sadist, \\"killing\\" many of the most likeable characters, and the \\"baddies\\" are really bad. I do not hesitate in recommendig this novel.
0307959856|1.0|I'm no deconstructionist; what Jane Austen says, goes. From that point of view, this book is replete with errors of \\"fact,\\" or of \\"fict,\\" if you will. To give only one example, Mr. Collins is called Mr. Bennet's nephew; in fact, he is Mr. Bennet's cousin. I found three such errors in as many pages.  These irritants to a Janeite would not be fatal in a rollicking good read. Unfortunately, we don't have a rollicking good read here. The mystery angle is in some ways incredibly obvious; the reader guesses parts of it immediately. Other parts come into the \\"had-I-but-known\\" category. No clever reader can figure them out, as can a really clever reader of Agatha Christie. With Christie you generally kick yourself for having missed the obvious. But, in this book, at least, James cheats.  The comedy-of-manners angle is a terrible disappointment. James presents two suitors for Georgiana Darcy's hand, but there is virtually no conflict. No pride. No prejudice. No mixed feelings. Georgiana likes the obviously likable young man best, and there are no red herrings that seem to point to him as the murderer, and no stains on his character. The other suitor is wholly uninteresting except that he does some seemingly inexplicable things after the murder. But he's not guilty either, and, anyway, Georgiana likes the other guy. No surprises. There is no witty dialog, there are no obervations on the human condition, no noshing, no dancing, no hidden agenda. It's as dry as sawdust. Darcy and Elizabeth have been married six years, but their relationship has not evolved since the day of their engagement.  I have no ax to grind. I really am sorry to say this. I thought James would write a great P&P sequel and I took the trouble to order this book from England so I wouldn't have to wait for American publication. I can't recommend it.
1423140591|5.0|This book was the bomb! I absolutely loved it, and honestly, I could not stop reading this book! Highly recomend this book.
B0014JLYS8|4.0|Within the first two weeks of having the Croc's Bistro's I can tell you a few things. They are very light weight, and extremely comfortable. I have back and neck issues so being on my feet all day I dont need them aggravated with bad shoes, or having sore feet added to the other issues. I will tell you these are great if you're on your feet all day A++++  The one negative was that the soles are actually seperating from the shoe, they are glued in place both front and the heel. Both heels are separating from the shoes in the back. I contacted Crocs customer service who had me send in my receipt and two pictures of the problem. A week later I had a brand new pair at my from door. Crocs is awesome!!  Overall an excellent choice for folks who spend the majority of their day on their feet 8)
B001HN6922|2.0|If you are an adult and like James Bond movies with a touch of Transformers action, you'll like Cars 2. For everybody else, this movie was just wrong. As has been said by other reviewers, this movie drops everything good about the original one: the characters, the setting, the mood, the pace, the soul. My five- and three-year old daughters -- great fans of the first installment -- got up and walked away 20 minutes into the movie. Looks good, but no soul.

B005QBKXOQ|4.0|I wanted to wait a couple of weeks before writing this review, so all of the songs could sink in.  I hate when people write a review after listening to an album once or twice.  As it stands right now, I've probably listened to this CD all the way through 15 times.  Pretty much every day since it came out.<br /><br />This is a fantastic album.  I absolutely loved \\"Leave This Town\\", so I won't say that this album is better, but it's definitely in the same league anyway.<br /><br />Daughtry gets a lot of flack for putting out your standard \\"Verse, Chorus, Verse, Bridge, Verse\\" kind of song.  I don't see what's wrong with that, as long as the music and content of the songs are good.  It's not like this is bubble gum pop without any meaning or soul.  These songs are deep, catchy, and fun to listen to.  Anyone who criticizes this album for being too plain needs to get the rod out of their butthole.<br /><br />Standout songs for me on the album are: Renegade, Crawling Back To You, Outta My Head, Start of Something Good, Break The Spell, We're Not Gonna Fall, and Spaceship.  I just realized I put 7 of the 12 songs on my \\"Standout\\" songs, lol.  Yes, it's THAT good of an album.<br /><br />My only beef with this is the \\"Deluxe\\" version of the album.  The songs that didn't make the cut aren't very good.  \\"Leave This Town\\" had several B-Sides that were actually better than most of the songs on the album.  But these B-Sides stink, and aren't even worth listening to.  As big of a Daughtry fan as I am, I have to say that the extra songs are pretty bad.<br /><br />I don't want to end this review on a down note.  This is a GREAT album, and I urge you to BUY this album!  Yes, BUY it.  Chris Daughtry is a good dude, and I felt very comfortable buying 2 copies of this CD and putting some money in his pocket.

0446547654|2.0|I absolutely love Nicholas Sparks, HOWEVER, this book was a real disappointment.  I look forward every year to pre-ordering his new release.  I hope his next book is better.  Not sure what happened with this one.  It was almost as though he had to get a book out and rushed through it.  Again, very disappointing.
0553801473|1.0|This is absolutely the worst book I have read in my life.  I actually gave the book away about 200 pages before the end.  Yes, I am serious, and yes, the book is that bad.  I have been a long time GRRM fan.  I wasn't that pleased with Feast for Crows and absolutely hated ADWD.  I am through with the series and there was absolutely no progression of the storyline with this novel.  That may be agrued but the story did not progress at all.<br /><br />Dead Story!!!!!!

B002T9H2LK|5.0|Given his bizarre, genre-twisting reputation, Quentin Tarantino's \\"Inglourious Bastereds\\" impresses most with its decidedly old-fashioned suspense scenes!<br /><br />Everyone knows about Christoph Waltz, but to me the real standout performance here is Melanie Laurent as the cinema proprietor, a real study in subtlety and total immersion in a role.  And of course Brad Pitt is a reliable crowd-pleaser as Aldo Raine (Fave moment: When Pitt, already in close-up, leans forward and says \\"Ah WILL have mah SCALPS!\\"  Terrific)<br /><br />This is as good as everyone says, and makes for a magnificently entertaining movie night.  One you'll long remember.
B003NX76BM|4.0|!Spoiler Alert!<br />This book was good, but I'm not sure if this was a dog training manual or a romantic suspense.  I swear I learned so much about training dogs that I may use this as a training manual.  LOL!  The funny part is I always wanted a Lab or a Golden Retriever and this book was all about Labs.  Now I really want one; Fiona's dogs were really smart.  Simon kind of got on my nerves, but he grew on me. It just felt like the romantic/suspense was 2nd to Fiona's dog training.  Other than that this book was okay.  :)

0312430000|3.0|As a Developer, I realize that life has become so complicated, that I want to give best product as possible, and on time. Atul, is not the first one to come to realization that checklists are the way to go, however, he has written about his experiences brilliantly.  Simple checklists are used more often than the author surmises, though they are not named as such. For example, in my work, software, our project management timelines are essentially checklists. When I go hiking, the leader provides a list of dos and don'ts, and a list of safety items to bring. These are checklists. When assigned a new project, I note down important steps. If I had to do a similar project again, I use this bullet list so I do not repeat mistakes and perform tasks faster.   This book also talks about inter-personal communications.

It contains detailed explanation about the delivery stage, which is one of three steps of presentation: preparation, design, and delivery.

Project yourself  5. Begin with a punch. End with a powerful finish  6. Have pace in your presentation.  It is easy to read, and a must read book.

0307455378|2.0|It's always difficult to pull off a coherent story that includes time shifting and supernatural characters. With this novel I'd have to say \\"nice try\\". I read this in Spanish without difficulty (I have a C1 level in Spanish now), although it was a rather exhausting process: the book is almost 700 pages and Zafón's florid descriptions often seemed gratuitous. The most difficult part however was being able to suspend disbelief: the protagonist's ignorant complicity with \\"el patrón\\", coupled with the patrón's evil omnipotence were just too much to swallow. These considerations, together with Zafóns typical dark tone and trademark turns-of-phrase (\\"tragué saliva...\\"), were enough to have me swearing off Zafón for good, thank you.
0060936223|5.0|The book Just Kids is about Patti Smith and her lover/friend/accomplice Robert Mapplethorpe, the famous photographer of controversial images who died of AIDS in 1989. The book is relatively short, but contains many very nice photos and drawings of our young protagonists. The book recounts Smith's youth in rural New Jersey and her early years in New York, first as a destitute street kid, slowly working her way up in life, working in book stores, living in poverty, moving around Manhattan and Brooklyn until finally taking up a residency in the Chelsea Hotel and eventually becoming serious about her art. The musical voyage isn't explained very clearly, almost taken for granted - one minute she's plain old Patti Smith, the next she's got her own band (and what a band!).<br /><br />Meanwhile, Robert is going through his own travails, experimenting with his art, his sexuality, and drugs, experiencing several bouts of desperate sickness, eventually hustling his way through life, both literally and figuratively, all the while reinventing himself as an icon of the art world.<br /><br />The small things are the most valuable, like when Smith talks about books she bought, or sitting in a room, or making a cup of tea, or meeting famous people. She also reveals herself to be someone who remembers birthdays of family members, friends and influencers. But mostly I was happy to read a book where music is cited so often, especially that of the Rolling Stones - she describes listening to Beggar's Banquet endlessly, or attending the premiere of Ladies And Gentlemen, The Rolling Stones, a film I just bought on DVD.<br /><br />The start and the end of the book both deal with Mapplethorpe's death. The chronology of the book goes roughly up until 1975, dips a bit into 1978 and 1979, leaves out most of the 1980s entirely, as well as anything after Mapplethorpe's death. It is truly only the life of Patti Smith in the context of Robert Mapplethorpe, RIP.
0307472590|4.0|After swearing off Zafón based on his first two books, one of my Spanish teachers convinced me to give this one a try. I found it easy to read in Spanish (I have a B2-C1 level) and engaging. The characters are interesting and likeable, the story line coherent, and the resolution satisfying. Having recently read his next novel, El Juego del Ángel, I can definitely say that this is his best book.
1451648537|1.0|First and foremost, let me start out by stating that I am not an Apple fanatic, or even hobbyist.  I do own an iPhone and an iPod, but am a Windows PC and Android tablet guy.  That being said, I grew up in the wake of the 8 bit computer revolution and always found Jobs and Gates remarkable.  Jobs more so for the artistic side more than anything else.  Although not a fan, I will admit that at least in the realm of personal gadgets, Apple rules the roost.  That is one of the primary reasons I wanted to dive into this book, to see the method behind the scenes as Jobs steered Apple away from becoming a dominant player in the PC industry.  Unfortunately I should have looked closer before diving in as this was an extremely shallow attempt of documenting his life's work.  This book is more of the Cliff Notes version of a high level timeline than anything else.  Major changes in technology due to Jobs business decisions are all but glossed over in a few pages, or worse yet, left out entirely.  My 10 year old son's Diary of a Wimpy Kid book series contains more insight into a person's life than this book.  At the end of the read, and I mean a short read at that, I felt that I had visited a blogger's post instead of reading a biography.  In such a hectic world, taking time to sit down with a book and enjoy a good read is a rarity.  I could not believe that I had actually finished the book so quickly and was just stunned that so much detail left out.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not slighting the author on his style, just his lack of content.  If you're looking for something to burn through in an hour or so, by all means pick the book up.  I don't think you will walk away very satisfied however.
B00656C6KK|5.0|The US release of \\"My Heart\\", Doris Day's first album of new material in almost 20 years, is a cause to rejoice.<br /><br />When released overseas in September of 2011, the album immediately shot to the top of the British Charts. This made Miss Day the oldest person to have a top ten hit album of new material in history.<br /><br />\\"My Heart\\" contains 13 songs, most of which have never been heard before.<br /><br />Before his untimely death in 2004, Day's son, Terry Melcher, a highly successful songwriter and producer in the recording business for many years, had lured his mom back into the recording studio. For all intents and purposes, Day's singing since the late 60's had been limited to several well-received television specials in the 70's and songs rendered for a lucky few around her home.<br /><br />Melcher co-wrote four of the new songs in this collection of thirteen numbers, ten of which are new and three of which are classic Doris Day. Despite a span of decades since her vocal heyday, Day's voice on \\"My Heart\\" retains its unique warmth and distinctive flavor.<br /><br />Grammy winner Day's vocal skills are flawless.  Her diction, breath control and the warmth she projects when she sings, makes the listener feel she is singing directly to them.<br /><br />Best of the new songs include the catchy \\"Heaven Tonight\\", Day's take on the Lovin Spoonful's \\"Daydream\\", the Beach Boy's \\"Disney Girls\\", \\"Hurry It's Lovely Up Here\\" from the Broadway musical, \\"On a Clear Day You Can See Forever\\" and especially \\"You Are So Beautiful\\". A bonus track, not part of the earlier release in Europe, is \\"Stewball\\", arranged by Melcher and about a race horse.<br /><br />Written by Billy Preston, Bruce Fisher and Beach Boy Dennis Wilson, \\"You Are So Beautiful\\" became a huge hit for Joe Cocker in the 1970's. By the time Miss Day has sung the third note, she has made this song her own. It's a number you'll want to play again and again.<br /><br />Miss Day dedicates the haunting \\"Happy Endings\\", sung by Melcher, to her son.<br /><br />From the vault, Miss Day, who actively worked on all aspects of this album, has selected a number from her justifiably fabled Andre Previn album entitled \\"Duet\\". The song, \\"My One and Only Love\\" is brilliant. Miss Day also renders \\"My Buddy\\" and the definitive version of \\"Ohio\\" from the Broadway musical, \\"Wonderful Town\\". The Ohio native brings an added poignance and wistfulness to this beautiful tune.<br /><br />\\"My Heart\\" will please Miss Day's enormous legion of fans but it should also prove to be a wonderful introduction to those who are not familiar with the scope of Miss Day's recording career. To many, she only sang \\"Whatever Will Be, Will Be\\" (\\"Que Sera Sera\\") and a handful of other tunes. In reality, the Grammy-winning artist recorded more than 800 songs and is responsible for some of the most brilliant albums released by Columbia in the 1950's and 60's. Hopefully this new album will peak the interest of new listeners who will check out some of Miss Day's vast recording history and understand her justly renowned reputation as one of the finest vocalists in history.<br /><br />Your heart will beat just a bit faster as you enjoy, again and again, the long awaited return of a lady we have all missed very much - Doris Day.y worked on all aspects of this album, has selected a number from her justifiably fabled Andre Previn album entitled \\"Duet\\". The song, \\"My One and Only Love\\" is brilliant. Miss Day also renders \\"My Buddy\\" and the definitive version of \\"Ohio\\" from the Broadway musical, \\"Wonderful Town\\". The Ohio native brings an added poignance and wistfulness to this beautiful tune.  \\"My Heart\\" will please Miss Day's enormous legion of fans but it should also prove to be a wonderful introduction to those who are not familiar with the scope of Miss Day's recording career. To many, she only sang \\"Whatever Will Be, Will Be\\" (\\"Que Sera Sera\\") and a handful of other tunes. In reality, the Grammy-winning artist recorded more than 800 songs and is responsible for some of the most brilliant albums released by Columbia in the 1950's and 60's. Hopefully this new album will peak the interest of new listeners who will check out some of Miss Day's vast recording history and understand her justly renowned reputation as one of the finest vocalists in history.  Your heart will beat just a bit faster as you enjoy, again and again, the long awaited return of a lady we have all missed very much - Doris Day.

B005HSG3TC|5.0|I am not sure why there were so many bad reviews before people even had a chance to put their device in this case. I think the case works great! I love that it is so light and the stand feature works well. No difficulties.
B000244FDW|5.0|I had the pleasure of seeing this version when it first came out in the '80s.  By that time I had read P&P approximately 10 times and was very familiar with the story.  By far this is en pointe with the book.  The costuming, the scenes, the speed in which (or should I say, the non-speed the characters were portrayed was like one long Sunday afternoon sitting in the fields reading the book.  The whole story line just walked out of the books and came alive.  I believe D. Rintoul is my ideal Darcy - stately, handsome, aloof and very deep in thoughts. Each actor brought their character to life as close to Jane Austen's imagination as possible. I think she would have been very proud seeing them portrayed as they were in this BBC production.
B005URRCUY|5.0|I have been a huge Black Keys fan for quite some time, and while \\"El Camino\\" may not be my favorite of their albums, it is definitely worth picking up. It is important to note that, much like \\"Brothers,\\" this album represents a furthered progression of experimentation for which the Black Keys have been currently known. If you are strictly a fan of their earlier, heavy blues oriented rock, this album might come as a bit of a disappointment. However, if you enjoyed \\"Brothers,\\" I strongly suggest you give \\"El Camino\\" a shot. Though some critics and individuals have expressed displeasure with this album, claiming that its \\"too accessible,\\" don't be fooled. The Black Keys still know how to rock and prove it with \\"El Camino.\\"
B005GP7F8Y|3.0|Guys,  I,m not wanting to start an argument here,but I have to say,lets get a wee bit realistic here in the reviews of One Eyed Jacks blu-ray.  First of,aye,the blu-ray picture quality of OEJ leaves a LOT to be desired,and that,s me being kind,it is terrible for a blu-ray to have this kind of \\"picture quality\\"???? but that,s comparing it to other blu-rays!!!!!  Now,I was very lucky to purchase a reasonably good PQ,widescreen,dvd of OEJ in a sale bin in Orlando,2002,for $5,and I was delighted,because,every other dvd I had seen was,quite frankly,CRAP,even the tv showings left a lot to be desired,so,when I found out it was being released on blu-ray I had great \\"hopes\\",sadly this wasn,t to be,the blu-ray PQ was definitely sub-standard,HOWEVER,it,s a huge jump in PQ compared to the truly CRAP dvd,s we,ve had to put up with for all those years,and that,s how I,m \\"judging\\" OEJ,Blu-ray compared to DVD,and this blu-ray is a definite winner in that comparison.  I totally agree with one of the previous reviewers,One Eyed Jacks is definitely not going to get the same blu-ray treatment as some of the \\"new stuff\\",and it,s obvious that the print they,ve taken this transfer from is very dodgy,to say the least,so,lets be thankful that,for as bad as the PQ is,it,s much better PQ than the terrible dvd,s we,ve had to put up with.  Lastly,I,m old enough to remember seeing this first time around at the Cinema,it,s a great shame that this very undervalued,underrated western is receiving,well lets be frank,no treatment whatsoever!!!!!!!  I had a wry smile at the end of One Eyed Jacks blu-ray,thinking,OEJ was made in Vistavision,so was The Searchers!!!!  that,s where the blu-ray PQ comparison ends,so I aint disagreeing with the other reviews,I,m just asking for the blu-ray to be compared to the dvd,by the way,I bought my OEJ from amazon germany,it  cost me just over $10,including p&p,so,a better than dvd PQ of OEJ for $10-12,I can go with that.

B0053VKP8S|5.0|I got this for my appleTV to use with my Denon reciever. I wanted to use the AppleTV with my zone 2 speakers. Unfortunately, zone 2 requires an analog input. The AppleTV only outputs a digital signal. I used this and an optical cable. It works perfectly. I love it. Nice and small and simple to use.
B002RV01QI|5.0|Okay so since 1982, Enya has been shredding the charts of World music with her eloquence and grace.  Amazing doesn't even begin to describe the excellence of her sound. You can literally just sit, and be at peace with yourself amongst all the internal turmoil you might be feeling at the time. This album has some of the best classics by Enya, though missing a few of my personal favorites it really doesn't matter. I love it. I'm 20 years old and that alone should be able to show; Enya's music transcends time and will continue to do so long after her time.   Fantastic listen!

0439023521|5.0|I didn't have high expectations when I picked this up, but my best friend insisted it was an excellent read. And...she was right! I couldn't put this down. Great writing skills by Suzanne Collins and what a creative story. Loved it! Am just beginning book 2 and can't wait to see what happens next.
B005VA7OJE|5.0|As with the majority of the episodes of this series, this one is hilarious. They really hit the nail on the head in creating this series.

B004AYCWY4|5.0|An excellent book describing in a clear and entertaining way all the unrefutable scientific and logical reasons that the \\"Theory of Evolution\\" is fact.  If you are at all interested in chemistry, physics or biology this book is a must. Unfortunately the horrifyingly large percentage of Americans (40+%) that don't believe in evolution will not read this book.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I have seen some reviews claiming this case to be cheap plastic, this is simply untrue. The case is made of a ruggedised polycabonate polymer with a ruberised overcoat. This material is commonly found on ruggedised electronics used in the field. I have been useing this case since I received my Fire back at the beggining of November. In this time I have dropped my fire a few times including once screen down onto bluestone gravel (with the cover closed), and while the case has taken some damage, my fire is still looking fresh. I have seen some mention of the stand functions reliability, it is exactly like the stand on most of the ipad2 smart covers, which means it works great if you place it on a flat surface that is relatively stable (sorry its not earthquake proof). The weight of the fire keeps it stable and I have not had it fall over often, in those instances when it did fail to stay upright it was due to a jostling of the surface it was on and all that happened is the edge of the cover slipped out of the notch it goes intonand it fell to a face up \\"reading\\" position. In summary, good tough case for your fire.

B003YUC2FE|4.0|Just purchased this neat box set as an anniversary gift. Very eager to see her reaction to the iconic Andy's Toy Box! Within the last two days I've purchased the same Blu-Rays at two large chain stores for a MUCH larger price.  Despite the reviews of the toy box being \\"dinky\\" I would liek to think that it will be a blast fromt eh past each time we flip the lid for a marathon! One store $150 (All 3 just as the chest contains), Second store was a wee bit of a better price of only round $75 (All 3 but also included 3D Blu-Rays).  For $30 cheaper & unwilling to spend another $2k to get a 3D TV to replace my 50\\" LCD I think this is the wisest choice.  Can't Wait!
B005SV9X22|3.0|This is a great show but the original listing of this item, when I ordered it a week ago, stated that it was blu-ray. Now it seems to have been changed to DVD. Very disappointing.

B0034JKZ86|5.0|A delightful, musical romp with a twist on the \\"official\\" princess and the frog fairy tale. When Tiana kisses the frog, he doesn't turn (back) into a prince, Tiana turns into a frog! It's a great adventure as Tiana and the frog-prince try to avoid getting squashed or eaten as they journey into the swamp on their mission to find the wise woman who can undo the voodoo and make them human again. Set in the seductive, romantic dream that is New Orleans, drenched with jazz and voiced by some notable TV and movie actors, this is a story for all ages. Romance, adventure, nasty villains and dreams coming true - if you want these in your movie, along with it being suitable for children to watch - The Princess and the Frog is not to be missed![[ASIN:B0034JKZ86 The Princess and the Frog (Single-Disc Edition)]]
B004I2K4E8|5.0|I saw Les Miserables on Broadway close to reaching its tenth year. I bought the Blu-ray with the hope that it would somewhat emulate being in the seventh row center at an intimate Broadway theater. Truthfully that is something that can't be recreated in your home, but you can try to come close and that is what Blu-ray with its superb sound and picture can deliver. If your HD TV has a solid supporting sound system the resulting experience is pretty damn good.
B00275EHJG|4.0|All our favorite toys are back, facing peril again. Andy, their owner, is going to college. Now what's to become of his beloved toys? The answer to that is the usual grand adventure, with pitfalls and peril that seems so real it will keep you on the edge of your seat, I was! Sad to report, the 3rd Toy Story falls a little short of the trilogy's overall magic. Returning to the somewhat \\"dark\\" overtones of the original Toy Story, I found it a little scary for the very young, as I felt about the original. Toy Story 2 was better than the original, and for me, that still holds true. This time, the trash and the day care center are seen from the toys' viewpoint and is not as nice as it might sound. Through the machinations of a bitter teddy bear, they nearly get burnt up at the dump! Of course, Woody and Buzz wind up victorious by working together, and all their friends use their special talents to make it come out all right. There is a delightful scene near the end showing the magic of children's imagination  as they play with their toys. I truly enjoyed watching [[ASIN:B005ZMUTZ4 Toy Story 3]] and will again and again.

0321704452|4.0|\\"The Naked Presenter\\" really helped me think about ways to improve my presentation skills. The author's insights on storytelling, and depth vs. scope, can be easily applied to my own presentations. That was the real takeaway for me as I read this book.  More specifically, the author helped me understand the importance of arriving early, and engaging a few members of my audience beforehand in casual conversation, as a way to \\"get naked\\" and show my audience that I'm there for them. It is important to start strong and fast. Don't waste valuable time at the beginning with unnecessary, bland chatter. And in the end, bring it back to the beginning.  Mr. Reynolds asserts correctly that developing a presentation is not \\"technical.\\" The slides, visual aids, etc. come last. The development process is more ethereal than that. The author was adamant on this point that preparation starts in our minds as we formulate our thoughts and our \\"point.\\" Identifying and clarifying the presentation's primary purpose--the takeaways for our audience--supersede everything else during preparation. Do this first, and the rest will come.  \\"The Naked Presenter\\" is a great reference book. I will refer back to it often and I'll carry it with me in the future.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|As you probably figured withthe title of my review, I first tried this with broadcast HD TV signals and the sound was not good at all.  There was crackling, no surround and MAJOR echos; honestly I was about to send these back in exchange for something else.  It wasn't until later in the night I wanted to watch a movie and my wife wanted to go to bed that I heard how great these can be.  I was using a PS3 to watch Harry Potter and these were AMAZING.  I actually ordered another pair for her so we can watch movies and not have the people below us complain about the sound late at night.  Games are great as well, you can hear people sneak up on you and the bass is suprising enough where you think you should be feeling it but that is nothing a couple of Aura AST-2B-4 Pro Bass Shakers couldnt fix.  In response to some of the reviews where crackling and hissing was heard, I had this when i was around 20' away from the TV take a step or two closer and it goes away.  Once I get to about 30' (the listed range) I have to take them off the background noises are too great.  Considering the distance you sit from your TV this really shouldn't be a concern.  Also at one point I tried moving my router behind the TV this caused crackling and background noises as well, I just moved it back to its original location and was good to go.  If I could change anything, I would like better range just incase I needed to go to the kitchen to get something so I don't have to pause.  Also, I feel that I should warn you, if you have a 3D TV, you have been fairly warned, wear these AND 3D glasses, you will look quite odd lol.
0545123275|3.0|I have mixed feelings for this one. On the positive side, it is a FANTASTIC love story. Absolutely gripping. You can feel the passion radiating from the pages. Hot and steamy. Stiefvater's writing style is wonderful as well. There were parts of the book that were almost poetic the prose was so beautifully written. Unfortunately, those were the only things that gave me goose bumps.<br /><br /> My complaints are rather minor. As I read, I just couldn't refrain from comparing Shiver to the Twilight books. I could go through my list of similarities, but I won't. The one thing that keeps me from saying this book is a must read is the plot itself. There were a good 100 pages or so that had me nodding off. It was so slow. For the romance lovers, those pages contained a lot of relationship building. It was nice to feel the sizzling passion between the characters, but I was hoping for a little more action. I mean, there was a vindictive she-wolf running around causing trouble, but she didn't appear very often. There were times when so much action was missing that the plot felt stagnant.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this book. The storyline was detailed, and I can tell that the remaining books will hold a lot of secrets (like the outcome of the crazy cliffhanger ending). Personally, I want to know what will happen between Sam and Grace.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Amazing footage that will take your breath away. My 5 year old granddaughter asks for it often, it is just as captivating to children as it is to adults. Seeing it in HD makes all the difference in the world.
0385523912|4.0|The praise I have for the author (Barbara Demick) is that more than offering a generalized history and weaving in defector accounts periodically, the book stays very focused on telling the story of a motley cast of characters in the city of Chongjin, with historical milestones in the DPRK woven into their stories. I was personally touched, reading their experiences under the highs and (mostly) lows of the North Korean regime - everything from a teacher discussing the misery of watching malnutritioned students in her class to a doctor who had no medicine to offer her patients, and even love blossoming in such wretched circumstances. The stories cut across classes and offer serious insight into the stark differences in the quality of life for those living in the nation's showcase capital city and those who live outside. This is not a lengthy read but the point gets across on the subject at hand.<br /><br />The downside of this book is that the author is a scholar of North Korea and has not, to my knowledge, ever been inside the DPRK - her research was done in South Korea through secondhand defector accounts. Do I fault her for this? Of course not! However, there are other authors on North Korea who have been able to work their way into getting more access. From those authors, I come to expect the more serious historic chronicles, but I can still appreciate the human face Barbara Demick puts on the average North Korean.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I really love cut the rope. I noticed that there is an update available in the android market for this game but there isn't one available in the amazon market....whats up with that? I was really looking forward to some new levels.
B0052U59F4|3.0|This is a 3.5 star read. The sex scenes were not even bad, but the emotional angst was pushing the boundaries of my emotional threshold.<br /><br />This story was about the conflicting relationship wants and needs of Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey. It was about what Total Trust means to a person. Does it mean Total honesty, total submission, unconditional acceptance? In this novel, I saw two people wrestling with defining the boundaries of the desire based on past issues and what they want for the future. And believe me, it was a battle.<br /><br />The writing of the story was excellent. Obviously, I wouldn't have such a strong reaction if author hadn't drawn me in with her narrative. But the mother in me kept screaming \\"Predator\\" and I wanted to protect Anastasia. Now I know what her roommate, Kate Kavanaugh, was feeling--the Need to Guide Ana as she navigated the path of her own sexuality.<br /><br />It was hard reconciling my definition of love and relationship with the parameters that were set up by Mr. Grey. I agreed with his self-assessment of being \\"Fifty Shades of jacked up\\". He IS emotionally jacked up and his money keeps him self indulgent. While his past gave me insight as to why he was so controlling, it didn't excuse his behavior nor did it make it okay. I felt his roller-coaster mood swings were emotionally abusive. I imagine a timid little girl craving the attention, touch and affection of an emotionally damaged tryant. I found his behavior unnerving, so I can only imagine what it was like for a college senior. I was scared for the inexperienced girl as she was being seduced by a worldly man. However, I was pleased that as the story unfolded, the diffident young lady began finding her voice. And then she used it.<br /><br />But in all fairness, I saw a lot of growth in Christian Grey as well. I am hoping that in Book 2, he will deal with some of his baggage so that he won't let it control him anymore. Maybe I will revisit this review after I have had time to digest this story.
B002RSDW80|2.0|This movie is an unfortunate sign of the times we live in, where publishers and movie producers are more interested in finding a ready-made market for their work than making a work that's worthwhile.  The only reason this got made was because the blogger had established an audience for her work.<br /><br />Really, give this a pass.  No story, no character development, no plot - just like a blog.<br /><br />As much am I'm loathe to criticise Streep, that most talented and giving of actors, her elocution in this irritated me immensely.  I know she gets a hard time for her accents and most of the time I think that's unfair - she is giving, after all, and not self-indulgent - however, when the accent is such a distraction it defeats the purpose.  The voice she adopted in this made me want to not listen any more.

0375842209|4.0|I found myself wearing two hats reading this; that of a writer and that of a reader. Writer-me and reader-me frequently disagreed. What writer me liked, reader me disliked.<br /><br />When I first picked up The Book Thief I felt not a small thrill at the prospect of reading something that promised to be different and I was immediately engaged within a few pages. However, Death as a narrator and his early, frequent interruptions made it very difficult to establish a connection with the characters. In fact, Narrator-Death's glib point of view made it nearly impossible to empathise with the characters. If he didn't care about them, why should I? And if I couldn't care less about the characters, why bother to read the book? Death's interruptions were a miscalculated disruption to the mood the author was trying to establish.<br /><br />Presumably the use of silent movie title cards was intended to demonstrate that to Death all the world's a stage, but again, this misguided device further distanced the reader from the characters.  Death's indifference was unfortunately contagious.<br /><br />Also disruptive was the author's over-use of metaphor and simile, which served no purpose more often than not. Again, these pulled me out of the mood and often caused me to put the book aside (sometimes with a little force.) This was a great shame, because when Zusak got it right, his use of metaphor was absolutely spell-binding: when Papa begins to read, \\"His voice, soft as a cloud,\\" and, \\"The sky was the colour of Jews\\" serve as brilliant and memorable examples of metaphor properly used; employed for a purpose. However, overall there were too many metaphors and similes that served no purpose and greater restraint would have served the author well, as would have resisting the temptation to spell out why the protagonist thieved books. We already got that for ourselves, thanks.<br /><br />What writer-me admired as ambitious, reader-me thought of as pretentious.<br /><br />Zusak's character's were simply wonderful and at times he really has you holding your breath; not necessarily at the most dramatic of times but at the most hopeful. Those times in life that mean the most - not of bombs but of kisses; not of fear but the trembling hope of joy.<br /><br />He is a tremendously talented writer (and so young to have achieved such a book!) but I felt the book suffered a little from these publishing times, when a gimmick or hook is valued above all else. Zusak is far too talented to have need of either.eally has you holding your breath; not necessarily at the most dramatic of times but at the most hopeful.

0374530718|3.0|'Sophie's World' caught me because of the easy to read resume of the world's philosophers. Full marks to the author for this. But the clarity of his resume made it clear that after so many years of philosophy, the outcome is really rather banal. Take the pretentious `Philosopher's Garden Party' towards the end where two fifteen year olds start to kiss at the table. An adult says, `Not at the table, children', and our hero philosopher asks, `Why not?' Justifying himself with, `It's never wrong for a real philosopher to ask questions'. Is that what makes a philosopher `real'? Any fool can ask questions. It doesn't make the philosopher real, just banal. Or take the chapter on the Big Bang, fascinating in its detail, but then we have to put up with this - `we are a spark from the big fire...that's a beautiful thought too'. It's not beautiful. It's banal. And useless. How on earth does it help anyone if we all think of ourselves as `sparks from a fire'. It makes human life and morality meaningless. In fact this whole resume underlines that philosophy is largely useless. In its nearly 450 pages not once do our philosophers seriously address the issue of humans suffering. Instead most of their time is taken up with how we know that we know. They spend time with the question nobody is asking, but ignore the question that pierces most people's lives. Useless. And of course when we get to the 19th and 20th century, the arrogance of the philosophers - especially Nietzsche, Freud, Marx and the followers of Darwin - makes the whole endeavour positively evil, as experienced by the poor Germans and Russians whose leaders ate the philosophers' fare and come up with Nazism and the Soviet Union. Banal, useless, and evil - that's what Sophie's World resume confirms about philosophy.   Compare that to Christ's world. Two billion people find meaning for their lives and morality in His world view, they don't see themselves as `sparks of a fire', but as creatures made in the image of Godput on earth to worship and serve Him. Nothing banal there. Two billion are comforted by His answers to human suffering offered in his death and resurrection. No arm-chair banality there. And wherever his followers have gone, so too have the hospitals, the orphanages, the schools, and `good' works. Nothing evil there. Thank you Justein Gaarder for making clear once again the answer to Tertullian's famous question - `What has Athens to do with Jerusalem?' Nothing.

159102594X|2.0|I have to be honest, this book left me feeling like I wasted both money and time.    First, let me say a couple of good things about the book.  - By the end, I did get hooked and I wanted to know what happened next.  There is enough mystery and intrigue here to set us up nicely for the next book.  - The characters are changeable.  This can be a double-edged sword.  We all seem to want to read about characters who are both non-cliche and consistent.  These characters have a mix of both, which can be good.  Jezal is a pompous ass, but he starts to think about what kind of person he should be and wants to be.  Glokta is a hateful, bitter old bastard, but he constantly wonders why he does what he does, and he's capable of turning around and looking at things in a new light, and yet he remains himself.    For me, that sums up the good qualities.  Unfortunately the book had so many flaws, I have trouble naming all of the ones which bothered me.  - First, the plot: there really isn't one.  There's a lot of intrigue.  There's some action.  Several things... happen.  But by the end of the book, we still don't know what the major problem is.  There's at least one war going on, and a second on the way.  There's some mysterious business that has to do with magic.  But in terms of actual story arc: several characters get thrown together with an ancient wizard and begin a journey to obtain something magical (It has a name, but we don't know what it is or what it does, or why we need it).  Abercrombie simply doesn't spin a tale in this book.  This is more like the first chapter, or at best the first few chapters, of a novel, setting up who the main characters are and what they want to do and where they want to go and then hinting at what the major problem of the story might be, only it's over 500 pages long.    - Next, the characters:  I mentioned before that these characters are changeable.  Unfortunately, they're also not very interesting.  I recognize that this is the most subjective area of this review, but I simply did not find any of them compelling.  I was mildly interested in Logen and somewhat intellectually invested in Glokta's character motivations, but when I read a fantasy story, I want to feel like it is important for me to pay attention to the characters involved, and I just didn't.  Add to that, when the characters did change or face personal challenges, it seemed contrived or forced.  It felt like Abercrombie came by and said, \\"hey, look at this part: see how complex my character is?  He's rethinking his life now - isn't that more realistic and interesting?\\"  Well, it would have been if you weren't pointing it out.    - And then there's the writing style itself.  The author repeatedly uses several phrases that don't work, Fragment sentences thrown in for style, and some really bad bits of grammar.  It seemed like he was trying to be fresh and unique, but it came across as juvenile, ignorant, and distracting.  The most glaring to me was the repeated use of the adjective \\"wet\\" in noun form.  \\"His hair was slick with wet\\"??  Not only is \\"wet\\" not a noun, but more importantly, there is no reason to try and make it one.  There is nothing wrong with the words \\"sweat\\" or \\"water.\\"  If you must use wet, then \\"wetness\\" is already available.  To me this was distracting, as were many other sentence constructions and a few word choices.  If you're anything like me, don't expect to get lost in the prose.  - Finally, the whole story lacked a certain sense of gravitas.  Despite the dark setting and the murderous intrigue, I never felt like any of it was important.  Abercrombie goes out of his way to make his extraordinary characters seem like ordinary people.  I can appreciate that to some degree.  I liked that the legendary \\"First of the Magi\\" could seem like an ordinary butcher.  But with everything happening in a loose string (more like buckshot) of events and no earth-shattering shocks or surprises to grip your attention, there's just nothing here to worry about and very little to engage with.  I prefer to feel like the things that are happening in a novel are important.  So far very little has happened to that effect, and without the characters bearing a bit of that gripping mettle, I just end up not caring.    I'd suggest you feel free to rent this book from the library, if you really have nothing better to read.  And if you put it down and don't feel like picking it back up again, don't sweat it.  It's not worth the late fee.
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|I've watched this movie several times on DVD. but i'm not satisfied, so I bought this blu-ray.<br />I've watched it all over again. I love the story.
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|Can't wait for \\"Walk Me Down the Middle\\" to hit the radio! That is my fave song on the cd : )
B005KJZDXK|5.0|Other than a short stint in my twenties where I didn't want to listen to ANY holiday music, each year I am finding myself turning the dial to the Christmas 24/7 stations after Thanksgiving. At least I was until now. For some reason, this year all of the old classics started to really get on my nerves. The music is so dated.  For $5, I figured I would give this album a download and try to revive my interest in holiday songs. Thankfully, this one delivered. Every time I hop over to the computer for a little background music, I cue up this one and keep it rolling. Haven't had time to burn the songs to a disc for my car, but looking forward to it. Love these! Thanks She & Him for a fresh reboot of the classics.
B004VQFQ2Q|5.0|First of all, this is a pretty good Sabbath album.  Think of it as Sabbath meets Deep Purple.  Not just because Gillan is there, but Iommi uses a guitar tone reminiscent of \\"smoke on the water\\".  Some of Sabbath's heaviest riffs are found here (this and dehumanizer are their heaviest albums imo). Fans will love the second CD, which contains the only authorized life footage with Gillan. Man, this guy really belts it out and smokes Ozzy right out of the water on the classic Sabbath songs.
