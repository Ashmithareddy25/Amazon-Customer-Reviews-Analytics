B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have a rare &amp; serious sleep disorder known as Complex Central Sleep Apnea. As a child I was exposed to the Polio virus and as an adult, this has affected my brain's ability send a signal to my lungs breathe so I am forced to use a ventilator every night, making it difficult for me to fall asleep. I have this app installed on my ipod,  and I can say with all honesty that I have probably tried every app of this type currently on the market,  and this one is the best for me. I set it up with a gentle breeze with windchimes lightly ringing, bird's singing in the background, and a sprinkler gently creating a variable white noise, and when I close my eyes, it's like I'm transported back to my backyard porch as a child while taking a nap. It has helped me a great deal,  and I highly recommend this app as a sleeping aide or just to relax with. Very effective.
B0086700CM|5.0|I was soooooooo excited when they finally put on the kf app store!!!!! I don't know why it doesn't have 5 full stars! I mean its FREE!!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a fast read as I couldn't put it down.  I can't wait to read more from this author.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|I LIKE A GOOD HIDDEN OBJECT GAME THAT HAS T OTHER THINGS GOING ON IN THE GAME.I ALSO LIKE THE DETAIL OF THE AREAS. I HOPE AS I GO ALONG IN THE GAME IT ONLY GETS BETTER.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun easy app my kids and I enjoy together.<br />Pretty straight forward as far as a solitaire app goes.<br />Especially like all the settings you can adjust.<br />'
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Fun game.  Wish energy renewed faster.  Like the different challenges you have to accomplish. over all a fun way to spend time.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Pretty darn good program. I like that I can save areas that I travel to frequently and am able to jump back and forth between the locations so easily. Very simple and easy program yo use.
B007549W62|1.0|One star for the pleasant and mood-appropriate music throughout the movie. The plot (group of people trapped in confined space) has been done over and over in different settings, nothing new there. There are plenty of post-apocalyptic movies out there that are much, much better.<br /><br />Honestly, you would think scriptwriters could learn how to use the internet, since it is fairly obvious they have no practical education in using a library. I have a number of problems with this film, most having to do with filmmakers completely ignoring anything resembling reality. (You can go to ready.gov to read about nuclear blast emergencies, and what to do in case of one)<br /><br />***********Spoilers**************<br /><br />1. If you were that close to the blast they watch, it's game over. The flash travels at the speed of light, the following blast wave travels at the speed of sound (approximately 768 mph). At the very least, they would have been blind. Yet, they make it to the basement with no ill effects. They never show a blast wave. Quite some time later the building falls without crashing through the basement.<br /><br />2. They are fairly close to the blast. Accute radiation sickness kills in under 48 hours, depends on your level of exposure. They only show some signs of radiation sickness (bleeding gums and hair loss), what you would expect from someone a distance away from the blast site. They never show signs of nausea, they eat and eat and eat all through the movie. They never get infections, even the guy who gets shot. Based on the symptoms they DO show, 50% of them should have been dead within 4-6 weeks.<br /><br />3. EMP. Ok, lets say their electrical equipment survives. Where, exactly, is the electricity they are using coming from?<br /><br />4. They are worried about fallout but never close off the ventilation system. DUH<br /><br />5. The people that come in and steal the little girl make no sense. When the guy goes out there, he does so to no purpose. They are then sealed in by the people outside. Completely pointless. If someone kidnaps a kid, shoot first, ask later.<br /><br />6. At the end, why is the concrete building burning? Gasoline explodes, it is not a slow burn. You cannot use gasoline in a lamp. BTW, concrete DOES NOT BURN. That basement survived a nuclear blast, but went up like a dry wood building from less than a pop bottle of fuel in a lamp. Get real.<br /><br />As for the characters in the movie, no one ever shows the least bit of \\"good\\" humanity, it is all about how people are selfish and weak, cowardly and cruel. Which is true to some extent, but I find it hard to believe out of a group of people, NONE would have any redeeming qualities AT ALL. (Or go nuts and try to kill everyone.) Even the one \\"good\\" character is just like the rest in the end.

B0063GORYU|3.0|Great game for keeping you busy some where without wifi. A little more complex than regular solitaire. Buy this game.
B008MEM24S|5.0|wish the new levels would come! fun game for my kids and me! Disney did a great job with this one. well worth the price.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it should be on every ipod oped and any other market place best game you and your friends will love it
B008MEM24S|5.0|It starts easy and gets hard. I like that. Its just like wheres my water but a take on a Disney show my little brother likes to watch. Plenty of fun and a lot of levels. And if its like Where's my water it'll have level updates. And so far there have been no forcee closes or errors. Nicely done.
0345803493|1.0|The book must have came with a turd as a bookmark because there is crap all over the pages. I honestly felt my intelligence was being insulted the more I read. I don't think the author needs an editing team. I think she needs either:<br />1- an award for duping the public into both believing the repetitiveness and novice shock value such a great read the author will never have to work again ever<br />Or<br />2- a mental retardation exam<br /><br />Anyone rating this \\"book\\" as 5 stars.... please, for the love of all that is holy, do get out more.<br /><br />I seemed to be reading the same thing infinite times over again that skipping 5-8 pages at a time didn't mean missing any of the story line and I use the term \\"story line\\" loosely.<br /><br />I can't even think of words to describe my horror when I hear someone say \\"la de da this book is the best ever.\\" Really? Compared to what? Writing on the men's room stalls?<br /><br />At least one good thing comes from my time reading this garbage. I know what will pass as a novel whereby I can make millions of dollars and kiss my student loan debt goodbye.
B000A2W1X2|5.0|I love this movie - Sophie Marceau strikes true notes throughout the movie, showing us both vulnerability and strength, in turn. And Stephen Dillane (so good in the HBO-produced \\"John Adams\\" mini-series) is near-perfect as the man who falls in love with her...and tries desperately to forget her after she bears his child (a paid arrangement - she receives money, most desperately needed, in exchange for their baby). Without giving away any plot-points, there are many obstacles in their path of happiness and shared devotion to their child, and both of them are tested in severe measure. I cannot recommend this movie enough, for those 'box o' tissues and semi-sweet romantic movie required' evenings...
B005JABU82|5.0|This was my first snap together kit and I didn't know what to expect. If you want to know what to expect you can see what's in the box in this video: [...]. The instructions are in Japanese but the diagrams are easy to follow and you will find a translation to English online if you need. I am very happy with the quality and detail of this kit: the pieces fit together accurately and securely. The joints offer incredible range of motion and it's cool to see the armor plates slide apart to allow for the motion. This took me about 2 days of work at a leisurely pace. I will be buying more of these kits soon.

B006LSZECO|2.0|A happy couple marries, but sometimes these things don't last.  Having been laid off from their jobs in New York City, and low on rent income, they move into a tract home the husband's parents own in his hometown in Missouri.  His sister, with whom he has always been close, has preceded them for the same reason.  He borrows money from her to open a bar.  The the wife and the sister have little in common, so the husband's spending time running the bar doesn't work for the wife, leaving her to find fault with him and their boring life.<br /><br />At this point the story moves to the ridiculous.  The couple takes sniping at one another to a whole new level. They devote all their time plotting hateful things to do to one another.  At first, his twin sister takes her brother's side, but she comes to see that her brother is just as mean as his wife.<br /><br />Finally the wife takes off, hoping to set up her husband for a possible murder charge since the whole town knew about their fights.  The husband alerts the media and repeatedly begs for her return.  Wary, but running out money, the wife returns.  When she does, what happens is as unpredictable as they are.
B0086700CM|5.0|i love this game......<br />best game ever!  it is soo fun!!!! I would definitely recommend getting this app!!! Good job imangi studios!!!!
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|Part l is a very detailed story about brother and sister twins who live with their delusional parents in Great Falls, Montana, near the Canadian border.  After lengthy discussions of the parents' backgrounds, they rob a bank.  The changing plans for the robbery are overdone to the point of making one skip ahead.<br /><br />Part 2 is much more interesting about what happens to the son after their parents are put in prison. According to his mother's wishes, a friend of hers finds Dill living on his own and drives him over the border to a small town where her (fugitive) brother manages a hotel.  Dill is in overwhelming trouble, but he's a smart boy who has learned well how to listen and watch people in order to survive. This part is a thriller.<br /><br />Part 3 Traditional storytelling.  Dill ends up being a good man, a good husband and father.
B00846REIS|4.0|Rates up there with E.L. James...a page-turner that is hot and steamy, well worth reading, especially if you enjoyed Fifty Shades of Grey.  I can't wait to read the next installment!
030788743X|5.0|I loved every minute I spent reading this book. There's nothing I can say that hasn't been said in the reviews already. The narrative is fast and suspenseful, and you fall in love with many of the characters in the story.<br /><br />It really was something I wish never ended. The last time I felt so astonished by a book was when I read Ender's Game for the first time. The cornucopia of pure geekiness and the veritable trivia brings in a sense of nostalgia and even though I was born during the late 80s, I have watched or read many of the works referenced int he novel.<br /><br />Definitely going to keep my eye on Ernest Cline in the future.
B007SGM084|5.0|I haven't read a \\"romance\\" novel since I was in my teens....so needless to say, I'm not one to read these types of books.  I tend to read more of James Patterson...some Nora Roberts....you get the picture.  Pretty tame in comparison to what E.L. James dishes up in these novels.  But I tell ya, I really enjoyed these books.  Not only were they hot and steamy but they left me wanting to know more about what happened with the characters.  For a quick read that will leave you breathless and wanting...teeheehee, read these books!!!
1439192812|5.0|A great book about what is real and what is imaginative. For those who don't know the difference read this book three times and click your heals...
0143119680|2.0|I read this book 3 months ago, and am now reading book 2. (So far, book 2 is pretty boring.)<br /><br />On to the review of A Discovery of Witches<br /><br />The first half of ADOW was tedious. Too much time spent explaining historical manuscripts and elaborating on food, wine, and clothing (black stretchy pants). This pedantic prose was exacerbated by the fact that I listened to the audio version and could not  skip ahead. The audio reader had a fine voice, nothing that distracted or annoyed, but the content was one big yawn much of the time.<br /><br />The story included some violence, one torture scene, and some relationship development. No love scenes, but some foreplay and suggested oral sex. Matthew called Diana his lion, in French, repeatedly. Repeatedly!!  (yet she was not so much a lion as a wet noodle).<br /><br />The characters were not so appealing. Diana the witch was helpless, obedient, whiny and dithering. She did not act like a 33 year-old with a Ph.D. She did not reflect the powerful ancestry that was hers, nor the upbringing with her aunt, a witch of strong character. I did not grow to love her.<br /><br />And Matthew the vampire did yoga and liked wine.  A lot of talk of yoga and wine. Matthew's character was bland, in my view.<br /><br />On the up side, the author inspired in me a desire to visit Oxford to explore the Bodleian Library.<br /><br />And even better, the pace picked up, FINALLY,  at around disk 14 (of 20). I cringed during the attack by the evil Satu, was charmed by the fascinating living witch-house and the adorable grandma ghost, and horrified by the attack of the jealous witch, Juliet. I liked getting to know Emma (Em) and Hamish and the daemon's pregnant wife, as secondary characters. Hope we see more of them.<br /><br />Despite the parts I did enjoy, I could not rate this more than 2 stars, based on the first 13 disks. If the book were shorter, or the pacing tighter, I could go with 3 or 4 stars.<br /><br />Another problem: Inconsistent character development. For example, given Matthew's strong alliance with the church from early childhood, the religious swear words seemed out of character. According to the story, Matthew prizes crucifixes, participated in the Crusades, was allied to the church and to the Knights Templar and/or Masons ( I forget) in his pre-vampire days, and generally was a devout Christian. So the profanity seemed jarring, given the context.  Further, it reflects a disregard for the diversity of readers, some of whom were brought up to avoid such language.<br /><br />For another example, given Diana's abilities, education, and heritage, she should not have been so bland, so boring, so obedient. Sometimes she seemed like wonder woman, but mostly not. What did I like? Seeing her develop her witchcraft.<br /><br />One more thing. The author seemed unclear of her genre. At times, it felt like I was reading historical fiction, due to all the info- dumps about old manuscripts and ancient societies,  but the book is classified as romance. I have nothing against historical fiction, and have read and loved McCullough's 1775, Sobel's Longitude, Shaara's Killer Angels, Cohen's Hinges of History series, etc.  Those authors know how to write captivating historical narrative! After romance, my next favorite genre is historical narrative.<br /><br />A few weeks ago, I heard Harkness speak at a local book store in the San Francisco area.  In the Q and A session, someone asked her what she had read of the paranormal genre, before embarking on her series. She said the only book with vampires she had read was by Ann Rice, and that she read it 20 years ago. In my view, this author needs to get a clue about this genre and the readership she is hoping to capture.nsistent character development.

0345803485|1.0|This book is exasperatingly...DUMB! There is zero character development, and what we do know about the title characters makes them both annoying and utterly unsympathetic...but what most annoys me about the book is the severe overuse of the words \\" Crap\\", \\"Holy Crap\\", \\"Double Crap\\", \\"oh my!\\" and of course, \\"mercurial\\" and \\"heady\\"!! Uhhhh...if you're looking for Erotica, try some Anais Nin or Henry Miller!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|The book is really great, it covers all the aspects with the basics, nutrition, routines and suplements, also has very good references like university studies, the book worth every dollar.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|awesomest game ever or best zombie game ever but the game is a challenge good free game too so over all its a great game
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Addicting -- the kids beat the levels before I can even play the game! Wish there was a way to set up the game so that multiple players could play using the same device and taking turns.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|I would rate this 5 stars, but I don't think everyone will like this as much as it is worthy. The comparison to band of brothers is unavoidable, but probably not the best way to judge this. Band of brothers was amazing. I was a huge fan of that series. The thing about band of brothers is it is a war movie in the fact that you watch it and think wow what an experience. Even with all the death and suffering in Band of Brothers I wonder how many young kids watch it and want to enlist or wish they could have fought the Nazis is WWII. The pacific does not glorify the war. It gives a brutally honest portrayal of the hell these soldiers went through. It makes us all appreciate what those men did for their country in its time of need. If band of brothers left you're teenager wanting to join up and explore the world make him or her watch the pacific to get the full picture. War is hell.
B00701L5XS|5.0|Great app. pics / demos of the knots are clear. using right now to rig some hooks and lures for a fishing trip this afternoon
B0086700CM|5.0|Be prepared to spend a lot of time on this one. This game dominates every phone and tablet in our household of four.
B00067BBSC|1.0|Not sure who wrote the reviews on this dvd & cd collection but this stuff is junk. Cd sounds like crap in my cd player in my cars and the dvd is junk in my dvd player with bose surround sound. Ended up going back to download studio mp3's of the few tracks I enjoy. DON'T WASTE YOU'RE MONEY ON THIS SET. High end equipment will not make up for the poor job they did on this set.
B0064Y5U24|5.0|If you liked Dark Horse, you will love this Nickelback album!  I have been a Nickelback fan since 2000.  It seems like every album gets better than the last one!  Here and Now is another great album that you can play non-stop!  How many other albums can do that??  Really great mainstream rock!!  Bottoms Up is a great rock song, and Holding On To Heaven is a great slower, romantic song!  Keep on rocking Nickelback!!!!
B00466HM28|5.0|I had first bought a JamminPro PK25 Midi controller. I had no problem with that, although I must say the keys were a little sticky. However I found the Akai MPK Mini having more features with just about $10 more. So I returned the JamminPro and bought this. I had read reviews about the pads not being sensitive, but I am facing no problem. However, I must admit that these pads are the first ones that I'm setting my fingers on. Great product for the price!
B004LWZW6K|1.0|Absolutely terrible!!!  The acting was so bad.  More for teenager getting their first glimpse of breast.  Plenty of fake breast and sex scenes but other than that it's made for ignorant folks.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game allows players to create their own community and take care of their creatures by feeding them and helping them build families.  The Ice Age characters are funny as always.
B007PEIHKE|1.0|I had two of these units.  One became very hot after two days of use and the other killed my Netgear switch.  In fact in one case I had tried the unit on another switch and as soon as the device would be connected to the switch it would disable all communications.  In twenty fives years of working with network switches I have never seen any device disabling a switch.<br /><br />Not sure how this manufacturer is in business selling these cheap devices - made in C****.
B005DZMP00|5.0|I got this in the mail about three weeks ago. It hasn't strayed far from my Cd player since. An awesome selection oof songs that fits nicely with the original Europe 72.<br /> The \\"Playing in the band\\" that closes out the set is the icing on the already really sweet cake. My favorite era of the Dead. If you're a newbie or an old time head this is the set to get. After Europe. 72 of course. Happy listening.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Before I bought the 5th book I read most of the Amazon reviews and was a bit concerned I would not like the fifth book. How wrong I was!  I thought it was just as good as the other books, and has done a great job further developing the complex characters. No one character is spared from the duality of right and wrong, from good choices and bad, and from the pains that war and separation inflict. I can't wait for the sixth book: George Martin - please publish soon!
B004SBQGHS|1.0|Are you kidding me?? this last update reset my ENTIRE game! I had three stars in every level except the new ones and after this update it wiped out all of it!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I read a few chapters and put it down. I have been reading other books.  I have not finished it yet so 2 stars so far.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I am SO enjoying these old movies in Blue Ray!! Hurray! Am working my way thru them, and is a tremendous treat to see them as they should have been. Hump-backed whales. Klingon ships. Love them! Great deal, great product! Wish there were more \\"extras\\" on the DVD's, like blurbs, out-takes, etc. Commentaries bore me.
B000006NPY|5.0|This is still prime Pumpkins before they would totally change their make up and direction. The lyrics are stunning and quite poetical, showing more growth and development than any of their other albums. It sits right beside MCIS in that sense.<br /><br />This quite honestly was near the apex of their career. Some of their best theater concerts we being played at this time. Different and less melodic or poppy than their past masterpieces but never weak in any way besides being a tad overcompressed in sound levels. Machina and the later works simply do not quite compare. Their--I mean his--newer stuff is not even in the same league. If I were to point out one thing it is the lyrics. Billy's lyrical output is not even on the same planet as it used to be. Where the song titles to Oceania and such are intriguing the lyrics are pretty much not near as polished or thoughtful and even border on too sanguine and sloppy in many places. I am grateful they had this last one in them before things got difficult.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|george martin's attention to detail is exceptional. he creates such a vivid world for the reader to imagine. this book is a must read for any fantasy fan.
B004TRKH9O|5.0|There are four different main CD versions of this release. The first release in the 80s on Jive, along with a couple others in different countries, the first remastered 1996 version, the 2000 era Castle release with just the album and brickwalled sound on 3 tracks, and the newer Esoteric release with full dynamic range and a second disc of extras.<br /><br />Sound Quality is all up to your ears. The original which is a little crusty, although some people seem to like its sound from the old 80s ADC convertors, the 90s version which sounds fine, the early 2000 version which sounds fine but has a quite low DR on some tracks, and the two disc Esoteric to my ears sounds great and a bit more lively on the top end.<br /><br />Altogether I think the new Esoteric releases are mandatory for TD fans because of the stellar packaging. Some have said there is a bit of noise reduction, but I am not really hearing it to any harsh degree. New analog to digital convertors I am sure pick up tons of noise, and at any rate the sound is fantastic to my ears.<br /><br />I honestly cannot hear all that much difference on any of the remasters. I find the EQ just fine for the most part. The album still has a lot of noise on this 2011 release. One poster on Hoffman forums, who I find in every thread about Esoteric TD remasters, seems to think falsely that they have worse dynamic range. This is the opposite case for Zeit. All tracks actually have the full dynamic range here. I don't hear but a pinch of noise reduction and quite honestly these records need a bit of it.<br /><br />The cover art for the Castle Remaster and 2CD Esoteric are slightly different in color and tone. Overall, I find the Esoteric release to be totally satisfying. These old TD records can have too much hiss if you ask me, and they are still plenty noisy even with this new remaster. I for one am listening on quality hardware, and I find it hard to distinguish between the two at times.<br /><br />You really don't need to know much about this one for the actual content. It is one of TD's utter masterpieces. Innovative and enthralling to the end. &#34;Birth of Liquid Plejades&#34; may be the single greatest ambient/electronic track in history. Eerie and so encompassing in high-end headphones. Smoke up for this one and turn the lights off. There is nothing else quite like it.<br /><br />The rest of the CD is highly experimental and still of very high quality. The extra disc on the Esoteric presents two long alternate tracks from the era and a different spin on TD's abilities. Well worth the price for the stellar extras on this one. Zeit is well worth your money.ow much about this one for the actual content. It is one of TD's utter masterpieces.

B006ZCWU5K|5.0|Bruce nails it again in Wrecking Ball, a truly moving and wonderful album.  Taking aim at the economic elites of the world he calls into question the American business culture and how it gets in the way of the American Dream.  \\"Wrecking Ball\\", \\"Shackled and Drawn\\" and \\"Death to my Hometown\\" are spectacular take downs of the economic paradigm we endure.  As with the Rising he does get intimate with his songs and makes the subjects real for the listener. \\"Easy Money\\" is a threatening song with a desperate undertone, yet is catchy and funny at the same time.<br /><br />This is a great album lyrically and musically quite satisfying.  It has country and folk music woven throughout which gives it a Peter Seeger feel.  However it is genuine Bruce and his authentic love for the common man.
B008N1V11U|5.0|its cool you can play the movie and fight bane and you can destroy and and ride them. you go into the batcave and practies.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really wasn't sure what to expect after the first few pages, but I was immediately intrigued. The book was a definite page-turner, and I was surprised throughout. The characters are well developed, the story is engrossing and it's not one of those mysteries you solve halfway through. I didn't really like any of the characters but still couldn't wait to see what their next moves. I'm just waiting to hear this will be made into a movie. Buy this book!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this app, and it's free!! It can provide many hours of enjoyment for puzzle lovers, and the scenes are beautiful!! There are so many to choose from, and if you opt for one of the paid additions, they are inexpensive. The number of puzzle pieces can be changed, so difficulty level can go from easy to more difficult for a greater challenge. There is even opional background piano music, too, which I love. I haven't experienced any of the problems mentioned by some of the other reviewers, including bothersome ads. It seems that if ads are a problem, you would just need to turn off wi-fi. Once the app is downloaded, you don't need a wi-fi connection. Overall, a great job by the developers, I think....thanks!
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I really enjoyed this one! It was a little Harry Potter + Outlander + Twilight with a grownup feel. Nothing super surprising, but I would rank it above just a \\"beach read.\\" I have already purchased book two and can't wait to see what happens next. Definite buy.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|it is really awesome and fun u can play it on anything and u would really love it like I love it!!!!
B0087DFIYA|4.0|In his personal life, Mel Gibson appears to be a complete mess and perhaps even mentally ill.  On screen, however, the man can still flat-out make a movie.  \\"Get the Gringo\\" wasn't released in U.S. theaters - althought it got a theatrical release everywhere else - reflecting his public perception slide here at home, but if you're a fan of his onscreen work, be sure to check this out.  It's a gritty modern noire with enough of the traditional Gibson levity to keep it from getting too dark - think \\"Payback\\" south of the border - and a great way to blow an hour and a half.

B001CC7PP8|5.0|Stephen Rebello's commentary is very informative but I am a little concerned at his nature of not backing up his conclusions with sources. There is an obvious mistake in it that further raises that concern. He states the doors used in the Victorian mansion were from the San Francisco Crocker Mansion. The Crocker mansion on Nob Hill was completely burned down in the 1906 earthquake, so that is obviously wrong. I am a historian of San Francisco Victorians and happen to own the doors used as props on the set that was built indoors and included the front porch and the interior room from the Psycho set. They were sold at auction by Butterfield's about 20 years ago and came with prop tags saying hold for Psycho IV. I have an acquaintance who owns the bedroom set from the mother's room. All of these props came from the 1872 Italianate Victorian mansion of California Senator Milton Latham call Linden Towers which was located in what is now called Menlo Park, just south of San Francisco on the peninsula. The house and furnishings cost $750,000 in 1872, not counting the 300 acres it sat on. The interiors were done by Herter Brothers of NYC. It was torn down during WWII when you could not buy lumber for sets due to rationing. Some of the big Hollywood studios bought most of the over-sized furniture (the house had 17 foot ceilings) and even the gasoliers, doors, and lumber at auction. These items were used in countless famous classic movies from that day forward. Warner Brothers also finally sold their cache of props from this house at auction about 3 years ago for huge sums of money.

B000FC2L1Y|4.0|I have absolutely devoured the past three novels of the Outlander series, but this next chapter was extremely hard to get through. There were some great moments, and it sometimes made me laugh. But, unlike the other three, this was extremely slow. It almost felt like a filler, with its only purpose to set you up for the next one. I am happy I read it, because I love Jamie and Claire and their story. This one was just missing the spark of the first three, and I was disappointed. I hope the next books regain the beauty that Drums of Autumn lost.

B006GHA9VQ|5.0|I have become aware recently that there is a well organized group of POTO fanatics who have made it their mission to sabotage LND and have been active since the play first opened in London. Apparently they feel it is sacriligious to touch Phantom in any way. Thank heaven there was no such group of fanatics of the book or we may never have seen ALW's Phantom because he certainly took many liberties with the book and in my mind if he decides to extend his Phantom, then why not? It's his to work with. I first saw a snippet of LND on PBS and became so intrigued I bought the DVD sight unseen -- I have not regretted it. If you are a fan of musical theater, you must see this, it is fantastic. There has been much written about the weak story line and I admit it is very soap operaish, but, look at Phantom. I mean, really, how plausible is it that a man could live under the opera house, menacing and threatening the opera company AND killing people and nobody does anything about it? Forget the weak story, what makes LND (and POTO) great is the music. ALW has written a marvelous score that leaves you humming and wanting to hear more. The DVD of the Australian production is beautifully filmed and the sound, at least on the blu-ray is impeccable. Everyone involved in this production has done a wonderful job from the director down to the set and costume designer, the music director, and the cast. So, please, if you are unsure, rent the dvd, but please don't let the nay sayers influence you -- judge it for yourself.

0316056863|4.0|As i continued getting into the \\"Meat\\" of this book I wondered if Tina was telling these stories as truth.  Or was she making them up? Or did they really happen and she was telling them with a very off beat, whacky, bawdy sense of humor?  Now that I have finished the book, I still don't know.  Maybe I am sexist, but it confuses me that a woman who is so beautiful and talented can write a book that, if true, sometimes shows her in a rather dark light.  Don't get me wrong.  It was a fun book to read, but I am still confused.  Is Tina Fey serious?  Did these things she describes in this book really happen?<br /><br />Give the \\"Bossypants\\" a shot, but don't think that it will leave you with a great feeling.  It just makes you wonder.  Is she serious?  What a total whack job.

B006LSZECO|4.0|This novel is full of twisty turns. I was halfway through the book when all of a sudden I had a huge ah-ha! moment. The writing was really good, and the story was clever. I won't be recommending it to my friends because the ending left me with a sick feeling in my stomach, but I am glad I read it nonetheless.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wow... this book is simply a MUST READ. From start to finish, i was always attached to the book; it was just so alluring and made you want to read more! The story of Hazel Grace Lancaster and her journey with Augustus Waters is simply just beautiful. I like how this book just makes you think - like REALLY think about life, death, love, and our place in this world. Not gonna lie, it made me bawl like a baby. It gives you a new perspective on life and your loved ones.<br />I would certainly say that everybody - above the age of 13 - should read this book.
B007UQ5Z1G|4.0|I have all 5 Linkin Park albums. I am happy that their musical style has changed through the years, because I would not want 5 albums that sound the same. This album seems to be a compromise, about half of it sounding like \\"Hybrid Theory\\" and \\"Meteora\\", and the other half having the evolved sound of \\"Minutes To Midnight\\" and \\"A Thousand Suns\\". Of the ballads, \\"Burn It Down\\" is probably the best. \\"Roads Untraveled\\" is a little tame, although very pretty. \\"Until It Breaks\\" is a more complex song in the mold of the ones on \\"A Thousand Suns\\". Of the louder rock tracks, the best are \\"Lost In The Echo\\", \\"Lies Greed Misery\\" and \\"Victimized\\". There are 2 tracks that stand out because they don't quite fit into any category: \\"Castle Of Glass\\" and \\"Skin To Bone\\". I think that all this variety was an attempt to please as many of their fans as they could. This resulted in a good album but one which lacks the impact of an album like \\"A Thousand Suns\\", which was a unified concept album and deviated from the mainstream about as far as a pop/rock album could go. Still, the music is excellent, there is lots of emotion, and the vocals are as good as ever, so I would call \\"Living Things\\" another successful album.
B001Q7JD5O|5.0|This review is for the King Kong (Extended Version) (Amazon Instant Video)<br /><br />It's be a while since I saw this in the theater, but remember really liking it, so I purchased this for home streaming and decided to get the extended version.  I love it.  As the story unfolds you get lots and lots of edge of your seat scenes, with lots of tension and gripping action.<br /><br />I don't think the that the scenes between Ann Darrow and Kong are too much or too many, in fact they help the story to unfold and provide some charming relief, comic at times, to the action, which is much needed.<br /><br />Peter Jackson and crew has created a lush and beautiful world, be it Skull Island or 1930's New York.  It's a world you can immerse yourself in and enjoy as the tragic tale of Kong is told.<br /><br />The cast also did an outstanding job, which I didn't think the first time I saw this.  After seeing it again, I've changed my mind and think the cast played out their parts perfectly.<br /><br />I'd recommend the extended version for folks who get pulled into this type of movie, so that they can sit back and get lost in the world of Kong.

0316017930|5.0|It took me a long time to pick up a copy of Outliers to read. I had read many of the print media reviews when the book came out and most, unfortunately, focused on the role of birth month on one's \\"success.\\" I thought I knew the whole story - as many books have a single theme - and pushed it off. But its popularity kept nagging at me, so I ordered a copy this year and found to my pleasant surprise that this is a book with many more insights on life and success. It is brilliant and a must read for all.<br /><br />Best selling author Malcolm Gladwell in \\"Outliers\\" shows how each of us a product of history and community, of opportunity and legacy...not just our birth month. \\"Success is not exceptional or mysterious. It is grounded in a web of advantages and inheritances, some deserved, some not, some earned, some just plain lucky - but all critical to making them who they are. The outlier, in the end, is not an outlier at all.\\"<br /><br />Opportunity comes in many forms to all - for some it is their birth month, others their birth year. It comes in the form of discrimination (color, age, ethnicity), pioneers who preceded us and changed circumstances, discipline & a focused work effort, personal sacrifice and the sacrifices of others, and in the case of Bill Gates, a woman's club buying a computer. Good \\"luck\\" and bad \\"luck\\" are spread evenly. Opportunity is determined by how we respond.

1451648537|5.0|An excerpt from my blog on blogspot (laurilandwriter):<br /><br />\\".....the book popped up on every book review from pop culture magazines to the Times.  It sounded interesting but who has the time to dig into a book that's heavier than my first-born child when there are so many shades of gray to keep me occupied?  I wish I could convey the depth of sarcasm intended at the end of THAT sentence.  But thanks to a brainy friend in my book group, Steve Jobs found his way to my nightstand.  Although I always keep up my end of the deal on the wine-drinking at book group, I had recently been slacking on the book-reading portion, so I really had to hunker down before the girls voted me out......<br /><br />If you've been alive over the past 30 years, you know the basics of the story.  Bright but socially-stunted computer guys start a company in the garage and build it into a bazillion-dollar industry.  There are a ton of details about the technology and the ups-and-downs of the business that are absorbing if you like that sort of thing (did I mention that I'm a nerdgirl?).  But the best part is that Mr. Isaacson, while obviously a Jobs fan, is searingly honest about the man.  Others have been described as 'visionaries,' but few others in recent history deserve that title to the extent that Jobs does.\\"

B0087YYHZU|5.0|This is a revisit to a movie I haven't seen in years.  Have I changed my view?  Nope.  In fact, watching the film on the new Blu ray disc more than confirms that the film still holds up after 60 years.  The video transfer maintains the original 1.37:1 aspect ratio. While the images aren't quite as natural as you might like, there are very few distractions.  The colors are spectacular and the dancing is the greatest ever put on film.<br /><br />Gene Kelly seen here in his prime and in a tuxedo, could have been a great James Bond.  Cool, good looking with beautiful women all around.  Dancing never had a better stud.  Donald O'Connor is a second banana here, but check him out in his solo routine, \\"Make `Em Laugh\\".  He teams up with Kelly in a couple complicated numbers and you will never see better choreography.<br /><br />The story centers around the time when silent films made the transition to \\"talkies\\" (1927) and Kelly's leading lady couldn't make the jump due to her high pitched Brooklyneze voice.  Her voice and singing are later dubbed in by a newcomer named Kathy (Debbie Reynolds).  She's also Don's (Kelly) new fling.  This is all fun, inside stuff but the real action is on the dance floor.<br /><br />The film of course, features Kelly's take on the title song, which I've seen dozens of times.  It is still spectacular.  I had forgotten about the 13 minute dance sequence in the last act featuring Kelly and long-legged Cyd Charisse.  She dances throughout this number with a 30 foot long scarf flowing behind her.  It wraps gracefully around Kelly several times.  It is beautiful to watch, as is the whole movie.<br /><br />While the film in this Blu ray version is visually an upgrade from DVD, the audio is the real star.  The newest option is a lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  It's a big deal.  The songs in particular have been given a wonderful mix.  The LFE channel is restrained keeping focus suggested by the original mono score.  Special features include a new documentary, commentary by several of the stars and others and a \\"jump-to-song\\" feature.  This is a pretty bare bones package (one disc) for what is a milestone film.new documentary, commentary by several of the stars and others and a \\"jump-to-song\\" feature.

B0041KKYBA|5.0|\\"Inside Job\\" is a good and clear explanation of what's wrong with the financial and political system that we have today.  There is nothing new in this documentary, but it does a good job of summarizing and connecting what we know.  Unfortunately, it offers little in terms of concrete suggestions on how to best proceed.  Yes, we know that Washington is beholden to Wall Street, and that it's essentially a revolving door between the two.  We know that the academics and the experts and the rating agencies who are supposed to monitor Wall Street is actually in Wall Street's pay.  We know these things, and so what?  We got rid of George Bush, and now we have Barack Obama who's reneged on his promise to change, and is doing as great a job for Wall Street as presidents Reagan, Bush I, Clinton, and Bush II.<br /><br />There's something wrong with the system, and the worst thing is no one seems to know what to do about it.
B005LAII3U|3.0|I almost went back to take another look at the 1990's version, but I'm glad I didn't.  There are a couple things that are big distinctions between the two.  First, this new iteration eschews the going to Mars thing and relies more on the Phillip K. Dick short story, \\"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale.\\"  Second, the main character of Douglas Quaid is played by a real actor (Colin Farrell) vs. the original played by body builder/investor/politician Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Without getting into too many comparisons between the two films, certainly the Arnold version had wit along with the campy feel.  This new version lacks both and to some extent, to its detriment.<br /><br />In this dystopian world of the late 21st century, Earth is left with 2 inhabitable civilizations.  Based on a map briefly displayed in the film the world's one-percenters live in an area known as the United Federation of Britain comprised of the U. K. and parts of northern Europe.  Everyone else lives in the Colony (the former Australia).  One of the nice things about the movie is the visualization of this world, straight out of Ridley Scott's masterpiece \\"Blade Runner\\" which of course was also written by Dick.  It is here where much of the action takes place.  And action there is.<br /><br />Quaid is a worker on an assembly line making robots at the UFB and commutes daily via The Fall which appears to be a giant subway that gets from the Colony to UFB in a matter of minutes by short cutting through the middle of the planet.  Cool.  Midway on this ride, the transport does some kind of back-flip which causes a zero gravity state.  That comes into play late in the film.  Also cool.  Quaid's wife is played by everyone's favorite-in-black-leather, Kate Beckinsale (also director Len Wiseman's wife).  She stays around much longer than poor Sharon Stone did with Arnie in the original.<br /><br />Out of boredom, Quaid decides to take a shot at a mind altering memory process called Rekall (not a typo).  This interupted experiment brings him to a conscious state where he now has the fighting ability of a trained military agent.  He also now is being hunted by the bad guys headed by Cohaagen (Bryan Cranston), the head of UFB.  Cohaagen is close to unleashing an army of robotic soldiers to cleanse the Colony of the unwashed.  Quaid is assisted by Melina (Jessica Biel), his one time lover.  Unfortunately he doesn't remember her.  Melina and Kate get it on, uh...fighting scenes, a couple times which is... meh.<br /><br />In addition to the lack of humor, \\"Total Recall\\" (2012) also lacks the chemistry between the characters to give it much depth.  In the aforementioned \\"Blade Runner,\\" the main characters are given time to connect and build an understanding even between enemies.  Here, there is no attempt.  Instead that time is given to 2 or 3 excellent, if too long, chase sequences.  In short this is a visually excellent sci-fi thriller with plenty of cool toys (love the built-in hand phone) and lots of action.  And if you're wondering about the 3-breasted prostitute in the original, she shows up here too with a fleeting peek-a-boob in keeping with the PG-13 rating.This interupted experiment brings him to a conscious state where he now has the fighting ability of a trained military agent.

B006ZZANG0|4.0|After the wrist-cutting music that was \\"All Days are Nights: Song for Lulu\\" Rufus Wainwright returns to upbeat and lush instrumentation for his seventh studio album. The opening track \\"Out of the Game\\" is by far the highlight of the album (also check out its video which features Helena Bonham Carter) sets the tone the album. \\"Jericho\\", \\"Welcome to the Ball\\", \\"Bitter Tears\\", \\"Perfect Man\\", & \\"Rashida\\" are excellent uptempo pop song while \\"Respectable Dive\\" & \\"Barbara\\" nice mellow ballads. Overall the only bad track on this album is the awful \\"Montauk\\" while the idea is sweet the execution of it is anything but. While it may not be \\"Release the Stars\\" it is definitely an improvement over his last one.

0345803485|3.0|...because it is essentially Twilight, it's so annoyingly transparent that I'm finding it hard to read it, but the smut is quite good. It's an incredibly easy read, but if you've got more than one brain cell you'll find it a bit irritating how much like Twilight it is. Anastasia \\"I prefer to be called Ana\\", oh I'm so shy and clumsy and just like Bella Swan, Christian, dark and moody, and ever so exactly the same as Edward Cullen. Jose, the other man, who really wants Ana, so basically Jacob Black. The bubbly fashionable friend who just loves to dress up Ana, name should be Alice, but that would make it too obvious. Oh and let's not forget her mum who has had multiple husbands, just like Bella's, and Ana's dad, who is just as communicative as Bella's. It really is very annoying! Even small parts are glaringly similar to Twilight. I'm tempted to just read the smutty bits online and fill in the rest with my own imagination, which could probably do a lot better.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I personally enjoyed the series, mostly the development of the characters. I would've loved to have had more in depth of Christian's background and less of the sex between Christian & Ana, which just got old after awhile.
B00756GKBA|5.0|In a world full of songs by Rihanna, Lady Gaga, and countless other female musicians, most of today's generation has seem to forgotten who started the game in the first place; Madonna. Granted, Madge's fame was at it's best in the eighties and nineties but one unique thing about Madonna is that she has never done the same thing twice. Poor radio play had to have been the downfall of this album because MDNA offers a fresh take on what the music scene is at the moment (2012.) This album has some of Madonna's best ballads to date. Her voice sounds much more mature. Also included are elements of dub step, electronic, and pop. The albums first 4 track are fine examples. Track 1. \\"Girl Gone Wild\\" this Benny Benassi produced single showcases Madonna's return to her dance roots while at the same time, providing a contemporary feel to the song. While not a chart topper, this single became a huge hit at clubs. The very best song on the album (in my opinion.) Track 2. \\"Gang Bang\\" Another great dance/electronic fused song telling the story of a woman seeking revenge on her lover. Track 3. \\"I'm Addicted\\" Another Benny Benassi produced song that once again is a feel good dance song. Track 4. \\"Turn Up The Radio\\" is a Martin Solveig produced single that is reminiscent of Madonna's early pop days. Other standout tracks include William Orbit produced \\"Love Spent\\" and the award winning song \\"Masterpiece.\\" While this album might not have been as epic as her previous records, it provides a fresh new take on today's music with an extra \\"Madonna feel\\" to it. Many were quick to criticize this album even before it's release due to today's generation taking a liking to Lady Gaga. Others felt Madonna was too old to be making dance music. Ridiculous statements either way, this album deserved much more love than it received. A great album! Definitely worth a listen.

B0016111B4|5.0|I may be considered a border-line authentic instrument fanatic, but I have my limits.  18th Century fortepianos do no justice to the music of Beethoven or Mozart; the music stands up rather well to a modern grand piano.  The same goes for the symphonies of Beethoven and Mozart.  I admit that the heavy hand of Bernstein, Böhm and von Karajan don't bear me out, but compare them with Mackerras and Krips, who both use a modern orchestra, but with a nobler hand.  My introduction to Josef Krips was in the late 50's when I got the complete Beethoven Piano Concerti for Christmas (Arthur Rubinstein was the pianist).  The first 3 concerti actually sound like music of the Classical Period; the 4th and 5th show the introduction of the Romantic Period.<br /><br />I love both the Pinnock and Marriner sets, but both set pale in comparison to the Krips Set on modern instruments.  I do however own the Symphonies 1 thru 20 by Marriner.  I realize my comments are my own and I speak for no one else.  I have no real criticism of either the Pinnnock or Marriner Set other than my preference here is the Krips Set.  I would recommend either of these 3 sets over any other that I have heard.  just remember that even the Mahler/Wagner conductors cannot totally ruin Mozart.  Beethoven and Mozart rise above even the worst readings.<br /><br />There appears to be some holes in the completeness of this set, but do your homework and you find that what is not there was probably not written my Mozart in the first place.  Whichever set you decide upon, get at least one and enjoy the divine spirituality of Mozart.  YOU DESERVE IT!!!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Super great zen and sleep aid , especially for free. Get it and try it, you wont regret it. Has sleep timeout,ability to combine noises and save combos. What more do you need?
B008MEM24S|4.0|this game is ok. I expected it to be a bit more different than the normal where's my water game. so if you really mile the original game then you should get this one too. but it is pretty much the same.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|his game is good for people that love challenges if u get frustrated fast I wouldn't try this game this game is fun and addicting.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I strongly prefer this one even to games made by the same developer like Bakery Story. You start small and gradually build up to a bigger and better restaurant preparing food and designing the restaurant to your taste. You can even take pictures of your restaurant to share. They add new content every week on top of the huge variety of appliances and decor they already have so there's always something new to have fun with and it's great that they have content themed for real world events like the Olympics or holidays.<br /><br />You can get new neighbors easily and it's fun visiting their restaurants to see what they've done with the place or leave tips. I agree that the placement of the ads and prompts for gems makes it easy to buy gems accidentally. I disabled in-app purchases so it's not a problem. Plus they offer support for accidental purchases (so I've heard). There's no way to disable accidentally SPENDING gems, though, so you just have to be careful with how fast you tap.<br /><br />The quality of the graphics and detail even in the food is really high compared to other games in this genre. Even the movement of the cute little characters that come to eat seems faster and more fluid. This game is great and it's the one app I look forward to keeping up with whenever I have a free minute and I haven't spent any real world money on it at all. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who likes games in this genre!<br /><br />Note: For people asking how to disable in-app purchasing on the Kindle Fire, you can either go to Settings Gear>More>Parental Controls and set a password or you can do it the way I did it by going to Apps>Store. Once in the store, click the menu button at the bottom (the square with three lines next to the arrow), click Settings, and click In-App Purchasing. Disable or enable it there. It'll ask for your Amazon password to do either. Hope that helps!helps!
B008MM9630|5.0|this game rocks so mch to do in the game and u don't need friends to advance in the game love it
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is a blast!  The degree of difficulty is just right and it's an easy game to learn.  What more could you ask from a game app?
006197806X|3.0|Normally, I procrastinate a bit before writing a review.  I generally finish it and then come back in a few days to write the actual review.  With this book, though, I'll just plunge right into the critique.  Caution, there will be spoilers--including some allusions to the ending, though I won't spell it out entirely.<br /><br />First and foremost, I have to say that this book is so much better than Delirium that I could hardly believe I was reading the same series.  I've seen much praise of Lauren Oliver's writing, but I'd only read Delirium and wasn't very impressed by it, so I didn't quite get what the fuss was about.  Now, after reading this book, I do.  Oliver writes beautifully.  She has a way of exploring the depths of grief that I found so beautiful and melancholic without being overdone.  Lena felt like a much deeper, richer character in this book.  She showed so much growth over the course of the book, and Oliver wrote that growth in such a way that I was entirely convinced.  I finally understood why she had been so praised, and I wholeheartedly agreed with that praise.  Lauren Oliver can really write lovely prose without it coming across as schmaltzy.  Had this been the first book in the series, I'd have had a much different view of the series as a whole.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Oliver's beautiful prose isn't enough to save the book from what I thought was its biggest trap: its predictability.  The moment Lena laid eyes on Julian, I just knew *exactly* where Oliver was going with it.  While I did think their romance was convincing, and while I really liked the way Oliver showed the tension between Lena's gradually developing feelings for Julian and the pain it made her feel because of her memories of Alex, I just knew the two of them were going to end up together by the end of the book.  While Lena's character is well done in this book, I thought Julian's was trite, a plot device designed to teach the reader something about the flip side, and the requisite boy from the \\"wrong\\" side of the tracks with whom Lena learns to see eye to eye.  It pretty much bored me.  And I saw the ending of the book coming from approximately 3,000 miles away, and all I could do was groan in frustration and say, \\"Oliver, not you too!  There's no rule that says this HAS to be done in YA lit.  I don't care if everyone else is doing it, why did you have to go there too?\\"<br /><br />The other big problem I had with this book is that I still cannot buy the premise behind Oliver's dystopia.  However, I did think she did a better job of hinting at an agenda in which the whole idea of deliria would make sense.  Still, as good as the world-building was in this book, it still to me lacked legitimacy.  The structure is good and well drawn, but the foundation is really too shaky to support it.  I think Oliver is reaching for some big ideas here, but she's either just scratching the surface because she intends to bust them out in full force in the next book, or she didn't quite make it up the mountain.  Either way, it seriously impeded my enjoyment of this book.  As good as it was, I kept falling out of the narrative because there was literally a voice in my head saying, \\"This dystopia doesn't make any sense.\\"  It created a sort of cognitive dissonance in my brain because one part of me was thinking, \\"Wow, this book is so beautifully written and well done.  I love it!\\" while another part of me was thinking, \\"Yeah, but I still don't buy that this dystopia could exist because it doesn't make sense.\\"<br /><br />On the other hand, the world building was good.  I liked that Oliver added extra layers of complexity with the addition of the Scavengers, the people living in the subway, and the tension between the Pandemonium-style religious fundamentalists and their more measured counterparts.  All of these things expanded the world considerably, gave it some new shades of gray, and made it clear just how overwhelming Lena's situation is.  These new factionsalso had a lot to say about human nature and how motivated by self-interest people can be.  I also thought the Wilds were well done, and I was fascinated by the homesteads and by the way the members of the resistance on the inside communicated with those on the outside.  Oliver also added a lot of extra emotional resonance to the book with her descriptions of the bombings.  They gave a concrete sense of just how far those in power are willing to go to protect that power.<br /><br />In the end, what's good about this book is really good and what's bad is bad.  This has the effect of placing the book firmly in the three star rating because the bad features tended to cancel out the good features for me, leaving me with that sense of \\"this book's not bad\\", which is obviously not much of a ringing endorsement.  Still, it did pull me back into the series and I am planning on reading the Hana story along with the third installment, which is more than I can say for the way I felt after Delirium, when I decided I wasn't going to bother to read the rest of the series.  I'm really hoping that Oliver will pull it all together in the end because the bottom line is that she's a very good, very literary writer.  As much as I love YA fic, it's a genre that would only benefit from an infusion of writers with talent like Oliver's.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I love romance novels, but this was way over the top!  I just can't understand the fuss.  It's basic erotica, nothing more.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this ap is great! It gives more detail than most weather aps and it was free!!  Don't pass this one up.
B005LAIGOQ|4.0|Based on the book of the same name by Susan Hill (which I have not read), this movie is good-scary. Creepy-scary. The kind of scary I like and can't often find. It's not gory, and it only has a couple of cheap-ish, jump-out-of-your-seat scares.  And it's a really good story to which I hope they make a sequel.  (UPDATE: They're making a sequel for 2014!)<br /><br />My husband and I rented this expecting it to be bad, to be quite honest. We hadn't heard much about it and figured it was because Daniel Radcliffe hadn't been able to pull out of Harry Potter-mode. In the very beginning, he actually is very Harry-ish when interacting with his character's son, and I almost wrote the movie off right then. But after that, he made me forget that he was Potter and I was glued to the TV.  The atmosphere is great (anything with possessed Victorian wind-up dolls creeps me right out), the acting is great (after those first few bumps), and it made for a believably scary story that entertained my socks off (which is a feat, considering how much I love wearing socks.)  Radcliffe made me believe his mourning and desperation without going over the top, and I absolutely loved the ending. I am super excited and can't wait for The Woman in Black: Angels of Death.
1451608659|5.0|The inside look at the world of gymnastic... it was like you tag along through ever hurdle with Dominique how she managed to succeed and win is inspirational!  I loved that it was released in time for the Olympics!!  The games were much more intense to view because of it.. knowing what all the girls have to go through to win.  I highly recommend a great book of a Champion!!!!!
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Heart breaking excellent read<br />Strong lead characters with a very real story line that is well written<br />Well worth reading if you like life and people reads.
B008BRC6NS|1.0|When I read about this CD, I was excited to maybe get some of those classic dance remixes on 1 disc.  NOPE.  Despite the fact, she's doing 100% dance music right now, she chose to put those AWFUL hip hop remixes on this CD.  I mean, she didn't even include the HEX HECTOR - Waiting for Tonight remix.  SMH.  Not very wise, Sista.

B0079XNWQA|2.0|I fell in love with Jason Mraz's style, voice, and personality when Waiting for My Rocket to Come was released. Since then, he's always varied his musical style, but stayed true to what first drew me to his songs. This latest effort was a major disappointment. The only enjoyable thing about listening to it was his voice, as I think he has an outstanding voice.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|It took me a long time to fall asleep untill I found this app that I can make my own melodies to fall asleep to. I even got my daughter to down load it for her tablet. It is worth the money to pay the extra for all of the features. Sleep had never come so much easier. Do not forget to set the timer so it shuts your device off. so awesome!
B004498KPU|5.0|I bought this item for my 7 year old son, who adores michael jackson. He would search you tube for MJ videos n sit quietly n watch anything with him in it. So this video was perfect..i enjoyed it myself..

B007UQ5Z1G|3.0|In the simplest terms I can put this, for my taste, this album has too much Mike and too little Chester.
B003EYFZFO|1.0|I have to agree with others that are NOT impressed with this release.<br /><br />I decided to buy the \\"Legacy Edition\\" since my CD copy of Raw Power (the 1997--Iggy remaster) is in another state. I was craving the specific sort of brutality Raw Power provides. So, I thought, \\"Sure! Why not get an alternate mastering plus some bonus material I didn't have...\\" It seemed a good investment to be able to hear one of my favorite albums again...<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Legacy Edition is frustrating to listen to. I'm not an authority regarding the history of the mixing process of this album. All I've read is the liner notes from the 1997 CD release, and it sounded like a mess--making/assembling an \\"album\\" seemed a daunting task. I have no idea what the original version sounded like, and this may be spot on. While some people find the 1997 version abrasive and \\"in the red,\\" that version at least attempts to harness the urgency and essence of this material. Plus, you can hear the BAND. The Legacy Edition showcases the vocals and lead guitar lines, well. However, I don't know what they did to make the rhythm section sound like they are several rooms away (i.e. VERY LOW in the mix).<br /><br />The most fun I've had listening to this version is turning it down (or off).<br /><br />Actually, it is entertaining at low volume in the car; you pretend some sort of tiny angry, drunken rambling man is having an argument with a guitar...which may be the deeper premise of Rock & Roll...??? Seriously, that's ALL you will hear.<br /><br />The original material and the band get a full five stars, but the \\"Legacy Edition\\" fails to deliver. At least the live tracks and other material soften the blow of spending $14.99.<br /><br />The bottom line is I'm looking forward to getting my CD back...
B0086700CM|3.0|It's ok but it keeps freezing.  Sometimes it's fun to play but after awhile it gets old.  I recamend this game but after you play it a lot it might tat bugs or it will get boring.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|This may come off as an expensive board game, but the value and entertainment you get from playing this easy-to-learn and highly social game is worth well beyond the $30 or so dollars you spend on it or the extra money put into expansions. Players have something to do almost every turn. There is a small element of luck with dice rolls, but strategy takes precedent 90% of the time. Trading is nothing like Monopoly and almost necessary to advance your building goals. Players are made to balance their choices turn by turn and make strategic builds and trades, but the concept and ease of play is remarkably great. For these reasons, definitely buy the game.<br /><br />However, for the price of the game you definitely expect the materials to be less flimsy. The sea tiles make setup a headache. From the start they were slightly warped. Getting them to interlock just so and stay that way is next to impossible. I count among my greatest Catan achievement just getting the board to stay set up perfectly through the whole game. One tile gets bumped which, consequentially, puts every other tile on the board askew. Presently, I am keeping the sea tiles under heavy books in an attempt to make them flat but 3 days in and no dice.<br /><br />Overall, I'm glad I bought the game for the fun times it gave my family and I, but cooperative and delicate board setup quenches the competitive mood pre-game.
B00000J2SR|4.0|By this time 'rainbow' was no longer a prog rock band. they were now selling well made strong hard rock songs. and this one had the hit 'street of dreams' on it. Joe lynn turner keeps up the great work as lead singer. The band here is tight and the songs well played , but fans of more expiremental prog rock would not agree that this is a great one. I like it alot and in fact rainbow didn't make a bad cd in their popular period from 1975-85 so if it's in that period you know you will get a good cd of hard rockin tunes done by pros. This is more commercial than the early stuff but it still has a good feel to it.
B007KZY1YY|1.0|if you are into mills and boon and sado masochism this is the book for you personally i find it disturbing HERES TO GOOD EQUAL SEX

B008MEM24S|4.0|I stayed up way too late playing this game!!!!  I finally put it op when it froze up and I had to reboot my kindle fire. other than that I've had no problems.
B004JUTHVK|4.0|At this point the band needed a hard rock cd. we had the scorps with a orchestra cd and two above average rockers from them , they did return with a vengence to hard rock though. This is a fine accoustic release though with the band doing most of their hits accoustically and they sound quite pretty here. So if you like accoustic music then grab this one and if you are a scorps fan you need this one in your collection.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|i love this game! it is so much fun.i would play it every second of the day if i could
B0013FBS20|5.0|I am surprised this movie doesnt have a higher rating.  I watched it back when it came out.  I just watched it again on Blu-Ray and it's just an excellent movie.  If youre not worried about trying to compare it to the book it was adapted from or to previous adaptions, I'm sure you will enjoy this.  Maybe my favorite Will Smith movie.  5 Stars!
B006HCCDO6|5.0|This CD has it all-great Earth Wind and Fire, George Benson, and incredible classic selections and \\"morning\\" music, stunningly gorgeous Vivaldi and Ludovico Einaudi- buy this CD and SEE the movie!
B008MJC6ZS|5.0|Love this CD! Sounds like good ol' Testament - great recording quality, awesome new songs, great covers, too! I definitely recommend this CD to any fan of hard rock, heavy metal, or testament
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Not really multiple books - about the length of one book, but well worth the price. Good story, good characters, I was quite  surprised and impressed.  My wife and I raced through the book, and our only disappointment was that it ended.<br /><br />Looking forward to more.

B001DWXUWY|5.0|I don't like every song on this album, but the good and the great ones are so awesome that I have to give it five stars anyway. I don't think it does any justice to try and say what other artists they sound like, they are there own band even if they wear some of their influences on their sleeves. If you think all music is crap these days then this album is an antidote. They're starting to get big these days so I worry if the fame, money, women, and drugs/alcohol will do to them what it's done to so many. Let's hope not. Either way we have this great album. Some songs are instant favorites, others are slow burners. This album is classic.
034580404X|5.0|I love reading the bad reviews - Obviously this book isn't an award winning novel but it's a light read that is suppose to be fun and pleasurable (literally!) haha. I'm assuming people that despise this book are either virgins with no sex life or married and over the age of 50. As far as I know in my mid 20s this book was extremely enjoyable! And I can speak for all my other girlfriends as well. The story was interesting and always made me want to turn the page. Didnt knownwhat to expect but once I started reading I couldn't stop! We were born sexual beings, lighten up and enjoy this erotic novel :) I loved it!!
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|I took my kids to see this movie not once but twice in the theater. We loved the songs and I loved the message of the movie.  We do a lot as a family to help the environment and this type of movie is really what kids need to watch and talk about. It made my kid's realize that not all material items are a need, when companies manufacture such items all the damage to nature and the environment is the effect.  I loved that it was a musical, we bought the cd immediately after the show. LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie! My 4, 5, and 10 year old loved it just as much!

B004J4WQ46|5.0|This is a GREAT album by the strokes. A bit different from the previous albums, but still more of the awesome. It's easy to see how their could be tension in this band, as they are all so talented. Structurally speaking, this is the best music out. The guitar playing alone is amazing. It's completely different than anything else and enough to make someone want to pick up guitar playing for the first time since high-school. A MUST BUY for any true music fan.
B007ZZKWHY|5.0|Everyone says this was a B movie, and with it's budget I suppose technically it is, but the CG, acting, and everything else make it feel like an A movie. I'd give it 6 stars if possible just for the sheer awesomeness of it.<br /><br />If you're looking for a sci fi movie with actual good acting, solid CG, a pretty believable story line, and side splitting one liners, this is it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like that there are so many translations available. I love the fact you include reading plans also. Best purchase I have made so far. Thank you.
B0064Y5U24|5.0|This, in my opinion is the best of Nickleback, thus far, I'm sure there will be more to come from this band.
B002I9Z89Y|3.0|Again, CBS video was asleep at the wheel when this was made.  Not in broadcast order.  Have to jump from disc to disc to what in order.  A real moronic series.
0670023329|5.0|I read this book several months ago and it still haunts me.  I cannot believe that we allow scum like the Kim family (North Korean Dictators) to exist in the world today.  The world has learned nothing from Hitler and Stalin apparently.  This gives good insight into the tools and psychology that these evil dictators use to stay in power.
B003CN4R74|3.0|I understand what Amy tried to do with this record. I give her credit for writing tunes that are diverse and evolving, combining influences and exploring atmosphere.  My problems are only few. I didn't like how the songs had to be surrounded by distorted guitars and rollicking piano as if Evanescence would lose its fan-base if there was anything but. As diverse as Amy is with her stated influences, I'm not sure why the songs had to be anchored to past albums in this way. The tired power-chords can't possibly be what Amy really wants, song after song. Can it?  Don't get me wrong. Even though I detest the droning sound, I still enjoy the talent. There are more than a few good songs here, but they could have been better.  I'm a musician, a consumer and this is just my opinion. I'll always be a sucker for the gothic orchestral atmosphere, the operatic verses and giant choruses that Evanescence is capable of. I just wish they would evolve the guitars to be more daring/creative and span some octaves. Bring in the classic-rock influences because the distortion is tired and drowning possibilities in a dying genre of rock. Graduate the talent!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|get into playing this awesome game.<br /><br />play this intriguing game remmiscent of Mario brothers. full of interesting levels to keep you on your toes. very enjoyable.
0765365278|5.0|Way better than I expected, this has earned a spot in my favorites.  First Sanderson book I've read, I'm now a fan
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Steve Jobs, it turns out, was even a more complicated person than most of us thought. This book tells the whole story of his life and along the way, the story of early Apple, Pixar, NeXT and late Apple after Jobs return. As a Mac enthusiast, this book was immediately interesting to me. It's long, but is very interesting throughout so it doesn't seem to be too long or drag on. This man was flawed, especially when dealing with too many of his friends and employees. But he did learn to a degree that he needed to control his emotional outbursts. His creative genius made Apple and Pixar what they are today and much can be learned from Steve Jobs. Some of the most valuable take always from this book are how not to treat your employees!
030758836X|4.0|I've read - in a row -sharp objects - in a day - then came Dark Places - I read that in 2  days because I loved it so much I didn't want it to end and then I was sooo excited to read Gone Girl. I HATE HATE HATE to say I Was disappointed - it wasn't as hard core as Ms. Flynn's other two I think she was shying away from writing about \\"the same thing\\" because in Sharp Objects and Dark Places there are heavy similarities but Dark PLaces was probably the best book I've ever read - if not up there in the top 10<br /><br />Gone Girl starts when a woman disappears - a diary is found and everything is pointing to the husband murdering her. Having read her other two novels I was aware immediately that not all is what it seems so there would be twists and turns and her dialogue and the story itself are so well written that I can forgive the fact that my heart wasn't in my mouth and after I got to a certain point I pretty much knew what, not exactly what was going to happen, but it wasn't the nail biting experience of Dark Places ( I am, I will admit obsessed with that book and NEVER read a book twice but may make an exception for this novel.<br />Back to Gone Girl. I liked it on a scale of one to ten I give it an 8- Ms. Flynn does have the knack and I predict this was merely a calm before her storm she's testing her chops to move on to other area. I will admit though that the ending was a bit terrifying in a wow that could actually really happen and to a certain extent probably does in most marriages - when you read it youll know what i mean - how many people are trapped??? Trapped in a marriage where the husband and wife do nothing but play mind games with each other? and the passion that once kept then together or brought them together rather, is now laced with seeds of contempt and despair?<br /><br />It is an enjoyable read and had I read this first>??

B0083SBMBM|5.0|--------------------------------------------------------------<br />\\"Marvel's The Avengers\\"<br />(2012)<br />--------------------------------------------------------------<br />This is without question the best live-action superhero film made to date -- it hits all the right marks and leaves audiences eager for more. It's thrilling, it's funny, the special effects look great, and the action feels real (no stiff, overly-armored Batman here!) and it reflects the appeal of comicbooks and comicbook culture better than any other adaptation I've seen.<br /><br />All praise is due to director Joss Whedon, who also co-wrote the script and (miraculously!) kept this from being one of those blechhy, top-heavy, written-by-Hollywood-committee monoliths that we've seen so far. The exposition is kept to a minimum, the lulls are lightened by classic Whedon humor, and the actors are treated like actors, not sort sort of squishy furniture you drape special effects around. Whedon, a guy that actors love, coaxes superior performances from Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlet Johansson, while Chris Evans' and Chris Hemsworth's presences are greatly enhanced from their solo debuts in \\"Captain America\\" and \\"Thor\\"; ditto for Thom Hiddleston as their nemesis, Loki, who was sort of okay in \\"Thor,\\" but great here. Samuel Jackson, intoning and pretentious in his role as Machiavellian uber-spy Nick Fury, drains the life out of every scene he's in, but that's sort of to be expected, and I'm willing to overlook it since the rest of the film is so awesome.<br /><br />I'm 1000% serious when I say Joss Whedon should be appointed the head of a studio: his time has come. He has almost single-handedly taken a genre that has been limping and misshapen for years, grievously misunderstood and poorly realized by the Hollywood machers, and made it into something magical and thrilling.<br /><br />He. Gets. It.<br /><br />Of course, if Whedon were put in charge, that might impede his ability to write and direct, but good god it would be great to have someone who can make something this good be in charge for a while. Warner should just appoint him the head of their superhero movie division for the next five-to-ten years and let him whip the genre into shape. All they need to do is make movies that are fun, and not so packed with dense exposition, and make 'em look good with strong, intelligent scripts. Whedon has done it here: this is the template.

B005ETA5K2|3.0|I have 2 of these alfa 36nhr, the first one had good reception for about a month (3 to 4 bars) then reception was terrible 1 bar or no bar. I stop using it, 6 months later I got the other one, it had great reception for about 3 months but then the same thing happen. I suspect there is some sort of quality control issue with the soldering between the antenna and actual chipset. I seen people on youtube do actual repairs on this chipset. I own the alfa36h, the alfa 36neh and also the turbotenna and consider myself an expert on wifi. All my adapters are plugged to a cantenna for the best reception but that doesnt improve the quality on the alfa 36nhr and would be worst without the cantenna. But even when it shows very low connection quality, this alfa 36nhr beats all the rest in staying connected and download speeds. But its not more powerful then the alfa 36h, which shows 4 or 5 bars everytime. I recommend if your near your wifi station or have a cantenna which you can point at the wifi station. I still use mine but know its limitations.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|----------------------------------------------------------<br />\\"Prometheus\\" (2012)<br />----------------------------------------------------------<br />In this eerie prequel to the \\"Aliens\\" franchise, director Ridley Scott shows himself firmly in command, a skillful, dynamic auteur with a capacity to evoke wonder and inspire awe. Although tied to the Alien films, \\"Prometheus\\" is creepy and suspenseful but doesn't dwell in the high-octane gore of the original films -- it's there, but it's not the whole point of the film.  Instead, big concepts about the conquest of space, cosmic seeding and the spiritual yearnings of aliens, androids and man are probed and examined, and many big questions are left dangling, tantalizingly in need of further exploration. I can't remember a recent movie I've wanted a sequel of more than this one - I'm itching to see what happens next!<br /><br />In addition to the direction and special effects, the acting is also pretty good. I did not care much for the pair of lead actors Noomi Rapace and Logan Marshall-Green (the scientists behind the expedition) although Charlize Theron is fine as their unlikable corporate minder, and Idris Alba is fun as the noble spaceship captain (with major props to the supporting actors who played his crew...) The breakaway star of this show, though, is the steely-eyed Michael Fassbender, who plays David, the film's obligatory android, who is a spine-tingling combination of 2001's HAL and Star Trek's Data, one of the best portrayals of an AI being you'll ever see. Truly delicious. The aliens look cool, too.<br /><br />Bravo for Ridley Scott, who is back in the saddle again... Hopefully the studios will be smart and keep him at the helm for the planned sequels... Can't wait until they're out! (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)

B007F8I64C|3.0|The review of this book \\"Mein Kampf\\" is quite adventitious because the judgement of this book will be reviewed on several accounts. The book does not follow an outline. The paragraphs are repeated at length by introducing the same subjects over and over again. He starts this narrative after being in prison on October, 1924 with a sentence of five years of that amount he served eighteen months. During this time he wrote about his stay in Austria that had an Alliance with Germany. He was born into a middle class family and he wanted to go to art school that was violently opposed by his father, his father died which released him from that problem. After his mother died he went to Vienna to architecture school, that was a desperate time  since he had only a small amount of money earned intermittently by whatever job he could find, the lack of funds threw him in the slums with the very poor people. During this time he form his opinions about Jews, Negroes and the Socialist party and other political groups.<br /><br />He went to war and fought and was under the impression that Germany should have won the war had it not been for the Revolution of the Austians in 1918, Jews and Socialistic party. He gains employment and this is when he started to compile the information on political oganizations. He advanced his egotistical thoughts to help find a new oaganization called National Socialistic Workers Party.<br /><br />I find this book to be very challenging, because of the authors' rambling thoughts, his writings are based on circular thoughts, and from arm chair philosophers. It is a very interesting book becauee it allows the reader the opportunity to discover the orgins of some of the thoughts that continue as predjudice and racism today.<br /><br />Not only did he form opinions, but they were biased, illogical, and meant to motivate the masses<br /><br />SPR<br /><br />[[ASIN:0394700449 The Anatomy of Revolution]]<br />[[ASIN:B005FOIRFG The Psychology of Revolution]]<br />[[ASIN:0982604025 Angry Mobs and Founding Fathers: The Fight for Control of the American Revolution]][[ASIN:0521586003 Revolutions 1789-1917 (Cambridge Perspectives in History)]]/>[[ASIN:0982604025 Angry Mobs and Founding Fathers: The Fight for Control of the American Revolution]][[ASIN:0521586003 Revolutions 1789-1917 (Cambridge Perspectives in History)]]

The knowledge that Michael bestows upon the readers of Bigger Leaner Stronger is credible and he takes the time to make sure that we not only know the hows, but the whys. This is definitely a great purchase for any fitness enthusiast!
B007MDB71O|5.0|My husband saw this movie with his buddy, and then took me to see it.  I really enjoyed it -- action/adventure, romance, and a wonderful dog character.  I'm now delighted to have my own copy at home pre-ordered the 4-disc set).  Since it was planned as a trilogy, I'm hoping the studio will go ahead with the sequel soon.

B000003TA2|4.0|I'm reading a bio of the band right now by David Browne. It's really good, if you're wondering. Totally have to read it if you're so inclined.<br /><br />I just got to the part where they record Goo. It was the record they made right after Daydream Nation (my fav of theirs), and also the first record they made for a major label (Geffen records).<br /><br />Here is what Kim Gordon (bassist, vocalist for Sonic Youth) had to say about this record:<br /><br />\\"Talking about the record (Goo) with a friend, Kim seemed particularly dejected. 'That's not us, that's not Sonic Youth,' she told him. Later, she told a friend that when she heard the final mixes, she started crying\\" (Browne 210).<br /><br />Now, this is my favorite SY record after Daydream. I find it so odd that she felt that way, and that things in the studio were so problematic and difficult.
034580404X|5.0|I expected the book to be good and I was not disappointed.  Once I started reading the series, I was hooked! The only time I eased up on reading was when I got near the end of the last book and I slowed down then only because I didn't want the story to end.  Ana and Christian feel like people that I've gotten to know - INTIMATELY. The way Ana tells the reader what she's thinking, seeing and feeling at every step along the way as she falls for the \\"beautiful\\" Christian Grey is so captivating that I felt like I was having an intimate conversation with a very good friend.<br /><br />I borrowed the first book from my neighbor. (She loves the trilogy too.) My best friend, who is reading the trilogy for the THIRD time, gave me a Kindle Gift Card for my birthday so that I could buy the Kindle edition of all three books.  Once I downloaded the books to my Kindle, I read it in the bathtub, in the car (Text-to-Speech is a great feature), at work (during breaks and lunch periods of course), in resturants, etc.<br /><br />I finished the book about a week ago but I missed Ana and Christian so much that now I find myself re-reading the book. I'm up to Chapter 4 of the 1st book. Those who have read it may be able to relate. For those who have not, ONCE YOU'VE READ IT, YOU WILL UNDERSTAND!
B003UYUP58|5.0|Without a doubt this is one of the best books I have ever read. Dr. Siddhartha Mukherjee has written what I believe is one of the most approachable medical books available. As the father of a son with neuroblastoma I read this with a certain fascination for where the cancer came from. While it  did not explicitly address Neuroblastoma it gave me so much insight that I really feel like I know cancer almost inside and out. This is a must read for anyone who is been touched by cancer. Heck, it's a must read for just about anybody.

B000092Q4U|5.0|I wasn't a fan of Lamb of God before this release. The riffs were good, but I found the production to be poor and the vocals annoying (style and cadence that Blythe used). Things changed on 'As The Palaces Burn'. This CD is a total blistering barnburner of heavy metal that blows away anything that LOG has done before or since. I've bought several of the later CDs which are OK, but just don't stack up to this one. I don't know what to say except that the riffs are masterful and the songs make my head bang EVERY time. Blythe gets a little more varied in his vocal delivery, just enough to make it work for me.

B007I2BZIE|3.0|I can't. The musicianship on display here is incredible as it always is with Rush. But I was hoping for a return of their glory days of the time period starting with Farwell To Kings and ending with Moving Pictures. For me, this album dosen't reach that benchmark at all. I can tell they're trying, but it doesn't make it for me.<br /><br />The main reason being is all the things that made them so great at their zenith aren't here, to my ears at least. The thing that's missing from this album that those other albums had is hooks. I don't hear any on here. Lots of heavy prog rock for heavy prog rock's sake but the melodies just never seem to materialize.<br /><br />I don't get from this album what I get from my favorite Rush albums, hooks that rock progressively. Sorry to say, this one misses the mark for me. Not a bad album, it's worth listening to, it just won't make it's way into heavy rotation in my library. Kudos to you though Rush for keeping the faith.

0525478817|5.0|The lingering tears that creased my eyes as I finished Hazel's story would not be sufficient proof for the effect Green's book had on me. I think he has managed to create that third space he writes about in the novel, a space where the reader and the book unite in a crescendo, where the words no longer seek to be read, but to be honored and to be remembered for infinity. 'The Fault in our Stars' is not just about two cancer-ridden teenagers, their angst and their motivations for fighting this distraught battle. I found it to be a poignant and utterly tacit work on what all of us seek, what we get, and what we don't. How we fight our battles and what those battles truly are. Being encumbered by a disease can incite a radical notion, a strong desire to leave a mark that Augustus so badly wanted to leave, so that oblivion would not grasp him and leave him breathless. But Green uses cancer not so much as a tool to make us appreciate his characters more, but to allow us to remember that we are all a part of this juggernaut of life, and that this was a story he wished would make love, friendship and all the 'metaphors' of life seem relevant again. And it did. For all its worth Gus, I will follow the risen sun, and see the light. Take a bite off this book. Maybe you will find yourself afflicted with love as I did.

B0000DZ3EN|5.0|First off i would like to say If you are a true fan of oz this is the best Film experince you will get for Oz. When I say true fan is that you have read all the books their is 14. The charactors likeness to the original illustrations is uncanny and made me really happy to see come to life. The Oz book series is a childrens series but as many great children series there is a fasinating dark side. You were or are a child you understand if you have any imagination. I am now 23 I saw this movie when i was ten and knew what to expect. Hence my mother read the whole series to me. Like all fairytales this movie has a dark side. Princess Mombi is still to this day terrorfiying. But if you have good parents and a good head I dont see the harm in watching this movie which is pure magic. Its charactor Building ;P

0812993292|5.0|When I heard Rachel Joyce interviewed by Diane Rehm on National Public Radio, I thought I'd just \\"give this novel a go.\\" (Do I sound a wee bit British there?) And when I began my journey into it--my reading pilgrimage albeit not exactly an unlikely one--I knew immediately I would have to make myself read at the pace of Harold Fry's walk. Slow. He suffered blisters. I suffered nothing except the annoyance of telling myself that this was like a box of chocolates--no, I am not about to Forrest Gump you: enjoy the taste of one at a time, one chapter at a time because otherwise I would be far too quickly done. Some novels are to be savored. And this is certainly one of those.<br /><br />This novel is, as the Brits say, \\"brilliant! Just brilliant!\\" Harold has been married to Maureen for over forty years, has recently retired from a job he disliked in most respects with a truly horrific boss. And one day \\"the post\\" delivers a pink envelop addressed to Harold and in it a short note from Queenie saying she has been diagnosed with cancer and is now in hospice care. He worked with Queenie. She is in Berwick-upon-Tweed which, according to the map at the beginning of the novel, is just over the English border with Scotland. Harold lives in Kingsbridge. No, I too knew not of the location of either. But there it is on the map, just as far away from Queenie as he could possibly be and still be within the confines of the landmass the houses England, Wales and Scotland, right down on the English Channel.<br /><br />Harold writes a short note and wearing his yachting shoes--canvas ones I assume, probably what we call Dockers--makes his way to the nearest postslot, stopping to chat for a moment with his neighbor, now a widower. But on his way--mind you, he has nothing but what he walked out of the house with--he calls the hospice and tells the person on the other end to tell Queenie to stay as well as she can, that he is on his way. He has no luggage, but he calls Maureen to tell her. She, of course, is astonished. He has no map, no idea of how to get there other than to head north. He has led a rather provincial life.<br /><br />Maureen is, as an American friend of mine would say, \\"a piece of work.\\" She reminds me somewhat of Hyacinth Bucket (Patricia Rutledge) in the BBC sitcom \\"Keeping Up Appearances\\" but without the outrageous attire \\"Mrs. Bouquet\\" wears.<br /><br />So along the way--and the reader can keep track of the slowness of the journey by checking out the map--we are provided with back stories, about Harold's failures as a husband and father to only child David--he is quite the mystery for much of the novel--and of Harold's disengaged parents we well as Maureen's, about the lack of any type of relationship they now have. And about Queenie. But, of course, Harold meets a lot of people along the way, staying in inns and B&Bs. One couple, identically dressed for hiking, seem like the perfect match until the husband opens his mouth: full of advice, especially for what Harold should be wearing. \\"It occurred to Harold that he [the hiker] was one of those people who didn't require other people in order to have a conversation.\\" And then this from his wife: \\"'Personally I liked the Cotswolds [the husband had said they did not].' said his wife. 'I know it's more flat, but it's romantic.' She twiddle her wedding ring so hard it looked as if she might unscrew her finger.\\" (page 73) And this when Harold arrives in Exeter and visits a cathedral: \\"It struck him as strange but true that tourists bought trinkets and souvenirs of religious places because they had no idea what else to do when they got there.\\" (page 84) That is just a very small taste of the brilliant little pieces of this very brilliant 300 page novel.<br />Then there comes a real surprise near the end although all the pieces had been laid out for that short chapter, a letter to the girl who inspired Harold to go on his pilgrimage<br /><br />This is a coming-of-age story, but not one ofa young person stepping from innocence into life's realities. Instead it is a journey--an \\"unlikely pilgrimage\\"--in which a 65-year-old man who's lived a rather isolated and not very happy life walks into a broader world: \\"He understood that in walking to atone for the mistakes he had made, it was also his journey to accept the strangeness of others.\\" Amen!a young person stepping from innocence into life's realities.

I guess when Harvard grows bored with something they just close those doors and build a new wing, an leave all the 1980's computers, memory-deprivation tanks and electron microscopes just sitting there parked on valuable real estate?

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a book that you cannot put down, just finished the book and going onto the next book. Great writing. I am not a great reader usually to busy to sit down and read but once I started WOW I could not put it down. Glad all my female friends advised me to read this book, I heard the 2nd book is better than the first, hard to believe but off I go starting on the second book

B007VUA7VO|4.0|It works well and I was able to choose my favrite color for my battery. Well I have nothing else to say.
B002U6DVQM|2.0|I tried to watch the Criterion edition of this movie knowing how highly regarded it is.<br /><br />I found that while the movie has considerable dialogue (and fast Italian dialogue) the subtitles seems to only be present for very little of it--with some sentences seeming to not even be completed.  It is fragmentary at best.<br /><br />I find the movie unwatchable as I am staring to try to understand the movie (which is complex enough as it is) and feeling frustrated.  Is this a flaw on my copy or is this the way this edition is?<br /><br />I normally have no trouble with subtitles and own many foreign films in my collection.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|very handy to have. I really like the fact that it gives you time left for several different activities as I use my kindle fire for a variety of things not just reading.
1936891026|4.0|He has a different approach to procrastination and how to deal with it. One thing I would disagree is, he is kind of describing the reason of addiction as procrastination. It is most definitely true for some cases, but not all addiction issues can be deducted simply to procrastination. But other than that, very helpful information.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a very entertaining game ! I can play this for hours at a time. I recommend this game to all you bored people out there.
0345803507|1.0|The books are over priced. Very over priced. I feel cheated and robbed by Amazon. I finished the story because I truly wanted to know how it ended.<br /><br />1.  If she had an editor, they should be fired.<br /><br />2.  I hated her \\"inner goddess\\".  She mentioned this every couple of pages. EVERY. COUPLE. OF. PAGES<br /><br />3.  The sex scenes, while good, are not as good as Brynn Paulin's.<br /><br />4.  I am so disappointed. I cannot believe I paid $10 a book.  They are truly badly written.<br /><br />They should have remained fan fiction.  If you wanted to truly profit, they should have been<br />Priced more reasonably. I won't buy anything else by this writer. I learned my lesson.

B0086QS7N2|5.0|One hour, six minutes and four seconds ??  [1.06.04]<br /><br />I will admit that the first time I listened to Clockwork Angels I didn't love it.  BUT as with any masterpiece it does take time to understand - digest - quantify... I just returned from an 11 hour van ride with 10 college age kids that are used to listening to pop - country and assorted musical fluff.  I played Clockwork Angels in a loop the whole trip and never once did they complain and some actually began to understand after following the \\"journey\\" from the Caravan to The Garden.  You will see that Peart is truly a master story teller, and the Lifeson & Lee orchastration is excellent.<br /><br />I personally feel this is the best album of their career.

1608193381|4.0|First thing that those on the (far) left should keep in mind is that Chang falls into what is known as \\"heterodox economics\\" and has a bit of a Keynesian flair, which means that this book provides a critique of contemporary capitalism and \\"free\\"-market capitalism from another type of capitalism (\\"with a Human face\\" as Zizek would say). So, do not expect any critique involving the abolition of capitalism and if you're part of the revolutionary left, i.e. libertarian-socialists, left-communists, council-communists, etc, try to not have an aneurism since any mention of \\"communism\\" or \\"communists\\" refers strictly to Euro-communism or Leninism. That said, the book does a great job at dispatching the ideology of those who support \\"free\\"-markets and trickle-down economics which are very popular now days in the U.S. with the rise of the Tea-baggers and those on the Republican party trying to appeal to them.
B008MEM24S|1.0|stupid stupid. where is the water!!! so many glitches! there's not even water!!! the laser is the only thing that works. ugh. don't let good reviews fool you. creaters of the game write there own reviews. did you notice a lot were put on the site the same date and time? so sad:(
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|so far the transfer from my phone to the computer and other devices has been exactly what i was looking for. and with how often i break my phones and lose everything on the HD... this is very useful.

B004MC8CA2|4.0|It is easy to use, love that it has voice reading for many translations. Love that you can create your own bible study  plan. Lo e that you can add your own notes. Improvements 1) make it available off line. 2) add a Greek and Hebrew strongs con. I recomend this app especially for those who have trouble reading.
B006YZOXHQ|1.0|Barbarella isn't a great movie. It's slow and the Direction is lackluster. But the reason I like it is for the campy look and feel which gives it a sharp contrast with that other classic Sci-fi movie of 68, Planet of the Apes. It's kinda like how I enjoy The Fifth Element more than most of the Sci-fi flicks of the last two decades and that's because of its emphasis on Fantasy with a European flavor. Anywho, I can't believe that they had the nerve to put this movie out on Blu-ray in this condition. It's clear that they didn't spend a penny to digitally re-master this movie beyond transferring it. In comparison, H.G. Lewis' Blood Feast came out in 1963 and the Blu-ray is STUNNING considering that it was shot five years before Barbarella and for a fraction of the cost. No, I'm afraid that this was a cheapo transfer and I regret buying it, especially considering that there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING in the way of extras except for a horrifically grainy trailer which looks even worse than the feature. About the only thing I can recommend is the fantastic original poster art that they use for the cover. In hindsight I should have just bought a copy of the poster.<br /><br />DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
B004SBQGHS|1.0|as with the update for angry birds space, all game data and scores are DELETED! this is only happening with Amazon's version for the updates. its infuriating that I have to start all over just a couple long awaited new levels!! it would be worth buying the app in the android market before considering downloading ANY updates thru Amazon.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I am the oldest sister in my family. I have two sisters who argues over toys and playing the same game.  Sometimes they drive me up the wall and I can't seem to get rid of my frustration of them fighting. So I tried this app and it helps a lot.

B006R8GK2Q|5.0|enjoyed the many mini games. Each is different enough to hold your interest. Wish there was more guidenance on the star gazer aligning the threads, didn't figure it out until the very end.  A bit pricy for me too.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very addicting and stimulates your mind to think out of the box on the harder puzzles.  Definitely an app to download for all ages
B005FJ7DOM|4.0|This movie was well done. The plot and character development was fairly well done. I would watch it again. For a lower budget film, it beat alot of others out there..
B008BHH606|4.0|The first thing I want to say about this album is that I am a fan of the band. I own all of their studio albums and have liked them for years. This is not a bad album, but it is a serious departure from what we have had from them before. I'll be reviewing the songs one-by-one, because each one seems to stand on its own here. Every single song on the first half seems to have a weird opening guitar riff that doesn't add much to the song in my opinion.<br /><br />1. The Future Is Now - 8.5/10<br />I'd like to rate this one higher, but how derivative of Rise Against it is bothers me a lot. This is an upbeat song with a lot of energy. The lyrics take a backseat to how they're being said. It feels very typical of a modern punk song, with loud singing over a basic and uninteresting guitar.<br /><br />2. Secrets From The Underground - 9/10<br />This is one of those punk songs that is a great chorus and not a lot else. It follows a very similar formula to the first track, but I rate it a bit higher because it'd more interesting. The lyrics are basically meaningless, typical punk \\"we're going to have an uprising and the president is going to die\\" stuff.<br /><br />3. Days Go By - 10/10<br />I love this song. It's incredibly catchy, and has some lyrics that don't just sound good, but also give the message very effectively. It's just a good rock song with a lot less anger than the past two tracks.<br /><br />4. Turning Into You - 9.5/10<br />Another high-energy track, but this time a lot more meaningful. There's some real introspection going on here that's probably a little deeper than I'm willing to think about it. The best part about it is how it builds up to the pre-chorus, where all the energy is released and the chorus leads you back down.<br /><br />5. Hurting As One - 7.5/10<br />The chorus consists of one lyrics and some background yelling, and the verses are not pronounced very clearly. Something about the way the \\"b\\" in \\"blood\\" is pronounced makes me flinch a little,which is probably an unfair way to rate the song.<br /><br />6. Cruising California (Bumpin' In My Trunk) - 2/10<br />Oh dear. I know this is a parody, but I'm just annoyed in every way by this. It's not clever or funny, just annoying. If they didn't throw in a catchy beat, I'd probably be more tolerant. As it is, it's just this annoying mess of a song that will likely get more radio play than the rest of their songs combined.<br /><br />As a side note, hearing Dexter talk about a woman \\"waving her caboose at you\\" followed by a \\"uh-huh\\" straight from Pretty Fly For A White Guy is an experience I wish I could forget.<br /><br />7. All I Have Left Is You - 10/10<br />It's really such a nice break after hearing Cruising California. Legitimate emotions, just a touch of depth, and pretty good sequel to Fix You or Kristy Are You Doing Okay. The drums sound really off, but I try not to let that dampen my enjoyment. \\"And we're holding on when there's nothing left to hold on to.\\" Other than being somewhat poetic, the melodies of the two guitars and the harmony from the background singing is great.<br /><br />8. OC Guns - 8/10<br />Gah, I don't know what they were thinking. This song is along the same lines as Cruising California, but at least it doesn't actually aggravate me. This song is like Original Prankster stripped of all elements of rock music. Some of the music at the end redeems the song, however. I like the short guitar solo and outro the most.<br /><br />9. Dirty Magic - 8.5/10<br />Mediocre remake of a great song. There is much heavier distortion and a more processed sound to everything. Dexter also sings a different tone than he did in the original. It's sort of like playing Halo: Anniversary Edition versus Halo: Combat Evolved. There are lots of changes, and it's technically better, but a lot of the crisp cleanliness and charm of the original is lost in the muck.<br /><br />10. I Wanna Secret Family (With You) - 7.5/10<br />It's just so poppy I could die. It'shalfway between Cruising California and a good song, so I gave it an appropriate score. The lyrics are incredibly shallow, at one point the word \\"swag\\" is used. I'm just not comfortable with this song in general, but if you don't listen to the words, there's definitely some music appeal.<br /><br />11. Dividing By Zero - 10/10<br />My favorite upbeat song of the album. It sounds like it's the \\"Hammerhead\\" of the album, with a similar guitar riff and chorus. There is a sense of anxiety and fear in the song that is rare to see in music that isn't metal. Some of the lyrics feel like they were pulled out of nowhere and don't seen to fit, but it's a good way to end the album... except there's one more.<br /><br />12. Slim Pickens Does The Right Thing And Puts A Very Long Title On This Song - 9/10<br />It seems to switch between disgust and anger and despair repeatedly throughout the song, creating three distinct sections to the finale song. I'm a little disappointed in the guitar solo, being the verse's vocal melody... on the guitar. It's incredibly uninspired. I like how you can tell specifically what The Offspring are referring to, and who they're angry at when they write this song, unlike the average punk song's \\"Down with you guys and up with my guys!\\"<br /><br />Overall - It's a good album, but if you don't count the bad songs, it's sort of a short one. It has little in common with their old stuff, something made painfully obvious by Dirt Magic's remake, but with the way music is going I'm counting my lucky stars that this album turned out as well as it did.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|PLAY THIS GAME!! YOU GET TO ADD UR FRIENDS!! YOU GET TO BUY COLORS!! AWESOME!! I LUV IT!! I THINK THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!!
B004LWZWC4|5.0|Decided to watch this based on a snippet I saw on HBO while channel surfing.  What a sweet, warm-hearted movie.  Completely agree with other reviewers that this is a movie the whole family can enjoy, yet with themes that are a little deeper than you might expect for a \\"movie about bird watching\\".  This is probably the most laid-back that I've ever seen Jack Black in a movie, and what a pleasant departure it was.  Enjoyed it completely from start to finish.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|bad controls for the games. very sticky and laggy. the games are weird too. but its free so go for it
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|You need to uninstall, lose your data to accept the most recent update? I love this game, but not enough to do it all over again.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app has a lot of interesting features that informs you of the status if your battery and gives you a history of your usage so that you know when you use your battery the most.  It's a well designed app that functions quite nicely... Great job devs...

0439023491|5.0|Often times an author has trouble following up the first book in a series. I'm happy to say, that's not the case here!<br /><br />The story managed to tick all right boxes. The characters stay true to themselves. The story is interesting, unpredictable, and logical. I'd expected the second book to focus on Katniss being a mentor for the next hunger games, but nothing could be further from what actually happens.<br /><br />I was happy to see more of all my favorite characters: Katniss, Peeta, and Haymitch. The story felt fresh. I'm used to being able to see where a story is going from early on, with the reading being an exercise in enjoying prose. That simply wasn't the case here, I was constantly wondering what would happen next. I meant to read the book in dribs and drabs in spare time, but got so interested I wound up finishing it in just a few sittings.<br /><br />Catching fire is a great read, and a worthy successor to its predecessor, [[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games]]. If you haven't read this series, you should!
0553807919|3.0|I'm very excited to read this book, particularly after hearing parts of the author's address at the Responsive Classroom's Responsive Schools conference.  When I opened my copy today, I thought I was holding it crooked.  The pages are cut unevenly (compared to each other AND most not in a straight line) and the book jacket size doesn't match the general size of the pages. If I didn't need to read it quickly this week, I'd return for a better copy.  Hard to imagine how any human being saw this and shipped it....or do they get printed and shipped without a human being ever laying hands or eyes on such books?
B00005614M|2.0|I am a big Miles fan and was disappointed with this album. It's probably just me....but I like the \\"Sketches of Spain\\", \\"Kinda Blue\\" or \\"Porgy and Bess\\" sound. This is a little bit too fast for me to really enjoy.
B004AGI2L4|2.0|You have a film here with some B list actors and a C list script. The costumes are decent and the actors are good enough but with a script with that's predictable, well worn plot twists and an unrealistic story you can only expect so much. The fights scenes are well executed but the C.G.I. blood splatter is unneeded and distracting besides being unrealistic. It's a good 100 min distraction if you have Amazon prime. It sucks if you have to pay for it.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|\\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" is the conclusion of director Christopher Nolan's superb \\"Batman\\" trilogy, with Christian Bale as the Batman.  This is no ordinary superhero movie, even by the high standards of Nolan's two previous Batman features.  This is movie-making on an epic scale, with a large and capable cast, tons of special effects, and a narrative that appears to draw heavily from Charles Dicken's novel \\"A Tale of Two Cities.\\"<br /><br />The scale of an evil plot by the League of Shadows against Gotham City is so vast and complicated that fully two thirds of the movie is expended getting it on screen.  Bruce Wayne and Batman are reduced to a supporting role for long stretches, while the narrative focuses on an especially nasty villain named Bain, a police commissioner with a bad conscience, a cat burgler with more conscience than she can admit to, an ambitious but cowardly senior cop, a young cop with too much conscience, the violent mob that overruns Gotham, and the people who betray Gotham from within.<br /><br />The theme of the movie is redemption, especially but not only for Bruce Wayne.  Bruce and Batman will be humiliated, beaten nearly to death, and finally consigned to a place called Hell, before the story calls for his heroic return and even more heoric act of sacrifice.  It isn't pleasant to watch in places, but the ending should make it all worthwhile.  There are plenty of action sequences and lots of excellent special effects along the way.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway was probably not the obvious choice for Catwoman, but she can act.  She does an excellent job portraying the complex and conflicted cat burglar Selina Kyle, a woman in search of a clean start.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt almost steals the movie as the honest cop John Blake.  Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman reprise their roles from the earlier movies.  This reviewer wishes \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" had been a little shorter, but loved the ending; highly recommended.
B005K17RU0|5.0|very nice little app, easy to use and I like that you can have it give you a short little temp update every time you unlock the fire.
0553801473|4.0|I have read all 6 books and can say I really enjoyed them all. I wish some of the Bad people would go away as horrifically as the Good people. All that is left of the Starks is a criple and women who have no power. Cersie is still alive, Jamie is still alive and Theon is still alive and most of those bad people being killed, died not nearly as horribly as the good people. Most people believe that Good Triumps evil and some sacrifices must be made to root out bad but after spending a book developing a good character and have most of them go away is a travisty. I'm hoping someone will be remaining to fit the time period that rewards the Honor and goodness devoloped in many of the characters.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Fun game. I love it. There is something for everyone. Some of the games are quick and easy while others are very challenging. The half price weekends were a great idea.
B0086AYAQ6|5.0|I got this Cd, and as soon as I got it I listened to it. I've probably listened to it about 6 times today so far. Her Technique is flawless, and she has unmatched interpretations.  Valentina is at the top of my list for pianists.  The Program for this concert is incredible! The only complaint I have is that it isn't longer. She Includes Rachmaninoff Etude op.39 no.6, 3 of his preludes, 2 Scriabin Poems, La Campanella by Liszt, Un Sospiro by Liszt, Sonata no.14 in C# minor (Moonlight) by Beethoven, Liebestraum no.3 buy Liszt, Chopin nocturne in E Flat Major, Fur Elise By Beethoven, and much more! I would recommend this to anyone who loves classical piano.
0374203032|5.0|I'm already a big Sandel fan-- I liked Justice and The Case Against Perfection-- and WMCB is just as well-argued and persuasive as those two. Sandel's concern is that almost everything in American society is up for sale. He discusses a wide variety of practices and proposals he finds disturbing--\\"concierge\\" medicine, schools paying (bribing?) students to read books, payments for blood/kidney donation, lobbyists hiring poor people to stand in line for them, drug companies constantly advertising sexual performance enhancers,and many others.<br /><br />Sandel is very critical of the economic profession in WMCB. He thinks they have oversimplified the effects of financial incentives on people's behavior. He worries that financial incentives will lead to \\"crowding out\\" of more ethical reasons to do the right thing, or even produce the exact opposite result. One great example he uses is that of the Swedish town which first agreed to store nuclear waste nearby but then said no. Once hey were offered money in exchange for the deal. They considered it a bribe and were offended. Another great example he usesis that of the nursery that fined parents for piking up their kids late. What happened was the exact opposite of what ECO 101 would predict. There were more late pickups afterwards, as the fines apparently relieved the parents' guilt.
B0081L37Z0|1.0|The previews for this movie made it seem like it was going to be pretty funny, and, after reading so many positive reviews, I decided to watch it for myself. I was expecting it to be hilarious, and I kept waiting for the funny part, but it never came. It was vulgar, and it was definitely not necessary to drop the F-bomb every 20 seconds or less. This movie was a complete waste of 2 hours that I will never get back. I think I actually FELT my IQ dropping throughout the course of it. :(
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I loved this unique story!  Very imaginative and entertaining. There really aren't any other books to compare it to. I am quite picky about what I read, usually in the literary fiction realm, not fantasy. This one met my stringent criteria.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Having averaged 2-3 books per week for 50 years (you do the math), I can say that this is one of the best \\"Sword and Sorcery\\" stories I've read. The only disappointment I had was, 1/3 of the way through the book I went back online to get the next book in the trilogy and found it's still being written. I honestly did not want the book to end. The story details the brutal training the main character, Vaelin Al Sorna, undergoes starting as a young boy to become the most feared and respected warrior in the Sixth Order, a brotherhood tasked with defending the faith of the realm. Somehow, Vaelin reminds me of the characters Clint Eastwood played in his \\"Man with No Name\\",and \\"The Outlaw Josey Wales\\" westerns. Quite, honorable, possessed of a dry humor, and very, very, very deadly. The action is fast paced and unrelenting, just the way I like it. I've recommended this book to all my friends and family who are also voracious readers.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Overall good application. Nice interface and User input. Simple yet effective design.  Customs battery color makes everything right. Good product.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This movie is one of the best I've seen in a long time.  It honestly deals with a number of serious situations and makes you laugh (and cry).  It is a feast for the eyes and is the first movie I've ever seen about living in India that has made me actually want to go there.<br /><br />* I do think it is unfair that the UK edition comes with a digital copy and is already on the market.  I thought about buying it as we have a multi-region player but I want to share it with my mom who is in a rest home and she does NOT have a multi region player available so I'll wait and pay more yet get less.  What's up with that Amazon?
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I actually regret reading this book: I want my time back! Too bad I have a thing for finishing what I start. Maybe some part of me remained in denial and wanted it to get better. It didn't. I have so much respect for authors, and hope she doesn't take it personally. Just not my cup of tea.
B000JIHP88|5.0|My son loves this mobile. Loves it. As a newborn, it was the first toy he noticed and enjoyed. Eleven months later he still likes watching it go around; we just keep moving it higher to keep it out of reach. The charming, brightly colored animals actually face the baby below, which is surprisingly rare for a mobile. The music is fine, but can be too loud. Ideally there would be one quieter setting. However, the insect chirping sounds are pleasant and soothing. We use the mobile everyday before naps and bedtime and need to change the batteries about every three months. Also, while the crib attachment is easy to use, it is not adjustable to different sized crib rails.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I was sad that I had to give my ipod ( 2nd generation)  to my sister.  I know I know who cares about a stupid 2nd gener.  I said that too but I loved this game soo much. so when I found out its a kindle edition I was jumping for joy :D

Depends on what kind of things your interested in learning about, but there are those boring chapters. In the end, almost all the things talked about will be mentioned  again, so it all really comes together.

030758836X|1.0|Intriguing first few chapters in but then a yawner. It was easy to flip through pages at a time, skim and scan to get a gist of what the two self-absorbed characters were up to. I had to flip to the end in order to put the plot, characters and myself out of misery.
B000SEI230|5.0|After seeing the movie: A Walk To Remember I was very excited to read the book. I'm not going to write out the entire summary of the book, but I will tell you this: you should have a box of tissues nearby as you read this book  P.S I'm a 13 year girl
145162445X|3.0|A Universe from Nothing, A Hit and a Miss<br /><br />Lawrence Krauss's book A Universe from Nothing, presents a wealth of knowledge and a dearth of wisdom.  The book calls to mind the Chinese invasion of Tibet.  In To a Mountain in Tibet, writer Colin Thubron observes, \\"Where the Tibetans sense spirit the Chinese see superstition.\\"  In their invasion of Tibet, the Chinese sought not only to establish a new regime but also to eradicate a state of religious consciousness.  Tibet would come under the control of Chinese authority and Tibet would be swept clean of what the Chinese deemed messy and distasteful habits of mind.  Krauss's book has a similar dual purpose:  he intends to clarify our understanding of the universe, and he attempts to cleanse the world of the influence of philosophers and theologians.  With the righteousness of any rabid religious or political fundamentalist, Krauss boasts that \\"theology has made no contribution to knowledge in the past five hundred years at least\\" (144).  His writing about the physics of the universe is edifying, but his superficial assessment of non-materialistic thinking undermines the book's overall success.<br /><br />The book presents a clear and exciting review of the intellectual history of the fields of particle physics and cosmology that bear on the something-from-nothing mystery (Krause calls it a \\"conundrum\\").  Krauss's scientific narrative is compelling--a 4 star writing performance.  He is a fine storyteller.  His argument is convincing when the nothing he describes is empty space and when he claims that quantum theory allows for the emergence of matter from \\"the energy of empty space.\\" More speculatively, he suggests answers to the question of \\"a more fundamental nothingness from which empty space may have arisen, preexisted, and is eternal.\\"  His most plausible theory here is the multiverse, a condition without beginning or end or comprehensibility, a condition in which anything is possible except a god or a wisetheologian.  In short, he presents an explanation for existence not incompatible with the science of our day, but an existence not as mysterious, rich, or relevant as the one he wants to destroy for the rest of us.<br /><br />In his desire to eradicate the world of spirit Krause displays a disturbing lack of spiritual literacy.  He ignores the actual language of relevant theologians/philosophers/mystics; he also ignores any reports by ordinary folk with extraordinary nonmaterial experiences since, apparently, such considerations \\"muddy the waters.\\" (xvi)  He is not on speaking terms with the non-materialist culture he condemns.  Most of us, however, probably live partly in the world of the spirit, our own imaginative Tibet, where reports of the inspired, the mad, and the gifted are allowed to be taken seriously.  In this place we can entertain the possibilities of life beyond death as suggested by near-death experiences, as well as precognition, reincarnation, healings, miracles, prophetic dreams, mystical unions, and on and on.  We may attribute most of these reports to delusion or wishful thinking or fraud, but an open mind will find many of them enriching and convincing.  Krauss will have none of it.  He clearly needs to heed his own advice:  \\"A truly open mind means forcing our imagination to conform to the evidence of reality, and not vice versa, whether or not we like the implication.\\" (139). The traditions of religious, philosophical, and spiritual insights, as well as the lived experience of the common folk are evidence of a non-material reality that Krauss should not dismiss without a hearing.<br /><br />Moreover, when life pitches a knuckleball most of us don't turn to the pages of a Newton or a Dawkins or a Krauss.  When real trouble strikes, discoveries and theories about the material world do not sustain and instruct the soul.  At this fundamental level of struggling to understand the reality of the universe, we turn to the non-material wisdom of a Gandhi, a Buber, a Whitehead, a King, a Mother Teresa, a Bonhoeffer.  When Krauss proclaims that \\"philosophy and theology are ultimately incapable of addressing by themselves the truly fundamental questions that perplex us about our existence\\" (178), one can only wonder how someone so intelligent can be so narrow in his own philosophy.
1606995359|5.0|Volume 2 (actually, Volume 12, going by publisher order) of the Fantagraphics Carl Barks library reprints the first six issues of UNCLE $CROOGE: three FOUR COLOR features and U$ 4, 5, and 6.  These are the legendary tales and gags that transformed Scrooge McDuck from an intriguing supporting player in Barks' DONALD DUCK stories and \\"ten-pagers\\" into comicdom's great champion of high adventure and low (yet surprisingly amusing) cheapness.  There's no need for me to add to the piles of praise that have been justifiably heaped upon these efforts, except to note that Fantagraphics' production values easily live up to the high standards set in the first released volume of this series.  In this case, that even includes posing a stiff challenge to Duck fans' eyeballs and reproducing the exact same coloring schemes from the original Dell comics.  Did the color of Scrooge's broadcloth coat really travel the precipitous route from red-with-green-trim to green to plum to red to blue over such a short span of time -- sometimes changing from feature to feature within a single issue?  Did the Beagle Boys really have blue sweaters in \\"Only a Poor Old Man\\" before switching over to their trademark red/orange?  Yes, and FG faithfully depicts every single twist and turn.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed to see that George Lucas' foreword tribute to Barks is \\"merely\\" a reprint of the piece he wrote for the Celestial Arts book in the early 1980s.  C'mon, George... to cadge a metaphor from \\"Only a Poor Old Man,\\" a lot of water has crashed through the dam since then.  Don't you have any updated insights to provide to us, on the order of those you imparted to eager fans during your triumphant revisiting of the Star Wars \\"universe\\"?  (Or perhaps I should be careful what I wish for.)  The Story Notes continue to be quite good, though I can certainly see the point made by other reviewers who wish that the Notes for a particular story could precede that story.  It is a little awkward tohave to flip back to the rear of the book to read the Notes.  That being said, the Notes section also presents visual, as well as textual, information, such as story panels, covers, and, in the case of \\"Back to the Klondike,\\" some redrawn \\"lost\\" art (which is incorporated quite magnificently into the reconstructed original tale, I might add).  It is difficult to see how all of this could be broken up and presented on a story-by-story basis without making the job of reading even more confusing and wrecking what is presumably one of FG's aims, namely, to give the reader something as close to the original Dell-comic reading experience as possible.  Perhaps FG should consider putting a discreet footnote at the bottom of the title page of each story, indicating where the Notes for that story can be found in the back of the volume.  The purists may not like the move, but it may serve to satisfy more people.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is lots of fun! It's great for playing in church. :) I hope that the developers will release additional puzzles soon.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|This is by far the game responsible for me getting into serious board gaming. It's relatively easy to learn, has a good amount of strategy, but also a bit of luck. Build Settlements and Cities to produce goods for further growth; get rewarded for having the longest road and/or the largest army. This game is great for either casual or more serious gamers.<br /><br />PROS:<br />+ Players are encouraged to interact to trade goods, but it's not required to win the game.<br />+ If one player starts to dominate, the others can \\"gang up\\" to slow him or her down.<br />+ You can mix up the goods placement (tiles) for added variety, as well as buy expansions.<br />+ Experienced players can complete a game in less than an hour.<br />+ Can be played by the entire family.<br /><br />CONS:<br />+ Experienced strategic players will want to move on to more complex games.<br />+ The cardboard pieces and cards will wear out.<br /><br />Looking for a good game to get family and/or friends around the table, buy this!
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|i guess you do get what you pay for and since this was nothing thats what i got.  i have had other free apps and never had one crash on almost every game.
1451608659|5.0|This book is a must read for ALL child athletes & ALL youth coaches (ALL sports. Difficult to read at times but important nonetheless. Doms life behind the scenes was NOT as glamorous as the public once believed. She survived problems personal and professional that would kill a lesser person. I always admired Dom as an athlete but since reading her life story I've developed a respect for her as a person that few others have earned.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|at first I wasn'tg oing to know that this album existed, but then I saw Frank tweet on his tumblr that he'sg ay, and that's really neat and novel and it makes me feel progressive and enlightend if I like it so I really like it it's the best disposable pop R&B album of the years!!!!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game. Works great on the Xoom. No problems downloading, installing or playing the app. the game is very addicting.
B008MEM24S|4.0|This is a fun puzzle game trying to direct flowing stuff (water &amp; steam) to the target, just like Where's my Water.  but It has a different elements, like heat and cold rays to transform water to steam/ice.  Lots of achievements to go after once youve completed the levels, too.  Plus, if you're a Phineas and Fern fan, you'll find the artwork, animation, voices and humor to be spot-on.  I took off one star for it being short (only 4 sets of levels), and some of the levels were pretty busy.
B003E8P9G0|4.0|IT JUST WASN'T AS GOOD AS PERCY JACKSON!<br />Not that I hated it, 'cuz look at the stars, but look at Percy Jackson, and then look at this. Kinda one-sided, ain't it?
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love it, it's relaxing and when I'm bored at work it makes the time seam like its passing by
B007SYWFRM|5.0|well duh best app ever created by mankind. I really really really really really really really really really like it.
B003Z0BWT0|5.0|Where do I even start?  I guess first I should say, I friggin' loved this book!  I loved the first two books also but this was my favorite so far... They just keep getting better and better.<br /><br />I have been reading all 1st person point of view books as of late and I had forgotten how good a well written 3rd person point of view book can be.  It's just so enjoyable to read Cassandra Clare's writing style.  The whole book I felt I was on a roller coaster. Not the kind that makes you want to get off and throw up but the kind that makes you want to throw your hands up and yell at the top of your lungs, then you get off and want to do it all over again.<br /><br />You know those cliffhangers at the end of books that make you just sit there and stare at the final sentence for a few minutes? Well that is how I feel at the end of each one of these chapters.  With it being in 3rd person POV a chapter will end with a surprise or a important statement and then next thing you know you are in a different location with a different character.  This is why it is so hard to put down... you find yourself reading to the next chapter to get back to the other character only to find the current chapter ends in a way to push you even further to get back to it again.  It's a vicious and wonderful cycle and I wouldn't change it for anything.<br /><br />Always with reviews I hate saying too much about the specific events of the book as I hate when books are ruined for me... So I dislike doing it to other people.  I would strongly suggest this series to anybody. This has been a joy to read and I will immediately be starting the next book in the series.
B008MEM24S|3.0|yeah why can't it be free? I really want to play this app but I can't because I don't have any $.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|This tv series is one of the best I have seen given its content. I didn't expect it to be as good as it is. Great job to everyone who had a hand in putting together a show like this cant wait until next season!!!!!!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I like this app a lot!! It plays much better on a Fire or iPad. Not so good on a smart phone... too small for big fingers.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Great app i have it on my ipod and my kindle and i love it. sometimes the am stations on the real radio go out but this app keeps going and i don't miss part of my programs and i can record and listen later if i want.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is super super cool its really addictive even for people that aren't big fans of ice age is super well done and is really fun
B0063IH60K|4.0|If you like a quick solitaire game, this game's for you. It's well done. However, if you want variety of different games, this probably won't satisfy you.
B005LAII0I|1.0|What a disappointment and waste of talent! I expected a clever,enjoyable version of this classic fairy tale,but instead got a dry boring remake.
1603429999|5.0|Are you tired of knitting pieces of a bag, garment or hat and have to sew or weave the pieces together?  I know that I dreaded it until I started knitting with circular needles and joining the seams; well this book with teach you everything you need to know about switching out your straight needles for circular.  One of the advantages with circular knitting is that you never have to turn your work and purl if you are working in stockinet; this does not mean that you can't change stitches if you are doing a pattern. Color changing is simple and more precise.  This book is like having a teacher by your side helping you along the way.  This is an important book for any knitter and knit felter.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use this app a lot and really like it. It's very easy to use and hasn't let me down.
B004XGN8W4|4.0|The good :<br />. Go anywhere xbox360/ps3!<br />. Spacey inside, secure straps for console<br />. Loud speakers<br /><br />The not so good :<br />. No complaints so far<br /><br />Worth mentioning :<br />. The description for this product reads 720 as its native resolution but in reality it recognizes and works with 1080 just fine. Seems brighter in 1080 too.<br />. xbox360 owners will join me in doing a juggling game between where to put what cords when stowing away since we have the big brick on our power cord heh. Everything does fit though, no worries.<br /><br />Suggestions :<br />. There is a whole lot of real estate in this thing, could easily handle a larger screen. I'd suggest removing the curves from the case and fitting a 19incher in to the case heh. I'd buy it in a heartbeat :)
B002PEP4SC|5.0|If you watch Castle then you will really love this book. It was fun to follow guess right to the end who the offender was! It got into things I think Castle on the show would have enjoyed a lot sooner too. Totally neat! Loved it! Already reading the next one.
B003VANOFY|5.0|First of all I would like to address all of the one and two star reviews that I read before I purchased this product. Many of them complain about things not working, especially with Windows 7 64bit, however, none of these problems are an issue anymore. Many of the dates on those reviews are from 2009-2010 but Logitech as continued to release new drivers that fix issues. With that being said, do not even bother with the CD in the package as that drivers on that are completely outdated. The CD has version 1.0.xxx, while the latest driver can be downloaded from Logitech directly and at the time of this review is 8.30.86 (See link at end of review). A notably big difference from 1.0. Also disregard any reviews that claim the driver is no longer supported as the latest driver was posted on 06/05/2012.    Feature Review:    -G Keys: 3 Fully programmable G-Keys. The software gives them lots of functionality. Currently I have them setup with teamspeak. Some said this was not possible but it is simple to setup. Just go into teamspeak, go to shortcut keys and set a key combo. Then in the Logitech software set a G-Key to that key combo. Simple really.    -EQ: Nothing more you can ask for. There is a fully 10 channel graphic EQ as well as a simple two channel EQ. To access the graphic EQ click the \\">\\" on the right side of the two channel EQ at the bottom and then \\"Turn on The Advanced EQ.\\"    -7.1 Surround Sound: Works very well. As good as you can expect from a headset. Do note did exceed my expectations. When using the surround sound make sure you flip the switch on the back of the left ear that enables surround sound. I would recommend running the included 7.1 surround sound test.    -Voice Morphing: A novelty really but it works. I don't plan on using it but all the voice did work.    -Wireless Range: Better than I expected! Works through walls and in different rooms as advertised.    -Mic Sensitivity: INCREDIBLE. You will defiantly need to adjust the sensitivity in windowsand other apps that you use. The mic was able to record me whispering \\"1,2,3\\" as quietly as I could so it hears everything.    -Speakers and Noise Canceling: Works well. It does not block 100% of sound but nevertheless it is effective at blocking most sound and focusing your attention on what is playing on the headset.    Other Features I liked:  I love the volume control and mute buttons. The volume control is digital and actually controls windows volume which really impressed me and is a really useful feature. I also love the red LED on the mic boom that indicates if the mic is muted and in case anyone was wondering the mic does mute itself when it is placed in the upright position.    I was also very impressed with the cable management in the wired usb connector. The cable spins up tightly and locks into place (hard to explain but trust me it is very nice). Also the usb receiver plugs into this meaning you only plug in one usb to the back of your computer and you are set for charging and operation.    Good batery life and short(ish) charge time.    The packaging should win an award!    Cons:    -Did not come charged at all    -***The only problem I had with this device is when I was first trying to get it working I had one small problem. The driver was not working and none of the buttons on the headset did anything. If you have this problem where nothing seems to work (easy to know if you have this problem if the red mic mute LED is not coming on) just exit the driver software and turn off the headset. Then start the driver software and THEN turn on the headset. This worked for me. If this does not work for you try turning the headset off and then back on while the driver software is still running.    Overall:    A really wonderful product that I highly recommend!!!    Driver :[...]
B001J710Y8|5.0|There are certainly enough customer reviews of \\"The Wicker Man\\" that I don't feel any need to give a plot synopsis, but I think someone should mention that one of the great strengths of this tasty little tale of terror is its use of music. For a film in the horror genre, \\"The Wicker Man\\" comes very close to being an integrated musical, but does so with (largely) subtle wit and without undercutting the growing sense of menace which is quite a trick. The music credit for move goes to \\"Magnet\\" which may be an obscure celtic group which is capable of throwing in a little psychedelic guitar as needed or Magnet may be a collective name for some studio magicians and a few of the celtic musicians who appear on camera in the film; either way the music itself is catchy and evocative the region and the people it presents, but the way the music is incorporated produces an interesting hybrid, a film that is not quite a musical horror movie but something not far removed from that either. Take a look at the scene titled \\"Siren's Song\\" in the scenes index, which features Britt Ekland as a character named Willow singing and tapping on the wall of the room in which Edward Woodward's sexually repressed police sergeant is attempting to sleep and you certainly can't help but note how erotic the scene is but you may not stop to consider how odd it is to see a scene in a horror movie that would fit right into a film with Bob Fosse choreography. The second time you watch \\"The Wicker Man\\" (and if you watch it once the odds are very high that you will watch it again) take note of the abundance of singing and dancing and how well it is melded into the film.

0143039431|4.0|I admit I love Steinbeck. Fell in love with Of Mice and Men in high school (one of the few I actually read) and my all-time favorite book is East of Eden. So I kinda hoped this would be another love. I did like it, but it's a lot more depressing than anything I've read. It deals with real life, real emotions, and real poverty. You will definitely feel more empathetic to immigrants and the impoverished after reading it. I would certainly recommend this book and now know why it's a classic and required reading in many schools.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|i bought my kindle about a year ago and I've been snatching up anything i can get for free that sounds interesting. I'm so happy i decided to read wool, it is such and amazing story! Hugh Howey has definitely found a fan for life in me and I'm trying to turn others onto his work! i went ahead and bought all of his other stories and of what I've read so far i would recommend the next book you read of his be Half Way Home! I was so disappointed i didn't win the proof copy of this book and i didn't have the money to beat the $1500 price tag on the set he auctioned off for charity :(
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This was surprisingly suspenseful. I love Nicholas Sparks and once again he did not disappoint. Every time I thought I had the book figured out he took another turn and left me hanging. I had it read in two days.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is extremely fun. I recommend it to everyone.<br />Also it is challlenging, so if you like multiple games in one with some challenges this game is for you.
B007EC27QM|5.0|this is a great app so now I don't have go through the hours and look for a Cal or use my mind it is right there so I can use. :D 8*)
B007SGM084|5.0|Bought the trilogy bundle (via Amazon kindle) Fifty Shades, Fifty Shades of Grey and Fifty Shades Freed.  The author grabs your attention from the first page.  I didn't think I should buy this until someone told me she had to make a special trip to the bookstore  to get the second book (because the first book ends a cliff hanger 'this can't be the end' there has to be more).  The writing of this book took you into the lives of Anastasia & Christians & you are there - a fly on the wall.  As I read the last book,<br />'who is Christian' the writing is as 'Christian' narrates his story his way.  I would be interested is the thinking of Christian as he sees the story unfolds.  By the way, I am reading the trilogy for the 2nd time.
1582406723|5.0|bestest thing ever my grandma bought me and I really love it is good but the show is better. If you really like the show you will like the book.

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The story of the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is so intriguing I was compelled to read all three Millennium books. Reading just one or two books was like leaving the theater in the middle of a thrilling movie. I had to know the outcome of Lisbeth Salander's incredible struggle against very powerful and ruthless adversaries.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its kind of hard to get pet points if you don't want to spend real money but over all its a good game.

0316067601|5.0|I bought this book to read while on vacation. I could not put it down. Incredible 1st hand details on what it takes to be a SEAL and of their incredible courage. The men we lost in Operation Red Wing must never be forgotten. Our military is incredible and much of that is due to the incredible courage, strength, and intelligence of special individuals. I highly recommend this book
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game!  So much fun.  I love saving up my coins to get amazing bonuses and new players.
B007Q1VUFA|5.0|This album is very different from Robinson's previous two solo albums, both of which were outstanding.  Big Moon Ritual finds Robinson having fun playing with new people.  Clearly he is (and has been) influenced by the sonic adventurousness of the Grateful Dead; this is evident throughout BMR.  The tunes are loose and jammy; and though certain Black Crowes albums can be described in similar fashion--Amorica comes to mind--it's a different kind of loose and a different kind of jammy.  The songs are long and run through many different moods within them.  It's a conversation of sorts: the lyrics tell their story, then the guitars answer back, then the keyboards praise the whole blessed affair.  Standouts include \\"Tulsa Yesterday,\\" \\"Rosalee,\\" and \\"One Hundred Days of Rain.\\"
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game my three year old loves it I also like it but it easy easy for him to purchase things so I had to take my cards off my amazon account
0307716546|4.0|The new British thriller AFTERWARDS is told in a unique manner.  The narrator Grace addresses the book to her husband Mike while she is in a self-termed \\"cabbage\\" state of being brain dead though physically alive.  Grace received traumatic head injuries in a school fire that also critically burned her teenaged daughter Jenny.  Jenny is in a medically induced coma as a result of the severity of her injuries and will die unless a heart transplant match is quickly found.  According to the lore of the novel while in this comatose state Jenny and Grace can communicate with each other and leave their bodies to invisibly follow the actions of their living loved ones and others . This provides them the opportunity to gather clues in order to solve the mystery of who set the devastating fire that caused their injuries and for which their eight your old brother/son is being blamed.<br /><br />At almost four hundred pages AFTERWARDS is a tad long for a novel of psychological suspense and its length drags it momentum down especially in the closing chapters.  Author Rosamund Lupton does a good job of creating full characterizations of all her major players though some of the detail can be a bit confusing at times and there is probably at least one too many \\"red herrings\\" in the mystery plotline.  Still this is an above average thriller to be relished by fans of the genre.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this ap is one of the most usefull apps i have found. on my kindle fire it tells how long i can read a book for or play a game or listen to music or evem watch movies or tv shows for before my battery dies. props to the creator of this app for the useability it has id pay for this even
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I played it and was impressed;  they have a lot of games!  But the games cost a lot of points and it takes a while to get them.  It wasn't addictive but was a good play.
B0076R62FM|5.0|Johnny English has been 5 years in retirement in Tibet learning the ways of the master. He is called out of retirement for a mission to China to hunt down \\"Vortex\\" an assassination group out to kill the Chinese premier. There are 3 keys, or key parts that must be gathered together to have access to a secret weapon.<br /><br />The first good joke was the \\"Toshiba\\" sponsor sign for MI-7 secret services. The humor is more than just slapstick. Rowan Atkinson combines the sophistication and intellect of James Bond with the zaniness of Peter Sellers. Indeed, for those who loved Peter Sellers would also enjoy Atkinson who doesn't attempt to copy Sellers, but rather create a character in his own style reminiscent of the master. The early scene with the cat had me laughing out loud at the classic style of Atkinson.<br /><br />English is aided by agent Tucker (Daniel Kaluuya), a sidekick that has his own failings. Excellent use of the sound track. Worth seeing. Simply hilarious.<br /><br />Good family movie for the older kids. Imagine a good comedy without all that crude humor (okay it has some kicks to the groin).<br /><br />No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.

B005651R24|5.0|How can you not get hooked on the second paragraph of the first page of this book?<br /><br />Co-authored by my favorite YA authors of the past few years, John Green (Looking for Alaska) and David Levithan (Dash and Lily's Book of Dares), Will Grayson Will Grayson was always going to work, just a matter of how much. The characters and story make this book what it is--and very re-readable.<br /><br />Narrated from two points of view (the two Wills), in alternating voices to make it clear who's who, the story brings together Will 1 and Will 2 in an unlikely location which sparks a series of revelations and personal transformations that ultimately depend on a hugely lovable central character, Tiny Cooper, who depends on both Wills, himself. Themes of friendship, sacrifice, love, and homosexuality are handled with wonderful sensitivity and brilliantly crafted, hilarious, laugh-out-loud moments. I have re-read it three times and found myself alternating between preferring one or the other Will, written respectively by each author, depending on my mood.<br /><br />I had read Green's Alaska, Paper Towns and Abundance and was looking for more. Will Grayson was next and that opened the way for David Levithan and wooo yay. You should read it too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|These books are great!! I spent a lot of sleepless nights because i just couldn't put them down!! I usually won't read a book twice, but these I just might have to. They are worth every penny you spend (which isn't much)You won't regret reading this set of books..I guarantee!!
B005TVYVI2|1.0|In 12 weeks I've had two TT Pros fail & one of the clips break.  Shameful quality from the once reliable Finis!<br />After using the old TT (blue) for a couple of years I thought I'd spring for the new Pro model (yellow) with the strokes per minute mode.<br />The bracket/clip/holder for the first TT pro showed stress cracks within the first week (I took photos as the it was obvious the cracks would propagate and it would fracture in the near future) and after a few more weeks indeed the clip broke. I contacted Finis to point out the design fault and they eventually shipped me a new clip.<br />By the time the new clip arrived however the actual timer unit has ceased to function.  Tried new battery.  Nothing.<br />To keep training on schedule I ordered another immediately.  (Sometimes you get a lemon right?)<br />The new TT pro lasted 2 swim sessions (3 days) before failing to work properly.  It would beep only intermittently, switch itself off during a swim, when trying to adjust the tempo it would switch off, if set to more than 61 strokes per minute it locked up with a constantly audio tone and needed the battery removed in order to switch it off.  Useless.<br />Do NOT buy the TT Pro.  Finis should be ashamed.  Whoever is in charge of quality control for the TT pro should be sacked.
B0046M4H70|5.0|A very good story see it as an allegory to society then and now and how things change and still remain the same. This was very good on dvd much better on blu-ray. A great cast well produced and made.
0345803485|1.0|I hated this book. I hated myself for reading this book. I hated Ana. I hated Christian. Two of the most insipid characters ever to be found on the written page. Neither has any redeeming qualities. Could Ana be any more vapid, stupid, and repetitive? All this idiot ever does is ask herself moronic questions, flush, blush, turn crimson, and moon over a worthless dude, who has zero personality, bad manners and turns out to be abusive--not just kinky--abusive.<br /><br />Is it possible for Christian to be any more self-absorbed, creepy, condescending and weird? All he does is smirk smirk smirk--oh and manipulate hapless Ana. He should be slapped. But of course, HE is the slapper. What has this world come to when women believe the ideal man is a psycho creep like Christian?<br /><br />I'll admit I didn't read the entire book word for word. I ended up skimming through it because it was UNBEARABLE. By page 6, I wanted to rip my eyes out for reading the previous 5 pages.<br /><br />If you are interested in reading this book for the hot sex, don't bother. The sex is in this book is so mediocre. Even the kinky S&M bits are BORING. What a snooze fest. Really??? I don't get the hype.<br /><br />I'm sure the author is laughing her ass all the way to the bank because this book is so poorly written, I just know it couldn't have taken much effort to slap this crap together. Other reviews have already covered the repetitive words and phrases (OH MY, OH CRAP, JEEZ, INNER GODDESS, BLUSH, FLUSH........). Author, I implore you to buy a freakin' thesaurus.<br /><br />This is...in Ana's words: CRAP.

B008QE9XD2|5.0|I went into this film knowing that it was a Tim Burton film which cast Johnny Depp(my fave actor of all time) so I knew that it was going to be quirky. I mean come on, have you seen the old Batman movies?<br />I went to see this when it came out in theaters and love, love, loves it! I had even seen the older soap opera drama but it was great how Mr. Burton flipped it and made Johnny Depp absolutely unforgettable as Barnabus Collins! i can't wait until the DVD comes out so I can enjoy it over and over again...

B000AP04MO|5.0|I saw \\"Two for the Road\\" in a theater at Ford Ord, California in April 1967. The price of admission was 50 cents, double the usual 25-cent price, because it was a first-run feature. When a soldier making $90 a month faces a markup like that, it had better be a great film.<br /><br />In retrospect, it would have been worth today's $14 (or more) ticket price. Those 111 minutes have remained with me for 45 years.<br /><br />This film was the first I had ever seen with a non-linear narrative, and it was a different and fascinating experience to see how the film makers blended the various stages of the relationship between Joanna (Audrey Hepburn) and Mark (Albert Finney). I can just imagine the effort and time involved in film editing to create the clever transitions among a half-dozen time periods, employing dialogue, clothing and hair styles to seamlessly weave this story of a stormy-yet-passionate marriage.<br /><br />As the film neared its conclusion on that April evening, I wondered if anyone else in the theater was enjoying the film as much as I. After all, we were soldiers, mostly in our late teens or early 20s, perhaps more inclined to appreciate a \\"Beach Blanket Bingo\\" or \\"Dirty Dozen\\"-type movie than this sophisticated, stylish and complex film. But it appears \\"Two For The Road\\" struck a chord in every one in the audience. The entire theater broke into applause at the closing credits and everyone from my group of buddies talked about for days after the screening. It is a credit to director Stanley Donen, screenwriter Frederic Raphael and the cast, that this remarkable movie still remains one of my favorites.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I was recommended by a friend to read these books on a recent holiday. 'Oh my' is right! I had no idea what they were about and although I was reading them on my kindle, I think I blushed throughout all 3 books. Definitely an easy and engaging (yet pretty fluffy) read - perfect while on the beach! I have recommended them to my friends and now laugh at their reaction. Oh, and if you have not seen the Saturday Night Live spoof, you must see it on YouTube - it's so funny!
B004P1JEWU|4.0|This book is so frustrating, every time you get invested in a character some evil bugger knocks him off. If this keeps up there won't be anybody left by book 5. Mind you, it does keep you riveted to the plot.
B00846REIS|2.0|I couldn't help but compare this book to the '50 Shades of Grey' story line. 'Bared to You' was just more crude but the story line is the same - hot millionare who meets young girl and wants her at first glance but he has baggage, he gets the girl, they have sex (lots and lots of sex), blah, blah, blah. Let me guess what happens in the next book...they end up getting married, having babies and live happily ever after? I definitely preferred the writing style of 50 Shades over this one and I plead to the author - please be original and don't ride the coat tails of another popular book!!
B005CMSDLE|5.0|If you like watching a robust female being able to kick a**, watch Hanna!<br /><br />Hanna's the female version of the male \\"Universal Soldier\\" prototype with attributes of Nikita. During the first 15 minutes of the movie, I was wondering when any action was going start. But, once the action starts, it never did stop! I was totally glued to the set! Most scenes were fast paced and action oriented - the way I like an action movie to turn out. The screen shots were mostly well directed with clear angles.<br /><br />Bloopers in the movie:<br /><br />(1) the fight scene with the skinhead at the container docks where I didn't detect fake blood being used.<br /><br />(2) the scene where her host family was held hostage with no follow-up news of them at the end of the movie.<br /><br />(3) At least 1 primary bad guy wasn't killed in the end - that evil blonde man.<br /><br />Is there going to be a sequel to this movie?

B000F1IQMS|4.0|Director Steven Spielberg (a Liberal, secular Jew?) is too kind in his portrayals of the Muslim terrorists in this blockbuster movie! He tries to portray them as just politicos with a cause - albeit one that tries to overthrow the state of Israel through ruthless and mindless terrorism! (1 star rating deducted for this point.)<br /><br />I've giving an above average 4 star rating for this movie because it has non-stop action and satisfying wide-angle graphics. I like action movies with a message.<br /><br />This movie is action packed from start to finish and shows the seemingly endless cycle of violence in Middle Eastern politics. The Mossad's actions were thoroughly justified in reaction the injustices that the underdog, Israel, faces. With the rise of evil Liberalism, Germany had swung from one extreme to another, from Nazism in the 1930s and 1940s to a paralyzed, Liberal state without a proper anti-terror force in the year 1972. When Germany couldn't and and wouldn't save those innocent Israeli athletes, Israel had no choice but to do its rightful part in avenging their deaths. This movie takes a peek at how Israel defends herself beyond her borders.<br /><br />If you want to see how brave Mossad operatives hunt down and take out those who murder innocent Israeli civilians, buy and watch this movie, then go join Mossad and Shin Bet (Israel's version of the MI5)! But, don't join if you're going to be doubtful and hesitant in your work.<br /><br />I also want to take this space to thank all those earlier reviewers who recommended \\"Sword of Gideon\\"! Both movies reminiscing the Israeli response will go into my library collection!<br /><br />Recommended viewing:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0002IQIH4 Sword of Gideon]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000F5GJSW Sword of Gideon]]<br /><br />Recommended reading:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007BWG0I6 Every Spy a Prince: The Complete History of Israel's Intelligence Community]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0743291646 Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team]]Terrorist Team]]

This book is the most insightful thing written about Steve Jobs that I have ever read. You get the good, the bad, and the unknown. What I mean is there is so much I did not know about Steve Jobs before reading this book and now I do thanks to the way this book uncovers the really important details. This is by far one of my favorite biographies.

B008BDZP3K|4.0|This sounds EXACTLY like the vinyl version I obtained several years ago. If you believed that the original CD reissues (containing Zappa's remix) did not do the album justice, then please, pick this up. I am one of those folks who are used to the original CD version (I didn't grow up in the 60s and the 70s unfortunately), so it is still kind of strange listening to the original 1969 mix (even though I own the vinyl version). Still, there is a greater degree of warmth here, and you can't go wrong with it either ways. Finally, it seems like the Zappa Family Trust is giving the fans more of what they want!

B007N31ZS8|2.0|High Plains Drifter is a great movie - 4 or 5 stars all the way. I already have a DVD copy. Why would I purchase another? As this is Universal's 100th anniversary, one would think the studio would have gone all out for a blu ray version.<br />Thus 2 stars for impudence!
B001H5X7I4|5.0|Tropic Thunder has a strong impact on most viewers,and for me, it goes straight to the funny bone!  Whenever I watch it, it always gets me laughing.  I don't think a lot of people realize that it is supposed to be a satire, poking fun at just about everything and everyone that comes into the cross-hairs, (especially the movie industry), but not in a mean-spirited way. Many reviewers have already addressed the movie in great detail, however, I'll just add my two cents about the theatrical vs. director's cut versions.  I personally much prefer the director's cut, but either version is great.  I just think the extra scenes (13 minutes worth) add several more funny moments.  Just be careful when you order the DVD to check the run time on whatever version you purchase, as the director's cut is around 120 minutes, and the theater version around 107 minutes. (Sometimes they use the reviews interchangeably, so you can't always go by the comments.) That way you will end up with the version you choose.

0385534639|5.0|For fans of the fantastique, A NIGHT CIRCUS, which recalls Ray Bradbury's dark fiction, is a promising debut. An accomplished cartoonist in her own right -- judging from her Tarot card designs -- Erin Morgenstern delivers the goods in her first novel. It recalls Ray Bradbury, obviously, and also Tom Reamy's little-known first (and only) novel, BLIND VOICES, but Eric's writing style merges the two: We get Bradbury's imagery and Tom Reamy's love story set against the backdrop of big tents, which conceal more than they reveal.<br /><br />Those of us in the book trade are likely familiar with the book's history: After submitting it to dozens of literary agents, who turned it down, she eventually found an agent who saw the magic in the book and repped it to Doubleday, which published it as a beautiful, enchantingly designed hardback. (Not surprisingly, it has already been option by Hollywood for a major motion picture.)<br /><br />Pouring new wine from old bottles, Erin's enchanting story pits two magicians whose apprentices fight on their behalf. The two -- one male, one female -- fall in love. (And, yes, the hyperbolic, breathless ad copy from the publisher promises us it's a \\"mesmerizing love story for the ages.\\" Well, that's a bit overblown. The real magic here is not the love story but the magical and imaginative elements, which recall Susanna Clarke's JONATHAN STRANGE AND MR. NORRELL.<br /><br />I missed this from the Amazon Vine Program, and missed it at the Book Expo where Eric was signing copies at the Doubleday booth -- the waiting lines were too long -- so I got the hardback from Amazon. It was money well spent. Erin has carefully and lovingly taken us into her world where we walk in amazement, marveling at her imaginative constructs: I will not soon forget the \\"book\\" ship that sails the sea of ink.<br /><br />Bottom line: For a first novel, I'd rate this as a \\"B+\\" and, as such, is well worth your attention. It's a strong debut from a young writer, and I eagerly look forward to her second book, and her third, and her fourth....ly look forward to her second book, and her third, and her fourth....
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I have finished my first build of a computer.  In reading reviews, reviewers stated that the cooling on my new CPU, Intel 3770K, could be better than what came with the CPU. In going over reviews for coolers, most reviews recommended the Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO.  Those same reviews recommended the Arctic Silver 5 Thermal Compound in lieu of what was supplied by either Intel or Cooler Master.  I did in fact purchase both items from Amazon as recommended by reviewers.  Prior to applying the paste I was concerned about spreading the compound evenly over the CPU.  This concern was in the end not warranted.  One reviewer stated that he used a business card to spread the paste evenly over the CPU.  The paste was just the right viscosity and it spread very evenly over the CPU, it could not have been easier.  I wish to thank you reviewers and Arctic Silver for helping make my first computer build a success!
0143039881|5.0|Before we got to know her as a philosopher, or as a legal and an academic scholar, Hanna Arendt was a journalist for the New Yorker magazine. It was in this capacity as an eye witness to the trial that she accumulated material for this book, which first appeared as a series of articles in that magazine a year or so after the trial.<br /><br />As usual, Professor Arendt's supple mind and precise writings are on exquisite display here. In her other roles, she is well known for not suffering fools lightly, and here too she does not stoop or even give a nod or a hint to political correctness, or cheap but anticipated ethnic pandering. Apparently trying to maintain her high standards of scholarship is what got her in trouble regarding certain aspects of this book. Yet, despite the hoopla, in my view, she remains the \\"real deal,\\" raising our IQs as she teaches us how to think correctly about complex, sensitive and raw emotional issues like race, ethnicity, anti-Semitism and the kidnapping and the trial of Adolph Eichmann, all issues that I thought I already knew all there was to know?<br /><br />During 1961, Eichmann's capture and kidnapping from a suburb near Sao Paulo, Brazil was a sensation. We all predicted the script of the trial: that Eichmann would quickly be found guilt and hanged.  And although that was indeed exactly how it turned out, it takes the acute eye and a mind like that of Dr. Arendt to give us all of the textured and nuanced layers that do not meet the casual and legally untrained eye. That is where the richness of this book shines through.  Every reader must be grateful to her for pointing out all the non-obvious aspects of what we all saw as a cut-and-dried trial.<br /><br />For instance, it never occurred to me at the time (or even later), that Prime Minister Ben-Gurion, the architect of Israeli statehood, was also the director of the stage play that would become the Eichmann trial. The trial was clearly Israeli Kabuki theater but also it was globaltheater too. According to the author, one would not have been incorrect to see the trial as Mr. Ben-Gurion's own personally orchestrated \\"show trial.\\" Ben-Gurion after all believed that sitting in judgment of Eichmann was the business of Jews alone since Eichmann was an enemy of the Jewish people.<br /><br />Under Ben-Gurion's theatrical directorship, the trial thus was turned into a pure \\"show trial,\\" a symbolic and didactic exercise, a forum for teaching Israelis that Israel remained the only true safe-haven for them from an anti-Semitic world gone mad; for teaching Christians that Eichmann, the ovens, and the gas chambers were the logical end points of 1500 years of Christian directed hatred towards the Jews; to teach the world about Jewish history and about the continuous suffering of the Jewish people; and finally the trial was a drama about the perpetrators, the Nazis. It gave them names and addresses and shamed the culture from which they came, just as it catalogued what they did, to whom they had done it, why they did it, and how they had done it. In short, Eichmann became the \\"stand-in\\" for all of the monsters that Nazis and Christian culture had produced.<br /><br />Yet, Ben-Gurion's agenda was not even half the story of the meaning of the Eichmann trial. In addition to Ben-Gurion's agenda, Eichmann's trial was also about a host of other important issues -- things that only a mind like Dr. Arendt's could conger up, uncover and then explain. Here is a short list of them to end this review:<br /><br />First, Eichmann was on trial for his murderous deeds only -- for which the prosecution could not produce a single witness who saw Eichmann kill anyone? The best they could produce is a hearsay conversation in which Eichmann was supposed to have suggested in a coded way, having certain people killed. He was not on trial for the suffering of the Jewish people. He was not even on trial for his anti-Semitism or racist views. For if he had been, then the Israeli state, one of the world's only race-based states, would also have to answer for having Nazi-like laws against mixed marriages, and its way of declaring all mixed-race babies as bastards, etc.<br /><br />Second, as this last point makes clear, whether it wanted to be or not, the Israeli state, its ways of justice, its culture, and even its way of life were also on trial. In fact it was in this area where the author, a Jew herself, got into big trouble. She correctly insinuates that \\"show trials\\" are usually not about justice but are about larger political issues beyond the courtroom. While the Israeli court that hanged Eichmann failed to show that he had personally killed anyone, it did prove what Eichmann had readily admitted to: that he was but a cog in a cultural and bureaucratic wheel whose hub was Nazism, which revolved around anti-Semitism and a vast machinery of death.<br /><br />But being true to the racist social order in which he found himself did not make Eichmann a criminal in the eyes of the German laws he was duty bound to obey and uphold. Indeed he was a murderer for the state in the same that an ordinary soldier is. Is this not true of patriots in most countries, including the USA? Because of his role as a German patriot, Eichmann's conscience was no more troubled when he killed Jews than when any soldier's is who kills a perceived enemy of his state? Nor did he violate any known German laws by following Hitler's directives, directives which had the same status and effect as law.<br /><br />It is in this vast area of the morality of cultures, the morality of state laws, and the morality of people under extreme duress within them that Dr. Arendt earns her pay. She raises and then tries to answer two forbidden holocaust questions, both of which got her into trouble with Jews. The first one was: \\"Why did Jews go meekly to the gas chambers without protest, even when it was obvious that there were times when they could have easily overpowered the guards? (whom they always outnumbered, and as eventually happened at Sobibor)<br /><br />Her two-part answer was the best I have heard so far: The first part is profound and with the unmistakable ring of truth. As she puts it: \\"the triumph of the SS, demands that the tortured victim allow himself to be led to the noose without protesting, that he renounce and abandon himself to the point of ceasing to affirm his identity.\\" The second part of the answer is equally profound and even more succinct: It is that there are some punishments much worse than death itself and all them were held in abeyance: reserved for Jews collectively in the event of uprisings and rebellions.<br /><br />The second question had to do with the morality of the Judenrate, Jews who ran the ghettos for the Nazis and thus who collaborated with them, selecting and sending many of their own Jewish neighbors to be gassed -- ostensibly so as to be able to either save others or delay their execution. As I understand her argument in this instance, there comes a time when humans under extreme stress and duress, that see morality as an abstraction, must give way to the reality staring them in the face? The author argues that this was the case for the Judenrate whose very existence was balanced on a slender thread of Nazi capriciousness. Their decisions were not ones made strictly on the basis of abstract moral principles alone, that is to say, only on the abstract moral plane, but were made on the plane of individual pragmatism, on their own  \\"Realpolitik\\" of the moment.<br /><br />The upshot of the book is that Eichmann was neither especially evil or immoral but a colorless vanilla cog in the wheel of a bureaucracy based on racial superiority mass murder and genocide. And as we have seen, such governments did not whither away with the defeat of the Nazis: they still stalk the post-modern world. Five Stars

B002GHHHIS|4.0|If you approach this thinking anyone meant it to be taken seriously you'll be deeply disappointed. It's meant to be a kind of spoof of the semi-rogue cop action flicks, and the chemistry and banter between Stallone and Russell is terrific. Teri Hatcher ... well, it's obvious someone thought she was pretty, which she is, but her acting is appalling at best. She inescapably brings to mind \\"Who did she sleep with to get this role?\\" The other roles are ably performed; Geoffrey Lewis is particularly fun as Stallone's boss. This is a fun flick, not a serious flick. Come on, folks.

B005QUQP76|5.0|I love these mice. from the woven cord cover to the variable speed button.<br /><br />  I used to buy the Logitech MX 400 laser mouse exclusively, but they are getting hard to find for some reason. So I bought a few of these as a trial replacement mouse. (I'm picky about mice since I work at a computer all day)<br /><br />  I also still prefer a mouse with a cord. We do a lot of 3d work and it seems every time there is an important client meeting is when the cordless mouse went dead. good times... good times...<br /><br />  So I am a computer jockey many days for 12 hours or more a day, so I also look for ergonomic mice. This fits that bill very well.<br /><br />  The only thing I didn't like very much was that the middle mouse button/wheel is difficult to push down relative to other mice.<br /><br />  With that being said, if you but one of these I think you will be very pleased.<br /><br />  Thanks for your time.

The album is a collection of happy beats, with some falsettos (as usual), weird noises; so it's pretty much a feel-good album. I think after all, this band is the definition of indie pop. They balance right the pop influences, but after all, you can see also a little bit of indie too.<br />If you loved \\"Manners\\", \\"Gossamer\\" is the album for you. One of the best albums of 2012 so far, I can see it winning some Grammys.

B00000K0T8|5.0|Wu tang were really running hip hop in the 90s from 93 to 97. This was all apart of the 5 year plan RZA spoke of in his manuel where they would rule hip hop for 5 straigt years & they surely did just that. Tical. Return To The 36 Chambers, Liquid Swords, & OB4CL were all classic solo wu albums but I think Ironman was is my favorite 1 with Liquid swords & OB4CL being not far behind. Ironman was the last of the solo wu album during the vintage era. Ghostface came with some fire on here. alot of people refer to this album as sort of a part 2 to OB4CL & in a way it is. This time raekwon & cappadonna are the quote on quote co host here like ghost was for raekwon on cuban linx. Ghostface pretty much explores the same theme here as on cuban linx drugs, crime, 5% teachings, women, all wrapped up in 1 big movie. You can also see the obsession Ghostface had with wallabees from the look of the album cover (makes me wanna cop some myself LOL) which happens to be 1 of my favorite albums covers of all time. This whole album is classic but the standout tracks for me are \\"Faster Blade\\", \\"Assasination Day\\", \\"Poisonous Darts\\", \\"Box in Hand\\" \\"Winter Warz\\" (Cappadonna tears this track apart), \\"Fish\\", \\"Black Jesus\\", \\"Daytona 500\\" (shows just how creative wu tang are they also had a video for this featuring the speed racer cartoon LOL the song also samples the classic Natilus from Bob James), \\"After The smoke Is Clear\\", \\"All I got Is You\\" & \\"The Soul Controller\\" (A track that was only on the early release of the album but was taken off latter releases due to copyright issues). If you're a WU fan or a fan of real authenic hip hop in general I highly suggest you pick this up if you don't own it already & rememeber folks Wu Tang is forever suuuuuuuuuuuuu!
B004AUGJS8|1.0|Ryan Gosling just stands there. A turnip could play his part. Dunst is, as always, beautiful but has a rough time playing off the stone gosling. The only saving grace is that they know how to get the most out of Dunst's lovely face and to die for body. Once she disappears at about the 60 minute mark turn it off. It's down hill from there.
0316098329|3.0|If you feel like being a five year old boy for a couple days or hours, then pick up this book. You'll find yourself in the mind of an especially articulate child who is very happy in his own world, but whose fifth year changes everything. Sounds good to you?<br /><br />There's a catch--there always is--because he's locked in a room with his mother and there's a whole another world outside the locked door.<br /><br />The book was published in 2010 and it won't take you long to come up with a handful of possible sources for its inspiration, unfortunately. And yet, Donoghue manages to turn it into a charming tale of survival, adventure, and new beginnings.<br /><br />Objectively, this a very well written book. Jack's voice is pitch perfect for someone his age and somewhat extraordinary circumstances. There's a clear structure to the book, and there's humour as well as candid observations.<br /><br />I could wax poetic of the literary values of this book, but the truth is all that didn't stop me from being bored out of my skull. There were moments towards the end when Jack's boyish enthusiasm got the best of him and actually made reading Room interesting, but those were only moments.<br /><br />I'm not Dr. Clay wanting to take an advantage of subject psychological article series--I'm Steppa, the outsider who lets things and people be what they are rarely wanting to intervene and who retreats to his own space to ponder on things larger than life. Like chocolate.<br /><br />It's a good book, you should read it. Objectively speaking.
B00005JL78|3.0|But I'd suggest the police station disable the security clearance of suspects. No less than three times Tom Cruise (and his wife) were able to get into the most sensitive areas of the police station using his eye balls. In the remake that will follow in the next ten years, I'd recommend closing this plot hole by having the protagonist use acrobatics to enter the police station. Include laser trip lines and pressure-sensitive floors without discretion.
B00846WWVM|5.0|I started this game in Best Buy on the iphone demo. I liked it so I decided to buy it. works well on the kindle fire. But it needs more levels.
B001BRAUYM|5.0|This is a multi tiered, multi character movie that has plenty of surprises. Very good acting and a very good story line. It moves quickly and is one of the best. This is a serious movie for those who want it real. The basic story line in short is a space ship crashes on a outpost that has been destroyed by creatures straight out of \\"Aliens\\", they only come out at night due to the light causing them great pain, the good news is the sun is shinning when they crash the bad news is the sun is setting for a very long time shortly thereafter.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I like the game I play on it sometimes. I like the computer version better. but this is a great game very fun to play. it is worth the price
B0058YPLA2|5.0|This is one of the best new shows on television. I can't wait to purchase the first season, re-watch all the episodes, and prepare for the second season. It is such a breath of fresh air. No profanity, excessive violence, lewd behavior, etc... I'm not saying that I don't watch shows that have sex, profanity, etc... but it is nice to have a true escape. I love that it also actually makes \\"being good\\" admirable (although the evil queen is a delectable character!). This is such a great show with such an awesome cast and storyline! If you haven't watched it, and love the storytales from your youth, WATCH THIS SHOW ASAP! Love love love love this show!
B0086700CM|5.0|This is an epic game. Whoever doesnt get it is missing out and maybe blind to see the awesomeness. Now I am not criticizing anyone, but if you ask me, GET IT!!!
B0016BP0PW|5.0|A fascinating and visually stunning look into the 60s through a handful of characters. Music is excellent, sets are wonderful, editing is spectacular.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is a really great app. Very similar to &quot;Where's My Water&quot;, but it has its own twists as well. Lots of fun!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I tested the accuracy of the app by timing how long I could play a 3d game. it said around 29 minutes and when the time hit 29 minutes my kindle shut down.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|There are a few glitches in the system that is causing it to move very slowly and freeze up; secondly. I would love it if were given more information,on how we could earn more free purchase credits. Maybe that information is already provided to us,, unfortunately I have yet ti really understand how the game works ....is it suppose to work like Roller Coster Tycoons? Anyways it is fun to play and similar to all things in life it has some improvements that could made.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this is by far the best game i have.  it is extremely fun and really addicting.  you don't need to buy anything just to do good in the game.  I really love it and recommend it to all
0470474874|4.0|Like the title says, this is a good book for beginning or intermediate use. The later sections are limited in how detailed it goes -- which is expected. The content is exhaustive and covers most every topic. Definitely worth the purchase if you're completely foreign to Excel or if you're looking for a mostly complete reference book.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. I will not be accepting any more updates on the angry birds games until you can do it without deleting the game and all my progress.  this doesn't happen on itunes, should't happen on Amazon. watch out, Angry Birds Fans! the update will eat your scores!
B002YVAT72|5.0|This turntable is great! Burning vinyl to iTunes is the easiest process ever. The sound is as good as you'd expect from vinyl; while it cant improve the sound of your old vinyl it sounds just as good as it did on your high school turntable! Extrememly happy with the value of this purchase.
B000002KDX|5.0|I originally bought this album (vinyl) back in the '70's, and I've been hooked on America ever since!  I also had an 8 track of their Holiday album.  Does anyone remember 8 tracks?<br /><br />At any rate, it was time to replace the vinyl with a shiny new CD. After listening the first time, I wonder why I didn't buy the CD a long time ago!<br /><br />I'm sure most people are familiar with \\"Horse with no name\\", \\"Riverside\\", \\"I need you\\", and \\"Sandman\\", but my favorite America tune is \\"Three Roses\\", which is also on this CD.  It's quite simply just great acoustic guitar. Another favorite is \\"Here\\", also on this CD.<br /><br />This is the album that launched their career in the music biz, and it still sounds fantastic today!
B00006J9OT|3.0|Bought this because I was buy up cd in this genere. A little up beat for my taste but still good. Her skill is obvious, I dont know if the songs and voice is exactly what I expected. I would accept this gladly as a gift.
B008A1B5Z0|5.0|I have the kindle fire and it has saved me from crashes and helped with the everyday use by now slowing it down. It's a must have to me, easy to use and gets the job done.........great app!
0316286850|4.0|I bought this for my wife after some discussion about make up and how she applies her. We both found it interesting, I think it provides fundamentals about why and how you do apply make up and what the overal purpose and reaons why you would apply it. I think it's a good book. Sad to hear about about Kevin doing some online research. Interested to get his other books.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|If you want to know the most basics of how long your battery lasts, its a good app to have.

0345803485|5.0|I guess I'm 'kinkier' than I thought. I'm into the second book, I loved the first one, and couldn't put it down. The authoress was able to put in words, what movies have done with sight.....only better. She sure has a creative way of writing, and the chapters are not repetitious, but fresh.<br />Who wouldn't want Christian in their life. I think it would be exciting.Money, brains, looks and he's so in love with Ana. Too bad many will not embrace this Trilogy in their lives.<br />But I have a friend, whose husband was shocked at movies when they dated, so she threw out all her other 'goodies' knowing he was not into it.....sad!!!
B008133DO8|5.0|I've read, watch and enjoyed almost every story, movie, (even silent offerings) for over 57 years of Sherlock Holmes & Dr. Watson!!  Big Thank U for having Season 2!!  Yes, I thought at first this was going to be a cheesy production of silly actors....\\"WRONG\\"!!  Absolutely Brilliant on all accounts, can't wait for Season 3 and beyond!!  Take it from a retired forensic criminal med-tech, this series is not a mutated specimen!! Nuff' said.
B008IJTFYW|1.0|I didn't like it at all and you can't do much with it. I guess you can't complain because it's free but there are other ones that are free and you get the whole application and they are great.
B00785P2QC|5.0|best one ever . if u like games that involve buying things you'll like this one. I play it every day but there's a lot of problems that happen at a higher level
1451627297|3.0|The book is not bad. Interesting plot. But toooooo long. I could happly do without that Sadie part. How can a be woman that boring? The secondary plots, like balls, plays, watching fights only made the book boring and slowed down the pace. When it came to the final goal, I had already lost my interest in the story, after all those cheap romance stuff and good samaritan behaviour. I thought it was going to be much better. I was disapponted in the end.
B005FITIF0|5.0|Some people say that Sam combat evil with evil and only see your hipocrisy sense moral. This movie present the real Africa, for God, Only critical to the man. Please Mr. Confort is time for help. This is the real message, not critical to Sam and your Way. Don't see the childrens!!<br />Mr. World Perfect maybe you live in the WonderLand... Wake Up Stupid Mr World Perfect and your stupid people puritan, the language is problem.. ohhh.. total going of the reality!
B004LROUW2|2.0|The book is very well written and the translator did a wonderful job.  But that's all.<br /><br />The plot, at least in the beginning, was interesting enough to make turn page after page eagerly. But then what was interesting and originai became absurd and very boring.<br /><br />But then the never ending descriptions, like which exact clothes every single caracther was wearing in absolutely every scene, or how every single room was decorated, the endless times the author mentioned the breasts shape or how fit the main caracther was,  made put the book down. When part three begun, I had to force myself to read it in order to finish.<br /><br />As it has already happened in other books, I got the feeling the author wanted to strech the story as much as possbile to make a big book. It doesnt work because it only makes the reader lose interest.<br /><br />I read some reviews mentioning other books by the same author but honestly, I haven't dared yet, with fear I will be thatbored again.

B006VKKAWQ|4.0|I am not a big fan of Arturo Toscanini (certainly not an unconditional admirer), but as man and musician he was undeniably important. Apart from his importance in terms of influence and popularity, he did set some standards that are worth maintaining. His fixation on precision could get wearisome, but orchestral standards have risen, partly due to him, partly for many other reasons. There is an high enough proportion of great, fine, or interesting recorded performances in Toscanini`s output to make having a complete set of his R.C.A. Victor studio recordings, available together in a single package like this one, a most desirable acquisition for one`s collection.<br /><br />Most of all, however, Toscanini`s greatness, for me, lies in how superbly well he conducted and interpreted the repertory of composers for whom he had the most affinity. First of all, LUIGI CHERUBINI. Toscanini did much to kick-start the revival of interest in Cherubini`s music that, fortunately, has continued. Toscanini`s recordings, however, do suffer from the sound in which they were captured. Cherubini`s music is beautifully orchestrated, so the potential charm of hearing such fine interpretations of Cherubini`s lone symphony and of the overtures to his operas which Toscanini chose to record (and to conduct publicly frequently in his concerts and broadcasts) is limited by the pale sound, which does so much to undermine these recordings. As for the great Requiem in C Minor, the choral-orchestral balances are even more damaging, the cunningly orchestrated accompaniment at times all but inaudible when the chorus is singing (that is, most of the time). Nonethess, Toscanini was a giant in this repertory!<br /><br />For me, the other composers whose music Toscanini best conducted were, above all, Wagner (wonderfully vigourous and enlivening!), Berlioz, Verdi (toweringly great) and numerous other Italians (e.g., Cimarosa, Rossini, Boito, Wolf-Ferrari, Puccini, Catalani, Respighi, et alia), who music he directed exceedingly well. As for the Viennese classics, although Toscanini, intermittently, made some truly wonderful recordings of certain of Beethoven`s symphonies (nos. 3, 7, and 9), of the overtures, and of other works (instrumental or vocal), too many of his performances of this sublime composer are just too hectic to do Beethoven`s music justice. Then there are the other Viennese masters, i.e. Haydn, Mozart, and Schubert, and Toscanini`s way with their music is, variously, just too brutal, uncomprehending, or just plain botched to take seriously. Of course, for that other towering figure active in Vienna later in the 19th century, Brahms, Toscanini did very well, indeed.<br /><br />The above is generalising, and there are many other individual composers and performances among Toscanini`s output of studio recordings that deserve some mention (conducting the music of Gluck, Schumann, Elgar, Richard Strauss, and of many other composers), but I am not enough of an advocate for this conductor to take the effort and space to go on at length to deal with them. There are some more exhaustive reviews on Amazon, especially on Amazon`s U. S. of A. WWW site, for those who desire such a level of discussion of this compendious release. Nor do I care to go into detail regarding the various permutations, analogue and digital, of Toscanini reisuues, though I would say that the various segments of the B.M.G. Classics numbered series, \\"Arturo Toscanini, the Immortal\\", is about as good as I have heard among the various CD reissues of his output, albeit purchasing some of these other reëngineered complete CD editions can cost  considerably more than the one under review here. Toscanini`s way with music, at its best, is so superb that it is worth having a comprehensive set such this one, even if it means that some of the individual CDs within it may get little play, at least \\"chez moi\\".<br /><br />Acquire this, if you can!he directed exceedingly well.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great App to monitor your battery life. It brakes down usages for each program you are running and counts down the time until your next recharge time.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is totally ADDICTING! I would recommend it to everyone... young or old. It makes you think. Get this&hellip; you wont regret it!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Very cute. The music is a little irritating but the gameplay is fun and easy use. Graphics are nice too, especially for a free app.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Fantastic app! It does everything I need it to. All my Microsoft Word, Excel, and Power Point documents can be created, changed, or corrected right from my tablet.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I downloaded this the day after I had really bad insomnia and checked it out that night.  The sounds are very soothing and it really helped me to sleep.  I love how you can combine sounds to make it unique and fit your own tastes.  This is a must have for anyone who has trouble falling asleep.
B00846REIS|5.0|I was shocked to find out the baseline of their issue's. I honestly wouldn't have bought this title if I had been well informed, however I couldn't put it down after I started reading it! They both need help to overcome past difficulities to make them both stronger together and Independently. They are good for each other and disturbingly unhealthy for each other at the same time. Its a really good read, one I truely enjoyed in the end and can't wait for book two this fall.
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is fun to play.  It is one of my favorite games to play.  I would recommend this game to anyone.

B006BDHAX0|4.0|Love this game can not put it down...no issues whatsoever ..wish I was able to pick my own layout at times&radic; but other then its great on kindle fire. this game gets two thumbs up.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Awesome game. Really easy but not so that it's no fun. Would say it's equally fun for kids and adults. Showed it to three co-workers and now they're addicted.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love this game app it has so many of the old school games from when i was a kid not to mention when your trying to kill time l!
B008MEM24S|4.0|I have been playing &quot;Where's my water?&quot; pretty much since it came out, and have beat the whole game. My husband and I play it together. Now, Phineas &amp; Ferb happen to be one of my families favorite shows, so when my friend with an I-phone told me about &quot;Where's my Perry?&quot; I was ecstatic! it took MONTHS to get onto the Amazon store (the only reason why this is getting four stars instead of five)! Other then that, I love this game and I cant fair for new levels to come out!
B005LAIIS0|4.0|This movie has multiple levels and interpretations.  Disguised as an over the top movie about monster wolves, beneath the surface are themes of dealing with loss, depression and accepting death.  There is a surreal feel about the film and the scenery is captivating.  If you take a symbolic interpretation, the film is much more satisfying.  Maybe they were trying to make a film that would appeal to both the masses and the film critics.  Or maybe the director had to insert stuff at the behest of the marketers.  Either way, for me it was both entertaining to watch and left me plenty to think about afterwards.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I didn't think I'd check this very often. I check the weather every time I'm on my Kindle. Super-user friendly and informative!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The whole series is very well written.  I enjoyed how the story developed.  Was a bit surprised in the beginning, but makes more sense as you go along.  I hope the series will continue, more than the prequel that i just read.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game solo much. omg. The graphics are amazing &amp; it also doesn't go too slow like other games. Phenomenology.
1439153663|4.0|I loved the story....it was a tough read at times.  Being very invested in the more likeable characters I have to say I was disappointed in the abrupt ending, too abrupt, which is why I only rated the book as 4 stars.  After suffering through a time span of 20 years with these folks perhaps an epilogue letting us know how their lives turned out in later years would have been more satisfying for me.  In any case, it was still a great read.
B001GZ6QEC|2.0|Of course its the best superhero movie ever made!  So hook us up with what?!!!!  Terrible foray into the blu ray market.  This is a FAN MOVIE!!!!  How the studio failed to figure this out when they designed the special features eludes me.  I mean are stupid people running the show?!  If you just want to see the movie in high def well you got to buy it. But when you find out that some producer spent all the special features budget on some six episodes of fictional seventh grader level banter to no end and you cant stand to watch any more, prepare for disappointment.

B007MNV5WU|1.0|i have to agree this update  and the decision to double charge kindle fire users takes my favorite game a dumps it in the trash.
B008JH5CVS|3.0|This is an action packed B movie. It moves fast and develops well. The story is well played. Its unfortunate that it had a small budget. You will like it if you are looking for bullets and a \\"jail\\" movie.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The games are fun to play until you beat the score you need. The higher section games are hard to get the points to unlock. It's a decent game to kill some time.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a good game. lots of choices. challenging and fun. this game provides hours of entertainment. not to mention its free
B003O86FMW|5.0|Absolutely love this series. Definitely think it's worth five stars. I hope this author comes out with more books sometime soon
B001UN1KVE|5.0|Yet another Mel Brooks movie that gets to poke a lot of fun at many other movies.  The Wizard of Oz, Star Wars, Star Trek and Alien all get the Mel Brooks comedy treatment.  Great for parties or when you just need something funny to calm down after a bad day at the office.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|If you want to escape reality for a couple hours, and drift off, get this film.  I love it. You have to watch it with surround sound, its 75% of the experience! A must have for any pink floyd fan!
B007VDN1PA|5.0|I've read the reviews and knew that items like this can be gems or duds but this I would reccmd. to anyone. As a matter of fact I did ... I advised my best friend of how well it worked on slides and he placed an order that day.<br /><br />You do need a pair of needle nose pliers to take out some slides ... older paper slides especially. No biggy but if that slot was just a tad wider and we're talking a mm or two ... would make all the difference. Make sure your slides are as clean as can be .. dust shows up. Scanned image is really nice. Better than the projected image! You can adjust exposure and other settings in the unit but I adjust for close and take it into Photoshop to tweek ... especially on older faded slides. I am VERY pleased with this purchase. I took a chance since I wasn't in a possiton to shell out the $400 for the scanner I really wanted.<br /><br />I've only done a couple sections of 35 mm negatives ... BUT again just as with the slides it works really well. No need to order the more expensive other brand that looks exactly like this one ... my guess it's the same ... I can't imagine it works any better than this one.<br /><br />Would I buy another ... if I needed it absolutely!
B000JCSPG0|5.0|At $4.99 when I purchased it, Amazon's digital copy of Stargate is a great value. Watch the movie that started a successful television franchise that combined for 16 season on television across three different series. If you're a Stargate fan and you don't already own this movie, go ahead and make the purchase to show your support for a great show. Hopefully, we'll see a return of Stargate one day.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the way it keeps a running total and I can always open and close it to keep my balance. It wooks great, I have found no bugs at all.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|The experience using a Kindle Fire as the remote to a Mac Mini Plexus Client is the best home theater experience I have seen at any price.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The Avengers..<br />great actors, Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron man,Chris Evans as Steve Rogers/Captain America, Mark Ruffalo as Dr. Bruce Banner/Hulk, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton/Hawkeye, Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow And Tom Hiddleston as Loki and other great actors such as Samuel L. Jackson, Cobie Smulders And Clark Gregg.<br />great story a few things i would like explained though such as Thor coming back to earth, Bruce Banner being able to control the Hulk but maybe they will be explain in the dvd/bluray release extras so waitin on that.<br /><br />Overall funny and enjoyable movie. It gets a bit boring when they are in the hellicarrier but thats the only downside of this film. The rest is great and i cant wait for the future projects of these films and The Avengers 2.<br /><br />even thought it is missing a few things it by far the best movie i seen, So i give it a 5 out of 5
B005869U6G|5.0|Had I reviewed this album the first time I heard it, it might have gotten 3 stars, but I'm so glad I waited until I heard it a few times.  I think my first impression was tainted with expectation, having been a long time fan and having an idea of what the Incubus \\"sound\\" WAS.  But I think those expectations are what made me appreciate this album more every time I listened to it. It's something fresh and different for them and for me.  This isn't a rocker album...it's something simple and beautiful with a lot of feeling.  Listen to it alone without distractions and you'll know what I mean.  It's great because it's so Incubus without being so Incubus, if that makes sense.
B006LSZECO|2.0|It is possible for a book idea to  \\"look good on paper\\" and not turn out so well. That is \\"Girl Gone.\\" Although the idea of two physically appealing but psychologically repellant people being locked in a personal game of \\"gotcha\\" may seem interesting, ultimately I didn't wish either of them well. The longer the book went on, the more alike the two \\"voices\\" became, and the ending was just silly.<br /><br />So, maybe a beach read but suspend disbelief to do so.
B0073PPKNM|5.0|I pre-ordered Melody Gardot's The Absence, being a boundless fan ever since I discovered her drift a few years ago. Her sense of music and things far less definable have happily wiped away a void I've had to contend with for too long, while constantly adding older and still older music to my collection and listening choices. Now, though, once again it's a wonder and delight to hear beauty that's new and fresh while still maintaining that tradition of newness and freshness. Plus I really dig her freaky departures and joyously so.<br /><br />(Is it 'tristeza' or 'triste' Melody sings early in Mira? Astrud Gilberto's Tristeza is my second-most played song in my iTunes.)<br /><br />I adore that aspirated h- and some vowels she sings: I wonder if it's hommage to her grandmother's influence. Her accent is thick Mid-Atlantic and an important feature of her distinctive talent. Her naturalness is uncanny. Oh, and the post-production doesn't remove her breath-takings. They are part of her singing, one of many dimensions in her voice. (Barbra's noisy breath-taking was always made invisible, so to say, and mercifully.)<br /><br />The Latin rhythms tap into my musical bias and enthrall me. She and the musicians cook. We feast. I want to say Melody Gardot is better than astounding, or better than anyone has already said. She's simply lovely.<br /><br />This Amazon Customer Review feature is impossible to overpraise. I was about to write to Amazon and request an exchange or a purchase credit until I read these reviews and Melody's response. When I got the new CD, I burned a copy for the car, but when the last track seemed to end and the disc didn't eject or stop, I assumed I didn't burn right, so I burned another, and concluded something was amiss. Tonight I listened to the original through a new stereo amp, heard the 'clicks and pops', let it play through the silence to determine if it was part of the recording, discovered the ending music, but still wondered if the disc was defective. Thanks to these Customer Reviews, I discovered the Truth. Okay: If you play the last track backwards, it begins with traffic and bells that sound backwards, and before the middle silence, the clicks and pops come early, but now they end with attacks but begin with nano sustains. I get it now.ctive. Thanks to these Customer Reviews, I discovered the Truth.

B004LWZW6K|1.0|The first Piranha was a good movie... cheesey but entertaining. Piranha DD was a way for the producers, etc to show as many boobs as they could and attempt to make the movie both scary and sexy at the same time... in my opinion they failed!  And what is with the children getting killed?! How tasteless and tacky do you have to be to put into a movie a little girl being run over by a golf cart and ending a movie with a young boy getting his head eaten off?  Just like all the reality shows, Hollywood will do anything to make a buck.
B004LDLI0S|5.0|I'm not reviewing any kindle edition here, just Mein Kampf  as a book. This is a must-read for eveyone. If every American knew Mein Kampf like the palm of his hand Joe McCarthy never could have caused the Blacklist.  Lyndon Johnson would not have been able to expand the Vietnam War. Nixon never would have been elected. Reagan never would have become President.  George W, Bush and Cheney wouldn't have been able to sell us the Iraq war. The \\"trickle-down\\" theory of economics and the decimation of labor unions never would have happened. This book is a course in recognizing Right-Wing scare tactics and spin for what they are - very clever lies designed to seduce the gullible.  The evil genius of Hitler shines in this book. He was a master at manipulating the media to hoodwink people - way ahead of his time. If he had used his propaganda savvy to serve the welfare of the German people and not his mental illness what a different world this would be today. You owe it to yourself to read this book.

B007L3BMGA|5.0|I wasn't going to buy this book but I caved in to peer pressure to see what all the fuss was about.  I'm glad I did!  Wow!!!! What a book - I couldn't put it down and read it in three days.  On the edge all the time.  Ending was not what I expected at all!.  Great read and I will be reading all three of the series.

1416968725|5.0|Say what you want about the predictable ending, getting there is more than half the fun.<br /><br />Start on the title page, as the egg rolls away from the Simon & Schuster logo, see all the birds cozying their eggs, and meet the (male) duck who hasn't laid one!<br /><br />The egg he finds is mocked by the other birds, whose eggs begin to hatch quite soon.<br /><br />Fractional pages turn to reveal eggs cracking and hatchlings interacting with their parent, while the duck sits on... knits on, I mean.<br /><br />Until... ruh-roh.  Of course, there's a surprise ending, and the creature imprints on the duck and follows his waddling form out the back of the book.  Check out the webbed baby booties!<br /><br />And then (turn away if you are squeamish), check out the alternate ending on the back cover of the book... that's why we LOVE Emily Gravett.  You don't HAVE to read that to your kids... but if your kids are like mine, that pop ending is the best surprise of the book!<br /><br />We are in a golden age of children's book publishing.  More books like this, please.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|I watched this movie twice on a long distance flight and am buying the blu-ray just now. I like the fact that real Seal's are the lead actors in the movie. It ensures a level of realism in the action scenes. Who cares that they may not be the World's best actors! If that is likely to bother you then just don't watch the movie. The action is fast moving and will keep you on the edge of your seat. I know the plot is fictional but the movie really does make you appreciate what they put on the line for us.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Incredible game! Gamewise there is nothing to complain about. although a spectacular game I am a little upset over something right now. I just updated the version and it told me that it needed to be reinstalled but it didn't say that all the highscores would be reset. if I knew that was to happen I wouldn't have installed the update :(<br />I was over half done the game with mostly 3 stars and golden eggs. if this is going to happen again it would be nice if there was some sort of warning that all of your achievements would be reset!<br />5 star game no doubt but this idled me.

B004SBQGHS|1.0|I just lost all my previous work on this game by updating. Angry Birds Space did the same thing. It's absolutely ridiculous that they would do this, and I have bought my last Rovio game. Nice job upsetting the people who supported you from day one.

B008FLYM50|5.0|I was excited for Marina's new album as soon as I heard the concept. I fell in love with every new song as it was released, especially because most of them dealt with heartbreak and loneliness - something I was going through at the same time.<br /><br />However, when the whole album was released, I was very disappointed as the album was very repetitive. They were good as standalone tracks, but too many of the songs deal with heartbreak. Both Starring Role and Lies are about the same thing and share lyrical similarities. Bubblegum Bitch and Primadonna are also very alike, though the songs do sound very different musically. And I felt that the four archetypes were underdeveloped.<br /><br />After listening for some time though, I grew to love the album more and more. Though the songs seem alike lyrically, each song sounds different from the rest. The songs are strong and catchy. But the whole album gets stronger towards the end. Teen Idle and Valley of the Dolls are absolutely haunting. Hypocrates is a very feel-good song, and Fear and Loathing is the perfect ending for this concept album.  The album isn't perfect, but I still give it 5 stars simply because Marina's voice is amazing throughout.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this album to anyone, Marina fan or not. Especially the UK deluxe version, which comes with 4 extra tracks. Radioactive, Sex Yeah, Lonely Hearts Club (beautiful song), and Buy the Stars.
0060573775|4.0|I picked up this audiobook from my library's shelf because Ethan Hawke is narrating it. I loved Ethan Hawke ever since Great Expectations, so I was really curious. The name \\"Slaughterhouse 5\\" vaguely reminded me of a book that I might have had to read in high school, or maybe not. It was very vague. But I also knew the book was famous, and no reason why.<br /><br />So...what did I think?<br /><br />Well, most people will say they didn't like the book because of the jumpy timeline. Actually, I didn't mind it. I wasn't IN LOVE with it either. But the author did a REALLY good job of making sure WE KNEW when Billy (the main character) was \\"getting unstuck in time.\\" So even though it was constantly moving forward and backward all over the place, it really wasn't too bad. It did have a \\"Main\\" timeline of Billy suffering through WW2 and the bombing of Dresden.<br /><br />Style-wise,  Vonnegut is really a good writer. There was a part where he described Dresden as \\"If angels could build a city, which all its curves and heavenly sky, Dresden would be that city.\\" And you know what? I could totally picture the curves, and colors, and sky, and sun of that heavenly city, even though I've never seen old pictures of Dresen before WW2, if there even are any.<br /><br />I will say this, it's not an easy book to read. Between the story lines and the subject matter, it really does need to be read by a more adult audience to be able to keep up and capture it all. But that's not to say a smart high schooler can read it.<br /><br />And so, I liked this book. I didn't like the war, and suffering, and bombing, and death. But it certainly was a different way of writing about the same subject. I recommend it to others.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Very relaxing, super easy to use, lets you save combinations of sounds, binaural tone to relax and for sleeping and dreaming. I love it!

0380713802|1.0|I'm a travel enthusiast, or at least a dreaming-about-traveling enthusiast, so I picked up this book for a little summer \\"getaway\\" of my own. I read the whole book, but there were numerous times I put it down to absorb something shocking Bryson said or to read a particularly ridiculous passage to my boyfriend. Bryson is incredibly negative about every single place he goes to, the exceptions being Copenhagen, Amsterdam, and Italy (at least Rome and Sorrento). Bryson seems to direct most of his disappointment and, quite honestly, thinly veiled dislike of Germans and German-speaking countries, as well as most of northern Europe. It's not just that he bitches about train schedules, public workers, the sound of the German language, how terrible their food is (and all of this gets pretty annoying after awhile), it's that he seems to bring up the horror of WWII every chance he gets in the appropriate countries. He seemed to look at Germans as inferior, and was appalled that the old men he encountered could have been Nazis 50 years earlier. Good God! I didn't know I was settling in for a depressing and pretty judgmental portrait of central Europeans. This constant theme was tedious, as well as his blatant elitism. There was one lovely passage where Bryson speaks of the \\"typical\\" haughty manner of European service workers and writes that, in effect, these workers are inferior because they spend their lives waiting on other people, so clearly they aren't doing something important. Although Bryson is often sarcastic, this was not a sarcastic passage. It was appalling.<br />Oh, and the constant complaining about tourists and how they're ruining Italy, the Alps, and most other countries he went to is ridiculous, as he was among them.<br />The only positive thing I can say about this book is that there are some passages that are funny and had me giggling to myself. However, once I realized that the entire book was going to be about him bitching about every single place he went to, I just plowed through the rest of it as fast as I could to get it over with.

1442419814|5.0|I remember when this book first came out it was ALL anybody talked about. At the time I didn't want to read it but recently I decided that I wanted to give it a chance.<br /><br />In the beginning I wasn't drawn into the book but it didn't take long before the story picked up speed. Before long I couldn't wait to keep turning the pages to find out what happened to Tally and her friends.<br /><br />The book is about a future post apocalyptic world in which people exist as \\"Uglies\\" until they turn 16. At 16 they get an operation to turn them into \\"Pretties\\". Once you get the op your life consists of little more than parties, fun, and being around people who are just as gorgeous as you are. Tally's best friend in the world turned pretty 3 whole months before she did and now she wants nothing more than to join him in New Pretty Town and be beautiful.<br /><br />Shortly before the operation Tally meets a fellow ugly named Shay. Shay is tricky and adventurous just like she is but unlike Tally, Shay isn't so sure that turning pretty is all it's cracked up to be. It turns out that she wants to leave before the operation and do the unthinkable: live as an Ugly forever. Tally is horrified and refuses to join Shay but it turns out that her troubles have just started. Special Circumstances give Tally an ultimatum: either find the secret society of runaway Uglies that Shay has joined or live as a disgraced Ugly forever.<br /><br />Tally is now faced with a difficult choice to make of either betraying the trust of someone she cares about or breaking her promise to her BFF about becoming a Pretty with him. When Tally sets out to find answers to her own questions she discovers a secret about the world she has always known that makes her question everything she's ever known about what it means to be Pretty.<br /><br />Basically the book may start out as underwhelming but it takes you on the adventure of a lifetime. By the end of the book I promise you'll be wishing you had a hoverboard to go zipping around the city. Tally is a completely relatable character because she's flawed. In so many books you find an unrealistically perfect heroine that readers cannot connect to but Tally's downfalls are what makes her such a well rounded leading female. Tally is rebellious and quirky but she wants to conform just like anyone else but she finds out that maybe being unique is better that being pretty.<br /><br />The way the book ended made me immediately pick up the next book in the series and start reading.ard to go zipping around the city.

1416972242|4.0|BE WARNED THERE WILL BE SPOILERS! City of Ashes is a great sequel to a great series. I'm on book 3 right now. City of Ashes takes place a week after the events that happened in City of Bones. Jace and Clary still stuggle with their feelings for each other because they know they're brother and sister yet they still have romantic feelings for each other.I know that in future books we'll probably find out that Clary and Jace aren't brother and sister. You see that from a mile away. Clary trys to have a relationship with her friend Simon and trys to forget her feelings for Jace but doesn't do a good job of it. I love the story and the plot of Valentines is to raise a demon army and the shadow hunters must stop him. I love all the characters. They all have personality and spunk to them and aren't one dimensional. I love Jace more than Edward Cullen. Jace can be arrogant at times and a bit rude, but theres also a kind side to him and some sense of humor even behind the rudeness. Some of that bad stuff about him he uses to deny things or cover up something. I love Clary but at times with the whole Simon Jace situation she can be a bit annoying. She gets annoyed when Simon is around other girls but at the same time she doesn't love him like Jace. Maybe its just her looking out for a friend. Which is why at the end I was happy that Simon broke off the relationship with Clary because unlike Clary, he wasn't trying to deny her feelings. I also love Maias backstory as to how she became a wearwolf and before that that explains why she isn't too trustworthy toward men. Toward the end Simon and Maia will start to have a relationship I wonder how that relationship will do since Simon is a vampire and vampires and wearwolves hate each other. The second book was good there were things that could have been better but overall I liked it. I'm reading book 3 right now.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The Capitol is growing desperate as Katniss is incorporated into the rebellion, for the most part against her will. This last book is a wonderful example of how anything taken to an extreme is sure to be a bad thing. No matter what side you are on, once the line is crossed, it pretty much looks the same from either side. I felt this book was almost entirely a slow, depressing slide to the end, and there isn't much left at the finish, but what does remain is beautiful and powerful. Wonderful series!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great game and I love it for my opinion I think youshould get it because its fun and free
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|This is set to be a modern timeless classic,equally good in English as Japanese,this is a must buy to any collection,will keep the kids enthralled(if their attention span allows)as it will parents.........my wife watches it alot(half Japanese)and never gets bored with it,was a worthwhile purchase and will be buying some more copies for family members and friends who loved it as I dont like lending out DVD's............just dont like them scratched or out of my collection so buying more is a great gift for those who like this studios offerings.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|i would recommend the hunger games to anyone who asks about it. it is a fast moving series that will keep you at te edge of your seat. i want to read the series over and over till i get sick of it.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Great movie for those who are like me and are fascinated by the artwork and detail,some of these movies are long upwards of 2 hours.........kids here seem to watch from begining to end without a problem but depends on the attention span of your kids.Adults equally enjoy them as invariably the story line is interesting too.Worthwhile movie if you are into colecting these editions.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great App...let's you know what is draining your power. Set alerts to warn battery getting low &amp; when recharged. FREE too!
B0006J28BO|5.0|Yep.............another good Japanese offering,not just for the kids.........if you are fascinated by the artwork and detail as I am you will appreciate these movies.This is a popular studio that Disney are also involved with so if you want to have an inexpensive collection then these will work for you,Amazon carries nearly all of their works currently available in the USA. My preference is to watch these in the original Japanese but English is also very good.A worthwhile purchase.
1416550550|4.0|I listened to the audio book version and really enjoyed it.  I have a different standard for audio books (than I do for books I read myself in a printed format).  They have to be read at a pace that allows me to understand what's being said (the actual words being read) and what's happening in the story while I'm driving my car, the voice of the reader has to be pleasant and agreeable and the story has to hold my attention.  I'm generally able to suspend disbelief more easily when I'm listening to an audio book.<br /><br />I liked the characters Kate Morton created and loved the story, a woman trying to uncover the mystery of who she is and where she came from.  I also loved the period of time that was covered.  The story had dark and sinister facets and I would have liked it if they had been expanded upon a little more.<br /><br />This story captured my attention and held it through to the end.  I liked the way the author slowly revealed parts of the past so the reader knows things the characters don't, I thought this added to the suspense of the story.  The narration by different characters was not confusing when listening to the audio book because the reader did such a wonderful job of creating individual voices for each of them.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Another GREAT movie,I collect these from this particular studio mainly due to the superb artwork and attention to detail,needless to say,overall an easy 5 star rating as with ALL their movies I prefer watching the movie in Japanese but is equally good in English.A worthwhile purchase and a must have to any collection.
B006Z2XTBY|4.0|I liked this story and thought the writing was good. Boyd intersperses interesting details throughout and creates realistic characters with believable dialogue.  The story is well paced and suspenseful but also has contemporary issues that are worthy of contemplation.<br /><br />I sympathized with the protagonist and liked thinking about how difficult it would be to go \\"off the grid\\" if you were on the run the way he was.  I liked what the author did with the ending but at the same time I was expecting something a little more forceful, more of a bang I guess.  Overall a good story, well written and suspenseful.
1581806574|5.0|Who isn't fascinated by dragons?  The decades-long success of Anne McCaffrey's Pern and the DragonLance Chronicles show that young people and their elders alike love these sometimes-benevolent, sometimes-villainous, and always artogenic (if that's a word!) creatures.  \\"Neondragon\\" Peffer is one of the best dragon artists around, and even if (like me) you can't draw a straight line without a ruler, you can still appreciate this instructional book purely as a collection of paintings.  Her dragons come in all imaginable colors, with all kinds of wings, heads, limbs, tails, you name it.  There's also a large section of other mythological and fantastical creatures such as the Phoenix, Chimera, Pegasus, and many others.  And, of course, as an art instruction manual it's detailed and useful.

B0081L37Z0|2.0|Probably both of their worst movie, based on basically genitals and getting high and a few predictable punchlines to try to make it funny. How anyone can give humor this lacking of any kind of substance or intelligence (even the so-called intelligence in the movie was not even close to impressive). I was disappointed. The trailer is pretty much all of the movie. The rest is just filler fluff that makes you want to cringe.

B005LAIHY0|1.0|The best compliment I can give Prometheus is that, well, there's actually 2 compliments I can give Prometheus:<br /><br />1. It's very pretty looking<br />2. It's better than the Phantom Menace<br /><br />Seriously. People keep comparing this to The Phantom Menace, and that's so unfair. It's easily better. For one it's prettier and there's some nice creepy characters. But ultimately, Prometheus is a movie so bad that I can only recommend it to people the same way I recommend The Phantom Menace: not at all.<br /><br />Before people tell me I didn't get this movie or I didn't grow up in the time the Alien was released: I actually grew up with these movies in my video collection. I like Alien, Aliens and Alien 3, but Alien Ressurection disappointed me greatly. And let's not even get started on those horrid Alien Vs. Predator movies- those movies are just plain insulting to both franchises. And sadly, so is Prometheus. Oh, and I got it just perfectly. It's too bad the film is just a steaming pile of crap, though.<br /><br />One thing I could imagine was that Ridley must have overheard his 5 year old grandson telling a friend a story when coming up with the idea for the film. Seriously. \\"And then a robot can see people's memories, and then they go to a planet, and there's a cave with all these coccoons, and then they find a head, then they bring it back to their ship, then they revive it, then it explodes, and then the robot puts alien blood in a guy's drink, and then the woman scientist has a baby in her tummy, and then she removes it from her stomach but it's not really a baby but an alien and then the guy turns into an alien, then they go to a cave, and then they meet a bald guy, and then the robot gets his head torn off, then the woman goes back to the ship, and then the alien from her tummy didn't die there and fights the bald guy that followed her...\\" seriously. As Peter Griffin says, \\"There, I just saved you two long and boobless hours!\\"<br /><br />In addition to such a ludicrous plot, There's also hideously bad acting- I typically love Noomi Rapace but she was abysmal. Not her fault, she is a Swede, so why make her a Brit? Charlize was just boring to watch and spoke all her lines in a similar fashion to Kristen Stewart. Shaw's boyfriend was bad too, and the only good performance was from Michael Fassbender. I felt sorry for him, watching him be the one good actor in a film riddled with bad performances.<br /><br />Then there's the dialogue. Dear lord. I swear for 10 minutes the dialogue consided of \\"Prometheus are you seeing this? Prometheus did you catch the image I just saw? Prometheus are you still following us?\\" I swear if I heard the word \\"Prometheus\\" one more time I was going to walk out of the cinema. And that horrid \\"I am your father\\" moment... UGH.<br /><br />Just avoid this film at all cost. It will ruin everything you love about the Alien movies.such a ludicrous plot, There's also hideously bad acting- I typically love Noomi Rapace but she was abysmal. Not her fault, she is a Swede, so why make her a Brit? Charlize was just boring to watch and spoke all her lines in a similar fashion to Kristen Stewart. Shaw's boyfriend was bad too, and the only good performance was from Michael Fassbender.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|Others have written better reviews. Take my advice - read this.  It is money and time well spent.  This might be the best \\"budget\\" book I have ever read... and I have tried way too many.
B00782O7IY|2.0|I give this turkey two stars for two reasons-I like 1920s art, clothing, and decor, theatrical ploys like foreshadowing and symbolism (which are always fun),  and the performers act their hearts out on this paper-thin script.<br />And that is ALL , folks.<br />The story was more predictable than a kids' movie.<br />The main character is foolish, rude, ignorant, vain, selfish, and a drunk.<br />The female love-interest puts up with all his abuse for the whole story, as she (and we) \\"know\\" he will change five  minutes before the end of the film.  Wow.  Yeah. That.<br />Now for the bad news- it uses a \\"what-if\\" suspention of belief plot device about 10 minutes in-for no reason!<br />Then, about 45 minutes farther along, they add another impossible pretext -also unnecessariliy- which contradicts the first one.  Was this the first big hit written by an 8 year old compusive liar??<br /> Hollywood likes to pat itself on the back for taking risks, trying something new, and remembering the pioneering efforts of the great directers from 90 years ago.<br />Or feeling as if they had.<br />  The politics around who votes on academy awards is less rigorous then the process of picking a small town's dog-catcher. (No offence meant to the latter. Thank you guys.)<br />Oh well-- see you at the movies!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Its a cool game, play it to keep busy when I have nothing to do. Has many minks that's still need to be worked out.
B0052VUNHC|2.0|And not because it kept me on the edge of my seat. I have to respectfully disagree with a reviewer who said this book was great for adults to read -- it felt very juvenile. Truly, I don't even know why the main characters were attracted to one another. I didn't care if they wound up together or not -- I just wanted it to be over.
B00005ASOC|5.0|This is probably one of the most entertaining Sean Connery movies that a lot of people don't know about.  It has a somewhat slower pace to the movie, but it's definitely worth the watch.
B008MEM24S|5.0|this app is very fun and it is just like where's my water. I recommend it to anyone who has some time to kill.
B003629IPW|5.0|For all the die hard MJ fans or anyone curious about his life as a performer, this is THE video to get.  Despite his controversial life, this video gives you a birds eye view of Michael Jackson the performer.  Whatever your opinion of Michael Jackson the man, there is no denying his ability as a musician and a performer.  If you're an MJ fan, this video will reinforce your belief in his unmatched musical capability.  If you're not an MJ fan, this video will open your eyes up to his talent and help you see him in a different light.  Whatever your opinion, there is no denying that this video is entertaining and worth watching every minute!
0307730697|4.0|It took me a great deal of deliberate thought to decide how to rate and review this book.  After reading a few other posters comment on the same things that I was tossing over and over in my mind, I came to the conclusion that I would still give this book a 4 star review, but with a caution to any Christian considering this read.  It has limited amounts of profanity, as well as some unnecessary and vulgar accounts of incidents.  Some reviewers have said that they enjoyed this for adding a sense of realism to the book.  I actually disagree and feel like the curses and vulgar accounts were not necessary, and detracted from an otherwise great telling of this man's life.  I was especially surprised when I came across these items because I was aware that it was from a Christian publisher.  At any rate, said occurrences were limited in amount and were definitely overshadowed by the legacy this man left behind and is recounted in the book.<br /><br />What I really loved about this book was the way that it presented so many aspects of who Adam Brown was.  He wasn't just a marine - he was a committed Christian, devoted husband, loving father, faithful servant, heroic leader, and loyal friend.  I felt like the author opened up a door for us to get inside  Adam's head and heart to see the complexity of a man who leads with a heart of valor, while internally struggling with addiction beyond the understanding of many Christians, myself included.  While at times the image presented seems almost super-human, the author did a great job bringing out the fun-loving, simple-living man that Adam Brown was.  He did some amazing things, but at the end of the day, he was still flesh and bone and the kind of guy anyone would want to hang out with.  His story is truly worth reading!<br /><br />With that being said, I wish the author had included the gospel message, especially after reading the afterword.  The afterword states \\"One of Adam Brown's final wishes ... was that his spiritual testimony ... be told, including 'My life before I met Jesus Christ and Kelley.'\\"  I think that Adam would have wanted a clear presentation of the truth of God's word - that we are sinners in need of a savior; that the son of God (Jesus Christ) came to earth, lived a sinless life, died on the cross to pay the penalty for our sins, and conquered death by rising from the grave; and that we have the opportunity to have eternal life if we will trust in Jesus as our savior.  A spiritual testimony for a Christian is given out of desire for others to hear the gospel proclaimed through his or her own story, and I think Adam would have wished this be included in his story.  Considering that the author is not a Christian, I feel he did a good job of evidencing the strong change in Adam as a result of God's work in his life and it likely didn't occur to the author that the presentation of the gospel is such a crucial aspect of a Christian's spiritual testimony.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this book to a limited audience of mature readers.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received a free copy of this book from the publisher in return for an honest review.<br /><br />Mrs. Renninger
B0054JZC6E|4.0|There are some great mini games on here. So far they are fun and quick. You don't get all the games at once you have to play others several tomes to earn enough points to open others.
B004B63M1S|4.0|I have had friends tell me they didn't like this movie because it seemed a little too fake, but I understood going into it that it was intended to seem that way...sort of in the 70s shock picture style, kinda like Rodriguez & Tarrentino's grindhouse picture movies Deathproof and Planet Terror.  It isn't exactly one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen, but I still thought it was pretty awesome...totally a guy movie.  If you can handle a bit of gore and some language & some full fledged nudity don't bother you, I definitely recommend giving this movie a watch...just watch it without the kids, because definitely not appropriate for their eyes and ears!  Beyond that though, this movie is pretty cool!  I also recommend [[ASIN:B000ASDFI6 Robert Rodriguez Mexico Trilogy (El Mariachi / Desperado / Once Upon A Time In Mexico)]], [[ASIN:B004SIPA4G Sin City (Two-Disc Theatrical & Recut, Extended, and Unrated Versions) [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B003VMFWYI Grindhouse (Two-Disc Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray]]], and [[ASIN:B00004RJ74 From Dusk Till Dawn (Dimension Collector's Series)]]
B004EBT5CU|4.0|Thanks for everything the product is great and came on time.I will do business with you again than you so much.
B008RC72G8|4.0|This was a great modern day reimagining of a classic show, and I very much enjoyed it.  I am a long time Tim Burton fan, and although it is not one of my absolute favorites of his, I still found it to be quite enjoyable.  Johnny Depp was cool as Barnabus Collins, and the rest of the cast also played their roles very well.  If you're a fan of vampire movies in whatever fashion or a Tim Burton fan or just want something imaginitive and/or entertaining to watch, I highly recommend checking out this movie.  I for one will be adding this to my Tim Burton collection.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|After playing through more than half the game I just had all of my progress deleted when the game updated.  Completely unacceptable.  Wrecked an otherwise solid and enjoyable game (would have been a five star review if not for this massive flaw).  How the developers can make such a stupid error is amazing.  Suggest you do not update your game due to this risk in future updates.  Will not play this again, and will warn friends about this.
B003Y5H5BA|4.0|LoL, and such is one of my favorites lines and scenes in the movie!  I had never seen this before buying it, but I had friends & family tell me it was really funny and I found a good used price on a copy so I snagged it.  Although some of it was a tad crass, I laughed so much through this movie.  It was definitely a good call to pick this one up.  I enjoyed the cameo by the original 21 Jump Street duo in it as well.  If you like a good laugh and don't mind a bit of crude language, definitely check this movie out...it's pretty funny.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|By FAR the best game I've played so far on my Kindle Fire.  It wasn't too hard &amp; there are hints if you need them- I'm not sure what reviewers who complained about those issues were talking about.  I wish there were more games like this instead of so many &quot;hidden object only&quot; games.  Those games are too easy &amp; repetitive to enjoy playing - at least for me.  Trust me, if you are going to spend money on a game- spend it on this one.  You won't regret it.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Speedy service; ordered it late yesterday and had it today!  I was able to transfer pictures from computer to Kindle and love it!!  Have to admit it took me a little to find the pics but now I know.  Not that long though HA!  Thank you Amazon!
B002IYEQR4|5.0|An overpowering adaptation of a classic grapic novel, The Watchmen Ultimate Edition takes you further into the dark alternate earth of 1985. I grew up on the graphic novel and I have to be honest this Edition finally surpasses any expectations. The cast assembled was perfect and the landscape for the tale was overwhelming at the least. Even a non-comic book fan , could find enjoyment with this film and still be left with a need for more. The only flaw I found with this movie was the use of that god-awful EMO band My Chemical Romance. Sorry my personal opinion is that that style/music is terrible. Sorry boys but skinny jeans are for women and homosexual men.

B005LAIGN2|3.0|How do you rate a film you really want to like but has many short comings? I'll keep it simple.<br /><br />This is a story that really needed to  be told. In the past, the story of the Tuskegee airmen usually revolves around the early days of the struggle to be recognized and accepted. This film does that, especially in the accompanying documentary.  However the film also depicts the actual wartime experiences of these brave pioneers of African-American civil rights. The aerial sequences are astoundingly good as is the portrayal of aerial combat. The war in Italy in 1944 is realistically depicted. So is Army Air Force pilot life. People interested in World War II military history and USAF vets (I am one) will treasure the depiction of the men and aircraft in this film. You will wonder how the producers managed to get so many working WWII planes and you will struggle to tell the difference between the CGI aircraft and the real ones. The only sour note in this film is the cliche ridden dialogue and inane chatter between the pilots. However I have been around real real military aircrews to know that some of these verbal groaners actually do occur, but to place so many in a motion picture takes the viewers attention away from the story.<br /><br />Watch this film for the excellent photography and ignore the cornball script.
B008A1NSTG|5.0|My review I hope says it all. Very good cast & of course, the whales were especially well cast. Not sure who played them but I hope they get a lot of work after this film. Mostly fun, this movie had it's drama & it never lost it's balance. Kristin Bell did a nice job & of course, it's hard to go wrong with Drew Barrymore. I especially liked how the switch between the news reporting & the story scenes seamlessly moved from one to the other. Just a great movie. Plus, the guy gets the girl in the end & that was a nice bonus.

B0081L37Z0|4.0|I laughed! it made fun of all the reasons I liked that show as a teenager. And Depp and his partner making a cameo, come on! this is not film magic it's crap fun! and really for $1.20 red box or now $.99 amazon it is worth and hour 45 or so.
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|This review is based on having watched the film at home on Blu-ray with my family.<br /><br />Although I was never a huge fan of the comics as a child, I remember every Saturday morning watching the TV cartoon adventures, divided into short episodes which always seemed to finish with Tintin and his friends apparently about to get shot, blown up, or drowned, only to miraculously escape at the start of the next episode. Whenever I think about Tintin I can still hear the ridiculously overdramatised narrator's voice from forty years ago, asking whehter our heroes will meet some dreadful fate and telling the listener to find out next week on \\"Herge's Adventures of Tintin!\\"<br /><br />In a nice touch, this superb example of modern animation starts with a nod to the original comics and TV cartoons as Tintin, whose face is at first out of shot, is walking in the market and a street artist offers to draw a cartoon of him. We see first the cartoon, which looks just like the Herge cartoons, and then the modern animation of Tintin as it is handed to him.<br /><br />This film is apparently based on three of the favourite Tintin stories: \\"[[ASIN:1405262397 The Secret of the Unicorn (Adventures of Tintin)]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:1405262400 Red Rackham's Treasure (Adventures of Tintin)]],\\" and \\"[[ASIN:1405208082 The Crab with the Golden Claws (Adventures of Tintin)]].\\"<br /><br />It features the indomitable boy reporter, his dog snowy, Captain Haddock, and the bumbling policemen Thompson and Thomson.<br /><br />Just like the original this film is preposterous but highly entertaining escapist fantasy and was both amusing and exciting: both Tintin and the bad guys regularly achieve the impossible, but it is very easy to suspend disbelief while you're watching the film and just enjoy it.<br /><br />Quality of the animation was very high indeed and in places you could almost have been watching something real.<br /><br />A very high-powered voice cast brought out the voices beautifully and soundedvery like the original TV series.<br /><br />A treat for present day kids and \\"big kids\\" reliving their childhood alike.
0385523904|5.0|Very well written  book, I highly recommend it and already have to my friends and family. It was hard to put down this captivating tale of a place so foreign to any American. It's difficult to comprehend living the way the average NOrth KOrean lives. You will appreciate your circumstances as much as you'll feel sorry for these poor people in the worlds largest prison for no fault of their own other than being born In the wrong place at the wrong time. Great book!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|not all sounds are perfect but most are. tons of fun to play with while mixing your perfect sound. great app.!!!
0307592731|1.0|It did not take long to realize how dumb and stupid the main character is.  A lot of people have had sorrowful lives but did not come out as selfish and incapable of stringing two positive thoughts together.<br /><br />Sensitive people who love animals will stop reading when the wishy washy character FINALLY makes up her mind to do something she should have taken care of years sooner.<br /><br />If the book had only stayed on PCT instead of wallowing in self pity, it might have been OK.  It seemed like it was going to be a book of good and bad trail experiences which would have this women finally become a thinking human, but that part was just \\"mentioned\\" briefly on and off.<br /><br />I could just not finish the book.
0765316994|2.0|I was bitterly disappointed by this book.  The trademark humour seems to be all but gone, characters are shallow, the 'science' is atrociously bad and the writing is prosaic.  Loved the OMW series, thought Fuzzy Nation was _OK_ but Redshirts is really scraping the bottom of the barrel.  Scalzi's books have gone from something I would read at the first opportunity to something that I'll read only if there is nothing else around.
B0086700CM|5.0|its fun to play!!!!!<br />I enjoy playing this game I have had no problems or issues with it yet I hope to not have any
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love Perry. Fun game, and I'm not a phone game guy. Even better than Meowch.  I like all the voices.
0805095535|4.0|Paul Auster's [[ASIN:0805095535 Winter Journal]] is a compelling review of his life up to age 64.  Very well written, though rather oddly done in the 2nd person (perhaps because he sees his body as outside of himself?).  I read it in two sittings on a single day, unwilling to stop even though little in the book is really compelling.  It should perhaps be titled \\"Autumn Journal\\" as it ends \\"You have entered the winter of your life.\\", which seems an accurate description of what life is like at age 64.<br /><br />There's a fascinating rhythm to the language in the book, like a fast walk through the streets of Manhattan.  This is quite deliberate as the author discusses writing as a lesser form of dance, based on the rhythms of walking.  Such writing is a pleasure and there are a number of these pleasures throughout the book.<br /><br />I found two sections of the memoir to be especially good.  His description of his mother's death is quite moving.  And oddly enough, his summary of the plot to the 1950 movie \\"D.O.A.\\" somehow becomes both personal and powerful.<br /><br />I suspect that this memoir would be of less interest to younger readers, but for this late middle-aged reader it was completely absorbing and provided some (cold) comfort in knowing that we all face similar problems of body, memory, and meaning as we approach the winter of our lives.

B005HEUF0Y|5.0|when I first watched this it was when it first broadcast, I was 21 and I was too busy to give it my full attention, I remember I was working on something else as I watched and found it \\"bazaar and unrelatable\\" and yet now that I watch, tears come to my eyes, I had no idea of the caliper of this epsiode, the Inner Light, truely had an effect on me today as I watch it on the Amazon Prime Streaming.  It was touching and very well conceved the best Star Trek plot I have ever witnessed.  I am really impressed with STTNG, though I preferred ST Classics back then in my twentysomething days, I now think STTNG is much better and deeper. although I still think some other episodes of STTNG can be a bit flimsy(particularly season two) I think that the ones that aren't far out weigh the ones that are and this is one that is not flimsy or watered down and to the contrary is masterful and pheonominal! A well written plot and acted and directed in the same way. So in closing, I recommend getting \\"The Next Level\\" which has this as one of the three best choices to sample TNG in blu-ray fashion.<br /><br />Picard played the flute yet again in another episode later on but I can't recall which episode or season.
0143121316|3.0|I expected more.  This book reads like series of extended historical essays written on China with a few (largely favorable) memories tossed in to justify the author's vantage point.  While Kissinger's musings are interesting and important, they grow tiresome (especially in the later pages) and there isn't the real historical heft to the rest of the book to save a reader when they grow wary of the reminiscing.  A decent read, but by no means a great one.

B006LSZECO|1.0|Even if this book was free, I wouldn't think it was worth the money. I knew from the beginning what was revealed halfway through the book and nothing surprised me during the entire book. I couldn't like any of the characters and found the writing irritating and oddly phrased. It seemed the author thought the more you describe something, the more interesting it became but it just seemed lame, like she was trying to fill pages. The only reason I finished this book was to find out the resolution, not that I was excited to see what was going to happen. To me, it was all so sad and depressing. I makes me hungry to read a well-written book that I can enjoy.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|its realy cool and fun to look at! it tells me how much time I have to do the things I want so I don't have to worry about the battery dying!
0345803485|1.0|The gal I work next to finished this book so I asked if I could borrow it to see what all the fuss was about.  Are you kidding me?  The level of writing in this book is so juvenile and overtly graphic.  I could go on and on like other reviews have...but why bother?  I  read the first 90 pages and then the last 10.  To each her own.  Kinda creepy.  No, very creepy.
B00005NB8K|1.0|Brando's BRILLIANT quote from APOCALYPSE NOW (itself a BRILLIANT example of the use of POPULAR music in movies through its use of The Doors \\"THE END\\") was the FIRST thing that came to mind for the title of this review.  As a BORN AGAIN Doors fan (as in, I was a fan as a kid and recently 're-discovered' them), I felt a moral obligation to warn people against this ATROCITY!  If it were possible, I would DESTROY all available copies to protect the INNOCENT and UNASSUMING!    First, the title, \\"THE DOORS,\\" is MISLEADING.  Instead, it should have been called \\"MORRISON.\\"  Stone sees Morrison as THE central figure in The Doors saga, with the OTHERS being merely BACK-UP players.  NOTHING could have been FURTHER from the TRUTH.  Morrison himself would've attested to that.  As proof, the band shared songwriting credits on most songs, attesting to the true COLLABORATIVE nature of this band.    Second, EVERYONE, including Morrison, comes off a a TWO dimensional character in this film.  John Densmore (horribly portrayed by one-note actor Kevin Dillon) is ALWAYS sulking.  Ray Manzarek comes across SO straight-laced (?) as to practically be a MARTINET, and poor Pamela Courson, as played by Meg Ryan, comes across as some STUPID hippy-dippy chick.    Third, Kilmer's perfomance as Morrison is SO overrated.  He portrays Morrison as this VACUOUS, SELF-CENTERED ego maniac, as opposed to the flesh and blood artist that he was, full of CONTRADICTIONS and COMPLEXITIES.    Fourth, Stone uses Morrison's ACTUAL song lyrics in place of dialogue, which comes across as BAD as it sounds, while the remaining dialogue is as CHEESY as it gets (i.e.: ROBBY KRIEGER: \\"All I know is, I played with Dionysius.\\")  Oh, puh-leeze!!    For both old fans/new fans, and those curious to learn about the phenomena that was THE DOORS, I HIGHLY recommend Tom DiCillo's \\"WHEN YOU'RE STRANGE.\\"  It's there that you'll discover that The Doors were a BAND, not \\"Jim Morrison and...\\"  You'll also discover that there reallywas no NEED for anyone to PLAY \\"Jim Morrison\\".  Jim Morrison was \\"playing\\" him all along, and NO ONE could have played him better.  It's like asking someone to play CARY GRANT!    If a MOVIE had to be made about The Doors, ANY filmmaker could've mined (and STILL can) the RICH territory of what happens when a band achieves MASSIVE success through a hit single like \\"LIGHT MY FIRE,\\" and thus become teeny-bopper idols, when they'd rather explore the UNKNOWN through songs like \\"THE END\\" and be taken seriously by a more MATURE audience.  Now THAT would've made a film even former film student Jim Morrison would enjoyed!    p.s.:  for examples of rock bio films that have done it RIGHT, I submit the following for those LUCKY enough NOT to have seen them yet.  Enjoy!    1. THE BUDDY HOLLY STORY (1978) - Gary Busey's finest role, captures the early spirit of this 'new' thing called rock and roll perfectly!    2. LA BAMBA (1987) - Corny, but EFFECTIVE, film about pioneering rock star Ritchie Valens.  Cliched?  yes, but damn, it works!  And in the end, when Santo and Johnny's \\"SLEEPWALK\\" plays through the scene of a flashback of two brothers, running through an open field in carefree ecstasy, not knowing the TRAGEDY to come, I DARE you not to be moved!    3. BACKBEAT (1994) - BEST film about the Beatles yet.  Not as UNTOUCHABLE, PERFECT rock gods, but as AMBITIOUS, DETERMINED young men, doing what they have to do to grab that GOLDEN ring.  Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison?  FORGET that.  Try Ian Hart as John Lennon.  positively CHILLING!
B008IJTFYW|3.0|I can't give it anymore than 3 stars.  its useful, free and has a good amount of sound options BUT the pause in the loops really takes away from any meditation or sleeping you'll do.  if there was no pause it would be an easy 5 star.  dev fix pauses in rain/night sounds like that and I'll re-review.  thanks!

B008NA3HZ4|3.0|The technical quality was splendid.  The story line was not.  It was very slow for the most part, very moody, and in the end seemed pointless.  The very, very best thing about this movie was the full frontal, totally nude scene of Michelle and Sarah in the shower after their water aerobics session.  That was the only FFN for Sarah, but there were quite a few by Michelle, who has to be the most daring top movie star.  Michelle, whether clothed or not, is gorgeous.  Beautiful face, figure and legs.  Did she arouse me?  Absolutely, but as comedian Redd Fox once said, \\"When I stop being a dirty old man, I will be a dead old man.\\"  Michelle is simply drop dead beautiful and very talented.  Why the Seth Rogin character, who played her husband, was more interested in different ways to cook chicken than making out with Michelle, is beyond belief.  I gave it a 3 out of 5 score, because as a movie, it deserved a 1, but as a loving look at Michelle, it deserves at 100 out of 5.

0345803485|1.0|A co worker of mine just ranted and raved about this book.  So like a fool I ran out and bought the trilogy.  I struggled to read 200 pages of the first book and never made it to the end.  It was so boring and there were times when I almost went to sleep while reading it.  I can't understand how this book has managed to sit on the National Bestsellers List for so long.

1469984202|5.0|Hey Mr Howey, you said you read these so I'm writing to you. :-) Wool Omnibus was a great read start to finish and exactly what I needed. I went out of my way to not read any spoilers, opinions, and didn't even want to see the covers of the later books before I read them. Gizmodo turned me on to the title I must admit. I wanted to get lost in the story I knew nothing about, to fool myself into thinking I could guess where the story was going but then end up pleasantly surprised when I was wrong. You took great care to not let the story take predictable turns and I very much appreciated that. I was surprised over and over again. I also appreciate how you didn't feel compelled to explain every detail and every transition. Sometimes time just passes and certain things had been happening for a while. We didn't need to know they got there necessarily. You expect your readers to pay attention and be able to draw certain conclusions. Well done on the nail-biting sequences building tension and suspense. I'll be going on to the 6th book for sure and will follow later iterations. I can't wait to see what's in store for our heroine, her friends, and look forward to the MOVIE. Very nice job.
0345803507|5.0|There are some things that will never change between Christian and Anastasia, but it is for the good of both of them.<br /><br />In fact, some of the stunts that Ana pulls and go against and defy Christian's wishes for Ana's well-being are in an effort to protect him.  Ana's intuitiveness, or sixth sense per say, that keep her from being harmed quite a few times makes for a VERY angry husband, as he feels like he has lost control, and questions his better judgement.  On those couple of occasions, that could have harmed Ana more seriously than she was, had she told Christian the dire situation she was facing, would have resulted  (through his brazen and irrational behavior out of love) in the harm of others, and other loved ones.<br /><br />However, his love cannot go unnoticed. He has come a long way from being a troubled child (circumstantial) to being a loving husband.  Although he has had a hard time growing emotionally, (which is outline in all three books) his control tendencies (a result of his past) are, in his way, in an effort to protect the ones he loves and that are nearest and dearest to his heart.<br /><br />In an effort to keep the integrity of the storyline, and find more surprises, twists and terms the couple endures in their \\"kinky\\" adventures-if you read the first two books and loved them, read on.  This book is as surprisingly good as the second, and the author has really created a visual aide through her writing in all three books. Again, if you liked the first two books, then read this one. E.L. James \\"AIMS TO PLEASE.\\".  Enjoy your reading endeavors, and for now- \\"Laters Readers.\\"
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a great book. I am no literary critic so I do not really care if people criticized the writing style, but I am educated and it did not bother me one bit. While the series is controversial due to the graphic and somewhat disturbing sexual encounters, in context to the story, the sex scenes were not as bad as people make it out to be, you just have to get to know the characters enough to find the meanings behind what is going on. I absolutely loved the story, and I wish there were more than 3. I have recommended this book to all of my friends.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Being the kind of guy that reads 125-150 books a year I have little time to write reviews. This one deserves it though. Extremely well written, as the plot unfolds you see the twists that you expect and then when it is halfway unraveled he throws you a curveball that blows you away. In the post Eddings-Brooks era of fantasy, (you can substitute other writers from that time that you think are better, but then you would be wrong) Mr Ryan has created the best overall book outside of Brent Weeks Night Angel Trilogy and the beginning of the Lightbringer Trilogy. Time and the finishing of the series will tell who is better. This is a much easier read than than Weeks is because it is much less complex with the number of stories being told, although it still captures many of the nuances that Mr Weeks has perfected. Definitely the best book I've read this year, beating out the Kobalos trilogy. I really hate that I got this deep into the review before thinking of the best comparison, the Riyria series by Michael Sullivan, more adult in content and language but a very good comparison.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I absolutely loved this series. Its complex and intriguing, and just when you think you have things figured out, there is a shocking and unexpected twist. I could not stop reading, and I cannot wait for George R.R. Martin to finish the series. I also think buying the first four books grouped together was a great deal!
0345803493|3.0|I enjoyed this book better than the last one. It was great to finally understand why Christian is the way he is and to see him open up more and more with Ana. The interaction between the two have yet to disappoint me. I also liked how Ana blossomed more with him as well, and with that was able to stand on her own two feet in all aspects of her life, though I have to say that I still find her a bit monotone. There were some fantastic plot twists and I found myself not being able to put the book down. I still have some issue with the whole erotic/BDSM aspect to this (see my review for Fifty Shades of Grey), but for someone that doesn't read these kind of books much it wouldn't matter. I do have to give kudos to the author for making the second book better than the first.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it!  I don't know why people say they dislike it.  And the reason why they keep crashing is because they etheir are not moving their finger far enough or they aren't pressing hard enough.  Just saying.
0345803507|3.0|This was a nice end to the trilogy. I liked it more than the other books. I still found Ana monotone and think she has the personality of a wet mop, but not as bad as before. I think the author finally started finding her voice in Ana, but it was a little late in the trilogy. I wish she'd known Ana like she knew Christian. I think then the trilogy would have stood out more. Christian was, as usual, his lovable and over protective self. I enjoyed seeing him open up more. The author has done an excellent job with this character. Since the author seems to know Christian better than Ana, I would have loved to read the trilogy from his point of view rather than from Ana's POV. I still stand by what I said in my review of Fifty Shades of Grey concerning the BDSM and Erotic Romance titles given to these books. I also need to say that while I liked the trilogy, I still don't see what the fuss is about. I've read better books in the BDSM/Erotic Romance genres years before these books were written.
034580404X|5.0|The best set of books I have ever read, fell love with wchristiagrey every woman that loves a romance book should readthis
0345803485|2.0|This book was interesting for being a fan fiction to start with. The author's writing in first person didn't bother me because I'm used to reading other first person books, but what did was the monotone sound that Ana had when she wasn't talking to another character. It's like the author forgot to give her a personality beyond what we see in conversations and interactions with her friends. I will say that she really did a fine job of creating Christian's character. He is truly a flawed hero, who in his own way is crying out for help though he doesn't see it. Christian is strong, demanding, very sexual and slightly pompous, but given the hints we get at his back ground, those things fit him well. I will have to agree with a few others here about this being considered BDSM and erotic. While everything done in the book had a BDSM feel to it, it lacked in that department. The erotic parts were that, but when after being with Christian the first few times and the only thing Ana can thing of saying when talking about her sex was, \\"down there\\", well that was just annoying. I understand that she was innocent when she first met him, but there are better terms available to use to describe where than just those two words and the term \\"my sex\\". With all that being said, the interaction between Ana and Christian is what drew me in. The way the author wrote them together and their interactions was wonderful. With a little more time and polishing, this story could have really shined.

0307949508|2.0|Since English is not my native language I may not be the most competent person to write about proper English narrative. This book, however, is so poorly written it gives me a toothache to read it. I'm not sure if it is the author's, or the translator, Reg Keeland's fault, but surely Random House could have done a better job presenting this book's English version to the public. Many phrases read so awkwardly, it makes me wonder if they used Google Translator to do the job.<br />It ain't no smooth DeMille for sure :-)

B007SYWFRM|3.0|Ice Age is fun......when it works.....each update seems to create new glitches including operating issues and increased prices on everything!  The last update crashed my Kindle Fire and completely wiped out my village....so now....instead of level 36....I am level 9 because I had to start over.  I also lost objects I had paid real money for.  If you play...its fun....no energy points to worry about to complete activities.....but don't get attached to anything and anticipate lots and lots and lots of glitches!!!!!
B00821BLX4|4.0|I love many things about this camera. I'm actually a \\"real\\" pro photographer who shoots all Canon pro equipment. I heard about this camera on a pod cast and was very excited from the get go. I was looking at many smaller options to travel with or as recreational usage. A nice alternative to carrying my DSLR and its accessories. I even looked at the micro 4:3 cameras because of the compact size and lens options. Then the TG-1 was announced. This was a no brainer as long as the image quality was good. Which it is... It works great underwater so far. I'm going to Hawaii next week and can't wait to shoot it in the ocean while snorkeling.  The under water video footage looks almost better than the stills. I'm so excited to travel light in the camera department. The only thing that really bums me out is that I have been waiting for the teleconverter lens since the release of the camera. It's still on back order and I won't have it for my trip next week which was my major deciding factor in buying this actual camera. It's a good thing I bought the fish eye and adaptor ASAP! But now I won't be shooting any nice portraits with a compressed blurred out background because Olympus dropped the ball on the accessories dept. Not good! Don't release waterproof stuff at the end of summer... I know that all of the main pro shops here in the bay area stopped carrying Olympus because they ALL said \\"Olympus stopped releasing anything good\\". When this camera came out the big proshop in Palo Alto CA. finally broke down and started selling it due to the high demand. Now that everyone is waiting for the accessories to be available again or even released. They have already grown tired of waiting for Olympus to catch up again....Otherwise as a point and shoot the camera is pretty cool. User features are awesome and abundant. The fish eye lens looks cool but doesn't seem to be a true fish eye but more of a \\"wide angle\\" look. Probably won't actually buy the zoom lens now either. If you are looking for a underwater camera and don't need the additional lenses there are some cheaper options with probably better image quality.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Games are fun for temporary use.  Will continue to play for now, might get better with the more games I buy.
B005D0RDO8|2.0|I bought this movie because it keep on popping on several forums and being described as masterpiece. In my opinion it is not. There is no real story line, it just shows how sick and perverted some people are and having the power to fulfill them. The fame of this film is because it got pull-out theaters for being too graphic; but that was back in the 70s, now days I have seen films that are more graphic than this one. It just goes to show how time has change.<br /><br />If you saw the film back when it was in theaters (the 70s), then buy it. It might be of your taste. But if you were born after the 70s (like me), then you may not find it not worth buying. Just rent it.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I already knew this workout would be a challenge and I must say that my expectations were definitely met.  From day one, the very first workout left me feeling like all the previous exercises/workouts that I had done before just were baby steps, literally.  My abs look more defined than they ever have and I feel amazing all over.  I am only on circuit 1 right now and I don't believe I\\"m quite ready to move on to the next level. It's not too challenging for a beginner like myself.  It's not easy by any means but if it were easy, what kind of results could I really expect to achieve and keep?  I would definitely recommend.

B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game is to Sci-Fi what Tolkien's the Hobbit is to Fantasy. It is one of the most perfect examples of Sci-Fi.<br />I love its mix of historical influences. One common complaint is that 6yr olds would never be used this way. Go back to the Spartans of Greece. At age 6 they were taken from thier families and trained brutally.<br />The greatness is in the depth of char. of Ender.<br /><br />This is a book I come back to time and time again. It is worth reading. It is even worth getting a paper edition. : )
B005LAII3U|3.0|Remaking a classic film (even if it's only a cult classic) can be a strange business: if it isn't broke, why fix it?  That's the logic that applies to the newest iteration of Arnold Schwarzenegger's sci-fi classic, \\"Total Recall.\\"<br /><br />During the twenty second century in the aftermath of a devastating chemical war, the two remaining nations on earth exist in an uneasy state of underground warfare and terrorism.  Among it all, factory worker Douglas Quaid seeks to find meaning in his boring, tedious life.  Desiring to obtain some artificial memories of a more exciting life, Quaid quickly finds himself thrust into a world of war, intrigue, and where nothing is as it seems.<br /><br />What really sets this modern \\"Recall\\" apart from the original is that it features a more serious, gritty approach to the nearly-identical storyline (which means no witty one liners, trips to Mars, or mutated belly-aliens).  And yet, that's not a bad thing, as it makes for a unique telling of the story, complete with a few welcome changes (Quaid's wife gets a much bigger role, and I found the idea of two continents connected by a massive elevator very interesting).  The production design is also fantastic, combining the visual look of Minority report, the Fifth Element, and Blade Runner, with lots of futuristic tech filling the screen, and delighting the eyes.<br /><br />Still, for all its visual powers, \\"Recall\\" doesn't feel like it has much weight to it: it's mainly an action movie, with the fascinating \\"Who am I?\\" plot playing second fiddle.  Most of the film is devoted to seemingly endless chase scenes among futuristic grey buildings and streets, with almost no humor or moments of levity, which gives the impression that the film takes itself a little too seriously.<br /><br />In the end, \\"Total Recall\\" is a good example of a middle of the road remake.  It does distinguish itself from what came before with a more serious tone, superb visuals, and a very creative climax.  While nota classic, it's serviceable, and an interesting take on the original classic.

B006ZCWTXS|5.0|This is one of those rare albums where you can listen from start to finish and the whole album leaves you feeling refreshed and in awe of what beauty people are capable of.  Rebecca Ferguson is full of soul.  I stumbled onto this album and found out she was a contestant on the British X Factor.  My wife and I watched her progress through the show on You-tube with the judges reactions.  It was very enjoyable to see her evolve from her nervous and tearful audition (where her voice carried her through) to a her final performances where she was radiating with self confidence and blew away the audience and judges.  Heaven makes the most of her remarkable voice.  She is a rare talent and I hope she gives us many more albums in the future.
B007SAKY42|5.0|If you're going to buy more than two of Blur's re-released albums, then just buy this box set.  I made the mistake of buying 4 of them individually (since I already had a few on vinyl, one fake...beware the white vinyl on Modern Life is Rubbish!).  The work and depth of the package of each LP is more than worth the price of admission.<br /><br />Is Blur the best band of my generation?  No, Nirvana is...but Blur is second.  If you have a record player, buy this.  If you don't have a record player, buy this...then buy a record player.  I can only guess the price of this box-set will increase exponentially in value.
B008764ZQ4|5.0|If you like 80's music but occasionally enjoy a new spin on the original recordings, you will enjoy this album.  Much as I really did NOT like the movie from which this soundtrack came, I must say that its various performers (led by Tom Cruise) did an admirable job (the one notable exception being Alec Baldwin: I am not a fan of his, OR of his voice -- but fortunately he doesn't sing much in the movie).  Anyway, listen to the sample clips -- and enjoy a little trip back in time : )

B007VUA7VO|5.0|I have installed several battery apps before this one, but Battery HD takes the gold in my opinion. With a large, easily understandable, streamlined display, options to set battery level alerts, set if by voice or noise, show battery charge in menu, and even open up the app when plugging it in, this app is the most versitile yet. It even lets you see a history of charge level, and smaller details like battery charge and device temperature. All in all, this is an app I would reccommend for everyone

B002TVQ4HG|3.0|The movie seems to deal primarily with the story of a young mother Jess with a young autistic son Tommy and the tragedy she seems desperately to change but is ultimately doomed to fail.  For some reason in the movie we see Jess at the beginning going onto a yacht with five others for a seemingly relaxing cruise but after a storm the passengers are left adrift with seemingly no hope until they see a ship and feel they have been rescued but they are sadly mistaken as the ship is apparently deserted with only the passengers of the yacht on board.  Like with these movies you'll get the usual scares and thrills of what appears to be of supernatural origins, but as the movie progresses we see that isn't just the case.  The acting for the most part is decent not the greatest but overall not bad.  The movie seems to want to convey the hope but ultimately utter futility of trying to change the choices or actions of the past that have lead to either dire consequences or tragedy. The movie is probably worth getting if you pay $10.00 dollars or less anymore and it might feel overpriced...

0525478817|5.0|The Fault in our Stars is a novel above life. It also involves love. Isn't it wonderful, when someone comes along and restores your faith in true love? Not the true love of fairy tales, or the true love of an angst-y teenage novel involving vampires or werewolves or suicidal star-crossed lovers, but true love meaning love which is true: Deep and honest and not really perfect yet endlessly perfect and infinite caring for another person which is, has to be, must be truly felt by some person towards some other person and reciprocated.<br /><br />I began reading The Fault in our Stars at around midnight last night. I finished it at 6.00 this morning.<br /><br />It is beautiful. I look upon the world with more joy and gladness than I did yesterday. It messed with my emotions, made me laugh and cry and crushed me and elated me, just as every truly great book should. The style is so easy and natural that it is impossible not to lose yourself in the beauty of the novel.<br />The skill and depth of the author, whose imaginings and philosophies have touched me and encouraged me and changed my outlook on the world, amaze me. I firmly believe that Hazel's story (and Augustus' and Isaac's and Hazel's Mom's and Dad's and Peter Van Houten's stories) will stay with me for the rest of my life, having given me a fresh appreciation of the universe.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This THE WORST book I have ever read. The characters are unrealistic and ANNOYING. I don't know who's worse, Christian, the 27 year old billionaire who is a concert pianist, and a pilot, or Ana, the idiot naive 22 year old virgin who all of a sudden got turned out by this guy. There's no way in hell a virgin is gonna go for all the kinky crap he was into.<br /><br />The book has no plot at all. I must say when I first started reading it, I was ok. But as I went on, I realized nothing was going to happen. I was like \\"wait...this is actually it\\". It's just sex, sex, and more sex. I mean sex is fine, but good god, there's only so many times you want to read about the same crap. This book is just made up of blushing, inner goddesses, foil packets, and lip biting. So ridiculous.<br /><br />I couldn't get through the book. The writing is TERRIBLE. For people who don't know what a really well written book is like, I can see them thinking this is good. Thank god I didn't buy it. I would have demanded my money back. Complete rubbish.
0553582038|3.0|I have read every single word in this Tome.  The entire story could have been condensed into two or three hundred pages.  It is filled -- stuffed actually -- with trivial descriptions of clothing, food, and unnecessary descriptions to the point where the events themselves are lost or at least buried.  New characters are introduced which only adds to the confusion.  The storyline is evolving into a soap opera with each chapter ending with a cliff hanger, but nothing is ever resolved.  After reading all 900+ pages I find nothing ever happens and nothing is concluded.  Furthermore you are left with the assumption you will read the next book although it seems that isn't going to resolve anything either.  Apparently there is to be a sixth book.  I may or may not read number six because I am still undecided about tackling another pointless thousand pages of detail and trivia promised by book 5.  The entire storyline and plot has gotten so complex and convoluted that it is almost impossible to follow all of the characters, their locations, their motivations, and even who they are exactly.
B0081L37Z0|1.0|Movie could have been ok (only ok) if the script writer knew any words other than F!@#, &$*$, $##, !@@@!#,**^^%@@. Totally ruined the whole movie. Don't waste your time with this movie.

0307341550|3.0|I do like this author; She will drag you in and hold your attention - even when I thought the book was predictable, It was not a \\"labor\\" to finish it.  I like her style of writing and especially like her use of similies:<br /><br />\\"My mother's voice swept high and raw, like a red scarf in a storm\\".  She is very good<br />at the similie writing, she probably writes poetry (but I digress).<br /><br />The sister Amma really bothered me...whose child is this out of control?  I was beginning to think it was a teen horror story. But I realized that this was a dysfunctional family with a captial \\"D\\". I was distrubed by this thirteen year old.<br /><br />Sharp Objects was kinda disappointing (having read Gone Girl which is brilliant).<br />This author can take the reader on a horrific ride.  It was an okay read.  I'm gonna read<br />her again.

0452273331|5.0|The best work of fiction I believe I have ever read. Rand was ahead of her time in her portrayal of Howard Roark, who fought to pioneer FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT-style architecture, while everyone around him told him \\"We have always done it this way\\" as they attempted to force him into their stagnant and \\"safe\\" box of convention. An inspiring and epic tale of one man's struggle for artistic independence and freedom. A classic, and one to read again and again. Brilliant.
B004GJDQT8|1.0|Would be super great if it worked with my Optimus V, but it don't. It installs and looks like it will work but when you go to scan barcode, there is a black screen. The app is still running but looks like there is no camera connection. It shows the green box and red line like normal but on black screen. The same thing happens on Amazon Student app. and Amazon Pricecheck app. - All show black screens when try to scan barcodes. Don't get me wrong, I love the app when it worked on my other phone, but I just got a new Optimus V and what do I have to do to get it to work. I don't want to go buy another phone. I know it isn't my phone cause I use other scanner apps and they all work fine. The problem seems to be on amazon apps that scan barcodes. I haven't had any problems with other apps, just amazons. This is the reason for one star, If fixed, I would rate 5 star, if it worked properly.
0486275590|5.0|Had a great time reading this book to my whole family as we drove across the country this Summer!  It was a much anticipated re-read for my husband and a first time read for the rest of us.  It is a classic for a reason!  Funny to think about a fast food chain with Long John Silver for its name sake, even if he was a seemingly amiable sort of guy.

1936608898|5.0|This book is a must-read for anyone who takes an interest in good nutrition.  I have been reading books on nutrition for years. Many of those nutrition books were written by very authoritative authors on the subject, yet many/most contradicted one another. It was very frustrating! I would buy into one school of thought only to find it was not effective with me, so I'd try another with the same result.  My understanding was fragmented bits and pieces of knowledge that really didn't all fit together. It didn't make sense.  Dallas and Melissa Hartwig basically just painted one big, easy to understand picture.  Now I get the total body interaction with each thing I ingest. It makes sense. Their book ties up all the loose ends, and makes you WANT to eat healthy.  But wanting to eat healthy is the first step. Once you actually start the Whole30 plan, then you start to see the genious behind it. You lose weight, sleep better and feel better.  It really is not a crazy, painful dietary shift. You finally open your eyes to all the crap that is in the easy to get foods, and start seeking out healthy options. I have recommended this book to all of my friends, and for those who have taken the time to read it, I frequently get the same response, \\"I finally get it!\\"
B004K4IZ3G|3.0|If you like the 3D like I do the stuff that comes out of the screen then get this in regular 2 D its cheaper that way, This has a mixture of 2D with 3D this is another one of them depth perception 3D movies but only while he is in the \\"Game\\" My reasoning for the 3 Stars is because of the type of 3D effects which are very limited
B006LSZECO|3.0|The idea behind this novel is great; I love a good mystery. However, I found it hard to get through the first half of the book. Most of the intrigue and action takes place in the second half. I was also disappointed in the ending. Overall, I would recommend this book, perhaps other readers will have different opinions.

B006LSZECO|3.0|It is what it is - this year's big beach book for readers who are sick of the Gishams and Pattersons, readers who want a thriller with \\"ideas.\\"<br /><br />It's a fast, fun read, with vivid characters, although the upper-crust crowd seemed a little stagey to me; the \\"trashy\\" characters felt more real.<br /><br />There is a definate retro vibe to the storytelling, maybe because it is completely psychological - no blood or gore, here - maybe because it reminded me of Ira Levin's better thrillers, Rosemary's Baby or The Stepford Wives. The tone here is adamantly post-feminist, but the basic questions echo. What is my role? and Why does it feel so fake?<br /><br />To this, Flynn cannily adds: How can I trust you if I can't trust myself?<br /><br />Ultimately, I wanted less soap and more murders, but I enjoyed it
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Supernatural is the best TV show and has been since season 1. Can't wait to see what season 8 has in store for us fanboys :D
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|I have been a Donna Summer fan for years on end. As my life progressed, I lost touch with a lot of her work and, I am ashamed to say overlooked the high quality of songs that are in Crayons, even though it was in my collection. After her passing, I listened to several of her CD's that I did not take time to soak in the words and music. This collection is superb beyond belief.<br /><br />My personal stand outs are Crayons, I'm A Fire, Slide Over Backwards. The title track is so uplifting in the delivery. From the togetherness of the lyrics to the jump up and be happy of the rhythm and beats, it is a crowd pleaser and I would have love to have seen Ziggy Marly and Donna perform this song. I'm a Fire is traditional dance Diva's groove. Every time I listen to the song I see Summer performing before a live audience while flying over them on a high wire stinging her to and fro. Slide Over Backwards puts me in the old southern Juke Joint atmosphere. Can't you hear Shug Avery, from Color Purple, singing this song?<br /><br />I absolutely love this CD and recommend it HIGHLY. I am even willing to spearhead a petition to have it re-released. I bet any amount of money it would sell a lot more than it did when it was first released.
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|The app is fine for creating documents. My problem with the app is that it always wants to be running in the background, and for some reason, that process seems to be a major battery drainer.
1451608659|5.0|This story is great! Dominique has had an eventful life and this well-written book will draw you in almost immediately to her life, her sister's and the true commitment of young gymnasts striving to make the Olympic Team.<br /><br />Some have mentioned how disappointed they were with the flow of the book. This did not bother me at all. I even liked it. I've found this style in a few other books I have read recently and in particular with stories that have something shocking to share. Most know before they pick up the book what the climax will be. The writer tells that part first, so you can relax and really take in the rest of the story without so much anticipation to get to the \\"good part\\". I also felt like by starting with the present and going back to the past, she left so much more room for a more unfamiliar climax which brought its own anticipation.<br /><br />I finished the book feeling inspired by both her and Jennifer (and Christina). They all seemed to have beautiful hearts and are now very much at peace with the difficult situations life has thrown at them. I feel a message is given to parents as well, which reminds us no matter how much we love our kids, we aren't perfect and things can become disasterous very quickly if we get \\"off balance\\". I really felt for her dad. He made huge mistakes, but he did love her very much, I believe.

B008N1LL42|5.0|The problem I see with film critics is they actually try to break down a film such as this as if it was going to be submitted to the Academy for Oscar consideration.  I understand why many producers are withholding their films from critics until they are in theaters because they can just massacre a film to the point where no one will go and see it. I critique every film I watch with just one question- \\"Was it entertaining?\\"  In the case of Battleship- YES it was entertaining!  It doesn't have an intricate plot, just a beginning, middle and end. It doesn't have award winning dialogue. No huge list of A-list actors. But these factors do not have to be in place to create a fun flick. The CGI was awesome, the actors did their jobs, I didn't have to stay on my toes for the next plot twist, and with Peter Berg directing you will not be let down if all you want is a couple hours to sit back, relax and watch a great popcorn action flick.  Just reading the title alone will tell you what kind of film you will be watching. And I don't get the whole \\"based on the board game\\" thing. From what has been said, it was one of the reasons it did not do well at the box office.  I don't even remember a reference to the game, nobody said \\"You sunk my battleship!\\" or anything like that! These types of \\"rotten\\" rated films will always be a part of my Blu-Ray collection and Battleship is no exception. Every movie is worth at least one look! I am not a film critic hater but please don't take just their opinion to the bank. I read all the reviews just for giggles and I went and seen it anyway. Read reviews from people like the other folks on this page, good or bad because we are the ones who understand the concept of \\"suspension of disbelief\\". Read the review from \\"Darth Maciek\\", that's who we should be listening to!

B0011UF79C|4.0|Not a five-ster film, but you can do a lot worse than spending a couple of hours with Gattaca.  As with most sci-fi you're required to check your common sense at the door, but that's part of the fun of it.  If you've ever found yourself rooting for the underdog you should enjoy this one.  I found it tugged on a couple of my heartstrings.  See it.

B008645YEE|4.0|\\"Here you see the essence of Hans' approach,\\" writes director Chris Nolan in the liner notes of this CD. \\"He is not playing along...Hans sees through the screen to the dark beating heart of the story.\\" The whole note is worth reading, about what Hans Zimmer has contributed to Nolan's groundbreaking vision of the Batman story, and specifically to this final film: 'The Dark Knight Rises.'<br /><br />And Nolan is right. From the beginning the Batman scores have eschewed the bombastic themes of most superhero movies and stuck with the idea of the Batman - the absence of theme, expressing instead the character itself, the dark undercurrent that creeps under everything, swelling and fading and - in this story - rising to meet the ultimate evil.<br /><br />Zimmer's score for 'The Dark Knight Rises' is almost everything you could hope for, flowing naturally from the familiar themes of the first two films into uncharted territory with new threats and new characters. The menace of Bane expressed in raw, primal rhythms, the bright dance of the cat burglar, the subtle notes of introspection, the progression from the dark, rising to the light. It's not easy to pick a favorite song - while these themes pervade the entire score, \\"Imagine the Fire\\" somehow captures them all in a single sequence, rising and falling, bright strings and edgy synth and pounding drum. This song alone is worth the price of admission for this score.<br /><br />And despite how good it is, how well it meets the challenge the movie presents, Zimmer's score for 'The Dark Knight Rises' is missing something. It's missing the balance of James Newton Howard's fine touch. While it's probably accurate to say that Howard's contribution was less than Zimmer's in the previous two movies, its absence is felt here. 'Dark Knight Rises' is all Zimmer, and you can hear it - there's hints of 'Black Rain' here, and echoes of 'Gladiator'. Missing, though, is the subtlety and balance of Howard's touch, and after the first two masterpieces, I can't help but think this would have been an even better score with him included.<br /><br />That being said, I still love it. It's a perfect match for the movie and it's delightful to listen to in its own right. If you're in any doubt, just take a few minutes and give \\"Imagine the Fire\\" a test drive - listen to the dark beating heart of the story and let it rise, rise, rise.masterpieces, I can't help but think this would have been an even better score with him included.<br /><br />That being said, I still love it.

B003HV0TN2|5.0|I first picked up this book out of mere curiosity at the local book shop and read it over the summer holidays. What I found inside was totally unexpected. Yes the story can be slow but I personaly like a book that builds on the little things bit by bit. The hero Kvothe is very beliveable even though he is more intelligent than I will ever be. When he fails in an endevor he learns from it and grows wiser as a result. The reader is not just reading about a person in a book. They are growing alongside with Kvothe.The world of stories, music and magic is well created with a good creation story to act as something to keep in the back of the readers mind as they keep flicking the pages. I personaly loved it and I managed to get my grandmother hooked on these books as well. This is well worth your money belive me.
B002RUA524|4.0|This autobiographical novel retains the freshness and wonder of the gaze of a child who finds himself thrust from rainy and cold England to a warm, teeming with life Greek island.  Here, thanks to the peculiarity of his family and their acquaintances, the boy can give free rein to his passion for the discovery of nature. The book is very pleasant to read and sometimes genuinely funny. Although the writing is lively and fresh, it doesn't prevent the narration to become slightly repetitive and boring after a while.

0439023491|4.0|There is a tendency to take pop fiction too seriously but if it touches you, if it moves you then there is no limit as to where your emotions might go. Catching Fire is the second or middle book of the Hunger Games series. While the first book sets the stage for the world of Panem, Catching Fire lights that world ablaze with hardships. After a relatively painless recap, expectations are met and exceeded pulling you headlong into a story that moves far beyond the plight of a couple teenagers from District 12.<br /><br />I might be reading too far much into this but Catching Fire seemed to me an homage to the works of Kurt Vonnegut as he described and condemned the actions taken at Dresden in World War two. The overt destruction demonstrates the dangers of what an all powerful government can do if given full reign. Perhaps a new generation of readers will take this subtle lesson to heart. Hopefully we will never have to find out if the message got through.
B0085776BG|4.0|Redtails dramatizes racial prejudice and the power to overcome it during WWII.  The men of the Redtail squadron in 1944 Italy fight not only the Germans, but also the prejudice of their white comrads in arms.  The visual action effects are done rather well by George Lucas' team of computer graphics artists.  It's difficult to see any major differences between real filmed and computer generated graphics scenes.  I wish there had been more action scenes since they were done so well.  All in all I would call Redtails a great addition to the cinematic heritage.
0312427999|5.0|Such a complete discussion of the mixture of politics and the economy in the USA and by extension the world that tries to contain American capitalism's hunger for cheap labor and expanding markets for a world economy under its direction.

0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games is an action book in a future dystopian society where a young girl named Katniss Everdeen  is chosen to compete in a fight to the death contest with teenagers from other districts.  The selection process for the contestants is reminiscent of  that in Shirley Jackson's short story \\"The Lottery.\\" The scenes depicted of teenagers fighting each other in an island arena may owe some of its inspiration to Battle Royale. Interestingly, the focus of the book is not on the violent episodes, but in Katniss' struggle with her feelings towards two young men and her ambivalence about which one she truly loves.<br /><br />The book is tightly written and keeps readers engaged throughout. Just fair warning, the rest of the trilogy was not what was promised by the excellence of the first book.

B007SAKSF2|3.0|See those 3 stars? Are you wondering why I gave this \\"wonderful\\" collection such a low score? Well, read the following then.<br /><br />This is the \\"definitive\\" collection, supposedly everything the band ever done, every track remastered especially for the set. Well, does it deliver on its promises? ...... Yyyesss, and...... no.<br /><br />The good.<br /><br />This set has more Blur tracks than you ever expected to own. All the b-sides (not really), all the fan club singles (not really), all the demos (worth listening), and all the promotional singles. Also, three DVD's worth of live awesomeness and rare music videos. The book is really nice, with cool photos. And, if you happen to have a turntable, you could play the 7 inch single from the Seymour era.<br /><br />This is where the good ends, and the bad begins...<br /><br />Now things get interesting. Without even listening, you will probably notice something's not right, just by looking at the tracklist. I Know is missing, and in its place is the extended mix. WAT. Did they just robbed you out of the regular version and offered the remix instead? Yep! Next, despite having all fan club singles, they omitted Colours. Double WAT. They also did not include the live version of 7 Days, which was released as a b-side to Music Is My Radar Pt. 2 single. WAT. WAT. WAT.<br /><br />So, we have 3 tracks MISSING from this supposedly \\"complete\\" collection. But it gets slightly worse....<br /><br />You remember that all tracks had been remastered specifically for this release, right? Well, they were. All of them. And that is baaaad. Why? Because drums are now de-emphasized and bass is WAY too loud. Also, through some digital editing they made the sound smoother. And this is a rock band. You might know where I am going with this. In case you don't, this means the guitars now have 20% less power. They do not rock anymore. And remember the part about the bass being too loud? I used to listen to the band's entire albums through headphones with no strain on my ears. Now, I am having trouble listening to several songs without pausing and taking the headphones off. That much bass is too much information for the head. And they are CERTAINLY not going to redo this massive remastering work ever again. THIS is the sound we are stuck with, most likely forever.<br /><br />Okay, I guess it is time to get back to the good...<br /><br />All of the tracks from the 2 exclusive CDs of rarities have their bass just fine, with the possible exception of Never Clever. Also, the mixing in Think Tank album (both discs) is fine as well. The 2 bonus discs are worth 50$ alone. With the book and the CDs being set-exclusive, it justifies the price for a Blur fan (which you are, if you are reading this).<br /><br />However, this set does NOT make your previous Blur collection obsolete. If you have the 10th Anniversary singles collection, KEEP IT; it has the better sound mix and the original I Know. If you have the original UK releases of the albums, keep them as well. But if yours were pressed in the US, I got bad news for you... they sound inferior, possibly due to a copy of the original master being used to make them. That affects the singles as well: if UK - keep, if US - dispose.<br /><br />Alright, I hope I made my points clear: buy the set, enjoy the rarities, sell the studio albums (except Think Tank), keep UK-released Blur stuff you had before. Wow... that's a lot of points...<br /><br />P.S. \\"Leisure\\" and \\"13\\" albums each have a bonus track that is either a fan club single, or only available on a DVD (accordingly).

B0060YIBLK|5.0|Coming from the standpoint of a hobbyist in information security and social engineering I have to give this book five stars. All tho it is not and in depth book in social engineering (SE for short) that dose not negate the quality of this quick read. (For more in depth reading on SE I highly suggest \\"Social Engineering: The Art of Human Hacking by Christopher Hadnagy and Paul Wilson\\")  I would have to say this book is not only a great intro to SE it is also a great book to increase communication skills. The best way I can describe this book is as fallows...<br /><br />I have a coworker who I haven't gotten along with to much from the first time we met. You know when sometimes you meet a person and you both just rub each other the wrong way? Well this WAS the case with my coworker. If not remedied these relationships usely never get resolved and only deteriorate making both persons miserable when around each other. This is not good in a work environment and in life in general. I'm sure you would agree. As I read Robin Dreeke's book of course I wanted to put it in to practice... By using my coworker as a test case I fallowed Robin's examples for engaging people. This is a review so I won't go over the details but needless to say my coworker and I have been getting along much better after working thu this book. Hence the title... \\"It's not all about \\"Me.\\"<br /><br />Another point I would like to make is the writing style. Robin give real world examples from life experiences that keep you going and wanting to read more. As a person who has the proverbial 100 browser tabs open at any given time (A.D.D.) I get bored easy. (I forced my self to read \\"Old Man and the Sea\\" for this reason ha) If a book is not engaging and fast paced unfortunately my interest dissolves quite quickly. On that note this book keeps me going and is an enjoyable read.<br /><br />Concerning the SE side of things I have one point I would like to stress. The book's title \\"IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT \\"ME\\" The Top Ten Techniques for building Quick Rapport with Anyone\\" illustrates my next sentence. Namely the last part...  \\"...for building Quick Rapport with Anyone.\\"<br /><br />In my honest opinion I think this book should be revisited from time to time. I don't know.... I would say about once a year give or take. The reason is the length of the book makes it fit perfectly in to the category of \\"refresher.\\"  I have read many books on SE, NLP, micro expressions and so on. They are all well and good but those books discusses more in depth techniques. This book on the other hand is quick and to the point wile retaining readability. If you read other books on these topic this book will trigger what you read from other related books. I for one need a refresher from time to time to break out of my introverted shell. Reread this I will. He nailed it with the title.<br /><br />I have traveled the entire United Stares several times over. At times I have walked across a few. Besides socks and other items there's not a lot you can carry. I always kept one or two books. I'm older now and I am afforded the luxury of having many books on my kindle, but I'll never forget how I had to pick and choose.  When it comes to SE I have learned these methods the hard way as a matter of survival. In that there is few book I have had in my pack at any given time. There are even few books I will read more than once (A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court and Plato are some of the few I love to revisit) but I must say this book is going on the top shelf and will be reread. I put few books in that category.<br /><br />If your in to SE or just want to increase your communication skills in your daily relationships this book won't let you down.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Raving reviews are all abound but here is another. I dont usually read YA but I could not put this one down. The have and have nots are pitted against each other in a world of reality tv and where the media control minds for the ruling elites. Interesting idea that is done in a smart and engaging way. Great conversation for YA and for those of us against citizens united ruling.

0547569653|5.0|I LOVE this book! For someone who, even a few weeks ago has proclaimed \\"I hate running and wouldn't run unless someone was chasing me with a weapon\\", this is a most inspirational book. Of late I have been talking to acquaintances who are runners (one who actually ran her first marathon in April of this year), and find myself becoming more and more intrigued by the idea of running. When a friend described the \\"runners high\\" it was something I actually want to experience.<br />I am doing all my research (from shoes to proper form) and may very well take up running in the near future. If/when it happens, it will be almost entirely due  to this book.
B005I2YL4G|4.0|I purchased this product in combination with a [[ASIN:B0058GXUKI Gigabyte AMD Socket FM1 Dual Graphic Micro ATX Motherboard GA-A75M-S2V]], a [[ASIN:B0077CR5RK SAMSUNG 830 Series 2.5-Inch 64GB SATA III MLC Internal Solid State Drive (SSD) MZ-7PC064B/WW]], and [[ASIN:B004DDI0IE Kingston Technology HyperX Blu 8GB 1333MHz DDR3 Non-ECC CL9 DIMM (Kit of 2) KHX1333C9D3B1K2/8G]]. For my standard Windows 7 application usage, I am very impressed. My Windows Experience Index is in the 6-7 range, and all of the programs that I run function flawlessly. From a standard productivity viewpoint, I have a very powerful PC at a very low cost. I have not noticed any noise coming from the CPU fan - certainly nowhere near the level of noise that comes from the AMD-81xx CPU's I've owned.<br /><br />As regards productivity I have had no issues with APU performance. All of my office utilities load up lightning fast and I have had no crashes. Driver support is flawless in Windows 7. Just make sure to go online and install the latest drivers / Catalyst software directly from the AMD website; there is no need for third-party driver download software. As regards image software, I use GIMP for graphics editing, and this APU works wonderfully. Web browsing is fast, and DirectX support is up to date. Picasa software works lightning fast - no complaints here.<br /><br />As for videos and entertainment, please note that I am not a gamer. I do watch 720p and 1080p h264 and x264 videos, though. For video encoding and replay the platform has been perfect. I use Handbrake to encode my personal video collection, and while the encoding speed is nowhere as fast as it was on my AMD A8-8120 CPU system it's fine and it usually takes about an hour to encode a 1.5 hour DVD. I watch my 720p and 1080p videos through VLC, and they run seamlessly with no noticable issues.<br /><br />I will point out one thing for Linux fans - I tried to set up a Linux Mint machine utilizing this setup, and the support for the AMD integrated graphics processors is abysmal as of August 2012. There's some Turkish distribution of Linux that supports the Llano APU's because they aren't held to the same copyright / IP laws as the distributions coming from the European or American West. I'm just a little upset at this because for my uses a Linux system would be much more practical.<br /><br />Overall this is a good processor - 65W is a very low power draw, meaning this product runs very cool and utilizes very little electricity for a desktop system. No need for a fancy water-cooled CPU heatsink. If you want to strike a balance between power usage and performance this is an excellent platform. And really, I have no complaints at all using this as a Windows 7 processor. But if I were to start gaming and using some really intensive encoding software, I'd probably go i7 with discrete video and audio.<br /><br />Update as of September 20th, 2012 - a Note to Linux Users<br /><br />After initial frustrations attempting to load various fglrx files and amd-cccle on Linux distributions that proved non-supportive of the integrated graphics capability of this card, I went as far as downloading Turkish Linux (Pardus) because I had heard they natively supported the APU platform. HOWEVER, I was extremely delighted when I installed Ubuntu 12.10 and I was able to boot and reboot and watch my movies and edit my graphics files with no issues - with the occasional (very occasional) bug or purple-screen-boot. The 12.1 release works well, because evidently the Linux Kernel that it is packaged with supports the new AMD APU platform. Now, if I can just get catalyst control center installed I'd be overjoyed! And one final note - if building a system, make sure that you enable in your BIOS (and write to CMOS) that the board access the on-board graphics before a discrete graphics card. Otherwise it'll be black screen no matter what OS you're using!<br /><br />Linux Update - OpenSuse 12.2<br /><br />I had a few bugs with Ubuntu - not many - and switched to OpenSuse which has the KDE desktop (as opposed to Unity). I am using OpenSuse v12.2 now, and it works flawlessly, although I was more accustomed to the Ubuntu interface. I noticed that in general OpenSuse runs more smoothly than the Ubuntu release - and I was encouraged before downloading this new distro when - of all the distro webpages - I saw AMD's logo ONLY on the Opensuse webpage. So that's my take. I have noticed that almost daily the Linux and Xorg communities are getting up to speed with the AMD APU platform, and considering that the Raspberry PI SOIC can run on Linux there is no reason to need a discrete graphics card to have to get a quality GUI and distro to run on an APU based system.

B007PM218K|5.0|John Steinbeck wrote it as he saw it.  Maybe, not the same exact story he knew, but hit the nail on the head as to the way it was.  The reproduction on Blu Ray was a good job as far as I could tell.  I don't know how much technology they have it this time to improve on the old original films, but it seemed like a decent job to me.  In 1940 they could've made it in color.  I suppose they would've, if they knew at that time it would become #21 in America's top 100 all time movie list by the American Film Institute.  I should also mention that John Steinbeck also recieved a Pulitzer Prize in 1940 for the Novel.  He later won a Nobel Peace Prize for his work as an author.  This movie should be in your collection, even if you're not a staunch Movie Fan.
B000Q6GUTI|5.0|Okay, so my review is not your typical movie review. There are plenty of reviews available on Amazon for \\"Shooter,\\" but this movie must be highlighted as one of the steps by which Mark Wahlberg has regained his \\"manliness\\" or screen virility by means of excellent casting strategy / role selection as an actor.<br /><br />First, Mark Wahlberg was a New Kid on the Block. This is akin to being Justin Bieber in the celebrity zeitgeist of 2012. He was a teenage heart-throb for the girls of the '80's, and as male born in the late '70's I had a particular aversion to any VHS video or stereo-cassette where his performances with the \\"New Kids\\" were recorded. My sister, one year my junior, was one of his biggest fans. That may be another reason for the fact that I had a particular distaste for this performer at the time.<br /><br />Transition to 2007: Wahlberg, the hero, stars along aside Danny Glover the the bad guy (total inverse-80's move from \\"Lethal Weapon\\"), where his multi-dimensional and clasically virtuous character displays his keen ability to transition from tween girl crush to dude-crush actor in little over a decade or two. And it just shows us how much times change, and how much certain individuals, such as Glover, can be molded into character actors over time.<br /><br />But if there had to be a first step when Wahlberg started to regain this \\"proof of man card\\" it would be his transition to \\"Marky Mark.\\" Sampling Lou Reed for an original rap song, \\"Wild Side,\\" was a big move that found me oddly interested in this former boy-band member's contributions to popular culture and curiously wondering (as I listened to the cassette single while riding my BMX) how I could find this man's art so outstanding. I didn't realize at the time that I was witness to larger plan, a larger scheme to restore to this fine, talented, gentleman a place in Hollywood history.<br /><br />Time rolled on and opportunity abounded - and Wahlberg began to show his genius through starring roles in movies such as \\"Boogie Nights,\\" \\"Rock Star,\\" and \\"Invincible.\\" His ability to carry these roles and deliver powerful and realistic individuals imbued with character and virility - interestingly - shares a direct inverse relationship to the success in \\"manliness\\" and three-dimensionality of the characters of Matt Damon in his roles over the same years.<br /><br />Long story short is that Mark Wahlberg is a star. Whether casting genius or fine tuning of acting skills through his career - or a combination thereof - he has done an excellent job in most all his films - particularly this one. He has overtaken, in my opinion, Matt Damon, as the virtuous and strong actor known for the \\"Bourne\\" series of films, and he toes the fine line of this very delicate walk. There won't be \\"Chuck Norris\\" jokes about this 21st century actor because as rough-and-tumble and as manly as his roles have been, he doesn't take himself as seriously as Chuck (who oddly, has an apparent resemblance to Dog the Bounty Hunter), as evidenced in \\"The Other Guys\\" when he does his ballet moves.<br /><br />Nothing in modern American film has thrilled me as much as the rise of this actor to his present status, and certainly the films in which he has starred - particulary \\"Shooter\\" - will remain as classics that capture the essence and insecurities of the collective conscience of America in the post 9-11 world. Long story short - excellent script and story, particulary outstanding starring role for Mr. Wahlberg.s in movies such as \\"Boogie Nights,\\" \\"Rock Star,\\" and \\"Invincible.\\" His ability to carry these roles and deliver powerful and realistic individuals imbued with character and virility - interestingly - shares a direct inverse relationship to the success in \\"manliness\\" and three-dimensionality of the characters of Matt Damon in his roles over the same years.<br /><br />Long story short is that Mark Wahlberg is a star.

B001AQO3WY|4.0|Besides the racisim and lack of diversity the series was really good. The show prooved my point that we did more harm than good.
B005LAII3U|5.0|\\"Total Recall\\" is pretty good. This is how the story goes: Welcome to Rekall, the company that can turn your dreams into real memories. For a factory worker named Douglas Quaid, even though he's got a beautiful wife who he loves, the mind-trip sounds like the perfect vacation from his frustrating life - real memories of life as a super-spy might be just what he needs. But when the procedure goes horribly wrong, Quaid becomes a hunted man. Finding himself on the run from the police -controlled by Chancellor Cohaagen, the leader of the free world, Quaid teams up with a rebel fighter to find the head of the underground resistance and stop Cohaagen. The line between fantasy and reality gets blurred and the fate of his world hangs in the balance as Quaid discovers his true identity, his true love, and his true fate.<br /><br />The cast led by Colin Farrell (as Douglas Quaid), Kate Beckinsale (as Lori), Jessica Biel (as Melina) & Bryan Cranston (as Cohaagen) is pretty good. The directing by Len Wiseman is pretty good. The screen story (inspired on or based on the short story \\"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale\\" by Philip K. Dick) by Ronald Shusett, Dan O'Bannon, Jon Povill & Kurt Wimmer & screenplay (inspired on or based on the short story \\"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale\\") by Wimmer & Mark Bomback is pretty good.<br /><br />The music by Harry Gregson-Williams is pretty good. The cinematography by Paul Cameron is pretty good. The film editing by Christian Wagner is pretty good. The casting by Debra Zane is pretty good. The production design by Patrick Tatopoulos is pretty good. The art direction by Patrick Banister, Oana Bogdan & Brandt Gordon is pretty good. The set decoration by Carolyn 'Cal' Loucks, set design by William Cheng, Tucker Doherty, David G. Fremlin, Vladislav Fyodorov, Sorin Popescu, Anshuman Prasad & Douglas Slater, set dressings by Matt Wladyka & Toni Wong is pretty good. The costume design by Sanja Milkovic Hays is pretty good. The stunts coordinated by Andy Gill, Spiro Razatos, John Stoneham Jr., Regan Moore, J.J. Perry, Jude Poyer & Brad Martin is pretty good. The fights coordinated by Jeff Imada & John Koyama is pretty good. The special make-up effects by Kazuhiro Tsuji is pretty good. The prosthetic make-up effects by Jamie Kelman & Sean Sansom is pretty good. The special effects supervised by Laird McMurray, Shane Mahan & Clay Pinney & coordinated by Lindsay MacGowan & John Rosengrant is pretty good. The visual effects supervised by Olivier Cauwet, Peter Chiang, Adrian De Wet, Sean Farrow, Richard Higham, Nathan McGuinness, Aleksandar Pejic & Chris Thomas, coordinated by Ann-Marie Blommaert, Amanda H. Campbell, Ryan Delaney, Stacey Dodge, Richard Enriquez, Judith Gericke, Ross Johnson, Sara Khangaroot, Michelle Kuginis, Lara Lom, Mel Martin, Laura Millward, Edward Randolph, Katie Roehrick, Nidhi Seth, Adrian Steel, Gustav Vallin, Maggie Walby & Yi Yang is pretty good.<br /><br />This is a pretty decently good remake that differs from the original and is not a shot-by-shot retread. This is a well-designed film, visually and artistically. Colin Farrell is a pretty good pick for the role of Douglas Quaid, which was originated by Arnold Schwarzenegger, 22 years previously. As is, Kate Beckinsale & Jessica Biel, replacing Sharon Stone & Rachel Ticotin in the original, 22 years ago. Len Wiseman is also an interesting choice to direct the remake, replacing Paul Verhoeven, 22 years ago, of course.
B00003CXBH|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever made about religion, going far beyond the history lessons and stitled hagiography of many church films, but also transcending the confused humanism and skepticism of many pseudo-sophisticated mainstream films on Christian subjects. Themes of redemption and sacrificial love are at the core of this movie's deep insights into the human person. This film also captures with pitch-perfect sensitivity the Jesuit missionary spirit -- that combination of radical availability, zeal for sharing Christ's love, and willingness to make sacrifices -- that made the Society of Jesus the unshakable and oft-mistrusted bulwark of Catholicism in the post-Reformation era. Several Jesuit priests consulted on the film (including two, Tony Lawn and Daniel Berrigan, who appear as priests in supporting roles in the film itself) and their influence is unmistakable. When you watch this film, there will be no mistaking that this is the religious order of Pope Francis. As Hilaire Belloc once said, if you can hear mass being celebrated in many parts of the world today, it is because the Jesuits gave their lives there. You can feel the spirit of St. Ignatius Loyola lurking behind every frame of this film, moving the viewer to tears of gratitude. This is the rare sort of movie that simultaneously challenges your faith and makes you proud to be a Catholic. From a technical standpoint, the filmmaking may be a bit odd and disjointed in places, but the emotional core of the actors -- along with the astounding visuals and music -- pulls you through and makes everything hold together somehow. Watch it and see.

B00756GKBA|5.0|OK, after hearing a sample of Girl Gone Wild on Amazon, I was prepared to write Madonna off as a Rihanna wannabe. But after watching the video and listening to the housey number in full, I was assured that Madge had reconnected with her sleazy past and wondered if the rest of MDNA was any good.<br /><br />I listened to it at the record store where stacks of the deluxe MDNA were going cheap and was convinced that Madge had gone back to her roots...somewhat.<br /><br />Musically, MDNA is like a rainbow reflecting throwbacks to the 80s and 90s and then some more:<br /><br />1) Give Me All Your Luvin' reminds me of Over And Over. Very upbeat. When Nicki Minaj bellows \\"I'm Conan\\", I can't stop giggling as I keep picturing her as Conan The Barbarian in drag. Love those Conan films. The Party Rock Remix featuring LMFAO is even more of a riot as the duo are Trojan!? LOL.<br /><br />2) Masterpiece invokes I'll Remember and You'll See.<br /><br />3) I'm A Sinner is very Beautiful Stranger - from the Austin Powers film.<br /><br />4) Beautiful Killer. It sounds like Madge tweaked the beginning chords of Die Another Day. Nonetheless, it's a pretty good song. Maybe as the Queen alleged, Lady Gaga borrowed this technique to change Express Yourself into Born This Way.<br /><br />Some surprises here:<br /><br />1) Turn Up The Radio and Superstar. Superstar shines like Ray Of Light. Ooh la la, Madonna hasn't been this cheerful since Music. Two of the best on MDNA.<br /><br />2) Gang Bang is so vengeful that even Madge is dead sure she's going straight to hell where she'll join her friends. Make a dedication to your foes!<br /><br />3) Falling Free is a quaint Medieval piece reminiscent of Loreena McKennitt. Similarly, Love Spent sounds like a McKennit number given a dance twist.<br /><br />4) I ______ Up (can't even star dot the word as Amazon will not post the review) is refreshingly honest and very uncharacteristic of her Madgesty. I mean, humility is not something one would associate with her. It goes from a ballad and then to very upbeat and then slows down again. This song would have fit in nicely with the rest of Like A Prayer.<br /><br />5) B.Day Song. I'm drawn to the sunny vibe and plain simplicity. But I can understand why others would find it childish.<br /><br />6) Best Friend. Very thought provoking. Sometimes when you grow up, you lose your best friends because of differences in outlook in life. I was reminded of Jody Watley's Friends.<br /><br />Lyrically I have to agree with the other reviewers - SOME NOT ALL of the words are pretty inane. One example is Give Me All Your Luvin'. Don't play that stupid game cause she's a different kind of girl? How is she special? Her status or character? Kind of reminds me of Give It To Me - get stupid. ???<br /><br />On the flip side, there are a couple of club bangin' fillers - I'm Addicted, Some Girls and I Don't Give A.<br /><br />The artwork is very well conceptualised, though it is a visual representation of  the fragmentation of personality - an esoteric concept.<br /><br />For me, MDNA rises above her last three - Confessions, Hard Candy and American Life. Honestly, I haven't truly enjoyed a Madonna album in a long time till MDNA. She just went out and did better. It is also the first time Madge has put out a deluxe version of her album unlike the special packaging with one extra song. MDNA offers fans some of the old Madge as well as her newer incarnations. Destined to be  another Madonna classic!
0425263908|2.0|BARE TO YOU is billed as an alternative to FIFTY SHADES OF GREY.  It is a weak imitation, with little plot, less action, and no point.  Yes, the sex is hot, but there's nothing else.  The writing is slow-moving and often frustrating, leaving the reader wondering which character said what.  The characters aren't particularly believable, and certainly not endearing.  Gideon is rich, but has no interests, no cool expensive toys, nothing but ego, money, and good looks.  Eva is damaged, mysterious, but accomplishing nothing.  In the end, she is a whiner, prone to walking out whenever there is the slightest controversy.  Gideon is chauffeured around town in a black Bentley SUV.  I don't believe Bentley makes an SUV!  But okay, the real problem with this book is that it isn't very well written.  Ho hum.  In a world of endless entertainmaent choices, this book does not justify the reader's time.  FIFTY SHADES is fast-moving and extremely entertaining.  As soon as I finished the first book I ordered the other two.  BARE TO YOU has gone nowhere, and I have no more time to waste.  I won't order a second portion.

I don't agree with some of the other people saying that you can just skip the first book and just read this one. You should definitely read the first one! It's slower paced, but it still has important information and lets you see the relationship of Lena and Alex and their world.  I can't wait for the third one!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Downloaded for my nephew and he likes it as his reward for doing his chores. Great way to keep him busy.
B004T4KQJS|5.0|Amazing and disturbing at the same time.  That is a comment one rarely hears from me.  Dr Krauss did a very good job of explaining difficult-to-understand concepts and managed to interleave some light comic relief along the way.  I was especially impressed by his argument that Nothingness is unstable and (essentially) that the existence of Something is inevitable.  This book also heightened my pre-existing appreciation for the power of Randomness.<br /><br />What I found disturbing (not that I disagreed with them) were the conclusions of both Krauss and Steven Hawking.  I won't comment on what the conclusions were ... that would be like telling \\"who done it\\" before you read a \\"Who done it?\\" novel.  The conclusions left me with a nihilist aftertaste which passed after a while.  Sort of like when your doctor tells you to take two aspirins and call him/her in the morning.<br /><br />The argument that I distill down to \\"the existence of Something is inevitable\\" may be disturbing to those with a religious/creationist/intelligent-design bent, but no more than the disturbing nature of the shift from the Earth-centered (geocentric) view of the cosmos to the Sun-centered (heliocentric) view would have been to the Sun-god worshipers.<br /><br />It was a book that I am very glad I took the time to read.  It is not a lengthy work, but it is packed with information that one might fail to gain by reading 10 times as much.  Well done, Dr Krauss!  Thank you.

B007ZBWJXI|4.0|There is nary a duff song on this album, the eleven-track import.  A few of them, however, could have used some editing with regards to some repetitive choruses and some of the lyrics come off as being a little trite in places-- hence, the slight  deduction for my part.<br /><br />There are great instrumental sections in every song-- 'poppier-seeming' productions, courtesy of Mike Paxman, in relation to the previous two 'reunion' albums-- especially the outros to Bury Me In Willow and Face On The Bridge ... reminding everyone one of the four individual talents comprising this band.  John Wetton's voice sounds as strong as ever and his bass-playing seems to be a little more prominent these days-- I like his work on Astra the most though, being the most active.  Steve Howe also seems a little more engaged in the mix this time around as well--still not as strong as on the debut album-- and all of his solos are top notch, absolutely delightful.  Carl Palmer only has a few places to really showcase his chops-- Tomorrow The World, Bury Me In Willow and Faithful-- in keeping tradition with the recent past, but his sensibilities are in tune with this 'poppier' direction of 2012.  Geoff Downes' keys are still the mainstay in every song-- driving the melodies to and fro, AND home-- and his parts dovetail very seamlessly with those of the guitar-- again, check out Bury Me In Willow!<br /><br />Highly recommended ... and second in the pantheon of Wetton-fronted albums, IMO, trailing the debut by only by a few points and slightly ahead of Astra, Alpha, Omega, and Phoenix-- in that order.  Enjoy!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Provides much better information than the standard android battery manager. Good interface as well as informational tools about usage history.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|I usually avoid gangster or biker shows, yet Sons of Anarchy (as well as The Sopranos) is one of my favorites. The quality of the drama transends the subject matter, and the characters of Jax and Clay take on the stature of Hamlet and Claudius. In the Northern California town of Charming (really), a weak police force has a tacit arrangement with the \\"motorcycle club\\" The Sons of Anarchy, also known as Samcro (Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club, Redwood Original). The cops look the other way on Samcro's gun running and occasional internecine violence. In return, Samcro keeps drugs and other gangs out of Charming.<br /><br />The plot intricasies are far more complex, however, and herein the episodes become addictive. Internally, the Sons and their associates get wound up in twists that beggar your average soup opera, and the club's external adversaries grow more numerous and deadly, including rival gangs (excuse me, clubs), neo-nazis, the ATF, and gosh-and-begorrah, the Irish Republican Army. Somehow this all makes sense in delightfully suprising and suspenseful ways.<br /><br />One of the many worthy features of SoA, is its capture of the sense of brotherhood shared by club members who wear the \\"cut\\", the sleeveless jacket flying the colors of the club. The show reveals this repeatedly, in various ways, including a gruesome episode depicting the fate of an excommunicated member who failed to black out his \\"reaper\\" tattoo.<br /><br />The cast is solid, with Ron Perlman, Katey Segal, Maggie Siff, and other familiar faces. Although this is technically a review of Season One, look for a hilarious cameo by Stephen King in Season Two.<br /><br />A caveat, though, is if you dislike representations of violence on your screen, this is not for you. Violence is swift, often, and deadly. This is somewhat softened by a sense of humor and irony which pervades the episodes, and an examination of the fatal flaws of the club, voiced most often by one of the major characters, Jax, who isthe club vice-president, and his \\"old lady\\" , Tara, who is a medical doctor.<br /><br />The romance between the biker and the doctor is a bit difficult for me to buy, but it seems to work in Charming.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you like action, scheming, and a peek into a dangerous and exciting wild west town, you can't lose with Samcro.

Firefly has something for everyone (seriously): it applies pioneer culture to space travel; it has highly developed characters (played by incredible actors) who speak in a fusion English and Chinese (don't worry English speakers, you'll understand everything).

B007L3BMGA|1.0|This book did not live up to the hype. It is poorly written - childishly so - which makes for awkward reading.  There are much better erotic fiction choices where the dialogue is more believable and the characters more likeable.

B005DC68NI|5.0|Great book, filled with valuable information for smart-asses like me who already think they know everything about the publishing industry. I'm a self-published author with six novels under my leopard-patterned belt.  Yet, this author really schooled me on facets of the publishing industry.<br /><br />From the first sentence, I was hooked like a lazy mackerel caught unaware. The tone of the book is very conversational, breaking down every area of self-publishing. By sharing his personal stories, the author comes across as an intelligent, vulnerable individual who's learned from his good and bad experiences in the publishing industry. Whether you're new to this game or an experienced author, I can safely say there is something in this book for everyone.<br /><br />So you may be asking, what's so great about this book? What makes David Gaughran such an expert in this area?<br /><br />It's obvious that in addition to his own experiences, the author has done a great deal of research on everything including the history of publishing, promoting with social media, setting price points, optimal months for selling books, writing short stories vs. full-length novels, calculating international royalties, dealing with agents-turned-publishers, websites vs. blogs, and - damn, how much more do you want? All you need to do is take a look at the table of contents to see that this is a reference tool every author should have in their literary toolbox.
B004LROUNG|5.0|John Grisham is one of my favorite authors and I was not dissapointed with this book.  It was humerous, yet suspensful with a great ending.
B002DD67XG|5.0|Between 1970 and 1977, James Taylor embodied the role of the sensitive singer/songwriter and released six studio albums for Warner Brothers, yielding such hits as \\"Fire and Rain\\" and the million-selling \\"You've Got a Friend.\\" By the time Taylor released IN THE POCKET (his last for the label in 1976), he had eight Top 40 hits. Unfortunately, two of those hits are not included on this collection. Missing are \\"Mockingbird\\" (a Top 10 duet with then-wife Carly Simon) and \\"Long Ago and Far Away\\" (a No. 31 hit from MUDSLIDE SLIM that features Joni Mitchell on backing vocals).<br /><br />Also worth noting is that two songs--\\"Something in the Way She Moves\\" and \\"Carolina in My Mind\\"--appear in re-recorded versions since the originals appeared on Taylor's self-titled debut on Apple. Also new to this collection was the live rendition of \\"Steamroller Blues.\\" (A song in which Taylor utilizes the \\"MF\\" word.)<br /><br />I've owned GREATEST HITS since its original release in 1976. (But at ninety-nine cents, I got the download version, too.) This along with Columbia's GREATEST HITS, Vol. 2, makes for a decent overview of Taylor's career. However, an artist of this magnitude really deserves the box set treatment. Until that happens, this is a great place to start.  VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B000IEXVCC|5.0|This truly a first rate David Lynch film with a lot of appeal for both hardcore fans and casual moviegoers.<br /><br />For the casual movie goer we get:<br />Beautiful (sometimes haunting) cinematography of various Los Angeles locales.<br />Beautiful actresses (they are all over the place)<br />Interesting story, with an end that actually makes sense.<br />Great musical score.<br /><br />For Lynch fans we get:<br />A layered symbolic movie with much more going on than the casual movie goer will get (at least in the first viewing).<br />A complex ending with MANY possible solutions (on the surface it seems easy, but scratch deeper and more is revealed.)<br />Very moody, dream-like in true Lynch style<br />Quirky dialogue<br />A couple frightening scenes in the way only Lynch can be so creepy<br />So much more!<br /><br />Bottom line is it's must-see.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This is a short book. You can scan through the whole thing in about 15 minutes. But it is an excellent step-by-step procedure to get all those formatting things right when using Word to write for the Kindle. I have often been frustrated in the past, when using a variety of software to convert documents to Kindle format, that my Kindle book did not turn out as I expected. This book has shown me how to overcome those problems. And the price is very right.

B005LAII08|2.0|Forcing a young woman into marriage when she is not ready does not make her happy and is generally agreed upon, outside a few uber-religious communities, as not the right thing to do.  The latest Disney heroine to take on the concept is Merida, protagonist of \\"Brave,\\" a rebellious redhead with a prowess in archery as a result of a gift bestowed upon her by a boisterous but loving father.  This is much to the dismay of her mother who wishes her to take on what many today regard as an antiquated feminine role of passivity and elegance.  The process with which she must choose her husband involves a competition among her suitors in an activity of her choice, which turns out to be--you guessed it--archery.  Needless to say, Merida, in a toast to girl power, shows up her three mediocre, socially-inept suitors with her own archery skills and proceeds to address her overall marital issue through a spell that changes the one forcing the marriage issue, her mother, into a bear.  This provides for some intense moments as Merida is forced to defend and care for her mother in light of her father who is determined to avenge a lost limb by killing the bear.<br /><br />The problems with this story are twofold:  First, fighting forced marriage is bit like fighting the Holy Roman Empire.  It is a noble fight but the enemy really doesn't exist anymore, outside a few cloistered segments of society, with whom most of the audience probably doesn't associate anyways.  Plus, Jasmine and Mulan already fought that battle, succeeded, and had presumably brought even the most obstinate detractors onboard.  Second, it is unclear exactly how showing up her suitors or turning her mother into a bear helped to win her case.  She proved that she had better aim than her suitors, but so what?  Many a successful husband has been landed without the foggiest notion on how to operate a bow-and-arrow.  Then, the bear bit showed that she could take care of her mother in spite of an army of adversaries led bynone other than her father.  But again, so what?  If the mother's motivation for a forced marriage was the security of the kingdom, would such an antic really eliminate that notion?<br /><br />The final product feels like a rush job, where several individuals of varying interests were summoned to assemble a product to meet various business objectives, with the story secondary.  The product should be the first Pixar to feature a female lead to tap into the young, soccer-playing girls who find it gratifying to show up their male counterparts.  Check.  It should have some fights so that the young male audience doesn't perceive it as a \\"girl's movie\\" and avoid it.  Check.  It should showcase Pixar's animation to be a cut above anything produced elsewhere.  Check.  It should include some magic or witchcraft so that it does not come across as an animated version of a Jane Austen novel.  Check.<br /><br />In spite of its splendid animation, the movie ultimately fails not because of its female protagonist or its magic.  It fails because of a flawed story concerning an overused adversary.

B002GU5V24|5.0|These 5.1 discs, as everything in all the sets, are of course a wonderful collection for all fans. What is stunning and sad for me is the omission of a live Carpet Crawlers sung by P.Gabriel.

One can read an ebook on their PC and one can keep bookmarks so one doesn't lose their place:) As for John's book it started out slow but he finally reveals his secrets at the end. I thought he had some useful tips for a newbie self publishing author like myself.

B0000024ZT|4.0|For almost any other artist, 5 stars. But compared with other, later masterworks, it's still a little uneven. Bruce is still searching for his 'sound.' Nevertheless, he manages to perform some timeless classics for this album. In spite of this, it's instructive to remember that this album at the time was received largely as a 'regional hit,' which is to say that it was wildly popular in the Tri-State area, but not so much elsewhere. I attribute that to the novel sound of the E street Band. Keyboard heavy, with hardly a guitar solo in sight, it was a little hard to pin down (and pigeonhole) when it first came out. The same reception would await his second effort, The Wild, the Innocent...' It would not be until Born to Run, that Bruce would break out of his regional audience. By that time, it was evident that Springsteen was exceptionally talented. How talented would not be fully realized until his next album, Darkness of the Edge of Town; and we all know the rest of the story. However, even on Greetings, you can hear the fully fleshed out Springsteen sound on certain tracks like Spirit in the Night and Growing Up. Still, there are some unsuccessful experiments here also. Not necessarily bad, exactly, but not in playing up to Springsteen's particular genius as a vocalist and song writer. Thank goodness, Bruce realized this as much as anyone, and his output steadily grew more and more impressive over succeeding albums. I don't think the poor initial sales of Greetings and The Wild were warranted. These are great albums by any measure; rather it was a problem of synchronicity: the world just was not ready for Bruce Springsteen in 1973. It came around, eventually!

0307383415|4.0|In 'Dreams from My Father,' Barack Obama provided an insightful testimony into how he came into being. He described his background, including him being biracial and the unique experiences throughout his upbringing, in which his Kenyan father was almost entirely absent, and Barack Obama living in Indonesia. Since he knew little about his fathers background, he provided the context for how his mother was raised. That involved discussing his White grandparents, and how they raised their daughter in a manner that would lead to her falling in love with and marrying a Black man.<br /><br />Barack Obama discussed his high school and college years, in which he tried to define his racial identity, and developed a revolutionary mindset. He associated with Blacks more than others, as he attempted to find a place for himself in a racially polarized  society.<br /><br />During Barack Obama's career as a community organizer, he performed duties that provided little monetary gain, and involved a lot of determination and tenacity. The work involved forging alliances among people and organizations in order to make society better. Although success would lead to satisfaction, it was difficult work, but something that provided good training for the political world.<br /><br />After working as a community organizer, Barack Obama attended Harvard Law School. He then began spending time with his sister from his father's side, and met other siblings. That led to a trip to visit more relatives in Kenya, in which he learned a lot about his father, and the things that led to his father living the life that he lived. During the trip he learned a lot of his family's history, along with the history of Kenya, and its affect on their lives.<br /><br />Reading 'Dreams from My Father' was very enlightening because it showed how Barack Obama came from humble origins to become President of the United States of America. The book revealed not only his life experiences, but also the context of larger issues that affected him and his family. I find it interesting to learn about people who have risen to prominent positions. Reading the book is something that anyone who wants to learn more about Barack Obama should do.
B004LWZW7Y|4.0|I grew up only liking a few cartoon characters and was never a Disney animation fan. But since the advent of 3-D computer animation I've been hooked on good graphics, interesting characters, and humorous plots. I liked the way Puss in Boots tied several children's fairy tales into the storyline. The accents of Antonio Banderas and Selma Hayek really added to the experience.

Who knew wheat was such a problem??  I am now advising family, friends and coworkers to read the book and stop eating wheat.

It's OK to harbor a blood-thirsty vampire that has killed 11 totally innocent blue collar workers and then 10 friendly and gentle young adults because the depraved vampire will make my family prosperous and prestigious again.

A ghost can destroy an all-powerful witch but a shotgun, a vampire and a werewolf are totally useless!

Despite how much I love sitting among a live audience, I will refrain from going to the movies until the The Hobbit is released at the end of the year.

B007JRU2UK|4.0|The story was better than I expected.  I liked looking at George Clooney, but I didn't think his acting was believable.  I liked the story a great deal.  Beautiful scenery for someone who has never been to Hawaii but would like to go.
B000ZELISO|1.0|I found Half-Blood to be very depressing and even worse, so predictable! There is no greater sin in writing a story than being boring! Half-Blood also made no sense. No, I did not read the books, nor would I ever waste my time. The only strength in the world of Harry Potter is the bond amongst friends. This strong sense of friendship and loyalty is the only redeeming element in Harry Potter series!<br /><br />I guess that's the reason why I, and many other people, keep going to the theater. Of the six films I watched so far only the previous one, film #5, \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,\\" felt enjoyable and made plenty of sense. In Half-Blood, I'm amazed that you can kill off a major character and have even Harry Potter, himself, going around saying: \\"It was a waste, it had no meaning. He died for nothing.\\" How ironic when a story's main character literally sums up the ENTIRE story!<br /><br />I had high hopes for Half-Blood! I don't like seeing Harry Potter and all the other \\"Good Guys\\" being so powerless/clueless, or a main character turning into pure evil for absolutely no reason, whatsoever! (I should be able to know what's going on by not having to read the books. I have watched every film in order, but it still made no sense!)<br /><br />What is obvious to me is that the Harry Potter series has become a commodity like toothpaste and underarm deodorant! Lets stretch a very thin storyline into as many billions of dollars as possible, and see all the star-struck idiots spend their hard earned money! Sorry to say, Harry Potter could have easily been condensed into a trilogy and if Half-Blood was never written/filmed it would not have harmed the Harry Potter storyline ONE iota!<br /><br />Sorry, but I refuse to watch the last two (wasn't the grand finale divided into two parts? What a surprise!) Harry Potter films. I have spent enough money on Harry Potter movie tickets and I have no intention, whatsoever, to waste another penny on making the writers and filmmakers of Harry Potter, richer!<br /><br />SEE:[[ASIN:3639085213 Film as Commodity: A Critical Discourse Analysis of Newspaper Film Reviews]] and [[ASIN:097999893X For One Week Only: The world of exploitation films]]filmmakers of Harry Potter, richer!<br /><br />SEE:[[ASIN:3639085213 Film as Commodity: A Critical Discourse Analysis of Newspaper Film Reviews]] and [[ASIN:097999893X For One Week Only: The world of exploitation films]]

0345803485|5.0|This book was awesome, it has a lot of intensity to it, but it also goes beyond that, beyond the sexuality. The story line is one that takes you to dark places, fantasies and realization. It makes you realize that there are people in this world that have wants and needs that they cant even explain themselves (or the why behind those needs). The end makes you wish that you would have bought the entire trilogy.

I am an African American gay man who has experienced the same parental issues as the daughters in this picture.

B000BTJDGC|4.0|I enjoy this movie very much.  The movie was very good and the preformances top notch.  What I enjoy watching the movie over and over again when I am in the mood because there is a spiritual message behind it or meaning behind it.  As a Catholic I have what I believe in and I believe the movie did a good job showing what Emily Rose went through and the impact it can have on a person's life.  Also I like the ending where they show what happened after the trial and that people go to see the grave of Emily Rose as a holy shine.  Just my personal feelings I believe the Devil tempts the strongest of believers to test us and our convictions.  But as for the movie if you want something to watch as both a powerful drama mix with horror scenes then see this movie and see how it impacts you after seeing it. I am sure you will enjoy the movie as much as I have over the past few years.

The app is well worth the space it takes on the Android tablet and gives me a similar capability I have with Bible Gateway on my desktop.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|This cd is amazing and Adele does have an amazing voice with powerful lyrics song after song.  I just didn't enjoy track three Turning Tables, and track six He won't go.  Rest of the cd is just great song after great song with her beautiful voice.  So if your into mixture of songs with pop, blues, so forth then pick up her music cd and enjoy the cd track after track.
B008COD5OO|5.0|I watched this movie on the way to Seattle for a 1 week Alaskan Cruise. The movie was very entertaining, but it was hard to sleep at night because we left our dorky 16 year son at home for the week too. Luckily the worst thing we came home to was a freezer full of frost because he didn't close the door all the way. This movie reminded me of Superbad. It was a little silly, but entertaining from start to finish.
B008ASLK8A|3.0|Did not like this one as much as the first. Can't put my finger on any one thing. Just didn't do it for me.
B008B37C8Q|5.0|I was reading the bad reviews of this album and getting pissed off but then I realized there are over 100 positive reviews and only 8 under three stars. To me this album is Zappa's masterpiece. I had borrowed this album from a friend in the late 70's, when it was out of print and hard to find, and dubbed it to cassette. A few years later I bought what I came to find out was the same copy of the album in a local used record store. I skipped buying the CD when I heard the newly overdubbed bass and drums. Can you imagine the uproar if they added new bass and drums to Sgt. Pepper? This was corrected on the next issue of the CD so I bought it and listen to it quite often. 35 years after I first discovered this album it hasn't lost a bit of it's charm. Funny and sometimes serious but mostly genius.

1451608659|5.0|I loved this book, so much that I was unable to put it down once I began reading it. I adore Dominique more now, after reading her struggles and hardship...which despite all that, she was still able to maintain her focus and drive in the sport. A must read!
B000005S0D|4.0|I wore my vinyl version to death years ago and recently picked up 'Stationary Traveller' on CD. I must admit that I'd put off doing that for years, simply because the tunes on this album are of a darker nature, focusing as they do on the then harrowing situation faced by those living in Communist governed (and policed!) East Berlin. There was also the fact that longtime Camel drummer Andy Ward, whose wonderfully light, musical feel was so compelling was gone, and the drumming here was more, well, typical of the genre. At this point Camel was down to founding guitarist/vocalist/flutist Andrew Latimer with a fast of very fine supporting players (including David Paton - Pilot, Alan Parsons, Elton, Kate Bush etc.). After all these years - and with the dismantling of the Berlin Wall - I found it easier to focus on the music and not the darkness of the topic. And what a delight! As always, Latimer's guitarring is wonderfully melodic and creative, yet tastefully understated unless he's soaring over the groove with one of his (truly) great solos. With titles like 'Vopos', 'Cloak & Dagger Man' and 'West Berlin' there is no avoiding the subject matter, which is made all the greyer by Latimer's somewhat monotone voice. But still the overall effect is highly compelling. The only thing that prevents me from giving this album a 5-star rating is the fact that it is missing that joyous ambiance I love so much with most other Camel albums. And that - subject matter aside - has much to do with the absence of former band members Ward, bassist/vocalist Richard Sinclair and keysman Peter Bardens (though the keys playing on this CD is excellent). I guess one could say that Camel had such a band personality that the loss of any one of those key players takes a bit of adjusting to. But this is still a fine CD, so don't consider that previous comment as a negative. Indeed, it was just another step in Camel's long history of change. If you'd like to see the aforementioned line-up with Mel Collins (King Crimson, Roxy Music) on sax, try the Camel Footage DVDs (for the Sight & Sound programme footage). Indeed, having all the Camel albums would be a good thing to consider. Start at the beginning and work your way along...
B0071LLHGC|5.0|My brother from Woodstock with the lone negative reveiw of<br /> this issue should consider buying and listening it. I don't<br /> know the source of the recording used by Leftfield of this<br /> outstanding ABB show,but the sound is great! and a big upgrade<br /> from any bootleg of this show that I've heard in the last 30<br /> years. It's not gratis, but it's cheap, for now. Best get it<br /> while you can...
B000006TSC|5.0|Camel are an eclectic band, to say the very least. The Prog Lite tag somehow seems the most appropriate of the lot, though possibly suggesting something diluted and watered down, which is definitely not the case here. Camel are definitely a most British band, and that - along with stellar musicianship, great (and very different) songwriting plus a musical spirit that exudes passion and at times ha-ha humour as in 'Down on the Farm' - is what has always made them such compelling listening. I'm a Jeff Beck fan who enjoys the likes of David Gilmour, early Mick Taylor and Peter Green etc., and I would put Camel guitarist Andrew Latimer in their ranks - easily! Indeed, he's more original than the latter two were in their heyday, and he can be as compellingly melodic and emotional as Beck, with a tone that is stunning. The guitar solo in 'Summer Lightning' qualifies as one of the great 'rock' highlights of all time (for me), as it eases its way over a hi-tempo dance beat with layers of vocal harmonies giving Latimer a tapestry over which to soar. Simply stunning! And there are numerous other fine moments throughout the album. Richard Sinclair's fretless basswork and highly unique vocal style (and tone) are extremely enjoyable and a nice contrast/complement to Latimer's voice. Pete Bardens (who played with Van Morrison in classic rockers Them) was always there with rich keyboard textures, while his solos and dual-riffing with Latimer were really quite unique. But one of the real aces with this band was drummer Andy Ward, whose ability to navigate odd times and various feels with such ease - and so unobtrusively - really made him an integral component of the music; no boring boom-chuck drumming here, kids, this is highly musical stuff that suggests fusion influences, though they're keep well in check. Also, FYI, Roger Waters wanted Latimer to be in his band, but apparently the pitch of his voice apparently didn't fit with the existing vocalists. 'Breathless' is - like so much Camel music - timeless. There are so many saving graces that I can't imagine ever not loving this album. True, if you're a Skynrd or Sabbath fan it may not be your music (though the couple Latimer solos here would sweep most other guitarists under the carpet and the power chorded intro to 'Down on the Farm' is a moment's worth of heaviness). I suggest you YouTube 'Summer Lightning'. Let it play all the way through. Then decide. I've loved this album since the 70s...it's a definite keeper. Also - if you can find it - 'Live On the Road 1982' (not '81 - there's one of those, too) is a storming set with David Paton (Pilot, Alan Parsons, Elton, Kate Bush etc.) in the band. And go search out 'Sasquatch' from the album 'Single Factor'. That instrumental is a ripping good example of Latimer at his best, and he's powered along by Simon Phillips (Jeff Beck, the Who, Toto etc.) kicking it up on the drums. Yes, there is much great Camel music to be had.

0525952616|5.0|Daniel Suarez has delivered another fantastic, anxiety-inducing Thriller with \\"Kill Decision.\\" I'm a huge fan of Suarez's first two books, \\"Daemon\\" and Freedom-TM,\\" but \\"Kill Decision\\" may be his best yet. Well-researched and chillingly plausible, the plot races across the world to follow a complex and fascinating cast of players as they try to uncover the answers behind a series of rogue drone attacks that are leaving behind a growing path of death and destruction. Mind-blowing forays into visual intelligence technology and insect hive behavior, just to name a couple, are woven seamlessly into the rollicking, non-stop action. Characters, dialogue, and plotting are all well handled as usual, and while the concepts and technologies can be complex, Suarez's clean, concise prose keeps it all moving and (reasonably)understandable. Overall, an excellent, chilling read. I hope the author's next thriller is out very SOON! Can't wait.
0307278255|5.0|Although all the stories in this collection are beautiful and relatable; it is the second part of the book that leaves you enthralled by Lahiri's exact depiction of emotions.<br /><br />The last story brings together the first 2 stories of the second part; and it's only after finishing the last line do you completely realize the comprehensiveness of the title of the book and the image on the cover.<br /><br />As the Oprah Magazine quoted \\"Ferociously good..emotionally precise\\".
B007XH6BPG|4.0|I think we've all been looking for more from Chris Squire, in a number of ways, but he has found what I think is the best current vehicle for his prodigious talents. Yes has been too limiting as well as too permissive a context for him. Steve Hackett brings out the primal prog best in Chris, and in turn, Chris pulls out what \\"pop\\" or mainstream song arrangements that Steve can muster to inspire. What results is some of the best mainstream prog of recent months. There is an authenticity and simplicity to the lyrics and the fusion of Yes-like harmonies and Genesis-like melodic progressions and lyric patterns. If you ever wondered 'what if' Yes and Genesis played together; here it is. The truth is, Steve Hackett helps to reign in some of Chris' more extravagant pop tendencies and keep him more honest than I've heard him since Going for the One. Steve should move Squackett even further into the realm of Beyond the Shrouded Horizon, his excellent recent solo work, as Chris's resonant bass would elevate that often dreamy space and magnetize it further. Squire and Hackett's voices come together nicely and the band's sound has more traction than recent Yes, Asia, and Icon releases combined. Nicely done. Looking forward to more Squackett on my prog toast please.
B007HO392S|5.0|I love it! \\"Good Girl\\" was a great first single! A darker storyline lies in \\"Blown Away\\" and \\"Two Black Cadillacs\\". Besides those songs, I also love \\"See You Again\\"! Great job Carrie!

B008CPZNL6|5.0|I used to have this app on my iPad and it is the app I missed most when I upgraded my iPad to a Kindle fire.  I was so happy to finally see it available in the Kindle Store.  It's not quite as nice as it was on my iPad - but that is mostly due to the size of the screen.  I highly recommend this as your app for reading RSS feeds, Twitter/Facebook posts, etc.  I'm in it almost every day.
B007KQ9OD6|5.0|Don't bother looking for an SSI EEB chassis. Almost all are built for Intel boards where the system will spend its life basking in a dreary, poorly lit computer room while being pummeled by gale force winds from whiny rack style fans.<br /><br />Instead look for water cooled solution from Corsair (the common review), or even better use the Coolermaster 812 with vapor chamber tech to keep your lga2011 xeon 8 core processor cool. If you use air cooling look for a chassis that exhausts to the top or top rear and mount your cpu sinks so the air flows from bottom to top. This will allow better cooling to the second processor. Overall under extreme maximum load I get 63C.<br /><br />Don'y use intel lga2011 heat sinks they are crap. Was getting 86C before using all intel stuff.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|Thank you LinkedIn for finally giving us an app that works on our Kindles.  This seems to work fairly well, but not as well as the LinkedIn app for my Windows Phone.  For example, it threw an error when I went to read one of the articles that I found on it.  With that said, it is still a solid application and suitable for doing most of your LinkedIn work from.  Hopefully LinkedIn will continue to improve this one.  I also like that it integrates with other apps that allow me to post social links - for example, I can now see an article on the Flipboard app and, from there, post a link to the article on LinkedIn.  Very nice detail that LinkedIn made sure was in the app!
B0074MZSWW|5.0|I just posted this comment in reply to a negative review and then see that lots of others are bothered by the \\"poor recording\\". I just have to say that I feel sure this is by design. Funny that this sound is disturbing to so many people....I felt like a child when I heard it the first time (I am a 56 year old female).....especially the \\"buzzing\\"....an immediate and completely involuntary smile hit my face! Like \\"comfort-food\\" for my ears. It reminded me of the sound of some of my favorite albums (long b/f CDs) from the 1960s and 70s. Loved it! Loved it! It is intentional, I am sure...and it is showing up on lots of recordings these days. For example, I hear it in the Black Keys music lots of times. Listen to the keyboard on BK......same \\"old\\" (not \\"ole\\") organ-like sound at times. Sounds like it was recorded in a garage. Would love to know for sure, but I think it must be by design. I think you'd have to \\"try\\" to get that sound with<br />current equipment.

B0072OFOM6|5.0|Yes , the price of season 2 is high , but it will be cheaper when it arrives the first week on the shelves. perhaps $25 , just check out Amazon (LOL). As for season 2 review , it got off on a slow start. first getting used to a new main star  . and second missing Andy Whitfield in the part. With the other shows that Starz had on tv such as CAMALOT an MAGIC CITY  , both flopped . Starz lost a big gamble trying to keep up with the big boy HBO an lost . It shows by what movies they keep repeating without any new ones . Too bad that SPARTACUS , had to suffer for this bad programing problem, cuz an actor worked His life away trying to make us happy an wanted to keep it going after He died. BLOOD AND SANDS  was awesome , John Hannah was clever backstabber along with the ruthless Lucy Lawless as His wife who ran their arena of death. The bravdo of Spartacus as He rose to the top an how We cheered as he said \\" kill them all ' !Then the bad news of the cancer, the deley an then they made GODS OF THE ARENA , a prequel that was quite a good back story . then the news that Whitfield died, an picked a new SPARTACUS, but things didnt work out good since STARZ was losing money ..fast , and decided to cut the story down an yeah , kill off many characters toward the end of season 2 . Well to bring in new characters for the final season. Thete wasnt much they could do with them any way, the producers most likely said. Well season 3 should be a 'hell of a great story \\" . The trailer shows a massive battle with hundreds of soldiers an Rebels. I would had loved to saw another season , but that isnt going to happen . Im will be in line or be ordering my copy of \\" VENGENCE\\" on amazon,and when season 4 comes out the same , i hope you will do the same. see ya at the checkout line !

I would tell myself that I would only read one more chapter, but then I couldn't stop myself from reading more.  Do not be discouraged by the fact that the setting is the UK.  I quickly learned the cultural differences, the changes in vocabulary, etc.  This book is highly suspenseful, realistic, and filled with details that are often painful to read.  This was an exceptional debut novel about a woman's struggle to escape her past and move forward.

0345803507|4.0|So, I'm pissed at Christian Grey now. Having read the first two books I knew his limitations, but I thought in the second book he was really making some  progress. Now in book three he turns into a pouty adolescent again. SPOILERS AHEAD:<br /><br />His reaction to the pregnancy had me in tears. Not happy tears, angry tears. Yes, he regretted it later. He regrets everything later, but the problem is he doesn't man up at the time he should. I felt so horrible for poor Ana, just sitting there being abused because she dared to get pregnant. What was he thinking?? In this book Christian becomes even less likeable to me that he was in the first book. I know at the end it's all hearts and roses, but I'm not sure if I was Ana I would be able to get over it so fast (or ever trust him again). Not to mention all the times in this book he loses his temper spectacularly, and punishes her for having a mind of her own.<br /><br />As for the book itself, it has more plot that the first two and moves along at a good pace. Definitely readable and worth the time. Hoping she does a full length novel from Christian's perspective, although I still don't like him.

1451683405|1.0|Free will is a problematic concept -- difficult to spell out, and in conflict with our assumption of causation of everything in the world.  Causation itself is not well defined either, but we at least have a better understanding of the term.  I have always been interested in how to reconcile Free Will with the physical world, and I was excited that a clear thinking modern philosopher had something new to dsay on the subject.  But  Sam Harris, in Free Will, has produced an extremely disappointing piece of sophomoric reasoning.<br />His thesis, summarized, is that:<br />* human action can be either caused or random, and neither allows for free will<br />* therefore our perception of our free will is delusional<br />* supporting evidence for this is that neuroscientists see evidence of our actions seconds before we decide we will act<br />* therefore we reach decisions independently of our \\"will\\".<br />Every bit of this argument is problematic, and a thinker of Harris's depth should have punctured it, not EXPOUNDED it.<br />Taking his points from the top, the first bullet of his thesis is a false dichotomy.  That he repeats this fallacy over a dozen times in this short work just lead me to shake my head over his blindness.  Human THINKING is geared toward categorizing things as either deterministic or random, but our predilection for these two categories does not make them exclusive options for the world.  In actuality, macro level objects are rarely modelable as deterministic - influence applied over a background randomness is how almost everything we deal with behaves.  And subatomic particles likewise break this paradigm, behaving like a probability distribution within a waveform.  While neither of these models are really any more compatible with free will than the two of his false dichotomy, their obvious refutation of his fallacy indicate that self reflection did not trouble Harris's mind in the contemplation of his own reasoning here.<br />For the second bullet, our perception of our own free will has developed over an extended evolutionary process, and the default position of evolutionary reasoning is that evolutionarily refined beliefs and behaviors provide real benefits.  FALSE perceptions of the world very very rarely provide benefits, and supporting such a claim requires strong and convincing evidence for how false beliefs in this case would of necessity be evolutionarily beneficial.  He provides no such argument beyond his false dichotomy.  Basically, we have a conflict between two mental frameworks that humans have evolved - our tendency to assign everything to the caused/random pidgeonholes, vs. the belief in free will.  While it is possible that BOTH are delusions, we know that caused/random pidgeonholes are NOT reflected in the real world, so if one must reject just one, then one should reject the refuted false dichotomy, and declare the belief in such pidgeonholes to be the delusion.  This makes Harris deluded, not those whose beliefs he seeks to challenge.<br />For the third point, yes, Harris cites valid test data which demonstrates it takes seconds to organize our nervous system to perform actions.  But Harris makes a major error in the next step of his reasoning.  He assumes consciousness and the mind is unitary, and that evidence we prepared for one action means that we were not simultaneously preparing for multiple actions we did NOT take.  That he asserts this, while also citing the researchers and mind theorists who have refuted his assumption, is bizarre.  He repeatedly quotes Daniel Dennett, and even cites personal conversations with Dennett, yet Dennett's Multiple Drafts model fully explains how one could make conscious decisions between options seconds after the brain started organizing around several of them.  He also cites Libet's work, and Libet conducted tests showing  that people prepared mentally for an action they then chose NOT to execute!  That Harris could be unaware that multiple mind thinkers have refuted the unity of consciousness, Libet's work, or the central feature of Dennett's thinking is almost inconceivable, for a major philosopher writing on the mind.<br />The fourth point of his thesis, that we decided beforehand, and in fact everything is decided beforehand, he repeats dozens of times in the work.  If one assumes determinism, as he does, then free will is impossible.  Asserting a conclusion that is embedded in one's starting assumptions is classic circular reasoning.  To repeat this fallacy dozens of times in one short work is a travesty.<br />So, four points, two of which are fallacies, one of which neglects evolutionary principles, and the third of which neglects the last half century of mind research.  This short work was worse than disappointing.ers have refuted the unity of consciousness, Libet's work, or the central feature of Dennett's thinking is almost inconceivable, for a major philosopher writing on the mind.<br />The fourth point of his thesis, that we decided beforehand, and in fact everything is decided beforehand, he repeats dozens of times in the work.

B000HKYO46|4.0|First off this was a great episode, the beginning act had a real cowboy space feel (like something from the Star Wars cantina, or Firefly). The following couple of points are just things that don't add up for me (warning it's me being critical):<br /><br />Some logic problems with the Xindi \\"destroying Earth\\" arc.<br /><br />1) It's not that hard to destroy a planet....by the year 1960 we already had enough nuclear weapons to destroy our own...C'mon in the 26th century (Xindi from the future) they should have a single little missile that can annihilate a solar system.<br /><br />2) Even if you destroy Earth, Humans have terra-formed and spread out on cargo and space-ships throughout the galaxy....these are some of the brightest most ambitious Humans too. You know they will want revenge and will be capable of delivering it. The Xindi are just setting themselves up for destruction again.<br /><br />3) As I said previously why did they do a \\"test death ray thing\\", just to give the Humans time enough to come after them? And why didn't they test it out on San Fran (AKA Star Fleet HQ)? Ugh...plot devices..<br /><br />Sometimes I wish I was dumb and unperceptive so I wouldn't so easily notice these things. The show is still very entertaining and I love a good story arc and a \\"bad guy\\", so of course I'm still gonna watch (and it's free to me).

B000HL2JO2|5.0|and *cue commercials* $.$<br /><br />Quite a gag there at the beginning, but unexpectedly this turns out to be one of the most clever episodes to date. I don't care how implausible or unscientific this one gets...for some reason it just hit a home run for me. Maybe it's because Trip is one of my favorite characters on this show, or maybe it's because the acting was just so damn good. Either way this will go down as one of my favorite Star Trek episodes of all time. You'll just have to watch it yourself.<br /><br />p.s. LeVar Burton strikes again, every episode he touches turns to gold. The man can do now wrong.

B000MZHW40|5.0|When I was first assigned this movie for my summer homework, I was expecting a bland, informatory film of sorts. However, when I learned that Leonardo DiCaprio was in it, I figured it couldn't be boring if he was in it!<br />  The movie is first of all, based on themes such as a \\"culture of fear\\", showing the audience a war-torn country and the cruel treatment of its residents. It's a movie everyone should watch at one point, it's really eye-opening and gives you a different thought on the lives we have, and how lucky we are to have it.<br />And I have to say something about DiCaprio's acting of course! Love him!!

B001XIPDBO|5.0|The book reflects the life of author Ishmael Beah, who lived in Sierra Leone with his family, until he is torn apart from them in war. As I read this, I became immensely thankful for the peaceful, rich life I have, and found myself cheering Beah on as he struggled to survive, and finally, forgive.

B007B8H97Q|5.0|Really, it's all in the title.  Although I'm not usually one for period dramas, the phenomenal cast makes this show a must-see.  Maggie Smith as the Dowager-Countess is of course just spot-on, but so are so many of the other actors and actresses from top to bottom.  The sets and exteriors are gorgeous, the directing is excellent... The seasons are short but well-planned, which makes this a great show if you don't want to spend hour after hour catching up.  Honestly, I can't think of a single thing to criticize. I can't wait for the 3rd Season!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The book was good, it wrapped up the Trilogy nicely! The Fifty Shades trilogy was a little hard to get through, but the Fifty Shades Freed kept me reading all the way to the end.
0425263908|4.0|Loved this book! Actually think is very much like Fifty Shades but this is better. FS actually irritated me with repeated prases I find annoying, it was a great series anyway. Really looking forward to the next installment of this series.
B004QL7K6Q|5.0|Easily one of the funniest paul rudd movies ive seen. This had me laughing from start to finish which is hard to do nowadays for me anyways. Jennifer aniston is great in this movie and this is by far paul rudds best performance. You might find his mirror scene annoying the first time but it only gets funnier every time you rewatch this movie. Also the unrated edition is on the special features and is 18 minutes shorter....its more of a blooper version i think...its not as funny but its funny to watch if that makes any sense....dont watch the unrated version before the standard.
B005G02RIC|5.0|Tosca is one of my favorite operas.  This production is an open air production but all the performers are first class.  The set management for an open air performance is very imaginitive and works quite will.  Thumbs up!
B007XF0X16|5.0|I actually liked clash of the titans. When i first saw it in theatres i hated it...the 3d gave me a headache and just couldnt get into it but i decided to buy it anyway upon release and ended up enjoying clash of the titans. So when i heard they were making a sequel and that it was getting better reviews then clash did i knew it was going to be good...or terrible. So i waited until the blu ray came out and ordered it. When i watched it i was blown away. The acting, action, everything is just turned up to 11 in this one. The action is almost nonstop throughout the movie. I just wish liam neeson was given more parts.
B007ZXK08C|2.0|This book started so well and then became one of the silliest and most implausible books I've read in many years. I only finished it in the hope the author would redeem herself and steer the story as well as she had in the first half. Sadly not.
B007EJ6S92|4.0|The first and main album is called alpha noir and the songs represent the more agrresive side of moonspell. In my opinion there are some really good songs in it but overall it lucks the atmospheres of night eternal . However their gothic side is not lost because on the bonus cd which is called \\"omega white\\" we hear moonspell at their best . the atmosphere on each song is the highlight of this album and it's one of the best albums of the year so far for me.also on omega white the vocals of Fernando Ribeiro are outstanding and full of passion!!!Overall moonspell deliver a must-have release for their fans and fans of this genre. if they had removed one or two songs from each cd and made them one album it would have certainly have got a 5/5!

B005IGZW0Y|5.0|This book, though listed as the World of Downton abbey, revolves around context setting. It gives the reader very little insight further into the actual comings and goings of Downton but does flesh out and explain the behaviours of the characters as well as helping the reader comprehend the era. It allows one to step into a different time and spend a moment facing the challenges of a Lady Mary or a Mrs Hughes. A warning though, don't read it prior to watching the full series 2 and, I would think the Christmas Special, it does presume you are fully  up to speed on the latest happenings at Downton.
B005IQZB14|4.0|I just finished Wild by Cheryl Strayed and must say I am now inspired to hike. She describes what the experience did for her in clear, experiential terms. I was surprised with how candid she was describing her life before her hike, and during her hike; I appreciated that and I felt it brought me closer to her character, understanding why she did the things she did.<br />It is a well written memoir that deserves kudos.
B005LAII08|3.0|This movie, like so many movies that I've seen this summer, was just mediocre. My girls thought it was pretty good (they're seven), but I felt like the magic of the previous Pixar movies was lost this time around (I guess it was the same with Cars 2 though). I hate it when the antagonist of the movie becomes more of an idea than an actual person or creature. Although the animation is absolutely beautiful, I just felt like they could have done SO much more with this story.

B00005JPFH|1.0|I just wrote a review of the new Spider-Man movie (The Amazing Spider-Man), and felt compelled to write a review of this one as well. Afterall, this movie left such a sour taste in my mouth that I was SO happy that they rebooted the series. Now, I know that some peoople will complain about me giving this movie one star, but it is literally one of the worst movies ever made! If it is any indication, this movie is worse than Ang Lee's Hulk movie (and that movie was a giant steamy pile!)! I don't understand how Marvel can have such a good series going and then cock it up on this one. Not only that, but Venom is the coolest Spider-Man villain of all and they made him look like a giant pansy here! Anyway, give The Amazing Spider-Man movie a try. Don't get me wrong, it's definitely not Dark Knight status, but it is MUCH better than this!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game! I usually don't play games but found this one and cant quit! I am addicted! highly recommend this to others!
B005LAIHPY|3.0|This movie had some pretty cool special effects & action scenes, but I don't expect it to win any Academy Awards any time soon. I feel bad for Taylor Kitch (sp?). I think he's a pretty good actor with a lot of potential, but his movies this summer haven't done well at all! This movie is worth a rental, but I wouldn't go adding it to your blu-ray collection without renting it first.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is amazing!!!! What makes it better though...is that it is FREE! Carnivorous Monkeys chasing you while you collect coins, what is more fun that that?
B005LAII1C|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of \\"Family Guy\\" and I do enjoy Seth McFarlane's humor. I guess I just found this movie a bit stale after an hour and a half. This movie does have some pretty funny moments, but it just didn't achieve the \\"classic\\" status that I expected it to.

0316776963|4.0|Me Talk Pretty vaguely takes the form of a non-chronological autobiography so I'll call it a memoir. This book is meant for fun and laughs, and if there is a deeper level it is in getting to know David Sedaris as a person. This isn't quite so easy because of the ways Sedaris recounts some stages of his life. The grim ones in particular, like his time as a tweaker, takes the idea of show not tell a little too far. Sedaris never mentions his feelings about important and grave events, but of light ones. He escaped all his perils and aimless stages in life to finally be a successful author - but he writes as if somewhere deep down, he always saw this future coming - he was always in on the joke, and was living a crazy life for a while in order to have plenty of stories to tell. This kept Sedaris at a distance from me. Certainly its his choice to do so, but this is the first memoir I've read that wants it to be this way.

But, I heard Cheryl on Oprah's series and the enormity of her journey and the life lessons she had learned on her hike came thru loud and clear.  Her book did not disappoint.  It is well-written, a story that deserved to be told and it well worth the read.<br /><br />Forgiveness, grief, recovery, faith, courage, accountability--they are all there.  Thanks for being willing to share, Cheryl.

0739344269|5.0|I am in awe of this book. Truthfully, I am not really into these types of reads but this makes me want to think twice!  It's hard to believe that Stephen Hawking has a sense of humor! Yes, throughout all of the M-Theory lead ups, he keeps the readers interest by making the stories interesting & not talking about himself & his theories the entire time!  Last time I read a theory book that was the case (turned me off from the genre since this book). Since I am not familiar with this particular genre, I found myself reading aloud at parts to get a better understanding of the concepts (like the early Ionian's he names).  But it's definitely worth the purchase.  I closed this book with my mouth open.  Stephen Hawking is one of the greatest minds of our time.

1847442250|4.0|The Time Keeper, by Mitch Albom, follows the creator of time. Dor, the main character, is Father Time; he is the Time Keeper, cursed to hear every one of man's cries for time. Published by Hyperion, ISBN: 9781401322786, the book should appeal to anyone who have ever said \\"I just don't have the time.\\"<br /><br />As a young man, Dor is the first human to develop a system of counting and measuring time. His discovery leads him to forsake everyone in his life, except one person who is immune to his obsession. This one person, Alli, is the only one who holds the key to access Dor's attention; the only one whose presence has the ability to make Dor forget about his discovery. Dor's motivations are made clear by the author. His environment and his discovery play against each other in a well-developed tension which, in turn, plays into the development of the entire narrative.<br /><br />Mitch Albom provides enough detail at crucial points in the story to inform the reader of the driving themes of two other supporting characters, Sarah and Victor, who are plagued with being bound by time. Their personal struggles and their lives are driven by their blind constraint. Along with Dor, they are all prisoners of the same device. Only when the protagonist frees Dor, does Dor begin to understand the sentence and the meaning of the very thing he invented. He is a slave, perhaps in Plato's Cave, where he is only exposed to the shadows of thoughts and reality from outside the cave.<br /><br />He eventually becomes the master of the thing that once held him. He holds the hourglass, where he was once imprisoned and which now maintains control. Before he can guide the others through their obsessions, he is without direction as he discerns the meaning of his hourglass. The suffering and death of his wife was beyond his control in his former life. Would he now have the opportunity to relieve the suffering of others before they ran out of time?<br /><br />As the story comes to a climax, Dor must discover a way to intervene in the lives of Sarah and Victor. He must provide both of them the keys to escaping their own bonds, but first, Dor as the master of time, must now discover the significance of time. Having the power to effect a thing, we learn, is not the same as having real understanding of the thing. We are often blinded by the very thing we are compelled to worship.<br /><br />I found the story well-written, with an abbreviated writing style making me feel like I was reading the thoughts of the characters instead of waiting for an author to develop the players for me. I was pleasantly shocked on reading how the sands of time represent \\"every moment of the universe.\\" Overall, Mitch Albom presents a book where the focus is not on the style, but on the underlying development of the grand theme of time.<br /><br />I was so engaged by the presentation of the story that I would have guessed it was merely about 50 pages instead of the actual 240. But as I learned, \\"Time Flies.\\"must discover a way to intervene in the lives of Sarah and Victor. He must provide both of them the keys to escaping their own bonds, but first, Dor as the master of time, must now discover the significance of time.

1451648537|5.0|I could not imagine reading around six hundred pages about Steve Jobs, especially because I thought his being portrayed as a legendary figure is overblown. So I actually didn't buy the book until I picked the book off my friend's new apartment shelf just out of curiosity and reluctantly started reading the book. I was intrigued by author's comprehensiveness. Walter Issacson's biography on Steve Jobs is comprehensive yet inspiring. it is full of quotes, people names, locations, interviews, numbers, pictures and other details of Jobs life, framed by the author's interesting narrative and sensible judgements. I think he has really tried to be factual and objective which is essential when it comes to telling the story of a controversial figure as Steve Jobs. I was also surprised by the author's ability to describe technical details.<br /><br /> I have listed the things form the book that I found new and interesting about Steve Jobs:<br /><br />1. Steve Jobs was smart, controlling, passionate, minimalist, abusive, impatient, persuasive, perfectionist, cruel, creative, rebellious, uncompromising, and charismatic. He could be simultaneously described as a Jerk or a legendary by different people.<br /><br />2. Although he co-founded Apple, he was not a very good engineer as opposed to his co-founder, Steve Wozniak, who was a brilliant engineer but didn't have the incredible marketing and leadership qualities of Steve Jobs.<br /><br />3. Steve Jobs could tell that the idea you are proposing is \\"shit\\" as he frequently did. Yet, he could enthusiastically sell the same idea to yourself next week. Various people who worked with Jobs had observed this behaviour.<br /><br />4. \\"Reality Distortion Field\\" is the phrase that people had coined in order to refer to how Steve Jobs ignored reality  to push his own ideas and inspire his employees or even avoid unwanted things in his life. \\"Reality Distortion Field\\", however, was a double-edged sword for Jobs. While served him being visionary throughout his career, it proved troubling for him and people around him. His denial of the fact that he had become father of a baby girl at twenty three is a good example of the dark side of his \\"Reality Distortion Field\\".<br /><br />5. Jobs was not a religious person per se. However, he was deeply influenced by Zen Buddhism. He was also a strict vegetarian.<br /><br />6. I was surprised to read that Steve Job sometimes burst into crying in various situations including business affairs.<br /><br />7. One of the core ideas of Steve Jobs was his belief in total solutions in which software and hardware were integrated, and the user experience is totally controlled. This was completely reflected in Apple products. There was an alternative philosophy that Microsoft had which was licensing Windows to various hardwares and providing more choice for the user. Steve Jobs believed  in producing perfect products and taking full responsibility for the user experience even if it resulted in losing the market.<br />8. Jobs was a kid of sixties and seventies who liked to seem like a hippie and a rebel. He said having LSD was one of the greatest experiences of his life. He also had experienced marijuana.<br /><br />9. Jobs co-founded Apple, the most valuable company on earth, with around five hundred billion dollars of market capital. He was forced out of Apple. He went on to create Pixar which produced \\"Toy Story\\", \\"Mosters Inc\\", \\"Finding Nemo\\", and other great animations. He then came to Apple when it was on decline, and led it as CEO to produce amazing products and ideas such as iPod, iTunes, Apple Stores, iPhone, iPad, and iCoud.<br /><br />10. Job's Stanford Commencement Speech is probably the most commencement speeches ever.  Here is my favourite :<br />\\"Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything - all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment orfailure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.\\"

B003Y5H59C|5.0|The movie was very good.  I was intrigued by the plot as it isn't for everyone, but a good story about self-discovery.  Lee and Mr. Grey find each other and feed off of each other, they seem to make themselves \\"whole\\" as the story progresses.  My favorite line in this movie is when Mr. Grey tells Lee, \\"We can't do this 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\\" and Lee replies \\"Why not?\\"  This has quickly became one of my favorite movies.

B008CJ0JTI|5.0|This movie is one great ride through the soul of a man. That throws him down a rabbit hole and forces him to overcome odds that drive him to his braking point. Led by everyone in the story to places and events unknow, Nicholas travels through the absys of disperation, and dicovers that through one last act. He will break free from everything that held him back from his life, family and the past.<br /><br />I have been waiting for a high qaulity version of this film. With \\"The Criterion Collection\\" its have finally arrived.
B005LAII3U|5.0|I wasn't looking forward to this film since I'm a big fan of the original.  I was actually the only one in the theatre.  Sitting there brought back memories of the 80's when I watched The Thing and Blade Runner alone.  Those films became classics and while I can't say this film will I still enjoyed it.  Wiseman is a visual director and I've been a fan of his from the beginning.  Total Recall is a stunning looking film and very action packed.  It would be wrong to call this a remake but a new interpretation.  It does pay homage to the original which was nice to see.  There's also some humour to be found although it's rare.  Kate does a great job as usual because as you know \\"she gives good wife\\".  It's too bad this film won't make a lot of money but then some great films don't.  Take a chance you just may like it.

1612183956|5.0|Ethan Burke wakes up battered, injured, confused but with very vague memoriesof a car accident.  As his day progresses he stembles into a very typical American hometown but the people give him a strange vibe.  As the days pass and things get stranger and stranger his memories return in bits.  He remembers he is a Secret Service Agent and came to this town looking for 2 missing federal agents.  Sometimes people say strange things to him but the sheriff is just about downright hostile.  I dare not say more at this point because of spoilers but this is the most awsome mystery I have read in a hellofa long time.  I never did figure this one out till the end and I had lots of help.  This is an all nighter that you will not put down.
B007SSDS24|4.0|A novel twist on the alien invasion trope.  Spoiler alert: It doesn't break out of the boilerplate arithmetic of survival/horror movies, wherein new characters can only exist for a short period before the character list gets trimmed down again to a comfortable number.  This leads to scenes of avoidable death after improbable survival.  However, I felt it created a true sense of post-apocalypse and the absolute devastation that would be wrought if spacefaring aliens decided to invade.  The plot was suspenseful and characters were likable and more fully realized than a collection of tropes.  It didn't really impinge on my enjoyment of the film that (a) aliens would be able to find lots of metal-rich spacerocks without travelling to an inhabited planet (unless they need oxygen for their machines or something) and (b) Given the aliens are engaged in planetary core mining (and spacetravel, of course), it doesn't seem likely that a few hundred survivors in each city would be able to dampen the aliens' operations on earth, even after we find out ways to survive.  But one can come up with plausible in-universe scenarios for this.  A really excellent genre movie.
B005LAII08|5.0|I went into this movie not knowing at all what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised with a visual extravaganza of brilliant color and painstakingly detailed beauty. This movie makes the natural environment come alive on screen. The animation is second to none. The story itself is wonderful, about a daughters quest for independence and the struggle in a mother/daughter relationship that is timeless. My daughter is 10 and absolutely loved the film. As a Dad, I loved seeing her breath in and be captured by the story. The heroine is young and strong and sends a good message for women today. There is plenty of humor to amuse both the young and old. I also do not think it is any more frightening than the Disney classics of old like Snow White or Cinderella that had their share of villainous scenes.<br /><br />I can't wait for this film to come out on Blue-Ray so I can enjoy it again in my own home.

1439153663|4.0|The reader will get a peek of how things could and may very well have been in the past. The story starts in 1791 and ends in the 1800's it spans the life and adventures of an Irish orphan-servant girl and a mulatto slave girl. Their lives inter-twine in the deep south on a plantation. The story has many surprises for the reader. Living in \\" their shoes\\", so to speak gives depth and realism while reading and 'living' their stories.<br />Lavinia, the Irish girl has her say and Belle, the slave girl gives you hers.<br />Possibly the events that happened to them could have happened to others in \\"real life\\", but who knows. Did they make the right choices? If they didn't, their stories would have been very different.<br />There is good and evil events in this book. I will not give away any \\"spoilers\\".

B004EPZ03O|5.0|Make no mistake about it... I am a MUPPET FANATIC.<br /><br />I've been a Muppet fan since the day I first saw them as a child. I can remember sitting around watching The Muppet Show and just having such a good time. It's one of the fondest memories I have of my childhood.<br /><br />The Muppets have been out of the limelight FAR too long.<br /><br />We the fans HAVE MISSED THEM.<br /><br />But now they are back. AND BACK WITH PURPOSE!<br /><br />Thank you to all who made this movie happen... it felt like a Muppet movie and it was AWESOME. I cried at the end cause I felt that it finally did the Muppets the justice they so rightly deserve.<br /><br />See this movie. I won't ruin anything for you. Just see it. If you are a Muppet fan, you have to see this... you have to own it.<br /><br />All these years later... THE MUPPETS STILL HAVE IT!!!!
0789208547|2.0|I love Norman Rockwell paintings, and I jump at the chance to see his works when possible. So when I found this book at my local book store, I was thrilled to have such a massive collection of Rockwell's paintings in one collection on my bookshelf. Sadly, in my stupor over my find, I failed to fully inspect the prints as closely as I should have, otherwise I would have noticed how washed and faded the colors are on all of the prints (the exception being the cover sleeve, which was more vibrant than the print found in the books pages). It's sad that so much of the color is just absent from the paintings, but I suppose that's what happens when a publisher cares more about money than about quality. Save your pennies folks and just go see the real things in a museum when they come through your neck of the woods.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|If you haven't seen Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor, and Captain America... WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN!?!?!?!?!?!<br /><br />Seriously... those movies are a MUST for you to understand the entire story of The Avengers.<br /><br />Now anyone who knows me knows I am a huge Marvel junkie... was from way back in the day when I collected comics. I am VERY PICKY about the way the Marvel superhero movies are done.<br /><br />I was extremely please with all the Iron Man movies, Thor, and even the 2nd Hulk movie... not a huge lover of the first Hulk movie or Captain America but at least Captain America was tolerable compared to that first Hulk movie (Eric Bana is bad Hulk!)<br /><br />I love Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark aka Iron Man. Every movie he plays this role in seems to me he's getting better at being Tony Stark. I love Chris Hemsworth as Thor. I can tolerate Scarlett Johansson as the Black Widow and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury. I like Chris Evans... that's why I saw Captain America even though I am not a huge Captain America fan. I am extremely delighted in Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye cause he really looks the part and his acting is always spot on. Tom Hiddleston as Loki... flawless as always (I just wanna hug Loki for some reason).<br /><br />Where my major concern was ... was of course, where most fans concern was, THE HULK aka BRUCE BANNER. Mark Ruffalo plays this part... and he NAILS it. I mean, he reminded me of Bill Bixby in the original TV version of The Hulk. I was SO pleased that the Hulk finally got someone RIGHT to play his part. And then ... HULK SMASH... and The Hulk says some stuff... I was SO pleased that someone finally got The Hulk right on screen.<br /><br />Even if that someone was someone I am essentially mad at... by the name of JOSS WHEDON. Ah, Joss Whedon, he who killed BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER for me by season 4 of the series with all the story line BS of \\"the key\\" and Buffy going all psycho... yes... THAT Joss Whedon. So, he is behind one of the BEST Superhero movies I have ever seen. Gah. And I have to ADMIT THAT? Ok, Joss, you win this round. Still mad about some things from Buffy... but when it comes to Superhero movies... you did the Avengers some TRUE justice... so thank you.<br /><br />This movie is everything that a MARVEL/AVENGERS fan would want. And with the ending... a promise perhaps of a sequel?!?!? *crosses fingers*<br /><br />I saw The Avengers in 3D (it's my first EVER 3D movie since I was 3 and saw King Kong). I recommend seeing it this way because it was totally awesome from start to finish... a little hard to keep up with SOME of the action in some parts but it was WELL worth it for the effect of it all.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is the Superhero movie of the year... if not DECADE. We superhero fans have been waiting for this... and it's everything promised and then some (great awesome HULK funny moments too). I won't ruin the movie AT ALL for you... SEE IT... SEE IT NOW!!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its pretty fun and a good way to pass time but sometimes gets irritating cuz of the lag..but overall I recommend it
B005LAIH54|4.0|After Clash of the Titans, I expected a lot from a sequel... especially being the Greek Mythology Nut I am.<br /><br />Wrath delivers everything I hoped for and then some.<br /><br />Sam Worthington returns as Perseus... he's dead on when it comes to this role. He's so believable as a demi-god who doesn't want the power but doesn't want to not help his father Zeus who again is played by the GREAT Liam Neeson. Again returning is Ralph Fiennes as (my personal favorite) Hades, ruler of the Underworld. Liam and Ralph are SO believable as God brothers and they have this huge chemistry when acting together.<br /><br />Now new additions to the cast such as Rosamund Pike as Andromeda (whom I totally loved by the way), Toby Kebbell as Agenor (who made me laugh several times but didn't turn the story too much toward comedy), and Ãdgar RamÃ­rez as Ares made Wrath of the Titans a really well rounded cast. I was pleased to see Bill Nighy as Hephaestus... he's one of my favorite actors and to see him is ALWAYS a pleasure but he was a VERY good Hephaestus with his babbling and \\"One last godly thing...\\".<br /><br />Anyway... on to the creatures...<br /><br />The Chimera wasn't half bad. I would have rather it not look so damn rough but hey... whatever. It wasn't the beast I was looking forward to. The 3 Cyclopes were VERY well done and believable. I enjoyed seeing them done in a way that didn't rob the story ... and it actually lived up to what I think (and probably most people think) a Cyclops should look. The Minotaur... while done in a believable way was not in the movie enough. The whole Minotaur fight was brief and really could have been explored more. And finally... Kronos the father of Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades. I was extremely pleased that they made Kronos so well. He kept his Titan stature but wasn't too overly huge making it a very well done effect.<br /><br />Between the Effects, Acting, and the story in general... Wrath of the Titans is very enjoyable. The ending gotto me... but of course, as a fan of Greek Mythology... it was supposed to get to me.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Another amazing game! Love this game and where's my my<br />water. I look forward to all the updates and future levels. Get it you will love it as well!
B007MDB71O|4.0|I really thought this movie would be bad... but it was quite the opposite. It had great effects, awesome acting, and a good story. Even the ending was good enough for me... I know, I know... SHOCKING. You will get a little lost at the beginning cause it's a little heavy to start out... just have some patients. Once John Carter gets to MARS... the fun starts and it will be a ride you enjoy!!!!
0062213423|1.0|I orderd this on june 30 it is aug 5 and i have still not recieved it!

B007SYWFRM|5.0|love this game ive only been playing for 20 minutes and its addicting. if your a facebook person and you like farmville then you will like this game. you get to create your own village just with animals and habitats instead.
0345803485|5.0|People are crazy, Fifty Shades of Grey is amazing and is an orgasm in a book. I have no idea how you could rate E. L. James and Fifty Shades of Grey poorly. Have you never had an orgasm just thinking about your lover touching you, or your lover looking at you? Biting your lip is a turn on to many. I pity all of you who rated this poorly, you all should have better sex lives. I couldn't stop reading, I give you ten stars, please continue the books. Ignore the poor reviews!
B005AUWY90|5.0|I bought this for my kids for Christmas and waited to watch it for the first time until they opened it and we watched it together as a family. I had overheard from friends and read some reviews with people saying how this was so much less than what they had hoped for. My kids (ages 2 1/2 and 3 1/2) loved this movie a lot. I am not shamed to say that I enjoyed it too and watch it sometimes when they aren't. The graphics are great, there are so many different models of cars, different accents, and shows kids different countries and what they are like. I still enjoy the original Cars and it is a classic, but the 2nd can never replace the 1st. I wasn't disappointed at all and still watch this on a regular basis.
B0037VNX44|5.0|I've never seen another movie like this, it's great! It was a lot funnier than I expected going into it. Very recommended.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey! Hot hot hot! Yes it is erotic but it also has a definite storyline which keeps you on the edge of your seat. Will Ana or won't Ana stay with the gorgeous,but emotionally damaged Christian Grey? It is a must read for all ages. I am 62 and thoroughly enjoyed the suspense and grandeur.
B008MEM24S|5.0|They didn't. copy off where's my water. They just made it better where's. my Perry was created by the same people who made Where's. my water
B007ELN8Y8|5.0|The Artist is pure art.  I was blown away, totally.  I believe color and spoken dialog would have detracted from the effect.  The overall skill required to achieve the<br />effect demonstrated by superb acting, directing, cinematography, etc. is consistent throughout and would be difficult to repeat, I am sure.  It is a masterpiece.<br />It is not of this age and will not be the beginning of a new \\"genre\\" of movies but rather a unique work that will be admired as other masterpieces of other art forms that may on occasion be copied but most likely not matched.  To watch this movie will not be a waste of your time, but rather good for your soul.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|this version stinks.  I tried it at a friends house.  just get free version exact same.  who cares about ads. 99 cents to remove ads? not for me. I got free version
B007VTVGFQ|5.0|I was so afraid to open this and listen to it after the last two \\"new releases\\" from some of my favorite artists had come out and been completely...... bland. I hate to be one of those that says \\"It's just not the same anymore about any artist, because being a writer, myself, I  know that you get to a point where you want to experiment more. The very first song, and I sighed the deepest breath of relief.  I think that this album is pure poetry. Some of the music is hard to hear, in ways, but obviously that is an expression of where she is and her pain.... But the symbology, prose, strange journey this album brought me through over and over again has become as least as amazing to me as Extraordinary Machine, and when I heard that album, I was completely unable to listen to anything but for weeks, heh. There is only one song on this album that is \\"so-so\\" to me, but it's probably because its more humor than depth. Not saying it's not a good song, but I don't sit my friends down to say \\"just listen to how she says this\\". If you can stand the intensity, and have a love for words and prose, but are a little on the strange side and enjoy commiserating with other people who can voice theirs eloquently, I think there is a very good chance that you will find and appreciate the genius tucked into this album. Every time I listen, I hear something I may have missed or didn't quite catch if I'm listening undisturbed. If you can look past the stereotype of the first albums and you're new to Fiona, and any of what I've described sounds interesting, then this is probably the best cd to start with. In my opinion (and just because of my tastes)she really took the writing and journey to a profoundly new level. The most ingenious part is that she was able to keep the \\"Fiona\\" style in tact. Many times I've seen writers lose that balance. I still felt that same Sullen Girl, but there is a complexity that was just taken to the next level without losing her \\"core\\" in the process.<br /><br />This is not for someone who just likes to bop around to tunes, I don't think. :) It's for someone introspective who can either relate or appreciate really beautifully written, VERY raw content. The music was the second to grow on me, which is rare. But it all came together for me after listening to it over and over until when I stopped my ipod, the songs didn't stop for days. It's an atmospheric journey I've yet to experience in music, generally. In fact, I can't think of a single album I could compare it to. It stands out, still has some really amazing melodies, raw pain, sadness, anger (rage, maybe closer to, heh) and a sly sense of humor at times. And all put into a package that fits together somehow.<br /><br />To me, that is brilliant. I think if she could stay stable, this would be  prelude to some truly, truly unforgettable albums. It does seem, however, that it's a gamble as to whether or not every album may be her last.<br /><br />My advice, listen with an open mind. Learn a little about her history, and really pay attention to the lyrics if your enjoy word weaving. I can almost guarantee there will be a few moments when you go \\"wow, that was brilliantly said\\".<br /><br />I can't offer any one song as a favorite, but I love the line in one of the songs (I'm so bad with titles) where she says,<br />\\"We are like a wishing well and a bolt of electricity<br />We can still support each other, all we gotta do's avoid each other<br />'Nothin' wrong when a song ends in a minor key.\\"<br /><br />True. And better that than the explosive madness of a really bad breakup. :) And I love her tendency to speak over simply, or even crudely (Anyone remember Extraordinary Machine -song's called \\"get him back\\"?<br />\\"One man he disappoint me. He give me the gouge and he take my glee\\". hehe.)<br /><br />There's so much more than that I could quote. There's a really brilliant song where she eludes to a volcano (another relationship)  and then goes on to sing \\"....shot up hot from under the sea. One thing leads to another, and you made an island of me\\". Within the context of the song, it was so brilliantly put... I can't do it justice in such fragments, but, if listen with an open mind, and love really delving into lyrics as more than just ties to music as the main thread, you'll probably experience something really wonderful getting to know this album.<br /><br /> I hope I made some semblacne of sense. I probably scared a few buyers away, but I just may have enticed some newer breed of fans who aren't afraid to dig deep and let the album grow on you. For me, it was a one shot deal, but for some I think it will need a couple close listens, and open minds who aren't afraid to dive into a few bizarre bits of imagery (in the brain) or ideas and will recognize how amazing this album is, standing SO very much in it's own galaxy, but still staying SO true and cohesive on it's own.<br /><br />I hope someone experiences what I did. It's not often for me that albums bring me to these places. That's when you know it's magic..... or wizardry is the better word, me thinks. Because this was no mere trick of the hat but a deeply developed, yet raw and exposed \\"project\\" (for lack of a better word...) that makes sense as a unit in a beautiful and strange little world of its own. I never write reviews, but I couldn't help myself. I think that a new breed of minds will appreciate this more than the general populace. If you are hesitant because of the name \\"Fiona Apple\\", I'd let that rest and give it a good listening. It'd be a shame for someone who would relate to it, and she DOES let you into some really raw places, to miss it because of a more mainstream start. You're awesome (and going to enjoy your new cd) if you lasted to the end of this review. :)<br /><br />Be conscious of it, but also let your unconscious take you away a bit, and you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />FAQ: 1. No, I don't do drugs, not even the smokie (but, I'm not saying \\"I didn't inhale!\\" when I was younger). I'm just strange (I prefer, eclectic, but some people around me prefer to tend towards using.... more drastic terms. I just ask them to try to grow a less limited vocabulary, but that hasn't done me much good (or ill, for that matter). ;) I imagine this particular album would be quite an experience if I did listen in an even more heightened state. heh. :) Do share if you try it out that way. It will be some very powerful imagery, I'll bet.<br /><br />Cheers to anyone who had the same experience, or got there in a different way. And more cheers if you give this album a try based on my fragmented \\"review\\" and grow to love it.  Then I haven't wasted a moment of time writing this, for sure.<br /><br />~Wes
B008F5YDRI|1.0|I think this film is silly.  The writer (it was apparently based on a book) has no insights to convey about love, Arabs, Yemeni society, fishing, life in a British government, or anything I'm aware of.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the project was green-lighted all the way through!
B005K17RU0|5.0|this weather app works great. the radar is also very good. I would recommend. I use it on the kindle fire and have not had any problems.
B00170KA0C|1.0|This is the kind of movie you rarely see: about a horrible teacher.  You see a lot of movies about dedicated, eccentric teachers, but hardly ever about horrid teachers.  Well, here you go.<br /><br />Here are the specifics:<br /><br />The protagonist is invited to lecture in art history at an exclusive college, but instead of doing the job that the college, the students, the faculty, and the parents want, expect, and are paying her for, she instead cleverly uses her position as a front for her real interest:  denigrating the values of her students and colleagues and implying their lives are not complete or authentic unless they conform to her intellectual and social agenda.<br /><br />Essentially, it's a film about indoctrination and subversion, an investigation into the phenomenon of the seemingly wholesome and enthusiastic teacher who is in reality doing everything possible to corrode the values of the community into which she has been welcomed, even though said community makes it clear that it neither requested nor desires this.<br /><br />The director is a genius, though.  Rather than laying bare this vile usurper as the invidious influence she really is, he instead portrays the lead in a flattering light, using soft lenses, swelling violin music, etc., to make the hilariously ironic suggestion that our villain is really a self-sacrificing heroine, thus violently upending the expectations of the complacent audience.<br /><br />Brilliant.
B001CDLATE|5.0|I am not one of the ones easily impressed by big screen TVs and HD effects.  I don't consider Hollywood movies worth the cost of a giant HDTV and blue ray player. This movie and this blu ray, however, is worth every penny. It's the only movie that makes me want to run out and get a fantastic television to match the quality of this film.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Good grafix. Good game play.Lots of in game features to keep it interesting. Great for the casual gamer. Recommended for kids above 13, due to some bloody parts. Highly recommended.
145470246X|5.0|This is such a great book! I have been thinking about ordering it, when I got a chance to look inside it & decided to buy it, & boy oh boy am I glad I did!! I love it! Good job Sabine!!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|It is badly written and a cliche story. I really do not get why this is on a top list. I almost suspect that it got there through sponsoring.
B008BM9L72|5.0|I found the 50 shades trilogy intriguing as I had originally envisioned it as 'female porn' thanks to general public opinion- found it hard to put down from the first book until the end!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I enjoy this game. It keeps me awake at work, when I am ready to doze off. I have hours of entertainment.  MT4G
B0001WTVUW|5.0|THE MOVIE, THUS FAR IS THE BEST 'DESCRIPTION' SO FAR, OF WHAT A NIGHTMARISH NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST WOULD HAVE BEEN; THE WAY IT'S SHOWN HERE, LOOKS LIKE THE VERY END OF EVERYTHING AS WE KNOW CIVILIZATION TO BE...A SITUATION WE COULD HAVE ENCOUNTERED BACK IN 1962 WHEN ULTIMATELY, REASON PREVAILED. I'M GLAD THE 'COLD WAR' IS OVER. I WISH WE COULD GET RID - FOR ONCE AND FOR ALL - OF ALL NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN ALL ARSENALS...
B001O2QW9G|5.0|We like to hide various Schleich & Safari animals in our yard for our granddaughter to find. Our tortoise has survived a number of attacks by raccoons. after the last attempt on its life we decided for the sanity of the attacker as well as the toys survival it was time for it to be indoors, minus part of its foot and with a number of tooth and claw gouges as badges of honor. It is still played with and hides around indoors now. There is no question inside or outside our house about how real these replica's look. I love how detailed the face and eyes are done. They are very accurate in details, dimensions & coloration.<br /><br />With all of these toys I recommend using a ruler and a paper to get an idea of the size. They are replica's but not actual size. They are greatly scaled down. The moose we have is larger than the zebra but it does not seem large enough in comparison to the type of zebra so I don't know if the same scale is used.
B007U1FEJE|2.0|OMG, Brian, you never learn..... You're always hanging out with the wrong crowd......first the talentless Wondermints, and now the talentless, non-Wilson Beach Boys. To see you beside Mike Love sends shivers down my spine !! You should instead team up with Sean O'Hagan and become the leader of the High Llamas. I can't even imagine the superb, magical music you and Sean would write together.....
034580404X|5.0|Loved the trilogy. This set is now with the third reader and we've all loved it. Well written and easy reading. Don't start reading if you don't have some rime to invest as you can't put the book down
B000MLNUBI|5.0|You have to remember to keep winding it but after awhile you get used to seeing the spring coil and know when it is time.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|its ok but its not very exciting you do the same thing on all the levels it gets boring after a while...
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Great cross-platform notetaking app. It's easily adaptable to GTD &quot;ubiquitous capture.&quot; I use it in every facet of my personal. and professional lives.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|just got this and it is very addicting.  I really like the trial run where you see how many puzzels you can solve in a certain amount of time.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|well j think this is a great app beacuze it tells you when your kindle is fully charged beacuze on your kindle int dos not show what percent your kindle in charged on
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a good game. It is a lot like Simcity which is a game I really like. It is easy to use and understand.
0486281523|5.0|The fact that it is published by Dover tells you it is a classic, even before you look at it.  Dover has some fantastic books out.  This one is fantastic, lots of puzzles, it will keep you entertained for hours.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|One of the best books that I have read. The story holds your interest at all times.  Very meaningful in life.
B007Z9RAX4|4.0|I really liked this movie and am baffled by all the 1-star reviews.  It actually has a plot, was cast well and well written.  The feel is kind a mix of The Transporter (the first one) and The Bourne movies.  The fight scenes would make Jason Statham proud and Gina Carano's acting was surprisingly good for her first time out.  Hope they make a sequel.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I loved this book! It was a great little story that moved along equal to the speed of Harold's journey. There was his discovery, Maureen's (his wife)discovery, as well as the reader's....that is if you used Google Maps along with reading the book. I read this on my iPad so that the book and Google Maps were next to each other and I could follow Harold's journey, down to the road and sometimes his stops. I was able to literally (using the \\"street view\\" option) see the abbeys, pubs, B&Bs (in some cases) and his description of roads along the way. Being an American, it was a $12.00 trip to England! Loved the book, but even more so the map app.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a fun game (or games) and has a lot of variety so I have yet to find it boring
B008MEM24S|4.0|Good graphics. Played for days did have it freeze on me once. Sadly there were only four sections with loads of mini levels. Personally I feel that the price was good and it has keep my interest. Though sadly I have beaten the levels very quickly,but will be curious to see how the newer levels will look after an update.
B008M87GJK|5.0|Based on previous reviews, I downloaded this BBC News app, and I really like it so far.  I like being able to customize the news catagories to my interests.  The news items are easy to read.  I've always enjoyed watching or listening to BBC News, so now I can keep up to date with worldly happenings right on my Kindle Fire.  Nice!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|As you may have read from the above this film is based on a book by Edgar Rice Burroughs which was written in 1912.  The main plot centers around a confederate officer who after finding a mysterious medallion is transported to mars to begin an epic adventure.<br /><br />I originally saw this film on a rental dvd, as a fan of sci-fi movies of which there are not many in production at the moment, I decided to give this a try despite the poor reviews which I had read and the panning it received at the box office which maybe in some part due to disneys poor marketing, because in fact I had never heard of the film.<br /><br />And let me tell you what a roller coaster ride of action and laughter.<br /><br />I can liken this film to indiana jones in space, mainly because the film never takes itself too seriously.<br /><br />The main characters are believable, in fact the heroine is utterly believable.  For one I am used to the hollywood image of woman stumbling and falling over, not here though the female lead provided by lynn collins is fantastic, a truly believable heroine.<br /><br />Just to put into perspective how much I have enjoyed this film:<br /><br />I have since joined a group on facebook campaigning for a sequel and I have also bought all of the books.<br />I also watched the film a second time on the second day and enjoyed it just as much.<br /><br />I currently have an order in for the 3d version which has been publicised as being second to none.<br /><br />Take a chance on this film, enjoy it, tell your friends and join the campaign on facebook you will not regret it.
034580404X|5.0|I couldn't put this book down, it was that good and kept my interest to see what would  happen next.can't wait to start the next book in the series of 3
B008MEM24S|4.0|this is similar to where's my water.  I prefer that one but when I am waiting for the next update this will fit the bill nicely.<br /><br />this is a bit simpler than wmw.  good for the youngest generation of gamers on many levels.  no violence silly humor challenging but not so tough to frustrate them.<br /><br />overall a solid game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|there's just a few at first but you easily earn enough coins to buy all the others... lots of fun games in it
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Through the perspectives of his contemporaries, the genius, goodness and leadership of Lincoln shines through. A compelling and at times riveting read.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|very fun challenging. will recommend this app to other people. this app will be great for road trips that I have coming up.
B007Z5WMCW|1.0|STEPS PAST CHOICES MENU & GIVES A BLANK SCREEN!! NOTHING!! BIGGEST WASTE I'VE EVER SEEN!I DON'T KNOW WHY I BOTHERED TO DOWNLOAD IT AND TRY IT!
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|Okay, I'll get right to it. It's a great product but the makers are greedy sneak thieves. You pay fifteen bucks, which is ridiculous for an app, and then they have the nerve to charge another five bucks for standard fonts. And being a writer I needed the product for my new Kindle Fire. The bottom line is, how bad do you really need it? I personally won't buy another product from this company on principle alone.
B005KELQEU|1.0|While this item was advertized as a Kindle \\"sleeve\\", my standard Kindle would not fit into it.  It was therefore useless and I returned it for credit.
B007NESBK2|5.0|The best concert video I have ever seen!!! Sade is at the graduate level in fusing audio visual technology and her music.  The rest of the groups should take note.  I am still mad that I didn't see her live while she was in my backyard!!
B003TSEEDY|1.0|I saw a trailer for the movie coming out and decided to read the book. After the first few pages, I wondered if the whole book was going to consist of letters in a diary format to some unknown person. Well, that's exactly what it was. I agree with other reviewers that the main character in the book doesn't even write well, so it's somewhat frustrating to read. He writes as though he's much younger than his supposed age of 16. The content was actually offensive to me as well. There were too many references to physical and sexual abuse, masturbation, sex (heterosexual and homosexual), drug abuse (of all kinds), neglect, and there is a lot of foul language as well. Of course that stuff happens in real life, but there were very few parts in this book (if any) that made me happy to be alive. It was more depressing and discouraging than anything. I mean, it starts with a teenage suicide, and it hardly gets better after that. I like to read books for three reasons: to laugh, to learn something, or to be uplifted. This book didn't give me any of those. I returned it for a refund.
086571701X|5.0|Great book very well written.  Easy to under stand and follow the different types of system and i would recommend this this book to all that might want to understand and do this system of garding.  very good read.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|I wanted to be able to watch this and yell \\"gotcha\\" on the producers. I am a pretty conservative businessperson, and tend to view the anti-establishment \\"business is bad\\" crowd with some measure of skepticism.  Unfortunately, after watching this documentary, and the brilliant use of both facts and parallels to the tabacco industry of the 1960's and 1970's, I have to say that I am absolutely disgusted and disappointed.  Not in the Cargills and Monsantos.  I am just cynical enough to expect that behavior. Business tends to be ethically neutral at best.  I am most disappoined and disgusted at our lawmakers and government agencies that are tasked to counterbalance this ethically agnostic behavior with a genuine protective and benevolent interest for the public they were hired or elected to protect and serve. If government is truly abdicating its role as the protector of the citizens of this country, and allows monopolies like the Monsanto soybean seed monopoly to perpetuate, we are better off not paing the taxes to support this continuing behavior.<br /><br />After watching, I am both saddened by the state of the food we eat and the condition of the institutions responsible for our safety.  This is a must watch, eye opening account that will educate you on the seedy underbelly (no puns intended) of the food production industry today.  A sad state.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|just like angry birds space this update wants to uninstill your current version which means losing all your stars. I don't know if this is a kindle fire problem or a rovio problem but it needs fixed! I know that this was not necessary on the space version on the ipad. I love angry birds but this problem needs fixed now!!!!

B004JN1D2I|5.0|First I borrowed from the library, but 6 weeks was not enough for me to finish it.  I love it so much I bought the whole set.  So far I'm just into only a little more than half of the first book.  My favorite character is the Imp.  He always has the best one-liners.  I wonder who will eventually rule the kingdom.  Hope it's Dani.  And maybe Bran will kill Joffre.  Just for the hell of it.
1416955070|3.0|I can breathe a sigh of relief. I'm finally done with this book after struggling with it for over a month.<br /><br />City of Bones by Cassandra Clare has been well loved by many fans. It stars Clary, who realizes that her world is not what it seems. She meets a handsome stranger, Jace when he kills a demon in front of her eyes. She quickly gets sucked into a web of conflict and has to use all of her ingenuity to save her loved ones and friends.<br /><br />Because I'm a YA reviewer, I knew I had to read this book. I will say this upfront-- the descriptions are lovely, and the writing is sound. The plotting, however, for me, dragged and dragged. I know I'll be in the minority, because I can't even count the number of blogs that are counting down for when Clare's next book comes out. But I could barely make it through the first 60% as there is a lot of world building and back story that we are introduced to. This becomes more interesting in the last 40% especially with two really huge twists, which I wasn't a huge fan of, mostly because of a major ICK factor. If you've read the books, you know what I'm talking about.<br /><br />Overall, while had some great description and interesting world building, I can say with certainty I won't be continuing on Clary's journey, and am greatly relieved to be done with the book.
B004ZQRFGM|5.0|I bought this CD on a lark based on the accolades from other Amazon customers and it did not disappoint.  The lead track \\"Fearless\\" is really a favorite.  This lady can rock a guitar and considering English is a second language - hits the mark on lyrics as well.  Pick this up.  You will not be disappointed.
B000PAAH3K|5.0|Kindle copy of \\"Blink\\" by Malcolm Gladwell.  Have not finished it yet, but it's a fascinating look into the factors that made some of the most well-known people as successful as they are.  And it's not as much of the \\"self-made success\\" that they make it seem...
B007T9UIMA|5.0|Bought this to put back for a Christmas gift.  No problems with the package or item.  Pleased with t he product.
0375869026|5.0|As an adult, I bought this book for my 12-year-old grandson. I read it first, and then I read it again. Both times, I laughed and cried. My grandson hasn't admitted to the crying part, but he liked the book too.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for everyone! It's a fast read for adults. You may anticipate some things about the story, but there are sides of the story that are not predictable at all. Overall, the story rings true.
0062213423|4.0|I had ordered this to stick back for birthday gift.  It was it with another item that I had ordered.  The top of the book was all bent up.  Now, I've got to find ways to straighten the top out.  Other than that, I'm ok with the book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I enjoyed reading Fifty Shades of Grey. There is alot and I do mean alot of sexual content but it does have a good story and I was drawn to the characters immediately and it was a challange to try and figure out just what made them act and think the way they did. The characters are strong and the story is interesting if you can not focus so much on the erotica which can be entertaining but so distracting from just who Fifty[[ASIN:0345803485 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]] Shades is and the woman who loves him. I would not reccomend this book to a teenager or maybe not even a college age person. I dont think they would be mature enough to get the story line and it would just be about sex to them. This book is definitely not for everyone especially if you are not comfortable with erotica.

B007SGM084|5.0|This book is one of my favorites... From beginning to end you don't want to put it down... The writer make you feel like you are in. The book just visualizing the places and you are there... Seems so real... Waiting for the others..
B004MC8CA2|5.0|So far so good. Very functional, practical and User friendly. Seems to have a lot of reading plans that I hope to explore soon.
0345803485|1.0|I can see why people took so much time to write very long reviews on the lack of merits in this book and can just imagine people thinking \\" Even I can write this badly\\"  I felt like I was watching a  reality show that is so bad it is painful to watch but somehow you watch anyways because you try to figure out why it has become so popular. I am not the most sexually experienced person in the world and nothing that I read was shocking, sexy or things that I havn't experienced in one way or another ( except for the doing it with a drop dead gorgeous young billionaire bit)  I just kept on reading mostly out of disbelief and if I was going to write a review I at least wanted to read the whole book which did not take long since I found myself skipping every other sex scene. everything from the expressions, sex, plot, were so repetitive like watching the housewives getting into another fight.  I guess I feel happy for the author who after writing such a mediocre book has been able to find so much success.  I'm sure for her its like winning the lottery and I certainly don't begrudge her but she is one very lucky writer.  I am not a writer but if I was I would go into a serious depression knowing that the public wants this sort of thing.  At the end of the day we get the T.V, politicians, and books we deserve.
B0086700CM|4.0|Kids as young as 5yrs old, teenagers and adults will enjoy playing this game.  It's user-friendly and keeps kids entertained!
1905654189|1.0|Others have already put into detail in thier reviews why this book was so atrocious so I won't go into detail also. I agree 200% with all of them. I was soooo hoping to have a brutal, ass kicking ending with blood and gore and Jacob winning it all.I was very disappointed in this book. I thought the ending was lame and boring for the what the content and context of the whole story was about. I felt like alot of sub-plots were thrown in to end the book and finish any quetionable stories. I don't want to have to look up in an after thought index to remember who is who and what coven they are from and their talents. If I want to do that, I'll read a text book. It became very confusing and took away from the story for me. By the end of this book, I totally loathed the character of Bella. Mortal or immortal, she was a spoiled brat. The only character I was attracted to and liked the story about was Jacob. The ending was too sappy with everyone becoming friends. They should have used every talent they had to take out the Volturi. I did enjoy where Carlisle sort of put Aro in his place. This last book spoiled me on reading any others if she does more in this series, or seeing the movies.
B0055SWM08|5.0|great game play.  complex puzzles but simple rules.  the soft music almost lets you meditate while you move the bubbles to collect drops.  don't hit needles.  there are portals, levers, movable walls, and other imaginative scenarios, all wrapped up in a beautifully, transcendant setting.  one of my favorite games on the Kindle Fire.
B005VPRGB0|5.0|Gota love legos.  This product was purchased for my teenage kids.  They fight over who gets to build what with the legos and this was no exception.  I love the versatility of legos.  Product was delivered on time in the condition expected.  This one took longer than the usual 10 minutes to build but the kids love it.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Awesome shows very detailed in characters, Places, etc. can't wait till second season arrive here and that the thirds comes out soon

Goes to show you,  One is never to old to learn new ways.<br /> I sincerely recommended it to any one who likes knitting.<br /> Maria
030758836X|4.0|I loved the book, especially the beginning and the end, which the author adroitly made appear ineluctable. However, the middle became a bit tiresome with the back and forth between narrators and I found myself skipping pages to find out how it ended.
B004LROOUK|4.0|this book seems exhaustive - there is a lot of detail and i use it a lot to get around Japan. no guide book is perfect, but this is my favorite for Japan.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|Great entertainment.  The 3rd Tranformers is not as good as the first, but MUCH better than the 2nd.  My family enjoyed very much.  Equally action-packed.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy playing solitaire on my Kindle Fire. As far as the ads ; I just hit the &quot;back arrow &quot; and keep playing....less than a second to rid yourself of this mini aggrivation. This is a great way to relax and unwind.....at home or traveling.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|A must have for those who appreciate Bob Dylan and friends' early contributions to modern music.  The DVD is chock full of interviews and rarely seen clips from Dylan's early recording days.  This DVD reinforces what a tremendously talented musician he has always been.  It also includes cameo appearances by many of Dylan's contempories, and provides insight into the politics and media pressure of those challenging times.

B00005QW5X|5.0|I bought the DVD because I was going to see a theatre performance with 12 Hedwigs! Crazy! Loved both the movie and the live performance. Wish I had seen the original Off-Broadway version! So glad I watched the movie with original Hedwig and creative team before seeing the adventure with 12 Hedwigs! Bravo to all!

B000Q6GX5Y|4.0|I love this movie.<br />I have the normal dvd.<br />I bought this with the idea that it would be a substantial improvement in sound and video.<br />It was not substantial.<br />BUT, neither do I have a high-end TV.<br /><br />From what I hear, Blu-Ray upgrades tend to provide greater sound upgrade then visual.<br /><br />I hope this helps.
B002UD56I6|5.0|The case was in perfect condition, no problems with the cd.  It's nice to look at the product you get and see nothing that even worries you that there might be a problem.  Thanks!
B003ZVJFFM|5.0|A great disc set and price for a hard to find disc at this time of the year. Thank you.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was recommended this book, Wool (O) edition, by my father who had the pleasure meeting the author. I am a bit of a sci-fi closet geek and I just wanted to let you know this is one of the best books I have read in a long time, certainly blows the hunger games series out of the water. Rivals classics such as 1984 and Brave New World. I have already bought three of Hugh howey's other novels. Not only am I addicted to the story/plot/&characters from Wool, I am also enthralled by the attention to detail, the character development and the ability of this writer to create true suspense. I will continue to follow this series as a fan, read his other novels, and recommend him to anyone who can read. Thanks! Natalie

B007IXWL2C|5.0|the book was very good and always kept me interested I would highly recommend this book for anyone to read
0142000671|3.0|Of Mice and Men is a good novella with good characters and a creative plot. Steinbeck does an excellent job at portraying the lives of migrant farm workers, and develops an unlikely relationship wonderfully. The story itself has an interesting moral, and one of the largest hyperboles in the history of literature. However while i did say it was a good novella, I believe it would have made a better novel. The novella itself is crammed and packed with hidden meanings and themes (a literature teachers dream), yet i was left wanting more. It fell short in character development and story. While we were informed of the desperate flight from the first town, I would have liked to have had the escape described in more detail. I was just left wanting more (it doesn't help that steinbeck isnt my favorite author).
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I would highly recommend this book for anyone to read. It was very interesting and I never wanted to put it down
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was intrigued by what I had heard about this book and it lived up to my expectations and then some! I needed a good book to distract me and was totally engrossed from the beginning and also surprised that I would like what I now call an erotic love story.  My favorite part was the inner dialog with the main character Ana, with her Inner Goddess and her Subconscious always pulling in different directions. After reading this book, I realized I had a sleeping Inner Goddess and she woke up! I enjoyed the author's way of portraying a different voice for characters at the beginning and end of the novel to further define their motives and background.  I also realized we all have our shades. I was devastated at the end of book I and had to start the second book right away. I read the entire trilogy twice within about a month, and it will stay with me in many ways. linda m.
B004LSO6YI|3.0|So, this movie is pretty weird... I was looking for a good lesbian movie... Rather, a movie with lesbians in it that doesn't fall in the \\"adult film\\" genre. And this sort of falls in between O.o<br /><br />So the movie is basically about a priests' wife who falls in love with a photographer. It ends oddly. Won't spoil it.<br /><br />It's weird... Um. Just think: heavy breathing, bad writing, awkward acting, longest kiss in recorded cinema (3 minutes long, seriously), and lots of eye rolls... Yup. That's it. I wouldn't pay to watch this.<br /><br />3 stars because it's a lesbian movie and they tried.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this application!  I have it on both my phone and Kindle Fire.  Lots of translations with the ability to download some for offline use.  Our church even has sermon notes in the \\"live\\" function. Very useful!  You need to download today!!
030758836X|5.0|This is a story of how a fictional marriage which apparently started out with love and happiness slowly becomes a nightmare of attachment due to pressures of economy, family responsibilities and, most importantly, the baggage of youth that each partner brought into the relationship.  We slowly learn each partner's side of the story of downfall through the day-to-day tale of the husband's perspective and what we believe to be the wife's diary during the first half.  Then we learn that both have deceived not only each other, but the reader also.  I couldn't put it down and will most likely read it again.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Said update avail so i clicked. then the install said uninstall so i did. then it installed and all progress lost. So over this version to. have have seasons left, but its not worth it anymore.
B005FJ7DOM|4.0|I really liked this movie.  When I say the first vampire in this movie I was a afraid it was going to be bad.  But from that point on it was really good.  Good acting, nice story although not original.<br /><br />If you are like me and like apocalyptic movies that have people scrambling to survive after the world gone bad then you will like this.
B005LS5M2M|4.0|GREEN LANTERN is a spectacle to watch - much Technicolored etherized air, visits to other planets, transformations of aliens into humanoid forms and vice versa, lots of derring-do on part of the newly hewn superhero, etc such as in all of these comic book turned films that are so popular - but at its core is a rather sensitive story that for this viewer redeems it. It is a tale of how to overcome fear and to believe in dreams in order to make life in this world livable that for the audience of youngsters for whom these comic books were created presents a challenge and a possibility. It also brings some insight into the topic of filial competition and the role that parents play in fostering this unfortunate sense of worth. Is it a great film or a revelation of philosophy? No, but it does entertain on a different level than most other movies of this nature and that is in large part to the fine performances of a cast that takes the film seriously - in a good way.<br /><br />A really fine synopsis of the story is here: 'A cocky test pilot, Hal Jordan, acquires superhuman powers when he is chosen by \\"the Ring\\", the willpower-fed source of power, of the Green Lantern Intergalactic Corps. He, reluctantly at first, takes on the challenges these superheroes face. Putting his self-doubts aside, and spurred on by his sense of duty and love for his beautiful, intellectually equal, colleague, Carol Ferris, he is soon called to defend mankind from Parallax, a super-powerful being who feeds on fear. He is the universe's last chance, as many Lanterns have been killed and the Corps is weakened. And he might just be the right Lantern for the job of keeping the world safe from harm.'<br /><br />Martin Campbell directs the solid cast of seen and unseen characters: Ryan Reynolds shines as Hal Jordan, our 'Green Lantern', Taika Waititi is Hal's best friend Tom, Blake Lively is solid as Carol Ferris, Peter Sarsgaard morphs as Hector (Hal's brother), Tim Robbins is the father figure, Mark Strong is the Spock-like Lantern from another planet, Angela Bassett steps in as the secretive Doctor Waller, Temuera Morrison is the lantern space alien who passes the ring to Hal after succumbing to the evil of Clancy Brown as the ominous Paralax, there are some fine voiceovers for the creatures of the Planet AO - Geoffrey Rush as Tomar-Re, Michael Clarke Duncan as Kilowog, and Warren Burton and Salome Jens as the Guardians.<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds has such a strong positive screen presence that he is able to make us root for his flying sculpted body Green Lantern. Though the film had bad press and failed to create box office accolades, it is a strong movie for this genre. Seeing on Amazon on demand gives it a full screen treatment to try before buying the DVD. It is better than expected.
