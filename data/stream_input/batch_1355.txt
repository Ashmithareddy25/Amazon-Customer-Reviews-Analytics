B002M5E2DW|3.0|Let me start out by saying that this is an inspiring book.  If you have never been introduced to the Law of Attraction, this is an entertaining and inspiring way to learn the basics. However, that is all this author teaches, just the basics.  She has taken the Law of Attraction, compacted it, and made it more marketable to the masses. There is much more to using these Universal Laws then she discusses in this book.  If you are truly interested in learning about the Law of Attraction, there are much better choices available. They may not be as flashy or have all of the hype surrounding them that this book does, but you will get a much better understanding of these Laws.  One more thing, don't let the title fool you. The Law of Attraction is not a \\"Secret\\". The Bible and many other ancient writings mention it as well.  If you are interested in learning about this, do a search here at Amazon and see what else is available.  Once again, this is a good book, if you are new to the Law of Attraction, but it does leave out some important information.

B005TBWN0K|5.0|I am a teacher who co-teaches in a middle school math class.  Often I find myself needing to provide copies of the notes we put on the board to many of my students.  Being stuck at a computer typing notes or with a notebook writing notes that I have to go copy is very frustrating.  I finally found the app I have been looking for to use with my Fire that will allow me to walk around the classroom and record the notes that are being put on the board for students to copy that I can then upload to my school webpage for students and parents to access at home.  Finally happy!

B000003CVX|5.0|I introduced myself to Richard Strauss's work when I purchased the recordings of David Zinman and the Zurich Tonhalle Orchestra. I noticed right away that R. Strauss was a master of Late Romantic Classical Music. The composer had created some timeless melodies and complex orchestral structures. Don Juan, Tod und Verkl&auml;rung (Death and Transfiguration), and Festliches Pr&auml;ludium (Festival Prelude) are prime examples of his apparent intelligence. Eine Alpensinfonie (An Alpine Symphony) was composed in 1915, a time when he was at the peak of his career. It is one of his most programmatic works, and requires over a hundred players. It is musically complex, and yet it's quite colorful and tremendously explosive. Although the work itself a bit of a challenge because of the number of players required, it has found itself a wide discography. Numerous conductors such as Karl Bohm and Neeme Jarvi have accepted the challenge and, as a result, have been praised for their own renditions with the orchestras that they have chosen. My personal favorite is still the Zinman recording, the first one that I've ever purchased. However, it looks like Zinman has found a worthy adversary: Andr&eacute; Previn.<br /><br />With the ever-popular Vienna Philharmonic, Previn pays as much attention as Zinman. The only difference is that Previn adds more energy into the piece. He displays more emotion as he superbly captures the imagery of the Alps: from the rivers to the glaciers to even the cow & its cowbell. The Vienna Philharmonic's performance is just dazzling. The brass are heard loud and clear, the woodwinds never lose their delicate touch, and the strings play with the right amount of power and blissful lyricism. There are some faults to Previn's recording, however. The \\"Obscured Sun\\" and \\"Elegy\\" are a bit rushed, and the soft percussion is barely heard in some moments, if not heard at all. Some of the small orchestral details that are found in Zinman's recording are lost in Previn's, mostly because of the larger \\"echoes\\" in the acoustics. In the end, when intensity is gained, musical clarity is lost.<br /><br />If I had to choose between Zinman and Previn, I would go for the former. Zinman's recording is more moderately measured, and yet the clarity and the effective choice of tempos are appropriate. But even if Previn's recording of Eine Alpensinfonie is a bit flawed, it still has a lot to offer. If you want a purely energetic Alpensinfonie, then Previn is the one to buy.<br /><br />Grade: 8.7 out of 10e larger \\"echoes\\" in the acoustics. In the end, when intensity is gained, musical clarity is lost.  If I had to choose between Zinman and Previn, I would go for the former.

B006OAB3ME|5.0|I heard the complete CD for the first time last night, and I must say I strongly disagree with the negitive reviews!  There's no denying that Paul's voice is going -- Golden Slumbers on the Grammys was a painful reminder of that -- but he sounds great on these songs because he doesn't have to push so hard.  I don't suppose Sinatra would lose any sleep over this album, but Paul brings his own personality and feel to the tunes -- and they're all the better for it.<br /><br />Further, the arrangements and the songs themselves are gorgeous.  (Well, Inchworm was odd -- I didn't care for that at all, but otherwise I was really surprised at how much I loved this album.)<br />I would rank this as one of his best albums -- certainly better than his last few.  I like this better than anything since Flaming Pie.  It's different for him for sure, but it's intimate, emotional, rich.  Heck, it's just plain excellent.<br /><br />And those of you that give it one star because it's not \\"your kind of music\\" -- variety is the spice of life.  There's lots of great music out there beside rock & roll.

B0052U59F4|4.0|I was hesitant to download this book after the other reviews said it was twilight fan fiction.  I do love twilight, but I'd like to keep it Steph Myers way if you know what I mean.  Once I got into this story though, I discovered why it can be published without infringing copyright.  It has nothing to do with twilight!  Ok, there are some similarities in the main characters... but even that is pushing it.  This book stands on its own.  It is about a man who starts a D/s relationship with a very inexperienced girl.  From the beginning, though, both characters are challenging the normal boundaries of this kind of relationship, and its fun to watch them try to figure out exactly where they stand with each other.  Plenty of touching romantic parts are worked in between the very explicit D/s sex scenes.  All in all, sure to please any reader looking for some hot D/s action, or anyone with an open mind wanting a \\"not so traditional\\" romance story.

This book explained that and so much more.  What a remarkable story - this company started in some dorm room at standford and has risen to become almost its own superpower.  It kept me hooked just like my favorite mysteries and romance novels- never a dry or dull moment, and VERY educational.  All the stuff in this book applies to ALL OF US.  So READ IT.  You'll be glad you did.

0307946711|2.0|it was pure torture, I don't know why I even finished it.  The only reason I gave it two starts rather than one is it is very well written.  the characters were so aggravating to me, the male hero had NO redeeming qualities WHATSOEVER.  He was a COMPLETE TOOL.  The only good about him was the girl.  The girl was a little better than the boy, but not much.  I know enough whiney people in real life, I don't need to read about them, too.
0307474259|3.0|I first read Good Calories and Bad Calories and liked how well-annotated it was, and was not put off by its length. This book suffers from being too terse at times. A lot of assertions are made with minimal footnotes, so I had a harder time checking the sources. Still, I am in the process of following up on some of the claims and studies examined, and I am beginning to see that some of the conclusions drawn are not valid.  Example 1: The Cochrane review from 2001 that says there is insufficient data to conclude that lowering fat or saturated fat is healthy is irrelevant in lieu of a more recent Cochrane review indicating that there is evidence that lowering saturated fat is healthy.  Example 2: If you look up the A to Z Stanford study, you'll find that many researchers don't think its conclusions are valid because the subjects assigned to different diet groups did not follow the diet's guidelines. For example, the Atkins group ate too many carbs and were likely not in ketosis, and the Ornish group ate way too many total and saturated fats.  Example 3: Taubes argues that the obesity epidemic coincides with public health advice to eat less fat, but it ignores the increased incidence of corn syrup consumption, which recent research shows is metabolized differently than sucrose and is therefore more fattening even in smaller amounts. This shift to corn syrup (HFCS in particular) coincides with greater portions because corn syrup is less expensive and food can therefore be sold for less money. Instead of doing this, food manufacturers sell more food for slightly more money so people think they're getting a good deal.  The point is that refined carbohydrates are more of a problem than carbohydrates in general. Taubes's arguments aren't all invalid, but in light of the other ways in which the American diet has changed since the 70s, the conclusions he draws aren't cogent, nor is all the research cited unquestionable, and it's intellectually dishonest of him to be so thorough about picking apart the research that indicts saturated fat while pretending that the research on which his arguments are drawn don't also suffer from methodological flaws.  In the end, I have decided to limit carbohydrates across the board, but I'm examining the evidence to determine whether I'll stay on a ketogenic diet, and whether I can eat unrestricted amounts of saturated fat. If you read this book, follow up on the sources on which he makes his biggest claims.

1567184855|2.0|After reading this book, I felt a strong need to post a comment. For over 20 years I've read many books on everything from OBE's( out of body experience),Astral travel which is part of the obe experience, ufo's and life on the other side. I really had an interest in OBE Because I've had several myself. I thought journey of souls would be another good book to read . After reading this book I thought to myself ,In all my years of research ,I've never come across A book where the author states \\"The body can live without the soul up until the age of 5\\". Which is clearly not true. Once the breath enters the body the spirit is present. There is an etheric cord which is similar to an umbilical cord that connects the spirit or soul to the physical body. This gives the body life and spiritual vitality. Even when you have an OBE and you return to your physical body, that cord is still connected. Once that cord is severed, the body dies and the spirit moves on. Those who have studied or who have read many books on spirituality, know exactly what I'm talking about. Mr. Newton also states based on the feedback from one of his subjects/clients, your intuition comes from a separate entity in which he calls the soul. Once again, I disagree. You are that soul/spirit having a human experience. We all have an internal God given gift called intuition. Some are more open to this gift than others. The ones who are more open are called psychic. We also have spiritual guides and Angels that communicate with us through this intuitive channel. Mr Newton states He doesn't believe that there are evil spirits. He stated that sometimes spirits have a hard time adjusting to the human brain after incarnation. This may be the cause of human dysfunction. So i guess, some of the souls prior to incarnation, didn't take that part into consideration when they were choosing a body for the next life. But yet, we choose our parents and life lessons?? In closing, I will say, I feel this book is mixed with some truth and false information. I also feel Mr. Newton is a young soul himself. And you might ask how did I come to this conclusion? Mr. Newton stated on a video that was uploaded on youtube, that prior to his research in the area of soul travel, he was an Atheist. Meaning, he didn't believe in God. Does this mean he's a bad person? No. But I do feel, there is no way he could separate fact from fiction.. Especially since he didn't have much experience in the area of spirituality. Anyway, I wish Everyone Love & Light:)ome truth and false information. I also feel Mr. Newton is a young soul himself.

0393327345|4.0|I'm still trying to wrap my mind fully around all the various intricacies of Palahniuk's \\"Fight Club\\" opus.  One minute I like it a lot, the next minute I'm not certain how I ever managed to force my way through to the end.  No matter the case, there's definitely material here that makes you take notice - love it or hate it.  This is the most unique approach to the novel that I have 'witnessed' in some time!
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|Although I loved this movie, I also understand why so many people don't like it. The pacing is deliberately slow, building up tension for a brutal climax. Many people will see this as boring, being so accustomed to non-stop action & explosions that are supposedly the only testament to a movie being \\"exciting.\\" But this movie is all about leading up to this action; it's truly a story with many layers. In the place of filler dialogue, Gosling uses facial expressions to portray his emotions and set the movie's tone. In place of mindless and ridiculously over-the-top \\"action\\" that most movies substitute in place of an actual storyline, this movie builds on its plot and fully develops the characters before the shocking and graphic second half.<br /><br />The first half tries to prepare us (and even brace us) for what is to come; this tactic makes the second half intensely realistic and therefore all the more unsettling. I could write all day about the effective use of symbolism and foreshadowing (Driver asking Benicio if there are any good \\"sharks\\" and the subsequent handling of one of those \\"sharks\\" right after the T-bone car accident; Driver asking Bernie if he's ever heard of the story of the scorpion and the frog while wearing a scorpion jacket, giving us insight as to how he views himself) or the many interpretations of the movie's title (not just about his profession, of course).<br /><br />This movie doesn't give you everything on-screen; you have to dig deeper to figure some things out for yourself. It challenges us to be a smarter audience and to let the story naturally unfold on its own. The icing on the cake is the 80's stylized music, (truly the perfect backdrop for this movie!) which seamlessly adds to the other aspects of this film to create a flawless throwback and homage to true action movies.
B006ON41FC|4.0|Pretty fun game, and I'm glad Feint is included, it's like how Xbox Live keeps track of your scores and achievements, but only for Android!

B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This musical is a total joy to watch; I would not even try to count the number of times I've seen it but it always remains beautiful and lovely to watch and hear. This particular version is well planned and presented and seems to nicely capture the special nature of the 45th Anniversary of this fine work.<br /><br />It will need a special place on your shelf as it is not intended to simply fit in with all of your other discs; it is, however, worthy of the honor as it is beautifully executed and includes all of the special extras that come with the Blu-ray disc that make it truly a collectors choice.<br /><br />First of all, the quality of the Blu-ray disc itself is excellent; the video and the audio both are as close to perfect as I could imagine. There is absolutely nothing there that gets in between the viewer and the performance; Salzburg has never looked lovelier nor has Julie Andrews. In addition to the feature film there is a second Blu-ray disc devoted to additional special features. The fact that they are presented in Blu-ray is somewhat unusual as this kind of disc is often in a DVD format. There is a full version including special features in the DVD format on the third disc and a fourth disc which is a stereo CD of the soundtrack.<br /><br />There is a protective sleeve which shows the box to be part of a Limited Edition and gives the number assigned to your particular set. The inside box slips out of the sleeve and has a hinged top which opens upward to reveal a \\"Letter of Authenticity\\" from Twentieth Century Fox. On top is a large hardback book in full color called \\"A Few of our Favorite Things\\" which first tells the real story of the Von Trapp family in a section called \\"The Von Trapp Family: Separating Fact from Fiction.\\" It has many photographs of the real family and tells the actual story of their lives and adventures. One quickly discovers that considerable \\"artistic license\\" was taken as the script was written for the movie.<br /><br />The second section of the book is called \\"The origins of The Sound of Music\\" and describes the steps that eventually led to the movie version. It is the longest part of the book and covers the original book written in 1949 by Maria von Trapp, \\"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers,\\" it's progression to Broadway and its final progression to the screen. It is filled with interesting insights about the people and the process that made it all possible.<br /><br />Section 3 of the book is called \\"Salzburg: The City of Music\\" and along with some lovely pictures gives more information about the city, its history, and the locations where the movie was shot. The final short section of the book is called \\"The Legacy of The Sound of Music\\" and tells the story of the movie after its original release. All told, the book is a treasure and a worthy addition to the set; it will not be available for individual sale according to the inside back cover.<br /><br />Under the discs are two items, a reprint of the 1965 booklet which was available for sale at the 1965 rerelease of the movie, and a set of color photos of scenes from Salzburg.

B0072OFM28|4.0|Andy was not very strong as Spartacus, and I longed for a real atheletic,fierce person to play that role;however, this new guy is not the answer. John Hannah made the show and should have never died so soon.  It should have been a dream with Sparticus waking realizing his attempt would come up short.  If you are an athelete with an above average build you look for certain things that you would do or could do if given the opportunity.  I know I'm a harsh critic to most, but Andy was not very atheletic, nor was he built like a superior being. If Krixus did not look like such a brute, he could fill half the role. I hope they can find a way to bring John back.  As for as this new season, I will give it a chance by watching several times before my final review. Lesley is better than the new actress.

B000E5N62U|5.0|You know what? If you are going to judge the material on this CD by previous work, some with Steely Dan, then don't bother. This CD stands on it's own as a masterpiece. Evolve. Move on. Get over it. Whatever it is. This is fresh and impressive. It does complete a perfect trifecta. I will treasure this trilogy of works by Donald Fagen to my death. It is freakin' hard to produce this level of genuis. At any age, much less in your 60s. I want to throw up when I read negative crap such as some here have written. Great forever, these people could not write a single song that even remotely approach his genuis. If their life depended on it. Thank you Mr.Fagen for this CD. I only hope we are worthy. Obviously some are not.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|I was intrigued by the commercial for this concert and purchased it somewhat impulsively.  I just finished watching, came upstairs and read two reviewers who were significantly disappointed.  Not knowing I wasn't supposed to enjoy the concert, I was completely blown away....and I'm not even Irish.  Their voices are magnificent, the production is very imaginative, and the sound quality was superb.  I was fully entertained by the musicans, the dancers, the children, but especially the women (I fell in love instantly with Chloe.)  If those reviewers were disappointed by this performance, I really need to find out what they liked so much that now has them disappointed ...which would surely be my next purchase. I have over a hundred concerts on DVD, and I would definitely rate this one in the top ten.
0307956350|5.0|\\"The expats\\" by Chris Pavone follows Kate Moore, an ex-CIA spy who quits her job and moves to Luxembourg with her husband Dexter--who is forced to re-locate because of his job, which involves computer security for banks. While in Luxembourg, Kate befriends another ex-pat couple, designer Julia and her currency-trading, hunky husband Bill. As Kate makes a new life for herself and her sons in the gorgeous foreign land, she begins to suspect that her beautiful adventure has a secret side.  For one, Dexter spends entire days away from her in his office--but won't name the company he's working for, nor the details of his job. As Kate's friendship blossoms, she begins to suspect that Julia is not who she says she is. Gradually, hers and Bill's friendship becomes too close for comfort. And to further complicate matters, Kate becomes terrified that her CIA past might be catching up with her.  Throughout the book, Pavone jumps from the present to the future and there's some foreshadowing going on. But what I appreciated the most, is Pavone's beautiful descriptions of Western Europe (there's a lot of globe-hopping going on), tied in with the continuing suspense. I like suspenseful mysteries in exotic lands, and this book definitely held my interest.

B006ON41FC|5.0|it is so cool but I  keeps dying. so fun try it. best game ever.I like this game so much.
B006ON41FC|4.0|This game lags a little on my nook, but it's a really fun game. Why is everybody hating on open feint? There should be an option to enable or not though that's why I didn't give 5 stars otherwise the game is entertaining.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|great product, very light, great for hiking to keep my knifes sharp,,, works so well i took it into the kitchen and sharpened all my knifes in the drawer
B0054JZC6E|5.0|their just the challenge needed for my break at work. bring it in every day and people sit and watch me play.
B006ON41FC|1.0|I agree with most of the others.  If I happen to download a game and it requires Openfeint I will immediately delete it.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This runs great on my Kindle Fire. It's really fast, it adjusts how big the tiles are, and it's challenging. It keeps my mind going in between classes.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I didn't like this at first, but its really grown on me and become very addictive!!!! its easy to get lost in some of the fun games.
B005FNJL7K|4.0|As someone who purchased all three theatrical soundtracks, purchased all three complete recordings, and owns Symphony No. 1 by de Meij, you could easily classify me as a fan of Lord of the Rings music.  When I discovered this I was intrigued and I had questions.  How could one possibly reduce that many hours of glorious, soul stopping music into a six movement piece that still did it justice?  Well, Howard Shore has done so (almost).  I must say, being so devoted to the film music, I was a little nervous to listen to this.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.  I actually listened to this via youtube video (if you're curious like me I would suggest looking it up), and my first thought after a few bars was \\"Wow!  This is cool!\\"  I did however notice differences that were disappointing.  One thing is certain, there isn't quite the same \\"OOMPH!\\" behind the music as there is in the film music.  In this piece the vocals, as well as instrumentation, were a bit hollow sounding.  Not that they didn't sound great, but it just wasn't the same power as the score.  I would describe it, as my title says, as a new flavor of the LOTR music.  Familiar themes, good performances, but just not quite the same power.  When I put on my headphones to listen to the film music or to de Meij's Symphony No. 1, it's as if I'm transported to Middle Earth and the music soaks into my very soul.  This, however, did not illicit the same reaction.  One of my favorite themes in the film music (and de Meij) is the Journey Through the Dark/Mines of Moria/Bridge of Khazad-dûm; the music literally is so beautiful to me it brings me to tears.  My second favorite themes are the ones we encounter in Lothlorien.  Sorely disappointed with that one in this recording.  The chord hit at 44 seconds on the track \\"Caras Galadhon\\" on complete recordings gives me chills every time; not so here. The same themes in this are just lack-luster compared to the other incarnations.  Overall the pacing of this seemed way toofast in places throughout the piece.  Overall, I give this a 4/5 because I like it, but I do not love it.  I do not plan on purchasing, however, I will enjoy that  youtube video from time to time I'm sure.  It is a great piece, but considering there are the soundtracks and complete recordings out there, this pales in comparison.  Perhaps if I had not yet heard the other music I would give this a more positive review, but I can't put the other music out of my mind.  It is still Howard Shore and Lord of the Rings, just not as good as the real thing.  If anything, I thank this recording for deepening my love of the complete recordings/theatrical soundtracks.  (On a rather random side note, try playing tracks simultaneously.  It creates this awesome round-robin effect if you get it just right! Lothlorien and Foundations of Stone were both pretty awesome!)
0143119680|5.0|While studying at the Bodlein Library in Oxford, Diana Bishop calls up the manuscript Ashmole 782.  Little did she know how something as simple as that would change her life.  She was born a witch but she refuses to have anything to do with magic.  Suddenly Diana finds herself in the sights of witches, daemons, and even vampires.  Or, should I say, one swoon-worthy vampire.  When she finds herself being chased and even threatened by those who believe she knows the secrets of Ashmole 782, she'll find herself even more threatened by one vampire who may want more from her than just the contents of the manuscript.<br /><br />While the book itself is rather long (over 500 pages), the story felt anything but that.  I was intrigued by its characters, the witches, vampires, daemons, the mystery of Ashmole 782, and especially, the romance between Matthew and Diana.<br /><br />As a fan of paranormal romance, I think A Discovery of Witches is one of the best.  Diana is a strong, independent character and you can't help but love reading about how her perfect life gets turned upside down.  There was so much depth and individuality to all the characters that you meet that you instantly feel connected to many of them.  In spite of the paranormal aspects, they were very believable.<br /><br />While I did have some trouble half way through the story, I thought the research aspects were just a little overdone and wordy, I still found it to be a beautifully written novel delving into both history and the supernatural. I can see where some have compared it to an adult Twilight - but I also found it like Diana Gabaldon's epic Outlander.  In the end, I'd say it has a lot of both of these and fans of these types of novels will devour this one.  Masterfully told - I cannot wait for the next installment in the trilogy.
1594203334|3.0|I enjoyed this book but constantly kept yelling \\"duh!\\" at the author while reading it. I lived with a French family while studying abroad, but they did not have small children, so it was interesting to learn about French parenting perspectives. HOWEVER, I do think the author is overly enamored with the French way of doing things, especially since she oohs and aahs over the basic parenting techniques they use that are also used by most conservative parents in the U.S.: Hello? Saying hello and good-bye to guests is somehow revolutionary? I thought it was just basic manners. Not hitting your parents? Understanding that \\"no\\" means no and that parents who don't say it with authority are basically being laughed at not only by their disobedient kids but also by the adults around them?  We do not let rude children come to play in our house... period! We do everything we can to encourage our kids' relationships with like-minded kids and their families.  Having said that, I was particularly interested in the way children are fed in France, and that seemed to coincide with the style of eating I experienced while there. But being shocked that kids sit at the table and eat with their family? I don't think so!  Also, I was more than a little unnerved by the author's seeming love affair with the socialistic French society that aims to groom little French statesmen from the earliest of years (through government daycare). Also, you'll notice that while she describes how great it is to have socialized medicine, she also notes the difference in care between public and private hospitals, having delivered children in both. I gave birth under socialized medicine as well (in Canada, where private hospital care is illegal) and can tell you that there are few things more horrific.  My last comment is one of wonder at how the supposedly \\"middle class\\" parents in France that the author describes somehow have enough money for full-time round the clock nannies and multiple apartments in Paris that they hire architects to renovate for them. This is hardly the same middle class existence we find here in the States. And while not letting children be the center of the universe and control your life is a good thing, I'm sorry but farming your kids out to strangers so that you can have \\"adult time\\" does not constitute my idea of a good parent.  All in all it's an interesting read, but just know that you need to use your critical thinking skills here and not take everything at face value.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I like the shell. It's compcat and fits the Fire perfectly. I like the stand for the horziontal position. I wish that I could stand the Kindle up in the vertical position.
B006ON41FC|4.0|Didn't make me opt in to anything, just a little fun casual game. I turned the sound down on my device so no problem there.  OUT OF THE ASHES AND ONTO YOUR FIRE
B006ON41FC|4.0|This is a fun game. I like trying to get all of the different challenges. It's nice that they get harder as you go along.
B0058VW36U|3.0|I had no issues downloading and opening it on my Kindle Fire. The game was fun at first but I quickly got bored. Not a bad game though...
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|AAB stands for Awesome Angry Birds!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This was the first app I got on my KFire. u don't need wifi 2play and there's barely any ads its a great app

0545425115|5.0|I admit that I wasn't too excited when my book club picked this book as our next read. I'd heard just enough about the plot to make me nervous. Kids killing each other, really? I'm supposed to read this for entertainment?<br /><br />I gave it a chance, and found it to be a riveting and compelling read. Violence is integral to the plot, but it's not gruesome or drawn out. This is no celebration of violence, but rather a story about what it means to be human in the face of violence.  I left with a deep emotional attachment to the characters, and a concern for their welfare living under a government  that keeps its society in check by forcing children into a life-and-death struggle on live TV. Questions are raised about the dehumanizing effect on the audience of watching these gladiator-like games -- apt questions in our world of reality TV shows.<br /><br />Parents, certainly this is one to read and discuss alongside your son or daughter. But I would rank it as similar to the later Harry Potter books in terms of intensity and violence. This is a dystopia, so it's meant to be disturbing, but the tone is similar to [[ASIN:B004V2AWKG The Giver]] -- not [[ASIN:0060850523 Brave New World]].
B0073LWEXK|5.0|The graphics are really nice. This is a storymode game meaning you done get points or anything, you just go along the story finding new objects, uncovering clues, and solving puzzles. Some parts are tricky but if you get stuck there's a hint guide. Over all its a fun game and I enjoyed playing it.
B005VT42BS|5.0|Great app. Works as expected, and is very stable. Allows you to name devices, which is quite handy when you need to find a device in a list of several hundred.
B004EPYZSK|2.0|Was just OK.. I've seen better. Seen one you have seen them all.. Just made it in to cowboys and???..  Amazon did a fast job shipping..
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game, its colors are vivid and bright.Though it needs to be updated for MORE levels it has a variety of which you can choose from. I absolutely love the diff. stages and the difficult levels. I advice anyone to buy it; great price for this amazing game.

076532413X|3.0|Let me start by saying I watched the ABC series FlashForward before reading the book, and as I was disappointed that the series was cancelled I decided to read the book.  First off, the book is set in a completely different situation than the series. I knew this before reading the book, but one can't help but anticipate some parallels from the show that never appeared in the book.  I love the concept. It is something every one of us thinks about at least at some point in their lives.  The writing on the other hand is a little lacking (not to mention at least one factual error that I picked up on, and multiple typos in the version I read). While Sawyer goes into significant detail on some issues, the book lacks the suspense that could only be achieved by going into more details in the more important issues.  The leaning towards superficial really becomes obvious towards the end of the book. To me it felt like he was late for a lunch date when he wrote the final 4-5 chapters.  Still I recommend the book for the concept and the discussion within it.
B006ON41FC|5.0|5 stars I love it so much rerry I love it I like it.its so fun I love it so much it was fun
B006ON41FC|3.0|It's a cute game cause when I play it...when my cat hears it...She runs over and watch and paws at the screen and its really cute and funny all at the sametime she's likes and I like and 3 stars all the way.
B006ON41FC|4.0|Anyone bitching about using open feint why does it matter?  Might help to I don't know review the actual game which is what this is supposed to be.  As for sound, yeah its a real tough one.  Might want to try selecting pause and just turn off sound.  Crazy concept I know.
0062082353|5.0|Excellent book, a good look at the war from someone who had boots on the ground.  If you liked reading about Carlos Hathcock Jr. you will like this book.  It is a exciting read, but also with heartfelt pieces from his wife.  I commend the individuals in Texas and around the country whom are donating time, land, etc. to help veterans regain their composure after the torments of war.  Great Job Chris, thank you for bringing out so many different sides of before, during, and after and individual serves their country during war time.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|I bought this cd because I liked the song Just A Kiss . I thought it was great song and I was wondering what the rest of the songs sounded like on the cd.  I am glad that I had bought this cd. I have been playing the cd over and over.  I would highly recommend this cd.
0312641893|4.0|A futuristic cyborg retelling of Cinderella sounds outrageous, but Marissa Meyer really takes the timeless tale and makes it her own with CINDER, first of a four-book series. Imaginative and action-packed, with likable characters, CINDER will appeal to readers looking for a dose of creative adventure.<br /><br />In the future city of New Beijing, Cinder works as a talented young mechanic, but her status as a cyborg and ward of her stepmother means that she is trapped. When a mysterious and deadly plague touches her family, Cinder is thrown into the paths of members of the royal palace, including the handsome and caring Prince Kai. There may be something about Cinder that will be the key to finding a cure for the plague, but will Cinder ever be regarded by anyone as more than simply a cyborg?<br /><br />Where do I start in gushing about how enjoyable CINDER was? Cinder the protagonist was a lovely protagonist. She is smart, resourceful, and brave. Cinder belongs in that small group of YA heroines who do not possess any extraordinary survival tactics and yet is a fighter: she deals with her troubles in a way that many of us can imagine us doing if we were ever in her position.<br /><br />My next point is contentious, as many great reviewers have felt this part underdeveloped, but I felt that CINDER did a great job of creating a unique future world. No, it's not quite a dystopian, and it's not \\"hard\\" sci-fi: if it were either of those, the world's connections to our present-day world would need to be more convincing. However, I was able to enjoy CINDER's setting of New Beijing as almost a fantasy world, set on a planet with a similar layout to ours, with new technology but similar problems of politics and society. Story and setting complemented each other well: the plot never dragged in order to appease world-building, and the world-building was enough such that the story was supported well.<br /><br />Overall, CINDER may not win any literary awards in the near future, but it is an utterly enjoyable retelling of a classic in a futuristic fantasy world, with recognizable elements from the old tale but enough new elements to keep things fresh. I was surprised at the abruptness of the ending, until I learned that the Lunar Chronicles is a four-part exploration all about Cinder and her adventures, not separate stories each. Oh. Okay. There will be resolutions in the future, then! You can bet I'll be tuning in to the next books in this fun series.g of a classic in a futuristic fantasy world, with recognizable elements from the old tale but enough new elements to keep things fresh.

B0064NTZQ2|3.0|We meet Ryan as a wheelman (getaway driver) for some thieves.The toughest part of this movie is not getting to see what is going on inside. Somehow somebody knows what he is driving so the police are after him, he pulls into the Staples Center at the end of a basketball game. Uh, I think the gates would all be for out-bound traffic, oh well.  Next we see he is a Hollywood stunt car driver, oh, he wears a police uniform, ironic? He goes home where he has...nothing.  He meets his next door neighbor lady who has a son, ahhh. They all spend a nice day together, he drives a 1973 Chevelle, does not appear to be an SS.  Then, the lady's husband returns from prison, ahh, turmoil.  Turns out guys from prison want the recently released guy to rob a...pawn shop (?) for the protection he got in prison.  So, to protect them Ryan will drive, ahh.  Well, shoot out, car chase it all goes wrong, they get followed and Ryan alone ends up with 1 million $, turns out there was mob $ there.  Ron Perlman channels Al Pachino of [[ASIN:B000ID37SQ Scarface (1983)]] spouting the word for no reason and racial terms when he can. He and Albert Brooks were going to sponsor Ryan as a racecar driver, he ALSO works as a mechanic, busy guy, where does his money go?  A bloody second half along with the required trip to a strip-club, perhaps the most worthless use of naked women as they sit around topless like wallpaper as Ryan punches out a guy.  In the end almost everybody is dead. Perhaps check out [[ASIN:B0007ZEOC8 The Driver]] if you wish to see this type of entertainment. Leave this in the Red Box bin.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|I kind of bought this on a whim, as I really like doing artsy things in my spare time.  It's a great concept and it seems like it'll be a lot of fun.  I've only used it once but it seems to work pretty well.  In my research on-line it appears it's fairly difficult to 'get the hang of it' and there are so many different methods to use and types of glass to experiment on etc., that I don't have my hopes up in expecting it to work perfect every time.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|If you haven't seen this, you are missing out.  Granted, not all viewers appreciate stories of this type, but if you are taking the time to look at the reviews, then surely you will love it as much as the rest of us !!!  This is just simply one of the most enjoyable shows I've seen in years.
0525478817|5.0|This book lived up to its hype.  John Green wrote a book that made me go on the emotional roller coaster with the characters.  I loved every minute of it.  I actually did not cry that much during the book since I essentially guessed what was going to happen.  But the letter at the end tipped me over!  So beautiful and elegant!  I am so glad I bought this book so I can read it over and over and over!
B001LRJH0U|5.0|This movie is among my favorites.  If you enjoy true, honest dialog between characters, then you will appreciate this movie.  There is no Hollywood hype to be found.  This movie reminded me of Silverado, The Lonesome Dove series and Open Range.  I felt like I was \\"there\\".  The story centers on a longtime friendship, and trusting relationship of two very likable characters from the old West.  These two men had no angst or meaningless internal struggles with right and wrong.  There are no \\"comedy of errors\\" or \\"hidden plot twists\\" for the audience to endure. (thankfully).  The story moves along at an acceptable speed, and you never have to make excuses for your favorite character.  If it takes explosions and filthy language to excite your movie watching, then you will be disappointed.  But if you like a good story, then you should consider this movie.
0671027344|3.0|It seemed like everytime something happens in the book, Charlie cries.  After reading the ending, I get why he cries so much, but it was still a bit annoying.  This would have been a great book otherwise, but it's too close to The Catch in the Rye.  The writing and the characters remind of me of the more superior Salinger novel.  And most of the time, remakes are not as good.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I totally love it! it's awesome I like it because you have to make your squirrel glide and it is really fun

B005QUQP76|2.0|PROS:<br />- Very sturdy build quality<br />- 8 programmable buttons<br />- Fits great in the hand<br />- Smooth glide<br />- High potential for adjusment<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Software/customization is lacking<br /><br />I've used a Logitech G9x for several years and been very happy with it overall. My only complaints were that it was very low profile, causing hand fatigue, and I often found myself wishing I had another thumb button.<br /><br />The Corsair M60 solves both of those problems, but has a few glitches of it's own.<br /><br />The build quality, glide, fit and feel of the mouse are excellent. The addition of a third mouse button is great for FPS gamers without having too many extra buttons as many MMO mice do.<br /><br />The only real issue I have with this mouse so far is the fact that the software needed to customize the mouse... well, it kinda sucks right now (currently on 2.12 BETA release at the time of this writing). The installation of the software was buggy (wouldn't recognize the mouse as being plugged into a USB port), the options are very limited and some of the options that do exist don't function properly. Reprogramming the mouse buttons to your liking is almost pointless until they fix the software. Macros are reportedly very buggy and mapping keystrokes doesn't work at all for me.<br /><br />As always, the support from Corsair is top-notch, so I don't expect any of these issues to remain outstanding for too long. As soon as the software side gets tweaked, this will be the FPS mouse to beat.<br /><br />UPDATE 7/19:<br /><br />I'll preface this by saying that Corsair's reputation for customer service has always been excellent, and I have not been disappointed... until now.<br /><br />Five months later, the software for this mouse is still utterly lacking. While the mouse itself is holding up well, it is hamstrung by the lack of basic features and functionality in the software. Profile support is an afterthought, keybinding and playback arebuggy and inconsistent from one program to the next. Corsair refused for months to provide even an estimate on how long it would be before update software was released, leading customers like myself to bank solely on the company's reputation for support. My window for returns is long-passed, and Corsair support for this product doesn't look to be improving much in the near future. Great mouse, terrible software support and conspicuoulsy-lacking customer support. For the headache it's been so far, I wish I could get my money back.<br /><br />Deducting two of the original four stars I gave this mouse.
B005NFJAT4|5.0|The following review only applies to my edition of the movie Gettysburg on Blu-ray (in comparison to my edition of the movie Gettysburg on DVD):  The Blu-ray definitely has a sharper image than the DVD. However, it also has a darker image. Thus some of the extras in the background--and even at times, a few of the faces of the actors in the foreground--that you would see on the DVD are little more than shadows on the Blu-ray. I thought about giving the Blu-ray only a 4-star rating for that reason. However, the darker image is far more realistic and dramatic.  The description on Amazon about the product does not specially say that the Blu-ray is an extended version. However, there are a number of scenes from the movie on the Blu-ray that were not on the DVD.  The description on Amazon says the Blu-ray is a 2-disc edition (as the DVD was). However, the Blu-ray is a 1-disc edition.  The photo of the Blu-ray displayed on Amazon shows a black case. However, the jewel case that came with my edition is the standard blue. [BTW I intentionally avoided the book packaging edition, knowing that the cardboard case would eventually soil, ding, warp, and peel.]
B006ON41FC|1.0|All I want is to be able to play the game without the social media crap.  I have no idea if the game is good because not having a choice about OpenFeint means my choice is no game.  I am so feed up with this. situation that I am going to start automatically passing on any game with a connection to OpenFeint, regardless whether or not it is optional.  Developers - work for free because I will not be purchasing anything with an OF component.
B004R13U6Y|2.0|yes, it is a decent enough Pdf viewer. BUT I purchased it for the annotation features and those are severely lacking. The main problem -- text annotations are saved with an obscure and arcane XFDF format. What is that? Completely useless? You need Adobe Acrobat Pro to decipher it. I've contacted unidocs about it several times but they've never responded.  Also, the app should save settings with each pdf. So if I set horizontal lock on a document, it should reopen with it saved so I don't have to go through the hassle of it everytime.  Fix these two things and I'll gladly bump up my rating to four stars.

Plus, at no point in the movie was I so bored that I just needed to walk away; quite the opposite - it seemed to keep me hooked from beginning to end.<br /><br />To put it simply, to anyone who hasn't seen this movie - I'd HIGHLY recommend it. :D

B005HJWWW8|1.0|Total, absolute junk.  Garbage.  Never worked.  Never came close to working.  No support.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Like you, I had never heard of this book or its author but it was so highly rated and sounded so interesting and unique, I had to download it to my kindle.  I read many books in many different genres and I am always looking for the next great story.  The Wool Omnibus delivered, exceeding all my expectations.  You enter an underground world that is immediately unique and fantastical but also very recognizable in the everyday questions and struggles faced by the Silo's citizens. I tore through the first 4 books and then started forcing myself to slow down in a vain effort to stave off ever finishing book 5 and reaching the end of the story. The only silver lining is that this author has more books and I plan on reading them all as I continue to hope for Wool 6. If you are a reader, then trust a fellow reader and buy this book.

1609611543|4.0|Very enlightening! I now know that wheat is added to virtually all processed foods, and that today's genetically modified wheat is extremely unhealthy and even a little dangerous. It takes gluten sensitivity to a whole new level. \\"Healthy\\" whole grain bread has a higher glycemic index than table sugar? That's bad news. The biochemical and hormonal changes caused by eating wheat create insatiable food cravings and a wide range of illnesses. Think you'll eat the new gluten free baked goods instead of the standard wheat-based varieties? Think again. They will wreak the same kind of havoc with your health. Since reading this book, pancakes have taken on a sinister appearance to me.
B000ION23A|4.0|Movies like The Ant Bully make people like me, who have never lived in the U.S, get some insight into their culture. Technology, science, literature, food etc are elements the sum of which is Culture. There was a time when In...dians used to tell tales of emotion, propriety, balance, repect-for-nature etc through parables like the Jatak Kathaiyan (Jataka Tales). This is what The Ant Bully does and in a contemporary way. The idea itself, where we are made to realise that we must respect nature and that even the tiniest living beings can teach us much and can sensitise us to their and our own needs, is universal and connects immediately with people across borders and age groups. The quality of animation is respectable. The dialogues are tight and the situations exciting.

B002ZG994U|3.0|When I watch a popular movie which disappoints, I tend to check its box office report just to see if other people liked it. It does not influence my opinion but perhaps makes me realise how unique my sensibilities are.<br />In this case I did not even bother to do that. This movie proves that sometimes it is best not to re-invent a hit TV series. Some stories are best suited for a particular format and this one is perhaps best left to the small screen. The reason why I am writing this review is the girl who plays Sosa in the movie. It is to warn you that coming within 50 metres of any of her movies can put the filmophile in you at grave risk of extinction. If there were any awards for acting-dud, she would get all 5 nominations. She is such a histrionic-wimp that she would express and talk exactly the same way if she were playing a housewife, secretary, lover, anything. Predictably stupid and with a weird name, Sosa. So\\"sa-d\\".
0316066524|5.0|I'm ordinarily a pretty fast reader, so I imagined I would be able to knock this out in a week or two. Boy, was I wrong. And I have to say I've seldom been happier to be wrong. Infinite Jest is one of those books that takes time to get it's hooks fully into you, but when it does it's hard not to be completely in thrall to it. I'm not even sure it's a novel as much as it is a holistic intellectual commitment the way most German Philosophers and some long-running HBO television series are. I found myself actively wondering about the characters, the structure, the chronology, the footnotes, and in general just puzzling over this bizarre, fractured little world like it was my own. Wallace has syntactical prowess out to *here* and I feel like you don't read these sentences as much as you just navigate them and sort of pull them through with you, filling in the little ellipses, argots and inside jokes as you go along. And yet in spite (or perhaps because) of all of the rich stylistic exploration, Wallace is able to create compelling, humane characters, often in the span of just a few pages. And what's more, is often able to make them so real so valid, and often so sad, that they could almost wander off and become little novels of their own. It IS worth the effort.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Americans are perhaps worse than Indians when it comes to corruption for they have legalised it by calling it lobbying. From top CEOs to treasury secretaries to directors of regulatory bodies to academicians were steeped in corruption and were willingly involved in bringing about the global economic disaster of 2008, the shocks of which are still being felt. This movie is an eye opener to how things work in the USA and how even a well meaning Obama failed to do anything about it. The moral of the movie is - Greed is NOT good.<br />The biggest shock was how iconic institutes like Harvard etc were not only privy to the crime but also were party to it. There is much that Indian bureaucrats need to learn from what the americans did NOT do so that we may insulate our economy from such crimes.<br />It is depressing top executives of global giants like Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers etc looted their own people and global citizens alike to feed their vices with impunity and how, as usual, it was the \\"aam aadmi\\", the Joe, who was made to foot the bill. This is a must watch documentary and will surely make you get a yucky feeling for B-Schools' methods to disseminate propoganda so that their coffers remain full. I have myself always hated financial companies' excesses because they really do not care about the investors and always try and sell them products where the company makes a \\"kill\\". They should be very closely regulated by a government which does NOT depend on their money to run its election campaigns. The big business - politician nexus is a disease rampant in all democracies and our politicians' eagerness to install nuclear power plants everywhere is a good example of that. This documentary forces us to look inwards and to ask oursleves a simple question - do we need all that we consume these days? Does that make us happier and wiser than the generations before us? Is Greed good?<br />This should be taught in schools and in colleges that consumption is desirable only till a certain level. Owning 5 homes when one has a family of 3 is Greed. And Greed, my friends, was always, is and will always remain BAD.ain level. Owning 5 homes when one has a family of 3 is Greed. And Greed, my friends, was always, is and will always remain BAD.
1439156816|4.0|I've never read King before, and this is obviously not representative of his work. What it is however, is a pretty decent mini-memoir/writing guide which covers the basics of both categories without wallowing unnecessarily in either. I always think of King as this interminably successful pop author. I can literally never recall a point in my life when I didn't walk into a bookstore and see a new (or reprinted) Steven King bestseller somewhere. So it was really interesting reading about his early years basically just being this working class 20 something guy living in different parts of rural Maine. And anyone who could support a wife and two kids at that age working an endless succession of dead end jobs and still have time left over to write anything at all is not someone you can entirely dismiss out of hand. If he comes across as a bit too cocky, it's also quickly obvious that its a sort of cockiness he's earned and at least he doesn't rub your face in it.  The sections on writing itself seemed pretty basic. Not Strunk and White soulless beige cubicle basic, but basic to anyone whose ever sat through multiple composition/creative writing classes (guilty as charged). But then most really good writing advice is. And the voice he uses is engaging enough to make you not care when he's stating the dumbly obvious. By far the best section is towards the end when he discusses the auto accident that nearly killed him in '99. It walks this really fine line between being gruesome, poignant and funny. And that's hard to pull off in fiction, much less when writing about real life. It actually made me want to sit down and bother to read some of his books. Oh yeah, and it made me want to write too.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|After using several other productivity suites.  I keep coming back to OfficeSuite Pro 5; This isn't perfect but it's good stuff!
0307949508|3.0|Marginally better than the first one in the series. The prose is still clunky, he still summarizes too much, and there are still too many characters to really keep track of/care about, but at least here they have something to do. And the book wisely chooses to focus most of its attention on Ms. Salander and how everyone gets drawn into her fractured, violent, pointedly unheroic life. In fact, it seems like for roughly half the population of Sweden, uncovering the truth about Lisbeth is a chance to either:<br />a) show off their sterling moral rectitude<br />b) redress their grievances against her with unhealthy revenge fantasies<br />This leads to some pretty hopeless side plots. I find it hard to believe that anyone cares about the office politics of Stockholm crime investigators accept for said investigators. There's also a bizarre fight between a pro boxer and a neo-nazi man-child, a brief examination of the joys and strains (though really, mostly joys) of being a sexually liberated, modern Scandinavian, a tropical storm in Granada, shopping trips to IKEA, oh, and milk cartons. Got that?<br />But the real thematic backdrop of the book is still violence against women, only this time it actually has some weight to it because we finally see how that violence has been so pivotal in shaping the only genuinely interesting character around. And when the truth finally comes to the surface, it does actually feel sort of sad. It's good enough to make you want to read the last one, but only just.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|its a fabulous app. enjoy it thoroughly. it has helped me az an author, for when I happen to be on the go and wanting to jot things down. love it.
006091307X|4.0|I've never read Pynchon before, but his style, those winding, iridescent sentences seem like an important reference point for a lot of American authors who come after him, people like Don Delillo, Donald Barthelme, David Foster-Wallace, Johnathan Franzen, Neal Stephenson, William Gibson etc. He's able to synthesize obscurant historical references, pop culture, conspiratorial paranoia and drug use into this funky, swirling melange. It would almost be a kind of metaphysics, if it wasn't so kooky and consistently playful. Reading this, it feels like someone peeling off the surface of postwar American life, showing you this messy, bizarre, occasionally terrifying blend of forces that might have it in for you, or might just be yanking your chain. Or maybe both.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is perfect especially if you want something to do I give this like one million stars love it
0142000655|5.0|I literally could not put this down. Loose biblical parables have been around forever in literature, but what makes this so great is that it never just cops out by reducing down to one. Maybe the characters are fated or whatever, but they're also among the strongest characters he's written. Who wouldn't want to sit down for a beer with someone like Sam Hamilton or Lee? Who wouldn't want to claw out Cathy Ames's eyes? Who wouldn't want to offer some kind of reassurance to someone like Caleb Trask? A lot of sprawling, multi-generational family novels tend to collapse under their own weight, but Steinbeck is able to ground his so thoroughly in the regional sensibilities and culture of turn of the century California that you never loose a sense of what's happening or why it matters. Forget the Joads and forget George and Lennie, this is the Steinbeck book everyone should read.

0307949486|3.0|The girl with the dragon tattoo manages to be an okay thriller in spite of itself. The set up takes forever, the list of characters and all of their sick, crazy interrelations approaches Tolstoy length, and either Larsson's prose is clunky and ridden with the sort of cliches most people know to avoid by the time they are fifteen, or maybe his translator just can't pull the weight. The book is at its best when its dealing with Lisbeth Salander, who is interesting because she's inscrutable and refuses to be a 'good guy,' not in spite of it. And through the book there is a constant backdrop of female violence and humiliation in a society that prides itself on its egalitarian social and economic policies. The book's original title is if anything, too obvious. Man Who Hate Women. And how. Larsson can't seem to make up his mind if he wants to write crime thrillers or if he wants to moralize, so instead he tries to do both at once. Which apparently is what makes you an international best seller. Who knew?
B003VQCSN2|1.0|Talk about ending with a whimper. Hornet's Nest is a complete mess. Too many new, useless characters that exist purely to fulfill a function in the ridiculous, overwrought plot, and waaaay too much recapitulating what happened in the second book. And worst of all, this whole legion of new characters and intrigues means that Lisbeth, the only redeeming feature of these books, keeps getting pushed to the side. This is the fault of the publisher more than anything, the third book feels like it was rushed into print before any even halfway competent editor had the chance to actually read it. If you desperately want to know how everything ends, just gloss the wikipedia summary, the girl who kicked the hornet's nest isn't worth the time it takes to read.

Don't hesitate to buy this, totally worth it...
B0000024W3|4.0|This album is about Bob Dylan the Musician, not Bob Dylan the angry, finger-pointing, folk ballad writer.  It has been derided for failing to live up to the expectations of his fans--who wanted one thing only from him--much to Bob's personal dislike.  Now it's 2012, the same year that an all star cast has put together a four CD collection of his music.  It's about time Bob Dylan the Musician no longer has to prove himself to anyone.  This album is Americana at it's finest, and Bob enjoying himself the way only a Musician in the studio can do--every nuance coming through in his voice.  I can hear the \\"whoop\\" of Charlie Feathers coming through, the ghost of Woodie Guthrie, the influence of Johnny Cash...all that is there and more.  Even without Bob Dylan's voice present, this would be an incredible album with some of America's finest musicians (just look at the credits!).  I give this four stars instead of five only for one reason: some of the criticism is fair.  The live tracks deserved much better sound quality.  As for Bob's performance itself...well, I think it's true he probably picked some of these tracks deliberately to tick people off, especially bootleggers if you are to believe the folklore surrounding it.  But even still, those tracks aren't there to try the listener's patience, but to capture, warts and all, this Self Portrait.  This isn't just Bob's self portrait, its the Listener's self portrait.  That in itself is brilliant, karma for the critics that is better late than never.
1594744769|4.0|I really enjoyed this!  When I purchased it I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into.  The pictures and the written description were amazing!  How often do we really get to picture the characters and places that we are reading about.  I am anxious for the next installment (as the ending of the book was an obvious set up for book 2) to see what Mr. Riggs has in store for us.
0307352145|4.0|I would have given this book 10 stars based on the first half of the book, which i devoured and thoroughly enjoyed! About half way into the book she went political. It wasn't an issue most agree on, but a hot button issue. A chapter on introverted politicians may have been a better way to go, but in general i read to take a break from news and politics. I found myself skimming a little after that, and while the book did pick up some momentum, the second half seemed a little scattered, and at times dry. Having the book smaller, and integrating her personal thoughts on education etc into the first half may have left, atleast this reader, more satisfied. I was going to give this book 3 stars, but gave it 4 instead because the first half was still worth the purchase price! Alot of great information in this book, especially for educators. Recommend with the above reservations:)

B002RKSXJG|4.0|ok so i thought this was a great book.it was interesting well written and had gripping drama. i loved how it had some humorous characters and how well the characters were deleloped was great to. i am a kid that really likes a lot of humor (good humor, that is) in books. so i really loved how theh had the creepy/mystery element to it but it also had just those great characters that were interesting and some of them funny. the only reason j am giving this book a four star is because it got just a little bit slow nearer the end.

But really, I think that this guy should stick to kids books. He is totally incapable of writing anything creepy or mystery~like. This book is lame and poorly written. I was looking for something creepy and fun and this was NOT. Enough said...
B005VPRETE|5.0|My daughter just received this toy in the mail from her Grandma. She was excited when she opened the box to see the tree house.<br />Having buckets of legos growing up and spending countless hours building things, I think this set is a prefect idea for little girls. The color picture directions are clear and easy to follow. My 3 year old even helped with the building of it. She loves the interchangeable girls with all their accessories. This is a must buy if you grew up building legos and have a little girl. Pieces are nicely constructed just just like the \\"boys\\" set with more pastel colors. Any negatives are the same they were when I was a kid; small pieces, hard to transport, sometimes pieces stick, easy to lose pieces. Will be adding other Friends sets to this with this.<br /><br />Pros-<br />Easy to build<br />Nice construction<br />Great colors<br />Dolls are a nice touch with the interchangeable items and more life like figure<br /><br />Cons-<br />Same as always with legos

0307888908|5.0|Steve Jobs once called Apple the \\"biggest start-up on the planet\\". Because of its success at systemizing disruptive innovation, it is the most scrutinized company in the world, especially by its competitors. As secretive as Apple is, there are plenty of books and articles that examine Apple's culture in great detail. So why are most companies -- especially large, established corporations -- incapable of applying these principles themselves?  I bring up this question because the first time I read this book, I was disappointed. So many of the strategies seemed so intuitive, so obvious, that I didn't feel like I had gleaned as much insight as I had hoped. But as I looked over my highlights, I realized that, like Apple's competitors, I'd missed the point.  What you need to adapt to the changing world of work aren't cheap tactics and off-the-wall ideas and quick fixes to hack your career. Often, the best ideas *do* seem obvious and familiar. But what is less obvious and less familiar and, thus, is arguably more important and more useful, is a framework or blueprint or system that makes it easier to build the habits required to consistently and sustainably implement those ideas with every decision you make, day in and day out.  The framework this book offers is this: you must think and act like you're running a start-up.  But what does that mean? Here's an example. One deceptively simple philosophy in the book is the idea of helping first -- that you should find ways to create value for others before seeking value for yourself. It's so simple and obvious that it's easy to gloss over it, and yet, it is fundamental to every successful entrepreneur or start-up in the world, because you'll never get a single customer until you solve a problem for someone.  So how does one apply this philosophy? Here's what Reid does: whenever he gets the chance, he asks a simple question again and again and again: \\"How can I help?\\" Think about it: It sounds simple, and yet most people don't approach their careers or their relationships with this empathetic mindset. How often do you find ways to solve problems for the people around you? And if it isn't often, how do you change that? What habits does Reid have that you need to do this, too?  \\"The Start-up of You\\" will give you Reid Hoffman's -- and Silicon Valley's -- secret sauce, but it's not enough to know it, just like it isn't enough for Apple's competitors to know its philosophies. You have to understand that an entrepreneurial mindset requires different habits of thought and action. This is what the authors mean when they say you have to think and act like you're running a start-up. If you were running a start-up, how would you create a culture that instills the habits of thought and action you want your people to have?  Well, it turns out you *are* running a start-up: your career. How do you train yourself to have the habits of thought and action you need to thrive in the 21st century?  Or, put another way, what would an entrepreneur do?

B005SFR7YE|4.0|The 25th Anniversary performance of Phantom of the Opera, staged in Royal Albert Hall in London was, in my opinion, very good.  I watched it in a theater in Florida on October 2nd and was impressed by what was accomplished in that huge concert hall.  Was it the same experience as attending a performance at the Majestic Theater in New York?  No.  However, one must expect that adjustments had to be made given the venue.  Let's face it, there is no fly space, no wings, a large expanse, etc. which make it impossible to stage the production as would be done in a theater.  Once a viewer accepts that it will be a different presentation, it is most enjoyable.  I am glad to have, at last, a complete recording of the show. This is the only one that exists for the general public.  Is it perfect? No, but this was a live performance in a huge hall, with a huge audience with many set adjustments.  The actors were, for the most part, quite good.  Ramin was an fairly good Phantom, but not the best I have heard sing the role.  His pitch, at times, was a bit off.  Sierra was a fine Christine.  She had moments which were spectacular!  Her \\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again\\" was amazing.  The sexual energy she exuded  in \\"Past The Point Of No Return\\" was very special.  The role of Carlotta was very well played and stood out in this production.  Overall, the cast was quite good.  Thank God there were no \\"former boy band stars\\" cast in this production as was the case in the Les Miserables 25th Anniversary concert.  The DVD is worth the price for anyone who loves the Phantom of the Opera. My only  hope is that, someday, Mr. Webber and Mr. Mackintosh will release a DVD of the actual show performed in an actual theater.  There are several ALW shows for which this has been done (Joseph, Cats) but these shows were not Phantom.  Phantom of the Opera is clearly Mr. Webber's high water mark.  I doubt that it will be released while it is still such a huge success in theaters.  \\"In the mean time, ladies and gentlemen, we shall be giving you the DVD performance from Royal Albert Hall.\\"

1593083793|4.0|I picked up this Hesse classic on my Nook after a recommendation from a friend. I had never read Hesse and knew nothing of the book's history before reading although I had studied some basic Buddhism in college. In a sense the college work gave me a nice base from which to think a little deeper about some of the concepts Hesse presents through this wonderful story. But, I think one with no prior knowledge of Buddhist beliefs could still stand to gain much from this book. The book is a nice read, well written and just the right length I think for Hesse to present his story. Not too complex and yet not too simple. I highly recommend it.

B004WCTLNY|2.0|Matt Damon is a terrific actor and he's starred in a wide range of exceptional movies.<br /><br />THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU ain't one of them.<br /><br />This eclectic hodge-podge of a mess never finds its footing or its message; Damon plays an up and coming Congressman with limitless potential, yet when he falls in love by a chance encounter with a dancer (Emily Blunt) he suddenly finds mysterious obstacles thrown onto his path to keep him from seeing her again.  And these aren't run-of-the-mill obstacles, by golly, these are the shenanigans of the Adjustment Bureau, metaphysical G-Men who pop out of doors (wormholes) throughout Brooklyn and Manhattan to create nonsensical mischief.  Why?  Because, of course, the young Congressman will not stay true to 'The Plan' (and the Bureau, with its 'administrator', has high aspirations for the young pol, of course) if he spends his life with the girl of his dreams.  So Damon's character, once the Bureau lets him in on their secret (at the risk of being deprogrammed, mind you), must decide whether to follow said Plan or risk it all with the girl.  What ensues is, more or less, one chase scene after another, ad nauseum.<br /><br />As we get deeper into the film, it's readily apparent even the Bureau members (all sporting hats, which allows them to pass in and out of the wormholes) aren't sure of their powers; accordingly THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU is confusing, convoluted, uneven, rambling, nonsensical, banal, and trite.  And those are its good points.  Even the extremely talented Terence Stamp makes an appearance as one of the Bureau's top hombres; naturally he lectures Damon's character as to why humans are no longer allowed free will:  because, when the Bureau has allowed free will, mankind gave itself the Dark Ages, world wars, near nuclear extinction, yada yada yada.  It was so superficial and hokey I didn't know whether to laugh or to cry.  So I did both.  Neither facilitated any relief from THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU.

This is a great free app of the day and personally I think it is worth the normal dollar asking price.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Graphics look good<br />-Solid frame rate<br />-Controls work well<br />-Lots of goals to acheive<br />-Stat tracking<br />-Tons of replay value<br /><br />CONS:<br />-Cannot opt out of OpenFeint<br />-No tilt controls<br />-Draw distance could be improved
B004SIP7AS|5.0|I have always enjoyed watching this movie on my VHS tape and thought it was time to replace the tape with a DVD.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its just ok. games are fun for awhile gets old fast. but it is fun. sure glad it was free.
B006ON41FC|4.0|this game rocks.  the main reason why i want to make this reveiw is for the people that complain about that stupid feint!!!!!!!! seriously,  SHUT UP!!!!!! just press the &quot; no thanks i don't like fun&quot; button!!!!!!! and your supposed to rate the game, NOT the feint.goodbye. thanx have a nice day
B004BSFC6Y|5.0|These went over very big at the baby shower. I can hardly wait for the baby to come to see them in action!!
B006ON41FC|5.0|This game is not only fun but refreshingly different. I don't know why people complain about the open fient thing it doesn't bother me at all. In fact I think its kinds cool yo compare my scores with others and try to best them. Yet another solid addition to my Kindle Fire I have to say! :)
B001K98MFU|5.0|Great movie but Im sorry Im not paying 150 bucks to own the blueray. I already own the DVD and will just suck up the \\"mistakes\\" that was made on that release version.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game feels so refreshingly different, that's my immediate reaction the first time I played Bag It. The  Puzzle mode particularly is challenging yet replayable. It was free but I would have paid for it any day! Another solid addition to my Kindle Fire.  ;)
B006ON41FC|5.0|To me this game is amazingly ADDITING. I would recommend this game to anyone that would want a game like Doodle Jump or somewhat like Angry Birds. You will fall in love with this game and you will instantly be addicted.
B006ON41FC|4.0|I like this app. u like it? i enjoyed playing it. I like this app. u like it? i enjoyed playing it.  I like this app. u like it? i enjoyed playing it.
B006PHD0RW|2.0|this game would be a 5 if it wasn't for the timer and if the creaters read this get rid of the timer and I will give it a 5
0385344228|4.0|I found the first few pages a bit dull and confusing but stick with it!!!!  This is one of those books that makes you wonder - how well do we really know our kids and family?  And how far would you go to protect them?  There are some wonderful ruminations on family life - especially how kids grow up and all of a sudden you can barely imagine that they were once little babies...how kids, teenagers especially, can really seem like total strangers and totally un-knowable...i really enjoyed the story once it gathered steam and speeds along to its eerie ending!
B006ON41FC|1.0|This game is Stupid!!! No Feint Junk!!! Just wanted a simple game. This game wants to access other information. Hate it.
B005OOL1IC|4.0|This was pretty fast on the shipping considering it was a week or so before Christmas and that was great! It was for my husband of course and he loved it! I still like the first one better! Very similar story line  to me.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Everyone rating this 1 star is absolutely ridiculous. I'll agree it's lame that they make you sign up for openfeint to play, but you know what? If you sign up for it, it will automatically sign you in every time. It's kind of like xbox live. You guys know what xbox live is, right? Good. Even if you don't care about achievements or leaderboards, big deal. It doesn't ruin the game in the slightest, unless you have some piece of crap phone you bought at walmart on their pay-as-you-go plan. In that case, stop being a broke bunghole and get on a real network. Also, to those that complain about the sound settings: there is usually a button on the side of your phone. You can press it either up or down. Did you find it? That's the volume button.
B006ON41FC|3.0|The game it's fun for a while, but the invisible walls at the edges are a real pain; just put the walls at the tree line... I also experienced a few temporary freezes, while flying<br /><br />Running Insert Coin ICS OC @ 1.5GHZ on HTC Sensation 4G (Pyramid) Root/S-off
B005K17RU0|4.0|Works as advertised. I haven't had any issues with it and use it on my Fire. I don't recall having a problem with it finding the city and applying it.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|While the game may work on some platforms, the fact that PopCap hasn't bothered to update the game to run on more modern devices and Android versions is telling. Clearly they are only interested in first-time sales and not supporting the products they peddle. This will be remembered when I think about buying another of their titles.
B000000HTM|5.0|When I was just starting my music collection I bought anything that had long tracks and anything that could potentially carry you to another place. I didn't necessarily care where the music was taking me. I just wanted to feel the power of be pulled into a musical phantasm. The greatest of those vinyls could do it repeatedly over the years. Most of them lost their power. This work still has the power to capture my imagination thirty or more years later. It was not easy to listen to for quite a number of turns on the table. At first I was sorry I bought it, but slowly it pull me in. There are only a handful of works of this quality and character in the history of rock. Yes, maybe a bit overdone and frenzied in small sections. Dissonance is never easy on the ear, and a lot of bands of that era built tracks into crescendos that were actually anti-climatic, ELP being the most guilty.  Todd Rundgren's A Wizard A True Star comes close in sonic complexity and can send you drifting away, but it is a light-hearted tromp, and too bad the other half of that album is just filler.  Well I guess I said a lot
B006GH6IS4|5.0|Wow! I love this blu-ray. I have loved Queen since I was in high school in the 80's. This documentary tells a great story of the greatest band ever. The quality is great and Roger and Brian are so funny but very sincere. I love all the stories of how they wrote the songs. Well done. I know for sure that if GOD sang his voice would be Freddie Mercury. Queen Forever.
0790729709|1.0|This is not a bad review of the movie itself.  The movie is great.  The Full Screen Edition on DVD (not same as Widescreen version) is HORRIBLE. The video transfer to DVD is appalling. The resolution appears to be done at VHS resolution, almost as though some lazy technician decided to just copy the VHS tape onto a DVD.  If you care about video quality, get the upcoming Blu Ray release or the Widescreen version of the DVD.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|I didn't catch it in theatres (sadly) but had heard enough things from people who know what kinds of movies I liked, that I went ahead and grabbed it on bluray. I love it. I've never seen Ryan Gosling in a movie before that I am aware of, I heard a bunch of people poo-pooing the movie because it had a \\"Chick Flick\\" actor in the lead, I heard a bunch of people complaining about it being slow, and others who were grossed out by the violence.<br /><br />I thought it was a great story, I liked all of the characters, I enjoyed the timing, the lack of pointless banter, the music and sounds were fantastic, and that when it was time for action it was deliberate and without nonsense. Pretty close to a perfect movie in my book. I'll watch it many times.
B00631VJIC|5.0|It's not all the music I would want but it does a good job. Would like to see some more offerings from Katey Sagal, not only is she a fox but she can sing!!!
0811879542|5.0|I love this book.  It is different, simple, and very creative. My 2 year old is not so sure- he gets bored half way through.  Maybe when he gets a little older he will like it more.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I really enjoy the plans I just wish it didn't have to have Internet to use it. I had to buy another Bible so I could read off line
B006PHD0RW|4.0|Definitely a fun game as all the other reviews claim.  I just wish the options menu had more control. Specifically, I want to be able to turn off the music while leaving the sound effects turned on.  Seems to me that this is a simply thing to do as literally thousands of other games have this option.
B006O5Y0SS|4.0|The movie would have been perfect if they'd have spent a little more time developing more likable characters for McAdams and her crew.  While it makes it easier to overlook Wilson's abandonment of her, I think Allen should have let the film be a little messier.  At least then you could believe they would be engaged in the first place.  That said, I loved the rest. Who doesn't love nostalgia??
B002BWP49M|3.0|Im not complaining about the movie im complaining how i special ordered it and i got it 3 days after it came out I could have just picked it up at the store that night.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love the game and so do all my friends. We love to get the golden nut . Buy game now!!!!!!!!
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|It gets sooo boring after the first few levels. its repetitive. and you have to be perfectly precise. I just don't understand why people love this game so much.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great app if you have a lot of time there are a lot of games that will keep the kids busy busy busy
B006PHD0RW|5.0|The object of the game is to place grocery items in the bag. Sounds simple enough but the game has different takes. In one part of the game, you have to make sure the items don't get crushed by the weight of other items (especially melons or stacks of egg cartons, etc). I was entertained enough with that version of the puzzle but as you unlock more stages you open more games. In the next round of puzzles, the point is to crush the items. Sometimes, you have to crush certain items and preserve others.<br /><br />You can tell that the designers of this app had a lot of fun with this and spent a lot of time on it. The items even have their own names likes \\"Eggward\\" (egg carton) and Crousteau (loaf of bread). I really enjoy the fact that they took a simple idea and expanded it to make a very addicting game with different spins.<br /><br />Picked it up when it was a free app of the day but I would gladly pay the full and rather inexpensive price.<br /><br />The only annoying part of the game which is a small peeve is that if you mute your phone and turn on the BagIt app, the media volume kicks in (at least for my phone) Oh well, it deters me from playing in class.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|It fits perfectly!  I love the Pink Color as it makes it easy to find.  I love how it closes with the strap accross the front.
0525422943|4.0|With multi-platinum records, a celebrity girlfriend, and fame galore, rocker Adam Wilde appears to have it all. But from the surface no one would know how close he is to unraveling. He is addicted to a myriad of substances and his relationship with the band is strained to the point that they don't even stay in the same hotels.  These pale in comparison to the root of the problem, the absence of Mia in his life. For all he can see, it seems as if Mia hasn't blinked in the three years they've been apart. Studying at Julliard while her concert-career takes off, she's probably too busy and too happy in her success to miss him. But when Adam and Mia are reunited in New York, they are forced to confront what staying has cost each of them, and where they've been. Maybe twenty-four hours is all they needed for closure from the past and hope for the future.  In all honesty I didn't rush out to read Where She Went after I finished If I Stay (my review). As fitting as the ending was to Mia's ordeal, I wasn't sure where her story could go that would satisfy ending on the note that it did, at the beginning of a path of grief and pain. But just knowing the sequel was out there with a possible happy ending for these characters was irresistible. Even if it wasn't the ending I envisioned I had to know anyway, especially in light of the glowing reviews and better-than-the-first declarations in the blogosphere. I'm very glad that I eventually picked it up - if I had known what I was missing, I would have regretted not doing so.  There is something to say about quick reads that have substance; but whether it was quick or slow, heavy or light, I could not put down Gayle Forman's Where She Went. The spare prose is even more sure of itself here, with the narration switching to Adam after such a dramatic turn of events. And with the exceptional characterization on display I could not be more captivated. Broken and messed up as he is, I may like Adam more than Mia in If I Stay if only for how his whole soul is laid out. Ms. Forman spares us nothing. In his unhappiness, Adam's behavior is ugly at times, from lashing out at reporters to chewing out his band mates and simply being a privileged jerk. Anyone can see that he just needs love and friendship, so you can't hate him for his actions. I loved him all the more for what he's gone through and how he's grown up. For all the information given for where Adam has been, we offered about the opposite for Mia. Yes, she's been beyond busy studying at Julliard, practicing, and traveling around the world performing, but where has she been emotionally? I would have appreciated some of the novel written from her perspective. As it is, it seemed out of character for her to drop Adam the way she does without further explanation. Nevertheless, it's hard to judge the girl after all she has lost. The ease of the solution seemed to fit the heartbreaking circumstances. After reading the ending I happily flipped back to reread those quiet, intimate moments at Mia's apartment that made my heart palpitate. Both If I Stay and Where She Went are beautifully written novels that will do just about anything that can be done to your heart. A worthy sequel, Where She Went is recommended for fans of contemporary YA.

0439813786|4.0|For a boy in 1931 Paris, Hugo Cabret leads an unusual life. Living alone in the train station, he gets by by keeping the clocks wound and stealing. Whether it's food or small mechanical parts, stealing has become second nature to him. Possessing those cogs and wheels means the world to Hugo, so when getting caught by the old man at the toy booth puts a damper on his collecting, Hugo sees it as the end of it. But then there's the girl - maybe she can help free him from his predicament. He couldn't foresee that she and the man would be much more than that as he searches for meaning and purpose in his solitary life.  I'm not sure why I held off on experiencing Brian Selznick's The Invention of Hugo Cabret until now. In retrospect it seems right up my alley with its unique and novel format.  I knew that it used both words and illustrations to tell its story, and with it winning the Caldecott Medal I expected to see elements of a picture book. The graphic novel similarities were also expected, as the book relies strictly on images to tell portions of the story in certain sections. What surprised me was how from the start it also felt like a film - a silent, black and white one at that - or even one with stop animation. Reading further the references to early film history made it clear how well the media suited the story. It is how Hugo bends and blurs the lines between these mediums which is my favorite aspect of the book. What I also loved (and made the format work) was how smooth and natural the transitions from words to pictures felt. Most often it was the illustrated action scenes which I found so refreshing and appropriate. After all sometimes a picture does speak a thousand words. Beyond my enjoyment of the format, I liked Hugo, who is flawed in his good intentions. Life may not turn out like he planned but what happened is better than he could ever have dreamed.  I enjoyed the simple, heartfelt story of how he becomes the Hugo he is today. A quick yet meaningful winter read, The Invention of Hugo Cabret was exactly what I needed this busy time of year. I will definitely be picking up Selznick's latest Wonderstruck, which I already have in my possession.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Look, I'm a big Van Halen fan so there was no doubt I was going to pick this up.  However, I am completely shocked by how good it is.  I pretty much expected a couple decent tracks, albeit with a beat DLR voice.  Boy was I wrong.  Every track is great.  DLR sounds great.  Eddie's tearing it up.  Must buy album.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This game is nothing but fun.  It wastes your time like nothing else.  I love the graphics and the quirky sounds that the squirrel makes.  Just have fun is what this game is all about. People are rating this like it is the next Angry Birds or something...could be who knows? But just play the game for yourself and you will see.<br /><br />My son is going to have so much fun with this.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|My daughters turned me on to Adele and must admit... prior... I did not really know her. Once you listen and experience the emotion...passion and voice... you are hooked.

B002BWP49M|2.0|I loved the books, and I really like the movies, but I can not believe the stuff that was missing from this release.  No deleted scenes, a handful of interviews with the actors that we have all already seen on various interviews already released.  Yes, I enjoyed the making of documentary, but felt very cheated that that was all!  I will really feel ripped off if they release a bunch of deleted scenes and stuff with a boxed set when all the movies are released to DVD.  I can understand holding some stuff back.....but none, come on!
B005EZJ3MW|1.0|I have been a Demi Lovato fan since the beginning, and to hear this album makes me cringe.  Half of the songs are shallow, sell-out songs, devoid of real meaning or purpose.  \\"You're My Only Shorty\\"  really, Demi?  The first time I looked at the track list I knew it would be terrible, but I have listened to the album several times through, just hoping there was something I missed.  The only good song on this album is \\"For The Love Of A Daughter.\\"  Honestly I am terribly disappointed.  As a musician myself, it really makes me angry that Demi sold her soul to the music industry, because they have robbed her from her talent.  What a waste of a beautiful voice :(

B004QZ9PLU|5.0|As expected from Nicholas Sparks The Best of Me is a well written book. The story deals with the split of society, and the usual socialites outlook on the less public crowd of people. This is a can't put it down book.

Unlike my husband and children, I am not a big music person but I have been wanting to get a CD by Adele and I am so glad I got the CD/DVD. Her voice is so beautiful and even with all her success she has had over the last year, she is a very down to earth person. Adele is a beautiful person inside and out. I love how she tells a story with so many of her songs and makes them even more personal then before. This has to be the best thing I have purchased in a long, long time and considering I love my purses, that is saying something, believe me.

0345440900|3.0|When I got home from the hospital I realized that all my efforts attention and actions were about having a healthy pregnancy and easy labor. I did not do much research or preparation to handling baby. I visited 2 hour class of infant care at the hospital with my partner while being pregnant and felt ok. But the reality was I did not know what to do with my daughter and I was getting upset as I had hundred questions about spitting out, her crying, feeding, etc. I went on line and ordered several best sellers for baby care ( including this one). It did not answer my questions but helped me in other way: I was not panicking that mucho when my daughter crid but tried to understand what can get her upset. I can't not say that I know in every case the reason of her crying but  very often can stop it guessing. EASY routine did not work out with my daughter though. II would recommend to read this book to a new parent, but also educate yourself reading otherntheories.

B0042U94UQ|5.0|I loved this movie and my 10 y.o. daughter loved it even more. It is so good, that I hardly know where to begin - so I tried to put the whole review in four points, mentioned in the title:<br /><br />1. Hilarity - IT IS HILARIOUS! REALLY! There is hardly any 15 seconds in this movie that would not contain a really good gag, children or/and adult oriented. Whoever wrote the scenario was a genius!<br /><br />2. Despicability - the main character, Gru, is really a delight to watch: ugly, grumpy, mean, petty, vengeful, scheming, permanently aggravated and wholeheartedly devoted to the cause of evil - and in the same time incredibly insecure, convinced deep in his heart that he is a looser and haunted by the every day stronger feeling of the impending doom, for him and his evil army. I believe also that even his name is a kind of evil double entendre: it is obviously an abbreviation of \\"gruesome\\" but GRU was also, during the Cold War, the name of Soviet Army military intelligence, in charge particularly of assassinations abroad. In some James Bond movies GRU appeared under the name of Smertch. It gives a particular flavor to Gru, considering that his character is clearly inspired by some of the supervillains from James Bond franchise. His geriatric sidekick (and only friend - well, kind of) doctor Nefario and his murderous dog/rat/wolverine/skunk like pet (even after two viewings of this movie the jury is still out in my house on the question \\"what is this animal?\\") give also a great show!<br /><br />3. Girl power - any parent of little girls (I have two) will fall immediately in love with Margo, Edith and Agnes, the three little orphaned sisters Gru adopts in the movie. He adopts them for his own evil reasons and does intend to treat them harshly and get rid of them as soon as they are no more needed - but of course ends by being completely taken under the sweet and soft but in the same time surprisingly totalitarian control little girls exercise over their fathers, adoptive or not...))) Agnes, the youngest of the three (she is barely out of the diapers) is particularly sweet - if only she was real I would adopt her on the spot and spoil her silly all the rest of my life. Tomboyish Edith (she is in principle the one who is the boldest - but she was already hurt enough in her life to hide behind her pink hat which she refuses to take off even to sleep) and precociously adult (at least on surface of things) Margo are also a delight to watch. If you already are a parent of a little girl, you WILL LOVE this movie. And if you do not have yet a young daughter, get one!<br /><br />4. But as far as the reasons to watch this movie go, even the girls must cede the first place to the minions! The incredibly devoted, fearless and highly professional and in the same time impossibly immature and conflicted \\"evil\\" army of Gru minions is THE greatest treasure of this movie. By looking at the cover of the DVD you can see some of them and frankly whoever conceived Gru minions was a world level genius. I do not want to provide spoilers, but believe me - they pack incredible fun! There is also at least one scene when their childlike devotion to their master almost made me cry - before another outburst of laughter (including a lot of giggling) in the cinema took over...<br /><br />I purposefully omitted in this review many characters and did not hint at most of the gags and scenes, to avoid spoilers and keep things short.<br /><br />To conclude, this is a TREASURE OF A MOVIE. A thing to buy, watch, keep and re-watch on regular basis. And I ABSOLUTELY HOPE FOR A SEQUEL!youngest of the three (she is barely out of the diapers) is particularly sweet - if only she was real I would adopt her on the spot and spoil her silly all the rest of my life.

B006ON41FC|4.0|I'm not that great at it, so I uninstalled it.....but I can see how it can be a time waster for some.  As for the &quot;open feint&quot;...just turn your wifi off on your device (play offline)!  Solves that problem.  You can still play it!
B006ON41FC|1.0|An app once linked my phone to open feint while I was visiting my family for Christmas.  Everyone died except me.
B006ON41FC|1.0|Get rid of open feint people don't like being forced to use it so why make them I will update my review if it is removed
B006PHD0RW|4.0|I work 8 hours a day as a cashier. When i saw this game as the aotd I could have fell over. I love it and all my co works thought it was too funny. Its challenging, the physics are a little loony, but you quickly get the hang of it. If it wasn't free i would have bought it!!!
1576754227|4.0|This book is filled with practical tips to stop procrastination.  There are many ideas I have read in other books, but this puts them all together in one concise book.  The image of eating the biggest, ugliest frog first thing in the morning will never leave my head!  Well worth the money spent.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|My daughter was thrilled to get this collection! She's been a long time fan, and it was nice to finally have the complete set of movies. I've heard rumors of more \\"deluxe\\" versions coming out, but this was fine, because in the end, its about enjoying the films!
B006PHD0RW|4.0|I didn't expect much when I downloaded this game but it has grown to be a faborite of mine. It starts out rather easy but introduces more elements as you profess and can get addictive as you try to outdo yourself. Instead rewarding the player with new levels of the same, I was pleasantly surprised that higher scores net you new gamplay challenges: crush instead of protect, or more puzzle oriented levels. Now, for my complaints (small as they are). The music is boring and repetetive and I generally choose to do without. Also, there's the Open Feint issue which they thankfully give you the ability to opt out of. Finally, the controls are occasionally unresponsive when one is trying to turn the produce to them fit in the bag. However, that last issue came up so rarely for me that I may not have mentioned it if I hadn't noticed similar complaints from other Kindle Fire users. All in all, I found it a very enjoyable title.
B006E4QCXU|3.0|Fun and interesting app that simulates how stars are effected by gravity. You can see the patterns you create in astronomy books. Even use two points for even more interesting patterns.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I am a puzzle game fanatic, and have beat cut the rope, router, and infection to perfection. It's always hard to find another good puzzle game after finishing one, and quell is definitely one of the best games I've played. The graphics are beautiful, game play is fluid (ha), and the puzzles get really challenging as the levels increase. At 99 cents, this game is a steal!
B0045EPCQ4|3.0|I love Eat Pray Love.  I find this book very draggy and not near as compelling as her last book.
B005NF2UE6|5.0|It's always been a love/hate thing 4 nickelback. Mostly because there first few album have been played out. Also  they have got annoyingly soft. But i have always liked there style of music. And how they put together there lyrics is off the chain. This things are sick on here and now. But alot harder. If you love straight up rock with a edge you'll love this one.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Fun app, very addicting. The goals are challenging but attainable. Makes you want to keep playing until you've gotten it done.
B005ZUR724|4.0|Great game.  I had a few issues getting it to update properly from the Appstore, but it seems fine now, though there are sometimes connection issues.  Overall a very fun MMO for a good price.  Got it on sale for $.99 but it is worth $6.99 with 3 free months definitely.  Very impressive for the Fire.  I don't like that they keep pushing in-app purchases in a paid app, but that is just me.
B006ON41FC|1.0|ughh why the auto login for open feint???? It's bad enough that the game freezes &amp; the controls are lagging (motorola razr maxx). this app is terrible the whole way around
B004JRVQX0|5.0|We are very please with the new iLok it works great with our new HP 23\\" TouchScreen computer and the new Protools 10
B0033AI48Y|5.0|This Blue Ray was a great deal and is such a wonderful movie. My husband has been remembering back to when we first saw it and he finally asked for me to get it for him. At this price who could refuse? Even if you don't like sub titles, this movie is wonderfully beautiful and a GREAT addition to any ones library. Especially if you like historical movies!
B006ON41FC|3.0|I don't see what the big deal is about openfeint. it doesn't bother me. I enjoy the game. since its free, its definitely worth downloading. its a nice game to play when you want to waste some time.
B001KPUQGM|5.0|Unbelievable!  While I was reading Shantaram, I actually kept bursting out in laughter.  My wife is reading it now and the she is laughing out loud too.  This book is literally one of my top ten and I've been reading all my life.  You could say I'm a bookworm.  I've never read a more realistic description of drug addiction.  Gregory David Roberts has a special way of reaching the heart.  His heroin addiction is minor part of the entire book yet he does it better than William Burroughs.  My daughter gave me a soft cover edition of this book and, upon reading it, I had to have a hard cover signed edition, book collector that I am, so I bought it from an Amazon vendor.  This massive book brings Bombay, now called Mumbai in India, to life.  So wonderful, I just can't praise it enough.<br />Gregory David Roberts, a career criminal because of his addiction, escapes an Australian prison after serving 10 years of a 19 year sentence and travels to Bombay.  And the odyssey begins.  A guide named Prabaker is one of the warmest human beings I've ever met in the pages of a book.  If you've read a book and never wanted it to end, then you know how I felt about Shantaram.  Wonderful, heartbreaking, exciting, uplifting!  I can't say enough about it.  So I'll stop right now!
B001DTPZNY|5.0|I HAD to have this movie, It's my favorite of all of them! Very pleased ! Came in very fast and the quality is perfect!  Thank you!
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I took a chance because the price was so low..Glad I did because it exceeds my expectations..Used with my amplifier and voice and music were clear and crisp..Used with my Harmonica, allowing me to play using both hands ..Output was more than adequate~in fact I had to lower mic output adjustment on amp so I did not overload and get squeal(set about midway and speaker volume was loud,clear and consistent, even tho amp is inexpensive.If the price was twice as much I would still be satisfied....NO!!.. I do not work for the company that sells it.
B006ON41FC|1.0|Game looked like fun, another game to share with my 4 yr old grandson on my Kindle Fire since I have other apps &amp; e-books for him. But I'm glad I read other reviews about not being able to opt out and that's why it gets 1 star and no download, which is a shame since I really think he would've liked it.
B005HSL626|5.0|I like this app and then I don't because its not that great. then I do like it at times.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|amazing I never get bored playing this game even if this game was out for money it would so be worth buying and there is more than one game
B0012GMXYM|5.0|With the massive creative and even critical success of [[ASIN:B0000A2I1B Caravanserai]] and[[ASIN:B0012GMV58 Welcome]] in the last couple years before this,Carlos Santana and his band weren't exactly gaining any huge commercial successes from any of these. Whenever they appeared on a TV show or in concert,it seemed they were always expected to play the bigger hit songs from their debut trio of albums. Those were as creative hits and albums as they'd ever done. But when they moved beyond that,more towards jazz and funk they really began to lose some of that attention. They were perceived as a psychedelic latin rock band. The reality is...there was a lot more happening. It had to do with the San Francisco culture they spawned from. With Tom Coster still onboard for this album and Miles Davis/Chick Corea alumni Airto and Flora Purim taking a bigger role this time out this album musically really clicked with everything they'd been coming at since they started their career. I think it probably went somewhat unnoticed to even some hardcore fans. And I happen to know some writers and critics kind of dismissed it as...forgettable. Well whatever it is,forgettable it isn't.<br /><br />  Even with albums in between this provides something of the musical link between the earlier [[ASIN:B0000A2I1B Caravanserai]] and the next album [[ASIN:B00171RQBW Amigos]]. Starting out with \\"Spring Manifestations\\" on a Brazillian fusion percussion roll call or sorts and ending in the same manner on the closing title song,with Airto's wordless vocal cries as an exit point we have instrumental numbers such as the late 60's Miles Davis type,quietly melodic \\"Conto De Los Flores\\" along with \\"Aspirations\\",the leslie amped \\"Flor De Canela\\" and \\"Promises Of A Fisherman\\". These are all melody based,filled with this almost...audio impression of bright sunshine directly overhead. Quiet but stinging hot all at the same time. Tom Coster's organ work is paramount on these songs. \\"Life Is Anew\\",\\"Give And Take\\",\\"One With The Sun\\",\\"Practice What You Preach\\",\\"Mirage\\" and \\"Here And Now\\" make up the main core of the albums. All are vocal numbers featuring the relatively newbie Christian funk vocalist Leon Patillo,who sings very meaningful and spiritually open lyrics along with some of the most flowing,slick and danceable melodic funk of the era. Each starting off in the somewhat more jazzy vein these numbers are truly Ricky Vincent's \\"united funk era\\" personified.<br /><br />  This newfound funk direction would be something admirers would hear the band continue to develop for the rest of the 70's decade. They would soon get their poppier side going stong again after this album. And this would wind up being the last of the Santana band's more abstract jazzier style excursions. But this one kind of one up's it's predecessor to a degree by rather anticipating a more pop oriented sound with it's thick but softly produced funk grooves. Nothing on this albums,even Carlos's passionate as always lead solos are particularly loud. In a lot of ways,aside from the sometimes penetrating sound of the guitar solos this isn't even a rock n' roll album in the traditional sense of the word. Not even psychedelic. The songs are deep inside the groove and there really isn't the same sense of ego tripping noise making usually at the core of rock music. Maybe it was some type of rock in a jazzier funk place,who knows. If so Santana was continuing to redefine what rock was. I heard it said recently rock music was at something of a low during 1974 in particular. Maybe because with albums like this it was starting to merely turn different colors that got some people a little confused. Either way this is an excellent album,great to get your head and ears straightened out with and revisiting if you never heard it.th The Sun\\",\\"Practice What You Preach\\",\\"Mirage\\" and \\"Here And Now\\" make up the main core of the albums.

B006UG90RM|3.0|I would definitely liken this release to a mix of good and bad. Some songs work, some don't. But, the biggest problem with this release is the production.  Specifically, Eddie's tone.  I was full well expecting Eddie to bring back some semblance of his original signature brown guitar tone.  Instead, this album completely went the other way.  The guitar tone is muddy, muddled and crunchy (in a bad way).  It doesn't even sound like the Van Hagar era tone either. The only way we know this is Eddie is through his guitar phrasing. Unfortuntely, the guitar was fed directly from his guitar processor right into the digital mixing board and then recorded. I should know, I've done this and it produces a tone that sounds just like this.<br /><br />Instead, with the return of DLR, I was fully hoping Eddie to air mic his Marshall amps once again and give us some sort of analog sounding tone. Instead, we get this.  And no, it is not a brown tone.<br /><br />Additionally, the songs don't really have the hooks that we would expect to hear in Van Halen songs, like Runnin' with the Devil or Jamie's Cryin.  It doesn't even fit the mold for today's pop or rock standards either.  This CD has more in common with a Jam session than an AOR rock CD.<br /><br />As for mastering, this CD just doesn't have the dynamics needed to make it stand out aurally. The mastering engineer just didn't do the final mastering correctly.  The drums are majorly buried (other than the snare) with Eddie's guitar practically in your face.  The mastering tone of the songs is very midrangey and flat.  The high ends are missing in the snares and the guitar.  Overall, this CD needs a lot of help to make it sonically better.<br /><br />Personally, I'd tear all the instrument tracks apart and redo the whole mastering job from the ground up.  I'd give the drums much more brilliance and depth.  I'd run Eddie's guitar through a cabinet emulator to at least sound like it came out of a Marshall.  I'd then put it all together and push the guitars back just a little so we can at least hear the drums and bass better.  Frankly, I might even move the dry guitar to the left side with the wet on the right (at least on some of the songs) in ode to the original VH mixes.  I might have even done that on the whole CD to give it much more in common with the original Van Halen sound.<br /><br />David Lee Roth's vocals are adequate, but not spectacular.  His voice is aging and he's a little out of practice with doing this, so you can hear it on some songs.  Although, I will say his vocals on this release are far better than I expected after hearing the last DLR band release. So, Diamond Dave at least has that much going for him on 'A Different Kind Of Truth'.<br /><br />Overall, the CD has its moments.  Eddie's playing is good throughout, but the guitar tone just grates on my last nerve and the guitars sit right in the mix at a space that practically buries everything other than David Lee Roth's vocals. Every time I listen, all I think about is that I want to remaster it.le so we can at least hear the drums and bass better.

B005HQ5S3G|5.0|The newest album from Kelly Clarkson might be one of her best.  The tracks are solid in its pop catchiness and the lyrics to each song speak to the overall theme -- Stronger.  It's easy to see why Clarkson is one of the most respected vocalists in the industry; she delivers each song with admirable vocal prowess and conviction.  The result leaves you both amazed by the range of her voice and her ability to utilize it effectively and a sense that you can relate to her because she is still that approachable.  Best tracks are: Stronger, Dark Side, The War Is Over, and Let Me Down.  It's easy to forget that Clarkson made her fame by using her incredible voice in light of all the recent concentration on her weight, sexuality, and politics.  I, for one, am here solely for her music and talent and this album does not disappoint.  Buy this album because you enjoy music and recognize vocal talent in an industry of autotune and smoke screens, not because you agree or disagree with her politics.
B0026IUXME|5.0|This week was the first week that I ever saw this movie. I was so moved I had to watch it twice. The story of Wladyslaw Szpilman is so moving and touching that it has gotten me both times. Do I recommend it? Yes, very much so. If you haven't seen it, go see it. Now. I purchased the Amazon copy so it's on my library, but I plan on buying a DVD copy of it and later a Blu-Ray (if I get around to buying a Blu-Ray player).  The story is of a famous Polish pianist named Szpilman who is a Jew in Warsaw during World War II with his mother, father, two sisters, and brother. Through his music, he is able to survive and escapes death many times (I'm not really ruining anything since he has to live as he would later become famous again). The composition for this movie is fantastic and I have since started listening to the great Chopin. Not to mention, if you love Adrien Brody, this is absolutely a must-see film. He is amazing in this film and about as gorgeous as ever. His performance as Szpilman will forever haunt me because it is so lifelike and will stay with you. Watching this movie made me realize how easy of life is. We can get food, water, or blankets when we need them, but he could not. He survived with what he could find, even after every little tragic thing that happened to him.  Overall, fantastic film. Five stars across the board, no hands down. If you see this movie in stores, buy it. You won't be disappointed. Who knows? Maybe it will inspire you to learn to play the piano. It might just save your life someday.  God Bless Wladyslaw Szpilman.
0812992792|1.0|Struggled. I don't like struggling through a book.  So convoluted. I would read and reread passages and still didn't know what was going on a lot if the time.  Was it fantasy, a flashback or really taking place.  What a chore. Glad it's over.
B004JC16LC|5.0|107 CDs dedicated to a conductor who died in 1954 may seem obsessive to some, but there are so many treasures in this magnificent set that a few deficiencies in sound quality are of little importance. Who would not want to hear the world premiere of Strauss's Four Last Songs with Kirsten Flagstad, however rough the sound may be? Many of the recordings are from live performances during the 1940s and 50s, and most of these sound very well for their age.<br />It may be supposed that a set of this magnitude includes every available recording by this great conductor, but this is far from being the case. Instead, the compilers have sought the best Furtwangler versions of each work, with excerpts from some of the alternative recordings. This is a reasonable compromise, but it does mean that the Furtwangler completist must seek out another 9 versions of Beethoven's Eroica Symphony and much more.<br />Highlights are too numerous to list in full, but the Mozart and Wagner operas rank highly, as do the Tchaikovsky and Beethoven Symphonies. Hearing the conductors own symphonies is of more than passing interest.<br />Blemishes that should have been noticed during the digital transfers include an abrupt change in sound level during the slow movement of Tchaikovsky's 5th symphony and the clipping of the first note of the 3rd movement of Mozart's Symphony no. 40 - a fault that is also to be found on the EMI and Naxos transfers, but not on the original 78 rpm or LP versions. One must suppose that EMI licensed their CD transfer to other companies.<br />A surprising inclusion is Strauss's Don Juan with the Venezuela Symphony Orchestra, recorded on 21st March 1954. The sound is poor when compared with another version apparently recorded on the previous day with the Caracas Symphony Orchestra.<br />But these minor niggles should not detract from a quite incredible bargain. Those like me, who like to track down different Furtwangler performances can still have fun, but most people will be more than happy with this.th this.

B000687M48|3.0|I enjoyed the live concert DVD, but was very disappointed in the behind the scenes bonus video -not because of any lack in DVD production quality, but because I discovered that I don't like any of the band members and their juvenile antics. Not only are their tattoos, piercings and hairstyles ugly to me,  but I was not amused by the hotel room trashings, the moonings to the camera, and the overall silliness and immaturity. Some of the giggling and laughing seemed forced, as if they were trying to insist that they are having great fun behind the scenes, drinking and yelling and crawling on the floor, or dressing up in gorilla costumes. Ick.  I really only bought this item because I LOVE \\"My Immortal.\\"
B004A8ZWVK|2.0|We get either another Tyler Perry movie about the angst of affluent black women, the \\"feeling good about feeling bad\\" melodrama, or this Lifetime Channel mendacity. Here we have a story about a white female who feels \\"guilty\\" about being part of a society that degrades blacks, and as atonement she decides that the black maid isn't so far beneath her station to converse with in normal human terms. Eventually this is a story of white empowerment over guilt, a moral victory over ignorance. But the black people are still black, and there is the consolation of knowing that if the social pressure gets too hot, you are still white, and you abandon your pretenses, and all will be well again. But the guilt of belonging to a racist society is gone, because despite the fact that you have the good fortune of living in a world of white \\"privilege,\\" within the confines of your mind you have satisfied yourself that you do not personally hate. But you've done nothing to change the wider culture that maintains your status, nor do you wish to.  The problem with this particular film is that guilt cannot be washed away simply on personal whim; the ugly truth remains. In the mid 1960s, James Baldwin wrote an essay about white \\"guilt\\" and history. \\"The guilt remains, more deeply rooted, more securely lodged, than the oldest of old trees; and it can be unutterably exhausting to deal with people who, with a really dazzling ingenuity, a tireless agility, are perpetually defending themselves against charges which one has not made. One does not have to make them. The record is there for all to read. It resounds all over the world. It might as well be written in the sky. One wishes that Americans, white Americans, would read, for their own sakes, this record, and stop defending themselves against it. Only then will they be enabled to change their lives. The fact that Americans, white Americans, have not yet been able to do this- to face their history, to change their lives-hideously menaces this country. Indeed, it menaces the entire world.\\" In other words, those who forget history are bound to repeat it. And deeds speak louder than words.  People will say that the world has changed, and to a certain extent it has. White America accepts blacks insofar as they can entertain them, like the gladiators of ancient Rome who were nevertheless tied to a subservient social strata. We even have a black president, who serves as a \\"beacon\\" for American tolerance--but nevertheless is a figure viewed with suspicion and fear by many, kept on a leash so that he will not change the culture of white privilege. That is one picture; another picture is that white women, like the protagonist in this film, have the lowest unemployment rates and the highest college enrollment, while black men have the highest unemployment rates (probably double the \\"official\\" rate), and there are more black men in jail than in college. We may \\"debate\\" the reasons for this, but there is no mistaking that it has come to be \\"accepted.\\" Heck, even Oprah accepts it, even rejoices in it; she still doesn't realize that white people still have their hands on all the levers (just look at her audience).  Anyone who thinks that this film (let alone the book)is representative the \\"progress\\" that we've made is deluding themselves. We've hardly moved from that place; the dogs and fire hoses are gone, but the mindset and what is set before our eyes remains. This is a story about how one person removed guilt by denying an ongoing history.
B006PHD0RW|3.0|I picked this up for the Fire for free the other day.  It is a lot of fun, but the game is made quite frustrating by the unresponsive touch screen on the Fire.  You will often pick up the wrong item and on fast time puzzles, this is very annoying.  Also, many times you will try to rotate items, but the game will not respond.

B000AJIF4E|1.0|There are many fine sounding headphones out there, and these, although expensive are ok.<br />There are several I have owned (and lost or broken) which have similar sonic qualities, despite what you may have read about these being \\"industry standard\\". Audio Technica and Sennheiser are examples.<br />There are none that I have ever owned (professional musician, producer here) that have ever had more hideously attached (or NOT) ear pads. One week in, one pad came detached while gently taking them out of their carry bag. I have not been able to reattach since. ANd I'm a pretty handy fella: keyboard player, knob twister, soldering guy etc. THE PADS ARE NOT ATTACHED IN ANY WAY EXCEPT FOR A THIN PLASTIC RIM WHICH SLIDES AROUND THE PLASTIC EARPIECE-AND WHEN THEY COME OFF, AS CLEARLY IS OFTEN THE CASE, DO NOT GO BACK ON.  Hideous design, maddeningly inappropriate for \\"industry\\" use. THerefore...useless to me.<br />Thanks for listening. Be warned.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game was awesome until the updates. I had to completely restart my progress. Other than.that this game was awesome

For goodness sake, she's a funny woman, writes funny things, interprets her life experiences in a funny way and tells them as she sees them. What more would anyone want? Do you really need to read books admitting to personal secrets or serious family issues to enjoy a memoir rather than enjoy what a person does best? Keep making us laugh Tina, because you are an expert! Thanks.
B000P0J09M|5.0|Interestingly, I rewatched Goodfellas, #94 on the AFI top 100, right after rewatching A Clockwork Orange, #46 on the AFI top 100. Both are about an enthusiasm for violence. Both tie music into what is going on with the plot. Watching them back to back, even accepting how \\"groundbreaking\\" A Clockwork Orange is with its alternate universe and its invented language, I still think Goodfellas should rank far higher than it. The acting, the plot, and the insight in Goodfellas is simply phenomenal.<br /><br />First, we start with the actors. In A Clockwork Orange there is Malcolm McDowell, and while he's good, I'm not sure one person alone can stand up to Robert De Niro, Lorraine Bracco, Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, and the many other fantastic actors that are everywhere you turn in Goodfellas. Every single person is simply amazing. Even the \\"bit parts\\" like Michael Imperioli's \\"Spider\\" character get you interested. You are watching the very best of the best.<br /><br />And what they are playing is a real life story. This isn't an invention or fantasy. This really happened. These characters, their intrigues, their lies and deceptions and lust for violence, all of this was real. The men joking around with the mistress while the wife went to the family functions, the assumption that violence could happen at any time, this was the life they lived in.<br /><br />The music here is simply phenomenal. It sets you into the timeframe, and you can literally watch as the years unroll. It's not just the music, it's the hair styles, the cars, the decor of the rooms, everything. You can feel yourself reliving the decades and the feelings that they brought.<br /><br />The characters evolve over time. They rebel and feel angst and come to accept and then embrace what is happening around them.<br /><br />It's interesting because there's the same lust for violence here as in A Clockwork Orange. The characters enjoy pummeling another person. When Lorraine's character is roughed up by a neighborhood slick-guy, and Ray goes in to teach him a lesson, Ray *wants* to beat him up and put him in his place. When Joe feels disrespected in the bar, he wants to beat the guy into a bloody pulp, and he does. The violence is a normal, natural part of life.<br /><br />The women, unfortunately, hold the same be-used-and-often role in this movie as well. Women are there to be wives, kicking out kids and attending functions, or as mistresses, proving sex. In both cases they are supposed to be good natured, appreciate their part, and not attempt to change anything. A woman who complains at all about the small portion of life she's allowed can be beaten or worse.<br /><br />Still, I do at least give Goodfellas credit for giving part of the story through Lorraine's eyes. We see how hard it was for her, as the wife, to know there was a mistress around, that she \\"lost\\" her husband for days a week into that woman's arms, and that there was nothing she could do about it. She couldn't divorce, she couldn't complain. She just had to take it. The only other women she could ever talk with were other mob wives in the exact same situation. All the advice she got was \\"at least he's not in jail\\".<br /><br />However, in terms of the Bechdel test, it fails. The women rarely talk with each other, and when they do, it's about their men.<br /><br />A powerful look into a very real segment of society - and as much as it glamorizes how nice it was at times to be in a mob environment, it also shows the darker underside of it. While it might be fun while it lasted, it didn't necessarily last long.<br /><br />A great, powerful, well acted film.

B004K583KA|5.0|The Bach Cantatas unquestionably constitute the greatest single achievement by a single composer within a single genre in the history of Western music (though Haydn's cycle of Quartets runs it a close second in my estimation).  If you love classical music, sacred music, and Bach, you must not deprive yourself of the incredible privilege of getting to know this massive achievement. Perhaps even more mind-boggling than the proportion of quality to quantity in this vast output is the realization that there are probably at least a hundred more Cantatas that have not come down to us!  If there is a heaven--and it's hard to remain agnostic after a close encounter with these works--then I can only hope that it will be the privilege of blessed Bachians to hear these unknown Cantatas (and anything else the great master might have cobbled together on the slopes of Eternity).<br /><br />Returning to the present age for the moment, one notes with some dismay that the consolations of great music do not come without a cost--yes, the cost of intellectual effort, but also financial outlay.  And it is on this point that H&auml;nssler-Verlag's reissue of Rilling's Cantata Cycle maintains a distinct advantage, whatever it musical merits or vices.  With the Secular Cantatas included, along with exhaustive scholarly notes, texts and translations downloadable (and printable) from the CD-Rom included, this is a bargain that no collector can or should resist at the current asking price.  Even if you own other other Bach Cantata recordings in abundance, don't pass this up.<br /><br />The reason is simply that this is the ONLY complete Bach Cantata cycle performed with modern instruments, ample mixed choirs (not a countertenor among them!, and soloists accomplished in traditional (one may even call it \\"operatic\\") vocal technique.  Admittedly, a series of this magnitude, directed by a single conductor, and recorded over a span of at least two decades, will sometimes fall below expectations.  But the standard of accomplishment Rilling has achieved here is consistently high.  Though some of the earlier recordings are lacking in rhythmic vitality and favor too much legato phrasing, Rilling's priorities changed perceptibly during the first decade of this project, so that the bulk of these renditions are stylistically aware without being pedantic, energetic without being rushed, expressive without being romanticized. Indeed, if one compares Rilling's \\"learning curve\\" to that of Harnoncourt and Leonhardt in *their* pioneering Bach Cantata series--factoring out, for the moment, differences in performance practice priorities--one notes a conspicuous decline in the latter's engagement with the music, whereas one observes the opposite trend in Rilling's cycle.  In other words, Harnoncourt/Leonhardt evidently began to lose interest in the project after it was well underway, whereas Rilling's engagement never faltered, but only became more intense over time.<br /><br />This is obviously not the place to go into a detailed analysis of Rilling's performances.  I have been familiar with them, and impressed by them, since the days of vinyl discs.  Certain works, particularly the more festive ones, have rarely been surpassed for heady exuberance. One of my fellow reviewers cites BWV 129 as a salient example, and I readily concur. The opening chorus of BWV 100 provides another example of Rilling's ability to convey rapturous joy, and one could also cite the sparkling display of musical fireworks throughout the incomplete, and rarely heard, wedding cantata BWV 195. Rilling also frequently finds the charm in Bach's writing, particularly in those arias with obbligato winds; the delightful bass aria from BWV 123 provides a good example: the \\"walking bass\\" really really swings, with something like a detectable \\"back-beat,\\" while the flute solo enchants the ear with its florid passagework. Finally, I would note that at least one cantata--the well-known BWV 78--receives a rendition that is as close to \\"definitve\\" as any recorded Bach Cantata I know.  The famous duet zips along with enormous brio, and elsewhere the drama and pathos of this multi-diminsional score are perfectly conveyed.<br /><br />There are, of course, also interpretive misfires. The monumental opening chorus of BWV 102 bogs down into something of a sodden slog, and the four great choral pillars around which BWV 21 is constructed are similarly earthbound.  Occasionally, one finds Rilling insensitive to the affect of text and music, as in his brisk, mechanical treatment of the ineffable chorale setting with which BWV 105 concludes. That movement should begin in anxiety, and proceed through rejoicing to inner quietude; in Rilling's account, it remains boisterous all the way through. I could cite further examples in this vein, but fortunately for prospective purchasers, they are not numerous.<br /><br />Overall, then, the ratio of successes to failures, both in terms of entire works, and in terms of movements within cantatas, is remarkably high.  Of course, that positive outcome has as much to do with the quality of the vocal soloists (Helen Watts Arleen Auger and Phillipe Huttenlocher outstanding among them), choral singing (nice balance, good diction, sometimes too prominent vibrato) and ensemble playing (not quite in the class of Richter's Munich Bach Orchestra,but expert), as with Rilling's intelligent and unfussy direction.<br /><br />What of the recorded sound? Some of the earlier recordings in the series suffer from a rather shallow \\"soundstage\\" which, together with some close spotlighting of instrumental and vocal soloists, can create a cramped or harsh effect. Elsewhere, I noticed a persistent artificial-sounding resonance that might prove distracting on repetition. However, sonic imperfections scarcely detract from Rilling's achievement--the first single conductor to have run the Bach Cantata marathon--and H&auml;nssler's unbelievably low price tag.  As with the other reviewers I can only entreat my readers to obtain this bargain box before it becomes history.tion that is as close to \\"definitve\\" as any recorded Bach Cantata I know.

The story telling is excellent, the questions raised by the book are thought provoking and the characters are really interesting. I found myself googling the wife of Lee Harvey Oswald just to learn a little more about the woman in the story. I didn't fact check or spend time scrutinizing the details, rather I just enjoyed the story. Great work by Stephen King and I hope he does more work like this in the future.

1400052181|4.0|This was a book club pick that I have to admit, I had some initial reservations about. The description sounded pretty interesting, but I was completely unprepared to have enjoyed it as much as I did! I am really happy that I read it - not only was it a fast non-fiction read, but I felt that I learned a lot from it. Many of the facts presented were ones that I had never encountered before and they were presented clearly, and without being dry or in any way dull. From tidbits about cell culture itself to unethical studies, this was a fascinating (but be prepared to be horrified and sad along the way) read. So, please, don't be deterred by the book's description - it truly is worth the many rave reviews that it has received and is not at all what I feared it to be.
6304498969|5.0|I am a Clapton Fan (as my username shows), and I've enjoyed his music for a very long time.  This acoustic video is a good collection of thoughtful songs, and includes the slower version of Layla.  Although many don't like this version, it does show that a song well written can be adapted to multiple styles of play.  There is no mistake when you hear Clapton play acoustically or electrically.  You know his fretwork from the opening riffs.

0061537969|1.0|I want to start by saying this is not a book I would pick on my own to read. It's nothing like anything I would read, I just read it because it was required for school. The book is very depressing and at some points I had to stop reading because I was getting too depressed. I understand that this book is about life told in the eyes of a dog and that some parts of life are very depressing, but the whole entire book was depressing. Not a single good thing happened in the entire book, and if it did I missed it because the book was so depressing. I would rather be punched in the face then have to endure this book ever again.

B000002G6J|5.0|There are different forms of Brazilian music, just as there are many colors in the American pop music palette. Few people like all approaches to a music genre.  But, just about anyone interested in Brazilian music can find something to enjoy in the work of Antonio Carlos Jobim.  This LP is a jazz-bossa nova classic, arranged by Claus Ogerman, who really knew how to evoke a breezy beauty when working with strings.  Mr. Ogerman also arranged the excellent Sinatra-Jobim album.  This is a somewhat understated but very rhythmic work that has an atmosphere reminiscent of a trip to St. Maarten or Antigua.  Somehow, you just feel like you're in the deep Carribean when listening to this album.  The musicianship is excellent: Jimmy Cleveland and Urbie Green on trombones and a group of fine violinists whose names you will know if you read album covers.  Recorded by the eminent engineer, Rudy Van Gelder, it's essential for anyone interested in Jobim's music. I recall that this LP received a fair amount of play on the local jazz station when it was released ca. 1967.  But, it's not straight jazz.  It's Jobim at his best.  To steal a phrase from an old TV commercial: Try it, you'll like it!

B000007177|5.0|Enjoying my first-ever listen to Disc Two of this set.  As another reviewer aptly noted about Tull and their fans:  We just can't understand why so much good (and arguably better) material gets left off albums - especially songs which, in this case, seem more \\"mainstream\\" and, from a commercial standpoint (IMHO) might have been met with more success than some of what ended up on the store shelves.  So glad this material has finally seen the light of day in Night Cap.  Having lost my rabid fan status after their follow-ups to their huge '80s comeback Crest of Knave, my only regret is not having bought this CD many years ago, as it would have surely reinvigorated my interest and admiration of \\"their\\" music.  Very happy to have this missed gem in my collection now, my only thought is better late than never!  PS - Its odd enough referring to a proper name (Jethro Tull) as \\"they\\", let alone knowing they really are actually a singular\\"he\\" -- only his name is Anderson, not Tull.  Now let's see, who's on first again?......

B006ISJQ1W|4.0|I did not see the film in the theatre, so this is my impression from viewing it for the first time.  This is clearly a very difficult book to make into a film.  Since the conflict and dialogue is mostly internal, the visual interpretation comes off as somewhat superfluous.  I was, however, amazed that so many of the scenes were exactly as I had envisioned them from the book.  Wonderful!  But the big themes don't really come through.  I don't think the story works properly at all without showing Kemp being slowly, and unwittingly, sucked into the culture of rum consumption, tying together newcomers and natives alike.  While this culture is a socially accepted norm, the differing motivations of the participants becomes unsettlingly apparent.  It's also important to show him coming to appreciate the natural, historical, and cultural beauty that he discovers in Puerto Rico.  Without it, you can't appreciate his revulsion towards the opportunists whose sole interest is to profit from the raping and plundering of paradise.  The whole story becomes rather pointless without these foundations.  The characters are cast and played to perfection, with the somewhat surprising exception of Johnny Depp's portrayal of Paul Kemp, who seems far too detached.  Without the internal narration that is the hallmark of Hunter S. Thompson, he just falls flat.  If you know the book, I think you'd enjoy the movie.  If you only see the move however, you might be left feeling empty.
0061969656|3.0|Uhtred of Bebbanburg just gets better with age.<br /><br />That said, there were some problems with this book that I did not notice in its predecessors. First, the relative peace of the setting was boring. Maybe this space could have been used better to develop Uhtred's character and personal life? His enemies also lacked characterization. I had a hard time keeping track of them, or, for that matter, caring about why they should be his enemies. I missed the style of the larger-than-life characters from his other books - the Ragnars, Brida, the old guy with his mother's rib in his hair - these new ones all seemed to come from the same mold. Even Finan was little more than a name.<br /><br />On the other hand, the book had a transitional feel to it, and I expect the series to take off again with the next story. There were also enough twists and betrayals and battles and \\"Uhtred-isms\\" to satisfy this fan of the series. The ending was very exciting as well. I can't wait for more!

B0050DIWFC|5.0|This taut, muscular, beautifully written drama of crime and punishment is a 21st century tale of DNA, social media, forensic science, courtroom gamesmanship, passion, pain, and suffering.  It peels back the layers of the criminal justice system; it delves into family relationships; it probes what it means to be a parent and to love and nurture a child; it explores the ways in which young people today interact with each other and react to their environment. This novel will make you think hard about justice and injustice; about science and pseudo-science; about emotion and reason; about truth and lies; about who we really are and what really makes us tick.  It will leave you with haunting questions.  It will make you think, wonder, and marvel about the complexiety of human nature.  This is a stunning, masterful work that will propel you from page to page and leave you exhausted.  It is well worth reading.

B0014CQNTK|5.0|\\"Juno\\" is a movie about a pregnant teenager, a situation that is becoming more and more prolific in American society. It shouldn't be taken lightly and I don't really think that it is in this movie. Many people claim that \\"Juno\\" belittles the issue, but I disagree. \\"Juno\\" is a witty movie filled with humorous, if irreverent, cracks about a personal situation. It shows the main character deciding not to abort her child and choosing a much better approach of adoption. If anything, this movie illustrates a choice that not many teenagers make, and more should. The quickness to abort a child should be replaced with at least the consideration of giving the baby to someone who would love and care for it. The movie does not advocate teenage pregnancy in any way and shows the social shunning that Juno MacGuff encounters as a result of her pregnancy.  From the point of view of a teenager, this is enough to dissuade many. She is completely ignored by people she would consider friends and is the subject of ridicule. This hits home for any teenager that cares about fitting in. This movie personifies every teenager's struggle to remain cool and be someone that others like. It is incredibly realistic and the banter in the movie is enough to keep anyone with a quirky sense of humor in stitches. \\"Juno\\" does not aim to belittle the problem of teenage pregnancy, its intention is to use Juno as a relate-able character that finds humor in a tough situation.
B0071T5PN0|4.0|28 years have passed since Van Halen last released an album with David Lee Roth on the microphone - the 10 million selling juggernaut 1984.  In the decade following Roth's departure, Van Halen released 4 highly successful albums with Sammy Hagar earning a legion of new fans who embraced the band's more polished song writing and pop sensibility, but alienating those who felt the band had abandoned its southern California hard rock roots.  Throw in the departure of original bassist Michael Anthony (a gifted vocalist with a keen ear for harmony) and you have a band competing fiercely with its past.  Perhaps that's why the band intentionally decided to embrace its history and dig through its archives for inspiration.  Roughly half the album is reworked demos from the band's earliest days, many of which appeared on a Gene Simmons financed demo in 1976.  In many ways the album is a gift to the long-time, die hard fans who stuck it out through all of the band acrimony over a decade of false starts - a brief stint with Extreme's Gary Cherone, 2 failed attempts to reunite with Roth and a half-hearted tour with Sammy Hagar in 2004 that put Eddie's battle with alcohol in full view.  The song \\"Blood and Fire\\" is a nod to the band's rocky past and a salute to the fans - \\"look at all the people here tonight\\" Roth croons in a gesture that is certain to illicit roars from a live audience.  It is the album's most realized track, featuring a catchy melody from Roth and a solo from Eddie that is as accomplished and thrilling as anything in the band's catalog. \\"Blood and Fire\\" and the rather underwhelming first single, \\"Tattoo,\\" prove to be the album's only nods to Van Halen's softer side.  It only takes one spin of A Different Kind of Truth to realize that the band aims to remind you that they were once America's greatest rock band.  Overall, this is a collection of tracks that has much more in common with Fair Warning than it does 1984. \\"As Is,\\"  \\"China Town,\\"  \\"Bullethead,\\" \\" Honeybabysweetie Doll\\" and \\"Outta Space\\" are as heavy as anything the band has ever recorded.  These tunes are sure to please fans of very hard rock and wouldn't be out of place should the band ever play the Sonisphere Festival.  They rock and rock hard. The tempos are furiously fast, putting Alex Van Halen's impressive chops to full use for the first time since \\"Hot for Teacher.\\" Wolfgang Van Halen not only holds his own, he shines.  That said, fans of the melodic pop hooks of both the Roth and Hagar eras (e.g., \\"Jump,\\" \\" Why Can't this Be Love,\\" \\"Dreams,\\" \\" Dance the Night Away\\") are going to be, understandably, scratching their heads during parts of the album.  The heavier material in particular is long on ambition but short on melody and song craft.  Roth has always been more showman than singer, more wordsmith than master of melody.  He talks his way through a little too much of the record for most tastes, often choosing to force lyrics into small spaces when brevity and simplicity might have served the song better.  That's not to say that the album is without hooks.  \\"She's the Woman,\\" \\" Big River,\\" \\" You and Your Blues,\\" \\"The Trouble with Never\\" and \\"Beats Workin'\\" all feature the type of  memorable blues rock grooves and soaring harmonies that make so much of the Van Halen catalog winning.  \\"Stay Frosty\\" is a rollicking ZZ Top-style boogie that harkens back to the acoustic blues to rock explosions Ice Cream Man, Take Your Whiskey Home and The Full Bug.  Anthony's vocals are missed, but Wolfgang, Eddie(and perhaps some help from modern studio technology) at the very least approximate the band's signature harmonies.  If this were Van Halen's first album instead of the 7th, Eddie Van Halen's singular combination of blues feel and innovative guitar acrobatics would still launch a thousand imitators.  It really sounds that fresh.  And what Roth lacks in vocal chops, he more than makes up for with intent, youthful exuberance and a healthy sense of irony.  A Different Kind of Truth is a solid effort that is worthy of the band's legacy and a just reward to its loyal (and very patient) fan base.

Historical references are very brief and general, disappointingly so in some cases: I really would have liked to know more about alchemical imagery and its meanings, for instance. About all that most of the references seem to do is make the point--over and over--that Matthew, the handsome vampire, has been around a very long time and has been involved in important events throughout that time (though what he did in them is not clear), a sort of supernatural Forrest Gump.  The problem, in fact, proved to be not too much history, but too much romance. Most of the book is spent establishing, over and over and OVER AND OVER, that the main characters, reluctant witch Diana and handsome vampire Matthew, are deeply attracted to each other. (The only small mercy is that at least they are not teenagers!) I didn't share the attraction. Although these characters did grow on me after a while, I didn't find either of them that interesting, especially Matthew. In a world surfeited with handsome vampires, the author is going to have to do better than this; if she wants to meet a sexy vampire, I recommend that she look up Jean-Claude in the early Anita Blake (Laurell Hamilton) books, for one.  The writing isn't bad; it did keep me going through all those pages. I liked some of the secondary characters, too, including Matthew's mother, Ysabeau, and Diana's Aunt Sarah and her partner, Em (and their sentient, opinionated house!). They don't do much until the second half of the book, though. The book does pick up its pace in these later stages... only to end just as something interesting is finally getting ready to happen. At that point it seemed like the entire six hundred pages had been nothing more than a much-too-long prelude to whatever the author plans for a sequel, which left me feeling cheated and highly irritated. There's nothing wrong with sequels, but each book should also be able to stand on its own, and this one ultimately does not.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie shares a moving and essential message regarding (specifically) the role of fathers in a family unit but also deals with situations where the father is not present. So many things that we take for granted that are of the utmost importance in our lives but when we get caught up in the daily busyness of living we need to be reminded. I highly recommend it to everyone, no matter your current family or relationship status!

B006ON41FC|1.0|Update: 4-21-2015<br />This game has been updated and two major things have occurred.  First of all OpenFeint has been removed.  In addition IAPs have been added and the app now includes Amazon InApp Billing and Google InApp Billing.  There is now a large Shop button on the main screen and you can now buy nuts which are the fake money in the game.  You can spend $.99 up to $19.99.  You use the nuts to buy gear and outfits.  The app does play with the airplane mode turned on so your children cannot purchase IAPs.  You can also use the parental controls to turn off IAP access.<br /><br />Because of the addition of the IAPs into the app I lower my rating to 1 star.  This change is despicable and this is why you have to check updates of games.<br /><br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br /><br />I like this game! Gliding through the forest you have a real challenge but the controls to fly work well. Missing trees, evil owls, bad acorns, exploding balloons, winter trees, and burned out trees are just a few items in your way.<br /><br />I like how you collect acorns and can use them to buy a crash helmet or a magnet to attract the acorns. What makes this game fun is that it is a fresh idea and it is well designed and fun to play. This is something different in concept to many of the other games we have gotten and it plays well on the Kindle Fire.<br /><br />I like how you can collect achievements as a reward for good flying and meeting the games objectives. This is one of the most fun games we have gotten in a while. Thanks Amazon and End Games Entertainment!<br /><br />++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br /><br />I just got back and logged onto Amazon and was shocked by all the comments about OpenFeint. While the game did log onto OpenFeint automatically, I saw it log the score in the first time I played it, you can turn it off. I do wish developers would not include OpenFeint but they should at least default it to being off when you install the app.<br /><br />OpenFeint is not an issue on this game as it can be disabled. By clicking on the OpenFeint icon and touch settings, touch remove account, touch remove account again click OK. If it asks you to join just click &#34;No, I don't want to have fun.&#34;<br /><br />Oddly enough if you just retouch the OpenFeint logo you will sign back in and will have to remove the account again.be disabled.

1595827684|5.0|I know 2012 is just starting and there's still lots to be published but absolutely everything in this book is stellar. The art, the way it was spread, the quality of the paper and so forth. The book  is 80% character design (every stage from sketch to final 3D, lots of focus on the main and secondary character's heads) and 20% environment paintings and layout (and its a wonderful 20%).  That said, it is a crappy move not to credit your senior and lead artists at the very least. They bothered to put dinky IGN and Gamepro text reviews of the book on its back cover but couldn't afford 1 page in the book to cover the art staff. Shows how much they appreciate their staff.
B005UBNKWO|5.0|I have bought this processor along with a 990fx motherboard chipset, I havn`t overclocked it yet but as a first impression its HUGE, its really big comparing to my old pentium, the strongest point here is the price, its really cheap for a 6 core processor not to mention its unlocked and very overclock friendly, I havn`t played much of games yet but its really fast for multitasking and running cpu intensive programs, thanks to the big cache memory and turbo technology, alot professional reviewers view the fx series of processor as very bad or disappointing, forgeting to focus on the total price and value per speed, even the motherboards are much cheaper than intel and the 990fx chipset is the only chipset that support 2 x16 graphic card at the same time. you might wanna check passmark.com for benchmarking and value per performance.<br />overall its good so far and no issues.<br /><br />edit: most of benchmarks and reviewers are saying the bulldozer series is a failure, and its very slow, the fact is the series is not slow, and on 1080p gaming in comparison its only behind by 6-8 fps from the i5 and the i7 2500k, comparing this to the total price for a motherboard, rams and graphic cards, I would rather waste the money difference on another high end graphic card and run it in crossfire.<br /><br />the point am trying to make is that a merly of less than 10fps in games is not considered a failure giving the performance/value ratio, its a very solid buy.<br /><br />picking up and intel based 2011 79x chipset system and you will end up paying 300 - 400$ more in total, for about 10fps faster in games, thats not really a bargain giving that the 990fx and am3+ is newer and still has a lot of upgradeablity  potential which means it will last you longer since the upcoming piledrive are also am3+ based.<br /><br />please note that this opinion is based from a budget system build point of view, if your serious about building the fastest and strongest gaming reg then simply go with intel 2011 socket and an i7 3930x processor. that will cost you around 2000$ in total compared to amax of 800$ for an amd am3+ build.ith intel 2011 socket and an i7 3930x processor. that will cost you around 2000$ in total compared to amax of 800$ for an amd am3+ build.
B006ON41FC|1.0|Open Feint is an app killer. At least some games give us an opt out. Mobile games are for passing the time; I have no need to brash about a high score I got while waiting at the DMV. Full PC games are the only place I might do that.

0545425115|5.0|This was an amazing book. The author has taken a story of despair and turned it into both a love story, but also a story for survival. There is so much action in this book I found myself reading this non-stop form start to finish and after I ready this I found that I was so excited to read the next book too. While the concept of the book is deplorable in my eyes, I mean sending children to fight to the death is something that I cannot fathom in any society, but saying that though, the author makes it work. She does this through developing characters that you want to root for and characters that you want to hate. Suzanne Collins does a masterful job at developing a world that you can see yourself in and places you in situations where you feel that you are there with Katniss. This is a book that I would recommend to all!

0385335997|5.0|I have absolutely devoured Diana Gabaldon's \\"Outlander\\" series. I have seriously had to make myself read other things after becoming obsessed with these books as of late! \\"Voyager\\" definitely measures up the first two books in the series. I really enjoyed seeing a more mature Jamie and Claire in this one. I also liked that DG mixes up the settings quite a bit in this book. Scotland 1968, Scotland 1760s, the high seas (!), the Caribbean... all were fantastic! I can't wait to see what happens to my beloved Jamie and Claire in the colonies.
B006ON41FC|1.0|Too bad it has auto openfeint and you can not opt out of it. Why not give us the option like other apps?
B0037KMHRY|5.0|Awesome s/t!  There is something beyond sci fi geekdom about this one, it is genuinely sublime. Tres artful with flowing melodicism and nimble mutations; the integration of orchestral themes with ambient electronica is seemless. I come back to it again and again and am transported...
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I was looking forward to wrapping up the Hunger Games Trilogy, and just wondered how Collins was going to end her incredible series.<br /><br />The first 75% of the books was action-packed. A little gory, as usual, and just fast paced. I was really happy with how this book just took off from the beginning and wouldn't let go. Catching Fire, on the other hand, started slow and got better as it went along.<br /><br />Mockingjay started out fantastic, and ended with a ho-hum from me. I think the weakness of First Person Point of View is highlighted in the last 25% of this book. Without giving away too much, think about this - if your narrator is \\"out of commission\\" for whatever reason (knocked out, asleep, etc.), then your story pretty much is limited only to that character's waking moments.<br /><br />Apparently, a whole lot happened that the reader never gets to experience. With First Person, the writer is unable to weave subplots together, and secondary characters might get left behind or underdeveloped. Collins did an excellent job with these two innate weaknesses in the POV she chose to write in, but that final quarter of Mockingjay suffers terribly from being limited to only Katniss' perspective.<br /><br />Just a whole lot of telling instead of showing, which spells BORING. Some might hate the book because of the actual ending - but I think it's quite clever. The best way to end a book and make sure your fans are emotionally exploding at the end of your series is to give them a not-so-liked ending. So I don't have an issue with that at all.
B000000WCV|4.0|This is a confounding work, but I dig it. The first time you put on this disc, you will probably say \\"WTF!?\\"  But stick with it, there is some hella cool stuff on there. Totally uncompromising. Daft Punk clearly were out of the gate taking big risks with a \\"honey badger don't care\\" attitude. They go for it here using a DIY lo fi electronic vibe and are mostly effective. In the process, they create slabs of innovative funkyass music that sends the rest of us back to do more homework.

B000FC1LOC|5.0|My Sister's Keeper is an amazing book.  Katie and Anne are two sisters, Katie is the oldest sister who was diagnosed with lukemia.  Sara and Brian are the parents who will go to any lengths to save Katie, including in-vitro fertilization (which is how Anne is born) so that Anne can be a donor for Katie.  The twist comes when Anne sues her parents for rights to her own body so that she will no longer have to be a donor for her sister.  This story is not only thought provoking but it takes you on a journey that no parent ever wants to travel.  Throughout this journey you get to see how a family grows appart, how they also stick together, how pain can make you reckless... most of all this book makes you think:  Is it okay to bring a child into this world simply to save another?  How far is it okay to go to save a life?  Each character is well rounded from Campbell the lawyer whom Anne hires to take her side, to the judge, to the parents... each one of them is crucial.  There is some content in this book that I could have done without however, like the swear words and some of the sexualy explicit content, but aside from that this is one book I will not soon forget.

0307477479|3.0|Jennifer Egan is a talented writer who won a Pulitzer Prize for this novel, which is a collection of linked short stories with the stories set back in the '80s all the way into the future, with characters popping in and out. This seems to be a variation on what David Mitchell has done in novels such as Cloud Atlas. While some of the individual stories are wonderful, as the book moves on, the form overtakes what substance there is, leaving a book with that is observant on a micro level, yet is underwhelming as a thematic whole. Moreover, some of the later chapters come off as gimmicky rather than clever or innovative, which dulls the overall effect. People who enjoyed this book should check out the aforementioned Cloud Atlas, Alasdair Gray's Lanark and Edward P. Jones' The Known World to read writers who use similar techniques to what Egan utilized here, but with more depth and resonance.
B0058A119G|2.0|I have loved Barbra for most of my adult life, my gosh \\"Stoney End\\" in 1970 all the way till 2nd Broadway Album...Love love love..However this past 10 years while I still get exicted about news of a NEW collection of songs by her I am disapointed time and time again. The songs are so slow and sadly boring! I think Barbra thinks she is too old to sing songs by new song writers and try to at least stay in the game. I can see I am not the only one who feels this way, and I only write this review because I want to Love another collection by Barbra!

I even looked forward to traffic standing still so that I could listen to the story even longer. (I've got a 40 minute drive each way daily.) The whole \\"time travel\\" and \\"butterfly effect\\" really made me think. I can't believe that I listened to 30 hours... it sure didn't seem like it.

B006OAB3ME|3.0|Paul McCartney's new CD has 12 covers and 2 originals.  It's a very quiet set.  I fell asleep the first time I put it on, but not until the final cut which is his own \\"Only Our Hearts,\\" which is not the strongest song in the McCartney catalogue.  Diana Krall guests on a number of tracks with keyboards.  \\"My Valentine\\" is a sweet McCartney original with Eric Clapton on acoustic guitar and a lush string arrangement.  \\"Get Yourself Another Fool\\" is my favorite with Clapton's guitar giving a blues flavor and Krall's piano full of sass.  \\"It's Only a Paper Moon\\" and \\"The Inch Worm\\" are also quite sweet.  I appreciate McCartney wanting to pay tribute to music from when he was raised.  But this is a very sleepy set, desperately needing more pep.  Enjoy!

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very good for a long day in this very stressful life we live. I all ways enjoy the good book and the fact that these folks have made this app I couldn't be happier
B00729GQ0A|4.0|I have to say that once I got started, I didn't want to put it down! I just became lost in Rebecca Hamilton's world of \\"The Forever Girl\\".  Sophia is a wonderful character who starts out as such an unsure, guilt-ridden young woman & through her experiences we see her blossom & open up to her own strenths & powers as she learns to accept herself for who she truly is. Life lesson we could all take from.  I just adore the fact that this story involves Wicca & the natural elements as the basis of legends for the storys foundation...VERY ORIGINAL...  I can't wait for the next book in this series, thank you Rebecca :-)
B005Q1W10A|5.0|The most excellent second season of \\"Downton Abbey\\" finds the Crawley family and its many servants caught up in the First World War.  The young men of the Abbey, including heir Matthew and servants Thomas and William, are in uniform and off to the Western Front.  Downton Abbey becomes a convalescent hospital; the Downton ladies pitch in as nurses and administrators.  Head butler Mr. Carson and housekeeper Mrs. Hughes will struggle to keep up standards in the chaos of a changing household.<br /><br />The war changes everything, including the rules by which young ladies are expected to live.  The Crawley daughters will find wartime romance, as will some of the ladies below stairs.  The Dowager Countess will stand firm against the tides of change, with humorously unpredictable consequences.  Grantham heir Matthew and first daughter Mary will struggle with relationships complicated by the war, while the Abbey will know its share of tragedy.  A series of unexpected events will lead to a dramatic season-ending Christmas party in 1919.<br /><br />This Masterpiece Classic DVD edition includes seven episodes plus the two-hour Christmas special that ends the season.  Don't miss the fun of an absolutely terrific period drama; very highly recommended.
B006ON41FC|5.0|lots of fun! I I I I cant stop playing this game.  its very addicting. it really feels like you're flying. I play it on a kindle fire
B0063IH60K|4.0|kindle fire; works great. Has no issues I am aware of. I like the ease of the program. It has options to play winning hand or random deal.
B006GRBK4G|4.0|This was a visually stimulating dvd that delivered in many aspects.  However, if you're not a huge \\"Vale\\" fan, it may be a bit disappointing, if not irritating.  I must say, for full disclosure, I'm a huge fan of the \\"G.O.A.T\\", Valentino Rossi!  I highly recommend this dvd to anyone who is a true fan of the greatest sport in the world, motorcycle road racing!
B006ON41FC|1.0|I really enjoy this game. This is a distance game where you must fly as far as you can while collecting nuts and achieving goals along the way. The music goes quite well with the speed of the game, being of the country/rock variety, and the sounds are adequate. The graphics are really nicely done, with bright colors all around and good color choices on different objects and obstacles. The game never gets frustratingly difficult, and I played for hours before my phone needed a recharge.  The game does have some flaws that impact my score for it, and they're mostly due to the interface. For starters, there are no tilt controls. In this type of game, tilt controls would benefit steering the squirrel greatly. Instead, you're stuck using the left and right sides of the screen for input. Since you can select power ups while flying, tilt control would freed up your fingers to use them instead of having to choose between flying left or using a crash helmet. You can't set anything up from a main options screen; everything is scattered. For example, you can't turn off the sounds or music from anywhere but in the flying part of the game, and you can't opt out of Open Feint till after it logs you in and starts collecting data. I really don't like OF, but at least other games ask if you want to use it instead of just using it without asking. Even checking achievements loads OF. Why couldn't this just be done in-game? Lastly, the power ups seem sparse. The squirrel has a very bad turn speed, so I was hoping there would at least be an outfit or gear that increased agility or speed, but all the outfits appear to be only cosmetic, and the gear focuses on nut collection, distance boosting, and collision with obstacles.  Again, I really enjoy this game. I haven't had any freeze-ups or crashes in it like many other games do, and the game is really fun to play. The stars off from 5 are -1 for poorly-designed interface, and -1 for no up-front opt out of Open Feint. It's really a shame there are so many simple-to-fix problems with the interface that could have made this a 5-star game in my book.  UPDATE: On my third time playing the game I was once again logged into Open Feint involuntarily. This was the third time I've had to delete the OF account because the game started it without my input other than launching the game. The game also asked me to rate it twice in one game. Because of the Open Feint problem and the constant rating nag screens I've deemed this game unfit to remain on my phone. Unless the developers start hearing the cries of their customers and remove the nag screens and Open Feint problem this game will not get anything past 1 star from me (down from 3 before the update to this review).
B006ON41FC|4.0|it is awesome and very addictive! ! I over the game, but the squirrel moves slowly. but I love this game!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|not always easy but always fun. great choice for when you are bored. a lot of fun to play any time!

B006ON41FC|5.0|At first, I wasn't sure that I enjored the game.  However, I am now addicted ti getting nuts.  It's a bit crazy!
B006ON41FC|5.0|its fun, its cool, it includes consintraion, you try to never give up! and its really... did I say fun? also it feels just like your a flying squirrel!
B0052VUNHC|1.0|I purchased this after receiving an amazon email suggesting it, and because of the great reviews. After reading it, i think i must be too old to understand any of the good reviews. I found this book profoundly disturbing, and just wanted to take Abby and Travis to see Dr Phil! Separately, ha!
0061766089|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading Change by Design.  The fact that the book doesn't need to be read cover to cover is a bonus feature - feel free to skip around and read at will.  In fact, I enjoyed this book so much I purchased 25 copies and gave them as gifts to my students.  Design thinking is a skill that creative people should have in their tool boxes.  As an engineer, I found the approaches to free me from classic constraints, and the emphasis on visual thinking and sharing was an inspiration.  Well done!
B006ON41FC|4.0|wonderfully game so much fun cant stop playing it its the best. I. have to say I locve the game it has guest and store and other fun things
0393338827|5.0|Lewis is a great author. At the end of the day, financial books are simply not that enticing. There are only a few authors out there who can keep the reader engaged and wanting more. Lewis does this. He explains the 08 crisis very well and does so in an interesting manner which left me fascinated about the whole thing.  Well done.
B006ON41FC|5.0|good fun amazing addictive my fav game on my fire get buy worth 1 dollar very good ha ha ha
B0068VZQCC|5.0|`Memories of a Time to Come' is an excellent collection of some of the best from Blind Guardian.  It concentrates on mostly the middle albums from the band (Tales, Somewhere, Imagination, and Nightfall), while also having select pickings from the early albums (Battalions and Follow) and quite a few from the most recent album (Edge of Time).  If I had one complaint, it would be that the 'Opera' and 'Twist' albums are neglected with only 1 track from each, I had expected at least 'Fly' and 'Battlefield' would make the cut.  Though with 16 tracks (and also a disc of demos and early works) and quite a few other great songs missing I guess I can say: Oh well, always next time.  As for the remixes/reworkings/re-recordings, a few of them are noticeable, others not so much.  Majesty, both Bard Songs, And Then There Was Silence, and Valhalla are quite noticeable. Yes, even if you have the original albums you may want to consider this for these tracks, if you enjoyed them.  The Demos are exactly what they say they are: some work, some don't.  The Lucifer Heritage tracks are interesting... not to necessarily good, but it cool to see where the band started.  So I leave it up to you whether to go for the 3 disc or just the 2.  Now I bought this from Europe and had it shipped to North America.  It's packaged the same way the Deluxe version of 'At the Edge of Time\\" was, a mixture of paper and plastic. And in case you fear: Yes, the liner notes are in English (a German product for [mainly] Germans in English, weird I know).  The notes give some of the opinions of the band on the songs selected for the main album.  In conclusion: a GREAT Product from a GREAT BAND.  4.5 to 5 stars easily.
B0019M2ITY|3.0|The watch is okay, but the crystal stuff on the band was easily been detached. A bit disapponited with the swatch quality.
0756655730|5.0|Very informative book, lots of color illustrations and pictures.  Book is huge. From 4.6 billion years ago to current times.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I like this app and yes it does look like a stupid little kid game but its addicting it has good graphics and it's fun
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I highly recommend taking this journey!  interesting puzzles, great scenes &amp; relaxing music. I hope the dev makes another soon!
0385335997|5.0|The third novel in the series is an exceptional read!  It's great to find a historical fiction series that is so well written.  I'm so invested in the characters, and am so glad there are more books in the series.  I'm not ready to say goodbye to Claire and Jamie!
B004LWZW7E|2.0|What if time is really money? \\"The Truman Show\\" screenwriter Andrew Niccol's latest film takes the idea of \\"time as currency\\" seriously. Set in an unspecified future world, a sci-fi thriller \\"In Time\\" gives another meaning to a frequently used phrase \\"wasting one's time.\\" Here the class structures of the haves and the have-nots are determined by the time left to live, shown by the internal \\"body clock\\" on the wrist.  Many people say the idea is interesting. Maybe. But no matter how good the ideas may be, they need to be developed to be turned into a drama with a story. Andrew Niccol, the director of brilliant \\"Gattaca,\\" seems to have forgotten that. The rest of \\"In Time\\" is a tepid action flick that does not what it wants to do, that is made up of bits and pieces borrowed from other action movies.  All characters are stock types. Justin Timberlake is one of the \\"have-nots,\\" hard-working Will Salas. Amanda Seyfried is Sylvia Weis, a daughter of a rich family. Cillian Murphy is Raymond Leon, a veteran \\"timekeeper.\\" Throughout the film, what they really want to do is never fully explained. (What does Murphy's \\"timekeeper\\" have to keep anyway?) The subplot about Johnny Galecki's character, friend of Timberlake's hero, is terribly bland.  There are so many holes in the plot, but the biggest problem of the film is its inept storytelling and lack of characters we can identify with. We don't need car chases. We don't need guns. We need someone like Truman Burbank whom we really cared about. Sadly \\"In Time\\" doesn't have one.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Games are a good way to kill some time.  Some of them are hard because the graphics are bad but overall it's fun.
0393064476|4.0|Greenblatt has a firm command of English style, and I enjoyed reading this National Book Award winner despite the author's overt anti-Christianity and my distaste for his protagonist, the humanist G. F. Poggio Bracciolini (1380 - 1459), who (as Greenblatt forthrightly reveals) served with complacency in the \\"lie factory\\" of half a dozen Renaissance popes.<br /><br />Greenblatt's questionable subtitle has been noted in both professional and readers' reviews.  I make two small points.  First, the emphasis on pain that Greenblatt associates with Christianity was a medieval rather than a biblical notion.  St. Paul calls the asceticism of those who would \\"forbid marriage and advocate abstaining from foods\\" the \\"doctrine of demons\\"; and he emphasizes that \\"everything created by God is good.\\" (1 Tim. 4. 1-4)  It was the Reformation, far more than the rediscovery of Lucretius, that made the world \\"modern\\" in terms of restoring a healthier appreciation of human pleasure.<br /><br />Second, it is questionable that Jefferson's phrase \\"pursuit of Happiness\\" arose from Lucretius; or at least it's doubtful that the Continental Congress--which had a mind to tinker--would have accepted the phrase had it been known to have originated with Lucretius.  A far more likely source is Blackstone's Commentaries, where the pursuit of happiness is said to be a theological foundation for \\"what we call ethics, or natural law.\\" (I.1.2)
0786838655|4.0|It is going to be quite some time before all new child/teen fantasy is NOT compared with Harry Potter.  This series compares most favorably even if the characters and situations are not quite as fleshed out.  As an \\"older\\" reader who enjoyed the Potter books immensely, I also enjoyed this series.  Riordan has created interesting characters and situations.  I have been enamored with Greek mythology, gods, and mortals since I was a child.  In 8th grade, I devoured Edith Hamilton's \\"Mythology\\"... and I wished there had been more.  I feel that I've found \\"more\\" in Rick Riordan's books which merge the mythology of the past with life of today.  Most enjoyable.
B006UG90RM|3.0|No hits here.  The band reunites with David Lee Roth but no hit songs come from this collaboration.  I personally prefer the hits from the Sammy years.  The input from Michael Antony is also missing.  Guitars are great as is to be expected from EVD but overall, a good album but not great.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Great keyboard because it saves you from typing alot of words and or sentences again. I would definitely download it again.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I'm really enjoying this game. I've only started, but keep finding new little twists. Simple enough for small children. Quick enough to get in a quick game while waiting in line.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Amazingly awesome   I could not believe how fun it is. It was really fun and challanging. I love this game.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Wow. I always look at the game of the day so I got this caus I had nothing to lose and I'm sure glad I did caus its my new favorite game! Get this game and you'll be glad you did.

B006ON41FC|4.0|I really liked it because it is fun and addictive even for kindle fire users. I rated it 4 stars because it isn't super addictive
B006ON41FC|4.0|its a fun past time to play this game, especially when you collect enough nuts for the store. GO NUTS!
B006ON41FC|4.0|a fun addicting game almost as addicting as angry birds at least as long as there is time to waste
0439023483|5.0|This  book had me staying up at night! The characters are young teens who live in a world that is 1984/post-apocalyptic. The main thread is that in this world, there are various provinces and a 'capital,' but people who live out in the provinces are under the thumb of the capital. They have to sacrifice a boy and girl each year to participate in lethal hunger games - where only one victor may reign. Thse hunger games serve two purposes: to keep the provinces in fear and remind them who's boss (the capital with its technological prowess) and secondly to provide entertainment to the desensitized and out-of-touch capital residents. The fierce Everdeen volunteers herself to participate and so begin the feverish and thrilling hunger games. The first book in this trilogy leaves you wanting for more and although the sequels are not quite up to par with the first book, I recommend keeping them handy. The writing is thrilling and quick. The characters are well-developed and inspire a sense of endearment; the only drawback is that Everdeen appears at times clueless and overly suspicious - but maybe that's due in part to her insecurities as a teenager. It might be natural for her to be doubtful of other people's intent (like Peeta) after growing up in a hostile environment. This was a memorable book for me that I couldn't put down. I bought the trilogy package for my sister and she loved it!
B006ON41FC|5.0|Great game! Its fun for any age and the upgrades that you can buy make the game far more addictive than it is already. Buy it now while its free
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This third installment drifted from the first two books - but this drifting was simply a development of the story as it was bound to happen. The first two books show a picture of unrest in the provinces and understated moments of rebellion; this book unveils the moral of the story. It's more of a big picture than small picture - so Everdeen does get lost in the midst somewhat. But even though some readers may find that disconcerting, I think it was absolutely necessary. The characters continue to develop and Everdeen stays true to herself up until the end. There were moments where I felt the action was too slow or the involvement by Everdeen was limited; but in many ways it would have been unrealistic for Everdeen to be a 'leader' with more power in this book. She does wallow a bit, but even that appears true to her character's programming - she's not used to being on the sidelines - but she has to because she's not in charge. Although the unfolding of events at the end of the book is somewhat rushed and unbelievable, the conclusion is appropriate and satisfying. As young as she is Everdeen is wise and strikes a move that some readers may find surprising at the end. She does what she has to do in order to guarantee that rebellion does not bear another tyranny. This is vague but you will know what I men once you've read it. Unlike the other two books, I would recommend this to Animal Farm lovers - who will find kinship with Collins.
B006PHD0RW|1.0|This game is a pain in the butt. It doesn't let you move the stuff sometimes. I just don't like this game at all. I'm glad it was free. Don't pay money for this app.
0439023491|4.0|Although this book was not quite as good as the first one, it definitely held my attention. I anticipated where this was going to go - because what else would Everdeen do but participate in another Hunger Games tournament? It did not feel contrived as one might think.Yes, after reading the first book - the excitement of discovering what the hunger games were all about is gone - but it's replaced by a sober recognition that the story is more profound than it originally appeared. Things are not what they seem and as a reader you will be wondering who is on whose side just as Everdeen ponders the same question while the games unfold in expected and unexpected ways. I thought that the direction of this sequel was thoughtful and well-constructed, setting up the inevitable third book. I highly recommend this book to those who read the first book.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game had tons of random and fun games to pass the time and i love the points concept. My only negative point is that the games are pretty basic =) but i do recommend it because of the very wide selection of different games to play =) Hope this was helpful x
B006ON41FC|4.0|this app is really cute and very addictive. my kids and I really love it.so glad I got this as the free game of the day.

B005NPLXJ4|1.0|Regardless of whether you have a religious bone in your body or not, you have to admit vanity is one bad sin when it leaves albums like this in its wake.<br /><br />First off, I see some reviewers on here claiming that Lulu is so bad that it will likely develop a cult status in 20 years much the same way Metal Machine Music has in recent times. I would like to take the time to nip that comparison in the bud by simply saying that MMM has some redeeming qualities. I dare anyone to try to think during any part of the one hour long duration of the tuneless layers of guitar feedback. It is literally impossible to maintain a working brain during that time and this is a good thing for it gives the brain a chance to reset and start all over. I highly recommend [[ASIN:B00004VXF2 Metal Machine Music]] to anyone who has trouble dwelling on negative thoughts for the album will stop them cold for a full hour and do so without a single chemical entering your body. I am positive Lou Reed never intended MMM to be useful except for it being a major F*&^ YOU as Lester Bangs referred to it to basically everything with eardrums but espeically record company employees and their contractual obligations.<br /><br />I am sorry to say Lulu is not intended to be another FU album of any sort. This album required thought and in this sense it has zero redeeming qualities to it. If you would like to equate Lulu to something else, please link it to other horrific attempts to make something as lasting as Berlin or Magic and Loss or the Cale collaboration Songs for Drella. Lulu is closer to Reed's the Raven.<br /><br />Lulu lacks any kind of cohesion. There's Reed (obviously showing his age) singing and falling short on telling any kind of meaningful story because the music doesn't fit the mood. Metallica isn't helping matters by making the music louder than it probably should be considering the subject matter. I'd think a Reed/Metallica album would be about drug fueled fast living and a fiery burnout. Fast moving, fast living and predictably abrupt tragic endings, it's something all musicians involved witnessed and survived in their lives. Lulu, is a miserable character, low self esteem, driven even lower by circumstance and as much as I try to ignore the lyrics because they don't fit the music being played behind them, I can't. The question is, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING? WERE THEY THINKING? Or was this a Metallica jam session behind a Reed written piece he had lying around?<br /><br />Reed fans like me have reason to be sad but the sadness also carries over to any Metallica fan who still cherishes the Master of Puppets era of this once great band. I can see one of these fans taking his CD copy of Lulu and running it over with his '86 GMC Jimmy repeatedly, for days until it at least looked like a cool disc to have. If you are a fan of vintage Metallica (anything pre-Load because Load was a LOAD imo)  DON'T BUY LULU. There is nothing on here you will like. The band likely chose to do this album simply because they thought it would be cool to jam with the Great Grandfather of Alternative Rock N Roll. That my friends makes Lulu a vanity project and these endeavors almost never amount to anything for us fans except heartache.<br /><br />So if you are a fan of Metallica, please do not see this as a slap in the face. If you must fill the hole in your collection, get this with the instrumental tracks instead of the storyline Reed tries to stick to it.<br /><br />On the whole I feel this is just another example of a band who is on a very long losing streak. On their way down, they bumped into Lou Reed and they all together furthered their descent into obscurity. Do the noble thing with Metallica and Lou Reed, appreciate what they've done but avoid what they do.and predictably abrupt tragic endings, it's something all musicians involved witnessed and survived in their lives.

B004TI5N38|3.0|A bit of a disappointment for me.  Took too long to get going.  I just feel like Baldacci books have really been hit or miss lately.  I'm a huge fan and have read every one of his books, but am hoping for the next one to be as strong as his early books or as strong as the Camel Club series.
0071762345|5.0|A colleague recently gave me this book as a gift for Christmas. Working in film production, it was refreshing for me to see Kerpen offer clear and innovative ideas on \\"conversation\\" within the realm of social media -- something that is often misunderstood by companies and brands. This book has been a helpful resource for me and my colleagues to help our own company develop a voice, a clearer brand identity, and relationships with our audience. This led me to start following Likeable Media and Kerpen on Twitter. Recently, Kerpen offered to re-tweet his followers' messages for a dedicated amount of time. We sent him a link to our latest film project; he shared it to his audience of 16K! ...Which just goes to show that in the world of social media, when you give, more often than not, you get back too (hence this review)! :) Kerpen doesn't just write about social media conversation in his book. He practices what he preaches. Likeable Social Media a great business read and it has proven to be quite handy desk-side. Thanks to platforms like Twitter & Facebook, our company's audience continues to grow. And we have the opportunity to produce exciting content and listen with attentive ears.
B003YL4L0W|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!! I would recommend it to both gay and straight people, especially those that want to start families, it will give you a whole new appreication for the process.  This is an incredible story of the triumph of love after loss and of doing the right thing (in the end), even if you're not exactly sure what it is. There are parts that enrage you, parts that make you cry, and parts that warm the heart.  Overall FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|AWESOME!! Alex Kendrick and Sherwood Pictures hit a home-run, yet again, with this, their fourth Christian-themed movie. This one concerns fathers and the important rolls they play in the lives of their children and how a lack of an adequate roll model can leave really negative effects on them and how, if fathers will step up to the plate and commit to doing all they can for and with their children, it will have a have a positive and encouraging effect on them that will go a long way in enabling both sons and daughters to succeed in life. Two thumbs WAY UP for a great movie!
B004GUSG4M|3.0|(Mild spoilers)Christine Lucas wakes up every morning next to a man she doesn't know in a house she doesn't recognize. Every morning, the man, who tells her he's her husband and they've been married for over 20 years, has to explain to her that she had an accident which resulted in an unusual form of amnesia. She's able to retain memories for a day at a time, but once she goes to bed each night, the memories are erased and she wakes up in the morning thinking she's still a young woman in her twenties instead of a woman in her forties.<br /><br />I heard so many great things about this book; I really wanted to like it. It started off well, but then it became really repetitive. I get that it had to be somewhat repetitive based on the premise, but this book would have been better served as a short story. There was so much that I didn't need to read over and over.<br /><br />The journal sections of the book struck me as extremely unrealistic. I've written in a journal and read other journals, and none have ever read as a novel. Full of complete dialogue, paragraphs upon paragraphs about how much time she didn't have to write in the journal, which seems like a silly waste of the precious time.<br /><br />And the big reveal at the end asked me to suspend my disbelief to a level I'm not really prepared to. How on earth would a person be able to take another person, a person suffering from a terrible mental problem, who needed almost constant care, out of the hospital by just informing everyone he was her husband with no one checking, no one verifying anything he said??? It's so unrealistic. And everyone in Christine's life - husband, son, best friend - they all just decide to not check on her at all, not talk to each other, not visit her once in months? It was too much to ask me to buy into.

B004EPYZZI|5.0|Recently I saw an advertisement for Soul Surfer on another movie. Thrilled to know the Blu-ray was available, I immediately bought it. My husband and I watched it as soon as it arrived. [I remember when the attack happened and following her for a few years as she made her comback. I was amazed at how fast she returned to the water and surfing.] I cried and laughed respectively through the entire movie. You are drawn into it immediately and it almost feels as though you are there going through everything with them personally. This movie depects more than just the facts. It reaches into the very heart and emotions of Bethany and her family and friends. Showing the grief, determanation, and their faith in God that altogether brought them through and turned what could have been a tragedy into a positive outlook that in turn inspired others.  I highly recommend it to young and older alike. I know that I'll rewatch it many times, and intend to watch it with my grandchildren. It's on my favorite list.

Owning that I am not a die hard fan of theirs, I could not find one single song on this album I didn't like. That's not something I can easily say. Even about the artists I am a die hard fan of. The digital enhancements, in my opinion, didn't deduct from the heaviness this band portrays at all. If old fans find it hard to open themselves up to the change in their sound (which I can understand) I can gaurantee there will be 1000's of new fans willing to step up to replace them, including myself! The heavy metal gods have blessed this collaboration and the end result is the birthing of a true masterpiece!
B004MWI2M0|4.0|This was for my grandson who is a Lego fanatic. He could not wait to get this one!  This is a very challenging toy.
145551389X|5.0|I bought this book as a Christmas Gift for my wife. She's a huge Lady Gaga fan. The book is a collection of photos from her MonsterBall Tour. Very cool inside look at the tour and Lady Gaga's moments off the stage. Just photos.  As a side note, this might not be suitable for the Little Monsters out there. And by that, I mean children, haha.
1904994768|4.0|Loved reading about new records being broken in the gaming world. Very recommended for hardcore fans. I enjoyed the 2011 edition a little bit more, but this is still great.
B00070DK1E|4.0|I remember the cool afternoon in 1987 when the DJ announced a new album from Jethro Tull, and then he proceed to play \\"Steel Monkey\\". I was hooked on that opening act and went out that day and bought the cassette. Now I had a \\"Farm On The Freeway\\" and a \\"Jump Start\\" on what I consider an excellent Tull album. I recently purchased this one on a remastered CD to keep my mp3 files loaded with the older classic rock. I hate the fact that albums such as this one don't make the cut. And this one, A GRAMMY AWARD WINNER should be a no brainer. So do yourself a favor and get an album that may be easy to miss, but don't. Then try J.Tull Dot com and realize why this band still rocks.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is so much fun to have so many games to play and get coins to spend and get new games
B0063GORYU|4.0|I like the fact that you can make it harder and more challenging or keep it easy when you don't want to think that hard.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun for the kids while we are on the go, when we have those long trips to travel where we want and they can play all they want while I enjoy relaxing without them screaming at eachother.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Fun and simple, yet a challenge.  It changes every hand, so it is always new and different each time you deal.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this app, its fun and silly. I would suggest to listen to those saying not to use the openfeint. I haven't tried only because I WAS SMART AND READ THE REVIEWS FIRST BERFORE PLAYING!!!
B005JABSB6|5.0|I have 4 pair. All work perfect with my Sharp Aquos LC-70LE735U 3D TV. Comfortable, battery holds a charge for a very long time under use.  No complaints.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It took me 48 hours to read The Hunger Games - I simply could not put it down.  I must admit I was a little wary of what I would find when I first cracked the cover.  The book was written to target the Young Adult audience, and I feared the prose would be dumbed down, the story muted.  This is certainly not the case.  There's been so much hype about the series, I was also a little afraid it would fall short of my expectations.  Instead, The Hunger Games surpassed my expectations.  I was drawn in from the very first page.  Suzanne Collins does a fantastic job of mentioning the Reaping and the Hunger Games early on without waddling into useless backstory.  She teases us with the names as she dives into Katniss' life.  The story is written in present tense, which is hard to pull off for a complete novel.  Collins handled perfectly.  After the first few sentences, I didn't even notice the different tense anymore.  The world of the Hunger Games is dreary, it is broken, and yet fascinating.  Collins describes it well, putting me into that world and letting me marvel in it without drowning me in needless paragraphs of description.  The concept of the story is fascinating, the characters even more so.  There's romance - but it's subtle, it's confused, and not in the slightest cheesy.  Katniss is independent and strong, a wonderful protagonist.  All in all, I was thrilled by this book.  I can't wait to get my hands on the next ones.
B006ON41FC|5.0|the game is really fun but the popups are annoying. but I guess now that I have written a reveiw they'll stop.
B005K17RU0|5.0|getting an accurate forecast is easy with accuweather; makes getting ready to go to work so much more convenient and I don't walk out the door thinking I should have worn something different or grabbed an umbrella

B006ON41FC|1.0|I bought a permanent boost for 4000 nuts and when I played it didn't t show up!!!!!!! that was most pf my nuts.
B006JPS1OM|1.0|When you tap on items nothing happens. maybe I'm doing something wrong. But I give up. Is there something I need to do.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|When i first opened the package containing the case i messed around with it and soon fell in love.  The case is lightweight, easy fitting for the kindle fire (unlike other cases i have seen), and simple to stand up for watching movies or reading books.  The case also has a soft backing for the lid/cover protecting the screen.  I have had the case for months and still think the case is the best.  Over all this is probally one of the best cases out there.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is about a squirrel who needs nuts to buy stuff and if you are reading this review I have one last thing to say and it's this game is awesome.
1400079144|1.0|This is 4th title from Dan Brown that I've read and by far the worst.  Never really got exciting and to be honset I was thinking of not finishing it at one point.  The plot is poor the characters all seemed a bit too familiar and the links with the Masons and other were drawn out and frankly dull.
B006UG90RM|5.0|VERY good comeback album.  The Mighty Van Halen IS BACK!  The guitar solos at the middle to end of each song are KILLER and I love MOST of the songs on here.  BUY IT TODAY if you love rock!
B003Y5H5HO|4.0|Great characters and I can understand why the author has capitalised on this with the book series.  From the start the book gets you gripped and ha a good set of plots that don't naturally lead into one another but still make for a good read.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I love Evernote. The best feature is being able to email yourself a note and seeing your notes on the web.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Very good to play.  Great playing on kindle fire! Good game for adults or kids.Gotta love these free games. :)
B006ON41FC|5.0|I read a lot of negative results and I'm not getting it. This game has snazzy graphics and is addicting as heck. I don't mind the whole Openfeint program maybe cause I don't understand it but oh well. Love playing this on my Kindle Fire.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Very addictive game. Great for wasting time. Once I started playing, it was tough to stop. Tell your friends about this one.
B005HSL626|5.0|this game is soooooooo fun and if you do get this app be sure to play the arcade mode it is so fun. Also if you get this app don't fall for any of the scans just click skip
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Love the interview style writing. Im not a fan of zombie stories but my boyfriend talked me into this one. I have to admit I liked it. Tho it got a bit slow in parts.

B0051BNRTO|4.0|This was a fun, quick read. Some situations did seem a bit contrived but somehow I only noticed this once they reached their logical conclusion. The ending was not completely satisfying but there were a lot of laugh, out-loud moments for me in this book.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|The app is fantastic. Love the fact that it covers the whole KJV, the perk? It is in audio also. However I do not like the fact that it won't be opened to read or listen to without the use of the internet. Ethernet or WiFi.
B006ON41FC|2.0|I do not like fact that you must be on the net to gain acsess to the in game store this needs to be rectified
B006ON41FC|1.0|To much lag, this game would actually be good it weren't so laggy. Good thing its free, I would be freakin pissed if I paid for this sticky mess of a game

B004SC7B6M|2.0|After Within Temptation's stunning 2005 release \\"The Silent Force\\" and the powerhouse that was their 2007 release \\"The Heart of Everything\\" (in which every song was worthy of a single) , \\"The Unforgiving\\" is a huge let-down.<br /><br />Though there were several songs that I found myself warming up to after a third listening ( such as \\"A Shot in the Dark\\", \\"Sinead\\" and \\"Lost\\") , The Unforgiving is largely redundant and therefore a bore. The songs get downright formulaic. A set number of repeat choruses (of which there are far too many for my taste),  with no variation whatsoever in the way a phrase is sung from repeat to repeat. A guitar solo or song breakdown is in the same place in nearly every single song. There were no pleasant surprises. Everything was just too predictable. I even bought the digital version specifically for the three additional songs that were not included on the hard-copy release of The Unforgiving, and yet I find myself skipping over more than half of the 15 songs when I listen to the album. Even the songs I've become fond of are not on my list of Within Temptation favorites.<br /><br />My two biggest problems with \\"The Unforgiving\\" are the lyrics and the song compositions. Sharon's voice is still polished and, as ever, improving in strength and range. The band plays with skill and experience. However, the songs just don't have the breadth and scope of those on previous albums. The lyrics are lackluster and even a little laughable at times ( read: \\"Murder\\"). The Unforgiving is a concept album based on a companion comic book series, but without the comic to supplement, the songs don't actually tell an intelligible story. They don't stand on their own. One literally NEEDS the comic book to understand what the album is trying to convey. It's an interesting marketing ploy but unfortunately turns the album into a glorified commercial. I don't want to be sold a comic. I want a good piece of music that I can enjoy.<br /><br />I count Within Temptation among my favorite bands and only hope that their next album it isn't as disappointing as The Unforgiving.only hope that their next album it isn't as disappointing as The Unforgiving.
B006ON41FC|4.0|I read that some people didn't like this game so I went to try it out couldn't stop playing! until my Kindle's battery went out.
B006ON41FC|4.0|a nice simple fun game you fillet nuts and buy items with those collected I haven't gotten a free app this fun in a long time
B006SV2LWA|2.0|The movie starts off with disease 'contagion' already in process, quickly transitioning from location to location, person to person.  The continuous thread is the CDC's effort to understand and manage. Typically, I enjoy this type of movie.  As I watched it, I couldn't put my finger on why I was not fully engaged and drawn in to the dynamics of the movie progression and the story.  I compared my memory of watching \\"outbreak\\", and I remembered the movie started with showing the audience the innocent mistake that caused the illness, introduced us to the source victim, and the 'realness' of the CDC workers. This caused opened three pathways for the audience experience:  1)the worry for the health of the CDC workers  2)obtain an emotional attachment to the source victim in a way that that same hope/concern could be applied to all outbreak victims, and  3)the astonishment of how a serious of innocuous events could multiply into an astounding impact.  Contagion completed this in a different order. In one way that made it very unpredictable because of the lack of foreshadowing. In another way, the same technique made it hard to follow.  There was also another plot line which dealt with the pharmaceutical beneficiary component of medicine as well as the insidiousness of opportunistic individuals during a time when humanity should be prevailing.  Though I think this is a topic worth exploring, since this was a continuous thread through a movie that I had no other true connection to good characters (because they were all introduced in pieces) to connect to their story-line, it made for a bitter taste during a confusing review.  At the end of the movie all of the pieces come together and you understand. Though the way it is done, you could almost miss the critical revelation which connects all the pieces. I watched the movie again (since I had it for a few days), it made much more sense on the second pass, you could see all the victims and how they passed it, you there was a lot more dynamic energy to it though there was still an emptiness as the only characters you could empathize with was the head of CDC and the husband who lost his wife. For me that just wasn't enough of a redeeming inspiring connection.  In the end, though I loved a lot of the lead characters, I wouldn't recommend this movie. If you are in the mood for this kind of movie, dust off OUTBREAK.
B006ON41FC|3.0|I really only have one complaint, better controls would be great. It feels like the controls are slow to respond on my Xoom. Unlike most of the other reviewers Open feint is not that big of a deal to me, I just turn off my Wifi If I don't want to be bothered by it. Over all it was a fun game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I don't know what to say most of the games are sweet.  before I downloaded it I just past the game.know I play it every day.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Lana Del Rey has the spirit of a Nancy Sinatra. She is not only talented vocally but is also a very interesting artist
0385534639|5.0|I loved this story from the beginning. I thought it was well written with wonderful descriptive details. I could easily imagine myself at the night circus. I also found the \\"game\\" interesting and loved how everything ended. I would definitely recommend others give this book a go, you won't be disappointed.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I've tried a few of the office packages and while I EAGERLY await Softmaker Office for Android, this is a good office package for now.  Reads and writes MS files without issue.  Good editing support and functionality in Word and Excel documents. Support is actively fixing bugs.  Handles keyboard and mouse well in Honeycomb!  Just plug in a wireless Kbd/Mouse and you're really getting things done. Most of the productivity you need is here.  Who needs that BLOATED mess known as MS Office :-)

B000G73UEU|5.0|the singers here clearly like Cohen and most of the songs are just lovely.  Martha Wainwright doesn't work for me, but Teddy Thompson was a revelation.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I'm playing this on a kindle fire and it is awesome. I don't have any problems with open feint. But the music is so annoying
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I love this u could stray up all night on this app. It has a huge variety of choices! 5 Stars!!!
B006ZS81GG|5.0|I had never heard of Lana Del Rey until I saw her performance on Saturday Night Live. I was so captivated by her voice, I didn't even notice her stagefright until I heard all the media buzz about it a couple of days later. All I knew when I heard her perform was that here was an original with a sultry singing style I'd never heard the like of before, and I was immediately mesmerized. Her lyrics were memorable (\\"Heaven is a place on earth with you,\\" Video Games) and the instrumentation lush and entrancing. After hearing the studio versions of her songs on this outstanding album, I can now detect the stagefright in her SNL performance, but so what? That just makes me like her more, for being a real woman who can still be overwhelmed by it all.  How can there possibly be so much negativity about this talented ingenue? I don't care if she changed her name or gave in to some unfortunate pressures to be physically perfect - Lana Del Rey is an artist to take seriously and take notice of. I think people sometimes jump on the critical bandwagon when someone becomes famous very quickly.... perhaps it is just envy, which is understandable given Ms Del Rey's talents. I love this album and know we will be hearing much more from her. Go Lana aka Lizzie, and thank you for your beautiful, unique music!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it was awesome I love it some of the games are hard but its fun I absolutely loved this awesome game
B006ISJQBM|2.0|I kept watching hoping that the ending would provide some satisfaction, but it didn't. The characters are not appealing in any way - none of them. It is just a depressing movie about alcoholics and criminal behaviour. I kept hoping for something positive to occur, but it didn't. The movie ends with the conclusion being told in text on the screen just before the credits, as if they also found it boring to make and couldn't be bothered to shoot the ending. Very disappointed in this movie.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This series was captivating! Much less gore than anticipated. The heroine was moving and I could NOT put the books down! Be sure you have ample time to read before starting:)
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  Before reading it I had known friends who said it was \\"profound\\" or \\"simply. wow!\\".  I didn't find it revolutionary, but it was a good story and a quick read.
B004Q7CIFI|1.0|this enhanced version is not compatible with the kindle nor the kindle fire.  whaaaat??  amazon what are you thinking??  kindle and kindle fire are you premier products and you put out an audio video book from a top selling author that is not compatible with that supposed premier e-reader.  what a set of calhoons!!  i've lost a lot of respect for you amazon.
B005T87QCI|5.0|it is so fun.  it is easy. and I love it. its cool.  I wish it had. zus. I like all robots it has. I play it all the time.

B006ON41FC|5.0|It's a great game. I don't know what people are complaining about. Not only is 3d but it's a flying squirrel for crying out loud.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is too fun, i have been addicted since i bought it! i love that you can buy new outfits and things too!
B000PC6A3E|5.0|If you like the Batman movies get this one. Looks great on blu-ray and was entertaining. I'm not going to give a long drawn out review and pick apart every aspect of the movie. Good price on Amazon and great shipping.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Better than the iPad case because of the elastic, the durability<br />and the design. It's not a cheap case. Fits like a glove! The stand<br />feature is working well.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is great. well worth the money. if you like challenges and fairly easy controls id highly recommend this game.
B006W0QOF2|1.0|I have no idea why they made this movie. If my name was on the credits, I'd be ashamed. It offers absolutely nothing to the viewer. Pass it by or be prepared for disappointment.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it. its Bible on the go. I can read it whenever and wherever. I also have it on my phone. love love love love this app.
1595141715|2.0|I truly had high hopes for this book. Reading a bunch of reviews, not just on Amazon, but I did do my research prior to purchasing. I tend to not pay attention to bad reviews for anything and give whatever story I'm about to get into the benefit of the doubt. I'm one of those readers that like tearjerkers, so the synopsis of the book seemed promising. The use of audio tapes as the voice of Hannah Baker, with dual narration with clay was indeed creative. And the plot reminded me of \\"Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon\\" but instead, 13 Degrees of Hannah Baker.  The story did pull me in much like a thriller, and it took me only a day to read this. I admit, I couldn't put the book down. But it was only in hopes that the story would get even better. But to my demise it didn't. Teen suicide is such a sensitive and sad topic, especially after watching the HBO documentary \\"Boy Interrupted\\", and hearing about real teen suicides and their reasons.  The book started off good and intriguing, but some parts made Hannah Baker seem a little creepy. But I just kept reading to really find a justified reason to empathize with her suicide. But I couldn't find a \\"real\\" reason.  And the premise of it all seemed so trivial compared to what some of the other characters in this book went through and what she put them through.  She kind of just made me angry, her character was just far too sarcastic to even feel like she was depressed. The tone of Hannah Baker made it almost hard for me to feel sorry for her. Quite frankly she seemed like a jerk and bully almost. Or maybe its because I didn't translate her tone in my head very well. Either way I found it to be such a cowardly move for her to confront these people after she has already taken her life instead of recognizing what the actual problem was and addressing it to actually make a difference and possibly help other kids in crisis going through the same thing. So if you're looking for that kind of book this isn't it.  If it weren't for Clay's character, I would of rated this book a 1 star. Because he's the character I really connected with, the one I really felt bad for. But even that, to me he was the main character, and his portion of the tapes were only a few pages. Clearly he was fond of this girl, and his feelings for her started to unfold throughout the story, but it leads you nowhere.  The whole book was really about Hannah coming up with reasons and blaming it on other people, I mean, I understand, some of what she went through must of been painful, sexual harassment is serious. But at the same time some of her actions that lead to her suicide just made her seem selfish. It's like she wanted more of a valid reason to end her life, so she created one. But I guess you have to understand, this girls is a young teen, and I remember when I was that age anything could strike a series of depression, and raging hormones could cause extreme irrational behavior.  Its kind of hard say this but, If you're going to write a book on what lead to a fictional teen suicide, then the reasons should've been more deep to resonate with the reader. But I guess It's because Jay Asher never knew what it felt like to be a teenage girl. And if it was a book to make you realize how your actions affect other people, then that topic should of been more emphasized towards the end to give us a sense of what the \\"moral of the story\\" was.  Those reading this review please don't be discouraged to buy this book. Give it a chance, you never know you just might like it.
1401937519|5.0|I heard about this book on the Wayne Dyer radio show.  And I just was so curious about it. AMAZING.  It is the Best book I have ever read.  Her message is so simple and just puts everything in perspective.  We complicate things way too much, and life is quite simple if we CHOOSE to make it.  This book is inspiring, and has for ever changed my outlook on life and how I previously viewed my many fears.  Thank you so much for sharing you amazing journey with us.  I just have a hard time to put into words how this book has changed me.  Blessings,  Melanie Armstrong

Starting book one now, I hope to finish reading it tonight, but might have to read all 3 as I've read that all books have amazing cliffhangers.  So glad it is Friday so I can read Not a Twilight fan at all, but The Hunger Games is just WOW!  Had to read them before going to see the movie in March!!!!

B005LLX582|5.0|The Tree of Life is not only a movie, but an experience. It's a visually stunning, deeply moving and perfectly acted film. And if you know what to expect, you may enjoy it as much as I did.<br /><br />But be warned. The Tree of Life does not have a linear narrative, and doesn't tell a story as much as it shows it. And the regular viewer--that is, most of us--, used to be told in images and words what we are supposed to see and feel, may find this story hard to follow.<br /><br />The movie starts with a flaming light and a quotation from the Book of Job: \\"Where were you when I laid the earth's foundation...while the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy?\\"<br /><br />Then we are shown a woman (Jessica Chastain) as she learns in a letter the death of her son, age 19. In her grief and despair, enhanced by the absence of sound in the subsequent images, the mother questions God's design in such a seemingly cruel act.<br /><br />From here, the movie proceeds in two alternating levels. One shows the creation of the universe, the gathering of dust that made the planets, the apparition of microscopic life, scenes from the time of the dinosaurs and the destruction of most life on Earth as a consequence of a meteor hitting our planet.<br /><br />In another level we are shown images from the life of a contemporary middle aged man (Sean Penn): his birth in the 1950s to a loving mother (Jessica Chastain), his growing up in Texas under a strict father (Brad Pitt), his rebellion as an adolescent and his relationship with his two younger brothers. The second, the one he is closer to, will die later at 19 as we learned at the beginning of the movie.<br /><br />The story unfolds in pieces and bits, the way our memory works: some scenes from our past are vividly clear while others are lost. The overall picture that unfolds is both that of a unique human being and an universal story.<br /><br />If the movie sounds dreadfully boring, it's my fault. The Tree of Life maybe slow but it's never boring.<br /><br />So, in conclusion, if you want an adrenaline rush, a fast moving thriller or a light comedy, don't watch The Tree of Life. But if you want to take a break from a too stressful life and step in a world made out of memories and dreams.

B005MYEQ4U|4.0|As Midnight in Paris starts Gil (Owen Wilson), an American scriptwriter is visiting Paris with his rich fiancée Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her very Republicans parents.  Gil and Inez do not agree in many things, not in the things that count, anyway, like where they'd like to live (Gil in Paris, Inez in California), what to do for work (Gil wants to write a novel, Inez wants him to write scripts for Hollywood movies), or how interesting is Paul, the pseudo intellectual American friend they meet in Paris by chance. They definitely do not agree on where to spend their nights. Gil loves walking around, especially in the rain. Inez wants to go dancing, especially with Paul.  And so it is that during his walks, one night, Gil is transported to 1920s Paris where the likes of Scott Fitzgerald and his moody wife Zelda, Hemingway, Pablo Picasso and Gertrude Stein rule.  How this happens and how Gil returns to the XXI century in the morning and then again to the past every night we never know. Not that it matters, because the magic of Paris works on the viewer as it does on the confused protagonist and I, for one, was happy to follow him and witness his falling in love, in no particular order, with the 20s, a girl from the past, and the city of Paris.  The city is beautiful, the characters, endearing, and the plot cleverly romantic. What is there not to like?

B006ON41FC|5.0|I got this game as the Free App of the Day at around 2:30 in the morning, and decided to try it out right then.  Next thing I knew, it was almost 5 am!  It's very simple, but most highly addictive games usually are.  Plus the squirrel character is really cute.

B006ON41FC|3.0|So, how far can you go?  Game ends when your squirrel hits something.  Yay.<br /><br />Some 1 star reviews are funny.  Yes, those who don't like Open Feint REALLY don't like it.  Anything that forces an extraneous connection to a service not being used by the user is a buzz kill.  But to say Open Feint (or other social gaming additives like XBOX Live, PSN, or the iOS Game Center) is for kids in Junior High is like saying this game about a flying squirrel collecting nuts that are floating in the air is a game for all ages.  It is and it isn't for all ages.<br /><br />I don't take part in Open Feint for the social aspect, but for the achievements which add a whole new layer of gameplay to these simple single-layered smartphone games.  Games with Achievement support, are made more enjoyable and have something more to aim for than what may be provided directly through the game.<br /><br />To 1-star a game just because it uses Open Feint isn't entirely fair.  Consider the game itself before you bash their choice of add-ons.  Consider the developers \\"game design\\" and how Feint is an afterthought when considered in the design of a game about a flying squirrel going the distance.
B00433SVP6|5.0|I got this book for Christmas. I thought it was goin  to be worst book of my load, but it the best book ever!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|what caught my eye was the tank game, i love playing with tanks, but when I figured out I had to earn tokens to unlock it, I got POed. so I decided to play for the tokens, when I had enough to unlock tanks I played it and it sucked. I didn't mind it, there were plenty of other games, so I played it for a while and got bored so I deleted it. Basically, it's fun until you play it enough you'll want to delete it mostly because of the stupid tokens. That is, if you have little patience.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I'm super addicted to bag it!! Its so much fun and crazy. Nothing on my kindle is more fun than this game!
B006ON41FC|4.0|What's with all these poor ratings?  This game is great!  It is extremely simple and fun.  You fly around avoiding trees and collecting acorns.  You are able to shut off Open Feint.  When you first turn it on, it tells you how exactly HOW to.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|A fun game filled with many different games to choose from. There is something for everybody in this game. Some games are harder than others.
B006ON41FC|5.0|A totally fun game and worth getting!! It is simple but challenging enough to be fun. My kids have fun playing when they can get it away from me.
B000002KHF|5.0|Wow! What perfection sounds like.  Fresh every time you listen to it.  After almost 50 years still going strong; the rarest of rare quality production that keeps inspiring the listener to come back again and again.  Long may Moondance go on as one of the very best rock albums of the last half century; a treat for the senses every time it's played.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Loved it, great graphics, good puzzles.<br />I would definitely recommended this to anyone who likes this genre of game. Excellent!
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Adele 19, the rookie effort everybody is suddenly curious about. Well, you're right to be curious. After the stunning success of Adele 21...why not look back a bit to see if the genius was there all along waiting to be discovered. Guess what? It was there and in spades. The thrill with Adele 19 will linger long past it's prime along side Adele 21. Daydreamer, Melt My Heart to Stone, Crazy For You, Right As Rain, Chasing Pavements.....hell, they're all good. Adele is the best thing since sliced bread.....really.
0439023513|2.0|*WARNING SPOILERS*  I really loved the first two books in this trilogy and expected this one to be amazing. It is the end after all and the end is always the best part of a book. I actually loved it all, until I got to the end (ironic right?). I really liked Gale's character in the first two books but then Collins just decides to make him a creep in the end. She then goes further and makes Katniss like Peeta. Really? He wants to kill you. And you decide that you love him now of all times? I feel like I just read a hipster's diary. She made the end the opposite of what I thought, hoped, and wanted. The only reason I gave this book two stars is because of the previous two books. I actually had several people come and tell me, \\"don't read that book. You'll want to kill Katniss by the end.\\"I just thought they were psyching me out but no. They were telling the truth. So if there is one thing you take from my review, just don't read the book. Or you can do what I did and make up your own ending where Katniss gets the guy of her dreams (Gale, not Peeta), everyone stays alive, and that all live happily ever after. I know its cliche but I can't help it, I'm only human. Everyone likes a happy ending. Except Suzzane Collins apparently.
0143119680|5.0|I don't care what anybody says,this book was so awesome!!!! Loved it, loved it! I can't believe I read the whole thing in a span of a week and I have three kids and two dogs, oh yeah, a husband too. I could not put this book down, it took hold of me and would not let me leave this well written book go until I was finished. I cannot wait until the second one comes out this Summer! I am going to pre-order it today! I loved the characters, and fell for the vampire men in this book, so wickedly wrong, but it felt so right! Thank you Deborah Harkness for your time on such a gem!
B004XGN8W4|5.0|Ok so first of delivery. Arrived very fast and packaged securely. Tested the product for about 2 hours... Ok I'm lying, I'm still using the product and playing skyrim as your reading this. Screen is crystal clear, the pad the console sits on actually keeps it cool somehow. It does fit the regular non slim xbox 360. It certainly is portable. The only things that would make this product complete is probably a remote for the screen, a better set of speakers, some more storage, ie: game discs (I'm using a cd storage sleeve that you would use in a car sun visor, works great), the ability to truly be portable is if it had a rechargeable ion battery...cuz nothing sucks worse than not being able to find a 2 prong outlet in an executive class plane cabin. Oh also the case is rigid but I really don't recommend, dropping it or using it as a shield. Who knows maybe with all our pros and cons gathered they will develop an upgraded version of the product soon. All in all its well worth the money. Oh and for you married guys out there, prepare to be nag wife free, with this baby no longer will I have to stop playing just so she could watch American idol, mob wives, etc.

B004MPRWJG|2.0|The Lovely Bones has sold a million plus copies since its release about a decade ago and I finally got around to reading it. This is not a bad novel for fans of light reads(yes, this a light read even though the story is about a murdered child). The language is very simplistic and there is a clear cut desire to make sure that every plot point is neatly resolved. Also, the constant reminders that Susie Salmon is narrating from her personal heaven helps to offset some of the horror that a reader may feel regarding the violence. The novel has some interesting parts when showing how Suzie's loss affected her family and the different ways they deal with the loss. However, this becomes dull after a while as the loss is never expanded or elaborated on past the most obvious and blatant effects. Maybe this was intentional on Ms Sebold's part as the narrator is perennially 13 years old. Characters age in the novel and the reader watches them go through many different life stages but the they are never fully developed and sometimes the interactions between characters can seem overly simplistic and unnatural. Most frustrating to me was the cleanness of every resolution to every plot point, each plot point had to resolved in such a way that there was no room for interpretation and  that every conflict ended happily. In conclusion, this is a good book for young readers at the Jr High level (which I believe was the author's intended audience) and for a casual reader looking for a quick read. If you are a more serious reader this book is one to avoid simply because it has little to offer the more selective or critical reader.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a spectacular app filled with fun challenging games for people of all ages. also as you go along the games just keep getting better. i would recommend this to anyone.
0307474259|1.0|After hearing about Taubes' theories about exercise and weight loss (he doesn't believe exercise is an effective method of weight loss) through a friend, I took particular interest in reading these sections in both his \\"Good Calories Bad Calories\\" book and in \\"Why We Get Fat\\". As a new runner, I was specifically interested in the 2 \\"runner\\" studies he mentions. I took the time to read through the actual study papers he referenced to see if Taubes was providing a one-sided view, and if the studies themselves were valid. My conclusion: Taubes draws very convenient, but mostly invalid, conclusions from the studies. The studies he references are HUGELY flawed in that they do not control for caloric intake, they do not account for changes in body composition vs. weight loss, and they do not consider the fact that the studies start with healthy, non-obese individuals with healthy BMIs and bodyfat %-- not exactly the population to use when looking for the effectiveness of exercise on weight loss, is it?  Here's what I found:  1. Study referenced in \\"Good Calories Bad Calories\\" and \\"Why We Get Fat\\"- \\"Food intake and body composition in novice athletes during a training period to run a marathon\\"- Taubs used this to imply that not even marathon training is useful to weight loss:  - While the participants in this study were initially sedentary, they were not initially obese- and all had normal bodyfat readings (16% bf male, 24% bf female) when starting the study. Exercise will not continually cause fat loss to 0%- it will reach an equilibirum, and the participants in this study appear to have already been at a healthy weight / BF %, so this is not a good study to determine whether exercise leads to weight (and esp fat) loss in obese people or others who need to lose weight.  - Taubes states average weight loss for men was 5lbs. If he wanted to use a round number, 6lbs would have been more accurate (5.95lbs). More importantly, that's pretty decent weight loss for men with an average of 16% bodyfat to start with, but somehow this fact is used to imply the weight loss was not \\"enough\\". Again, these men were in a healthy bodyfat range, not obese, so why isn't this taken into consideration?  - The study reports no significant weight loss in women, but it does show loss in bodyfat in women, and it does not account for potential gains in muscle mass, which may explain the lack of weight loss  - Taubes refers to \\"body fat loss\\" in lbs, but the study measures and reports absolute weight loss in lbs instead- it reports body fat %, but not body fat loss in lbs.  - Study does not control/account for:  - Body composition changes- study reports weight loss without accounting for body composition changes (e.g., gaining X lbs of muscle, losing X lbs of fat may be a better result than simply losing X lbs of fat, but it is instead viewed as \\"lack of results of exercise for weight loss\\" by Taubes). Considering that \\"unhealthy weight\\" and \\"fat loss\\" are the key factors when discussing weight loss, this is misleading at best.  - Physical activity outside running  - Most importantly- study does not control for calories consumed! So runners are eating more when running (as stated in the study), and they are not losing a lot of weight, big surprise?  2. Study referenced in \\"Why we get fat\\": \\"The effects of changing exercise levels on weight and age-related weight gain\\"  Williams/Wood study. Taubes uses this study to imply that, not only is exercise ineffective when it comes to weight loss, but those that do exercise gain a \\"tolerance\\" to it than requires more and more exercise to produce the same weight loss results. Once again, a flawed take on a flawed study.  - The participants in this study were not obese- and all had normal BMIs when starting the study. Exercise will not continually cause fat/weight loss to 0- it will reach an equilibirum, and the participants in this study appear to have already been at healthy BMIs, so this is not a good study to determine whether exercise leads to weight (and esp fat) loss in people who need to lose weight- this was a study of a population of regular runners with normal BMIs.  - Taubes does not mention key points in the study that do not agree with his theory:  - \\"Changes in running distance were inversely related to changes in men's and women's bmis (slope±se: -0.015±0.001 and - 13 0.009±0.001 kg/m2 per *km/wk, respectively)\\"  - \\"Our data lend essential support for the hypothesis that vigorous 5 exercise promotes leanness. Because our analyses are based on changing levels of exercise, the associations are unlikely to arise from lean men and women choosing to run.\\"  - Taubes implies some sort of \\"immunity\\" to exercise that comes with a longer history of running, but he does not consider:  - Caloric intake is not controlled for (big one!)  - Weight/bodyfat may reach a healthy equilibirum, so little change may be seen in people with a long history of running  - Age-related metabolic slowing (common knowledge) which is shown in study: \\"when adjusted for *km/wk, years of aging in men and 21 years of aging in women were associated with increases of 22 0.066±0.005 and 0.056±0.005 kg/m2 in bmi, respectively, increases23 of 0.294±0.019 and 0.279±0.028% in *%body weight, respectively, 24 and increases of 0.203±0.016 and 0.271±0.032 cm in waist 25 circumference, respectively (all p<0.0001)\\" What about comparing this rate of weight gain with sedentary people? And again, what about caloric intake?  - Study does not control/account for:  - Body composition changes- study reports weight loss without accounting for body composition changes (e.g., gaining X lbs of muscle, losing X lbs of fat may be a better result than simply losing X lbs of fat, but it is instead viewed as \\"lack of results of exercise for weight loss\\" by Taubes). Considering that \\"unhealthy weight\\" and \\"fat loss\\" are the key factors when discussing weight loss, this is misleading at best.  - Physical activity outside running  - Most importantly- study does not control for calories consumed! So runners may be eating more when running, and they are not losing a lot of weight, big surprise? As the study authors state themselves: \\"our surveys lacked reliable data on changes in energy intake and other sources of energy expenditure that could account for some of the results reported here. Some of the change in body weight could reflect changes in caloric intake and other activities.\\"  3. Taubes states several times (ex pg. 37 why we get fat) his belief that exercise leads to increased caloric intake, but does not examine what happens if calories are controlled (i.e., exercise will lead to weight loss if caloric intake is controlled instead of increased when exercising).  Again, Taubes is twisting facts to fit his narrow view. Why doesn't Taubes reference studies that control or account for factors like caloric intake, BMI/bodyfat of study participants, and body composition changes? Maybe because they wouldn't agree with his viewpoint. I hope the pseudo-science presented in Taubes' \\"Exercise vs. Weightloss\\" claims aren't representative of the rest of the book, but the fact that he doesn't even mention these factors is enough for me to give the book 1 star based on this section alone. Taubes is not a scientist, a doctor, or even a nutritionist. He's a journalist. And it shows.

B0069UP2PI|5.0|The majority of the negative reviews are about \\"digital copy\\" issues. On the positive side it's rare to find producers, directors and writers collaborate in actually researching a topic and then presenting it to the public in such a way that it is not condescending, nor dumbed down but educative and entertaining. The biological sciences were accurately represented. They even tossed in a bit of alternative medicine to satisfy that audience. And, the social sciences were well represented in showing likely human responses to a sudden rapidly spreading infectious agent. Acting was superb as well as settings and props.  A serious subject that needs to be in the public forum for discussion. How many more lives we could save yearly if one percent of the politicized military budget were spent on upgrading research, labs, accessible communication between researchers and regulations to have drug companies share some research especially in areas in which they don't foresee any immediate benefit (oh, forgot, profit motive).
B0073LWEXK|2.0|I usually don't write reviews. However, I had to speak up about this one. I was tricked into buying this game by all the positive reviews. You have to run around from screen to screen constantly checking the map and scrolling down for hints to figure out where to go. Only to end up right back where you started. And for what? Nothing happens! Fade to black with a disembodied voice sprouting some closure statement. Two stars because it is pretty and some of the puzzles are mildly amusing.
055357342X|4.0|I had never read any of this series and happened to run across this book in the airport.  I bought it mainly because it looked interesting and it was BIG.  I enjoyed it on the plane and enjoyed it after I got home - until I got about half way through and then it was --WTF???  Just when you get involved with one character, BOOM, that chapter is over and you go on to someone else.  Hated it. Whoever made this editorial decision is on my lifelong black list.  I took my razor blade knife and took the book apart, chapter by chapter and then re-formed it, putting all the chapters of each character together.  Aaahhhh.  Much better.
B000QUEQBS|3.0|i know you cant expect a movie to be as good as the book its based off of but this movie had almost no actual similaritys other than (spoiler alert ohhh noooo) a sniper that got screwed. if this movie was just a movie and didn't claim any ties to the book (point of impact) it would have been pretty good. but by connecting itself to the book i expected somewhat of the same characters and story, i mean hell its not even in the same state and the fbi agent is kinda fruity compared to how he was portrayed in the book.  so if you haven't read the book i would recommend seeing this movie, its quite good on its own, but if you've read the book an expect this movie to be like the book, you will be extremely let down.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Ok, the fanboy in me was going to pick this up regardless of how good it was because it said Van Halen on the cover.  The fanboy in me was going to buy it because we got Diamond Dave on vocals. The fanboy in me was gonna like it regardless.  Fair enough.  Truth is, this album by any other band would be their break-out album.  This would turn any \\"average, slightly famous\\" band into superstars. It wouldn't matter who the singer is.  But, let's face it, we hold our Van Halen to different standards, and not only break out the microscope, but the telescope to scrutinize them.  Well, they heard we missed them...THEY'RE BACK!!!!! While not the best album from the Roth era, it is a great Halen album, with everything you expect from the first six albums.  It sort of reminds me of some of Dave's early solo stuff with Eddie on guitars. That isn't a bad thing. I love Dave's solo ventures, but it was never quite the same without Ed. I think this album, or something very similar, would have been their follow-up to 1984. But, yeah, great album. The songs scream old Van Halen. Like VH II to Fair Warning Van Halen. Buy this; listen to this; love this. It's been played once a day every day since I bought it the day after it was released.

0062082353|3.0|I read an article about this book's upcoming release and saw Mr. Kyle interviewed a couple times on TV. I thought the book would be an excellent read and indeed, I anxiously awaited its release date. While the book is an OK read, it is nowhere near the level I was led to believe it would be.  After a short retelling of a childhood growing up in Texas, learning how to shoot/hunt, doing OK in high school, working as a cowboy, dropping out of college, signing up for Navy SEAL training, etc., we get a few pages of life during BUD/S and then the story shifts to his duties as part of a SEAL team near Fallujah and Ramadi, respectively. I for one, would have liked to read a little more about the BUD/S training, if only because I think it accentuates the fact that it takes a special kind of man to make it through that arduous and death defying hell. What we then get is more or less a laundry list of how he was able to lay claim to the title &#34;the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history.&#34; It basically goes like this: he entered a town with a team and set up a sniper hide on the roof or in a room of a building. He would then shoot lots of insurgents at distances of just down the street to over 2000 yards away. Mr. Kyle would tell what the insurgent was doing when Mr. Kyle shot him, then it was on to the next one, and the next one, and the next one, and the next one. After awhile it got rather tedious. I mean, how many times can you read about someone shooting someone from a distance? There was very little about life in these war zones, no descriptions of what the SEALS and soldiers/Marines did to blow off steam, get exercise, relax, etc. Nothing really about how they were able to cope with being away from their families and loved ones.  So basically you get a long parade of scenes where Mr. Kyle shoots people from his sniper's position. It made me think that the enemy must be a collective group of dolts. I mean, they would see their fellow insurgents drop and die bya shot to the body while nobody else is around yet they continue to go about with their insurgent duties, basically becoming easy targets for Mr. Kyle. Just seemed strange that anyone would put themselves in such positions as this -- they seemed so easy to kill.  There are also passages written by Taya, Mr. Kyle's wife, where she would discuss everything from the day they met at a bar to how she was lonely raising one and then two children while Mr. Kyle was deployed. Maybe she and Mr. Kyle were two of the very few people on the face of the planet that did not know about the high divorce rate in the SEAL ranks and how tough it would be to raise a family with a spouse that would need to spend so much time in training or deployed with his team. After the first couple of Taya's passages, I found them to be annoying.  The book is not a bad read, I just think it could have been better. I have read reviews here that indicate it is a poorly written book -- I do not think this is the case. I remember noticing only one misspelling and felt that the narrative was not bad -- just boring.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I loved this game because it gets addicting. Also because it has one-hundred games in one. Every one has to get this game.
1400069289|4.0|The author tells so many interesting stories and I loved reading about them as I am fascinated about how marketing does and does not work.  I had fun reading this book but then it seemed to end before I got what I was expecting.  The author did talk on a very basic level about the brain and habits too but, just when I thought it was going to go more extensively into your brain and how it works and how to change it regarding habits, it was all over.  As someone else stated, this  although interesting, is not at all a step by step guide to mastering or changing habits. I think  people need really extensive information to tackle such a topic that often illudes so many of us.  I really enjoyed the book though.

B005VMVUAQ|4.0|Say what you will about the number of recipe films whose basic ingredients are rich people in beautiful houses who are raided by gangsters and held hostage in their own home only to turn the stakes on the perpetrators, but in the hands of director Joel Schumacher it is a pretty dependable fact that the intensity of the film will last from the opening titles to the closing credits.  TRESPASS is not a brilliant or unique film, but it is a quality piece of work. It has a script By Karl Gajdusek with some fine lines and quality twists that keep the audience guessing and enough innovative bits of action that make the film seem fresh (even if the behavior of all concerned is not to swift!).<br /><br />Kyle Miller (Nicholas Cage) appears obsessed with his business life - marketing diamonds - and comes home to his mansion (designed by his wife) where wife Sarah (Nicole Kidman) seems to be needing more than an income to make her life complete. They share a teenage daughter Avery (Liana Liberato) who is typically making her own decisions about socializing despite her parents objections: she sneaks out of the highly security guarded house to go to a naughty party. In the rush of all this there is a call at the door which when opened shows us four masked bandits who are there to rob the safe. The thugs are a strange assortment: the main speaker is Elias (the talented Ben Mendelsohn), his druggie girlfriend Petal (Jordana Spiro), Eiias' young brother Jonah (the hunky rising star Cam Gigandet), and the heavy Ty (Dash Mihok). The crooks want the safe opened but Kyle refuses, beginning to bargain with the thugs until the truth of his financial situation is made known. Sarah wants Kyle to open the safe, attempting to hide her own secret that involves Jonah.  Avery sneaks back home to find her parents beaten and held as hostages and all the secrets of all the cast are gradually revealed  - secrets that lead to an unexpected resolution.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage is Nicholas Cage, and it works for him.  The real star turns in the film are those by Ben Mendelsohn and Cam Gigandet.  Nicole Kidman provides solid support in her bifurcated role.  The movie is no great shakes, but it is a tense evening's entertainment. One surprise comes in the closing credits: they are rolled with some very soothing and beautiful movie music by David Buckley instead of the usual hardrock noisy song that most of these movies select to bring the film to a close.

B0028RXXE8|5.0|its great for those who are history buffs.i also realize that some of the parts are a bit much, but all in all i love it.i saw it when it first aired on H.B.O. years ago.iv watched it over and over since i purchased it.great actors.
B004LWZW8S|2.0|Visually, it is very good. The colors are brilliant. The special effects are very good. If you do see it make sure it is blu-ray.  The acting overall was quite good, I thought. I did like the acting of King Hyperion.  What let it down for me was the story which I thought was terrible.  So I would not see it again nor recommend it.
B006ON41FC|5.0|good way to waste time lots of fun hard challenges kids love it I have nothing else to say thx you
B001C08RHA|5.0|I ordered Iron Man for my husband for Valentine's day.  It arrived on Valentine's, but it was just an empty DVD case.  While initially quite upset, I contacted the store and was pleased that the representative was both quite apologetic and very proactive.  They said they'd sent out a replacement DVD first thing the next day.  Now, only four days later, I have the new copy.  It's in perfect condition and the original DVD at a more than reasonable price.
1452101248|5.0|I've made at least 10 recipes from this since getting it and it has plenty more bookmarked with post-its.  After making \\"beans with many spices\\" (green beans, peas, garbanzo beans in a beautifully spiced tomato sauce) I felt compelled to give it two thumbs up.  Awesome book, but perhaps not for the unadventurous chef as there are some unique ingredients and some are a bit time-consuming.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Trying to fly that squirrel is driving me NUTS with merryment. Super boosting through the trees, avoiding rotten nuts that make the squirrel sick and steering clear of hungry owels are just some of the obstacles I have flown through. Open feint? No problems on my Kindle. I give the whole five star rating.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Do not even consider watching this unless you've already seen season 1 of Downton Abbey. It's essential that you get to know the characters as well as the plots so you can go into season 2 well aware of what happened previously because the story threads make far more sense.<br />That said this season is every bit as interesting as the first. Downton is the story of the Grantham/Crawleys, a well-born and well heeled noble family and their servants. Much like its BBC precursor Upstairs/Downstairs, it deals with the issues that the wealthy and the working class encounter in their daily lives and the effects and ramifications that their actions may impact as they move on in the future. In this case, the driving plot is WWI and the changes that it brings to Downton. Added to the mix is the 1918 influenza epidemic, death, murder, romance, blackmail, infidelity, anarchy, and even tabloid journalism.<br />Unlike a typical soap opera, the season spans over a period of four years. However, the plots are introduced and resolved at a much faster pace than a weekday continuing serial. The writing is exceptionally good and the characters are fully developed. As far as the acting goes, it is top notch. The remarkable Maggie Smith plays the family matriarch with considerable sassiness and just Smith alone makes watching this a great experience. The same can be said of the rest of the cast. The characterizations aren't flat. I really forget these people are acting when I watch Downton.<br />Downton is crammed with intrigue, too.. What's not to like. It's become a favorite of mine because it is quality drama that never bores.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I enjoy playing this game. It's fun to try to fly through all of the obstacles. The game is also useful in keeping my 11 year old busy while I shop. I would recommend it for anyone.
B006ON41FC|5.0|awesome game. only bad thong wad open fient but you can disable it in the settings . they should have an opt out screen in the beginning thought. nonetheless nice game
B006ON41FC|4.0|what is openfient the game is fine nothing has bothered me so far its w good game i got no issues or complaints on my end
B005OCFHHK|2.0|I am adding this review not of the movies but of the quality of the Blu-Ray disks in the hopes that I can save others some trouble. We got these just to have the movies, we love the books but are not die-hard movie fans. We are now on our second set, and disk 7 has serious (not Sirius) flaws. The video and audio are out of sync in a significant portion of the film. In both cases, it was the part where Ron, Hermione, and Harry have been captured by snatchers and turned over to the Malfoy/Black family. Loads of close ups with long speeches, the audio being out of sync here completely ruins these scenes. The first set we had, the sync problem extended from the Ron Returns portion of the film through the beach scene. With the same problem in the same spot on the same disk (though slightly less duration the second time) I can only conclude there is a bad batch of these. I very much hope that the manufacturer simply had a bad day in quality control. I would hate to think they are passing these off in the multi-disk set.  My kids love these, and I hate to return them. But even as cheap as they are (~ $10 per disk) it's just not worth it when one of the movies is rendered unwatchable.
B006T5FDLG|4.0|So the four songs on Beyond Magnetic are supposed to have been the leftovers from when Metallica recorded [[ASIN:B00192KCQ0 Death Magnetic]] (see my review).  Comparisons are somewhat difficult since these are \\"rough mixes\\".  However, I can't imagine these having been included on their triumphant return in 2009.  These songs aren't bad, and I've been listening to them almost every day since I got the CD.  I think they are OK, but I don't know that old school fans are going to be happy with these after the return to form on Death Magnetic.  \\"Just A Bullet Away\\" seems very modern in terms of James' vocal delivery.  His rhythmic style seems out of place compared to the straight ahead style Metallica fans are accustomed to.  The guitar riff lead in also has more of a Pantera circa \\"Walk\\" vibe.  Then with \\"Hell And Back\\" you get a song that sounds like it belongs on the Black Album.  The same could be said for \\"Hate Train\\" whose opening calls to mind \\"Through The Never\\" from the Black Album.<br /><br />In the end I am conflicted about Beyond Magnetic.  I like all of the things in the comparisons I made above.  It's just not what I would have expected from candidate songs leftover from the Death Magnetic recordings.  I settled on four stars because it means \\"I like it\\" - which at the end of the day I do.  Hopefully this helps you get an idea of what this EP is like.  Whether or not that is what you are looking for is entirely up to you.  I'd love to hear what other people think.  Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments below.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I purchased the DVD  collection as a present.  This was an excellent price & shipping was quick, arrived in time for the holiday.  We have been enjoying this series.  The DVDs come in an attractive case, the DVDs are laid out in \\"folders.\\"  Great item, very satisfied.
B006ON41FC|4.0|Sometimes you need a good laugh and don't feel like thinking too hard.  This game cracks me up.  I got this app for free but I would say it's worth paying for as well.
B006ON41FC|4.0|Addicting, challenging, but fun. Great for all ages! Enjoy time spent playing this game. Challenging enough for all levels of players. Have fun!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love this app a lot better then expected because i gives you games that are to beat and some times easy game to beat love it love it with a passion
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Firstly, if you have not read this first book, I will not include any spoilers in my assessment.  If you are a fan of the Dystopian future genre i.e. Blade Runner, 1984, Logans Run, Rollerball (the one with James Caan, not the piece of garbage with LL cool J) than this should hold your attention.  Imagine taking the reality shows Survivor and the Bachelor and put them in a gladiator arena for the amusement of the sick twisted empire.  Our protaganist Katniss is a survivor, nothing special to look at very much just trying to figure out how to survive in an environemt were food is scarce and the totalitarian government treats you like a slave. Every year the government aka \\"capital\\" puts on a gladiatorial game called the \\"hunger games\\" in which one boy and one girl 12-18 is chosen from each of the 12 districts.  The book primarily focuses on our protaganist and how she makes some difficult choices about what it takes to survive in the arena.  For folks that are trying to make this like an alternative to Twilight, I scoff at you. There is very little in the first book to suggest a real love triangle.  I am also grateful that the author Ms. Collins doesn't do that horrible JK Rowling routine of inventing a problem then inventing a spell to defeat the problem (how she convinced a bunch of kids to read the same book 7 times is beyond my comprehension). Ms Collins only uses one such device in this book and it is during a moment when our protaganist is stuck up a tree without a paddle (I wont say more so as not to violate my no spoiler promise).  Although many of the tweens who have reviewed this book here and on youtube suggest that it is a blazing page turner; I found myself not in agreement. The action and intrigue is paced pretty evenly throughout the book; yet much of the time is spent basically camping in the wild (i.e. setting up camp, hunting for food, collecting water etc.).  Now since it is the \\"hunger games\\" I can sort of let all of that slide a little but thereare guite a few dead slow moments in the book even during the time in the arena.  A good read and I hope the next two books go deeper into the political intrigue and how our protaganist will attempt to take down the empire from within.
B000JMLDCS|1.0|This book exemplifies the art of arguing a position without a foundation:<br />Step 1: Quote a statement from a critic<br />Step 2: Attribute a made up meaning to that statement<br />Step 3: Contrive an argument against the false meaning to that statement that you attributed to it yourself<br />Step 4: Be called a genius by anyone looking for for a book that affirms their beliefs<br />Step 5: Go down in history as a pretentious antiintellectual with a penchant for the English language
B000B8QG0O|5.0|A good sequel is hard to come by. However, this was better than the first! You will not be disappointed with your purchase.
B005K17RU0|4.0|So far the forecast has been spot on. Easy to navigate through the different screens. Couldnt br happier with this app. Nice and simple.
B0040ZA2D6|4.0|So i honestly wasn't too sure what to expect from these guys. They honestly surprised me in a good way. The only reason i was hesitant to check them out is because people around me were so negative about them. Now i realize they only wrote them off because they were a boy band. Pretty foolish if you ask me , but whatever. They have such lovable songs. It's a breath of fresh air considering a lot of todays music is so vulgar. Whoever says they can't sing needs to hear them live.
B006ON41FC|5.0|fun addicting game. i couldn't stop playing it! awesome music as well  hes so cute too!!! I'm glad it was free today!
B000EYK4GW|5.0|So our old Dumbo DVD was too scratched to play anymore and we needed a replacement. We went for this and are extremely satisfied! A must have for Disney fans. It's not a 2 disc edition , but oh well. We rarely watched those anyways.
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|You have to play it and go for not only the elusive \\"Perfect\\" in the untimed part of the game, but also play the timed game to get MEGA points!  My boyfriend and I like to play it together (although sometimes we are working against each other!  Lol)
B005WLQQ4Q|5.0|At least in my opinion. They have so many cute songs on here! They did sample a few lyrics on their songs , but who cares? I've heard the songs they sampled before BTR and i love them just the same! They didn't steal they had permission obviously. They didn't even make covers because what they did isn't considered covering a song. It's more like an alternate version of a song. People who simply write bad reviews because they aren't into pop shouldn't even bother. BTR is more than just auto-tune. If people heard them live they would realize that. I like them not only for their looks , but their talent. Them being attractive is just a plus. ;]
0385342063|5.0|I must say I was worried about this book. I was not sure how a good novel can come out of losing a cell phone and how can you possibly find love that way? However I am happy to say thy  I am in love! As always Sophie has done it! I read it in one day! This is a funny, sweet and light read - like many of her others, and this one reminds me of Can You Keep a Secret? In that the characters are very similar and lovesble... that makes you keep on going without wanting to put it down! I would recommend this book to everyone! The only bad thing is when you finish reading, I felt like I needed more!
B004SVM7BW|3.0|I've enjoyed using this app for the most part; I have a ton of PDF documents and books downloaded onto my Kindle Fire so I use it quite frequently. However, since I need to annotate so often, I can think of a few lacking features that could be added. First, it'd be nice to have the progress bar and annotation tools stay onscreen without my having to tap the screen. Second, having icons for frequently used tools (e.g. draw oval) would save a lot of time and tapping. Finally, having the ability to delete highlights, underlines and crossouts would be amazing because sometimes I accidentally make a mark or decide something isn't noteworthy after all. Overall though, good app.
B001FZ0A72|5.0|Dead Can Dance create music of unique and haunting beauty. Drawing on various ancient and medieval music sources, and the result is timeless. Dark at times, but never depressing. The rhythms are hypnotic, and Gerrard's vocal is other-worldly. This is one of their best albums. Highest recommendation.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|I picked this disc up because I only had the Full Screen DVD. This is a film that needs to be Widescreen or Letterbox. The special features are fantastic. If you don't own this, get it. Hey, it's JAWS..one of the best films ever made. Period.
B004EPZ0AC|5.0|In a time when movies targeted to kids are completely inappropriate--and made so to entertain ADULTS at the expense of exposing children to entirely too much, it's refreshing to have a movie that is made for young kids. It's sweet. It's fun. It's appropriate for my 3 year old. Shrek is not. Even Disney movies are suspect.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome!!!!! I loved it I I I I I I I icing I I I I I I I I I I I icici I I I I ii love pie!!!!
B00499DRJO|1.0|I will admit that I deleted the book off my Kindle before finishing it.  I did read quite a bit of it though.  Don't waste your money.<br /><br />It's just too complicated and very, very structured.  To me, healing is a natural thing.  It doesn't need multiple procedures or elaborate steps that would be hard to remember.  It's also very \\"New Agey.\\"<br /><br />Save your money. Pray.  Use the One Command which is a very simple way to bypass limiting beliefs and go into theta states and ask for healing.  This is much more complex than it needs to be, and not all that well written either.<br /><br />Thanks.

B0052GACNM|5.0|I requested and received Duets II for Christmas.  I ordered more to send around the world after I heard it.  This is superb music and incredible singing by various performers.  I also own  Duets I.  It is even better than Duets II!  Buy both if you do not own any.  Gift both Duets I and Duets II together.  Tony Bennett and producers -- thank you for this incredible gift to the world.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|She talks about some of the songs before she sings it. That makes the whole performance that much more intimate, especially with her personality.  Concert video suppose to bring that in-concert experience into the living room. The director seems to have ADD and it shows in this presentation. He jumps from one camera to another during the performance. The cut scene works great if it is done right; that is the cut scene syncs with the emotions and energy of artist and audience. But each of his cut scene doesn't last more than 10 seconds, and it's all random scenes that do not sync with the song's rhythm. It is a visual interruption than anything else. But at the same time, it's a true testament of Adele's voice; which overpowers the visual interruption and brings you right back into the concert.  Despite the visual shortcoming mentioned above, watching this blu-ray on a HDTV (1080i)with 5.1 speaker system (DTS) is breathe taking. I highly recommend it, even if you already own her mp3 from the major online distributors like iTunes and Amazon Music. Those mp3 are compressed and can't do justice for Adele's voice.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I'm addicted to Lana Del Rey. Sure, I've read the articles complaining about her SNL performance but that doesn't change how good this album sounds.<br />It's different, full of hooks and just plain great to listen to.<br /><br />Besides, it's not like she's Ashley Simpson...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very good. good pass time. I love it. its a very good app I donor hate it. its really fun for kids

B0063IH60K|4.0|Fun game! Love playing this game. Addictive card game that I can play for an hour at a time! Graphics are great - clear and easy to see. If you like playing this game on you're computer then you will enjoy the game.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Everything u would expect from a solitare game plus more options! Highly recommend it! Love it! You won't be disappointed!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I LOVE this app!  I love all the translations,  I love that you can highlight,  bookmark, and share verses, and I love all the reading plans too! I also like that you can turn on audio to hear it as you're reading, or to use if you just aren't in the reading &quot;mood &quot; but want to get the Word! Did I mention I LOVE this app? lol!
0307949486|1.0|I wanted to like this book. I really did. However, it turned out to be one of the most boring, poorly written books I have ever read with an idiotic plot and unlikeable characters. I only made it to the end because I kept hoping for the \\"real story\\" to start - it just never happened. Besides I thought there has to be a reason why this book is so popular - unfortunately after having read it I still don't get it. It was an utter waste of time.
1451627289|1.0|The basic problem with this book is that it's too long. There was an easy fix to this problem by changing the date of the 'arrival' in the past to say 6-12 months before the eponymous date, which would mean he didn't have to fill in 5 years worth of drivel and backstory.  King also proceeds to set up character and plot hooks, such as the Yellow Card Man, which he then ignores for 3/4s of the book only to reappear at the end in some kind of Jumping The Shark motif.  Not sure if this is some kind of wet dream on the part of Stephen King - it seems that way - but it's self-indulgent, ponderous, overly-long, beautifully written, crap.
B006ON41FC|5.0|played for a while not a bad little game good time killer . keep up the good work dev..........blah blah blaj blah 20 20 20
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a very fun and entertaining game. It has a lot of classic games, but also some cool newer ones. Very fun, I recommend it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The indispensible app. I have this loaded on my Kindle Fire. I get to choose the translation from a large range of alternatives.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this everyday.. it is on every device I own.. I even love the Internet browser &quot;clipper&quot;. I never forget anything anymore!!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|At first I thought this was just going to be a tetris-like game but it's much more. Even the levels I had difficulty with were fun and I kept saying trying over and over just because I couldn't wait to see how creative the next one was going to be
B006ON41FC|5.0|Free on kindle? Amazing! Great graphics... cute character .. friendly to children young and old. Thank you very much for adding this to the game of the day!
B00000G3PA|5.0|I also own the original VCR version of this movie so I know what the original soundtrack sounded like. I've seen this done to other movies that have gone to DVD---often the soundtrack makes the movie and is very disappointing when it is changed upon being released under a new format.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game caught me after it began to get harder and now I wont put it down :) still trying to figure out what groceries go best where, but I really like it and recommend it.
B006ON41FC|5.0|more fun than owning a nut farm. I have thoroughly. enjoyed this app and it.was free. I love my Kindle Fire. just.keep these free apps coming.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|The quick wit of Puss and his sultry latin charisma comes across even in the animation.  Add the wit, ever so slightly adult humor, and his sexy relationship with Selma's character is just adorable.
B006ON41FC|4.0|I laughed the whole time I play this game. My kids also love it. It is kinds silly but that is what makes it fun.
B004EBT5CU|1.0|A 2-dimensional recording of a 3-dimensional artist.  It's Carnegie Hall ... the microphone is 1 inch from Adele ...  From 40 rows back ... after her voice had a chance to really open up ... this would have been ... just astonishing.  Instead the recording is BRIGHT and the sound stage is shallow.
B006ON41FC|2.0|The game itself is really cute, but it has an annoying social media ad on that you have no option of opting out of. I've already deleted the whole thing.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is great. It has been the most accurate. I have had a lot of different weather apps and this one is the best.
B004UBM4TA|5.0|The 3D effect is breathtaking, much better than what I saw at an IMAX 3D theater.  I was contemplating returning this 70\\" Sharp 3D TV (top of the line as of Feb 2012 excluding the $7000 Elite model) due to DSE (dirty screen effect) with 1080i materials (OTA, Cable). But this disc let me know what my TV is capable of displaying when the source is clean and top-notched.  DSE still present while watching this but very minimal.  This is a disc that I can use to show off my TV's 3D capability.  Highly recommend.  Storyline is a lil' on the lacking side but that's a plus cos' I couldn't focus on the plot any way with such picture-perfect 3D effect / distraction ...
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I will mirror most comments that the E6 is a fantastic device.  It is powerful enough to drive my Hi-FiMan HE-400's and add wonderful range and soundstage to my Shure SE-535's.  I really enjoy how much it adds to my music at a very reasonable price and diminutive size.  I would recommend this amp to ANYONE using ANY portable device as most devices have lackluster built-in amps.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This game is fun!  its awesome how it makes its own goals.  it keeps the game interesting!! so yeah I think you should definatly get this game well wroth the download
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great game. there are so.many of them. I Java had this game for a while and still have not finish it.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|There seems to be a trend with books nowadays that the style of prose makes the book great, not necessarily the story. This book is PURE STORY and if you have any nerd in you at all and know anything about the 80's, you must read this!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game has many games in one. This game keeps me challenged throughout it. I like how you can purchase more games with the points you earn.
B006ON41FC|4.0|It is a pretty good game. It's addictive and fun, but can be very frustrating when the goals get too hard.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|Don't get me wrong this game is fun and all and I like it as much as the next guy,but there are a couple problems like when my little sister finishes a level I'm SURE she or anyone else wants to see a zombie with bite marks all over his body,geeee doesn't that sound wonderful. another bone I have to pick I had like 4+ whole segments of games,know I have none ain't that just peachy
B006ON41FC|5.0|Great game to waste a little time here and there.  Easy to learn,  and the challenges are fun to play.
B006ON41FC|5.0|it is so fun you get to be flying in the air and get to get helments and get to be a wolnut and lots more.

B006ON41FC|4.0|Fun game. although takes some getting used to on the flight control. game controls could use a slight tweaking along with more nuts.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I got this game as the free app of the day and I love it.  Its fun and its all I ever play anymore!

B004O3YGMC|5.0|Very cool app.  Easy to configure communication between your Pc and your tablet.  Easy to use, especially if you use the \\"hand\\" pointer rather than the arrow.  Able to play web games that cannot be downloaded to your tablet and access your bookmarks that are set up on your Pc.  Well worth the $5 cost of the app.
0439023521|4.0|I've been aware of The Hunger Games for awhile, but I kept putting it off for a variety of reasons, one of which being I wasn't sure if I wanted to get myself into another YA dystopian series.  However, after I saw the trailers for the movie, it looked so amazing that I knew I wanted some experience with the material before seeing it.<br /><br />A theme that I enjoy in the new dystopian series' I've read over the past year or so is the necessity of having strong characters.  The future in these worlds sucks, someone has to do something about it, and I really appreciate when those people are female.  Katniss is a strong character who is used to fending for both herself and her family in an unfair world where she has no choice - they will all surely die without her efforts.<br /><br />This is in stark contrast to a lot of the YA paranormal books out there, where the heroine isn't strong about anything, and looks to the men in her life to keep her safe and taken care of.  If for no reason other than that, I think this book is more worthwhile than a lot of series openers.  That being said, this is a graphically violent book which made me cry a whole lot, so be prepared.  I haven't cried that much in a book since I read the last Harry Potter.<br /><br />While I very much enjoyed this book, I think it's super borderline when it comes to the young adult distinction.  It takes things a lot further than any YA books I've read in recent memory, and I would say only a mature kid should be reading it.  The Capitol's treatment of the citizens is extremely harsh and difficult to read about, so I highly recommend parental discussion throughout the book.  If you're a cautious parent, I would suggest reading it first before deciding if you are comfortable with your kids reading it.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love the variety of the game. The different levels prove to make you earn the stars to get to the next aisle. Additive and entertaining. Helps me pass time while my neighbors are beating each other.
B006PZBR8S|5.0|Man, Oh Man... is this movie ever a Robo-Smashing good time! I dragged my Wife with me to go to see this at the local theater last year...and she went with me, reluctantly, but she ended up enjoying it quite a bit, as did I. So when I found it on sale at my local Target store recently, I just couldn't help myself and had to pick up a copy.<br /><br />In the year 2020, Human boxing is replaced by robots duking it out in the ring instead. Well, we all know that is not going to happen. Of course Robot boxing WILL be a reality in the future, for sure. But I'm almost certain that Humans will still have boxing matches also.<br /><br />Anyway, Hugh Jackman stars as Charlie, a former boxer who now owns and operates an old beat-up robot boxer named Ambush, which he uses at county fairs and other small shows in battles with other robots to earn a living. He's pretty much a self-centered jerk who suddenly finds himself having to take care of his 11-year-old son, Max, who he abandoned years ago. The two go on robo-battle matches together, where the impatient knee-jerk reactive Charlie embarrasingly loses his latest robo-fighter, Noisy Boy, in a match against another robot named Midas. Noisy Boy gets pretty much trashed in it's losing battle with Midas, leaving Charlie robotless and in desperate need of money, and of course another robot. Later that evening on their way back home from the fight, Charlie and Max obtain an old, abandoned Robo-Boxing training robot named Atom, which they steal from a junkyard in the middle of a rainy night.<br /><br />Max and Charlie clean and polish Atom up, upgrade him, and train him with lots of fancy new moves, then enter him into underground boxing matches where Atom wins fight after fight, and eventually makes his way into an WRBC (World Robot Boxing Championship) match that is televised live on ESPN. Amazingly Atom wins the fight in an upset that has the crowd roaring with applause. After the match, Max makes an announcement live on TV where he challenges the top contending robot champ of all champs, The mighty Zeus, who is the latest in advanced robot boxing technology. Can Atom defeat the mighty Zeus and gain worldwide recognition as a worthy contender, and more importantly, does Charlie finally realize what a schmuck he's been, and become a better Father to his Son, Max?<br /><br />Well, you will just have to watch the movie to find out.<br /><br />Real Steel is a great heartwarming family movie that is loaded with lots of fun, action, and robot fighting scenes that will please the entire family and have them cheering by the movie's end. I give it two Robot Fists way up!ing robot champ of all champs, The mighty Zeus, who is the latest in advanced robot boxing technology.

1594203334|4.0|I found this book thoroughly enjoyable. Rather a how-to book or a bland parenting book, it's written more like a novel that follows the author on her journey as a mother raising her children in a foreign culture. While I was sometimes frustrated with the lack of practical \\"how-to\\" explanations of the various principles that the author lays out, the book is so well written (she's a former foreign correspondent for a major NY newspaper - perhaps the NY TImes? And it shows in the caliber of her writing) that I was willing to forgive this.  There were lots of little nuggets throughout the book that I tucked away for future use with my toddler (don't overpraise, give them firm boundaries but let them be free within them, require respectful behavior to adults), I found myself asking a lot \\"then what?\\" Perhaps it's all the brie and red wine that French women drink that breeds docile children but it sure seemed like the children never challenged any of these principles or rules. There was a frustrating lack of ideas on what to do when your child challenges these rules (or the \\"cadre\\" as its called in French). For example, the author tells a story of how her 10 month old daughter pulls all of the books off the bookshelf. Assuming this is normal, she jsut picks them up later. But her French friends say that she should rationally explain the proper behavior and simply expect compliance. Her friend visits and says to the baby, \\"We don't pull books. See, gently on the book shelf\\" and puts them back up. Her daughter not only helps put them away but doesn't pull them off again. Long before reading this book I'd tried that tactic with my 12-month old son. He looked at me, laughed and kept pulling the books off the shelf. Then what?  In another example, she relates \\"The Pause\\" - a principle where French parents allow a baby to cry or fuss for about 5-8 minutes before they tend to her, teaching hte baby to wait. This principle supposedly helps French babies self-soothe and they sleepthrough the night much earlier. Again, long before reading this book I was familiar with the concept of self-soothing and aimed to teach my infant son this skill. I did my version of \\"The Pause\\" for five or ten minutes before tending to him middle of the night, and by seven months he still wasn't sleeping through. He would have \\"Paused\\" until he was six years old if I let him. Then what?  But despite the lack of in depth step-by-step instructions, the book still was entertaining, refreshing, and enlightening. I particularly liked the focus on teaching children to be autonomous, respectful, and that parents should come first. That fits with my own mentality on the family. I was impressed by the description of how stylish and put together French mothers are (and a little intimidated) and jealous of the described daycare and preschool system  All in all, a good read! It's especially relevant if  you're the kind of parent who struggles with being the over-bearing, \\"helicopter\\" type and you want some encouragement that the whole world won't come crashing down if your child doesn't get his way or has to go to bed alone.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is super fun I just barely got it and do jot want to put it down I got it for free but worth the drollery for sure
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Totally a fun set of games. Very addictive. Love the games. I would highly recommend this app. I could play this all day.
B006ON41FC|4.0|I enjoy the game, but have had some issues with it freezing my phone and force closing. Fix that and it would be 5 stars.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game I really engoyed it was very addicting so I kept playing on it and the little squerl was very cute
B006ON41FC|5.0|very fun and addicting. I have had no problems at all with this game. I would highly recommend to anyone. Acer iconia and Samsung charge.
B005POK858|4.0|A great RPG if you had taken a liking of the old FFs. The graphics are 2D animation with a pretty amazing background during the fighting sequences. Storyline was pretty interesting IMO. It requires patience as a fair warning to people who dislike grinding and levelling. A word of advice to new players.... Make sure you save enough gold because you will definitely need it. Music is good but doesn't change so it's a tad repetitive. Overall it's a neat little game that makes you nostalgic for the 90's.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This game is very fun. It is great for everyone. You must stay committed to the game to like it
B006ON41FC|5.0|fun game pretty good a little bit of lag in the controls nothing you can't work with just have to get used to it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Perfect for kindle fire and works great on every device it supports. I would recommend this app for everyone especially college students
B006ON41FC|5.0|the game is so fun everybody try it. it has good graphics. the game is so addicting my fab animal is a squirrel. stupid drunk nuts, but its fun.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Game needs option menu for tilt control and sound. Other then that, game is fun, cute, appropriate for all ages and unique. I got for free but would pay for this app.
B006ON41FC|5.0|very fun game. good for killing time, and the achievements are pretty hard to complete. the bonus items rock, but are berry expensive.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|I loved this app until it suddenly stopped working. I can get to the main screen, but anytime I actually try to play the game (tap on a day in a given season) the program force-closes. Very upsetting! I think the problem is linked to the ad that runs upon opening the app... the ad for Angry Birds Space coming out in March. Only after this ad started popping up did the app begin force-closing. HTC EVO Shift 4G.
B002BWP49C|3.0|Well it was ok...although I was actually dreading watching the movie. Things go super fast and stuff from the 3rd book is put into this movie, I'm guessing since the stuff was left out of the 3rd movie... But anyway the wedding takes place outside instead of inside, her friends are there even though they weren't in the book, and yeah she craves his attention just way too much for my taste, and honestly as far as the book and the movie goes, I just don't think anyone's first time is that amazing...no matter how much they want their partner...anyway I'm guessing that this is a \\"must\\" for any die hard fan or collector...
B006PHD0RW|5.0|The game is fun and very cute. My son and I love to try and figure it out together! I have to admit though I also play when it is just me!
B006ON41FC|5.0|like j said, fun game on the kindle fire. didn't have any problems playing the game. my 7 year old loves it too!
B006ON41FC|5.0|loved it! practically addicted to this game. some of the goals are pretty difficult, though. still, can't stop playing! the squirrel is too cute.
B0063IH60K|4.0|i'm used to using free or inexpensive apps on an ipod touch. I noticed in a lot of cases the android versions for the kindle fire are sloppy. in some buttons are almost off screen. this solitaire app however works great.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I cannot help but compare this item to those available for the ipad. This one is easily as nice as those-if not nicer - and way less money. I love my kindle and wanted to protect it so this is the way to go. The case is well made and fits the kindle fire perfectly. It should last many years. Very happy with purchase.
0517548232|5.0|I've had several economics courses when I was in college, but none of them were able to communicate economic lessons in such a way.  The material presented in the book is little light on the theory portion of a lesson, but it is very good at communicating the real world why's and showing the need to look at the all of the effects of an economic policy not just want you want to see or is easily measurable.  I would recommend this to anyone that wants to understand a little more about economics or as a primer to anyone taking an economics course.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This cover is perfect and is exactly as described. It is light weight, protects my Kindle Fire well (unfortunately I know from first hand experience. My Fire was dropped and the case stayed shut and my Fire was fine.) It stands great too. I was skeptical on the stand but it does work.  I love this cover!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I found this movie very compelling. The tension is there throughout even in the laughing areas. The movie was well done and the actors were extremely believable and a joy to watch.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is tons of fun has a variety of games to play and for all ages. this is something I enjoy playing and on long car trip keeps My kids happy.
B0071QIN00|4.0|this game is really addicting, it can be hard and frustrating AMD some things need to be fixed,<br /><br />but the only thing that bugs me is that it ends after the last level! yes yes people will say &quot;yeah LAST level&quot; but I mean I was hoping for some alternate modes to be opened like time trial or PVP (reeeaally wanted pvp) maybe trial extreme 3<br />O_o
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game was a free app of the day and I got it and ive been addicted ever since and its very addicting warning
B00005JLKN|5.0|now I HAVE it was a good good good good movie to see just like the 3 of collector's AND IT COME IN WIDESCREEN
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Ever since the commercial for the new angry birds space, it won't let me play the game anymore. I'm very disappointed now. Update: it's fixed
B006ON41FC|4.0|A fun way to pass the day flying a squirrel through the trees. But watch out for the owls, bad nuts and the flying dynamite. Disable Open Feint.
0062082353|5.0|Chris Kyle is a hero and patriot.  American Sniper provides a revealing and personal account of Chris's time as a Navy Seal, and the mentality necessary to execute at a high level as a sniper.  An incredible front row seat, the reader sees through Chris's eyes and starts to understand the courage possessed and sacrifices made by the SEALs and our armed forces.  All proceeds go the families of his fallen team members.
B006ON41FC|3.0|Would be a much better game if it had &quot;lives,&quot; i.e., allow the player to continue &quot;flying&quot; from the same point 2 or 3 times instead of having to go all the way back to the beginning every time you hit a tree.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have this app on nh iphone, and I absolutely LOVE IT! The Kindle version is good too...when I can use it that is. There seems to always be a problem with the connection, which hinders me from being able to access things such as the different plans.  I was really excited to get this app, so my daughter and I can do various plans together and not have to share the tiny iphone screen. Now, we still have to share the screen because the connection almost never works. I don't know if it's the app or the kindle, but if it's the app then PLEASE FIX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THANKS!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great ui, and can't beat the content. Daily Inspiration, daily affirmations, daily dedication. The plans are great for setting goals and exploring the good book.
B006ON41FC|5.0|one of ttithe best games I ever played and I highly recommend it. I got it as the free app of the day but I would buy it if I had to
B006ON41FC|5.0|I loved this game its really addicting I got it on my kindle 15 min. ago and already have three outfits!
B006ON41FC|5.0|Go nuts has a great setup and game design and is a great time waster app. You can collect various nuts and speedup and is just a great app.
1594200653|5.0|[[ASIN:0143037757 Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945]]  This is a superb and very well told history of Europe after WWII.  The author knows his subject inside out and has organized an overwhelming amount of facts and data in such a way as to give the reader a clear and very informative account of that era.  Most interestingly, he also deals with countries that used to be behind the Iron Curtain, about which books on European history tended to be quite silent in the past.  I highly recommend this book.
B006ON41FC|5.0|AW- MAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm an 11 year old and i really think this is a really good app......i own a kindle fire and i play on it everyday..........I &lt;3 this app!!!! and to top it off, its for free!!!!!! its an amazing app and i think if u don't have this app, u haven't lived yet 8-) lol I'm just kidding but seriously u need to get this app i recommend it to people ages 0-16 yrs old 8-)
B006ON41FC|5.0|you get a bunch of upgrades on suits and gadgets plus you get a lot of different acorns it also has 3-D graphics
B006ON41FC|5.0|Could use more levels, though it is Just challenging enough to be lots of fun! Definately a must have as the 'FAOTD'!
B004CRR9G0|5.0|As a huge Miyazaki fan, I already had (almost) all of his films on DVD and finally decided it'd be worth doubling up on my copy of my personal favorite movie of his, Nausicaa, since it was getting done in Blu-Ray.  I cannot recommend it enough. Not only is the film brilliant, the blu-ray treatment really makes each frame completely artful and incredibly appealing to look at. Any still image taken from this version of the film could be easily be taken as a work of art.  If you enjoy Miyazaki's films, there is no question - you should pick this one up.
1846555221|5.0|Aside a nagging suspicion that the title 'Phantom' looses some of its meaning in translation (the actual story isn't particularly Phantomesque) this is definitely one of the more bad-ass titles around.<br /><br />I'm not familiar with earlier Harry Hole works, however Nesbo pens such a brilliant character I was just as attached as a die hard fan. Phantom is also free of annoying information dumps, Harry's past is explained seamlessly through the ongoing plot.<br /><br />The story revolves around the death of a 'Gusto' a local junkie that the cops don't care much for, but was friends with Harry's son (cue personal vendetta, against the entire drug trade of Olso City)<br /><br />Nesbo adopts an interesting P.O.V. and gives us Gusto's dying thoughts, along with Harry's real-time investigation and interestingly I found Gusto's brutal narrative one of the more compelling aspects of the story. Nesbo also skilfully dances around with the 3rd person perspective creating a dynamic narrative, where many authors would have only made a clumsy mess.<br /><br />Twists abound in this gritty, painful tale, so hold onto something as you chew your nails off experiencing one of must-read thrillers of 2012!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I am shocked that Amazon and Pop Cap have the audacity to ask for money in exchange for an app that simply fails. The longest time I have played without a crash is under a minute. This game would be great, but the quality control is abysmal.
B005EGXTHG|4.0|I loved the first book, it was brilliant!<br />But with &#34;Catching Fire&#34; I'm not sure how I feel about it, of course certain parts I liked more than others and the ending was great but the whole book was very different to &#34;The Hunger Games&#34;.<br />I realise thats to be expected but to be honest I was a little disapointed with the characters towards the end.<br />I recommend you read it still though, especially if you enjoyed the first book of the trilogy as much as I did.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I am in love with this app! It is so much fun and almost as addicting as temple run*! Trust me, you will love it as much as me....Its the best!  *Nothing is addicting as Temple Run. NOTHING.
B002BWP49C|1.0|The movie wasn't bad.  This is my favorite book in the series and I wad a little disappointed in the translation to the movie.  A lot... more than necessary was cut out.  But the reason I'm overly dissatisfied is there are no special features... the documentry was cool.. thewedding video was a good idea in theory And that was basically it.  This is the only twilight DVD without deleted scenes. Which perhaps is the boat disappointing considering what was cut out.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I did enjoy reading this book, but I am giving it three stars just because there were parts about this story that I disliked and I cant see myself wanting to read this book again. yet with that said I did manage to read this entire novel in a single day, which means I couldn't put it down. I would recommed it to those who love a good drama/romance title which I myself do not care too much for.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|A great blend of humor, tears, and rejoicing in this the 4th movie produced by the Kendrick Brothers.  I would highly recommended to men and their families.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|The cover is easy to install, it is very lightweight and easy to handle. I am definitely satisfied with the purchase.
B006ON41FC|5.0|the kids love this little flying squirrel! i do too, even though my steering skills are substandard. :) watch out for trees!
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this awesome game. It makes me feel like I'm in the game for real. I loooooove this game sooooo much.

B0063IH60K|5.0|great solitaire game with a choice of an auto win after you're bound to win. I play it everyday for hours.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Addicting game. Fun game to kill the time. No worries about it being openfeit games for it not giving your name out and can be disabled now.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Love this app! It is so much fun. The graphics are really cute. I would recommend it for a nice little time killer.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Thus is a great way for me to pass time, i love it! Its awesome! i give it a 5 star
B006ON41FC|1.0|Game keeps asking for a rating, so here is one star for you. Do not like the open feint issue but the game is alright.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app and it is very useful for many times you want to learn more about God. Hope people agree with me too!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|you should of made this a game before and everybody would play it.  I play it so I think more people are going to play it.
B001V9LPWQ|4.0|I expected some breathtaking special effects in the blu ray edition, but it failed to impress me. The story is classic, but somehow the sharpness of pictures/sound are not present. It felt no different from DVD or rather a VHS reel.
057809665X|5.0|This book is a well-researched and thoughtful guide on dealing with people we will encounter in our daily lives. I like the use of personal examples throughout the book as it makes the techniques easier to relate to. It is a quick and engaging read and I highly recommend it.

B005HJWWW8|5.0|I am V.i.P. The current Guinness World Record Holder for longest freestyle rap which lasted 12 hours straight on October 22nd 2010 in Abilene Texas. First off this amp shouldn't be considered an E6 because it's more like a 5 star general at a time of war baby. I love this little sucker. Plug it in any USB to charge and get hours of life for perfect accurate mixing with a setting for regular mid hi and lows. This lil guy is the rock that killed goliath. Goliath is the over pricing on mixing and mastering from Pro Studios. So I use this product every day while recording my first self titled Album V.i.P. $peed Kill$ Power Corrupt$ set to drop April 20th 2012 on iTunes. Well this lil guy is a must have for awesome mixing sessions with whatever DAW and sou card or mix board you may have.

B004ZQBP3Q|5.0|Music is upbeat and fun. I received CD in perfect condition. I recommend CD to anyone who wants to listen to fast paced party music.
B005QYKE2Y|2.0|A waist of time, money, and brain cells.  Do not waist your time with this pointless drivel.  This makes me hope they never make another attempt at a Transformers movie.
B00457WZEI|4.0|I enjoyed that the story was told from the perspective of the horse.  Easy read and a very touching story.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This Game Is Addictive And Fun!  And It Works Great For My Kindle Fire Also I Recommend Getting It If You Get Bored A lot.
B0078N2MTE|5.0|I was apprehensive at first when I first saw this title and as I read reviews and watched the trailer. My apprehension soon faded away. I fell in love with the movie, the acting is really great, though I don't know much about acting but this seemed awesome. This movie keeps you guessing the whole way and doesn't ever let up with the pyschological warfare that it fires at you.
B0058VW36U|5.0|this is a good game and once you start playing it you will get hooked and the little person is really cute
B004XWMXW4|5.0|I love this CD!  I bought the first one in Dec. of 2011 and loved it so much that I bought a second one in Jan. 2012.  I have one for my car stereo and the other one for my home stereo. I never get tired of it!  It has inspired me so much that at the ripe old age of 58, I have started violin lessons.  I had always wanted to, but for one reason or another was never able to take lessons. Then it became \\"I am to old to take lessons\\".  Well guess what?  It is not too late to take up a dream that you thought you could never achieve!  I love it! This CD started the ball rolling and it inspires me to keep on learning and enjoying!
B006ON41FC|5.0|this. is the best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I think its the best game ever I m going nuts about going nuts
B000JMKQX0|1.0|The author is terrible. I do agree with someone else, once I read about how artillery wouldn't hurt the zombies, I wanted to quit reading. The interview style is terrible after a while. Everyone interviewed speaks the same way as everyone else, and it's laughably pathetic. This guy basically is regurgitating his high school education in this book, instead of telling a story. It just doesn't work, and I gave up. Max Brooks needs to go back to writing school.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is fun because of all the games that you can play and earn points in and that why I think this is a fun game
B006ON41FC|5.0|Love this game, its super fun and challenging enough to keep you engaged. It runs pretty smoothly and has simple controls.
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a good app but I want jetpack joyride. I have played jetpack joyride and halfbrick has made that game but on apple products and it is the best game ever!!! Please halfbrick make that game on a kindle fire!!

B006ON41FC|5.0|I like the way this game is played I'll be nice if I could play at the same time with someone else. Yes, developers should make more games that can be played by more than one thru the internet at the same time.
B000063UR1|5.0|This is a movie I watched as a kid and never forgot. Its about something important involving the care of the life on this earth. You don't have to be a tree-hugger to figure out that sooner or later mankind will have ruined the earth. He is in the process of doing it right now. This is a story about how mankind finally got to the point where every living thing on earth became expendable when a dollar bill became involved. Bruce Dern played a man in the future who wasn't ready to see this happen. The movie is well worth watching. But in reference to our real planet earth and the final outcome portrayed in this DVD: God Jehovah will soon bring to ruin those ruining the earth and establish all the earth as a paradise. This is just as he willed it in the garden of Eden several thousand years ago. This would be after man had his chance to rule by himself apart from God. So watch this picture. You may like it.

B0058BIHXI|4.0|This is my favorite US comedy, along with Parks and Recreation.  The core cast and recurring roles have been wonderful.  I find it difficult to believe that the the writers ran out of material for the Leslie Winkle character...sounds like a cop-out.<br /><br />However, Pria was the shallowest, least interesting character they have ever juxtaposed to Penny, and had no chemistry with anyone, including Leonard.  I can't imagine what they were thinking?  She was a burden, rather than an addition to the cast, and I am happy and grateful that she was written out this season.<br /><br />Amy Farah Fowler (I even love her name!) and Bernadette, on the other hand, are wonderful characters, with depth, appeal, quirkiness to match the main characters and welcome additions to the cast.<br /><br />At this juncture, this is the only season I don't own, and while I will, eventually, I am waiting for the used DVDs to go down in price, where I purchased the other seasons streaming in HD.<br /><br />I'm glad they came back to their senses this year.

B006ON41FC|4.0|For everyone upset about Feint...you can opt out.  Just follow the instructions on the hint/news box.  The game itself is quite fun but does get repetitive.  Only the fun in collecting the achievements keeps it from getting rated lower.  Works fine on my KF.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Just like spider solitaire on the computer. Sometimes a bit laggy, but all in all a great time killer. I like having the hints and undo for when I get stuck.
B006ON41FC|1.0|I hate it and hope that submitting this will make the popup stop... but I highly doubt it will... I did however remove openfeint... just read the menu when you first start
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I have had a lot of fun with these games so far. I have unlocked a bunch, although there are some where i constantly fail.<br />These games are a lot of fun and very entertaining. I like some much more than others, but did not expect anything different with such a big collection.
B006ON41FC|4.0|20 word minimum? That, good people, is stupid. What's not stupid, though, is this game. Good use of humorous, addictive gameplay, and the all-important use of powerups and challenging challenges... this is a pretty fun time sink and a worthwhile way to get your boss really pissed at you.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Luv it! Replay deal &amp; hints are excellent features. I won't use winning deal; I always want challenge. Luv, luv, luv it
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|when I downloaded it in morning it worked great....but the following day they added the \\"space ad\\"...and it stopped working. I'm sure rovio is aware of the problem and will get it fixed or just remove the ad.
B004A8ZWWE|4.0|Real Steel has something for everyone. My wife doesn't typically like action movies but she loved this movie. It has great special effects, a solid cast, excellent script, and is appropriate for children IMO.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is probably the best Bible app out there. With the ability to change versions and the choices of devotionals, it is my favorite app
B006ON41FC|5.0|i don't see a prob with open feint and the game it self is real fun! g g g g
1433503794|5.0|Some things I wanted to know about this Bible but couldn't find out:  It's printed in the USA  It's the ESV 2011 text (some slight changes to less than 200 words vs the ESV 2007 text - google it to see the list)  It's heavy: it weighs 3 lbs 14 oz per my kitchen scale  I love the notes, articles, maps and the other features. I own a thin line version of this same bible with the same cover and it's held up to daily use for two years and looks like it will last for many more years to come.  Overall I would highly recommend this bible to anyone interested in a very detailed and comprehensive study bible.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Good time waster but it is hard to get enough points to move on to the next game. The game force closed on me twice already.
B000063DIR|1.0|This, like a LOT of other Amazon reviewers, is, was, and always will be my favorite solo Ozzy disc. I bought it when it first came out in 1982, and unlike \\"Blizzard Of Ozz\\", I loved EVERY track on the lp! I still do to this day. Matter of fact, I herald this a masterpiece of rock and roll. It was sure perfection, every single note -be it vocal, guitar, bass, drums, or lyrics- was perfect.<br /><br />As much as I like \\"Blizzard\\" (and, trust me, I LIKE \\"Blizzard\\"!), this disc just was the one that 'did it' for me as far as Ozzy goes. This disc, to me, was liken to Sabbath's \\"Sabotage\\" in a lot of ways, in that it was a very personal conceptial album by Ozzy, and a very dark one at that. I really couldn't pick a favorite track from this, for I love every one on it.<br /><br />Why one star? Well, it's because of the desecration of re-recording something w/ new musicians that should never have been tampered with to begin with. I, too, like a LOT of people, bought both, this & \\"Blizzard\\" on cd without knowing they had been 'remixed' until it was too late. This is utter blasphemy!<br /><br />And, if you notice, songwriting credits still include Daisley and Kerslake, so wouldn't that mean that the Osbournes would still have to pay some kind of royalties anyway? Songwriting credits???! So WHY mess with the music??!! For Sharon Osbourne to mess with something that didn't need \\"fixin\\" just shows what an ignorant controlling b**ch she is. Well, it can all boil down to one word: Greed.<br /><br />As for Sharon, she had the audacity to take Tony Iommi to court right after the original Black Sabbath reunited, and sued him for use of the Sabbath name, and the b**ch won...meaning that Iommi can never use the name unless Ozzy is involved.<br /><br />By the way, one reviewer on here had a GREAT idea: let Tony Iommi take the 1st 8 Sabbath albums and re-release them with a new vocalist. Ok, maybe not.<br /><br />Yes, these remixed versions of the 1st two Ozzy cd's are that bad!! And just when I thought it couldn`t get any worse, \\"Little Dolls\\" came on and I almost puked. I couldn't believe just how BAD they've made such a great drum intro sound. Uggghhh!<br /><br />By the way, I've noticed that a lot of reviewers are \\"shocked\\" that Ozzy could do this to Randy Rhoads' memory. And, I too have heard and/or read how much Ozzy loved Randy like a brother/best friend, etc, etc.<br /><br />It struck me kind of odd whenever I remember seeing Ozzy live that year (it was the very last show w/ Rhoads, he died the very next day), because I still remember hearing Ozzy @ some point in the concert announce that his guitarist was leaving the band after that gig. I've encountered other people over the years that were at that same show, and they also claim too have heard the same announcement.<br /><br />\\"Blizzard\\" and \\"Diary\\" were the only TRUE Ozzy Osbourne records released, and now Sharon, the wicked witch from who knows where has ruined those. Thanks a lot! Not!!ame on and I almost puked. I couldn't believe just how BAD they've made such a great drum intro sound. Uggghhh!

B006ON41FC|5.0|This is a really cool game. I never get bored of it because there are always goals u need 2 get. This game works great on my kindle fire! I totally recommend this game!
B0027DJ87O|4.0|I love acoustic albums and this one is no different. However the one major flaw I have this particular recording is in the echo and reverb throughout the album. I don't know if it was the location of the recording or maybe there was a new guy doing the mic setup or what, but the echo on two or three of the tracks here was so bad that it really took away from the enjoyment of listening. Again nothing wrong on Alanis's part as far as I figure, just a not so great production effort.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|this game is a great time passer and is great for all ages. its worth the money. buy it! :)
B0067LY4WG|4.0|Yes, I'll freely admit it: Along with being a fan of Gustav Mahler, Dmitri Shostakovich, Tony Bennett and Jack Sheldon (how's that for eclectic?), I've also been turned on to Leonard Cohen - the great Canadian alternative to Bob Dylan (sorry, not a fan). In his current 'late' state, Cohen's voice has become ever more baritone like. As a commentator on our society - and on life in general - Cohen strikes me as being somewhere between Dylan and Tom Waits. He has Dylan's eye for detail, but with a bit of Tom Wait's tongue-in-cheek sense of humor. Like all great dandies, he's a former 'great lover' who probably can't get away with any of the wild things he used to get away with (I hope I'm wrong about that). Leonard Cohen knows it, and knows how to express it in a poetic and dignified way. He's not just another old-age rocker trying to pretend that he's still 25 years old.  \\"Old Ideas\\" is definitely a seminal work. It's hard to imagine that Cohen will have many more albums after this one, if any. Like Shostakovich's 15th and final String Quartet, all of the songs are slow in tempo. In addition, only a couple of these new tunes build to any kind of climax. But Cohen's voice is deep, soft and close-up on the microphone. This superbly mixed CD is accompanied by only the sparsest instrumentation, along with the Webb Sisters providing the usual background vocals - vocals that make a great contrast to Cohen's continued groveling in the depths. But I what also notice this time out, is just how much there's a Southern, almost Gospel-like quality to many of Cohen's more recent songs. Even some of the background and solo instruments suggest that, such as the banjo. That tinge of southern spice does jive nicely with Cohen's deepest ruminations.  If you're already a fan of Leonard Cohen, I'm convinced that \\"Old Ideas\\" will grow on you with time. I certainly liked it more the second time through. Those who are not familiar with Cohen should probably sample this first, to see if theslow tempos and old-age ruminations strike a chord at all (no pun intended). Otherwise, start off with some earlier material first.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Nice game to relax with. Easy to learn yet each puzzle is unique to itself and challenging.  Definitely worth the price...looking forward to the next version.
B006ON41FC|2.0|it is a cute and kind of addicting game.  but the feint sucks.  it is constantly opening and settings obscure random goals for the game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is challenging.  however, it's very fun to play. there are multiple games to play so you don't have to play just one game.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I really like this game.....even though I may only be thirteen I know a good game when I see one....the goals on this game are amazing they keep the game exciting and keep me playing this is my favorite game ever and you should definitely get it.
B006ON41FC|3.0|Simple game. The controls were thought out fairly well. Gameplay is straightforward, but the low framerate  I'm getting just makes the whole thing seem clunky. This game should be running better on a dual core Tegra 2 device like my Toshiba Thrive. Besides, those graphics aren't even complex enough to constitute such lackluster performance. Now, I don't mind since it doesn't bother me and I have an OpenFeint account, but is forcing it REALLY necessary? Every other OpenFeint enabled game has an opt in/out feature on first run, there's no reason yours shouldn't too. But at least you're not forcing garbage as bad as EA Origin on us.
B006ZEEHQS|2.0|It obviously depends on your humor, but I found this movie had only a few laughs, most of which were in the previews.  It wasn't terribly engaging as the plot unfolded and the ending only confirmed my feeling throughout.  Wait for it to come out on cable and then wait until you have literally nothing else to do or watch.
B006ON41FC|4.0|a fun game but every time you try to play it it says &quot;rate me&quot; the open feint is stupid too.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game delivers on all fronts. There are several reasons to like this game, for starters if has a variety of levels to play and the game challenges you to replay them until near perfection. The fun graphics and grocery names help to create a fun environment to play in also. The different levels offer different objectives which creates great replayability. This has quickly become my favorite time passer on my kindle fire. You will not regret the 99 cent investment on this great little game.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Can't stop playing. Challenging but a lot of fun.  Squirrel seems a little funny looking... still one of the best free app of the day.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great game for all ages.  I love it on my kindle.  Playing on kindle as opposed to phone allows you to make more accurate shots.  Tons of well designed levels.  Its the original and i believe the best game of its type.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is totally awesome I love this game! everytime I play on my kindle fire I play this game!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|If you're a child of the 80s, or just enjoy 80s pop culture & early tech, I think you'll really enjoy this book. It took me back to times of hanging out in BBS chat rooms, and playing MUDs, and the general geekery of my teenage years. If you're a \\"gamer\\" of any kind (or used to be!), I think you'll find this fascinating.  Actually, even if you aren't a gamer, I think you'll enjoy this book... so read it, immediately. :)
B006ON41FC|5.0|I have a difficult time with these flying games but this one has really gotten me hooked. The controls work effortlessly and the speed is slow enough that I can finally complete a level. Glad I downloaded it and a good faod.
B005T87QCI|3.0|its really cool but it's a bit hard i cant beat  the first level. h b b n j j j h hj j Vj j g j I jh j j hvnh b . j u j
0545425115|5.0|I was not able to put this book down!  I read it in 2 days.  Can't wait to see the movie and  also read the other two books in this series.  I have recommended it to all my friends.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this game it doesn't force close on anything. It's so addicting any I love it. I already bought an outfit for it. It gives you more challenges to achieve it's super fun and a good thing to waste time on :D 12 year old
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like how you can chose winning deal. also you do not have to drag the cards. worth the time.
B00000373U|4.0|I just freaking love this guy and hate that I only recently procured his music.....wasted years.  Anyho', what I don't understand is that people absolutely love this album..... My first intro was \\"...Basement..\\" and then \\"figure 8\\".  I recently got this beloved CD and was taken by my lack of acceptance.  (Mind you, sometimes it takes me several listenings.)<br /><br />I guess that I like higher production and quality....not saying that this one is bad............. I got Figure 8 and it was defective.  The seller gave me full credit refund, because 3 songs wouldn't play.<br /><br />I just had to buy Figure 8 AGAIN tonight because i \\"NEEDED\\" to hear the unplayable songs that I've not heard.  I LOVE this CD.  My neighbor just heard E. Smith for the first time tonight (Figure 8) and was awestruck.  'nough-said????
B000JML90Y|1.0|ha! science? his arguments are EASILY refutable. he kills himself with his promises. ex. complexity of cell and missing link (lucy is a fraud) so if your looking for a good fantasy look no further. enjoy.
B006O5Y0SS|1.0|How could this possibly be nominated for an Oscar?  Paris is beautiful but the movie wasn't. Just classic Woody Allen.
0385344228|5.0|\\"Defending Jacob\\" and \\"Before I go to sleep\\" are the two best thrillers I have read in the last 3-4 years.  \\"Defending Jacob\\" deserves 5 full stars. You might not like the final, you might dispute some psychological aspects, but it is really a great legal and psychological thriller. The characters are credible and elaborated in depth. They won't vanish from your mind after one week (as it often happens): they will stay with you.  In my opinion, reviews disclosing plot and characters do not service future readers. It may be useful for them readers to know that it is  shocking and sad family drama. It won't cheer you up.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Doesn't work on Fire. Crashes everytime I try to open it! Sometimes will show first page for city but then crashes if you pick next option like 15 day forecast.
B006ON41FC|2.0|This game had a decent premise. Gather the acorns. The controls are not responsive though. If that's on purpose to make it more difficult then they've done exactly as they set out to do.
B006VA3ZT6|4.0|I love this show! The characters are likeable. The story is great. I was surprised when I realiized this was a PBS show.
B006ON41FC|3.0|pretty good, not amazing. anoying adds that pop up begging for ratings every time you run app. slow and laggy sometimes
B006ON41FC|5.0|I was delightfully surprised by this app! Simple left and right controls. Simple achievements, yet still challenging. Nice way to pass a little time.  Ill be keeping this one oj my device for sure.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Definitely was skeptical at first how fun this game could be, but was pleasantly surprised. Good variety of game modes and short but sweet levels make this a winner.
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|Fits perfect, stays clean, nice and light. Only frustration is the way it props up. Most kindle books don't flip horizontal so it doesn't do me much good.
B006ON41FC|5.0|well, the game is interesting and fun. weird but fun. you fly around collecting nuts, while avoidind obsticles. still a really fun game
B006ON41FC|5.0|When you start playing the game you can pause it and click on the openfeint icon and opt out of the service from there. It is on the latest news information on the opening screen telling you how to do this. The 5 stars are for the game itself though. I thought this was an excellent faotd!
B006ON41FC|1.0|ok sooo apps these days are such crap I gate this one its so frikin stupid woo I want to sing a song elavator bottoms and morning air peoples silence.makes me wana take the stairs if you were here wed laugh about there vacant stairs but right now my time is theirs see seems like there's someone who disapproves judge it like they know about me those who they got nothing else to do I don't care right now ur mine so you say don't u woody ur preety lil mind people throw rocks at things that shine and life makes.live look hard the stakes are high the waters rough but this live is ours.. omg that took forever don't own that song follow me on twitter @ karlee gardner1546
B006W0QOF2|5.0|If you love 80s movies and car flicks you can not go wrong with this movie.  The movie has well developed characters and plot.  Must see.
B006ON41FC|4.0|really enjoyed the different goals.  played great on the kindle fire.  like that it wasn't the same each and every time I had to start over.  and it also gave goals that were not to much to ask!
B006ON41FC|5.0|great game for the money it is only1.00$ so its cheap and its very fun buy it it works great with the kindle I have recommended to all my friends and they all love it too so I am saying you should get it and have fun just collect the nuts
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app is an easy way to carry my Bible with me werever I go if I forget my Bible I always have this
B006ON41FC|2.0|anyone could come up with the idea for the game but I under stand it is hard to make a tablet game.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I don't what people r talking about I haven't had any trouble with this game fun I love it. I recommend. it for any age and it gives u free points even if u don't win a game I would get for free but not if u have to pay;)
0802473156|5.0|My son and his new wife received this book as a wedding present and shared with me how much they loved it.  They read it together, discovered their own love language, and found it to be quite enlightening.  I bought the book for myself and for another couple I love.  We both found it to be inspiring and helpful.  Read it together or by your self.  It really is a very helpful book if you want to show how much you love someone.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I bought this last year when I was browsing for a new read on my Kindle and thought it sounded interesting. This was before I had heard anything about it being made into a movie or how popular it had become. I love it so much I'm reading the series for the second time and it's even better now. I'm a fan of science fiction that isn't too far-fetched and could imagine this happening. It's been awhile since I've run across something that I liked well enough to read again but this is that work. Let the games begin!!!
B000GCFY0I|5.0|recently read the hunger games. i almost think this is as good if not better. hope they make a movie!
B004EPZ08E|1.0|I just wanted to add my comment of DISGUST at the SO called ULTRAVIOLET Digital copy that is advertised with many Blu ray Disc's now.  I have a number of Blu ray's that are advertised to come bundled with an Ultraviolet Digital copy of the movie to watch on a computer/portable device.  Well I have not be able to even get to the stage of trying to download as when I try and goto the web site shown on the download instructions, nothing comes up at all.  With iTunes digital copies it's mostly been a straight forward process, although Warner Bros iTunes Digital copies have come up with error's in the redemption code and I REALLY don't like that all the movie studios still advertise a digital copy when they have an expiry date and after that date you may not be able to download the digital copy to iTunes. The best system I feel is at Universal Studios through iTunes, they seem to have it together the best.  What amazes me is that both the majority of Movie studios and Record Companies have bitched non stop about people pirating movies/music and yet they appear to be completely unable to come up with an effective way to distribute digital content the way people want it.  Incredible that such talented people appear to do nothing other than drive customers away.  Check out Apple you guys and perhaps one day the penny will drop that you NEED TO MAKE THINGS FAIR AND STRAIGHTFORWARD for the consumer. Particularly at WB's you guys seem experts at upsetting consumers!!!  Pretty well much everyone will play ball when the rules respect the consumer!!!!  WAKE UP!!!

3899552512|5.0|Papercraft is a stunning book full of sharp and witty creations from a humble material. I've shared it with my students and Maine College of Art for a current 3D project, and they have found much inspiration.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This is a great game and realistic on how to bag. I used to bag at a grocery store for five years and this brings back good memories. Cute grocery items too!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I love it and it is optimized for Kindle Fire. when I type its displayed in big letters so I can clearly read it. I tried other apps to type and the text was so small that I quit using them. I also love how easy it is to view powerpoints.
B0038JN6VA|4.0|I must admitt that I was a little skeptical about this, but very pleased with the sound quality for the price. Very handy to play my phone or iPad through when I'm outside. I've been getting 8+ hours on a charge, but I'm not blasting it at full power, I'm sure. Not overly impressed with the included earbuds, but they sound ok, just not a comfortable fit for me.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This game is so fun, easy, and addicting. You will probably love this app, I know I do. So in conclusion this game rocks.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|a decent app I would maybe recommend it it is fun but some are hard and keeps it more interesting
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell gives you a chance to exercise your brain and keep it sharp.  The setting has a very calming effect, a nice departure from the frenzied atmosphere of many games.
B006UG90RM|4.0|Well you by now know or have heard how strong this CD is. They have tapped the proverbial fountain of youth with all the fire and flash of the old days with a BIG, in your face modern production sound that sounds so good, you will not miss the reverb drenched days of old. So since you've heard it all already, I'll just give my .02c on the tracks...  1. Tattoo - This to me sounded what I WOULD have expected the whole album to be like, then you get to the rest of the CD... A slower, matured pop/rock tune with a catchy vocal harmonized chorus. Not bad, but the most different sounding amongst all the tracks 3.5/5  2. She's the Woman - Now we're talkin'...riff driven killer rock, instant nostalgia. I love the bridge section at 2:03 for a cool contrast to the pile driving main riff. 4/5  3. You and Your Blues - Nice slow build and you have to love DLR's cool references to past rock hits. I love the 'four on the floor' drum beats that kick in at about 2:00. 4/5  4. Chinatown - More fierce guitar/bass/drumm riffing here with a spine tingling , ripping guitar solo from Ed that is total old school cool from the opening wild whammying and am I hearing the BASS in tandem with the outro guitar solo??? wow. 4/5  5. Blood and Fire - Super catchy tune, cleanish guitar parts remind me of Little guitars or Secrets. Roth giving it his all belting out the choruses. Another vintage solo from Ed. A favorite.  5/5  6. Bullethead - Spit and vinegar badness from the whole band. Love Eddie's fills on this one. Not particularly as catchy as the rest, but only because everything else is so strong. 3/5  7. As Is - Wow, this is different, Alex drums sounds huge and Eddie's playing opens in a dropped tuning that sounds even lower than drop D! Then the band kicks in at a furious pace with a killer Ed riff. Props to David Lee Roth for coming up with lyrics that keep up with the pace of the song. Love the breakdown at 2:40 and DLR 'Love 'em all I say, let Cupid sort 'em out'. 4/5  8. Honeybabysweetiedoll - Wild noise intro leads to a very heavy sounding riff and Eddie screaming some harmonics. May be the darkest and heaviest thing I've ever heard from the band. 3.5/5  9. The Trouble With Never - A classic sounding chorus on this one, with a 2012 version of Jimi Hendrix for the wah tinged verse riff. DLR sounds like he had to squeeze in some of the lyrics to fit the timing. Another cool breakdown (this album is FULL of these!) at 2:17 and DLR speaking the lyrics low and cool. Good stuff. 4/5  10. Outta Space - The verse sections are classic sounding VH1 or 2, but the chorus is new sounding. Another vintage killer solo from Eddie. And did you EVER imagine you'd hear DLR throwing out a reference to his facebook page! Not particularly hooky but still cool. 3/5  11. Stay Frosty - If I had to pick a single #1 favorite, this is it. Wow. Just killer from beginning to end. Starts out with an Ice Cream Man bluesy acoustic guitar and DLR with some BRILLIANT vocal phrasing, total vintage VH. Then at 1:12 the back kicks in with a HUGE, in your face sound , Eddie's guitar just killer sounding and the rhythym section of Alex and Wolfgang locked in perfectly. All the swagger and awesomeness of the old days. 5/5  12. Big River - And from the previous tunes badness, it doesn't stop, Big River stomps in with more classic Van Halenisms. Not my favorite breakdown in this one, but another scorcher solo from Ed. 4/5  13. Beats Workin' - And to cap it , Beats Workin' big bad riffing from Eddie and a catchy chorus. Slightly anti-climatic after Stay Frosty and Big River but the hanging ending note from Eddie caps it all. 3.5.5  So there you have it, a return to glory if ever there was one and as much as I like Chickenfoot too, this album just 1 ups their two records in every possible way.
B0078JRFZE|5.0|I never thought I would admit it, but I am hooked on Downton Abbey.  I watch each episode several times looking for little nuances that I might have missed.  The acting is superb, the scenery and costumes are a visual delight and the story lines keep me coming back for more and more.  Lord Robert's dog looks exactly like my own yellow Lab.  As a longtime horse lover and owner, the hunt scenes and the carriage horses are of special interest.  The automobiles, especially the 1911 Renault 16HP owned by the family, are fabulous.  I am so happy that this series will continue into a third season with the addition of Shirley McClain as Lady Cora's mother.  It will be a hoot when Shirley and Maggie Smith lock horns!  I also admit that the story lines are a bit unrealistic but heck, that's what makes it so interesting!
B0063GORYU|5.0|works great. fun game. i have absolutely no complaints. I would recommend it to anyone. try it out and enjoy!
B005ZUR724|3.0|I love this game when it works, but every time it updates, I have to redownload the whole game (which takes over an hour). Expect not to be able to play for a week every one to two months when they update. This past time, only low level players could log on, and they downgraded from xd to crappy graphics.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Most of the 3rd party controllers require you to use a USB adapter, which is annoying since I only have 2 ports and they are used by Guitar Hero controllers.  This is the real-deal and it works flawlessly.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|tons of fun,I had a hard time putting it down.I did however finish it in a day.not that I got anything else done.
B004CRR9G0|5.0|Disney has done an excellent job with their dubs of Miyazaki / Studio Ghibli movies.  These movies are also great \\"starter drugs\\" for converting people to anime ;)  I just wish they would bring out the BluRay releases...  Panyo was released on both, but the older ones are DVD-only.  I don't want to have to rebuy everything, so I actually haven't bought the more recent movies (Howls Moving Castle, Tales from Earthsea) because I'm waiting for BluRay.  I own almost all of the rest - purchased before BluRay existed - and will upgrade to BluRay as soon as they're available.  Come on Disney - how much work is it really to do this?  Stop dragging your feet just because you can...
B006PHD0RW|5.0|It's a great concept of Tetris, taking weight into account. Each grocery item looks like a character. Their emotions as to how they are placed in the bag give my kids a good idea of how to move them around. My kids are 4 and 5 years old. A test of a good game is how long they play, how seldom they have to ask me for help, no ads, no bugs (crashing/too long to load), and lots of smiles/laughter. A+ in my book!
B006ON41FC|4.0|This game proved quickly addictive. It gives you progressive targets as you build experience.  filler filler filler filler filler filler
B006ON41FC|4.0|this game is addicting and fun. controls are sticky sometimes and some of the challenges are too challenging but I would reccomend this game overall.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I'm down right addicted. I use this app for everything. Great interface between my desktop and mobile devices.  You definitely want the chrome plug in too.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|you only start with a few games that are easy to beat, and then you have to play them over and over to unlock new new games. but once you start to unlock them it becomes very addictive.
B006ON41FC|4.0|It's a fun game but it has its moments where it force closes a lot. But other than that, its pretty good.
B006ON41FC|5.0|cool this game is so awesome if you guys love cute stuff and having fun than you will love this game
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is fun for the most part except when there is a game that is too hard and you can not pass it
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is easy yet difficult. it has twists and turns until u end up hitting a tree with the animal.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are fun and really addicting.  once you beat one you cant wait for the next. some are difficult and it keeps it interesting.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this little game is fun when u try to get the little nut and try not to bump in to the tree's
B0054JZC6E|4.0|with all the different games to choose from it's a fun way to pass the time. some are easy, some are a little more challenging, but I'm sure for novices these would be easy.
1741048303|1.0|Once upon a time, Lonely Planet told you all you needed to know.  Not any more.  This guide is inept, sketchy and often just plain wrong.  It may say, \\"This is the centre of town with a charming avenue of restaurants a minute's walk away.\\"  Book a hotel there and you will discover that it is 5 kilometres away from anything at all and that the \\"avenue of restaurants\\" is actually a two lane highway lined with commercial buildings.  Like I say, more hindrance than help.  I would have been better off winging it.  Many times I actually wanted to throw this book against the wall.  It failed to mention that the best way of getting around Bali is Perama, the local bus company, and that the local Perama station is the best place to book tours and get information.  A pretty big omission, if you ask me.  Neither is there any discussion of the best way to access the internet and mobile phone network if you are on a budget (for those who need to know, I discovered (with zero help from Lonely Planet) that you should buy a dongle and Indonesian Sim for no more than Rs20,000 from the mobile phone shops with the yellow fronts).  My guess is that this guide has not been seriously updated any time since the internet revolution.  Which might explain why the lovely avenue of restaurants has now become a double lane highway - it's 20 years since a Lonely Planet writer went there.  Treat anything you read in this guide with extreme skepticism.<br /><br />\\"Get the Rough Guide, not the Lonely Planet.\\"  This is the advice I read most often nowadays.  It seems that Lonely Planet simply shift stuff around in their new editions (deleting a lot that was useful) without improving anything, instead letting their famous name do the selling. The focus seems to have shifted from budget travelling to high end tourists - yet I fail to see how rich tourists on package tours, staying in expensive hotels and hiring drivers, require a guide book to get them through a country.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game helps to kill short bouts of time.  lots of choices, can be addicting.  easy to play once you figure out how to move
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is one off the best game apps I've ever played. I am very happy with this app and it was free!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is great when your waiting for the next change of events to happen and for some reason there is a time lasp
B006ON41FC|5.0|when i first bought this app i was stuck on it for 6 hours straight. it is so addicting .
B004LWZW4M|4.0|I enjoyed a lot of things about this film. There were lots of films made since the original Planet of the Apes ('68, directed by Franklin J Schaffner, before he won the Oscar for Patton). I never saw any of the others. \\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\" has little to do with the others, though it could be considered a prequel. James Franco is likeable, always, and the rest of the cast is in tune with the proceedings. John Lithgow is especially endearing, and Andy Serkis proves, once again, that he's the best \\"artificial\\" actor around. A commendable performance.<br /><br />I admire the film for outstanding visual effects, and some brilliant photography featuring vistas of San Francisco (and Redwood NP) that are breathtaking. Muted colors and close-ups are stunning.<br /><br />Worth a look, but it's hard to say that it would be appreciated as much without seeing Schaffner's original, a true ground-breaker in American film.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This is an amazing app. You try over and over to earn achievements and get acorns to buy outfits and gear. My favorite is the Hot Rod outfit. A truly amazing game!
B006ON41FC|5.0|dis game is da best game I eva playd!!!!!!!!! I luv u it!!!!!!!:) I hope more games cum out lik dis's!!!!!!!!!:)
B0058RCVYS|5.0|Superb editing style, massive contrast between dynamic characters and an absolute must see. I am really inspired by the filmmakers and overall the film really teaches you what unconditional love looks like in a material world. Loved it.
B006ON41FC|3.0|This game is fun at first then gets a little repetitive.  However, I do like the items that you can buy with the points that you earn during the game. For example the outfits for the little guy ate cute.
1400049628|5.0|good quick read fun you will be stoking up for the next three months nice short read  Tzar Lonza Of Kendrick
B002BWP49M|1.0|Disc didnt read....my blu ray player sounded liked it wanted to eat it and spit it out for hummus...nice gift for valentines days amazon...right on point...
B006ON41FC|5.0|Fun addictive game with decent graphics. If you wanna get all the achievements you gotta play it for a while,  otherwise becomes boring. Nevertheless, best game for a quickie.
B000H5TVJY|5.0|5 Stars = Masterpiece<br /><br />Superior black comedy on the serial killer genre!<br /><br />Christian Bale is superbly, darkly comedic, as the narcissistic corporate ladder climbing executive, moonlighting as a serial killer by night. Hilarious scenes abound in this twisted black comedy, that has a ambiguous ending, which all I will say is, that it throws you a screwball, literally!<br /><br />Beware of falling chainsaws down high rises stairways!
B0067LY4WG|5.0|Leonard Cohen belongs to that rare category of artists who never stop growing and never get old with age.  Duke Ellington, Bob Dylan, Ludwig van Beethoven, Miles Davis, Aaron Copland, Wynton Marsalis, Merle Haggard, and Neil Young come to mind immediately as others belonging to this select group.  Contrary to the title of the album, this collection of songs is as original and creative as anything Cohen has done during his amazing life.  If you are new to Leonard Cohen, this is a good place to start learning about his intellectual artistry.  If you are familiar with him, what's keeping you from getting this?
B0063GORYU|5.0|Everything fits on the kindle fire screen.  Wish it would tell me when I have no moves left without me asking for help. Otherwise, just like the pc version.
0515149489|5.0|I purchased \\"The Search\\" to read while away on vacation!  As usual, I could not put the book down, from the moment I started while on the plane til the first day we were on the beach!  I have read Nora Roberts for many years, and she is forever capturing interest from page 1!  This story provides all the romance and excitement you could ask for, plus instilling appreciation for search and rescue dogs and their trainers, even if you are not a \\"dog person.\\"
B006ON41FC|4.0|can help waste time but will run down the battery because the screen is on.  good way to keep kids distracted
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great game when you have a lot of time. You just don't want to quit. So get comfy and have fun.
1451627289|5.0|The facts surrounding the historical event were extensively researched, then woven into a very interesting story. It was easy to identify with the characters, and every time I put the book down I would soon have to pick it up again to see what was happening. Particularly interesting was that things we take for granted today are big problems, when taken to a time when they did not exist.  Whether you are a Stephen King fan or not, you will not be disappointed.
B006ON41FC|4.0|fun to play.  i wish there were check point so that u dont have to start at the beginning every time.  the fast forward option helps
B006ZDU7QI|5.0|I bought this for the singles Somebody I Used to Know and Easy Way Out. Those songs are great, but I was pleased when I found that the rest of the disc is an absolute treasure. In fact, I think every track is fantastic, save for perhaps the brief opener. I'm shocked at how good each song is, and equally shocked to read a review on here that says something along the lines of each song sounding the same. I don't think that could be further from the truth! Gotye skips genres or at least influences from one song to the next. Easy Way Out reminds me of a Beck jam, Somebody that I Used to Know could be any one of a great many songwriters. The lyrics are pure and honest, production is sparse at first... and grows as the song progresses with a powerhouse vocal performance on the choruses. Equally powerful vocals on the next track, Eyes Wide Open, which reminds me possibly of Bryan Ferry/Roxy Music. The next, Smoke & Mirrors, is admittedly my probably least favorite on the disc, but is still worth a listen. The next two tracks take a very positive and upbeat turn. I Feel Better sounds like Motown at it's best/happiest with it's synthesized horns and vocals in the vein of Smokey Robinson. In Your Light is equally ebullient with horns and a lively vocal and peppy keyboards. After that, State of the Art is a hilarious track with astounding production that reminds me of Ween's very best work. The next (Don't Worry... We'll Be Watching) is a spare electronica track with a gorgeous creeping bassline and foggy electric sounds behind. The last 3 tracks all have a beautiful melancholy to them but all have their own flow. The closer Bronte is a beautifully emotional piece indicative of what Gotye seems best at - taking a somewhat simple or typical subject and creating a gorgeous piece of music out of. He takes the simplest, most basic building blocks of a song and places them at the core of the music, weaving simply effective layers around those. This disc is an example of mastering that craft. It's the best record I think I've heard in the last year or more. Truly a great piece of work. Listen to it with headphones and pay attention. You will be greatly rewarded.
B006ON41FC|5.0|love the game going nuts. had soo much fun playing it. love the goals. it is very addicting. need more games like it
B004JK61K0|5.0|BRAVO! and Kudos to folk who put this together. So simple and a pleasure to use.<br /><br />Who knew, simplicity and easy on the eye is why this works. Get it You will LOVE it.<br /><br />You a POWER USER, prob not so much for you....But maybe...Check it out.
B006ON41FC|5.0|love this game I cant stop playing it. it is very addictive... I love love love love it... a must have game..
B00005AQE8|3.0|I'm a big fan of 2pac, so I don't want the three stars to seem like a negative review. This is a good album, and 2pac definitely brings it: gritty lyrics, passion, great beats, quite a bit of rage.  However, as a double album there is a lot of filler, and when I play either disk in my car, I find that I can't listen to it over and over they way I can with Me Against the World.  There are some very good songs throughout, starting from the get go with \\"Ambitionz as a Ridah\\", and \\"Only God Can Judge Me\\" is a masterpiece. Being a double album unfortunately inflates the price, but I still think it's worth buying. Just keep your stereo close when you listen to it, because you'll likely be using that skip button quite a bit.
B006ON41FC|5.0|the sound track is fantastic and the game itself is fun. my son also enjoyed playing. a great time killer.
B004ETVAH0|5.0|I got the video and was so happy with the program that I wanted to have the music on my iPod. I was disappointed that all the songs that were in the video were not on the CD but I know that rights to all the music can be a problem. This is a tribute to Les Paul and Jeff Beck is amazing and the band excellent. It was fun to rediscover this great music. I recommend the Video and this CD as well.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this is an ok game.  not exactly what I thought it would be.  try it if you have a lot of free time
B006ON41FC|2.0|nuts, trees, flying and crazy animal could make this game interesting. Unfortunately the music starts to be intrusive after few games. Also &quot;full opt in&quot; to open fein withouth asking is very intrusive. Actually, its a road to disaster, as proved by many reviews in this log. At the end I have to state that game has been crashing on my Kindle fire. Consequently I just deleted it. RIP. Two stars rating is due to the &quot;potential&quot; this game has.
1439297517|5.0|Great for great and granddaughters! I have several and they're all reading or planning to read both of these books.
B0073LJ61S|5.0|I must admit it's been a long time since I listened to my Van Halen albums.  But once I listened to this new one, I realized what is missing from music today...it's Eddie!!  You just don't hear a guitar played like he plays his around anywhere.  When I listened to this album I remembered that.  The only complaint I have with this album is that I want there to be more songs!!
B004GYY714|5.0|I can't believe I can pick up this many radio stations on my Kindle. It is crystal clear. I have so many choices and can save them.
B006ON41FC|5.0|great game to pass the time!!  highly reccomend. picked it up as a free game, and have had a blast playing!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app performs as expected. it runs in the background without draining my battery and the forecasts are accurate.<br /><br />Kindle Fire
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Its a good game to have if your bored a lot which I am so works perfect for my brother and I.
0060558121|3.0|This is a very well written book as I am sure many would agree. And the premise of this book is absolutely brilliant, and very relevant to our current times. However, the execution was very difficult for me personally, to grasp.<br /><br />The main concept of the novel is that gods and mythological creatures, in general, exist because people believe in them. Immigrants to the US brought with them all sorts of creatures (or Gods, if you will). You had the dwarves, elves, leprechauns, the jin and many other spirits and gods. However, it seems that in present-day America, the power of these mythological beings has diminished greatly as people's beliefs wane. These Gods, referred to as the 'Old Gods', are starting to disappear, or more like they are being forgotten, as new gods take their place.<br /><br />Those new gods are a reflection of America's obsessions with media, celebrity, technology, internet, among others - so you have the God of Media, the God of Radio, the God of Television, the God of Internet etc.<br /><br />The 'Old Gods' led by Odin (the All-Father) want to participate in an epic battle against the New Gods hoping to restore their standing.<br /><br />The story revolves around a central character, Shadow, who is just released from prison to find that his wife had died in a tragic car accident with his best friend Robbie, and that she had been cheating on him with said friend. He is then approached by a mysterious man who goes by the name of Mr. Wednesday. Wednesday offers Shadow a job of becoming his protector - or bodyguard - but is not allowed to ask questions throughout their journey. And so begins Shadow's trek across the United States as he meets Wednesday's bizarre acquaintances and all the different creatures and Gods.<br /><br />As mentioned, the basis of the story is exceptional, but unfortunately, I just felt like the story went on for far too long. The events taking place were very slow, it took me a while to understand what was happening, or why it was happening. There was so much going on all at the same time. It's impressive the way Neil Gaiman managed to put it all together, but it did not attract me as a reader. It honestly took me so long to finish this book, and once I put it down, all I felt was relief that it was finally over.<br /><br />My favourite part of the entire story was the Introductory Note by Neil Gaiman, as I had bought the 10th Anniversary Edition. At one point he writes that the reception this book got were of two extremes: you either loved it, or hated it.<br /><br />Well, I suppose I'm here to tip the balance, as I neither loved it nor hated it. I liked it well enough.n all at the same time. It's impressive the way Neil Gaiman managed to put it all together, but it did not attract me as a reader.

B00466HNHM|4.0|2012 showed to be a year of celebration, and joy for Whitney Houston. But instead of celebrating 2 massive anniversaries for Whitney, including the 25th anniversary of her becoming the first songstress to have a album debut at #1 on Billboard and the 20th anniversary of The Bodyguard, and her work in the upcoming remake of Sparkle, we are dealing and reeling with the horrific and deviating loss of her life. Her songs and voice have always been some of the most intimate and soulful sonnets I have ever heard during the most trying to times. The Bodyguard is no exception with her first starring movie role with Kevin Costner. The film has been a instant classic for her fans and family. Hard to believe a role that was originally made for Diana Ross and cancelled in the 70's, became Whitney's acting opus in 1992, and still is just as strong as her voice. Now with the movie coming to Blu-Ray, we still celebrate this movie masterpiece for in Whitney's loving memory, and the joy her songs have brought us during the hardest of times.<br /><br />The Bodyguard remains a classic and Whitney's chemistry with Kevin Costner is classic. The story honestly focuses on Rachel Marron, a star-celebrated actress and celebrity whom is stalked and is a target for murder. The chemistry that is there as a diva whom is known for her music and spirit the world over, deals with celebrating her life and a dash of tempermental ego, but finds love in the most strangest of ways with falling in love with the bodyguard hired to protect her Frank, played by Kevin. The chemistry in music and movies is definitively strong here in each and every turn from not just Whitney alone with her songs like I Have Nothing, the beautiful Run To You and of course the definitive I Will Always Love You, but also from others like Joe Cocker with Trust In Me to name a few. The chemistry and love in the film is absolutely amazing, and tugs at the deepest of heartstrings, in heart, soul and especially in spirit. The extras here also show including the definitive video for I Will Always Love You, where Whitney is sitting down, while pregnant with her baby Bobbi Kristina, just singing her heart out. The movie is just as bold today, as it was when it originally came out 20 years ago.<br /><br />Overall, if you are new to Whitney Houston's music and movies, because of the sadness of having to say goodbye to her in death, we will always have a moment to celebrate her life and how she touched us in heart, soul and especially in spirits all over the world. The Bodyguard is a everlasting masterpiece from start to finish, and still shows why she was so talented from every angle in life. I absolutely recommend The Bodyguard for your movie library.<br /><br />Whitney Houston 1963-2012 Whitney, We will always love you no matter what.<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Remastering: B+<br /><br />Story: B+<br /><br />Extras: C+<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2+show including the definitive video for I Will Always Love You, where Whitney is sitting down, while pregnant with her baby Bobbi Kristina, just singing her heart out.

B0055SWM08|5.0|this is the best challenging game I have ever played. it is good for people who like to be challenged.
B006UG90RM|4.0|Unlike the kowtowing sycophants out there it is not a 5 star CD. I expected decent and it was all of that. That said, it was no better than a four star rating, if I could have rated it 3.5 stars I would have. I watched the DVD and I liked it, I wish there was more. It was shot in black and white, I didn't expect I'd like VH acoustic, but acoustic was a nice touch. The CD/DVD combo is worth the extra money.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. I still havent made it past the ice nuts! Google to the Xml!
B006ON41FC|5.0|brilliant. I loclve this game so much. coleectijg nutsband flying squirrels! you all will enjoy this game a lot probably
B005QJZ5FA|4.0|For all the critics who blasted Lana Del Rey's SNL vocal performance, missed the point: it's about songwriting, stupid.  As it was for Dylan, who also has an underwhelming singing voice, Del Rey's songs are about to change the direction of pop music.  Lyrically expressive and experimental with music composition that fuses the 40's, 50's, 60's and present day sounds into dark, moody, atmospheric experiences; and wrapped in a package of modern hip beats that takes her songwriting to fascinating art pop heights.<br /><br />Every song presents an intriguing angle or point of view that makes one drawn deeper into its musical arrangement.  Haunting melodies are sung with surprising twists that stay with a listener for days after hearing them.<br /><br />The true testament to a well written song is when other artists cover it.  We just might see that happen in the future with some of Lana's music, where better vocalists can interpret her superbly written melodies for a more thrilling experience.  In the meantime, Del Rey's \\"Born to Die\\" album is about to change the present day notion of what pop music should sound like.<br /><br />***********************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />August 23, 2013<br /><br />FYI.....On this week, 19-months after the release of \\"Born to Die,\\" the album is ranked number 20 in sales and an amazing 81 weeks on the Billboard Top 200 Album Charts with total worldwide sales exceeding 4-million according to IFPI.  It was the fifth best selling album during 2012 beating out P!nk (The Truth About Love), Rod Stewart (Merry Christmas, Baby), Rihanna (Unapologetic), Mumford & Sons (Babel) and Maroon 5 (Overexposed).<br /><br />So what can Del Rey's critics say now?  They don't have a clue for what makes great music.<br /><br />Any new artist would \\"Die\\" to have this kind of success.  Not to mention, her songs being in film and commercials, including, \\"Blue Jeans\\" in Nespresso's commercial with Penelope Cruz and \\"Young and Beautiful\\" in The Great Gatsby movie.  Let's not forget Cheryl Cole's superb cover of \\"Ghetto Baby;\\" a great song that was unbelievably dropped from the \\"Born to Die\\" album.<br /><br />The continued attraction of new Lana Del Rey Fans has a lot to do with the dance remixes, especially, the transforming remix of \\"Summertime Sadness\\" done by French House DJ producer Cedric Gevais.  This amazing journey of Lana Del Rey confirms much of what I wrote in February 2012 - It's about great song writing and how it transcends when performed in other genres.

0375842209|5.0|Steven Speilburg should turn this book into film. Shoot it like \\"A Wonderful Life\\"; Bedford Falls turns into the small German town, Clarence becomes Morgan Freeman's voice only, and his relationship with our darling book theif would be like Atticus and Scout's... I think it could be a great movie

0385342063|4.0|It took me one hundred of the book's four hundred plus pages to decide whether I wanted to continue with Sophie Kinsella's \\"I've Got Your Number.\\"  I'm glad I didn't give up, for the story is fun, funny, charming, and I found myself really pulling for Poppy to make the right choice, pulling for Poppy to be happy with that choice, and I wasn't disappointed.  I wasn't familiar with the light and rather endearing storytelling talents of Sophie Kinsella.  I've seen the movie \\"Shopaholic,\\" based on an earlier book, but this is my first time reading her.  She tells a good story.  If I had any criticism at all, it would be with the footnotes.  I know they're there because Poppy, in telling her story, and in reference to fiancee Magnus' use of them in a book he's written, Poppy's having sort of \\"speed-read\\" the book, deciding she's now \\"totally into them.  Aren't they handy?  You just bung them in whenever you want and instantly look clever,\\" but, really, they're just so darned irritating that I came to ignore them just a few pages into my reading and I caution other readers to just do the same.  Footnotes aside, once you get into the story, you're not going to be disappointed.  Kinsella provides light and entertaining reading, and, once I was hooked, I wanted nothing but the happiest of endings.  Did I get one?  Of course I did; and you will too! But it's getting there that's all the fun.  And, in keeping with the technology that too many people are \\"hooked up\\" to today and just can't seem to do without, suffice it to say that cell phones and all they seem capable of doing are major players in this story too.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great game! challenging but really fun, just like the regular computer version, very good at randomi,int so you'll never play the same game twice
B0054JZC6E|3.0|i like this app but i got my hopes up. its fun for a free app but could be better. i like it tho! it puts 101 games all in 1 game.
0307719774|5.0|In a book I read recently, the author said she liked to ask herself questions and write the answers to them.  If you like to write and like to think about diverse topics, you might enjoy the exercise to stretch your mind.  It's said that 90% of the thought we have are repetitive.  So, to get ourselves out of the repetitive rut, it's good to be asked questions.  This Q&A a Day: 5 Year Journal does that.  There are 365 questions for you to answer over the next 5 years.  It will be fun to look back and see what you are thinking on any day on particular topics.  Some questions are profound such as what is your mission? Some questions are light and frothy such as What's the most expensive thing you're wearing now?  I sometimes tailor the question if I don't feel like answering the one asked to something similar.  For example, instead of what's the most expensive think you're wearing, asked what items of clothes do you hanker for now?  The appearance of this journal is attractive--love the gold-tipped pages and lovely cover.  Like other reviewers would have LOVED a ribbon to hold your place.  I like the small size of this as it's big enough to record 3-5 short sentences per day and fits on my side table with other books--bought it along with [[ASIN:0307888576 The Happiness Project One-Sentence Journal: A Five-Year Record]] and they're both about the same size. My grandmother kept a 5-year journal.  It is fun to look back and see what you were thinking about and doing several years ago in the different chapters of your life.  This is a great original gift to give to another for people who like to write, think, be creative and read.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|Happy feet 2 is really not a good movie in so many ways.  First, the plot about betraying your friends and family for fame and money is a good thing, are not values i want to teach my children.  It just blows me away that they couldn't find some decent voice actors. Most of the time they were just mumbling and you couldn't hear what they said.  The animations were bad and looked low budget. And the reuse of animations were over the top. And the scenery looked cold and static.  Trust me when i say. Dont buy this movie.  It is just a shame that i first found out while watching it why they call it \\"number two\\".
B006ON41FC|4.0|it is a fun little game to play. the kids enjoy it as well but they are easy to amuse.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Its a great game! Easy way to pass the time, easy to get addicted. Such a cute widdle squirrel, too! :)
B006MQRLSA|1.0|I had a lot of high hopes for this one. But unfortunately this movie failed just like the A's themselves. If you want to see a great baseball movie watch Major League. If you want to watch Brad Putz and Superbad's big boy put on a mind numbingly boring display of \\"acting\\" (technically i think what they were doing would be considered shmacting) then this film is for you (and by you i mean a person in a coma then by all means watch it). NOTHING happens in this movie that warrants....a movie. I have been a fan of baseball since i was a kid and 30 years later, after watching this...i might start focusing my free time on soccer. The movie was way too long....those of us that know baseball know the A's did NOT win anything during the time this movie focuses on so why did it take over 2hrs to tell the story. This would have been a better 60minutes piece (it might have, i don't know)...6-10 minute piece that explains what Bean did along with the bookworm...done. This movie was just a can of corn, a flat fastball, a slider with no bite, warning track power, no move to first, weak up the middle, basically the current A's of movies.
0385344325|2.0|I swear there was more about eating cheeseburgers, pie and drinking coffee at a diner than about anything else. Slowest book I read in the longest time. I have not read very many books by Lee Child but most of them were gripping and thrilling. This one, however, was a major snooze fest. It was a quick read but extremely unsatisfying.
B0073PZIYI|1.0|Wow - when you let ONE guy write, produce, and direct a movie you are really putting a lot of trust in him to deliver a fabulous flick....unfortunately this particular gentleman wore three too many hats. The studio really should have had someone else in the room when this thing was being either written, produced, or directed...or better yet - someone there to slap the studio exec that green-lit the project.<br />The story was terrrrble, the acing was terrrrrble, the directing was soooo trrrrrble. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS IDIOTIC TRAIN WRECK OF A MOVIE.

B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I have read many of Stephen King's books. I'm a big fan of his writing style, and it's gotten to the point where I can generally see where the writer is going to go throughout the course of his novels. Such was the case with this book. Fortunately, that didn't matter one bit.  King develops his characters so naturally and so masterfully that it almost makes the setting and the subject of this novel secondary to the interpersonal relationships, which is the whole point, I suppose. Never in a Stephen King book have I read such a moving romance element; his Jake Epping falls into a relationship so effortlessly and convincingly that it honestly took me by surprise. It is far from uncommon for him to provide a romantic interest for his characters, but it's never seemed like he has taken it so seriously as in \\"11/22/63\\". I found myself extremely charmed and emotionally invested in the main character, as well as the small town community of Jodie (the small town outside of Dallas where he bides his time), which makes up most of the supporting cast.  King clearly performed a lot of research in his process for writing the novel. While I wasn't there, I have a very clear picture of his 1950s-60s, and the minutiae involving the movements and habits of Lee Oswald is interesting. As in any work of fiction that attempts to tell history, there are some inaccuracies, which the author disclaims in his afterword. There are times when the historical aspects of the novel become a bit dry; generally the King does a fine job of intertwining the fictional elements of his story well enough to keep both subjects in the front of the reader's mind.  In the end what the novel comes down to is (like any story worth telling) the characters. I'd be lying if I were to say that part of me (most of me) didn't want Jake to just settle down and forgo his mission. The novel is a very entertaining foray into historical fiction and an interesting change of scenery for Mr. King. Of course, the novel stillfeatures a writer/teacher from Maine, but he's a very relatable teacher that made it easy to relate.  This book is very accessible to a broad range of audiences. If you enjoy good stories, you'll enjoy this one. Give it a read.
B006ZNRD06|4.0|When I set the buffer to nothing. I can stream my H264+AC3 encoded movies from my server to my Iconia over my network via a DLNA control point application (BubbleUPNP).  Any time I set the buffer to anything other than nothing I start getting buffering problems and playback reliability problems. No buffer, no problems. A little odd but hey it works great then!  Device : Iconia A500.  I did install the ARMv7 codec.

0525478817|5.0|I want to start out by saying this is an amazing book. I read it all in one sitting just as most people do with this book and I loved the humor and tragedy. It is so realistic and can give you sort of a feel of what \\"Cancer Kids\\" are going through. I'm beginning another John Green book, Looking for Alaska, now!

B006UG90RM|3.0|Well, I can't believe my eyes. Do I see over 400 reviews of \\"A Different Kind Of Truth\\" here? It's nice to see there are still people who listen to Van Halen. My guess is we're all mostly long time hardcore fans because I doubt very many kids born 1988 or later even know who Van Halen are unless their parents played something for them. \\"A Different Kind Of Truth\\" shot straight to number 2 on the Billboard Hot 200 albums chart. Not bad for a 14 year absence.<br /><br />And what about David Lee Roth returning to the fold? Something us fans had been hoping for since 1985. I listened to \\"A Different Kind Of Truth\\" multiple times, plus I went back and listened to all of Van Halen's albums in sequential order to refresh my mind, plus I read the negative and positive reviews here. While I understand some reviewers were unimpressed with David Lee Roth's vocals, I felt his vocals were the same as they had always been. I think those reviewers were being melodramatic. This is David Lee Roth, not Sammy Hagar, not Gary Cherone. The party atmosphere of the old Van Halen has returned with Roth here.<br /><br />That being said, I do have to agree with the critical reviewers that \\"A Different Kind Of Truth\\" is not Van Halen's best work. I also agree that nearly everything Eddie and Alex do here is something we've already heard before. I agree that both of them didn't really stretch and experiment too much this time around. \\"A Different Kind Of Truth\\" is just Van Halen doing Van Halen. It's a straightforward rock and roll album. That's it. Nothing more.<br /><br />I don't know if Michael Anthony is entirely missed here. Wolfgang does a suitable job on bass and background/harmony vocals.<br /><br />The lyrics are pure Roth/Van Halen. I mean a song about tattoos? A prostitute? Drugs and partying? Avoiding work? Mullets? It's all here in pure Roth/Van Halen style.<br /><br />Now, fans are going to be opinionated about what the best tracks are here, but the truth is, in today's narrow radio markets, I don't hear any real hits. Yes, you heard me. That's right. No real hits here. I didn't think there were any real hits on \\"Van Halen III\\" either, and I was right--no top 40 hits. I don't know if it's intentional, or if the band just can't make hits anymore. There are good songs, however, like \\"Tattoo\\", \\"You And Your Blues\\", \\"China Town\\", \\"Blood And Fire\\", \\"As Is\\", \\"Stay Frosty\\" and \\"Big River\\", but they're all not going to make smash hits on the radio (or MTV/VH1 either). The only place \\"A Different Kind Of Truth\\" will be a hit is with Van Halen fans (and judging by all the mixed reviews here, that's bound to be a split too).<br /><br />So, nothing new here, but Van Halen sounds promising with their first album in 14 years. Let's hope they make some more. I could see them working out the rust found here. Still, there is no band quite like Van Halen, not even today. They are one of a kind, and it's good to have them back with Roth, but I feel they are going to have to try harder than \\"A Different Kind Of Truth\\" if they are going to truly make a comeback.<br /><br />Here's how \\"A Different Kind Of Truth\\" compares to the band's previous works:<br /><br />1978 Van Halen: Five Stars<br />1979 Van Halen II: Three and a Half Stars<br />1980 Women And Children First: Four Stars<br />1981 Fair Warning: Four and a Half Stars<br />1982 Diver Down: Four Stars<br />1984 1984: Five Stars<br />1986 5150: Five Stars<br />1988 OU812: Four Stars<br />1991 For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge: Three and a Half Stars<br />1995 Balance: Two and a Half Stars<br />1998 Van Halen III: Two and a Half Stars<br />2012 A Different Kind Of Truth: Three Starsheard me.

B004DNWPY4|4.0|I relate to this book. I think many who have earned good money but don't have a lot to show for it have. I don't mean the extreme examples in the book, but it is unfortunate if you have a good job and 5 years later have little to show for it. Many have both lifestyle and wealth, of course, and I don't think he acknowledges that. But to put lifestyle before wealth after a point is indeed silly and it was great to have real life examples of this. It is so easy to expand your lifestyle so, especially in professional services in a big city. Not clever people! And often bad for your health too.

B00005JKJA|1.0|Though I loved Blue Velvet - at least with this one you could follow its convoluted plot amid all the \\"weird\\" goings on - I'm afraid this one left me cold. At first, I found myself irritated by the leading character's \\"naivete\\" - why didn't she just call the cops? But I know this never happens in movies. In Blue Velvet, the main character gets into deep waters as he takes it upon himself to \\"investigate\\" something he has no business getting involved in to begin with. Typical suspense ploy done to death by Mr Hitch, that requires the viewer to end up identifying with the main character's jeopardy - and one always does, that's the power of movies - and clever directors. Well, by the time I realized that Mullholland Drive was, first, the idealized fantasy the main character has about herself (helping another female in distress to the point of falling in love with her), then a nightmare about guilt, and that she in fact had caused the demise of the \\"one that got away,\\" I thought to myself, oh, here we go again, another cliched swipe at lesbians. Though this one dispenses with the usual icepick, she nevertheless hires a hitman to take care of her treacherous innamorata. And this took two and a half hours to tell. Yes, it's all dazzling to look at, spookily scored, and with the usual Lynchesque gallerie of grotesques, but it's way too long for the tale told. Sometimes Weird for its own sake can be its own worst enemy. I'm afraid that's the case here. Strictly for fanatical Lynch fans and straight men who get off watching Saphic sex in all its splendor, then fantasizing that one of the gals will end up \\"doing the right thing\\" and marrying a guy, and that the one dumped goes bonkers and kills the \\"object of her affection\\", rather than see her \\"be happy,\\" - thus \\"proving,\\" I guess, that Lesbians are sore losers. It's nothing more than Basic Instinct all over again, liberally doused with torrents of Felliana. As for myself, I'll take Vertigo any day.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This product is wonderfully strong, lightweight, effective, and pretty (in the pink)! Everyone with a Fire should have one! Well priced also.

B0015D3YX6|5.0|I've had two albums (Four Sail and Out Here) by Love for a long time and like them both, but FC is even better then either of them. I'd been aware of it's reputation for a long time and it is certainly well deserved. Author Lee's vocals and song writing contributions can hardly be praised enough, but it's a whole-band effort. Very well produced with some classic songs that work as well now as in 1967. Love sounds a bit like the better known Byrds, with similar use of the 12-string electric guitar, but with a bit grittier sound and really good use of some strings and horns(think fellow LA bands Doors or Spirit). This 2-disk CD features the original and a complete set of alternate takes of the songs that is pretty interesting, although it would be difficult to improve on the recordings selected for release. Some interesting additional unreleased material is included also. And don't be put off by a song with a title like \\"Maybe The People Would Be The Times or Between Clark and Hillsdale\\". The cut is killer.

B006YXTRHY|1.0|This was a total let down....they all stood around to  collect their money.  The first half was about their marriage,  the second half about nothing!  Yes, she die's and is  brought back to life as a vampire!  Who could have guessed?  This was a total lame movie, very little action and most  of it done by special effects.  No acting, just empty words.  Must be for the younger stupid impressionable kids.
B006ON41FC|5.0|you would have many upgrades and suits. its soo much fun. you have to get this.but is a little to hard.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this is a good app and I bet you will love it but sick of open feint. I bet you like it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this app daily!  Easy to navigate and it has nice features,especially the many devotionals and reading plans it has to offer.
B000EU1PKK|5.0|This album is one of my favorites, Besides I love the Keeper Of  The 7 keys parts 1,2 & 3. Part 3 is titled THE LEGACY. I love the whole album. My 2 highlight songs are RIDE THE SKY AND GORGOR. But like love the whole album.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Gives you like 20 different Bible translations from which to pick, and that is just in English.  Lots of non English, too.  Reading plans and study plans.  It will read to you.  Keeps track of where you are.  Really, I don't know what else I would want in an app...

B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this app. If you like doing games when gliding in air, and gathering items, you'll love this game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|my daughter loves playing these games all the time she cant get enough of all the different games we always have a lot of fun playing together
B005J0VPNC|1.0|The app is great. Lots of cool things you can do with it.<br /><br />My only issue is the lack of updates Amazon gets. Amazon app is so old compared to Google Play.<br /><br />Please keep Amazon updated too.<br /><br />Udate:<br />COME ON DEV! UPDATE AMAZON TOO, not just Google Play.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is really fun. I spend too much time on it. since I already beat angry birds this is my new go to game. very addicting!
B006ON41FC|5.0|awesome game fun as hell. No cons what so ever once more an awesome game all the way! tank it for being the free app of the day.
B006G7R2KW|5.0|It's an oustanding episode... But what would you expect from Mr. Sutter as well as the cast & crew of SOA... I thought about not downloading the rest but changed my mind once I found out that no matter where I'm at I can always log on to amazon and watch it on the go!!!!!!!! I'm glad I did!!!!!!!!!!!
B005X7HA6C|4.0|Takeshi Kitano's work has always interested me and I have seen several of his movies, Sonatine and Fireworks (Hana-bi) come to mind. I like Outrage although at times it seemed a bit slow moving and perhaps could have been better edited. One aspect of the movie I particularly liked besides the usual violent Yakuza story was seeing the beautiful, traditional Japanese movie sets that were used for the Yakuza boss headquarters. If that's really how they live then they are lucky indeed. Lovely traditional Japanese gardens and interiors. Despite their seeming love of all things violent, the top heads of the family have good taste in how they lived in this movie. The ending was surprising. Not sure if they do a sequel how it will evolve given how many people were killed off in Outrage.

B005Y9B5UG|5.0|This video is so much fun to watch.  I can't stop myself from getting up and dancing! Shakira is incredible!
B006ON41FC|3.0|kinda choppy on htc sensation. it is hard to avoid trees when it stutters in the middle of the game when it signs you into the scoreboard.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|When I got this app as the free app of the day, I was a litttle skeptical. All of my hesitations went away after I began to play it. It is one of the best Kindle Fire apps I have ever played! It works great on the Kindle Fire and probably works good on the other games aswell. You really need to get this app!!!! Its really addicting!! :)
B006ON41FC|5.0|love this game. its super addictive. I love the squirrel and all the challenges. don't know why everybody freaks out about the open feint. it doesn't bother me.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. Might not read it every day but sure is a super good way to get to know about the Bible and learn from it. Reading plans are the best i Highly recommend them, and you can also download different versions of the Bible in different languages. God Bless All!!
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this game so much and it has very good graphics.i would recremmend this to temple run players. i would take a break inbeeteeen tho
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this game! it kind of reminds me of temple run a little bit. so fun to play! you can close feint, it shows you how to in the beginning you just have to check 'news'. im so addicted!  :D
B004DSX5B6|3.0|First: This product is almost identical to [[ASIN:B000EDPT9K Gerber 01471 Suspension Butterfly Opening Multi-Plier with Sheath]]. The biggest differences are Bear Grylls's name, and a rubberized grip. I thought the rubberized grip was worth the 10 bucks extra. It may not be for you.  Second: The tool is pretty good. The knife blade needed some sharpening, and it's held it pretty well. The Phillips screwdriver is not the best, but it works. Loss of one star for not holding an edge as well as I think it should.  Third: The sheath sucks. I had to restitch the Velcro on, right out of the box. Then, I had it on my belt for less than a day when it broke. Loss of one star for the sheath.  Gerber used to be a great brand. Now they're middle-of-the-road. I hope they don't slide any further!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game....there are games for everyone on here I like them too. some are easy and some are hard....its perfect!
B001FB55I0|5.0|Terminator Salvation grows on you with each rewatching.  Christain Bale and Sam Worthington is great!  Blair is awesome!! \\"I see a man\\", and it thinks its human.  Skynets virtual lady reveals the inner workings, while the 'it' chooses for itself. All great stuff.  I'd sign on for Christian bale-Arnie number 5, and this time with plasma's in 50 watt range..
B006ON41FC|5.0|it is a fun game and and and. its fun to play and if your bord you can just play it
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This is a wonderful way to pass the time and challenge your mind. I would recommend it to all ages!
B006ON41FC|4.0|Doesn't get old... Hard to really master. Game play has enough randomness to keep it from getting redundant right from the start.  Some challenges, like 15 golds in a row,  are insane,  but most are a good challenge. I would give it 5 stars for tilt control instead of touch, but that's a matter of preference.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great product. I play it all the time and am very happy with the extra options like winning deal. It is amazing how fast some of the players are.
B002BWP49C|5.0|This was well worth the long year wait. Kristen Stewart was awesome. She was so totally into the birthing she was just AWESOME, What an actress. She had me believing it was really happening.OSCAR  BOUND I hope. The whole cast fit just like a they really were family. Every actor was just right for the parts they played. The view of the Island was just great. There really isn't anything that I can say bad about it. I am 67 years young, and this movie made me believe that true love does still happen. What vision everyone had.It made me laugh, cry, and believe.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I like this game because it is very fun but also teaches me to spend money and points wisely. not just buy everything you can.
B005UBNL0A|3.0|Upside is that compared to a Sandy Bridge i3 system this is more value because it is overclockable to who knows how much (I've got 4500MHz with stock cooler and +0.025V increase).<br /><br />Downside is more power consumption and seemingly no upgrade path because more powerful FX series processors are not better value than Sandy Bridge. Only this one is. And also because AM3+ isn't going anywhere, it seems but I can't be sure yet. While Socket 1155 is expected to have Ivy Bridge soon.<br /><br />Overall feeling I have is that I'd rather have a Socket 1155 Sandy Bridge based system. Oh well. Next time.<br /><br />For Linux this works well but I'm in the process of reporting a bug about a bug somewhere in the Linux stack where using the Gigabyte GA-880GMA-USB3 mainboard with the onboard graphics I have to disable CPU frequency scaling. Otherwise I have display stuttering / framedrops.<br /><br />UPDATE: I solved this bug by updating to the latest BIOS.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Hey Morons!  1 - You CAN disable Open Feint.  2 - You CAN adjust the music / sounds.  I'm only writing this review because I feel bad for this developer being spammed by so many whiny people who clearly are just taking out their anger over Open Feint on this app without even trying it.  Here's a concept: play the game before reviewing it. It tells you how to disable OF and how to adjust the sound RIGHT IN THE INTRO SCREEN! How can so many people be so frigging stupid!?  Unfortunately, this will be ignored by exactly the type of people that need to read this - the illiterate morons that have nothing better to do then tear down an app to make themselves feel better.  Reading some of these \\"reviews\\" is just embarrassing.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|As title explains this is the BEST CPU Cooler you can get. Keeps my CPU under 30 degrees Celsius even when playing games. It is wonderful, Coolermaster really hit a home run with this product.  HOWEVER! It is VERY big so you need at least around 4 inches from your motherboard to the side panel in order to fit this cooler. Otherwise it is great!
B000QRIGLC|4.0|It was a good read but a little slow in the beginning.  For anyone interested in understanding the thought process of a Navy SEAL and the training they must endure, the first half of the book is for you.  If you want to read about a first hand account of what it is like to fight in the mountains of Afghanistan then the second half of the book is for you.  Over all I enjoyed the book but the detail that was given with regard to the training became a little bit monotonous.  My respect and admiration for our military certainly increased after reading this book.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I play this on the kindle fire. the app has good graphics and is verry fun to play. my daughter loves to watch the squirl fly and yells for the birdto leave him alone.
B0063GORYU|5.0|You get what you expect. A very fun card game with nice ambience in it. It's free so might as well try it.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|Love the game and app overall. Ads are small and unobtrusive. However, the new ad. for Angry Birds Space is causing the app to quit. Wait until this is fixed before downloading.
B006ON41FC|3.0|the game is ok.. it gets addicting. it could be better though. cheap game that is all I have to say about it
B0078JOAOI|2.0|Each episode in season 2 seems to follow a template:  - 5 minute intro teasing the viewer into thinking something interesting is finally going to happen,  - 30 minutes of endless soliloquy, ineffectual shouting matches, and baby daddy drama,  - 10 minute climax in which something at least mildly interesting happens, giving the viewer hope that the next episode might be worth watching without the fast forward button.  I'm ready for the gang to get back on the road and advance the story. Sadly, AMC's listings for the rest of the season indicate [*slight spoiler*] they won't be leaving the boring old farm for the foreseeable future. I'll give the rest of the season a miss and wait to see if season 3 - should one be forthcoming - can bring back some of what made season 1 so gripping.
B005ZUR724|5.0|i love this game but there is an update needed to play and its not optional on the kindle fire. plz fix this gameloft!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love this app! great with daily reminders and easy to use. highly recommended :) i wish the kindle app would make a noise for the daily reminders though!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app has everything that I was looking for. It has the up to the minute radar, hourly forecast, weekly forecast, and current conditions, severe weather alerts, and more! In addition, it stays current with a tab in the top left corner of my tablet as a shortcut without having to search through all my apps to find it. I was unhappy with the weather channel app bc I didn't have access to the radar and it wasn't as easy to pull up. This is an absolutely fabulous app and quite useful as I live in tornado alley.
B006OAB3ME|3.0|....but lately his past few albums have had little to offer.  Sure, there is the rousing tracks from time to time....Summer of '59, a couple from Memory Almost Full, but as i was previewing this disc, i was reminded of a late 70's Beatle's parody from National Lampoon.  One of the spoofs was a picture of Sinatra, coat flung over his shoulder turning his head to look at you from walking away, and there was his buddy, Paul McCartney in the same pose.  it was heralding the new collaboration of these two.  And of course, if you have the first duets album from Tony Bennett, Paul can be found crooning out a standard along side the man who left his heart in San Francisco.  Please don't get me wrong: Paul's love for the classics is admirable.  i will probably even download this, just to keep in form of having a few good tunes off of this disc.  I understand Paul's next record to be a 'rocker', not a rocking chair, mind you.  But i just keep wondering what Mr. Lennon would have to say about this.....
B006ON41FC|4.0|this is a fun and slightly addicting game. works great on the kindle fire. despite what some reviewers say it can be disconnected from open feint, you just have to read all the tips when you start the program the first time.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is so much better than all the rest of the games ive found I play it all the time and you can choose winning losing or random it is a great time consumer for long car trips and more it lets you fangs your background and card backs too I strongly recommend it to everyone
B006ON41FC|4.0|best game ever I would like the freezing to stop though when I got it I  was addicted to it and I still am
B006ON41FC|5.0|I am sorry but on the kindle fire there is no openfient.I love the cute,goal setting game.You can buy outfits for your squirell and boasts for him (or her) .There are temperary boasts and permanent boasts.Some cost lots of nuts and some don't.I just got this game and I am in love with it.I highly incourage you to get this kid freindly app.This game is NOT a waste of money.Get the app.Kids ask your parents before getting.The openfient thing only happened to me 1 time on my kindle fire so I know its safe.For kindle only I know about openfient so don't start cussing at me if I was wrong ok.Buy app.I got the app for free.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This has become an essential for keeping records and lists. I keep copies of reciepts (take a picture with my phone and send it to Evernote). It is easy to use and works great.
B000LPR9ZS|5.0|All I can say is \\"WOW!\\" I loved the third installment of the Saw franchise. It's packed with gore and scenes that will make you cringe and look away. Amongst this thick-with-blood film, we have another unique story with yet another climatic twist at the end. \\"Saw III\\" picks up where \\"Saw II\\" left off and if you haven't seen the first two Saw movies, I strongly recommend that you watch them first. You'll see through flashbacks to the previous two Saw movies how \\"Saw III\\" fits together with the other two like a puzzle piece, so all three are linked together perfectly.  Amanda (Shawnee Smith) is back once again and she's vicious! She is a very strong and pivotal character in the film, and Smith does an outstanding job of portraying the violent, emotionally unstable Amanda. As Jigsaw's/John Kramer's accomplice, she is helping him with his latest game, but it's Amanda who is truly put to the test as you will see as the film progresses. John is bedridden, hooked up to a heart monitor, dying from cancer and using an oxygen mask to help him breathe, however he uses his bleak situation as a tool for his game. Amanda kidnaps a woman named Lynn (Bahar Soomekh), a depressed, pill-popping surgeon with marital problems, and takes her to the building where John lays waiting. Lynn's test? Keep John alive until another person in the building completes his series of tests. But it won't be that easy. John will need brain surgery and fast (the brain surgery segment is probably my favorite part in the film). Lynn must do the gruesome surgery and keep John from flat lining, or else the shotgun collar that Amanda placed around her head will go off, and she too will flat line.  The other person going through his own tests is a man named Jeff (Angus Macfadyen), a grieving father whose son was hit and killed by a drunk driver. Ever since the tragedy, Jeff has become bitter and emotionally lost, clinging to his deceased son's toys, neglecting his daughter and obsessing about revenge on thoseresponsible for what happened. But Jigsaw has made the perfect game for Jeff, where he will have the ultimate choice to forgive and let go, or continue to let his hatred and hunger for revenge consume him. Jeff will come face to face with all those involved in his son's untimely death; the only witness to the crime who ran from the scene, the judge who gave the driver a light sentence, and finally the man responsible for the death of his son. All are in their own Jigsaw traps and it's up to Jeff whether they live or die. We're treated to some new inventive traps; the Freezing room trap, the pig juice vat trap and the Rack trap that twists limbs.  So the web of John, Amanda, Jeff and Lynn make \\"Saw III\\" what it is. However there are some other main factors of the movie that are brought to our attention at the start of the film. Take the situation of Troy (J. Larose), a man who seemingly enjoys being in prison more than having freedom. Troy is in a chain trap, where the chains are literally hooked into various areas of his body. He must release himself before a bomb goes off. But we'll find out that there is something different about this particular Jigsaw trap; something that doesn't ring true to Jigsaw's philosophy of earning the privilege to stay alive. Such is also the case with detective Alison Kerry (Dina Meyer), the ever devoted crime investigator from the first two Saw movies who blames herself for the disappearance of detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Whalberg) (yes, he's back for \\"Saw III\\"). According to Jigsaw, she is as dead as the corpses she investigates and therefore has the opportunity to join death as well. She has been put into a \\"ribcage angel trap\\", where there is a device hooked into her ribcage. She must unlock the device with a key that is inside a beaker of acid within a minute or else......well, you get the picture. But again, this Jigsaw trap is not your average Jigsaw trap. It's seemingly a whole different game.  Fantastic special effects, great acting, intense storyline, new twists, heart-pounding sequences, gore galore and an amazing ending; yes, \\"Saw III\\" more than delivers. Writers Leigh Whannell (who also appears in a key sequence of this film) and James Wan do it again, and Darren Lynn Bousman is back as director. They do an excellent job of bringing \\"Saw III\\" together with the first two. As much as I like the first Saw, this one probably beats it out by a hair. \\"Saw III\\" is horror at its best. You don't want to miss it.
B006ON41FC|3.0|I like the goals instead of levels. The fact that they really want you to review their product makes me want to give it a lower rating.
