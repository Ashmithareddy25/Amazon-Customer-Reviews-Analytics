0345529057|5.0|I'm guilty to admit that I got into Song of Ice and Fire after watching the HBO series. Even though I saw both seasons I'm starting from the first book and I love it so far. I have big hopes for the story and can't wait till I reach the third book.<br /><br />I had so many doubts before buying the books, because I've read quite a few reviews which included missing\falling pages and so on. Also the returning and replacing sounded kinda troublesome + so much time wasted. But none of my worries came true, for I didn't have a single problem with the set. It's amazing, I couldn't be happier. The books are so cute size wise, though reasonably comfortable to hold. I have to mention that the price for all the set is incredible. There was little chance to find the books where I live, so I can honestly say that this was the best option to get the books and I'm so glad I choose this option.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|similar to other village games Ice Age Village quickly drew me in. It did take a little while to explain to my son how to exit, but avoiding in game purchases is easy.
0393061310|5.0|This is a very illuminating book.  Readers should pick it up, not thinking that they are going to get the final answer about the reasons for inequality, but at least getting another important piece of the puzzle for modern inequality.  Jared Diamond writes this book to answer the question of a New Guinea native named Yali.  Essentially Yali asked (to paraphrase) \\"why do you (Jared Diamond & the wealthy West) have so much, and we have so little?\\"  Diamond goes out of his way to state that all racial theories of wealth and inequality are fundamentally mistaken.  Instead, it was climatological factors such as soil, available crops, domestic animals, and the like, which gave Eurasian cultures a decided edge in food production.  Food production was essential for larger populations, work specialization and invention.  This in turn created the competitive edge, and led to the \\"guns, germs and steel\\" that helped the Conquistadors, and other European powers, essentially colonize much of the globe.  Bearing an open mind, readers should find this a profitable read, and a fascinating part of a puzzle that has baffled many, and will continue to be of great importance.  Diamond's expertise spans many fields, and his work is certainly one that will be recognized for years to come.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this game is SO addicting and SO fun! I could play this game all day! I recommend it for others! :)
B00006WKSZ|3.0|The Scorpions were an okay band in the 70's and this is an okay release.  But, it does not, and I repeat, does not measure up to the Scorpions from the Lovedrive album on.  Anyone who tells you this... probably also thought the Lawrence Welk rock rocked back then!  There is always a minority of people who always try and say that music that did not sell was really great.... and all of us didn't know what we were doing by not buying it.  Well, we're still not buying it now.  You sub-culture music critics can have your subpar musical efforts and enjoy them along with that 1970's shag carpet that's still in your house.  The rest of us will take the supercharged, sonic blasting music of Lovedrive and beyond.

0689835604|5.0|I received this as a gift and have bought almost every one of these lift the flap books since.  My daughter loves to lift the flaps and gives us big smiles when the picture below is revealed.  Sure, she's pulled off some of the flaps, but it's nothing that a little clear, shipping tape can't handle.  Seriously, LOVE these books - my daughter wants them read to her several times a day and will lift the flaps when she \\"reads\\" them by herself.  I feel if she likes playing with books then she will probably enjoy reading when she's older.  Either way, I love the bright, beaming smiles she gives me knowing her accomplishment when she lifts the flap and sees the picture below.
B000YAA68C|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie... I bought the book too. I am hoping that the parts that I loved about the movie will be even greater in the book.  Hillary Swank was fantastic!
0679809015|5.0|My daughter loves lift the flap books and, had I known this one was so adorable, I would have been reading it to her much earlier.  The flaps are a little more challenging to open than other flap books, (some of them lift to the side, down, up), and they're made of cardboard with a little notch on the opening side.  However, my daughter can not get enough of this book!  She plays with it all the time!  Maybe it's because it's a tiny board book and fits perfectly in her tiny hands, I don't know, but she really loves this book.  I will buy another one if this one gets lost or destroyed.
0307341577|5.0|Dark Places by Gillian Flynn is a winner! WOW, this is good! Libby Day, age 7, survives a night when her mom and two sisters were murdered by their brother in \\"The Satan Sacrifice of Kinnakee, Kansas.\\" Libby testifies to this in court. However, 25 years later, the money she inherited runs low so when she is offered money to sell family mementos, she agrees but begins to have second thoughts if her brother was the murderer.<br /><br />I liked the writing and lots of twists and turns with a surprise ending. I highly recommend this book if you enjoy suspense and murder mysteries. I also loved [[ASIN:030758836X Gone Girl: A Novel]] by Gillian Flynn.

B00009L1OB|3.0|An ok album by talented musicians and entertainers that rode the crest fast and in the limelight...songs are good, but a few memorable as standouts.
B000SQJ2JG|1.0|It's not Deep Purple but a Bolin, Coverdale, Hughes project with support from Lord and Paice. It has its moments but I almost never listen to it: Bolin is just too derivative, repetitive, and boring. This is not surprising since I have never heard an interview with him in which he could string enough words together to make a meaningful statement...yadda, yadda, yadda.<br /><br />Get this album if you want, but it's certainly not a must-have.
B000002GYW|3.0|After leaving from Linda Ronstadt, they had to evolve from country to rock and this album helped in the journey of the 70's...like the rock more.

030758836X|5.0|Zowie! The battlefield of marriage has never been more deadly than in Gillian Flynn's latest novel, GONE GIRL.  When perfect wife Amy Dunn disappears from her home under suspicious circumstances, her husband, Nick, well known around his home town as a good guy, is the main suspect.  Amid a media circus that alternatively damns and absolves Nick as the days of Amy absence count down, the story of their marriage slowly unfolds.  Told from the alternating viewpoints of husband and wife, the switchbacks and surprises never let up in this incredibly suspenseful nail-biter. If you're looking for an involving mystery that doesn't hew to bestseller mystery tropes, GONE GIRL is for you.  What a pleasure! Gillian Flynn delivers!
B000002GXJ|3.0|I want to like their live performances, but they seem slow and country with some engagement of the audience...great tunes, but the shows?
B0027BOL4G|3.0|There are a lot of negative feelings I'm sure viewers associate with watching \\"Food Inc.\\" I personally was left with feelings of impotence and hopelessness.<br />The final message, as so many documentaries are wont to do, states that \\"you\\" the consumer has the final say and the power to change the market. While this is of course true in theory and in essence, it does not always play out that way. I am more than likely to simply buy the cheapest available version of any product I desire or need. I want my grocery list to feed me for the longest time for the least amount of money, and that is that.<br />As a young person with a small amount of money at my disposal, that is my policy. It is tough to imagine so many other Americans who also only have a small amount of disposable income doing anything other than buying the cheapest product available.<br />This is not to say most Americans equipped with the knowledge supplied by the film wouldn't try and buy organically farmed products, it just means that most will not when it comes to saving money and feeding their families.<br />\\"Food Inc.\\" is extremely moving. But I can't say there is much I am willing to do to change the market given my current status. If I had more disposable income, as my parents do, I would certainly buy organically, and I believe most other concerned Americans would. If the government subsidized organic produce instead of protecting corporations like Mansanto, this would all be so much different. At the end of the day, Americans want it cheap and fast
B007IQWQ88|5.0|I have very little to say about this release. I was looking forward to it and it arrived this week. All I can say is: Compare the sound to the original LP releases and also some of the early CD incarnations and you'll be very impressed. What I've heard so far is exceptional and the many trips to memory lane were very satisfying. Thanks to DG for including all the recording information in the splendid booklet. Get this set before it disappears!
B002NXSRVG|5.0|All i have to say is wow this movie is awesome especially for the price it has non stop action from begining to end and being a martial artist for 13 yrs i really appreciated all the ninja action this is a great buy

But all and all I enjoyed the story with the fighting and hot sex.......reminds me of my first relationship .......it was up and it was down but we lasted 14 years......Loved the part when Travis has had enough and hauls Abby out of the party over his shoulder and makes the statement that we are going to get this settled now !  Yea Buddy ! That's what you needed to do much earlier .......anyway I enjoyed the story and it takes you back to the time of young love and all that goes with it......would love to relive some of my past !

B0086700CM|5.0|A lot of people have been complaining about how awful this game is on the Kindle Fire, but I've actually found it to be quite fun. Great bathroom game. I would absolutely recommend it to everyone who enjoys the casual touch based run game.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|controls are at times hard to use. I have not updated so I can not speak to all the other reviews that say do not update.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|As advertised, won't disappoint. I really like this product. Have to buy another one. Not only does it have the 3 primary needs built into a pocket sized tool (plus a lanyard hole), its also well built, and all the components appear to be replaceable. Very handy indeed. My dd knife seems to respond well to it ;^)

B004UID2LC|5.0|works great on my kindle fire. I recommend to everyone who likes youtube with a fire. I have not experienced any bugs and I constantly use this app.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great way to do your daily devotion and Bible study.  All the different translations is a great study aid.  If you want to get close to God read His word and this is a great way to do it.
B0040JHKZ0|5.0|After getting some \\"minimal\\" shoes and suffering from a stress fracture in my shin, I stopped running for a couple months and when I picked back up, got a pair of these. I'm 5'7\\", 155 pounds, if that helps anyone. These are my go-to shoe ever since I started running 6 years ago, and every time I try something else for the sake of something different, I regret it. They are comfortable, feel great to run in, and I rarely if ever get any injuries using these shoes.
0525425764|2.0|Was written well but very short and lacked much of a plot. Did not understand when buying book it was for children.
0345529057|4.0|This is the first set of fiction books that I've read purely for my own enjoyment. Ever since season 2 ended on HBO, I had to read the rest to find out what happens. The books drag on at times, such as during Bran's chapters, but besides that the stories are pretty engaging. Would definitely recommend to anyone that likes fantasy or the HBO series.
B0074JOCIG|5.0|This DVD has to be Joe B's best DVD to date (Even more spectacular than the Royal Albert Hall and BCC's Live over Europe) with a special cameo from Beth Hart (one of my favorite Bonamassa records) this Blu Ray/DVD is easily worth the $20.00 for admission.
B007VT6QSI|5.0|I love this album. It is definitely more mature sounding than when Biebs first started out. I haven't fully listened to the album, but I love it! I also love the photo book. Keep up the great work, JB!

B007EC27QM|5.0|I haven't had any problems yet. Easy to use.  Easy to read. Nothing fancy, but definitely worth the $0.99 compared to other calculators I've tried.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use it everyday for daily devotional and my church has wick so I take my kindle fire to church and use this app as my Bible because I'm able to go from verse to verse quickly without having to go through pages and I can change versions to match what pastor is reading and finally I can enter notes from sermon this app is great.. my daughter also has on her phone and she loves to have it read to her...
B002KSPKRS|1.0|Only after 6 days of use this particular headset has become unbearable. During use it has constant popping and buzzing sounds. Also the headset periodically drops its signal. The Battery life is pretty bad as well. Overall it is a frustrating device that for the price does not deliver the audio experience any gamer is looking for.
B004FOA84A|4.0|This is a pretty decent game. It does not hold your hand and make it easy at all. Some puzzles would actually stump me for long periods at a time.
1250000971|5.0|This book is a second and final installment of \\"Only Time Will Tell:, which I read a few months ago.....it is beautifully written and has many twists and turns as only Jeffrey Archer can do.........a beautiful story full of plots and subplots......a quick and fast read......I could barely put it down until I finished it.  W.B.Goetz, Lemoyne, Penna.
B003Q6D25K|1.0|Do you like watching paint dry? Do you count the Cheerios in your cereal bowl? Then you may enjoy this movie, which is one of the most boring, unscary horror movies ever made. Endless hours of watching a pool skimmer at work! Months of a video camera focused on the stairs! Years of uninteresting people chattering about nothing much!<br /><br />A few mildly startling moments, but only relative to the overall utter tedium. Some nonsense background nattering added to the mix as a sort of explanation for what was happening.<br /><br />Remember in the Munsters when Igor the Bat flew about squeaking? Well, that was more scary than anything in this movie.
0439023521|5.0|I honestly purchased the [[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games]] so that I could read the story before I see it in a movie.  The name of the movie, the name of the book goes against every fiber in my being; although my look into both were for a glimmer of hope, humanity, and optimism:  I found all 3.  It was still exceedingly difficult to suspend my beliefs and sublimate to enjoy the book and eventually the movie....  I will give it another try and read the trilogy, before I totally count myself out.  Hurting Wimp
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it was good. not all the games where as geat as I was hoping though. over all I give it a 8 out of 10.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really like this app.  If you are a solitare player it is User friendly and fun to play .  Graphics are good. Not quite sure I understand the &quot;Type of Deal&quot; thing but I always use the random deal anyway. I personally don't see the point in playing if you know you are going to win&hellip;where is the challenge in that?  Anyway (lol) I would recommend this game.
1118273052|4.0|The interview format necessitates great wordiness.  So, with a book like this, one tends to skim for nuggets.  I found a couple that apply to me.  Perhaps you will too.
0345803485|5.0|I didn't think I would like this book but decided to give it a try because everyone was raving about it. I fell in love with the characters and the story line immediately!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|From the imaginative mind of Edgar Rice Burroughs, Creator and Author of Tarzan, Comes his First and Greatest Hero, Brought to the Screen by Andrew Stanton, who brought 'Finding Nemo' and 'Wall-E' to life, you must see \\"John Carter\\" of Mars!<br /><br />Make no mistake, \\"John Carter\\" is the original, anything that you may see or may think was taken from other tales and films let be known that they were in fact found in the John Carter of Mars saga first. Written a century ago and first published in 1912, \\"a Princess of Mars\\", the first book in the series established the grand planetary adventure that has been borrowed from ever since.<br /><br />The film stays reasonably close to the book, without strangling itself. There are compromises, but they are needed to adapt book to film. The choices made about what to cut out or compress or combine were well thought out, and the right choices to make to create a fun film for all to enjoy. There is action, there is excitement  and there is even romance.<br /><br />The performances are solid.<br /><br />What I really liked about the performance by Taylor Kitsch as John Carter is those \\"what the heck\\" moments. Those moments where the Civil War vet witnesses what for him should be quite strange, exotic, and downright bizarre. He is not stunned to the point of hesitation, but just for a moment an expression of astonishment flashes across his face and then it is gone as it gets down to business.<br /><br />Lynn Collins as Dejah Thoris is absolutely fabulous. She is sexy, she is tough, and she kicks butt.<br /><br />Willem Dafoe as Tars Tarkas, though his role is substantially truncated, does a fine job of bringing his character to life and hints at the greater story found in the book about his relationship with Sola as portrayed by Samantha Morton.<br /><br />Kantos Kan, has a much, much smaller role in the film than is found in the book, James Purefoy does an excellent job with what screen time was provided.<br /><br />Mark Strong as Matai Shang, is the film's main antagonist. While not actually found in the first book, it does tie in with the later books, and set up the film to fit together in a trilogy better. His addition to this first film and other minor changes served to make the story more coherent than what was found in the original source material.<br /><br />Woola is wonderful. He acts just as he did in the books, and he alone would make this film worth seeing, even if the rest were not so great.<br /><br />For those of you worried about this being a Disney film and thinking they will tone it down too much, there are no worries here. Martian blood is not red, there are scenes where John Carter is literally covered from head to toe in his opponents life giving fluids.<br />The DVD, the Blu-Ray, and the Blu-Ray 3d are all great. It allows you to enjoy this great film in the format you desire, or may be available to you at the given time. I love the 3d, but this film is beautiful in 2d as well.<br /><br />So, watch the film, read the books and enjoy good old fashioned action adventure like has not been seen before.
0553386794|5.0|I give this book five stars because it is extremely well-written, cogent, coherent, structured and well-integrated.  The narrative style was also extremely effective at drawing in the reader, investing them, and yet still keeping pace with the story and preventing it from becoming overly dull, drab, or overbearing.<br /><br />The story is very interesting, with relatively well-fleshed out characters, highlighting character flaws as well as virtues and generally attempting to avoid overly-stereotyping any given individual.  Cowards will find courage out of loyalty and friendship, intelligent men will be blinded because they are too honorable to conceive the reality of the matter, boys will occasionally reflect a degree of maturity relevant to their age, and yet will not divorce themselves too far from their roots.  The plot weaves long and winding, never boring, but never straying too far from what is expected.  The most important thing is that the story is gritty and realistic, taking sufficient imitation from the medieval period from which it draws its inspiration that nothing is so far beyond reality that it divorces itself from relatability.<br /><br />Nevertheless, there are few plot points that are unsurprising.  To be sure, the initial grave injury of one of the main characters was particularly surprising, and the reason for that injury rather unexpected.  Yet, the deaths, betrayals, intrigues, and the like are all rather predictable, only the timing of which is difficult to divine.  I expect many of those who write of how the plot twists are \\"unexpected\\" or who complain of \\"shock\\" about certain plot points are those who have taken to reading this as a standard fantasy novel for which those stereotypical strings are generally carried out in a linear fashion and resolved as if they were fairy tales.  Not A Game of Thrones.  The proper way to read this book is to view it as medieval statesmanship placed within a fantasy realm.  As a student of history, nothing in this book came as a surprising shock, but rather, was either well-expected, or a reasonable development from that which is expected.<br /><br />Despite nothing being particularly out of one's expectation, the fact that the book is well-written, characters are portrayed sufficiently to provide depth and empathy, and that the plot itself does not try to rely on fanciful over-extensions of reality or on unrealistic providence or fortuity makes it a great read, raising your hopes for the unlikely and providing a profound sense of sorrow when the inevitable is realized.<br /><br />Read it in its proper context and there should be no surprises (at least with regards to intrigue, warfare, or natural plot developments; the supernatural aspect is hard for me to grasp as I am neither a particularly 'spiritual' individual, nor a general reader of the fantasy genre).  However, that does not detract one bit from the enjoyability and enthralling nature of the book itself.

1610454812|5.0|Simply put, this is one of the most amazing stories I've ever read about. I could not put this book down. I'm going to give it as a gift to many people.  Man alive.  Thank God for the lives of people like Adam Brown and their families who support them back home. This story made me laugh and cry within minutes of one another. At first I thought, \\"you know, they don't make 'em like Adam Brown anymore.\\"  But wait . . .  they do.  They are called Navy SEALS!  Thank you men for your service and sacrifice.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Most fun android game I've played yet. Perfectly executed. Simple intuitive but addictive game play. There is the option to use real money to buy more golf bucks for unlocking power ups, but they don't nag you to do so and you can still unlock everything by simply playing the game and earning achievements. Great game!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is terrible! Just a dark version of the old Harlequin romance novels. Such a waste of my time and money.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|This so called free game is anything but free.  If you actually want to progress in the game, you must spend real $dollars to advance.  You could literally spend hundreds of dollars buying their in game currency to buy blocks of energy to complete your tasks. Really??? What an amazing ripoff!!  This is a total SHAM!!<br />They took a good game concept and ruined it by taking advantage of their customers.<br />These guys are a bunch of light weights.<br />Save your money.
0345803485|5.0|I must admit that I read this book last.  I picked up book two in local store, and loved it!! Ordered the last two from Amazon. Perhaps that was why after reading book two, then three, I wasn't suprised or shocked.  This is love story and two people learning to trust each other, abit in what seems to be so strange and dark for most.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love card games and spider solitare is a particular  favorite. This software is fun and challenging  to play without being frustrating or too easy or boring.

B0068MNNOE|4.0|As a high school English teacher, I love (nearly) all that is Shakespeare and thoroughly love the Renaissance as a whole. When first seeing the trailers for \\"Anonymous,\\" I was intrigued and excited, though not ever really giving any credence to the idea that William Shakespeare did not actually write the plays we have come to know as his.<br /><br />I was extremely disappointed in learning of its severely limited release in theaters (the nearest being over eight hours away) and realized that I would have to wait until it made its debut on DVD. It was well worth the wait.<br /><br />I agree with the reviews that state that the names can be rather challenging to follow, and I expect that I will need to watch it again, to make sure that I caught everything. However, it is worthy of multiple viewings. The acting and costuming are superb.<br /><br />Though I went into it with the idea that I would dislike the character portrayed as the \\"true\\" author of all that is recognized as Shakespeare's work, I found myself quite sympathetic toward de Vere. Not only did I feel for this man who could take no credit for his great works, but I found myself truly disliking this \\"Will Shakespeare,\\" a greedy and opportunistic actor who stumbled into the chance of claiming the works as his own creations.<br /><br />Now, having said all of that, do I believe that William Shakespeare did not actually write what he is credited with having written? No. This movie, an interesting work of fiction, is simply that. However, for the first time, I truly considered the idea that someone other than William Shakespeare could have written all of these works, and due to his/her station in life, was unable to claim authorship of them. Though I do not believe this to be the case, I would truly sympathize with such a person having to live his/her life watching a lesser \\"actor\\" claim to be the creator of beloved characters such as Hamlet, Iago (whom I truly love to hate), Benedick & Beatrice, and so many others. It makes for a very interesting what if...<br /><br />I would highly recommend this film to any who love Shakespeare, the Renaissance, Elizabethan England, or simply have a love of literature. It provides an interesting look at an idea that many of us never bothered to truly consider.

B0086700CM|5.0|this is the best game that any one can have in the whole entire world!!!<br /><br />IT IS THE BEST GAME EVER. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />FROM TAMAR GREENHILL
0307352145|5.0|The blurb on the cover, \\"The Power of Introverts in a world that can't stop talking,\\" sold me on the book. Very catchy. But now I see over two hundred reviewers, mostly introvertish I would imagine, who can't stop expounding. I myself, a proud introvert, am disappointed at all that verbish. Even<br />Cain apparently found it hard to stop when she had me excited half way through the book. I loved that first half. It was the other half that had me snoring. Sorry.<br /><br />H. Trussell Pyle is the author of the recent tightly wound novel Charlie's Hoot, and three nonfiction books having to do with recovery from alcoholism and drug addiction.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I just needed something basic for my everyday math. it is very easy to use and the very large numbers are so great on my little touch screen. no fumbling.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|me and my daughter both love this game...it is fun and easy...she cant read yet but has no problem playing because each instruction also comes with a picture of the action you are supposed to perform.
B0088TG252|1.0|Slow, boring and predictable.  Recipe for 2 hours wasted that you'll regret and never get back.  While Denzel does an OK job, the script is pretty limiting.  I wondered how Reynolds would be in a serious action role and he was, as I suspected, not believable and bland.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|One of the best apps I have purchased. I would recommend this to anyone.  I have been in the parking garage.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like this game. its very fun and my bf and I challenge each other and also help each other on the various games.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is great. I have it on my kindle,  my daughter has it on her iPod and my finance has it on his phone. We all love to play it and work for the trophies.
B003Y5H5F6|1.0|This movie was so bad I will not add it to my collection. The first three were awsome and some of my all time favorites but this one was junk. plot was horrid, action was null, no scott. the whole set up was bad bad bad. not sure how anyone gave it 4 and 5.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its fun.  just tricky on game wording to say 101 games, but you have to earn them. its easy to earn enough points though.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|The best keyboard layout out there and it has awesome predictive text on top of that. It has different color themes, too.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|these games are great and so addicting. I highly reccomend purchasing this app.it is a lot of fun. all ages can play this.
B000OP1M6M|5.0|An overall great watch at a great price!  Deep, matte blue dial with outstanding lume on the indices, and the brushed/polished case wears comfortably due to the recessed crown at 4:00.  The black dial/black bezel version of the same watch (SKX007) seems to a be a bit more popular, so I wanted to get the blue/red bezel version to have something different.  I'm glad I did!  The bracelet is very comfortable and it was easy to remove the extra links myself to get a perfect fit.  Keeping great time (approx. +12 per day out of the box) and I expect it will settle down and keep even better time as it breaks-in.  Seiko makes a very collectible line of self-winding diver's watches, and this one is very popular with collectors - plenty of modifications readily available and with a strong aftermarket, there are tons of options if you ever want to customize your watch.  I couldn't be happier!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I can't put the game down. My sister found it and within twelve hours all four of my  family members were glued to their phones
B008CPZNL6|3.0|ugh, even the beta version was more stable! this app is very promising paired with a cool design but performs and functions poorly: constant  force closures, resets, hangups and blank pages. a very frustrating experience, going back to pulse, may return if stability and performance improve.
B005J9ZDYK|5.0|We LOVE Shaun the Sheep.  This DVD contains 40 episodes (each about 7 minutes long) from season 2 of the British series.  These are appropriate and enjoyable for all ages (big giggles from 3 to adult).  Everyone in our family enjoys this series.  The plots center around the adventures of Shaun and his flock of sheep.  They live on a farm with a well-meaning but somewhat clueless farmer.  The sheep battle their rivals, the cat and the wily pigs with the help of the sheep dog, Bixby.  In these shorts, there are no words, this is pure pantomime.  Highly recommend!
1400052181|3.0|This book was described as new, unread, with some shelf wear.  The front cover had significant damage; the book was not new, despite being unread.
B0081J9OWC|5.0|It took a couple of listens but once I fell into the deep groves of Jade and Alexander I found it hard to get back out.  There's a slow song or two I tend to skip, but another beautiful bunch of sounds coming from this band.  After seeing them live at the Phoenix stop of their railroad tour last April I'll probably buy every hum, crash and thump they produce.
B0086700CM|5.0|I am so glad they have temple run now. I think its the best game ever. Now I can play it on my kindle. You should really get this game!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Completely AMAZING! From start to finish, this book had me on the edge of my seat. I actually lost sleep and couldn't put it down, it's that much of a literary masterpiece. Any avid reader will enjoy this book, regardless or his/her genre interests. I will definitely be enjoying more books by Hugh Howey.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|this game is sooo much fun I love it but after a while it wont open unless I turn off my kindle fire and turn it back on then it will open but stillthis game is so much fun it is like Mario but with difrerent charachters. love it and hate it lol
B004VMUS9G|3.0|NOTE: I have not tried this app yet. Just an opinion.  So... well I looked through lots of the apps, mabye the first 50, and most of the reviews. So far I couldn't find any good ones. All the bad ones are like, you have to leave the fire on full wake mode to use or like it doesn't go off and more. So far this app has the most likes and has pretty good comment about it.  If you really need an alarm I think that you should get this app.
0307959856|2.0|The characters were insipid, the plot boring, and the writing style surprisingly bad.  I expected more from a collaboration between Austin and James.
B004EFN6K8|3.0|This DVD, recorded in San Sebastian, Spain, in 2008, features only 10 tracks, and one of them is the band introduction.  Diana shines on the other nine selections, including two performances not found on her other concert DVDs, \\"I'll String Along with You,\\" and the title track.<br /><br />This is not an authorized Diana Krall DVD.  The picture quality is not as good as her other concert DVDs, though the sound quality is fine.  The end credits are in Spanish; this may have been taped for Spanish TV.  This is probably one of those \\"gray-market\\" releases; not a bootleg, but not completely legal either.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B004FWTCYY Doing All Right-in Concert]] is also available on vinyl on Amazon; other sites list a CD release as well.<br /><br />Most Krall fans will probably want to stick with her authorized DVDs, [[ASIN:B00005Y3ZM Diana Krall - Live in Paris]], [[ASIN:B00067OLN4 Diana Krall - Live at the Montreal Jazz Festival]], or [[ASIN:B001VS46DC Diana Krall: Live in Rio]], also available as a [[ASIN:B001VS46DM Blu-ray]] or [[ASIN:B002N7W3NK Special Edition]].  But Krall completists should seek this DVD out.
B0086700CM|4.0|fun game. great for passing the time. normally, I get frustrated after a bit... so it's a game I keep playing. :D fun for a free game.
0385360169|5.0|Absolutely amazing book of a lifetime. I love it so much it changed my world can't wait to read the othera
0345803485|3.0|The writing is terrible.<br /><br />\\"It's a beautiful May morning. Seattle at my feet. Wow, what a view. Beside me, Christian Grey is fast asleep. Wow, what a view.\\"<br /><br />Don't waist your money...
B0063GORYU|5.0|this is a fast game with just enough strategy to be interesting without frustrating. you can decide how challenging to make it by choosing how many suits to include.
B007KZY1YY|4.0|These books frustrate me. While I was reading this latest book following on from Fifty Shades of Grey, there were so many time I was mentally banging my head against the wall. In places it felt a little monotonous and the sex scenes we still saucy, but they said the same things to each other every time.<br />Yes he was damaged and constantly needs reassurance, but it kind of gets a little old when she has to keep repeating that she is 'his' several times in each chapter. And Ana's lack of self confidence can get a little old, but having said that, I still read the book in record time and often couldn't drag myself away. That was what made it so frustrating for me.<br /><br />If you liked the first book then you will definitely love this one. The story line became more about the two of them forging a relationship and learning about each other than his 'playroom', so because of this I enjoyed the second book more than the first one, and despite myself I know that tomorrow I will go against my better judgement and go buy the third (and secretly enjoy it).<br /><br />Definitely makes the commute to and from work a little more interesting to say the least...
B006E4QCXU|5.0|You really don't do anything other then swirl your fingers around to make tiny dots follow.  I WANT A REFUND!!!!!
B007MJSQSK|1.0|Amazon charged me for this movie. Could not watch it as all it did was buffer all the time and freeze. Streaming was very poor and would not recommend amazon for movies. I also have Netflix. streaming is AWESOME and no buffering or freezing. will not rent anymore from amazon as they still charged me for movie.I think they need an upgrade.
0345803485|4.0|I liked it. I mean I do think there should be a base story about something rather than some billionaire hot dude stalking this average clumsy girl. I did enjoy it, I can't say it is bad I did buy book 2 and 3 so I am interested. But It seems like a teenager wrote it. All the weird little sayings. Very strange that way. But it was good.
B00009MGGI|5.0|I don't buy DVDs very often. Thanks to streaming video and DVD rentals, I can almost always find plenty of movies and TV shows to watch at home, without buying DVDs. Including the entire House of Cards trilogy. I enjoyed it hugely back in the day when it was broadcast on PBS over, I think, three seasons. I watched it again on VHS tape (remember that?) a few years after the final season aired, and found it as enjoyable as before.<br /><br />And recently I have at least twice watched the entire trilogy via streaming video. I'd expected to hit the FF key a lot, because after all, this series was made a few decades ago, I've seen it before, and how much could I possibly enjoy it one more time?<br /><br />The answer: hugely. I rarely pushed the FF key, I found myself savoring the whole trilogy again as if I were seeing it for the first time. There's a lot to it: a brilliant script, wonderful production values, good direction, and a fab-u-lous cast. At the time I'm writing this review, there are more than one hundred other reviews, and no need for me to detail all the reasons why this is one of the best dramas ever broadcast on TV on either side of the Atlantic.<br /><br />After realizing how well it stands the test of time, I indulged myself by buying this boxed DVD set of the series. And yes: I've already watched it again on these DVDs. I'm pleased with this purchase, and don't expect to sell, donate or otherwise part with this boxed set. It's firmly on my shelf, and a happy addition to my DVD library.
B004QX07G4|1.0|I LOVE Ellen!  I love what she stands for, I love her wit, I love her sense of humor, I love that she is a lover of animals and I love that she is so giving.  That said, I hate this book.  It's like one LONG monologue on her TV show instead of actually being about \\"something.\\"  There is a serious lack of a plot or anything resembling such.  There is even one chapter - SPOILER - where she talks about how at the end of the chapter there's something spectacular that we should all wait for (for what seems to be 20 pages), and the chapter ends.  All build up, no deliver.<br /><br />Sorry, Ellen, you missed the mark with this one. Back to TV!
B007XNAQLA|5.0|There's no greater joy in music than seeing musicians  you've loved for nearly forty years play better in their 60's and 70's than when you first discovered them.  Unlike pro athletes where we can only enjoy their prime for a decade if we're lucky, great musicians continue to grow and expand until their final breaths.  I remember seeing Buddy Rich come creeping onto the old Tonight Show set in the 1980s and thinking  \\"c'mon...really?\\"  Then old Buddy settled down behind the drum set in his leisure suit and proceeded to blow the lid off the joint.  I was amazed then.  I'm even more amazed now that \\"my guys\\" have hit that stage in their careers and are still bringing it better than they ever have on \\"The Mothership Returns\\".<br /><br />I read one critical comment that questioned the resurrection of old compositions.  Do we criticize a brilliant pianist for resurrecting Rachmaninoff or Tchaikovsky?  We're not talking about tunes from the bubble gum pop music factory which are time-locked in relevance by the churn of musical fads on the Billboard charts.  Return To Forever and their musical contemporaries created dynamic compositions of unparalleled complexity and beauty which remain unrivaled to this day.<br /><br />Like the recent releases of \\"Returns\\" and \\"Forever\\" these magnificent musicians expand and improve upon their former works by the sheer preponderance of new arrangements combined with their ingeniously exponential growth as expansive artists.  Disc 1 of \\"Returns\\" and disc 2 of \\"Mothership\\" combine to deliver the finest live performances in the history of the genre.  Admittedly, disc 1 of \\"Mothership\\" (for whatever reason) does start out sounding a bit labored with the updated version of \\"Medieval Overture\\".  Unexplainable considering the sheer brilliance of the remainder of the album.  Like a great Major League trade, Frank Gambale and Jean-Luc Ponty more than compensate for the absence of Al DiMeola.  Gambale holds his own.  But then you hear the introduction of Ponty's violin into the rhythmic blend and all you can do is shake your head in joyful disbelief at the mystically adventuresome results.  The dueling solos between Ponty and Chick Corea on \\"School Days\\" highlight the best live recording of Stanley Clarke's signature song ever heard.  It's unbelievable.  Moreover, it's a musical privilege to revel in it.<br /><br />The highlight amid countless highlights for me was Stanley Clarke's solo on \\"After the Cosmic Rain\\".  I've been a Stanley Clarke fan for nearly forty years.  I buy the good stuff and the bad stuff like he's a relative.  I've marveled over the decades as he's added new innovations to his Hall of Fame finger arsenal.  It's been like enjoying 40 years of a mythical version of Michael Jordan growing and expanding without diminish of his core brilliance.  Then in one single marvelous solo Stanley unleashes a fresh career's summation of power, virtuosity, speed, beauty and passion the likes of which I'd never heard before.  I'm just getting to the point where I can listen to it without getting emotional thanking God I lived long enough to hear the world's greatest bass player play out so magnificently!  It was similar to that moment during Chick's acoustic \\"Senor Mouse\\" piano solo on \\"Forever\\" where you're having that Moses moment staring into the burning bush of jazz perfection.<br /><br />If you love boundless musical artistry in the hands of the most dominant and creative virtuosos of the last half century, this live album is the joy of the craft.<br /><br />Oh,and Happy Birthday Stanley!  Can't wait for what comes next.
B007UQ5Z1G|4.0|Without any introduction, I'll get straight to what you want to know.  If you enjoyed \\"Hybrid Theory\\" and \\"Meteora\\", you most likely WILL like \\"Living Things\\".  However, don't misinterpret that statement to say this is a \\"throwback\\" album.  That would, believe it or not, sell it short.  This is Linkin Park finally settling on what their band is going to sound like after seven years of what seems like mostly flailing around randomly.  And while that sound most likely won't be exactly what you wanted, I think most of the nu-metal crowd will appreciate it.<br /><br /> At the same time, there's enough here to convince listeners that Linkin Park didn't spend the last two albums merely throwing ideas at the ceiling to see what sticks.  The lighter ballads are here off of \\"Minutes to Midnight\\", but less contrived and much more listenable.  The heavy emphasis on electronics from \\"A Thousand Suns\\" makes an appearance as well, but without that albums disorganized and schizophrenic feel.  The band has clearly taken a look back, found what did and didn't work, and managed to fuse it all into a coherent whole.<br /><br /> And what's amazing is that this album does it so well.  This is a balanced album, that doesn't devolve into unchanneled aggression, nor peters out into soft nothingness.  There's a clear order to the album, and every song has its place as the manic energy of the early tracks pulls back in favor of gentler moments, to return in full force once the cathartic moments are over.  In contrast to the random chaos of \\"A Thousand Suns\\", this is a major step forward.  Mike Shinoda is back rapping like he never has before, and Chester Bennington has returned to screaming his lungs out on a regular basis.  At the same time, both of them can sing gently when called to do so, and they do this better than any previous album Linkin Park has ever published.  This is a fusion of style like \\"Hybrid Theory\\" could only dream of.<br /><br /> This isn't to say the album is perfect.  There's a disappointing lack of guitars in almost all the tracks.  In fact, off the top of my head, I can only remember hearing any during the track \\"Victimized\\".  I don't remember hearing a serious riff in any other song.  Drums, yes.  Guitar, no.  And like almost all of Linkin Park's material, the lyrics tend to be half-baked.  Don't get me wrong, they've come a long way from \\"SHUT UP WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU!!\\", but there's still a lot to be desired from tracks like \\"Burn It Down\\" or \\"Lies Greed Misery\\".  The running time of 37 minutes is a slight downer as well, although I personally think short and sweet was the way to go here.<br /><br /> Nu-metal fans will probably enjoy the first half of the album the most, with tracks like \\"Lost in the Echo\\" and \\"In My Remains\\" calling to mind songs like \\"Somewhere I Belong\\" from Meteora, and \\"Lies Greed Misery\\" and \\"Victimized\\" channeling some raw aggression that will be appreciated.  People who appreciated the better ballads off of \\"Minutes to Midnight\\" will be sure to like \\"Castle of Glass\\" and \\"Roads Untraveled\\".  The latter is by far the most insightful Linkin Park has ever been, with themes of moving on from paths in life that did not work out or were unreachable.  \\"Until it Breaks\\" is a decent song that tries to hold on to some of the avant-garde flavor of \\"A Thousand Suns\\", and largely succeeds.  In short, this album has it all, and nearly all of it is good stuff.<br /><br /> Yes, there are a couple duds.  Ironically, the big single \\"Burn It Down\\", seems to be one of the weakest tracks: blandly written, and mostly blending in behind the adjacent tracks.  \\"I'll Be Gone\\" suffers the same fate.  \\"Skin to Bone\\" might be the same way, although I suspect it simply didn't appeal to me personally.  It has a unique (for the album) electronic style to it, full of heavy bass drops, not unlike more aggressive dubstep artists such as Skrillix.<br /><br /> Any criticisms fade into the background, though, when you listen to the album as a whole, and realize that this could be the best album Linkin Park has ever produced.  \\"Hybrid Theory\\" and \\"Meteora\\" were fun listens, but stripped of their aggression, they left little impact lyrically or compositionally.  \\"A Thousand Suns\\" was ambitious and - in places - inspired, but lacked any meaningful direction.  And despite having several great songs on it, \\"Minutes to Midnight\\" was simply an extremely weak album in general.  With \\"Living Things\\", Linkin Park seems to have finally hammered out their flaws, and constructed an album that defines them.um as a whole, and realize that this could be the best album Linkin Park has ever produced.  \\"Hybrid Theory\\" and \\"Meteora\\" were fun listens, but stripped of their aggression, they left little impact lyrically or compositionally.  \\"A Thousand Suns\\" was ambitious and - in places - inspired, but lacked any meaningful direction.

0345803485|3.0|I happily dove into this book and waited and waited for a plot to develop. Initially the sex scenes were interesting but then it just got old... Will not be wasting my time on the other books in the series..
B002NPY7FE|4.0|This was a good movie. Hadn't seen it before so I decided to get it and check it out. Follows the book pretty well, was not disappointing.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love spider. there are ads when yu start up new games I click out of them..easy. I would definitely worth the free download.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|A totally unique fun game. I always only get free apps. Don't deny a lot of you don't do the same. After I played this free version, I HAVE to buy the full version.
0345803485|2.0|Three words to start off.  Worst.  Book.  Ever.<br />I could have written this nonsense in my Junior High School Creative Writing Class.  If I had to read one more lip bite, rolling of eyes, frowning, thinning of lips, grabbing hair, or Ana saying \\"Oh my,\\" I think I would have puked.  Won't be reading any of the other sequels to this waste of time.  If the book was this bad, I can only imagine how much worse the movie will be........
B002RT69QQ|5.0|My old card reader (not one like this)finally gave up the ghost and fell apart.  This one seems to be well made and works like a charm. Small and easy to use.  I'd recommend.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|*ADD ME :  BEBEx84<br /><br />I gift back &amp; tip a lot !  I use this game on kindle fire now so had to start over... addicting!
B0086700CM|3.0|when i play it never jumps for me and i end up dieing every time i play.but it is a pretty fun game.
B000006NPY|5.0|Like many other SP fans, I discovered them through Siamese Dream and because Disarm was such a huge hit on MTV. But after hearing that CD, I found it uneven but still very good. After Mellon Collie, I was blown away by many of the songs in it and thought that was destined to be their reference album, their masterpiece.  But with Adore, I really started thinking of Billy Corgan as one of the best musicians in music, alongside with Martin L. Gore (Depeche Mode), Thom Yorke (Radiohead), Brian Molko (Placebo), Bono (U2), Michael Stipe and many others. He took SP sound and lyrics to a whole different level. Astonishingly produced and arranged, incredibly written and played.  Some songs resemble Depeche Mode in \\"Ultra\\" and \\"Songs of Faith and Devotion\\" (Pug), others sound like New Order (Apple + Oranges), but most of them are uniquely SP. Truly a Masterpiece that's going to be even more acclaimed in the future as usual.<br />Glad to know that he is still writing songs and maintaining the level of quality with the newest Oceania.<br />Definetely, one of the great bands in whole Rock History and Adore one of the great rock albums ever.
B000JMLFLW|4.0|love this classic!!! only, what's with the incomplete names/titles? eg: ----shire ? I've read my grans' copy of this and it did not have those....
B00004WZYH|1.0|Yes I was excited to purchase this item as I had experienced a difficult time finding this in commercial rental options. This WOULD have been a great find...only IT WAS ONLY PLAYABLE IN SOUTH AFRICA!!! Nothing on the purchase site told me this and alternate options when put into a PC to sync gave me the UK...I live in the US...Thanks Amazon
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a great app, a little confusing at first but once you figure it out its a  breeze. all the games are silly and fun and are a great time waster for you and your family
B0063IH60K|5.0|the classic card game everyone loves is very simple and easy to play. this app is perfect to just pass the time.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is so much fun. I love it! It has so many games and so far I havent found a single one I don't like!
0345403959|1.0|Let me start by saying this isn't a one start rant due to the book not being available on kindle. This is a one start rant because Del Rey let a great book go to print, in paperback, missing three chapters, literally goes from chapter 45 and jumps to chapter 49. This isn't Amazon's problem, but if the publishers released the book for kindle, maybe I'd have gotten my $7.99 worth!
B0036EH3WU|5.0|Great full package with DVD's and extras for the true LOST fan. Cool collector box and extra material from the cast and crew. Something you would want to keep as a collectors item. Completely satisfied.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|it is one of the best games I have EVER played.  I know two dollars is a lot but its worth it GET THIS APP
030758836X|4.0|I honestly did not know what I was getting myself into when I read this book. Gillian Flynn is an excellent writer and the book more than proves this.<br /><br />The premiss of the book is great and has so many twists and turns that keep the reader guessing and switching allegiances with frequency. Unlike other reviewers I did not find the ending disappointing. I thought the author wrapped the book up well.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|-this is my favorite game now! how ever it freezes on the third level so that needs to be fixed but other than that best game evr! i luv u lep's world!
B00785P2QC|4.0|very good game overall. only downside is that you need invest points to expand the city. also if you don't have facenook you're at a disadvantage because it will give invest points for sharing, liking, and posting.
B0086700CM|4.0|this is such a good game and I play it a lot out of all the other ones I have u should get it!!!!!!!!<br /><br />IT IS SO MUCH FUN AND REALLY WORTH IT!!!!!!!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love the cat and dog chocies. there so cute. I have cat 1 as the back of my card.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it cause it has a lot of games and because we have to beat the game unordered to unlock more
B005LAIH3G|3.0|I had seen both the bad and good reviews, but thought we would give it a chance anyway.  I have to commend them on the special effects, but the story and acting was vapid and rather boring.  I wanted to like the movie, but will probably not bother watching it again.
0385737955|1.0|Wife and I both read it and both agreed it was horrible.  It was a recommended read after Hunger Games.  Compared to that wonderful series this was just awful.  About 100 pages from the end I guessed what the end plot was and thought to my self \\"no, it couldn't possibly be that dumb.\\"  But it was.  I won't spoil it but the entire reason for this MASSIVE expenditure of resources is just pathetic and absolutely would not happen.  They could have learned the same thing about the kids with ZERO effort or expense.  The puzzle is awful, the characters are ok but not terribly engaging or deep.  The ending was a huge let down.<br /><br />One last thing.<br />Armored slugs.<br />Not scary and not cool.
B002DU39S0|5.0|Ordered for my granddaughter.  She loves it. Has watched it several times.  Have bought several dvds. Will continue to buy more.
B004SBBDB2|5.0|I purchased these for when I travel. I have an apple TV and needed something for when I'm on the go.  It works with my iPhone 4, first gen iPad, and third gen iPad as well.  Better price than the apple ones cannot complain.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I CANNOT WAIT FOR THE 3RD SEASON TO START. THIS PRODUCT LEFT ME WANTING TO WATCH MORE EPISODES.<br />THE BEST SHOW I HAVE EVER WATCHED.
B003L77G38|4.0|Everything was as described.  It came in time.  There was nothing wrong with it at all.<br />It was nice having the product I purchased arrive in time and being what I expected.
0439023521|5.0|I heard of the Hunger Games while in school. A few classmates talked about how interesting it was, though at the time it was just a title to me, nothing more. I never picked up the book, too busy or simply not interested enough. The title of the book sounded odd, confusing me as to what it could possibly be about though that curiosity didnt pick up, until I saw that it was going to be a new upcoming movie.<br /><br />Yes, just like the terror of Twilight, I feared that this book, now turned into a movie would be just as terrible, if not worse. Knowing that it was fairly popular already, especially with my peers, I worried that the hype of the movie would also in turn ruin the books. Despite all of this, I simply had to watch the film. Heading in with a skeptical point of view, I sat next to a friend who had already read the books, and prepared myself for the worst.<br /><br />Alas! I was very very surprised. The movie was fabulous, the concept I simply swooned over. After watching the movie and reading the first book, I am extremely happy that I picked it up; even though delayed. I have never cried while reading before, though just as I did while watching the film, certain moments caused me to tear up while reading as well.<br /><br />The back-story is much better explained in the book (of course) and I absolutely love the creativity put into it. Minor details did annoy me however. How Katniss despised her mother so severely for the way she had dealt with certain situations (not wanting to give away spoilers here), which to me made it seem like she was generalizing woman as weak. She was also fairly condescending in that manner, which also peeved me; but with that all aside, the characters I did enjoy, and the suspense during the games was thrilling. I would recommend this book to anyone. ^^
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very fun time consumer.  really good when shitting.  helps pass the time. currently.deployed to Afghanistan so its much appreciated too
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I luv this app! this is just like a Mario game but a leprechaun!!! its so fun to play with so many levels!! it does get boring when you keep doing the.same level but otherwise its so AWESOME!!!!!! the lep is so cute!!! I could rate this game a million stars if I could!

B007L6VR6M|5.0|Just in from seeing Moonrise kingdom in theaters and I loved it. As all Wes Anderson movies it is very smart, fast and funny. I really enjoyed each character and all the actors really put a lot into their performance.<br /><br />Of Wes Anderson's films I would say The Life Aquatic and the Royal Tenenbaums are my favorite. Moonrise Kingdom would be next. I liked the younger cast as they really put a different spin on the story, as even with adult themes they pulled it off with tastefulness. There also is an interesting link between the adults and the children as each of there interactions are mirrored in the others story.<br /><br />It is a very solid movie, well written and very well directed. Wes is at the top of his game. The soundtrack was also outstanding, as it is in most of his films.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00000DATR|1.0|I have over 230 CDs from many different artists (including Mike Oldfield).  This is the ONLY one that will not read on a computer because of the NAZI security features!  I am a huge Mike Oldfield fan but I cannot transfer this to my mp3 player like every other CD I own.  I can't even buy an mp3 of this album!  Complete BS!  Nothing wrong with making mp3's if it is for my own personal use (no sharing). Wish I had never purchased this!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This app offers a variety of short games.  It is a great way to kill a little time during a break.
142311339X|4.0|I'm a huge Percy Jackson fan so, I was looking forward to reading this book. The book itself reminded me a lot of The Lightning Thief but was nowhere near as fun. The book has a good and interesting plot and i enjoyed it but there was something wrong... the characters. I just couldn't get to like our new hero, Jason. He seemed a little off, maybe plain.He  also  had way too much special treatment from everyone!!  I liked Piper and Leo but I still didn't fell in love with them like I did with the characters from PJ. Another setback for me was that the characters way of thinking was childish. It didn't felt like they were teens, it was more  like they were 12( which is why I said it reminded of the first PJ book). The book itself was good, I enjoyed it, especially the funny parts with Leo and Coach Hedge, but these two things keep me from loving it. I just hope that the next book will overcome this setbacks but, even if it does change no  character can or will be able to replace  the PJ characters I came to love.
B000J5XS3C|2.0|I carefully reviewed the manual available on-line, and initially purchased the 5-input version of this mixer, only to find that the manual was incorrect, and didn't bother to mention the 502 was the only one in the line that did NOT have a switch for phantom power. (Doesn't matter a lot if you have a dynamic microphone, but it's pretty d*mned important if you plan to plug a ribbon mic into it as the phantom power can severely damage the element! My query to customer support was initially answered that it didn't matter, and subsequent follow-ups were ignored.) After returning the 502, I bought the 802, and now have the switch the manual clearly noted across the entire line, along with a bunch of other inputs I don't need and a somewhat lighter wallet.<br /><br />It works fine as a cheap mic preamp and mini-mixer, but it wasn't worth the hassle and the delay caused by purchasing the wrong device after researching based on inaccurate paperwork. I wish now I had purchased a mic pre-amp from another manufacturer, one that has a customer support team worthy of the name. Truth is, after the disappointing experience of the last week-and-change with this company and their \\"support,\\" I wish I had never purchased anything from them.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|It's a lot like Mario.  I have enjoyed playing this game on the Kindle Fire. If you like Mario, you should try this game.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I've used several Headsets over the years (primarily for gaming, however music and other media use also).  From top shelf planetronics sets to $8 Wal Mart Specials.  I was concerned with this being cordless.  I refuse to use wireless keyboards or mice because it interferes/interrupts gaming.  This headset is amazing.  Set up is plug and play, the software is nifty, and being freed from the chains of a cord hanging from your head is awesome.  You can wear these things away from your desk, be listening to whatever you are into, use the mic, and do it around the corner in the kitchen for example.<br /><br />All of that being said you occassionally get a hiccup in the connection.  However, its brief, doesnt happen that often, so its forgiven.  Its not frequent, doesnt last more than a second or two, and being as easily annoyed at these types of things as I can be it doesnt effect me in the slightest.  The freedom from a wire and the excellent quality more than make up for brief lapses.  I only mention it because if you are going to spend $100 on a headset (not my first time) you should know exacly what you are getting.  Its worth every penny.  Highly recommend.
1468161660|5.0|What an amazing book.  You will laugh, cry, fall in love, and cry some more.  I finished the book in half a day - was not able to put it down.  I can't wait to read vol. 2 and I sure hope the main characters stay together till the end.
0439023513|4.0|Inspired by the Greek myth of Theseus and the Minotar, in which children of Athens are sacrificed to a monster in his Labrynth, The Hunger Games trilogy explores war and morality, trust and betrayal, and as Susan Carpenter of the LA Times wrote, \\"teenage rage against the cruel and arbitrary power of the adult world.\\"<br /><br />We send our children to fight our battles. It is on the television news every night. None return unscathed and of course many do not return. Those who do are, like Katniss and Peeta, scarred for life. The youth of Panem are put in the most outrageous deadly situations to fight for their lives in the Arena. Only one can survive at the end. To the young men and women at arms, how much different is a Hunger Games Arena from the mountains of Afganistan or the rice paddies of Vietnam?<br /><br />Mockingjay picks up the pace of The Hunger Games story after the 2nd book, Catching Fire, tapered off on action and character development, leaving this reader a bit disappointed. Mockingjay has surprises and plot points that keep the reader engaged and the story moving forward, even accelerating. The ending is both a surprise and a let down. That is ok since it is realistic and believable. To this reader, that is a mark of respect by an author for his or her readers. The epilogue is also true to life, although some professional critics dislike it.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins combines an amazing variety of perspectives on history, character and our society in this book. Like a mockingjay, this story tells us what we already know. It does so in a powerful and poignant way that makes us question why we think any dispute is worth killing our children over.<br /><br />I wonder if The Hunger Games will change the world?
B005LAIGSM|1.0|I read the book and about the only thing it has in common with the movie is the Title!  I was very disappointed with it and wish I would not have bought it and been satisfied with the book, oh well, seldom can they ever compare to the book.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I think this game is addicting and fun. Making your own city. What makes the game more fun is that they are objectives to complete and get a reward for doing it. The only thing that stinks is that you need a Facebook account for a couple of objectives and you can pay money for credit points and city credits if you want more. Overall it is a good app.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I downloaded this app for my kindle fire and I love it. I lost so many<br />Hours of free time to this game because I just couldn't stop playing it! Well done. Very nice game. Buy it! All of you!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book seems like it was written by a teenager, however i did come to like the book at the end.  The author tells whats happening and thats not something an author should/usually do and i found it irritating. But now I am hooked and going to read the next book just to see what happens. But i don't really see how this is a bestselling book at all, where was the editor?
B007I2BZIE|5.0|First, we can all admit that this album lacks a huge timeless rock anthem, like Rush's classic hit \\"Tomlight of Radiheart\\".<br /><br />Having said that, this is still Rush's best album. Ever.<br /><br />CA has a combination of mature vision with youthful creativity. There are moments of almost sweet melody (\\"The Wreckers\\"), moments of driving melody (\\"The Anarchist\\"), and moments of blazing rock (\\"BU2B\\"). There are catchy riffs you 'get' on the first hearing (\\"7 Cities of Gold\\"), and walls of sound that take several listens to appreciate (\\"Headlong Flight\\"). There are straightforward power-trio sections (\\"Caravan\\") and ethereal moments that take you to another world (\\"BU2B2\\" & \\"Clockwork Angels\\"). Best of all, there is a work of art that ends the album too amazing to just be called a song; it's titled \\"The Garden\\" and is the best possible summation of the CA story any musicians could've composed.<br /><br />Every song is strong, and there is no filler. Easily 5 stars.
B0086700CM|3.0|the game was fun at first then all of sudden it wouldn't let me open the app. its really fun if it doesn't just stop working all the sudden.
0545265355|4.0|I love to read. These books are easy to see the words.<br />I saw the movie before I read the books, Now i'm reading thse before<br />the rest of the movies come. the books are hard to put down once you start<br />reading them.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is a awsome game that nobody will forget and never be afraid to let it go. In other words<br />it iscthe best game ever know to all.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Love love love to play this during down time - easy but challenging - definitely a must get!!! A variety of layouts to play!
B003MVJG8Q|2.0|I bought the Transcend USB 3.0 PCIe Adapter so that I could get USB3 support on my desktop PC (32 bit, Windows 7).<br /><br />The PCIe bus does not supply enough power for powering most external hard disk drives (or charging phones) as a \\"real\\" USB3 port would. They get around it is by using an internal power connector, which works fine (the same that you used to use for IDE devices. You can see the socket for it in the photo, on the top edge of the card).<br /><br />Alas, the card is buggy as heck. Every time I boot my system, the card would not start. I have to explicitly go into the device manager, disable the card, and re-enable it, at which point it works right away. Seeing that it cannot possibly be a resource conflict (otherwise the card wouldn't start just from disabling and re-enabling it in the device message, in addition, the PC has no other devices connected than a printer, keyboard and mouse, with a graphic PCIe card), I call this a bug.<br />Now, I am used to devices having all sorts of bugs, requiring all sorts of tricks and tweaks to get to work, from fighting with the XServer, DOS and whatnot in 1995. However, this is 2012. Plug and Play has been around for 17 years! Save your money and buy a different card that doesn't require this kind of workaround. I am giving this card two stars (one for working, and one for reaching USB3 speeds), but I cannot recommend it at all. I'll live with it, but if I had to get someone a USB3 card, I'd search for a different brand.
0679805273|5.0|I bought this to give to my son one day when he graduates high school. The book came in perfect condition. It's a hard cover book with a book slip and I love the message!
B0063IH60K|5.0|its a good game to help pass time I Rlly enjoy trying to beat my own score. I would deft recommend this app
0811876373|5.0|I've followed bakerella's blog forever so i was super excited when i found out she was coming out with a book. I ordered it for my little sister and I immediately since we're obsessed with cake pops. This book is great! it has cake pop ideas for every occasion as well as how to make the cake pops and homemade ingredients and what flavors go well with what.i love it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|get and play.  you will enjoy.  easy to play and hours of mindless fun.  take a break and play to get away.
B007UXSDYU|1.0|seems like it my go somewhere....but it never does. sad, depressing, disgusting. I thought w/ some bigger name actors for this sort of movies it might be ok. i was wrong. a lot of questions gone unanswered, and a horrible plot line. And I watched the whole thing :)
B004QL7K6G|5.0|I am quite shocked this movie has gotten such bad reviews. I laughed so hard I cried! It's just another laid back comedy that just makes you laugh. All the actors were great and I think they complemented each other well. It's been a while since a comedy has come out that I laughed so hard I cried and this one definitely made that happen. I guess it really depends on people's humor but I love to laugh! The more ridiculous the better!
0679720200|5.0|I love a good story, and especially a story that has a deeper purpose. Camus' novel is just that. The whole existence of the main character is a series of events that seem disjointed, but through the novel, you begin to see his life is one meaningless event after another one. We are invited to look at a man who has nothing but the experience of the moment. Nothing is meaningful, and nothing is meaningless, it just is. The sorrow and hollowness that come from this type of existence are palpable. In the end, Mersault becomes exactly what his life has been. A great book to read with other people and discuss.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|not recamended for kids who have other much more fun apps.  boring. mildly entertaining for5 seconds. poor graphics. crudley done.
0439023521|5.0|I had my doubts about this book at first. Being a 36 year old male, I wondered if I was being sucked into some over dramatized teenage love story, but I was pleasantly surprised. The book is well done and well written. The character development is outstanding, and although Katniss is not a typical protagonist, she grows on you as the reader, and you start to feel the weight of her burden.  I love the dystopian feel of the novel, and the picture of human depravity that is portrayed here. This is one worth reading!
0345803493|5.0|It was fun and easy to read. It gives readers a small view of a hidden world. I loved it. Worth the money and time.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Dragged on and on, a silly romantic story where girl meets boy who is almost the perfect man.  Sex scenese were too much and not all that exciting.
0345803507|5.0|It was fun and easy to read. It gives viewers a small view of a whole hidden world. It was worth the money and the time. I loved it.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I really enjoy this take on Holmes.  He is played with a nice mix of the arrogant know-it-all and the totally clueless who's been caught off guard.  Like anyone with a mental illness (\\"I'm not a psychopath Anderson.  I'm a high-functioning sociopath.\\"), he is either incapable of understanding why some of his actions are inappropriate, or is frightened when he does understand.<br /><br />I've watched a couple of episodes with a friend who has ADHD.  He does *not* stop talking.  With \\"Sherlock\\", he has very little to say while watching.  Could it possibly do the same for all with ADHD?
B002BJGYU8|5.0|I don't have much to say about the show or this season box set except that it is amazing! The show is really well-written in my opinion, and I think this season keeps all the awesomeness of the first season. Lots of pop culture references that are nicely placed in the quick wit and conversation. And, for your convenience, this DVD boxset of season 2 has an insert called \\"Gilmore-isms\\" which lists all the pop culture references within the show (not sure if a complete list, but had all the ones I didn't recognize and looked up in this booklet insert). All in all, very satisfied with this DVD boxset of Season 2 of the Gilmore Girls.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I never thought that i would like this type of book, it captured me from the start and had to read the Trilogy.  A good read.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I am so glad that I took a chance on this book. Kudos to C.Hoover for such an awesome writing! Definitely a must-read, a page-turner and a wholesome book. Love, love it!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|this app is varry fun and it lets you edit photos in every way.I wish I could rate this higher.It is also fun when your board.Do get app!
0786955570|5.0|Even if you hate fourth edition, I think you will like this board game.  For those old school players who don't have the time anymore for traditional DnD, this is a really fun, well thought out and elegant distilling of what made pen and paper role playing great in the first place.  With no pen and paper required!
B007U1FEJE|4.0|The Beach Boys<br /><br />That's Why God Made The Radio (2012)<br /><br />Being their first new studio album (and with Brian Wilson) in many years, this album has all the wonderful harmonies one would expect from The Beach Boys.  There is nothing groundbreaking or profound here, but it is a very enjoyable release.  This may not be among their very best, but any fan of The Beach Boys will enjoy it.  This release is promising enough to make one hope that they will make a few more albums (and not wait too long to do so).<br />This is a solid Four Star release.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|After this album I am a total lover of the Black Keys! I like the fact that every one of their albums has a different and unique sound, but still sounding like themselves. The first album I bought was Attack and Release, which is good but not my fave. The next one I bought was El Camino which I loved and then Brothers which I also love. Brothers has a bluesy, sexy, yet funky sound that is addictive to listen to. I highly recommend this album to anyone, go buy today, you will not be disappointed!
B0000DBJ2B|5.0|The best fairy tales are for any age is the adage, and this is an immersive work of puppet creations bringing to life an unique reality of epic mystical proportions.<br /><br />This alternative dimension is out of balance, the Skeksis are incurably vile and the Mystics in-purtable in their long lost wisdom. Then there are the surviving Gelf-lings (a kind of elve), a hazy prophecy, and the fun and hi-jinx of an mysterious quest not fully revealed.<br /><br />The art and verve in bring this all to life in real puppet performance being blended with the craft of mime-art is much fun.<br /><br />Definitely a film fantasy classic for any fan of the Genre & the more un-touched fairy tale movie story in general.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The Avengers was truly an outstanding superhero movie. Plenty of action, well-definted characters, and a story line that was fairly interesting. In my opinion, Ironman and the Hulk stole the show. Very entertaining stuff to watch with a group of friends and a big bowl of popcorn.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|Received it and is by far the best 200 dollars i have ever spent. A buddy of mine who is deployed told me about this devices for systems so i did my research and i wish i would have found this sooner. I have already been deployed once and now that i have this gaems g155 i can take it with me on my next deployment to Afghanistan. I have my ps3 in it right now and it play beautifully. For the people who are wondering, with the Xbox 360 i got 720 out of it and with the ps3 it plays 1080i. You can ask for anything better given the size of the case. To the people who make this, amazing job, there is no better way to keep yourself entertained especially since everything is at your disposal like this. I start my deployment soon and thanks to you guys who make this gaems g155 device i am well prepared. Thanks again. 5 Stars!!!!!
B007MNV5WU|3.0|I don't hate it and don't not like it, BUT I think I like the free version with prompt updates on my phone better. After reading reviews, I'm NOT buying this!
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|the game is really fun but it keeps crashing it would be very very helpfull if you could please fix
B0081L37Z0|1.0|I find it hard to believe anyone would call this a movie.  Garbage, i love summer trash movies but this doesn't even leave the crap yard.  Save your money,
B0086DBE62|2.0|First of all, let me list the good qualities about this movie.<br />  The graphics are really cool on this movie, and the \\"mirror mirror\\" parts are really awesome to watch. Plus, some of the fighting sequences are entertaining.<br /><br />Now for the bad things.<br />  The writers of this film completely turned the story around, and the lessons about true TRUE love in the original are wiped out in this movie. Instead of being masculine, and courageous, the prince is feminine, and Snow White ends up fighting for herself. The dwarves are made out to be thieves, and Snow White joins them, and the spells and enchantments, which I normally like, are too wichcrafty for my taste. Overall, I would recommend to NOT buy this.
1594744475|5.0|When our teen wanted to make bento for his birthday present, we were at a loss.  This book has taught him everything he needs to know to make lunches for himself and his friends.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This app is awesome. Makes me think and the expert puzzles are challenging. Haven't played anything else since I downloaded this app. No problems at all encountered.
B007MU85D0|5.0|I feel in love with OMAM (it's a bit of a band name to spell out!) when I first heard Little Talks on the radio, on a little drive out back in February. It was so rich both vocally and instrumentally, and, well, full of life and full of love. It was a matter of months later before it crossed my mind to get my mitts on a copy of the album, and what a decision, too! I'm so glad I did. This entire album is such a little privilege to have and to listen to. It seems the gamut of emotions is run over the course of its playing, from sadness to joy and their relatives too, and it just plain sounds bloody good.<br />Forgive me if I step out of line with my comparisons and labels here, but it's a beautifully folksy sound at work here, and it no doubt brings to mind Mumford and Sons. It's music to open your heart right up to -- I dare you. It's most frequently used as the soundtrack to my downtime, or driving, or conducting myself in the kitchen. Little Talks stands up beautifully to the rest of the tracks, too; other heartfelt favorites include Dirty Paws (a textbook way to open an album like this), Mountain Sound (that chorus!), From Finner, Your Bones, and Lakehouse. For starters. My Head Is An Animal, however, is really to be treated more than a sum of its parts, song inclinations aside. It's an overall hour of something savory for the ears and the mind and heart.
B007U1FEJE|4.0|Why do we follow the Beach Boys?  The story has stayed interesting for 50 years.<br /><br />Here are the points:<br /><br />~ Young genius Brian.<br />~ Family band lead by an abusive father.<br />~ America's only answer to the Beatles.<br />~ Brian's mental breakdown.<br />~ Glenn Campbell then Bruce.<br />~ Father gets fired, then sells Brian's music.<br />~ Pet Sounds--historical album.<br />~ SMiLE--the most legendary unfinished album.<br />~ LSD and mental collapse of Brian.<br />~ Sunflower--an emergency collection.<br />~ Charles Manson and Dennis.<br />~ Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.<br />~ Dennis Wilson has the stuff.<br />~ Ricky Faatar and Blondie Chapman.<br />~ 70's music is a step ahead of everyone--not popular but best stuff.<br />~ Brother music.<br />~ Dennis and Christie McVie.<br />~ Dennis buried at sea.<br />~ Rolling Stone band of the 70's--the Beach Boys.<br />~ Interior Secretary and the Mall in DC.<br />~ Regans make things right.<br />~ Brian is back--for the first time.<br />~ Shrink Eugene Landy takes complete control of Brian.  (And probably saves him--shades of gray.)<br />~ SNL takes Brian out of bed and to the beach.<br />~ Carl goes to court to take charge of Brian.<br />~ Kokomo--surprise hit for Mike. (Don't forget Wipe Out.)<br />~ Carl, the glue and the band's heart, dies.<br />~ Everyone sues.<br />~ Brian goes solo.<br />~ Beach Boys in 3 different acts.<br />~ Country music and Beach Boys sound good.<br />~ Brian's daughters have the stuff.<br />~ Brian is truly back, and on stage.<br />~ SMiLE finished.<br />~ Brian has great new stuff--does not chart.<br />~ SMiLE sessions and Pacific Ocean Blue celebrated.<br />~ 50 year aniversary album is surprisingly good.<br />~ David Marks redeemed.<br />~ Album is number 3 on charts. Boys are all around age 70.<br />~ Future--Dennis movie and Brian movie.<br />(I hope I didn't miss anything.)<br /><br />It comes down to the music, and the Beach Boys have more to discover than any other band.Do you know Brian and his daughter's cut an album?  Do you know Carl and a couple of friends released an album after he passed?  Have you listened to Brian's 3 unreleased albums? SMiLE and Bambu are now avaliable. The Beach Boys owned a studio and used it--there are hours of music to listen to.<br /><br />The Endless Summer album got me hooked when I was 8.<br /><br />Recently, we were told a new Beach Boy album of all new stuff would be released.  It will sound like Pet Sounds.  Good.<br /><br />I had to buy it--I am a fanatic after all.  But I was ready to take what was there.  It would be interesting.<br /><br />Now, I play it because it is good music.  Like with Dennis's Pacific Ocean Blue--I bought it out of interest, and now I listen to it because it is good...really.<br /><br />The story continues...<br /><br />Smart people have done revues.  Here are my thoughts about the new album:<br /><br />~ Brian is singing better on this album than I have maybe ever heard him.  His voice is weathered, but the emotion and delivery are spot on.  He still has the falsetto, but he mainly blends it with the harmony.  Listen to the final track...it is beautiful.<br />~ Brian seems to be more into this music.  Having the guys back seems to have rejuvenated his interest. It warms your heart. We all need our people.<br />~ Al Jardine's lead on From There to Back Again is his best ever.  Name one better.  The years have seasoned his classic rock lead.<br />~ Mike Love is not a villain--he is the adult in the room.  He said past problems occurred when the Wilsons took drugs and the rest of the band did not.  Can you argue with that? The history is pretty clear.<br />~ Mike must have swallowed a lot of pride to get the band back together.  I do not see him as a villain.  He is pragmatic. The result of this album should be proof.<br />~ The old Boys have young guys helping them out with vocals--what is the problem with that?  Do you want a weak sound and poor product?  This is aprofessional outfit.  You will get a quality production from the Beach Boys--get over it.<br />~ Mike's voice is a bit weak--he is 71 years old.  When I play the album, people cannot believe he is that old.<br />~ The Beach Boys are doing the same old harmony routine.  Do you really expect hip hop from these guys?  Drop the stupid criticism.  This is Beach Boy music.  Some is Pet Sounds music.<br />~ The last 3 songs are the best--they are not pop, they are quality musical experiences that do not need to be defined.  They make me cry.<br />~ Sorry Brian and Boys, I still want more.<br /><br />Stevesmid.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is so cool and awesome. best game I've ever played. but you have to unlock some of the games.

B004TI5N38|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed David Baldacci's Zero Day.  As I have learned to trust this author not to pepper profanity throughout his books, especially avoiding the F... word.  The plot, action, and character's were very enjoyable.  Thanks, once again for delivering a wonderful thriller!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love dis game. i also have da kindle fire n have no problems once so ever getting out. good way to past time.
B006P3HXZG|5.0|I have seen this movie several times on the big screen and now on my not so big screen at home. SUPER GREAT movie, I wish I could give more stars, very funny movie that makes you feel good and happy, the type of movie that should be made more often. I recommend it very highly!!
1594202842|4.0|A fascinating, easy-to-read, honest look into one family's life, as written from the mother's perspective. Anyone who thinks this is a parenting book or advice about how to raise their children is missing the point completely, in my opinion. Ms. Chua is talking about her ideas, her values, her cultural expectations. Yes, she thinks they're better than yours (if you're Western), but you undoubtedly think your ideas are better than hers.<br /><br />There's no doubt that Ms. Chau's forceful nature and intense involvement caused her children to excel in so many ways. However, living with the author sounds like hell on earth, and I kept wondering what part her husband was playing in all this Chinese parenting. (She does say at the end of the book that she took out nearly every section having to do with Jed.) I also wondered how the author could possibly maintain her schedule with the children in addition to teaching, writing, and lecturing for her own career. I found it interesting that Ms. Chua was so firm in her convictions that Chinese parenting was the best and only way despite the fact that it was wrong for her father (who turned out to be tremendously successful but completely divorced from his own family), that she floundered with her own career choices (driven and successful yet initially unhappy and lost professionally), and that it was clearly the wrong tactic with Lulu. Even her own parents encouraged her to try a different approach, which seems to have only made her dig in harder. Ms. Chua's a stubborn parent with tunnel vision - that's obvious enough.<br /><br />So no, I have no desire to parent like her, and I don't think she's encouraging me to. I admire the book because it's so honest, so easy to read, and so well written. I'm glad I read it.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|Love this book! I have honestly read it about 5 times since I bought it at the beginning of this year I read it in one day! I could not put it down! Definitely can't wait for the next one to come out. It's a great love story and blows twilight out of the water! :)
B006PHD0RW|5.0|game is fast paced and addictive.  new scenes opening up provide additional motivation to keep playing. The game offers choices of which scenes to play and you can replay scenes for a higher score.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I have a love / hate relationship with this book. While I was annoyed slightly by the dialogue (even in super yuppy, hipster Washington, I don't know an early 20s woman who speaks the way Ana was written to speak), I was undoubtedly intrigued by the relationship between Ana and Christian. I find myself in a relationship with a very dominant (although not the bdsm kind) man, and find it difficult, as an independent thinker, to succumb to a slightly submissive role.<br /><br />There were times when I found myself downright HATING Christian Grey, and it made it difficult to continue reading, but then was drawn back in by the realization that it was so mirroring of my relationship.<br /><br />The only other problem I had was the authors over-repetition of certain words. I probably should be more annoyed with myself for having such a keen eye for little things like that. I just felt mixing things up and using a thesaurus now and again would have been a wise choice.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed myself, and admittedly got a little hot and bothered with the extremely candid erotic scenes.<br /><br />I think I'll continue with the trilogy...but it is still up for debate right now...

B002I9Z8DK|5.0|The blu ray quality is so much better on this movie than the standard dvd.  Words can't express how much better the quality is.  The quality upgrade on this movie is why I love blu ray so much more than standard dvds!  I base my reviews on the quality of the movie in blu ray vs standard.  I don't like to talk about the actual movie.  I did like this movie a lot, but that doesn't make a difference in the quality of blu ray compared to standard.  I HATE when somebody gives a review, and talks about the movie, and not the quality of blu ray/standard.
1593082800|4.0|A friend lent us this famous novel, cited as the first full-length mystery novel ever written. To be sure, it is remarkable that a book published in 1860 has been in continuous publication ever since. A compelling story, replete with modern day twists, and delightful intriguing characters, is as winning a formula 150 years ago as it is today. Moreover, a scholarly introduction to the book (perhaps better read afterward to avoid some moderate spoilers), is full of interesting information - not the least of which is that this was also one of the first novels to narrate from the points of view of the main characters. Given the time frame of its authorship, perhaps the only detraction is the flowery and long-winded wordiness of the writing, although we found ourselves adjusting after a few dozen pages...<br /><br />The tale centers around two sisters, Marian and Laura Fairlie. Marian seems to live only for the happiness of her sibling, who falls in love with one man (her \\"drawing master\\" Walter Hartright) but marries a minor noble (Sir Percival), who of course promptly mistreats her and is out to get her money. An Italian Count (Fosco) becomes a cohort with her husband and much of the story follows the skullduggery of these two villains. Meanwhile, a third woman, Anne Catherick, who bears an interesting and amazing likeness to Laura, has escaped from an insane asylum, and claims to know some devastating secret (which of course we readers are dying to find out!) about Percival. Hartright eventually resumes a role in the proceedings; the book concludes with a number of sensational developments that both explain all and satisfy our hopes for the outcome.<br /><br />We were entertained throughout, and found the pace and suspense to increase significantly during the latter part of this 600+ page tome. It has been a long time since we have read such a classic, but would claim we were richly rewarded by a charming piece of literature.

0452289963|5.0|As author of [[ASIN:0979243548 Finding Our Way Forward: New Perspectives On Our Evolving Human Potential]], I would like to emphasize the importance of the concepts brought to us in Eckhart Tolle's work, and especially the idea that we create \\"A New Earth\\" with every moment of every day, by the way we live our lives.  I have tried in my own book to pick up where dear Eckhart has left off in this book, and to show more in detail, how this can happen in the lives of ordinary everyday people. I know I personally needed more support than this book alone gave me.  But it did serve as a fabulous starting place/jumping off place for me. A place to finally 'get' what is going on with the collapsing of the old structures in the world that don't work anymore.<br /><br />Another important take-away for me from this book was the ideas about how conflict is one of ego's primary ways that it self-protects and tries to \\"win\\" instead of opening itself to the fact of a reality that is larger than it is.  Hats off to Eckhart for having written a well articulated and life changing work. I sincerely hope that each of us who understands his message is able to go forward each day, putting our moment-to-moment lives on the line as expressions of the highest truth that we can reach. This is something that, to the best of my understanding, Tolle has done very well with his own personal life. One has always to look at whence such teachings come, and from what I can tell, Tolle's life is a wonderfully pure expression of his teaching.  Thank you Eckhart for a wonderful book.
0439023513|4.0|The book was amazing and a great ending to a fantastic trilogy. I love that the book came plastic wrapped with a strong cardboard back to prevent any damage.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|As author of [[ASIN:B008C2C7QS Finding Our Way Forward: New Perspectives on Our Evolving Human Potential]] I know the importance of not just willingness but also skillfullness in the leaving behind of old habits and making room for the new incoming patterns for lives that respond effectively to changing situations.  The times are changing so fast right now, and those who are not able to let go of the old grooves (old ways of behaving, old ways of thinking, responding, reacting)will have a lot of difficulty in being effective or happy in this ever-new world.<br /><br />Charles Duhigg does an excellent job in \\"The Power of Habit\\" of helping us understand the importance of being able to change these kind of on-the-ground, everyday habits when it becomes necessary to to so, to adjust to new situations at work and at home.  He also capably assists us in strengthening our new habit-change muscles where we maybe haven't even had them before. Thanks to his work, we can become increasingly resilient in our fast-changing world, and creative in our responses to it.
B00003CWOL|5.0|Dogma to me is one of my favorites in my movie collection.  I am Catholic but this movie made me laugh so hard in so many scenes, I was not even offended by any of the movie.  Also if anyone ask me I tell them the truth like the front of the dvd cover \\"Faith is a funny thing.\\"  That is actually true in so many ways,  I am forever a Kevin Smith fan after this movie.  So like I say typically if you need a good laugh and unwind from hard days work and unwind from life then pick this dvd up and laugh your butt off scene after scene.
0143038419|3.0|Journey of discovery on 3 continents. The style of writing reminds me of \\"The Nanny Diaries\\" - light and comedic. I am enjoying that!<br />There's been so much said about this wildly popular book. I especially enjoyed the author's self-deprecating humor, even making the most depressing things seem funny and tolerable. A good read.
B00000IQC8|4.0|Very Funny movie but... I agree with some reviwers the extras needed to be more for die hard core Kevin Smith fans.<br />Kevin Smith is one of just a few directors that I enjoy watching over and over again because I never ever get tired of his sense of humor and the actors do a great job on each and every movie he makes.<br /><br />So anyone who have ever wanted to rip into a customer watch this movie and enjoy laugh after laugh for you will not stop laughing threwout the movie experience.

1853269077|2.0|Buyers, keep in mind that this particular publication is actually a three-volume set.  The first volume is \\"all the long stories\\", the second is \\"the shorter stories, in chronological order\\", and the third is \\"all the shorter stories in chronological order after the resurrection\\".  That being said, the reason for the two-star review is that the illustrations in this publication are far to dark to discern any of the amazing details of the original artworks, which defeats the purpose of buying an \\"illustrated\\" version.  Also, it features no illustrations from either of the first two novels (from any artist).  The \\"Original Illustrated Sherlock Holmes\\" (ISBN 0890090572) publication does a far better job with the subtle monochromatic illustrations that accompanied the original Strand publications; you will be far more satisfied with it.

B005LAIGSC|4.0|First of all I do not think Denzel has ever been in a bad movie in my book.  This one is lots of action.  Story is a little weak at some points, but I don't think they were trying to make a documentary.  If you just want lots of action with a great supporting cast - this is a great rental.
0062197258|4.0|Check out the full review at Kritters Ramblings<br /><br />If a book can give you the creepies, then this one is first on my list.  I have read books where I am left on edge or wondering who dun it, but this one just made me want to check the security in our condo and make sure the dog would bark at anything other than the wind.
B008ASLK8A|3.0|Not a bad movie, just not an original movie.  If you have seen the first one you pretty much know how this one is going to go.  But they do spend the first 15 minutes of this movie wrapping up the end of the original one, so if you have not seen the original one you might be a bit confused for a while.

0671449028|5.0|Every night, just before bed, I read my daughter two stories - a random selection from her book drawer, and this book. Routine is good for little ones, and I am glad that I have made this story part of my child's bedtime routine. She loves this book. The pictures hold her attention, and the story is silly, but relatable. Bath? Check. PJ's? Check. Teeth brushed? Check. Exercises done? Okay, maybe not. But Rock, rock, rocking to sleep? Definitely! My sweet baby was just a few months old when I started reading her this book at night. We still read it now that she is 8 months, and I don't think we'll stop any time soon. Maybe someday, she'll read it to me!

B007SYWFRM|5.0|Omg this is the third time I have tried to write a review and I love the game but the stupid review section is pissing me off! let me tell you what man! grrrrr
1569242739|1.0|This book is ridiculous. As with EVERY recipe I have attempted to prepare that Isa Chandra Moskowitz has written, none of the recipes turn out properly. I am not a novice baker. I bake almost exclusively vegan and have made literally thousands of baked goods over just the past six years. That being said, every single recipe I have tried from this book ( vanilla cupcakes, crimson velveteen cupcakes, maple cupcakes, peanut butter cupcakes, vegan fluffy buttercream, chocolate buttercream, peanut buttercream frosting, creamy maple frosting, and vegan cream cheese frosting) has failed. I have used two different gas ovens, baked in all types of weather, and used all sorts of different brands of ingredients and failure ensues every time. The cupcakes are either completely underbaked and soggy/sunken or so fragile that they crumble at the lightest touch. The frostings on the other hand have always come out so incredibly dense and heavy that I have exploded two very nice pastry bags when attempting to pipe the frosting. All except the cream cheese frosting which was just a runny, flavorless mess. To be honest, I should have known better than to purchase this book. An old room mate owned a copy of Vegan with a Vengeance and I experienced the same sad results when I attempted any of the recipes in that book. Maybe I am being too harsh. Maybe I am a terrible baker who just lacks the NASA grade kitchen necessary to produce the results Moskowitz advertises. On the other hand, I have made dozens of recipes from [[ASIN:B007SRW9EI Party Vegan: Fabulous, Fun Food For Every Occasion]] and all have turned out perfectly!
B007MAETA8|4.0|Once again Mayer has put together a complete album.  Over the last decade, Mayer has failed to disappoint me, and while he might occasionally have songs that don't blow me away, he makes good albums, especially starting with Continuum.<br /><br />For people who might fear this is too \\"country,\\" I will say while it's not as pop as Room for Squares or Heavier Things, it's solidly the eclectic sound that makes John Mayer John Mayer.<br /><br />Favorite songs include Queen of California, Walt Grace's Submarine Test, and Born and Raised, but the cream of this album is Shadow Days.  If you do nothing else, listen to that song, and you'll remember why he really is an amazing musician and songwriter.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|a very good game,  somewhat repetive at times but enjoyed it greatly would recommend it and would play similar games
B003G4W49C|5.0|I was looking for something new to read... outside of the \\"usual\\" fiction stuff that many authors tend to copy ideas from others. Ender's Game was a very refreshing read. It was something different that anyone could relate to. A great page turner that I really enjoyed.
1401929281|5.0|I give this 5 stars because I tried out her ideas, and they worked for me.  Yes, there are grammatical mistakes, and apparently they forgot to do the final editing step.  I couldn't care less- the question for me is, do the ideas work?  And the answer is, they do.  Books written with perfect grammar, with ideas that don't work, do nothing for me.  I have an advanced degree, and there are many academic books that fall in this category, unfortunately.  I will buy anything Vianna writes.  She herself is odd, I doubt I would do training directly with her.  Aikido originally came as a vision to Morihei Uyeshiba.  He embodied it, and Tohei regularized it so it could be taught.  She does both.  Aikido is fascinating.  Do we criticize Aikido for Uyeshiba Sensei's shortcomings?  No, we enjoy Aikido.  I enjoy Theta Healing in the same way.  Now the most important part of any review- for me- is when people mention similar books.  So I'll do that.  I need to say that this book offers ideas on stuff that works WHEN YOU ARE IN A THETA EEG.  Otherwise, it is everything the doubters say it is.  Vianna mixes story in with technique, the way a Hawaiian Kahuna would.  Her techniques are useful.  If you want to go further, outside of her morphic field, try [[ASIN:0915811375 You the Healer: The World-Famous Silva Method on How to Heal Yourself and Others]], [[ASIN:0380756072 Secrets of Shamanism: Tapping the Spirit Power Within You]], Secrets of Ancient Hawaiian Huna Vol. 1 by Tad James, which is not at the moment on Amazon; [[ASIN:0130237620 Amazing Secrets of Psychic Healing]], [[ASIN:1470103605 Redneck Shaman]], [[ASIN:0906362709 Spiritual Dowsing: Tools for Exploring the Intangible Realms]], and maybe [[ASIN:1452851832 The Reality Creation Technique]].  This is a very good book.  By way, Vianna's rule that you never do healing on others, except entity flushes, without their physically given permission, is only a rule in her morphic field.  If you need to do something like that, without permission, and your intuition says it is ok- always ask- Benjamin Bibb and Raymon Grace's methods do not require physically given permission.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I did not purchase this case from amazon but I have purchased the case. I love it! It's so much smaller than an otterbox but it protects better.<br /><br />During the summer I love anything involving water. Before buying this case, I would not take my phone out to the pool. Yesterday this case proved that it was well worth the money that I paid, my phone fell of the pool ladder into the pool!  Amazing case well worth the $80 I paid at Best Buy.
B005Q6MJPC|5.0|The story itself is fascinating, and the movie does the book justice, which is rare, most movies leave so much out.  This book is the hero's journey [[ASIN:1577314042 The Hero's Journey: Joseph Campbell on His Life and Work (The Collected Works of Joseph Campbell)]].  Some would say this is for children.  Well, ok, I read it in high school, actually all of the Narnia books.  But it has deeper layers of meaning.  The 4 children are the 4 directions, and the four alchemical elements, and Jung's 4 archetypes, from which we get Meyers Briggs.  It's a good story, with good characters.  It's a masterpiece of its genre.
B004EPZ0BG|3.0|I was disappointed to find that some scenes had been cut from the original movie. This is not what I expected. At one time a movie DVD also contained \\"Bonus\\" scenes or extras. I guess now that is a thing of the past. All in all the movie is good but not complete. When the DVD is not complete it should be noted in the Product Description.
1401234542|5.0|I remember when these comics were printed on newsprint, about the quality of the Sunday funnies.  They have really come a long way.  This is a great story, very well illustrated, on high grade paper.  The positive things other reviewers say are all true.
B008EQIK90|5.0|Funny for the entire movie, and original scripting and scenes.  Kept our attention for the full hour and fifty minutes.  We wanted to watch it again.
B00004XPPC|5.0|There was a time when Hollywood made great movies, that told an interesting tale.  This is a tale of British prisoners of war building a bridge in Thailand.  The reality was a lot grimmer, but Hollywood polishes the hard edges as any storyteller would.  Great story.  Alec Guinness is outstanding as usual.  I was in Thailand, it is steamy hot like Southern Florida.

0486275590|5.0|Robert Louis Stevenson defined the pirate Morphic Field, for literature.  There is no other way to say it.  He would tell his subconscious mind to give him a chapter the next day, and wake up with a chapter.  This is a superbly crafted tale, an incredible embodiment of the Hero's journey Joseph Campbell [[ASIN:1577314042 The Hero's Journey: Joseph Campbell on His Life and Work (The Collected Works of Joseph Campbell)]] talks about.

B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I remember when WOody Allen movies were crude.  This one is polished, a great story.  Yes, some lines are very Woody Allen, and this is actually a very good film, with a good point, and a nice ending.  Well worth watching.
0425263908|2.0|I thought this book was definitely better written than \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\".  Unfortunately, the characters of Eva and Gideon are extremely underdeveloped, as is the plot line.  The story is so incredibly similar to \\"Fifty Shades\\", that I find it difficult to feel any respect for the author...at least there was no \\"holy Crapping\\" in her novel.  Although, I don't understand why it is necessary to be constantly using the F & C words.  That does nothing to make the story more sensual for me - just more crass.  \\"Fifty Shades\\" has an underlying romance to it that is extremely passionate because the author gives us more insight into the characters early on and they strive to make changes to reach a goal.  Eva and Gideon just seem shallow and empty to me.  And really, after a while, the constant descriptions of sex gets boring.  YOU NEED A STORY PEOPLE (she said in shouty capitals)!
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Blu ray is worth it.  Wow.  This is a classic family movie, a gem, a very good story.  The real story was a bit different, but of course this was Hollywoodized.  Well, any storytelling will polish off the raw edges.  Good flick.

0345803507|4.0|\\"'Christian, calm down. Ana's a remarkable young woman. She was incredibly brave.'<br />'Brave and headstrong and stubborn and stupid.'\\"<br />(Page 462 - conversation between Christian and his mother)<br />From the the last book of the Fifty Shades Trilogy, Fifty Shades Freed by E. L. James.<br /><br />The book starts off during Ana's and Christian's honeymoon, skipping the wedding, but there are couple of flashbacks. Ana is still uncomfortable with Christian's wealth, and he always reminds her that she has to get use to it. Since they didn't sign a prenuptial agreement, I bet. Anyways, Christian is still overly controlling, and Ana keeps on doing things to upset him. At the end of the night, they settle their conflict by having sex. Ana and Christian discovers the fire at Grey Headquarters was arson. So, Christian increased security, and becomes even more controlling. Ana and Christian will go through a roller-coaster of situations. Ana will have a visit from Christian's ex-sub Leila, one of her parents will end up in the hospital, and Ana, herself, will end up in a life or death dilemma.<br /><br />Throughout the story, the sex scenes makes me yawn, so I skip it. Sorry S&M fans, the most you will get is maybe handcuffs. Christian becomes Mr. Safety, since someone is trying to kill him (if you have not read the second book, you will know who, ....hopefully), but become more open to Ana about his past. Ana actually starts thinking after she has a major argument with Christian, when he came home drunk after seeing Mrs. Robinson.<br /><br />You can tell that James didnt re-read what she wrote, since throughout the series, there was so many things that doesn't make since. Although, I'm pleased with the story line and the ending of the trilogy. It was actually better than I thought.<br /><br />I recommend reading the bonus section about Christian's first Christmas, his interview, and him stocking Ana at her job. the interview in his point of view is amusing.

B007V508CC|1.0|A lot of critical things have been said about this album (see sampling below), but I think the most accurate and important one is this: \\"On much of the album, Maroon 5 barely sound like a band at all.\\"<br /><br />That's because Maroon 5 no longer really exists. They are no longer creating their own music. They recognized that all of the current hit music falls under categories like \\"disco-flavored dance-floor filler\\" or \\"dance-pop glitz,\\" and they knew to sell songs they'd need to hire outside help. Who'd they hire? Look up names like Max Martin, Ryan Tedder, Shellback, and Benny Blanco--these people are the new \\"Maroon 5,\\" and they are also Pink and Katy Perry and Kelly Clarkson and Usher and Britney Spears and Taio Cruz and Adele and OneRepublic and Gym Class Heroes and Sean Paul and Avril Lavigne and Justin Bieber and Ke$ha and Flo Rida and Pitbull. I'm not making this up--it is a fact that almost all of the music we hear on the radio is created by the same few guys whose names you probably haven't heard.<br /><br />I think it would be fair to say that the Billboard 100 has never been in such a sad, homogenous state, and I think it would also be fair to say that the release of this album confirms that modern hit music is vapid and soulless--it is little more than brand names selling catchy hooks created by anonymous dance-pop gurus.<br /><br />Adam Levine himself admits that Overexposed \\"is definitely our poppiest album yet,\\" and he admits that he has a \\"love/hate relationship with it.\\" Maybe he'll get back to doing what he loves if we stop buying dance-pop glitz.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Other things that have been said about this album:<br /><br />* \\"Every song sounds as if it was custom made to play behind the montage of someone's 'journey' in a TV talent show.\\" (The Independent)<br />* \\"It seems more like a collaboration between Swedish hitmakers and AutoTune than between Levine and members of his band.\\" (The Washington Post)<br />* \\"Even with various superstar producers on board, including Max Martin and Ryan Tedder, the album is stridently homogenous.\\" (Boston Globe)<br />* \\"Overexposed is a hit-seeking missile that doesn't just slaughter Maroon 5's reputation for sincerity, it festoons its corpse with glitter.\\" (The Washington Post)tar producers on board, including Max Martin and Ryan Tedder, the album is stridently homogenous.\\" (Boston Globe)<br />* \\"Overexposed is a hit-seeking missile that doesn't just slaughter Maroon 5's reputation for sincerity, it festoons its corpse with glitter.\\" (The Washington Post)

B00782O7IY|4.0|I felt disappointed by this movie but only because of my expectations. If there were no such thing as the Academy Awards, if I had just picked up this movie and watched it with no expectations, I would have liked it, thinking it a well-produced, well-acted movie, and, more importantly, a refreshing departure from word-heavy, action-heavy modern fluff.<br /><br />I can see, too, why it won Best Picture. Oscars' voters eat up qualities like \\"well-produced\\" and \\"well-acted\\" and \\"innovative while respecting tradition,\\" and The Artist probably especially appealed to voters because of its many winks to film history.<br /><br />This is a nice, pretty-looking, nostalgic, popcorn movie. I was expecting it to be more. I was expecting it to do what great films do, which is to say something about what it means to be human, to show an intensified version of reality. But it would seem silly to be disappointed in a movie just because of my lofty, arbitrary expectations.
0312945973|1.0|I don't normally give up on books, but I've gotten to the point where my shelves are so full and my list of to-read so long (and still growing) that I've accepted the fact some books aren't worth my time. If they can't grab me in the first 100 pages, even in the first 50, I'm going to put them aside. There must be something, either a cool character (even just ONE), a neat plot, even an interesting writing style, to keep me going.<br /><br />This book had none of those. I don't know if I'm just so used to fantasy books that non-fantasy ones are harder to get into, but this one was...well, hard to get into. The main character sounded pompous and vain and used anachronistic phrases and words that pulled me out of the story (it's told in first person). The other characters felt like flat cutouts whose flaws are flaws that aren't really flaws (naive, too passionate, etc.). None of them felt very deep.<br /><br />I flipped ahead to the end and in between and wasn't very surprised with how the story went. Unless you like reading Mary Sue characters, contrived plots, and anachronistic viewpoints, this book isn't worth your time.
B007VT6QSI|3.0|Bieber has been compared to the likes of Justin Timberlake and even Michael Jackson. A boy wonder, they say. Talent coming out of his [dark areas].<br /><br />Such praise may be right.<br /><br />You can tell that this was a carefully constructed album--it was not just slapped together in a rush to make a buck. It does have a tinge of Michael Jackson-level perfectionism. And it does have a Michael Jacksonesque appeal to universality, having both R&B and pop influences, trying to be everything to everyone, and -- remarkably -- largely succeeding.<br /><br />But do you know how you can really tell that this was a carefully constructed album? Because NINETY people are given credit in the liner notes. That's 1,000% higher than most albums, and I'm not even exaggerating. It's unlikely that Bieber even knew the names of most of the people. The list includes creative directors, producers, writers, engineers, programmers, mixing assistants, international marketing specialists, regular marketing specialists, A&R coordinators, a package production person, a stylist, and a woman named Vanessa Price who apparently does \\"grooming.\\"<br /><br />And that's why I'm not sure what to think of this album. When you hire a mid-sized company to create your album (and your image), I'm not sure it can fairly be called \\"your\\" album. And I'm not sure any of us can really say whether Bieber does or doesn't have talent coming out of his [dark areas] because at this point all we can really say with confidence is that a 90-person committee has been successful at selling the brand called \\"Bieber.\\"<br /><br />I hope as he gets older he'll do what Justin Timberlake did: shed the production company and start making his own music. I'm eager to see what he can do.
0385736002|2.0|Most of the time when I buy just the first book in a series I kick myself later for not just getting all or most of the rest of the books already published.  Usually the first book is really good, enough to continue reading at least.<br /><br />This was, surprisingly, not one of those times.<br /><br />I've been seeing this series on bookstore shelves for a long time and was always intrigued simply because I like the cover treatment.  For some reason I never picked it up until a couple weekends ago while on vacation.  I read it and have no strong desire to continue the series.  I'm not sure why; it's not a bad book (I'd like to give it 2.5 stars really).  It's written very well and there's plenty of action and it has a neat premise.<br /><br />I think the my lack of interest is because of the characters.  I had absolutely no strong connection to any of them.  Not the main characters, not the supporting ones, not the antagonist.  None.  I didn't care all that much what I was reading or who I was reading about.  This book had a very strong omniscient presence, flittering around from character to character.  Sometimes the description spoke of a specific character's thoughts in one paragraph and the next it was someone else's.  It didn't really focus on one character per chapter, it focused on all of them at once, which left me feeling disconnected.  There weren't a lot of secrets to motivation, I can already imagine where the rest of the books go in their plots.<br /><br />I can't help but compare this to Rick Riordan's writings because they both use an influx of mythology mixed with modern day situations and characters.  But I care so much more for Riordan's characters, and I think it's because he focuses on them closely.  The Percy Jackson books were all first person, from Percy's point of view, so the reader really gets to know him.  The Kane Chronicles are also written in first person, but every other chapter or so they switch between the two main characters (which can get confusing).  The Heroes of Olympus books have one chapter per main character.  Riordan's used all sorts of different ways to tell his stories, and his style is different from Scott's, but he didn't scatter internal monologues all over the place.  He didn't focus on Percy and his thoughts in one paragraph and then on Annabeth's feelings in the next.<br /><br />Sometimes I can forgive a cliche or weak plot if the characters are fun to read about, so much so I'll continue along in a series.  Such is not the case here.can get confusing).  The Heroes of Olympus books have one chapter per main character.

The sense of humor that Adrien held through out the books was very fun and entertaining.  I found myself thinking about whether or not Jake and Adrien would end up together or not...and Lanyon keeps you hanging on until the last second.

B001BFFTO0|5.0|(scroll to the bottom for width sizes)<br /><br />I saw these boots at my local retailer, loved them at first sight and tried them on.  I regularly wear a size 12 but they were  big. Great fit was at an 11.5 wide i think but they didn't have a wide, just a narrow. If it weren't for that I would have happily coughed up the $180 or $190. But i still was trying to convince myself to take them home. So i begged and cried to my wife from my mens department to please come look at my new boots. So after some continuing embarrasement she finally left her womens shoe department and gave me some much needed attention. Even my wife said they would look good with jeans and khakis and agreed they were pricey but justifiable solely on their good looks. And oh they are timberlands she said, that's nice. I didn't care if they were Payless shoe boots they looked awesome, rugged and sophisticated. Perfect for me! Although I have to add Timberlands are quite comfy and lasting because I'ved owned (2) pairs of PRO Tiatans for but busting activities like hiking and kicking hot pipes at the oil refinery. My first pair fell victim to sulfuric acid dripping on the top, but they saved my foot!<br /><br />With that said, I had to have them. She told me why not try another store or even amazon like you always do. Oh yeah, she's a genius! Went on amazon on my mobile and wow they are so cheap!  My wife saw that and zipped away to buy now 2 extra pair of shoes.<br /><br />But amazon had different colors and many sizes. No problem I had a Brannock device right next to me ( the metal foot ruler thing-a-magig with sliders and stuff to measure proper shoe sizes). So I played around with the device and used my fat foot ( most people will not have symmetrical perfectly feet, weird I know but true).  But my left had been broken in half and now was permanently pregnant, so I knew I needed wide, but how wide? So here are my research findings after fiddling around with the Bannock device with both feet.<br /><br />Fit size<br />Get at least 1/2 size smaller in length and standard or slightly wider size (C or D) and maybe even a whole 1 size smaller but if you do get a wide shoe.  the letter designations are different widths. But they differ slightly with different shoe sizes. D is standard width for a given shoe size. I think the increments are in 1/8\\" or 3/16\\" according to my ruler on my pocket knife.<br /><br />AAA = Super Slim<br />AA = Extra Slim (the more A's the more Extra)<br />A = Slim<br />B = Narrow<br />C = Less standard width almost narrow<br />D = Standard Width / Medium<br />E = Wide<br />EE = Extra Wide<br />EEE  = Fat<br />EEEE = Super Fat<br /><br />Anyway I usually get a 12 standard  (D) but I bought 11.5 E. My left foot was easily a EE but I didn't want him to look at a mirror next to the right and feel bad.<br /><br />These boots also saved my high water pant problem when commuting to the office on the motorcycle. The lace height easily covers my sexy ankles and saves countless women from distraction while driving.  The short height of the toes make them almost pass for casual brown shoes. I now pair these boots with my chinos and my engineer issued plaid shirts to wreck havock on the office women and keep them from being productive./><br />Fit size<br />Get at least 1/2 size smaller in length and standard or slightly wider size (C or D) and maybe even a whole 1 size smaller but if you do get a wide shoe.  the letter designations are different widths.

B005LAIIRQ|4.0|This film further proves the bad@$$ coolness that is Liam Neeson. But it's not just because he's a man who knows the wilderness and can kill wolves, it's because of Neeson's range from tough-as-nails to deeply poignant in a role that Neeson doesn't usually take: that of a suicidal man on the edge. And while the story is quite simple -- a Dylanesque (Thomas, not Bob) \\"Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night\\" -- writer/director Joe Carnahan ([[ASIN:B002VEJKQI Smokin' Aces [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B004856SQ8 The A-Team (+ Digital Copy)  [Blu-ray]]]) presents that story in a survival genre that the general public is not quite used to seeing. This film does promote hope and faith, but it also is gritty and violently real. Indeed, this survival story goes another route but nevertheless delivers a meaningful message. Despite the sad underusage of James Badge Dale, the rest of the cast, besides Neeson (particularly Dallas Roberts, Dermot Mulroney and Frank Grillo), shine. The film is not as good as I thought it would be but that's only because it ended differently than I thought. Plus, I REALLY wanted to see that fight!
B007P6VLRS|5.0|In a 2010 Rolling Stone article, Smashing Pumpkins' lead singer, guitarist, and songwriter Billy Corgan sat backstage before a show at Cleveland's House of Blues. Even he wasn't oblivious with just how removed the Pumpkins' fan base had become with everything they'd done over the past decade. When asked about their 2007 album, Zeitgeist, he said:<br /><br />\\"That album sold over 500,000 copies, it went gold. But people didn't listen to it. ... We would go out and play the first song and I could tell [the audience] had not even listened to the first song. I don't view it as a gross disappointment. It's disappointing to me that what I was trying to communicate didn't get the chance to be communicated.\\"<br /><br />Believing the \\"traditional album\\" was dead in a world of Rock Band and iPods, Corgan replaced drummer Jimmy Chamberlain with some new blood in Mike Byrne, who was a Lego-eating five-year-old when the Pumpkins released Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. Only Corgan remained from the band's 1990's lineup, and their first project became Teargarden by Kaleidyscope, a 44-track concept album to be released one track at a time as free online MP3s. Between 2009 and 2011, ten tracks were recorded and posted, but the industry didn't shift like he had expected. One day, he said, \\"F@#k it. I'll just make a kick-a$$ album.\\"<br /><br />(That might not be verbatim. His calm, benign demeanor makes even the sharpest curses sound like polite hugs from teddy bears.)<br /><br />Oceania is that album, the next 13 tracks in his grand Tarot card story. It is unabashed progressive rock, with tinges of that signature \\"shoegaze\\" alternative sound he's known for, but it is absolutely, one hundred percent lean, finely textured Corgan beef.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Quasar,\\" a stadium rock, Siamese Dream homage as energetic and galactic as the title suggests. This wondrous intro transitions into \\"Panopticon\\" almost seamlessly, yet without becoming two halves of the same track. In fact, the flow of this album is so slick that you can listen from beginning to end without disruption, and still want to hit \\"repeat.\\"<br /><br />Better still, the whole damn thing is laden with memorable tracks like \\"Pinwheels,\\" where looping rhythms build into a delicately acoustic verse. Then there's the nine-minute eponymous \\"Oceania,\\" a rock ballad that may very well be one of the Pumpkins' greatest pieces ever written. The music journeys like a horse through the desert, exploring every dark crevasse and moonlit gorge. At last, Oceania finishes breathlessly strong with the immersive \\"Wildflower.\\" Its melancholic vocals wrap you up like a pitched blanket in your bedroom, peeking out to gape as the star-strewn window.<br /><br />The tinges of 1984 and occultism are definitely intriguing, reasserting Corgan's famously uncompromising approach to songwriting. What you walk away with is music even the harshest critic can appreciate, the rebirth of an artist who stubbornly refuses to sell out, and an album that takes a little piece of everything the Pumpkins have ever done, and puts it all together in what might be their greatest achievement yet.<br /><br />Where 2007's Zeitgeist extrapolated Corgan's fitful reaction the world crumbling around him, Oceania is a proclamation that he chooses not to live in that dark energy anymore. He tempers his energy and rage only to pour through where it serves the composition of the album rather than use it as a vehicle. And though the story within the music is about heartbreak, the result is a triumph. But most importantly, finding this album is like a beautiful gift to the most disenfranchised Pumpkins fan who sort of lost track of Corgan over the last decade. \\"Welcome home,\\" is what this album says.
B007H9B8FS|5.0|My first CD purchase since the last Garbage release - yes Garbage you ARE that Special! This album lives up to Garbage tradition in offering an album with 90 percent no-skip tracks (sorry Battle In Me). There are some slower melodic tracks but all up I guess it is slightly more rock than usual. I'm not a big fan of the slow title track Not Your Kind Of People but enjoy Bright Tonight and Beloved Freak and for a change they're quite uplifting - no razor blade tunes in this release. If I had to pick four for a Best Of collection they'd be Felt, Control, Sugar and I Hate Love. The catchy What Girls Are Made Of is the 'attitude' track.<br /><br />Can't really see the point in offering deluxe and normal versions of the album - the deluxe tracks are not fillers by any means and the difference is a few dollars so why would anyone buy the non-deluxe version?

Really?  We can't even get all the nations of the world to agree on where to hold the Olympics without it devolving into an argument that goes nowhere and ends up being investigated by a committee that's filibustered until it dies in a sub-committee.

And NOBODY said, \\"Wait a minute... what are we doing again?\\" NOBODY said, \\"Wait a minute, this is COMPLETELY unconstitutional and TOTALLY violates human rights and is COMPLETELY unbalanced and favors the rich in every way shape and form, this can't be allowed!\\"<br /><br />Okay well I can move past that and get to the rest of the things in this movie that were stupid.<br /><br />So this main character, has a secret to success!

And NO ONE else on the planet has figured this out?  Sure, why not?  On top of that he's in a high stakes poker game and he's playing for like a 1,000 years or something as the wager and he is down to his last few seconds and the rich guy is like, \\"Looks like you're all in...\\"  And he reveals his cards.  Okay, first of all, anyone with half a friggin' BRAIN in their skull would see that and think, \\"Okay I just have to stall for a few seconds, he'll be dead and I get to take the pot.\\"  All he'd have to do is look at his cards, put on his \\"thinking face,\\" and say, \\"gimme a minute, hmmm... let me see... what should I do... hmmm... *THUD* What happened?  He's dead?  Oh, guess that means I win!\\"<br /><br />So Will decides that he is going to take down the system with the help of the rich guy's daughter who is played by Amanda Seyfried, and frankly I think she did a pretty decent job of playing her character in this movie.  And their secret to taking down the system is to crash a car into a bank and steal the time there.<br /><br />Really?<br /><br />This time currency system has been going on for probably over 100 years now and they just NOW figured out the concept of robbing a bank?  They just now figured out, \\"Hey, we want what they have, we have some guns, let's go in there, wave our guns around menacingly and threaten to shoot them if they don't give us what we want and then take what we want!\\"  It took the people of this planet over 100 years to figure that out!?!  The human race figured that crap out back in the Stone Age!  Some guy was squatting in a cave somewhere and said, \\"Ogg hungry, Gorg have food, Ogg want food, Ogg take Gorg's food!\\"  And now hundreds of thousands of years later these people just now rediscovered this concept?  Plus there's no guards there?  Again, these intelligent human beings that run these banks don't think, \\"Hey we've got some stuff here that is valuable and other people want it.  Maybe we should put some, oh I don't know... GUARDS with WEAPONS in here that can defend the place in case someone breaks in and tries to rob the place, we can fight them off and protect the valuable things we have!  No one thought to do this!?!<br /><br />The movie ends with these two characters walking into something that looks like it might be the Federal Reserve and they each have pistols with them.  I was thinking, \\"I'm pretty sure thisplace will have more security than that two-bit bank branch that you robbed in the ghetto.\\"  But I guess that would require the writer of this to THINK.<br /><br />***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***<br /><br />Even with all those things, this was still entertaining, I liked the acting, I liked the car chases and the drama was good.  Also I always like seeing or reading about a child rebelling against their tyrannical parent and fighting for the right cause.<br /><br />I recommend it as something to rent, not to buy.place will have more security than that two-bit bank branch that you robbed in the ghetto.\\"  But I guess that would require the writer of this to THINK.<br /><br />***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***<br /><br />Even with all those things, this was still entertaining, I liked the acting, I liked the car chases and the drama was good.

0345803485|5.0|I ordered the book after hearing so much about them. Im so glad that I did order these and the entire series i read them all within a week, i just could not put them down and they are mysterious and gripping. Im so glad that I have read them and want to give a huge thumbs up to E L James on here first series.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|If I would have known that this book was going to be such a witty sometimes messy love story. It wouldn't have sat on my kindle for over a month. From beginning to end I just couldn't put it down and had no idea what was going to happen in the end.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|OMG, This has got to be the book of the year!  Every woman should have this book it could be the end to all divorces.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love draw something! Its so fun to play with your friends and family. (: Its worth downloading. Its a cool game.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|Fix the bug and I'll give it 5 stars. Kindle Fire bug is really messing me up somebody needs to fix this or stop supporting that device.
B005FITIDC|5.0|I just finished watching this movie a couple hours ago and am still a little shaken by it. Gerard Butler's portrayal and this story are somewhat beyond description. His acting is top notch and the story is as well.<br /><br />It shows how the real-life Sam Childers goes from a psychotic motorcycle thug to a tried and true freedom fighter for the children in southern Sudan and northern Uganda. It shows his transformation through his new found faith in the Christian religion and the unending support that he receives from his loving wife, daughter, and mother. He goes from robbing crack houses to building up his own successful construction company.He's then inspired by a missionary to go to Africa to \\"help\\". After his return, he's inspired to do more. He then builds his own church in order to support an orphanage in Sudan.<br /><br />In the beginning, everything goes really well until ... you know, it doesn't. Then his faith in everything that he believes in is tested. Part of his \\"test\\" comes when his best friend kills himself after Sam hurts him during a heated argument. Sam goes into a very emotionally dark place where you think that he might become the monster that he was and is now trying to fight in Africa. He's then reenergized by the love and support that he receives from his African friends and the children at the orphanage he runs.<br /><br />While watching this movie you'll go through every extreme of emotion from joy to dread. Just watching how this guy, by all rights should be dead of Anytown, Pennsylvania, fights for these kids that no one in the world cares about. It makes you wonder that if he can do this with minimal support, what the hell is the UN doing in Africa?<br /><br />This movie was truly inspiring and thought provoking. This is NOT a hoaky, tear jerker, Hollywoodified construct. Watching it will be well worth your time.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|fun<br />kind of hard to get it working but now its good. lots of fun<br />good way to pass the time. reminds me of old school video games. try it.
B007R41E8O|4.0|This seems like a game for beginners.  Way to many indications of what the player should do next.  I is pleasant and interesting but I would rather figure out everything for myself.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It has plenty of different games.  enough in fact to keep my whole family playing together.  I would gladly recommend this game to anyone.
B0035V35PI|4.0|I like Bi Rain, so anything he's in I will like.  The movie was bloody, but where there are assassins there is killing.  I would have like to have seen some of the deleted scenes in the movie, it would have given a little more clarity to it I think.<br /><br />These were all deleted scene.  I am grateful they are on the blue-ray.<br /><br />#1  The scene in the laundry matt.  Knowing that he could tell the lady was an assassin because of her scent from the clan she belonged to me was important to know.  .  Big Mistake!<br /><br />#2  The scene where he throws their clothes into someone elses car trunk to trow off the other Ninjas, and how he stole the car to get to where they were going to me Mika's boss.  Needed to know that.<br /><br />#3  The fact that Mika got started investigating the Assasins by accidently miscoding documents requests and received the video tape by mistake, would have been good to know.<br /><br />#4  Also, showing her taking him (Rain) to the medicine store in china town before going to the motel to rest for a day or so would have been nice to know and more realistic with him being able to heal after all the cuts and injuries he had from fighting. One would think.<br /><br /> Anyway, Rain and Mika were great in it and made a good team.  I would recommend it on sale though to my friends.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is very entertaining and addictting. I got this game for a trip I was taking and used it the whole way.  I enjoyed every moment of this game.
B007SGM084|5.0|I just can't get enough of the books. I even reread all 3 three of them. E.L.James did a fantastic job. As for M Grey....oulala who wouldn't want to be in  Ana's shoes. Chris may have 50 shades but he can surely teach  you 50 ways of pleasure :) Hope the movie will be as good as the books. I also hope that she will write about his relationship with Elena....I'm sure it will be interesting too ;)
B007SYWFRM|5.0|lots of fun, super cute! my kids have a blast playing as well as I do too. I do wish that the families weren't so &quot; expensive&quot; or there we ways to earn more coins faster.
B0083GDLL8|5.0|This is a a wonderful piece of 180gram vinyl. My copy was dead quiet and flawless. This a wonderful remaster by the original engineer of Ziggy. The recording is detailed, all nuances captured, natural sounding yet with great warmth. Mick Ronson's guitar stands out, you can hear the tone of his amp as he winds is way like a muse on the guitar. All aspects of the relatively simple, yet delicate arranges ring like a bell. A fantastic LP!
B005HSG3VK|2.0|It is too flimsy and doesn't work to set it up to stand on its own. It keeps falling down and you could never try to type on it while it is standing. After one month it seems to be breaking down and I don't think it will last too long.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|Not sure what's with the bad reviews, to me, this was a great movie, both the PG-13 and the extra 17-minute longer R-rated versions. Along with the extra features that provide bits and pieces of extra (though not necessary) info about each imaginary place Baby Doll mentally escapes to. And considering the circumstances that's forced her to where she is and the disturbing things that goes on in the \\"asylum\\", she'll need it!<br />What surprised me was that, instead of both versions being on one blu-ray disc, they're on separate discs, but, hey? What can you do about it? Anyway, I found the story, the visual effects (especially the long camera shot of the Distant Planet) and the parallelism (both in the real world/distant places segments and the tricky visuals done that make you wonder what version of the realworld really is real). All-in-all, this was a great Snyder production.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|its a fun game.  my friend has it and at first I thought omgoodness what the dumbest game but them I got it and now I'm addicted.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the games are mostly fun aswell as challenging. Great if you have time to kill or kids to keep busy. The ads do get annoying though.
B007OWG3LM|3.0|Sigur Ros have come a long way in their development of texture and atmosphere. This is a very refined album; painted in subtle shades, beautifully modulated throughout. But(and there has to be a \\"but\\" to receive three stars) it seems to lack a firm underlying structure. It just doesn't have the bones of ( ) which uses a simple theme to develop a melancholy grandeur, or have the strange poetry of Agaetis Byrjum, which just speaks to the soul. Granted there are a couple of wonderful tracks, but the consistency isn't quite there. I fear this band may have blown their load, but they are still light-years ahead in inventiveness and sophistication.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|okay, i'd heard about these books that everyone was \\"talking\\" about, should've delved a tad deeper to find out exactly what was being said. but i had done my homework, dl-ed samples of the books to my kindle, and seriously thought that there was a promise of a decent story there...wasn't all that bad. oh well then i did the math and dl-ed all three books and started reading. and the dream became a nightmare.<br />these are just so bad on so many levels, not the porn or erotica (as you wish) the writing is beyond horrid, the characters are just right out of how to write a romance novel 101. cardboard. not even two dimensional, they don't get that deep, the one character that had a backbone (seeminly) is the best friend of rolling my eyes w/ the spine of a worm ana. she would've made a better hesitate to say this but... heroine.<br />as for mr grey well here you have young, tortured, complex, richer than midas, handsome (as in drop dead gorgeous, oh puhleeze) and still uses a blackberry. oh my the plot does sicken. so, read most of the first, some of the second, and as i had read the sample of the third went straight to the end. i'd put in a spoiler alert here but why bother. anyway, it's too late for me, so save yourself, put the book back on the shelf and go find something by somebody that really know how to write.
B000K7MMP4|4.0|I found this version of P and P very enjoyable and very faithful to the novel.  Elizabeth Garvie is my favorite Elizabeth Bennet.  She has just the right amount of wit and humor, very much how I pictured the Lizzy from the novel.  Her delivery is wonderful.  Darcy is portrayed much more stiff and unemotional in this version than in other versions.  While I really enjoyed Colin Firth in the role, this Darcy is, at least for me, a little more like the Darcy of the novel.  He is hard to read, and his arrogance, pride, and stiff manners make him very unlikable.  The proposal is done with a cool certainty that any woman he proposes to must say yes, because he is, after all, Mr. Darcy.  Colin Firth brought more emotion into the role, and we see him like Lizzy much sooner in the 1995 version.  The proposal is done with much more emotion in that one as well.  Really I enjoy both for different reasons.  A combination of the two would be perfect I think, but as it is, I do think this Darcy was more my picture of him from the novel.<br /><br />The rest of the cast was well done.  I really like the tenderness of Jane, and Mr. Collins is very funny, though older than a man of 25.  The few liberties they took were rather odd, especially the ones with Mr. Collins.  Lizzy does do voice overs, and while not ideal for a movie, they didn't bother me.  It is difficult to portray the inner thoughts of characters sometimes when taken from a book, so I thought this was ok.  The set and costumes, etc., do feel a bit like a stage production at times.  That is one of the big differences from this version and the 1995 version.  The 1995 versions was beautiful in every way.  This one wasn't as pretty.<br /><br />Overall, If you love P and P, give this version a try.  One of my favorite parts was how Lizzy met Darcy at Pemberley.  I won't give it away, but I thought it was very well done.
B0069UP2PI|1.0|There was no point in wasting 5 MINUTES on this crappy movie.  There was no thrill, no suspense, no point in any of it, and the most crappy ending I have ever seen on a movie!  I was thrilled to buy it thinking it was going to have so much drama, possibly even some flesh eating bacteria, and having a flesh eating bacteria would be an improvement on the movie!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|there's so much to chose from!<br />I live every game and I never got bored.<br />I cant wait to stop writing this and play some more!
030758836X|2.0|Meh. I'm disappointed that I invested a few hours in this book. Though well-written, the story is predictable and the characters barely believable. Insane plot holes make it all just seem too silly to justify its length. I liked Dark Places better, as absurd as its own ending was.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I have had absolutely no issuses with this app. It works completely perfect. I use this on my kindle fire and have had it not work at the maximum of 2 times.
0385335997|5.0|Here I am, rereading Gabaldon from the beginning and now just finished with Voyager. What a treat (except for the strain on my wrists). There truly are few equals of Gabaldon at characterization and scenic descriptions. The story of Claire and Jamie continues to satisfy, and she does make him a figure worthy of traveling backward through 200 years to rejoin. Jamie has all the attributes of a braw fellow -- brains, looks, honor, a warrior.  Lucky Claire.  In rereading, I found I had forgotten the passages in between their historic reunion, and that made the rereading almost a new experience.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|So far it is an interesting way to pass the time spent waiting for appointments. The graphics are very nice and the soundtrack is easy to listen to.
B0084RSYEK|4.0|Liked it but I expected more from Eddie.  It had its funny moments but I guess I was expecting to bust a gut like I did on his way back Saturday Night Live joints.  Things change.  I did like the fact that it was clean an my children could watch it without covering up their ears or eyes.
B0042YHC38|2.0|I am a female college athlete and needed to adjust the strap to pull tighter on my arm so it wouldn't feel like it was falling off, as soon as I did this, the plastic part that allows you to adjust the armband tightness snapped in two because of the pressure. Now I am unable to use this product after the first time of ever testing it out. However I did like that the product does not flop around on your arm while running, the plastic part of the case that covers the phone screen was sensitive to touch and my iPhone 4 responded appropriately.
B0050PYNO4|5.0|Absolutely one of the funniest movies in the past few years.  It will be a classic for years to come
B0086700CM|5.0|ive played this for hours and I have to say its one of the best apps you can get period.
B0076XIS4O|5.0|It's like the Cocteau Twins meet Enya with Chris & Cosey on synthesizers and drum machine.<br /><br />There's fantastic retro-future beats in every song that you can either chill out or dance to.<br /><br />The vocals sometimes veer into Chipmunk territory (Eight, Color of Moonlight) but surprisingly it adds to the overall effect instead of detract.<br /><br />Like another reviewer mentioned it's not immediately accessible and is certianly an acquired taste in the same vein as Kate Bush or bjork (whom I both love).  Either you're going to love it or hate it.<br /><br />So, if you love this I would highly suggest seeking out her other two CDs: Geidi Primes - a more folktronica approach to her sound but just as compelling as Visions and Halfaxa - a darker ambient sound laden with the same infectious dance beats as Visions.<br /><br />The verdict is still out on her Darkblooms split EP with d'Eon.  Although it does contain Vanessa, her breakout hit.  However, if you're trying out Grimes because of that song be forewarned it not fully representative of her sound.<br /><br />Every track is a gem except Christmas Song because the rap ruins it for me.  It's so out of place with the rest of the album but works ok as the album closer.<br /><br />In any case, I for one can't stop listening to it.<br /><br />Standout tracks: Genesis, Oblivion, Circumambient, Be A Body, Color of Moonlight (the beats makes me think of Prince)
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|the only thing bad about this game is that its takes energy. other than that I like it a lot and I love adventure games.

B000GPIPD8|5.0|After hearing (and loving!) only a few songs by the Black Keys, I decided to go out on a limb and purchase the entire catalog.  By far, the best musical purchase I have ever made.  If you like soulful, guitar-heavy blues/rock, this is worth every penny!

0765356147|5.0|Truly truly truly not what I was expecting. This book kept surprising me to the very last page. This is one of the most masterful and surprisingly satisfying ends to a series I have ever read. The way Sanderson weaves all the dissident elements of the story together to form an exiting, surprising, and well explained conclusion is extremely rewarding. The entire series is worth reading for the payoff of the last few chapters. I've never been so extremely pleased with a conclusion. Well done, well done.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I got the free version and then wanted the buying version cause it looked updated but it was exactly the same for the free version. I like it, but that wasn't fair.
B007XF0VW2|5.0|I must have watched this movie at least 10 times now and it is still good every time!! Definitely recommend watching this movie!!! Superb

B0086700CM|4.0|With the excellent graphics and the never-ending challenges, Temple Run is a great, new addiction! I can,t put it down!
B003MOHX8S|5.0|Just listened to the whole Album and I absolutely love it.  A year from now I will not regret buying this album.  This is the kind of music I was looking for, inspiring and without stupid lyrics that make me roll my eyes.  I will be using this in my workouts and as background music when I write.  So glad I found it.
0765350386|3.0|I won't lie, I found the story and characterization in this first book to be rather weak. Vin roles her eyes more times than I care to count and Elend and most of the crew are rather flat characters. However, it is necessary to slog through this book. The last few chapters are brilliant and set the stage for a truly epic second and third installment.<br /><br />Read this book because the next two are really take this series from mediocre to great.
1416972242|4.0|I won't write too much, since there's no way to avoid spoilers when reviewing sequels. I'll just say I was just as impressed with this one as I was the first one. Some things were predictable, others took me completely by surprise. I like that, a mix of following the logical flow of a story and tossing in a few jagged curves. Keeps it interesting without getting unrealistic. New elements are added, but it doesn't get overwhelming like sequels tend to. Not so many new things were thrown at you that made you say, \\"wait a minute... What about this thing that was so important in the first one?\\" Things are tied up, others left hanging, but not in a way that makes you want to rip out your eyeballs.<br /><br />Again, there was just enough angst to appease the teen readers without making me, someone older, want to vomit. Delicate balance, handled masterfully. Because honestly there's only so many times you can describe his \\"glittering soulful eyes\\" before I throw the book across the room. Clare doesn't bother with that, she leaves it up to the reader to remember all that stuff and let's Clary worry about the more important things, like her actual feelings and not just the appearances.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of Clare's writing, and the details she adds to her worlds keeps fascinating me. She's basically my new hero.

B007D2XSW0|1.0|Due to dubious permissions, and the fact that the Amazon Appstore version is quite behind the Google Play Store version, I'm uninstalling this and rating it very low. These are easily fixed so I would consider rating it higher in the future.

B007P6VLRS|4.0|I like this album.  This band died when Adore didn't get understood well by their audience and Billy pouted and for years this band languished.  But this album shows he's a great song writer with a great musical sensibility and all that.<br /><br />I've listened to it all the way through twice.  Can you imagine that in these sound bite, two song and out, click through era?<br /><br />Anyway,  my only complaint is something Corgan can't fix.  He likes his guitar too much.  This is a beautiful shoe gazer drone pound ethereal album that suffers when he mixes the guitars like a hair band group.  His guitar takes front and center too much.  He needs to look down at a fuzz pedal more.  He doesn't.  It's in his blood.<br /><br />The lyrics are appropriately trite and over wrought.  That's why I've liked them so much.<br /><br />One lyric says he wants to go home with everyone. (Of course he does...He's pushing fifty and that handful of young chicks he would indeed go home with each and everyone of them.  The song is funny.)<br /><br />Still, He has kept this band relevant and that's a trick today.<br /><br />Jim Harris<br />Author<br />Nowhere Near the Sea of Cortez<br />A Bottle of Rain

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I generally don't post reviews, but this book took me by surprise.  I found myself reading the first hundred pages by myself.  I read all 3 books and found it to actually be a love story with a lot of passion.  It was quite the fantasy read and I personally think every women should read it.  Being a 47 year old woman, his stamina amazed me.. :)
0345803485|1.0|The only thing I have enjoyed about this book is reading all the one star reviews. I keep coming back to Amazon to read just the reviews. I bought this as an audiobook. I am one of those bored housewives that sits around eating bon bons reading really crappy literature. Well the house wife part is true, but I don't have time to sit on my butt reading a book. Nor do any of the house wives I know. So audiobooks are my escape. I can plug in my headphones and get a lot of work done and enjoy a great read from time to time. I really couldn't get through this. It was so repetitive, boring,and juvenile. And just because I'm a house wife it doesn't make me dumb. If I had finished this piece of crap, or even worse liked it..well then the shoe would definitely fit. If you feel compelled to read it. Please just go borrow it. Don't waste you hard earned, budgeted money in this economy to make this writer any richer.

B003R0MEZ4|5.0|I bought each season on DVD so I can watch them when I'm ready - don't have to be stuck to a television schedule. It's my favorite crime show! The characters are great - Hotchner (Thomas Gibson) is so underrated! This show wouldn't be half as good without him. Sometimes shocking stories that are fictional, but taken from many real-life crimes.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I received my Deluxe version of Trespassing a few weeks ago but wanted to wait before writing my review. I've now listened to the album many times and must simply say WOW. Adam has outdone himself! I had really liked FYI although it was not the kind of music I would usually go for.<br />This time the songs are addictive! I can't stop listening to it and make everyone else on the highway listen too when driving my convertible playing Trespassing very loudly :-)<br />My absolutely favs are Shady (the music, the chores, so funky, sleazy and sexy I can't stop tapping the steering wheel, people must think I'm crazy), Trespassing (great beat and powerful), Kicking in (you can feel Pharrell's touch here) Underneath (very clear, soulful and beautiful voice, it touches the soul), Never close our eyes (upbeat and fun, very catchy melody). Also love Better than I know myself, Cuckoo, Outlaws of Love, Broken English, etc. What can I say? The album is sooo worth it.<br />I am a big fan of Adams but maybe not necessarily of glam pop/rock music, but this album is absolutely fantastic. I can see more of Adam this time around than with FYI, maybe because this record is much closer to him as he not only co-wrote most of it but he also co- produced it and took his time to finish it.<br />Adam showcases his voice and acrobatics all throughout the record, I don't really know how he'll top this one!
B006LSZECO|5.0|From the first page of this novel, I knew it would be very enjoyable.  I was absolutely correct!  I felt like I couldn't devour this book fast enough.  As a student in a master's level forensic psychology program, I found this book simply astounding.  The psychology of the main characters is stupendous and unbelievably fascinating!  The author has an amazing writing style, and what I love most is that she is very adept at describing human interactions and feelings, which I find many other authors have trouble with (Tana French is also great at this).  Human emotion is one of the hardest things to convey, and Gillian Flynn does it superbly!  I have recommended this book to several others, and I have heard nothing but rave reviews.

1603427244|5.0|I am a self taught knitter, and learned most of what I know from pattern descriptions and youtube videos. For the past year and a half that I've been knitting, my go-to guide for different cast ons, or bind offs, if not written in the pattern already, would be youtube. I decided to buy this to keep in my project bag for handy use, as it can get annoying having to get out the laptop when you have your knitting everywhere on your lap already. This little book is the perfect size, not too big, not too small, to just keep in my bag at all times. The pictures seem to be very helpful, and the directions well written. I think this book is a must have for all knitters.

0061692042|4.0|Readers who pick up Richard Ford's new novel, Canada, expecting a Frank Bascombe character are in for a surprise. Canada is far removed from the Frank Bascombe trilogy in tone, setting, characters, and subject matter.<br /><br />At its heart, Canada is about crossing borders--not the physical one that separates the two nations. The border theme is at work on many levels. The main character, Dell, crosses the border between a child's innocence and the sober realities of life. Dell's parents, Bev and Neeva Parsons, cross the border between normalcy and desperation, as evidenced by the shocking bank robbery that leads to their demise and destroys their family. Berner, Dell's twin sister, crosses a border of her own, leaving the house after her parents' arrest for the independence she craves.<br /><br />The book's dramatic opening line set the stage: \\"First I'll tell you about the robbery our parents committed. Then about the murders, which happened later.\\" Bev Parsons has just retired from the Air Force after twenty years, but he is ill-prepared for civilian life in Great Falls, Montana. After failing as a car salesman, he gets involved in a scheme with a group of Native Americans to sell stolen beef. When a deal goes awry, the Native Americans come after Bev for the money, which leads to the ill-fated decision to enlist his wife's aid to rob a bank in North Dakota. When his parents are arrested, Dell is taken by a friend of his mother's to a desolate outpost in Saskatchewan to escape a bleak fate as a ward of the state. Life on the harsh prairie is not much better. Dell works at a hotel for the mysterious Arthur Remlinger, who is on the run from his own past.<br /><br />Dell is forced to grow up quickly, as he sees and experiences things no 15-year-old should. He learns to adapt, to cope with what seems an impossible life. After the bank robbery that destroyed his family, Dell reflects, \\"It's best to see our life and the activities that ended it, as two sides of one thing that have to be held in mind simultaneously to properly understand--the side that was normal and the side that was disastrous--one so close to the other. Any different way of looking at our life threatens to disparage the crucial, rational, commonplace part we lived, the part in which everything makes sense to those on the inside--and without which one of this is worth hearing about.\\"<br /><br />His parents' disastrous choices leave Dell in a conundrum. \\"For reasons of our parents' disastrous choices, I believe I'm both distrustful of normal life and in equal parts desperate for it.\\"<br /><br />As she drives Dell across the border into Canada, Mildred Remlinger tells him, \\"Your life's going to be a lot of exciting ways before you're dead. So just pay attention to the present. Don't rule parts out, and be sure you've always got something you don't mind losing.\\"<br /><br />For most of the people he meets, Dell discovers crossing the border into Canada didn't change their lives, a fact Arthur Remlinger acknowledges. \\"You might as well go back. I would if I were you. Everybody should enjoy a second chance.\\"<br /><br />What he finally discovers is that life is about crossing borders. \\"My conceit is always \\"crossing a border;\\" from a way of living that doesn't work toward one that does. It can also be about crossing a line and never being able to come back.\\"<br />Ford chooses to tell the tale from the perspective of Dell as a 66-year-old retired teacher living in Canada. This perspective lends a maturity and a depth to the character. We see Dell develop as he must endure harrowing circumstances, as seen from a sober, mature lens.<br /><br />This is a novel the reader must read slowly and savor. Dell's remarkable journey is its strength. His survival gives him the gift of wisdom. As he looks back on his life, Dell states, \\"What I know is, you have a better chance in life--of surviving it--if you tolerate loss well; manage not to be a cynic through it all; to subordinate, as Ruskin implied, to keep proportion, to connect the unequal things into a whole that preserves the good, even if admittedly good is often not simple to find.\\"<br /><br />Canada showcases Ford at his best. I highly recommend it.ings into a whole that preserves the good, even if admittedly good is often not simple to find.\\"    Canada showcases Ford at his best. I highly recommend it.
B0041L0Z1S|5.0|I think this is a beautifully produced movie. I did not see the original airing, so I am not sure if it is whole or incomplete. Regardless, the characters were well played by the actors, who I think were all well chosen. In my opinion, this is the best version of Emma I have seen.
B002ZIAC26|5.0|Is Teen Dream breaking any molds or technically advanced? No, but that's besides the point. I understand criticisms leveled at this album and I would probably tend to agree with them in certain mind-states. But when I feel like my heart is being blown to smithereens, the lulling words of Beach House begin to take on a different meaning. Listening to this album makes me feel like a child again, strained through a sieve and purified. Nostalgic would be the best way to describe this album; it's all about capturing a bittersweet moment and drowning in it until it's too much to bear. Ecstasy and agony; two sides of the same coin that make up the extremes of this album. If you are listening to this album in a neutral mood, it will most likely sound unremarkable. Really, it works best as a palliative for when you're blue (it helps if you've memorized the melodies).<br /><br />I'm sorry if that sounded melodramatic, but if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to the album.

0385504209|2.0|REVIEWED: The Da Vinci Code<br />WRITTEN BY: Dan Brown<br />PUBLISHED: March, 2003<br /><br />An \\"Okay\\" book. It was good, but after hearing the hype over the years I expected a magnificent story when, as it turns, the writing was pretty standard. There are some great scenes that the movie portrayed but, overall, the story was actually downright formulaic and predictable. I knew who \\"the Teacher\\" and the pacing is a bit ridiculous. It's fun, entertaining, but not worthy of the critical praise it has received.

0345803485|1.0|[[ASIN:0345803485 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]After subjecting myself to this ridiculous work of sexual prose on Kindle - it took me a while to plow through to the end - my advice is to read one of the definitive works on love making and sexual behavior - The Kama Sutra (an ancient Hindu text).  I read this at age 17 after my brother brought a couple of copies back from his trips to India in the late fifties. Initially looking for titillation, I discovered it was a wonderful manual about the art of intimacy, kissing and sexual intercourse. I learned a lot from that about how beautiful the art of lovemaking could be, only later to find that many westerners had little interest or understanding in how to treat each other sexually with gentleness, kindness and respect. Yet I was fortunate to meet a few who did understand - my husband being one.<br />This book (and I'm almost ashamed to see she is a fellow English woman)seeks to promote the worst in sexual behaviors, titillating the desire in many women to make their sex lives more alive and thrilling.  I say forget all the psycho/spiritual babble of these past 2 centuries.  Read the Kama Sutra and learn the real art of being close to someone. The East does have some things to teach us here in the West.

B002LHZV5E|4.0|First of all, don't expect much realism in this. You probably can guess what the central theme is, a remote which can do things in the real world like a DVD remote can with movies. This has sometimes hilarious, sometimes tragic consequences. At times, I felt they clearly went over the top with some bits, which detracted from the film pretty badly. Fortunately, there were good parts there to save it. Kate Beckinsale and Henry Winkler were standouts in their performances. David Hasselhoff was good as well, though his character was, at times, someone you wanted to beat to a pulp. There is some similarity here to It's A Wonderful Life, though this production will not become the classic that one did. There is a lesson here: be careful what you wish for.

The paradox of Wild is at that Cheryl was whiny and weak as well as strong and disciplined.

B00006469V|5.0|Years ago Georg Solti was crowned or cursed by 'the experts'  for being \\"hard-driven\\", \\"bombastic\\" and generally, damned for placing manic over-drive ahead of musical inspiration and sensitivity.  I have always found these hackneyed and knee-jerk descriptions of his conducting, MOST of the time, to be inexplicable and indefensible upon the experience of actually sitting down and listening to his recordings with an open mind.<br /><br />I have played under Solti's direction, this was during the period of time he was in Chicago and recording extensively as well in Vienna, the year he recorded his great version of Schubert's 9th Symphony, which, taken alone, demolishes all the above-mentioned criticism of him being comparatively unsuitable for anything but the drum-banging warhorses of the 19th century.<br /><br />This recording of Parsifal was my first.  I wore out the lps ages ago and have had this cd version, only the 1990 original release, in my collection ever since.  I listen to it more than any other recording of the work, and I have 29 recordings, all told, of Parsifal.<br /><br />The spirituality of Solti's direction is beyond arguing, the ethereal soaring of the strings in the outer acts is breath-taking and often leisurely without being overly refulgent or turgid in the Levine mold.  Solti never over-spotlights he simply allows the music to flow and speak for itself.  His sense of rhythm and tempo are steady as rocks, which I suppose might account for some critics finding him \\"inflexible\\".  As a musician I find his dependability to be reassuring and freeing, allowing the performers to interpret more freely and imaginatively within the context of his unfailing leadership.  He is also a master of rubati but uses it judiciously.<br /><br />Act Two of Parsifal is my test of greatness.  There is the first scene with Klingsor's manic conjuring of the possessed Kundry which is right up Solti's alley and was always acceptable to his detractors as being so.  It is in the delicate and shimmering second scene that the jerking knees being to respond to Solti.  Mine never budged.  From the start I was swept away by the sensuous beauty of his performance and the brilliance of the engineering in capturing the individual voices of the flower maidens.  The music prior to Kundry's magical appearance sparkles and effervesces with sexual desire, another Solti hallmark and perfectly fitting in this music.  And the hauntingly erotic violin solos after Kundry's appearance are unforgettable in their poisonous beauty.<br /><br />Solti's Parsifal is the most satisfying of them all.  Thielemann's comes close but does not quite possess the unleashed manic, glittering ecstasy that flows through this great masterpiece.  And Solti has a magnificent cast, never bettered in my opinion.  Ren&eacute; Kollo still comes in for a lot of dissing but I'm not sure this great tenor has received the true appreciation he so much deserves.  He is a very fine Parsifal, heroic, steady-voiced and a fine vocal actor, contrary to those who cannot hear through the sound their own creaking opinions they formed decades ago inside their heads.<br /><br />The 2nd Knappertsbusch version for Bayreuth is justly famous and totally beautiful as well, but he is nobbled by an inferior Kundry and to me this is an almost fatal flaw.  His first recording from 1951 with Martha M&ouml;dl's Kundry is even greater for her contribution but it is in clear monophonic sound which might be a deterrent for many who wish to enjoy every filigreed moment of this opera.<br /><br />Overall, Soltis is the best, especially if you are not familiar with the opera and would like to love it as millions have.the delicate and shimmering second scene that the jerking knees being to respond to Solti.

B005EM8O8O|3.0|\\"The Fear Index\\" is an intriguing look at the possible future of international finance, not to mention society in general.  The premise of this novel is that an artificial computer-based intelligence is created for the purpose of making hedge fund trading decisions.  One wonders whether this has, in fact, already has happened, because if it did the owners would likely keep it a secret.  In any case, things get out of hand in a truly Kafkaesque manner as the artificial entity develops its own goals and purpose not necessarily compatible with its creators.<br /><br />Some of the speculation contained in this novel is truly brilliant, such as the event in which the artificial entity began shorting a certain airline stock.  This type of development is not only plausible, it is inevitable.<br /><br />The main weakness of this novel is its ending, which is vague and inconclusive (no spoilers here.) The reader is left puzzled as to what happened and even why certain key events happened.  I am an enthusiastic Robert Harris fan, but truly I believe that the author dropped the ball with respect to how he handled the ending. This novel had the potential of becoming a five-star novel, but the ending is unsatisfactorily.  RJB.

I would expect crisp and clear sound out of this mic but it's not. It louder than the build-in mic when I played videos on the computer that all. I tried on both Canon 7D and 60D and different setting on the mic.

B0068MNO4S|5.0|With Anonymous, Roland Emmerich takes his place among history's great directors. A riveting story told as an artfully unfolded patch-work puzzle of events as they happened or may well have happened during the reign of Elizabeth I. This film is a superb ensemble presentation; a really good script and acting bringing each character forward, giving the viewer a sympathetic understanding of his or her motives, even if some of those motives are repugnant.<br /><br />There's another issue lurking in the background, however, and that is the Shake-speare authorship question. If one questions the traditional attribution (the Stratford man) does that mean one wonders \\"... how could a commoner have such talent.\\"? No. The problems with the traditional view have not to do with class, but rather with life experience and education, and with the nurturing of genius.<br /><br />Mozart wouldn't have been the fully developed genius he was had he not had a father who nurtured and challenged that genius from an early age. In William Shaksper's case, his perfunctory education, his lack of any personal library, or foreign travel, or any correspondence and in fact apparent inability to write don't seem to make him a plausible candidate to be the author.<br /><br />But the thing can be difficult. From many of the comments one hears a certain apprehension, in most cases followed by the enjoyment of seeing really well done cinema. If you've not seen this film, I would advise you to lay aside authorship questions and just enjoy it. It's the best movie-making I've seen in a long time.

1610454812|5.0|I just finished reading the last 60+ pages of Fearless.  While the cover of the book gives away the ending, it does not reduce the emotions the reader feels as the story reaches its end.  The author expresses in the Afterword the same thoughts I had:  \\"...the final chapters of this book were heartrending to write.  I knew what was coming, but I hoped for a different outcome...somehow.\\"<br /><br />Fearless is not just the story of Adam Brown, but of parents who would not give up on their son: a girlfriend turned wife who would stubbornly stayed beside her husband to battle his demons; and friends who stood by their friend.<br /><br />As a reader who has not served in the military, this book brings out the sacrifices made by those who serve in our armed forces and their families who give up so much.  Just this week a high school classmate of mine welcomed home her husband from a year's deployment out of the country.  This book brings into greater clarity what it means for both solider and family as these missions separate husbands, wives and children.<br /><br />Fearless shows not only the heroic side of Adam Brown, but also the real struggles he faced through his life.  It is an inspiring read and challenges the reader to overcome whatever obstacles he/she may face.  Adam's faith is on prominent display throughout the book and reveals the important role his walk with Jesus played in his life.<br /><br />All I can really say is to read the book.  Fearless is a powerful story of family, faith and service to country.

Only problem is after awhile when I can't beat a game I get mad and throw my kindel everywhere. so make sure you are somewhere it wont break easily.
030758836X|5.0|Gone Girl is astounding. It is a gripping story of the courtship and marriage of a narcissist and a sociopath who appear to be experiencing the normal setbacks of life during our recent financial meltdown: job loss, relocation, mounting debt, family illness etc. etc. It is easy to identify with them individually which makes it harder to know who to root for when the wife disappears on the morning of their fifth wedding anniversary and the husband becomes the prime suspect. Another astounding read I would recommend is [[ASIN:0983555907 Holding House]] this will take you on one amazing journey!!!!
B005K0HDGE|1.0|I did not think the plot was very compelling. And the historical background, although interesting and I learned some things, was not very 'rich'.  I am not compelled to recommend or re-read the book at all.
0812981448|5.0|This book will inspire your creativity and give you wisdom about how to \\"Start Something That Matters\\" .. i would definitely say that this is a book with heart and a healthy dose of reality. I don't have the entrepreneur craving, and yet this encouraged me to think outside of the box and to be a trailblazer where few many have gone. A fun read too!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is awesome. and fun .the first time I played this game I thought it was interesting. and then the next day I loved it its fun
B00884GR0W|1.0|I only write a review when I really dislike a game. I love minecraft so I downloaded this game. Excellent graphics. However In the start u must get 30 blocks of wood. night falls quickly and monsters attack me. When I give the blocks to the npc he refuses them.I check my inventory and they're are palm. even though they were part of the wood of the tree. I check my recipe book and they're is no way to craft it. there r only palm trees though because I spawned on a island at the edge of the world. Poor mechanics. Don't get this. (PS: IM ON KINDLE FIRE)
B00127RAJY|5.0|THIS WORKOUT DVD IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!! DEFINITELY A MUST TO GET IN BIKINI READY SHAPE! JILLIAN KICKS YOUR BUTT... IT'S FAST AND A GREAT ALTERNATIVE TO THE GYM. I NEVER HAVE AN EXCUSE NOT TO GET A WORKOUT IN BECAUSE THIS IS LITERALLY 25 MINS OF MY WHOLE DAY! WORTH EVERY PENNY!
B0058VW36U|4.0|i  am completely obsessed with this game, because I play it on my moms iphone... and the iphone has a free version... why cant kindle have a free version too?? amazon needs to create a free version so more people can enjoy this amazing app!! it would be nice to be able to play it on my kindle because its a larger screen thancthe iphone!
B001750ZK2|5.0|Great cast, great acting, and a fascinating look at Harlem during the worst of our involvement in the Vietnam war.  Intelligently done, surprisingly little violence for the title, and a real pleasure to watch, even if they did apparently glorify the main character's ( a real person, still alive) good qualities, and down play his sociopathic ones.
B004TI5N38|3.0|You have to be completely brain dead if you don't see the shameless rip off of Lee Child's existentialist masterpiece character Jack Reacher.  Zero Day is more than simply channeling Lee Child, it is a lip sync of a combination of at least two of his novels.  Although I am a big fan of David Baldacci, this was beyond contempt.  The lack of even an attempt at originality is more discomforting as the name of his character, \\"Puller,\\" is a simple change of expression for \\"Reacher.\\"  Very disappointing in a writer as well considered and as original as Baldacci can be.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|The games are new and fun to play. I play them before bed to relax. Even my 3 1/2 year old plays the games.
B005HSL626|4.0|I loaded this app on my droid phone for the kids, they love it.sometimes the ads in the get way, though, but what-ev, it is free
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I know there are people like this but I personally would not put up with it. Have to admit I purchased trilogy to see if they ever get to a normal place.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love it<br />because overall it is a great strategy game but next time donylt use the city tickets with the coins
B00881VLCE|4.0|people complain about not being able to flip the pieces', but none of them need to be flipped! Love it!
B000002LK1|5.0|After hearing a few tracks on Pandora that I remembered my parents listening to, I decided to take the gamble and buy a copy. I'm so glad that I did! This is easily one of my favorite CDs. There's not a track on it that goes amiss, the style fluid rolling perfectly from track to track. For the going price, you can't ask for anything better.
B0086700CM|5.0|It is a great game I would tell all of my friends 2 play this game on any deivce that they have that can get this game.
0345803485|3.0|the writing is horrid and parts of the book are very disturbing, but if you can get past that, it's fun and quick read
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Incredible idea and invention. Extremely helpful. You will never again loose the information and can keep all your notes in one place. Get it asap!
0425180638|2.0|Considering the length of the book, very little actually happens.  Scarpetta again finds herself in the middle of another campaign to destroy her.  Not a bad book but where is this series going, what&#x27;s happening to the characters? Thankfully Lucy is not around much but when she is we discover that Superwoman has added another string to her bow.  She is an internet millionaire.  Whoopee. Despite Scarpetta constantly telling us how beautifull, smart, funny and wonderful Lucy is, Cornwell constantly fails to give any evidence that this is actually the case.  Scarpetta herself is not as sympathetic this time round either.  It&#x27;s difficult to care that her life is falling apart when she appears to have no awareness of her shortcomings and her lack of tolerance for anyone who fails to meet her Everest sized standards is galling when most of the plot is driven by her own bad judgement. It is a shame as Scarpetta at her best is a fantastic character.  Cornwell makes you understand why this woman does the job she does.  Hopefully the next book will be better.
B007SGM084|4.0|I reas this because I was bored. I kept reading it because it was enticing. I had a wide range of emotions throughout this book from lust and desire to pure disgust. It was a fun read and I recommend it.
B005LAII0I|5.0|I loved it, from the opening lines to the end.  It was unexpected fun for a Saturday morning rental.  The Queen's lines are just funny... some subtle, some not, just silly fun.  I love that Julia is not made to look perfect and the Prince.. well, puppy love is appropriate.<br /><br />It's understandable why it failed at the box office, people seem to have lost their sense of humor and perhaps simply did not get the lines being handed out.  Who knows, for me, perfection from the Queen, to the dwarfs straight through Snow White and of course.. Nathan Lane.. love that he got it, like Julia... a fun script is hard to pass up!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Its really fun and can get further by completion of a game. Great game to pass time. Told friend about it
B000002J03|5.0|This was purchased as a gift.  The recipient really loved it.  The item was purchased from their wish list, very handy for gift ideas.
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|I love games like this but this one is so so so repetitive. I think had I paid for this game I would have been pretty upset with myself. I played the whole way through cuz I'm stubborn but I really just couldn't wait to uninstall it.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I gave the original 5 stars and this is no different... it improves on the original by adding color.  if you enjoyed the original you owe it to yourself (and the developer) to get this game.  I know $5 is steep and I wish they would have lowered the price but it's worth it for the hours and hours of enjoyment this game provides.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is challenging, fun, and addictive. The farther you go, the faster you go. Its so much fun to play.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|This product was received in excellent contion and on time.  We love the Harry Potter series and wanted all the movies on blu-ray to watch on our HD tv.  Would use the seller again.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Great puzzles..hard to put down..loved it..ready for Azada2! This is rates right up there with The Lost City..loved the challenges..really makes you think!
0307346617|5.0|This ones intense. I loved it. It takes you threw the eyes of a chinese DR. and right from there it starts. THis book really made the gears turn in my head. I loved this book. It has helped me better prepare for the SHTF... doesnt have to be a zombie. I recommend this book to everyone.
B0083GPDBO|4.0|I'd heard from friends this would be a good flick and it is.  It's well worth a watch if you like superhero flicks for a little bit of a different take on the genre... with a little bit of  \\"Carrie\\" mized in, i guess...
0316548189|4.0|I have long admired Nelson Mandela - as a matter of fact, he is a part of the reason I started my charity - Building a Bookshelf.  I have wanted to study more about his life for a long time, and finally got around to it.  Although this book is by no means an easy read, it was consistently interesting and kept me turning the pages to find out what happened next.  I learned a lot about both Mandela and the struggle in South Africa.  This is history at its best.
B004HXIZVC|2.0|Sorry it doesn't even work on a Kindle Fire.  Why would Amazon offer it to us?  Why can't we get foursquare?  You offer other apps that don't have gps, such as &quot;where's my kindle&quot;.  I don't see the difference.
1400049628|5.0|AWESOME....Thats all i can say, it left me hanging. I know its fake but i really enjoyed the book. it tiped me off to WWZ.. worth the time.
B0078N2T8I|4.0|I had been wanting to see this flick for a while since I'd read some reviews.  I got drawn in very early and enjoyed the slow build of the plot.  The performances are great, too.
B004XGN8W4|4.0|This portable is a buy I regret not buying sooner! Its amazing and it does what its suppose to do quite well. The only issue I have for it is that the casing is too big, if it was a bit slimmer this thing would go great in tight spaces but it doesn't, other than that this Gaming briefcase is amazing and remedies traveling for your on-the-go entertainment!<br /><br />4.5/5
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|really nice application. works well and cheap..got it just for a dollar and worth spent money. I highly recommend. go for it.
B005LAIGN2|4.0|...it's pretty good.  I think it will pique peoples' interest in this arena of WW2.  The acting was pretty good.  Loved that they got that P-51 start up sound in there; nothing like a WW2 plane engine starting up!<br /><br />There was a little TOO much computer-generated images and not enough models or real planes and the difference is obvious but that's nit-picky.  Aerial stuff was great although I questioned a few paint job inaccuracies on the B-17s and some uniform parts were slightly incorrect, I believe. Again nit-picking. Over all, technically a good period piece.<br /><br />I would definitely watch it again and wish that producers would quit gypping consumers off by not putting any of the cool extras in DVD versions too!
B008CPZNL6|5.0|very nice, love it, it's like Pulse with a flip page interface<br />works very nice on the Kindle Fire.<br />and has lot's of magazines to choose from.<br />it also supports save news page too Pocket.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|It does what is says it will do completely.Works great on my Thunderbolt with Windows 7 pro.<br />Great app, for me,worth every penny.  UPDATED......<br /> Still using,But with Galaxy Note 2.
B004UID2LC|3.0|a good app but is it legal? also when I clicked on any youtube video online I was given the option to use the browser or download the bid with the app. don't think that's legal.
0307730697|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  A true story of one of America's great heroes.<br />Adam Brown was a fearless young boy and continued to be fearless in his adult years as a Navy Seal.<br />A great leader of his men who sadly lost his life in the grips of war.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think templen run is fun because you can buy more things with coins to help you in the temple.
B005T87QCI|5.0|this game is legit woo fun these people who say it isn't good are crazy I mean. robots fighting to the death. sounds pretty cool to me
B0060ZJ7BC|1.0|It was described as used, but it's actually a bootlegged copy. The disc is burned and the case is an obvious print from a home printer. I feel so dirty and cheated.
B0086700CM|5.0|this app is so cool, that even if i only get my kindle on the weekends, it is one of the first games i play! it is soooo addicting and i will rate it this way forever!! :D :D
B005LAIH2W|4.0|Disney's John Carter suffered from too much press.  It never had a chance to succeed because it was either panned or made out to be more than it was - a good fantasy film.  Some of the acting is a bit stiff but the FX is wonderful.  Give it a chance and you will have fun.
B005LAIGW8|1.0|I LOVE Nicholas Cage and he acted wonderfully in this movie, but it was absolutely TERRIBLE compared to the first movie. I bought the movie,<br />wish I had just waited for it to go on TV so that I could just change the channel and not have lost anything but some time out of my life.
B0073PPKNM|4.0|The beginning of The Absence reminds us that summer is here.  \\"Mira\\" and \\"Amalia\\" envelop us in sunshine, breezes, cool shade and pleasant views.  This might be the perfect soundtrack to summer.  But then \\"So Long\\" would have worked better as the album opener; here the singer departs for far away, no matter she breaks someone's heart.  She can't stay for her heart is already set in motion--away from home.  The Absence explores those distant places of \\"vacant skies\\", places remarkable for an \\"absence of pain\\" (\\"Lisboa\\").  The music evokes not just Brazil, but Tangiers, Casablanca, Madrid, and black and white movies where the protagonists smoke cigarettes and call each other \\"darling.\\"  There's a trace of decadent nightclub air too.  (Gardot is a bit of a cabaret entertainer.)  No, this album does not have the somber beauty of My One and Only Thrill.  We may be looking back years from now and wonder still at the excellence of that album. There are nonetheless special delights here.  And one is amazed at the new vein of songwriting.  Still, the poses she strikes from time to time may strike us as melodramatic, contrived.  As such we won't sense for the most part that depth of true feeling we found in her previous two albums.  This album is mostly a make-believe world, and because of it we may long for less artifice and more genuineness.  But that sincerity we fell in love with in My One and Only Thrill and Worrisome Heart still finds a voice, albeit diminished, but, thank goodness, not totally absent.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Its very fun and keeps you busy on long road trips. It os a great game for people of all ages
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Robert Downey, Jr. has deleivered again as he settles into the character of Sherlock Holmes.  This film is certainly more exciting but a bit too long.  Still, it delivers the goods.
B007ZZKWHY|3.0|Having finally and just watched \\"Iron Sky\\" I am compelled to record my reactions to this unique film.  First, it has achieved a significant cinematic achievement with a limited budget.  The special effects are impressive, if technically flawed (see below).  All of the individual actor performances are great.  It is a dark comedy drama, with campy and kitschy film history references.  I laughed along at various segments, as did my fellow viewing audience.  The story arc rivets one's attention and is engaging, at least to a certain point beginning near the last quarter of the film.<br />However, it is a flawed film both technically and based on the expectations of a significant segment of the online crowd support that had built momentum for this project over the past several years around the world.  A lot of these expectations were centered around how a fascist militaristic society on the Moon with a 1945 baseline of German weaponry - with a given significant edge of a revolutionary aerospace propulsion system - could evolve over the course of some seven decades along analog lines and how this capability would react with today's terrestrial digital military systems in combat.<br />First of all, it should be recognized that the film's central premise that Germany developed advanced aircraft of a disc/flying wing configuration during World War 2 is based upon a core of truth and is not some crazed nonsense.  Much of the details of these developments have been muddied over the decades by layers of misinformation and disinformation, but there is little doubt that revolutionary German aerospacecraft were under development by the end of the war and these developments were likely continued by the victorious powers after 1945.  For a highly readable fictionalized account of these achievements, based upon prodigious documented research, see W.A. Harbinson's landmark novel \\"Genesis\\" and his follow-up Projekt Saucer series and a non-fiction treatment of the subject.<br />Now, the basic technical and military flaws of the film:<br />1. German soldiers (Waffen SS) are once again portrayed as robotic bowling pins that can be knocked down in droves, while the reality is that during the war they outperformed the Western Allies with a combat effectiveness ratio of 2.5/1 or more and the Soviets at greater than 5/1.<br />2.  The flying discs in the film were single stage to orbit hypersonic vehicles, something no nation on Earth, except perhaps the United States with a limited capacity with the supposed secret Aurora project, have achieved.  These vehicles would have an inherent fantastic acceleration capability and could not be shot down by vehicles such as the sluggish USAF A-10 Warthog - they would simple zip away and attack from a stand-off distance.  This is simple physics and cannot be argued away.<br />3. The Moon Nazi's technologies are portrayed as highly evolved electromechanical analog systems developed along independent lines from Earth's increasing capacities in digital systems.  However, even with basic communications monitoring systems the Moon Nazis would have been aware of Earth's developments and developed at least rudimentary countermeasures.<br />4. The asteroid bombs shown being deployed by the \\"space Zeppelins\\" could devastate entire nations with an impact energy equivalent to millions of megatons of TNT directed to predetermined targets on Earth - this threat alone of hyper 9-11 consequences would result in widespread capitulation in today's socially networked and interdependent world.<br />5. Absolutely no nation on Earth today, or in four year's time in 2018, have the type of deep space and military vehicle space capability suddenly demonstrated near the end of the film.  The US today is in fact dependent upon 1950s level Russian space technology to send astronauts to the International Space Station.  NASA's budget has been devastated by the Obama administration and China is emerging as the world's leading space power.<br/>By ignoring these details, what could have been a true science fiction classic, will now be likely remembered along the lines of Dino De Laurentiis' amusing but syrupy version of \\"Flash Gordon\\".../>By ignoring these details, what could have been a true science fiction classic, will now be likely remembered along the lines of Dino De Laurentiis' amusing but syrupy version of \\"Flash Gordon\\"...
0767903862|5.0|I love this book! I must have bought it 5 times. I keep loaning it out, dont get it back, and then I have to buy it again!
B005LAIHR2|4.0|This is perhaps the best rock and roll fable since \\"Streets of Fire.\\" The music incorporates 80's rock songs into a fictitious 1980's Los Angeles setting. The mayor's wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is leading a crusade against rock, especially Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise) a heavy metal rocker god in the midst of a waning career needing a kick start. Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta star as the two wanna-be rock stars. Oh if they could just get their break....<br /><br />The music is both the plus and minus side to the film. It comes across as a movie which upholds the standards of rock, but succumbs to the evils such as lip syncing and mistaking glam rock for heavy metal. I enjoyed the cliche filled predictable story. The seasoned veterans of the film seemed to have enjoyed making this production as it lacks any seriousness. I spent most of the movie waiting for the talking to get over and the next song to begin. My biggest problem with this film was believing the character of heavy metal rock star Stacee Jaxx which rhymes too much with Terry Jacks (Seasons in the Sun). The could have done better.<br /><br />PARENTAL GUIDE: 1 f-bomb, no nudity other than butt cheeks. There are a number of suggestive/kinky scenes, such as a spanking, undressing, a near grope, stage dancing, and near or suggestive sex. A little too adult for the kids, a little too immature for adults. The heavy PG-13, near R rating may save it.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|I played this on my friends nook and it was free!!!! and there are only two planets!!! it isn't really worth what it is.....
B005LAIH3G|1.0|I've ordered and returned this POS twice.  I don't know what the deal is but the 3D flickers so bad it gives you a head ache if you try to watch it and the Blueray on the first disk would not load.<br /><br />Don't buy this crap and I think we should all seroiusly reconsider ordering from Amazon!
B007MAETA8|5.0|I sent this album to a friend living in Italy for the Summer. She is a huge John Mayer Fan! This is a great album and got to her very quickly! I would recommend this album to anyone who wants to kick back on a Summer evening and listen to some great tunes.
B004X75RK4|5.0|Betty White, the all-pro Snickers football star, is delightfully type cast as an over the top grandmother who plays the \\"death card\\" to get her way.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock is an uptight Canadian whose visa has ran out so she blackmails her male secretary into marrying her. Ryan Reyonds plays the secretary. The Department of Immigration apparently is so caught up with our immigration problems that is has nothing better to do than hound Canadians with expired visas. They end up visiting his folks in Alaska, where Bullock is out of place.<br /><br />As it turns out the secretary, whose income Bullock makes sport of, has a rich family which owns a town. Here she is accepted and made to feel as family, which of course makes her uncomfortable under the circumstances. What I liked was the guy who was the waiter, male exotic dancer, town store clerk, and the Justice of the Peace.  Mary Steenburgen is a fine actress, however you couldn't tell by this movie as her lines were few, and Betty White stole every scene they were in.<br /><br />5 star chick flick
B00881VLCE|4.0|it saves on table space and its a lot of fun! wish there were more puzzle pieces. harder puzzles would be cool too!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This was the best game ever I couldn't put it down all the elements were challenging Its Just this game
0439023513|5.0|IT is very simple. You must by this book after reading the first two (if you haven' already)because it was the most thrilling and addicting series I have ever read. I read The Hunger games in a quick four days after seeing the movie, bought Catching fire immediatly and finished it three days later, the next day I was done reading the Mockinjay. I enjoy reading but do not normally do it this often. This books was the best of the three and put a good end to the addicting trilogy. A must buy for all ages!
B005HSG3VK|1.0|I bought this cover along with my kindle fire. I liked it at first BUT after only using it a couple of months and NOT everyday it is worn out. By that I mean...when I use my kindle I usually have it set like an easel. The little thin place where it is supposed to catch is just way to small and it now just falls over. It just is not a good design, is not rigid enough or something...I dont know...<br /><br />I am ordering the leather version today so we will see of that works better. If you plan on using this as an easel...beware..maybe mine was a fluke but for the price I would it expect it to last MUCH longer than a couple of months.
B0085YNML2|5.0|I love the music and sounds and he is so totally cute!!! the game is good and challenging enough but not to challenging!! Perfect and worth every penny!
B00881VLCE|3.0|I really wish that it started out with more free puzzles. Even the puzzles they have for you to buy aren't really as interesting as I would like. All in all,  it passes the time well enough.
034580404X|3.0|After listening to all the hype about this series I found them disappointing. I am not a big fan of BDSM but aside from that the love story was OK. I didn't find it as \\"amazing\\" as everyone was saying, and I was definitely NOT in love with Christian Grey as everyone else seems to be. The authors literary ability is crap. I was so sick of the inner goddess and the Jeez, and the running hands through hair, and the mouths forming hard lines. Good grief! Overall it was a quick read that helped me pass the time. I will be bringing these to a used book store to hopefully exchange for something better.
B0013O123Q|1.0|horrible.  turned off after 30 minutes.  what the heck do folks see in this.  stupid effects.  whats the point of the dizzying moving?  i want my money back

B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is awesome its the best app in history. I love this app so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can't stop playing it.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|I'm nearly done with this book, despite buying it yesterday.  The story-line is a mix of believable and slightly 'yeah right'.  However, in some ways isn't that what you're looking for in a good story?  Reading is a form of escaping and fantasy at times.  So, I admit that despite being unable to believe some of it, I am thoroughly enjoying 50 Shades of Grey. It has been hard to put down to do anything other than finding a place to curl up and read. I am sure it may appeal to some, but not everyone.  Nothing wrong with that. :)
B00785P2QC|3.0|not as fun as other virtual games. long playing times to get anything accomplished. cant get into much detail. definitely wouldn't pay for it.<br />q
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Unbelievable this is a best seller.  This is some of the worst writing ever.  Especially annoying is the voice of Ana, supposedly a college student, who sounds more like a grandmother.  I guarantee you no self-respecting 20-something actually uses the phrase \\"twenty-somethings\\" to describe themselves or their peers.  They do not say to themselves that they'll \\"listen to thumping indie rock music\\" (OMG I cringed reading that), and they don't refer to a BFF as \\"my dearest, dearest friend\\" nor do they utter \\"for heaven's sake.\\" Finally, in the days of mtv celebrated teen pregnancies and pantyless partying starlets, contemporary young woman, no matter how personally inexperienced she may be, blushes, flushes and lip chews over every word or expression.  FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE (ha ha!) perhaps she should see a doctor about her condition.  Maybe it's early menopause.  I cannot see how this one could be of interest to anyone with even the slightest bit of awareness of modern western culture.  The voice and descriptions are truly cringe-worthy.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I love the fact that you get to combine things to make new ones. I love this game, it rocks!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Muy buenas películas y mejores extras. No me esperaba tanto, realmente son horas de interesante información y muy buenos extras. Maravillosos!!!

B0053YGYO4|4.0|So; what is driving the accusations that 'Mylo Xyloto' has fallen victim to the so called \\"Loudness Wars\\"? There is something to note about this CD that I'll get to momentarily.<br /><br />First; I can honestly say that although attention to the \\"Loudness Wars\\" is justifiable I think there's a need for caution as witch hunts and finger pointing can shift a bit to the side of hysteria, leading to false accusations and misguided criticism and an attempt to deem yet again, proof to the evils of digital music. Such attention targeting the 'Mylo Xyloto' CD are many and at times harsh. To add (and not to offend), while I get (in general) the point many reviews attempt to make, posting misinformation can unintentionally confuses and dilute the source of real knowledge attainable on the Internet. To borrow a phrase from Newton Minow; making it a \\"vast wasteland\\".<br /><br />In my audition of 'MX' (some details below), upfront; there is no signal distortion, only what was intended by the performers style for the album (note guitar, `old piano' track and the wet mix vocal tracks). The CD is very clean in that regard. To take my own advice (above), I sought out an expert to offer a few comments on the `MX' CD album. Bob Ludwig (of Gateway Mastering) not only is a principal and multi-awarded engineer involved on the mastering of 'Mylo Xyloto' but a legend among recording engineers and active speaker within the Audio Engineering Society.<br /><br />Here are his comments:<br /><br />\\"... I can only respond in general about mastering and not to the recording in question and you may quote me:<br /><br />Mastering is the final step in the record making chain.  While the final sound of the CD of course comes from the mastering stage, no listener can know what the difference is between the master mixes from the mix room and the mastered mixes from the mastering room without hearing and directly comparing them.  The listeners, unless they are personally involved in the actual project, are never able to do this comparison.  Thus one can never really know what was, or what was not done, in mastering.  Sometimes the client supplies us with a master that needs nothing further done to it.<br /><br />The purpose of mastering is to enhance the musicality inherent in the client's master mixes.  If the mastering engineer enhances the sound to the client's tastes, then we have accomplished our raison d'être.  It would be lovely if I DID get to solely determine how a recording was going to sound, like a dictator, but in the real world it simply does not work that way. Like every other mastering company, I am in the business of serving our clients wishes, tastes and musical vision.  If we give the client something they are satisfied with, we usually get to work with them again at some point in their career.<br /><br />Some famously loud recordings like Metallica's \\"Death Magnetic\\" were not crushed, at all, in mastering, it was mixed that way.  It was issued the way the artists, producers and management wished it to be.  If a listener does not like the way this or that sounds, please do not buy it.  Sometimes an artist wishes to purposely have distortion in their music, and that is their prerogative.<br /><br />All big-name acts have had their mastered music listened to very carefully and approved by everyone involved before being released.  Often in mastering the recording is done several times to order to get that approved, sequences are experimented with, gaps between the songs are changed, the mixes are changed, the mastering sound is changed etc. etc. It is never a case of \\"send it once to mastering and that's what you get.\\"  The mastering engineer suggests and advises how the album should sound, but it is always the clients desires that gets released.<br /><br />I personally prefer recordings in general with dynamic range, like the recent jack White \\"Blunderbuss\\" or the Glenn Frey \\"After Hours\\" albums.  These days, it almost takes nerve to issue a record with dynamics, but \\"Blunderbuss\\" went to #1 on the Billboard charts and sounded fabulous on the radio.  There are recordings I do that the client requests time and time again to make louder.  I can point to some albums with 4 or many more revisions from what I initially thought was the musical \\"sweet spot\\", each revision being louder than the previous one per the client's tastes.<br /><br />To repeat, especially when it comes to a big name artist, the recordings are exactly as the artist wishes them to be, and if you don't like it, then don't buy it.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bob Ludwig\\" (end of quote)<br /><br />I thank Mr. Ludwig for his comments and wish to also highlight, two before continuing: \\"... While the final sound of the CD of course comes from the mastering stage, no listener can know what the difference is between the master mixes from the mix room and the mastered mixes from the mastering room without hearing and directly comparing them.  The listeners, unless they are personally involved in the actual project, are never able to do this comparison.\\"; and also;  \\"... when it comes to a big name artist, the recordings are exactly as the artist wishes them to be, ...\\"<br /><br />As a professional unaffiliated with the 'MX' CD, I would support that most sound engineers (in general) ensure that care and expertise are part of the recording, mix, and mastering session and unwarranted criticism is likened to telling an airline pilot how to do their job. Knowing that the CD hasn't been squashed to hell as claims boast (maybe a little), I'll make a case in point; 'Charlie Brown' as tested. I measured musical peaks at -5.8dBu  and -56dBu for lows at 00:03:50:20.0, with a total range of 50dB during a song high-point, which is very good (dynamic range). These days a mix can be so tight and/or complex that only minute alterations can be performed, leaving little that can be done in the mastering process. A CD like that may have limited playback ability in a home system with tonal control being global.<br /><br />However; I'm attempting to identify the nature of the phenomenon at hand and look to the fundamental principles of gourmet cooking; you may have the finest ingredients but if there's not the right balance of 'presentation' and 'taste', well.

030758836X|5.0|There are always two words I use when describing Gillian Flynn's novels: dark and twisted. I am a dedicated reader of Flynn's and I mean these words as the highest compliment. All of her books have been the stuff of twisted nightmares, and her latest novel, 'Gone Girl', is no exception.<br /><br />'Gone Girl' is a story about a marriage, the disappearance of the wife, Amy, on their fifth wedding anniversary and the subsequent police search and investigation that follows. The book is told in three parts, which really allows the reader a deep look inside the workings of this couple and their marriage. Every chapter in the book is in alternating points of view, oscillating between the husband, Nick, and Amy. In the first part of the book, we see Nick's view of the disappearance in present time and we hear Amy's version of past events through diary entries. We really come to empathize with Amy and her struggles to make her marriage work, to make her husband happy, and to do what's needed of her. We also get to see Nick's side of the story and we learn some unfavorable things about him that turn the reader against him. The second and third parts of the story are told in present time, but continue to be in alternating points of view between Amy and Nick and we learn what has really happened in the disappearance of Amy.<br /><br />At first glance, 'Gone Girl' is a deep, brutally honest look inside a marriage. It may be a troubled marriage - one with problems that most couples face. But thrown in along the way are subtle details that make you wonder what is really going on. Amy has disappeared and we find out that Nick and she were having marital issues. Why does Nick have these little secrets that don't seem like much, but end up chewing away at our subconscious? The ultimate questions: What is really going on here? What really happened to Amy?<br /><br />Flynn doesn't let the reader wonder about things for long. In the second part of the book, she unveils the true happenings of the disappearance and of the circumstances leading up to it. All the little inconsistencies in some of the character's stories are laid out and begin to fall into place. Even though it is blatantly explained what happened to Amy in the beginning of the second part of the book, Flynn doesn't just stop there. She delves deeper into the inner workings of this couple and their marriage - into their very hearts and minds. What we end up seeing there is astonishing, bewildering, and sickening. Still, Flynn manages to write the story with such poise that it seems completely believable that this has occurred and could possibly - probably? - happen outside the frame of a novel as well.<br /><br />Flynn's writing style is some of the best I've ever experienced. The words seem to flow effortlessly together and the plot just seems like it was inevitable, like it was going to happen this way no matter what. The characters are so honest and flawed - so messed up - that they are utterly believable and heartfelt. The storyline is seamless and perfectly executed. She pulls you in from the very first sentence and doesn't loosen her grip until well after you've read the last page. Flynn's writing is addictive and I literally couldn't stop reading the book. I had to see what happened next, had to try to figure out what was really going on. To me, that's a sure sign of a great author - not being able to extricate yourself from the novel, even long after you've finished the last page. I certainly couldn't pull myself away, much to the neglect of my household duties and my husband's chagrin and when I had to stop reading for a bit, I went into a kind of stupor - wondering what could possibly be happening and trying to figure out how things were going to end.<br /><br />'Gone Girl' definitely keeps with Flynn's writing style of dark and twisted suspense thrillers, even though this wasn't as outside the box as her other two novels were. This might've been even scarier because it wasactually plausible. Flynn has written some of the best suspense thrillers on the market today and I am thoroughly pleased to say that Gone Girl does not disappoint.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received a copy of the book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.actually plausible.

B007STBUIW|5.0|Yes - this had a terrible impact on sharks -- but it made me want to save them as well. I think most shark divers will tell you the same thing. Now, when you see a film like \\"This is Your Ocean: Sharks\\" -- you realize how far we've come. But the question now is, can we protect what's left?
145168939X|4.0|I think, when I first read this book upon publication (2003), I would have shared much of the criticism here. DeLillo at his worst is cold, a little too lapidary in his use of language, but, even at his worst, his perception and satirical eye on our culture can be awesome. By chance, I am rereading it now (2012), after Madoff, after Occupy Wall Street, after the Arab Spring, in the age of i-pads and e-books. It reads very differently, funnier yet more chilling. I don't know if I would recommend it to new readers--- there is better DeLillo (my favorite being White Noise)--- but I would surely suggest that readers who read it in 2003 or so, try it again. I'd love to know others' thoughts at this point.

0545259088|4.0|I read the first two books in Maggie Stiefvater's Mercy Falls series earlier in the year and loved every moment of them, but got distracted before I had a chance to pick up the third and final book in the trilogy. However, once I got my hands on Forever, I couldn't put it down!<br /><br />As always, Stiefvater's writing is phenomenal. This world that she has created, her version of the ever popular warewolf/shapeshifter story is absolutely fantastic. It will keep you turning the pages, wanting to see how the story unfolds. And the ending will definitely leave you both thrilled and frustrated - as should be with any great series.<br /><br />For this third installment, we are switching back and forth between the four points of view - Sam, Grace, Isabelle and Cole. And the action in this third book, as the town of Mercy Falls begins a hunt for the wolves is much quicker and more involved than the previous two books. I also felt like I really got to know both Isabelle and Cole in this book, and could sympathize with them much more.<br /><br />I did feel the ending left me wanting more, wanting to know the future of the wolves and of the individual relationships. It felt slightly unresolved.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is the third and final book in the series - and I loved every minute I spent in Mercy Falls. I look forward to reading more from Maggie Stiefvater in the future and highly recommend this trilogy to fans of the paranormal romance genre!

I ordered it (as I order most of my DVDs) in Blu-ray.  Some people claim they don't see a difference, but if that is the case they most not have a good HD TV.<br /><br />I liked this movie.  It's not like the movie \\"Snatch\\" which I could watch over and over.  But it is worth seeing.

B007U1FEJE|5.0|I have read some of the comments on this album. When I heard that the Beach Boys were recording a new studio album, I thought it would be  a gratuitous piece of  xxxx (don't think I'm allowed say that). Don't get me wrong,  I am a total Brian Wilson Beach Boy nut. I even christened my son after Brian !  But some of these comments are overblown \\"rubbish\\". Keep the comments simple and leave the complications to the harmonies.<br />As far as I am concerned, this album just blew my mind. I was not expecting it. I have played it over and over, and just love it more each time I hear it, just like previous Beach Boys albums. I find the harmonies so unique and the lyrics so poignant, that it just hits my soul. I realise that Brian and The Beach Boys are not just a band, but an experience. I was born and bred in Dublin, Ireland, and .<br />I have noted that they are not coming to Ireland on what is likely to be their last tour, so I look forward to seeing them in Berlin.  If this is the end, may their legacy live on and on....Thank you guys for supplementing my life. I have enjoyed you since 1965.(late, I know)<br /><br />Liamo

B007KDFWRG|5.0|Well I've always liked Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi as individual artists so I figured that I would like them as a team but, they have exceeded all my expectations. Their album \\"Revelator\\" was very, very good. I decided to check out a live show and was completely blown away by the band they've put together. This is a band that must be heard and seen live. A fantastic CD and I'm hoping to see a live DVD in the future.
0307593312|3.0|I've read just about everything Murakami has written. Norwegian Wood and The Wind Up Bird Chronicle are among my top favorite books. I feel like in The Wind Up Bird Chronicle, something crystalized in a really wonderful way. All the ideas that he was exploring in the books leading up to it all came together in a harmonious way and the ending tied things up in a nice way, where it was somewhat open ended in a poetic way, but it was satisfyingly wrapped up. I really, really, REALLY wanted to love 1Q84. I loved the cover, the thickness of it. The beginning was classic Murakami, like visiting an old friend. It developed in a pretty satisfying way. I have to say the ending really let me down. I felt like all the wrong questions were answered. All the ones I cared about were left loose and hanging. I felt like he created this amazing world that in the end he didn't take full responsibility for. Don't get me wrong, there are some wonderful moments in this novel. It's not a bad read, but it just doesn't live up to his previous works. It sort of spins out of control in the last quarter of the novel- not that it gets too fast paced or anything it just stops going anywhere and then eventually he has to end it and he does and I was left with the feeling of, wow, you took us all of those places and now this is where you're leaving us? Anyway, read it if you must, but if you haven't read any of his books try any other one first.

0345803485|1.0|I tried.<br />I seriously tried.<br />I've tried twice.<br />It is physically impossible for me to get past Chapter Ten of this monstrosity.<br /><br />When I read that this was a re-write of a Twilight fanfiction (not that the Twilight Series was a shining beacon of good literature itself), I kind of gave it a little bit of hope since I write fanfiction (not for Twilight) myself. Thought they'd clean it up, make it sparkle and stand alone as its own story.<br /><br />I couldn't be any more wrong.<br /><br />It was a literal re-write of this fanfiction. Spelling fails, grammar errors, syntax mistakes, they were all left in the final print of the book as if it had never even touched an editor's desk. It was the same drivel from the fanfiction version, just that the character's names were changed. That's just BAD.<br /><br />There was nothing redeeming about this \\"story\\". Everything was so glaringly Twilight, even with the \\"new\\" characters, I felt like I reading Twilight, just with \\"detailed\\" sex.<br /><br />To be honest, Shade's Anastasia was far more infuriating than Twilight's Bella. I could almost forgive Bella for her stupidity because she was a teenager and what teenager hasn't done something silly like that before?<br /><br />Anastasia is completely irredeemable. Her character is annoying, infuriating and sickening. She's a grown woman who acts like a twelve-year-old. It was painful.<br /><br />Smut in an erotic book is supposed to make the reader all hot and bothered, right? When I read sex, I want it to be gripping, smoldering material between the two characters. The sex in Shades is laughable at best and cringe worthy at worst.<br /><br />I DEFINITELY will not be purchasing the other two books in this series. I've already been jipped once; I'll be damned if I get ripped off two more times.<br /><br />I'll give the Twilight Series credit: at least I could finish THAT.

B008B1W3V4|2.0|Really?<br />This is M5?<br />This album does not even come close to quality that M5 has favored us from their last albums. It is as if someone cloned them, locked the originals away, and had these falsifications try to do something between Rap and 80's Disco.<br />Please!<br />The album is ruined completely by the first two songs outright.  Payphone had potential and it was going good until they inserted the rappist in the middle and completely wrecked whatever promise it ever had.  Why the RAP?  Why the foul language is needed I don't know.  It's like they need to cuss to express themselves and it dampens the strength of their music. Even the Album Artwork sucks, an indicator of what to expect inside.<br />Two things they need to do for their next album.<br />1. NO RAP/THUMP-A-CUSS. Guys you can sing and well but the rap has got to be omitted.<br />2. Change your theme.  I applaud the songs and musical prowess, but the bad relation, girlfriend cheating me/me cheating her, sorrowful drone is getting old.  When you cover other peoples songs you shine.  Take that with some fresh lyrics of your own and you will soar.<br />Don't get me wrong, folks,  There are some good songs on the album, but not enough to merit the name Maroon 5 has earned from past endeavours.<br />Not recommended for all of the hype I read and saw, please guys go back and re-think yourselves before venturing out into the music world again...<br />Sad
0060987464|5.0|Now THIS is rock & roll. Whether you're a Manson fan or not, this is a respectable journey of a brave free-thinker who is dedicated to his art like nothing you've seen before. The pages are PACKED with humor, terror & mystery, all wrapped in one shocking human experience. You get chills when he describes his fears, and you can feel his tears as he takes us through his tragedies.<br /><br />If you take nothing else from the book, you should realize this man is a dark knight, taking hatred for attempting to rattle the cages of blind conformity. The grit & grime unsurprisingly cause this to be an R-Rated book, but it's honest & open and worth the experience. This story truly is a road through hell & back.

1593083793|4.0|This is a classic for anyone interested in Eastern religions/ways of life, but don't expect a real epic adventure. The book is as slow moving as its characters. I was more excited to start reading it than I was actually reading it. However, it holds multiple life-long messages, all extracted from an author who has respectfully learned them first-hand. It's short & precise, and reminds us how cool monks are, even if it's not original (it's nearly identical to the acclaimed story of the Buddha). Read it, learn from it, move on!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use it for all my lists. I am a bargain shopper so I use Evernotes to keep track of four different shopping lists. I use Evernotes to recall future programs and dates. I list important reminders of events and jobs needing to be completed.
0307346617|4.0|A great book with a good balance of grotesque and intellect. It's realistic & unbelievably well-thought-out. Brooks not only indulges our present intrigue of zombies, but brings to life the possibilities & disasters that would come from an actual virus outbreak. These pages involve multiple spooky stories that almost kept me up at night. The one drawback is that there is little to no climax or suspense, but here are surely a few twists & turns.<br /><br />This book also shows that Brooks has a great grasp on many global cultures, predicting in intensely realistic detail every country's reaction to an outbreak. This book is as much about the world's economic breakdown as it is blood & guts. It reminds us the importance of surpassing petty differences & coming together as one. Whether you're a zombie freak or not, this book gives you something to think about.

030758836X|5.0|I love this author, and appreciate her even more after having skimmed through a series of books that attempt, but fail, to follow the same plot development techniques. Gillian Flynn hooked me from the start with her first novel, Sharp Objects. Her style is captivating and she is *so* darkly funny.  Gone Girl is a cut above the basic mystery novel. Gillian Flynn's voice is strong and her writing doesn't make compromises. She isn't afraid to present the dark side of human nature, and achieves this without getting bogged down with formulaic style choices, and she isn't afraid to take risks with plot development. I love how Gone Girl kind of goes along in the first half, has me wondering, OK where is this leading, and then--POW--the second part takes off, catching me completely by surprise.  Amy had me laughing (a little guiltily) at her unflinching critique of her companions. The ladies and their casseroles made from some sort of chips and canned soup, the &#34;cool girl&#34;, the Ozark Amy riffs. She's nuts, but I can relate to the sense of shock and anger when being transplanted to a new and culturally different locale. Nick's dysfunctional husband character is somewhat stilted, but I think that's the point of Nick's character in relation to Amy.  The end, to me, was fine and I can't imagine any other outcome. The only thing I didn't like about the ending was just that--it ended the book. I hope G.F. writes another novel soon.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|This is a great game. Its fun to play and you have to think. Some of the things don't make sence though.. I really enjoy it and recommend it to everyone ( with the kidsafe).
B007SOQBCM|4.0|it works great for me and has no lag. but it needs more features like sign in. It also needs better quality options.
B007V5CF5K|4.0|This is a fun puzzler, but too small for a phone screen. many of the pieces you're looking for are very wee. they're are supposed to blend in with the background some, it's a little ridiculous on a three inch screen. The lettering is eye-straining at this size. Otherwise the game rocks.
B005XI7S3G|5.0|This album is so amazing and i cant stop listening to it! its probably the best album i have ever purchased! if you love this album, i would also recommend Selena Gomez's year without rain album.

B000YJ54DU|3.0|Quite different from the previous Reacher novels I've read.  It was a bit slow to get into but the story finally came full circle.<br /><br />Definitely not the best but it was ok.
B007Z9QS5K|1.0|one of the worst movies i have ever paid to watch. about half as good as a free movie on an obscure cable channel. it's amazing that they managed to get so much talent into such garbage. jokes are corny, the dramatic situations are tedious, and the character development is less effective than a tv commercial.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've tried several different keyboards (including iPhones and Windows Phones). They each have their pros and cons, but this is the best of the choices. I'm a quick typist and it helps me look like a champ! I'm a good speller, except when it comes to my phone. It helps me decrease my errors significantly. This is definitely the most used app I use. Keep up the good work... And updates! :-)<br /><br />Thank you!

B004XUMPFQ|5.0|Firefly is a great sci-fi series.  Firefly is a great western series.  Thinking about it, Firefly is a great \\"Scifistern\\".  It has an awesome story line, wonderful actors, plenty of action, a lot of humor, and great attention-grabbing writing.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|I loved this book! The ending is slightly confusing, and sad, so I would not recommend it to [very] young readers or beginners. It would be good for fluent readers ages 9-12, but it is also nice for adults. I could not put it down and this is the kind of book you will want to read over and over!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I decided to read \\"Gone Girl\\" because of all the hype surrounding it. For the first half of the book, I thought it was okay...well-written, interesting characters, but a bit drawn out and also predictable, as I was SO SURE I knew what had actually happened. Then I started Part II of the book....and OMG, I so did not see any of that coming!!!!! The author really pulls one over on her readers here, and in a very good way. (I can't wait for this book to eventually be made into a movie, as it has the potential to be super awesome.) I was very anxious to see how everything in the book would resolve itself (forgive me for being so vague; I don't want to ruin it by giving anything away!). The end of the book is quite a surprise, and for me at least, it left me a tad disappointed, as I'd imagined and hoped for a different resolution. But all of these surprises are what make \\"Gone Girl\\" such a unique and engaging book. This is a must-read this summer!
B004XANKVO|5.0|In the past few weeks that I've had this backpack I've used it for so many things.

I live this lifestyle myself as I am a submissive female.  I've been in this lifestyle for 25 years! Awesome awesome book!

B0064NTZJO|2.0|Based on the trailer and some comments about this film I was looking forward to it. Looked fairly action packed. Well, it was, in the trailer as that's all you get. The lead actor is appealing, if you like the moody, silent type. I would bet his lines were less than 100 words and when he did speak it was after long pauses. The movie starts off agonizingly slow after the initial chase scene, which was, in itself lacking emotion. Long scenes of the lead actor and plain Jane lead actress just looking at one another, not saying much. What they saw in each other is unexplainable. There was one scene of the lead actors face where I thought the bluray was actually frozen. It lasted about 15 seconds, close up of his face, and then he blinked. What was this director thinking? Are we supposed to fill in the void? How?  Were we somehow supposed to build a character based on these boring shots, or was this just \\"artistic\\" and I missed it. Albert Brooks does a good job as the baddy and there are some well done, yet very graphic scenes of violence. This is NOT an action movie, but belongs in some art house where you can sit over a latte and tell me just what the hell was the point. The ending left me saying, \\"huh?\\". Not a spoiler, but it had as much emotional impact as the directing. Very, very disappointed in this movie.

B004DK5CW4|5.0|My daughter-in-law kept telling me that I need to watch the movie Secretariat. I paid attention because we share the same interest in movies. However, it took me a full year before I watched this movie. I never heard of Secretariat for one thing. Finally, she loaned me the movie. A year later (2012) I can say that I have watched the movie no less than 100 times. My heart still pounds when I watch the Triple Crown races. The music (and silence) is perfect for the moment. She finally just gave me the DVD. I have since bought several books about Secretariat to get the 'real' story. The real story is even better.
0345803493|3.0|Please bear with me folks. As I said in my previous review for Fifty Shades of Grey, I'm a little addicted to the series. While this is not the best I've ever read, I find myself staying up until 3 am to finish these strange and dirty books.<br /><br />Fifty Shades Freed lets off right where Fifty Shades of Grey ends. I won't give too much away as that would ruin the end of book one for a lot of people, but Christian and Ana find themselves questioning their relationship and their beliefs. As if that weren't enough to cause some stress to this kinky couple, Grey's exes begin to come into the picture and Ana may be in danger of losing her life.<br /><br />I did like this second installment better than Shades of Grey. I don't know if that's because we see a lot less of the Dominant Grey and more of the lovable Christian that Ana falls for. There was more of a plot in this story as Grey and Ana are not simply having sexual relations and fighting. In Fifty Shades Darker, Ana and Christian must overcome some big obstacles in their lives to be happy.<br /><br />This book was more of a romance than the last one. It didn't shock me as much as the first book and so it's hard to compare the two books. I did like Ana a little bit better in this book. She stood up for herself and actually stood up to Grey which I found much better for reading. Christian also opens up a lot more. He comes to terms with his issues and lets Ana in, little by little.<br /><br />Now, don't think that we got away from the Twilight themes in this one people, this book, just like the last was full of Twilight familiarity. There were even a few lines that were taken directly from Stephanie Meyer's books. Again, take it with a grain of salt, these books aren't a great piece of fiction. Also, we still had a lot of repetition in this book which made for some confusing moments through out the book.<br /><br />If you've read the first book, it's worth it to keep going in the series. This book gives you a little bit more closure than Fifty Shades of Grey and I think you'll like it even better than the first. I'm on to book three now!<br /><br />6 out of 10<br /><br />Happy Reading :)<br /><br />Allison<br />[...]f Grey and I think you'll like it even better than the first.

0385360169|1.0|I have poor eyesite so I listen to recorded books on my Ipod, many of which I download from my public library. I was #121 on the list when I first tried to get this downloaded. The libraries that participate in the electronic download program began with 4 copies and then went up to 18 copies. What a waste of tax payer money. It still took several months for me to top the list.<br /><br />What a disappointment! This is suppose to be erotica with a narrator that sounds about 12 or 14 at the most. Don't producers of recorded books get it? We listeners are trying to get a picture in our heads of what's going on. What I am seeing is a 12 yr old, dressed up as a college grad with clothes too big and out of her age range approaching this lecher of a business titan.<br /><br />That's as far as I've gotten and may not listen to anymore. I just can't stand her voice. Looking at the other reviews, I'm glad I have my library and didn't have to pay for this rip off.

0307956350|2.0|I have no idea why so many people gave this book 4 and 5 stars. I gave it only 2 stars because it wasn't the worst book I've read in 2012, but the year isn't over yet.<br /><br />The beginning seemed very interesting and then things started to get...well...jumbled. One chapter is in the present, the next chapter is in the past, the following chapter is in the distant past, the next chapter is in the who-knows-when, and on and on.<br /><br />I guess what really bothered me about THE EXPATS was the author's attempt to write the way a woman (Kate) would actually think and act. He failed to convince me that he was anything but a man trying to write like he believes a woman would write about another woman, if you follow me. Unconvincing sums it up.<br /><br />Fortunately, I got this from the library and only wasted my time and not my money. I do not recommend THE EXPATS.
B0045HCJKS|4.0|Westworld(released Nov/73)has a good cast of actors of which to draw on and the lead belongs to Yul Brynner,as the steely robotic gunslinger who pursues his prey relentlessly during the last 1/2 hour of the picture.Before that he is seen only sporadically.As far as screen time goes his is relatively small compared to his fellow actors James Brolin(playing John Blane-boy does his son Josh look like his Dad),Richard Benjamin(Peter Martin)and Dick Van Patten who plays a meek banker.Benjamin had had a prematurely(I think)cancelled winner of a TV show with He & She,Brolin was already starring in Marcus Welby,M.D.and Dick Van Patton would in a short time be tagged for the starring role in the hit TV show Eight is Enough.<br />Westworld is,as the plot goes,one of three worlds set in a theme park area,the others being Medieval World and Roman World.Your price is $1,000 a day to experience life in these various true to life environments,with absolutely no risk to yourself at all.Everything is computer controlled,and to populate this world are robots,each one imbued with their own role to play and,if need be,such as sex robots,be at the disposal of its human companion.Nothing has been left to chance and every little detail down to the lowliest snake,mimics real life.The variables,and as a result the experiences,are limitless.<br />Into this world comes John Blane,an experienced Westworld customer,a new comer to Westworld by the name of Peter Martin,and a meek banker,name unknown.Blane coaches Martin as they first enter the park but soon Martin is getting along as good as Blane ever did.The banker takes on the exact opposite of his meek persona by becoming a sheriff.All is going well even as Martin and Blane run into a gunslinger and dispatch him with no problem,after he had provoked a confrontation in the bar.The gunslinger strangely re-enters the scene later,confronting Blane in his room(as if seeking vengeance which is \\"impossible\\")and Martin is forced to break in the door and shoot him \\"dead\\".<br />The incident gets Martin jailed and Blane has to come to his rescue,and the two officially become\\"outlaws\\".While sitting out in the desert contemplating their next move Blane is attacked and bitten by a robotic snake.The snake is eventually dispatched but it has left a couple of puncture wounds on Blanes arm,who isn't too impressed.Unbeknownst to the pair the technicians running the park are noticing more and more abnormal behaviour coming from robots throughout the complex.They suspect a kind of \\"virus\\" infecting the sub routines of their programming,but one they cannot put their fingers on,nor stop.The culmination of their worries comes to a head when a customer in Medieval World gets run through and killed during a sword fight.They try and shut the park down to no avail.<br />Martin and Blane decide eventually to return to town,tired and hungry,but are confronted by the gunslinger.Blane asks to let him take care of him this time.He draws his gun but the gunslinger is faster and more accurate and shoots him once,then twice....dead.Martin is gobsmacked and immediately runs for his life,but the gunslinger follows him...without let up.When Martin rides out of town,the gunslinger obtains a horse and does the same.Martin runs into a park worker out in the desert fixing his vehicle,who tells him there is no escape.Martin disagrees and rides off,soon after to hear two gunshots which kill the attendant.Martin makes it into Medieval World and down into a large vent.Down below he has found the central area from which the park is run and robots repaired.He discovers the park technicians presumably dead in a sealed room from which they could not escape after they shut down all power,in vain.He hides in the repair room and when the gunslinger comes in he throws acid on his face which diminishes how much he can see and detect.In another room Martin hides beneath a flaming rod on the wall and when the gunslinger locates him Martin sets him on fire.In yet another room Martin rescues a lady in distress from some chains,sits her down and gives her water,which instantly short circuits her.He is a-gasp as it was a robot.Just then the gunslinger comes in and falls to the floor,finally at its end.The film fades out as Martin sits reminiscing about the ads that prompted him to come to Westworld in the first place.<br />It is an intriguing plot,no doubt.To those thespians who think the more on screen time the better,think again.Yul Brynner had relatively fewer moments on the screen than his co stars,yet who do we remember to this day? Brynner of course.He played the steely eyed,emotionless gunslinger/robot to a tee.Just a glance from him could send chills and his demeanour(stiff back and walk)all added to his menace.Brolin and Benjamin play well their out-of-their-league characters.Watch for one of Star Trek's major players from TOS as Majel Barett plays a saloon madame.There are some \\"what was that's?\\" in this film,but one that baffles me is this:if the teckys are trying to restore power,cut off across the board,how is it that the computers are still running in the background and their consoles?<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1.The picture is clear and crisp but it does show its age at times and some parts are grainy.A new print should be struck and remastered,all being equal;but what ever is in Hollywood? There are no extras.<br />All in all a neat Sci-Fi film from the early 70s.It has a decent plot,a few holes but the kudos have to go to the screen and stage veteran who we recall the most;the mostest with the menace,Yul Brynner.et another room Martin rescues a lady in distress from some chains,sits her down and gives her water,which instantly short circuits her.He is a-gasp as it was a robot.Just then the gunslinger comes in and falls to the floor,finally at its end.The film fades out as Martin sits reminiscing about the ads that prompted him to come to Westworld in the first place.<br />It is an intriguing plot,no doubt.To those thespians who think the more on screen time the better,think again.Yul Brynner had relatively fewer moments on the screen than his co stars,yet who do we remember to this day?

B004QL7K6Q|5.0|I'm looking at all of the negative reviews on here and 90% of them are based on the graphic nature of the film and the fact that it's not for younger audiences... DUH!<br /><br />The film is rated \\"R\\", meaning anyone under 17 needs to be accompanied by an adult to see it in theaters or to purchase it in the store. If you don't want to watch a hilarious movie with shocking obscenity and nudity, go watch something else.<br /><br />I personally think \\"Wanderlust\\" is the perfect film for anyone who's questioned their life's path and I think the movie has some wonderfully understated moral themes about individuality versus group identity.<br /><br />Jennifer Aniston, Justin Theroux and Paul Rudd are all at their best while they're working together. It's also fun to see three giant movie stars doing a film that was not a sure-fire blockbuster guarantee.<br /><br />I say, if you're not a prude, see this film; If you are, go see another crappy remake of a fairy-tale or a movie about harmless vampires falling in love.
0143038419|5.0|I just want to say that I am so glad I didn't pay attention to any of the negative reviews of this book (after all isn't there enough negativity in this world?). I loved this book and am so happy with my purchase.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I read the first three books in this series one right after another. Every book is so good that I just did not want the story to end, and this book was no different. I would almost say that this third installment is the best one in the series so far. It is action packed and full of unexpected twists and turns.<br /><br />Clary is getting ready to leave for Alicante to find the warlock who can save her mother. Jace is adamantly against this decision. He doesn't want the Clave to find out what Clary is capable of or what really happened on Valentine's ship. In an effort to recruit Simon's help in deceiving Clary so she will miss the portal, the Institute is attacked by Forsaken and Simon is pulled through the portal with the Lightwoods. Underworlders entering into Alicante is strictly forbidden, and the Clave is immediately interested in the Daylighter. When Clary and Luke arrive to leave for Alicante, they only find Magnus Bane. He proceeds to tell them what happened, but only part of the story. Clary decides to put her new found rune powers to the test and tries to make her own portal. Luke finds her just as she is stepping through and into the world of the clave they go.<br /><br />I loved this book. I think I spent just about every moment I was awake and not working to read. It has action, suspense, love, and lots of twists. There is a very sad part in this book, but that is all I will say about that. The most disappointing part of this book is that it needs more Jace. This book puts so many pieces together. There were some parts that I thought Clary was annoying. She tends to just do whatever she feels like without thinking about how it will affect others, but at the same time she is more bad ass in this book. She isn't afraid of anything and will do anything to help the ones she loves.<br />I have to say that I have not liked Simon's character in this series at all until this book. He is almost a totally different person than he has been. It is nice to see that he accepts the way Clary feels for Jace and stops pining after her. He is a much better friend than jealous tag along.<br />Jace is wonderful as usual. We learn so much more about him in this book, and its beyond what you would think. It is nice to learn more about who he really is.<br /><br />This book is non-stop from the first page to the last. You can tell that at one time it was intended to be the last in the series, but the end is still pretty open-ended. Cassandra Clare leaves some questions hanging unanswered. I am excited to carry on in the series, and hope that it doesn't drag on or ruin the relationship between the characters.he accepts the way Clary feels for Jace and stops pining after her.

B005NKGEP2|1.0|I bought this on my Kindle because I was leaving for Europe and thought it'd be a fun plane read/get me excited for travel. What a disappointment. I forced myself to plod through the clunky prose and low-brow writing style (for example, overuse of obvious adverbs and cringe-worthy descriptions--like Julia's \\"crinkly\\"  smile at the end) since I paid for the thing. None of the characters, especially Kate, are endearing or interesting, and Kate's character especially I felt contradicted herself numerous times--acting how the author would imagine a stereotypical woman to act, rather than how we imagine stoic Kate herself. I found myself barely caring to solve the \\"mystery\\" or \\"intrigue\\" (the secret wasnt that exciting or mind blowing anyway). This is the first review I've written for Amazon, but I felt compelled to warn other potential buyers to disregard its high rating. Don't waste your $10!
B007XNAQLA|5.0|Seriously, there are times that people will get chills listening to this music.  Yes, it is some old RTF music.  But it is also old Stanley Clarke music and old Jean-Luc Ponty music.  And I have to hand it to these guys to stoop down to our level and deliver familiar music.  They didn't have to do this.  There would be a lot of people that would buy this music if they didn't recognize one thing off of it.  But, if you happen to love this familiar music as I do you'll love the way that they perform it live.  I read an article on how Chick Corea supervised the sound sampling and editing on a Yamaha synth to get just the right reproduction of the old sounds from the old RTF music.  And that's just the sound.  All of the musicians faithfully reproduce the whole piece of art but with a live feel and using modern recording techniques.  When I say that they didn't have to do this I mean they had to have the discipline to practice together enough to play this stuff just right.  And believe me, they do!<br /><br />Ok, so I'm a big RTF fan.  My iPhone plays Romantic Warrior when I wake every morning.  And I'm still kicking myself for not finding a way to get to Chicago (closest city to me) to see them when they toured last year.  So I was absolutely thrilled to hear that this music and video became available.  All I can say is that I really love this CD.  I was concerned that Al Di Meola wasn't playing guitar.  But Frank Gambale does a phenomenal job.  He was in Chick's Electric Band.  You know a guy is good when he can play the licks from the recording perfectly and then just thoroughly impress you when he's let go to do what he wants.<br /><br />And I don't think I've ever heard a fusion band that has ever had the power and tight licks of Lenny White and Stanley Clarke.  Of course both of these guys stand out on their own.  But put them together and you have the power of a rock band that can play circles around just about anyone.<br /><br />And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Jean-Luc Ponty.  This puts the icing on the cake.  His music and the RTF music just belong together.  When Jean-Luc doubles the guitar lines it just sounds WONDERFUL!  Of course he is just a great musician just like everyone else in this band.  But his style and music composition just fits.  All in all, this is one of my top choices in my large collection of music.  It's a very unique and rare piece of art.<br /><br /><edited - 7/15/2012>  I apologize.  RTF did perform in St. Louis during their tour.  So I'm even more lame for not going to see them.

0307887898|5.0|Besides giving me the tools to start my own company, The Lean Startup has changed the way I think about business where I currently work - it makes a lot of very 'standard' decisions seem very archaic, and shows that we could be (and probably are) spending (wasting!) a lot of time on things. You should get this book and read it well, so you can see what really needs to be done to make your business succeed. It was an easy read, and was clearly presented with great examples.

B007V508CC|4.0|I have been a Maroon 5 fan since [[ASIN:B00006879E Songs About Jane]], so when I popped Overexposed into my player, I was surprised to say the least. Overexposed has a very different sound than any of Maroon 5's previous efforts, and I will admit on my first listen, I wasn't blown away. On the second listen though, once the shock of just how different this effort was, I myself humming the very songs that I thought I didn't like. By my third listen, I was starting to pick out my favorite songs, and now I can say with full confidence that Overexposed is an excellent addition to Maroon 5's already impressive catalog.<br /><br />Once you get past how different it is, Overexposed has a lot to offer. The first two singles \\"One more night\\" and \\"Payphone\\", which are one and two on the album respectively, are excellent. The only tracks that haven't clicked with me are #3 \\"Daylight\\" and #8 \\"Fortune Teller\\". That means that the other 13 tracks are all winners, and that is better than average. Outside of the two singles, my stand out tracks would have to be #7 \\"Lady Killer\\", #10 \\"Tickets\\", #12 \\"Beautiful Goodbye\\", and #13 and #14, \\"Wipe Your Tears\\" and \\"Wasted Years\\" both of which are bonus tracks.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoy this album and can see myself adding it to my rotation of regular Cd's. I rate it as a definite buy.
1401923127|5.0|For over a century, many biologists have rejected Lamarckian ideas on how the environment might affect us biologically in ways that could be transmitted to our children. Lamarckian theory was developed fully in a book written in 1809. It was still extant when Darwin published the Origin of Species exactly fifty years later. The crux of the problem is that our genes containing DNA determine our physical and mental characteristics and the structure of DNA does not change in our lifetime, except through exposure to radiation or toxic chemicals.<br /><br />Although the structure of DNA does not normally change, its function is continually affected by RNA, which is sensitive to its environment. This is what Lipton's book is all about - how these effects on our cells are brought about. It is written in an accessible style by an eminent cell biologist, an expert in his field. I doubt that the book was ever intended as a `self-help' book, criticized by some reviewers, except insofar as it emphasizes the importance of exposing the body to as few toxic influences as possible and, as indicated by the title, it shows how belief and intention do affect the body. It thus provides a scientific rationale for the effects of placebos on the body, and for cases of spontaneous remission of diseases like cancer.<br /><br />There are some inaccurate statements in the book, as on p.195 in the statement: `Until 1975, the only geometry available for study was Euclidean'. In fact, non-Euclidean geometry dates from the mid-nineteenth century; but then, mathematics is not Lipton's field! However, I could find no errors in the biology, though again this is not my main field of expertise. The book is inspirational in encouraging us all to adopt a positive attitude of mind in the certain knowledge that there are biochemical processes that will thereby be enhanced. I suspect that those who are highly critical of this book are Darwinian materialists, to whom any suggestion that mind has any influence on the body is anathema.<br /><br />There is an extensive reference list and a good index.

B003X2O6KW|1.0|Sorry new age Hip Hop fans...THIS IS NOT HIP HOP! It's an album for the naive/unitelligent mind. Kanya ain't saying nothing and can't rap for diddly squat! Those of you who think he is great are narrow-minded! Oh and also I see bad reviews for the vinyl regarding the master but the album is so whack anyways! Dig up classic Hip Hop vinyl instead of this garbage then you won't lose!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|There comes a point in time where every reader bites the bullet and reads \\"the next big thing\\".  We all did it with Harry Potter, Twilight, and Hunger Games - but those series were aimed at young readers.  This series is NOT aimed at young readers and I'm pretty sure you won't find them at the school library.  These books aren't for everyone, in my mind they're really a niche book that took off and went viral.<br /><br />Romance books span a continuum from thinly-veiled porn (where there are spicy segments strung together with plotless drivel) to well-written literature with primarily sanitized romance - think of Jane Austen at this end of the segment).  I'm a big fan of the sexy writing genre, but also a bit of a stickler that the book be well-written and edited, as well as have well-developed characters and a great plot.<br /><br />Sooo, as others have described, the plotline is a bit thin and doesn't feature a strong heroine (which was the saving grace of the final two Hunger Games books, when Suzanne Collins ran out of plot).  The plot in this trilogy will take you through the first book, but sort of strand you in the second book.  If you want plot with your sex - try reading the Diana Gabaldon series; she excels at plot and sort of spoils one for a lot of other reading.<br /><br />The writing is average - not the grammatical mess generally seen in women's erotica - but certainly this is not a polished, take your breath away, book.  One wonders where the editor was during the publication process.  I think a good editor could have easily turned this into a page turner, and straightened out the writer's inability to move the story forward.<br /><br />I didn't love the characters. Ana appears to be in love with the sex and looks of Christian, but seriously, any book aimed at women should encourage their immediate dismissal of needy stalkers rather than looking for ways to \\"fix\\" them.  Reading this is a bit like watching a slasher movie, where everyone in the audience screams \\"get out of the house\\".  This book is attempting to sanitize a very toxic relationship.<br /><br />The saving grace is that EL James writes sex scenes well.  I mean very well.  Luckily the book strings together her strengths (loads of vanilla and kinky sex scenes) with short stretches of wince-inducing prose.  So if you are looking for some ways to spice up your love life, buy this book and take good notes.  Give it to your boyfriend, with the salient parts dog-eared.<br /><br />Is it worth the price of admission for the books?  The first one absolutely.  The same cannot really be said for the next two volumes.

B004QOB8SO|4.0|The only reason I didn't rate this 5/5 is the lack of extras; there's only 1. By now the BBC knows they have a hit on their hands, so they could throw us a bone to tide us over until Season 3 appears next year (we hope)! There are 3 of the most famous stores re-imagined: \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\", \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\", & \\"The Final Problem\\". The first 2 need to be seen at least twice to catch everything and understand where the characters are going; the last episode is so sad, it would be hard to watch more than once. If you liked season 1, buy this!
1451627289|4.0|The title of this novel, the cover, and the advertising all serve to make the reader believe that this is a story about a man who travels back in time to prevent the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.  And it's true that this is the mission that main character Jake Epping chooses to accept (or perhaps is somewhat coerced into accepting) early in the story.  However, master author Stephen King creatively weaves this intriguing setup into a larger context, providing Jake with several other motivations for his journey into the past.<br /><br />When the novel opens, we learn that Jake is a high school English teacher who spends his summers teaching adult GED classes.  A moving essay submitted by one of his adult students becomes a key plot point, as soon after, Jake learns of the portal into the past from Al, a local diner owner.  Al has made frequent trips back in time, and although he isn't sure how all of the rules of time travel work, but he does know this:  when he arrives in the past, it is ALWAYS September 9, 1958, and when he returns to the present (no matter if he has remained in the past minutes, days, or years), the amount of time that has passed is always EXACTLY two minutes.<br /><br />Al argues that preventing the assassination of JFK would have countless positive reverberations throughout the country.  Furthermore, he thinks Jake--young, healthy, and newly single--is the perfect person for the task.  For Jake, it means committing five years of his life, as he must live in the past in order to await the approach of 1963.  And during this time, the past (which doesn't really want to be changed, after all), does everything it can to get in his way, perhaps including allowing Jake to fall in love.  Jake's relationship with Sadie is another central plot element that is also crucial to the book's conclusion.  At the end of the novel, Jake is faced with a desperate decision:  choose love or save the world (the needs of one or the needs of many)?<br /><br />I've been a long-time Stephen King fan, and overall, I enjoyed this novel quite a bit; despite its length, I found it to be a relatively fast read, and I was completely engaged throughout the whole book.  However, there were just a few things that I didn't really like.  First, King has Jake monitor Lee Harvey Oswald, and he went into what I felt was an excruciating amount of detail regarding Oswald's movements and conversations with others.  Second, I didn't feel much of a strong connection with the character of Sadie.  The fact that she was a chain-smoker didn't help (I understand that this was common for the era, but it was still a turn-off to me), but I just never felt I had a clear sense of her character.<br /><br />So in conclusion, this may not have been my very favorite King novel, but I did like it and would recommend it.r />I've been a long-time Stephen King fan, and overall, I enjoyed this novel quite a bit; despite its length, I found it to be a relatively fast read, and I was completely engaged throughout the whole book.

B005LAIHSG|3.0|\\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" has everything that would make a great action adventure film, as far as its visuals are concerned. Inspired by the fairy tale everyone knows, the film has great photography, great production designs and great costumes, plus stunning effects. What it does not have is an engaging story, a heroine you relate to, and a director who knows how to tell a story.<br /><br />Kristen Stewart plays the titular heroine, who escapes from Charlize Theron's evil queen into the dark forest, where she encounters the huntsman (Chris Hemsworth). What follows is their adventures and romance. The film's adventure part is just average with several decent action set-pieces. The film is also supposed to be a love story, but there is no passion throughout the story.<br /><br />For all the best efforts from the leads, the main characters Snow White and the Huntsman remain uninteresting in this dull and boring in this revisionist take of the fairy tale, which does not know what it really wants to do. Over-the-top Charlize Theron plays Ravenna, whose motive (and method) of taking over the kingdom never convinces. Actually, none of the film's characters are really credible, except supporting characters of digitally rendered dwarfs played by veterans Bob Hoskins, Toby Jones and Ray Winstone.<br /><br />Modern-day retelling of fairy tales is nothing new. Perhaps you remember \\"Snow White: A Tale of Terror,\\" (1997) a \\"realistic\\" take on the famous story. The new version may have better visuals and designs, but sadly the filmmakers have forgotten to polish up the story.

0307730697|5.0|\\"Fearless: The Undaunted Couage and Ultimate Sacrifice of Navy SEAL Team SIX Operator Adam Brown\\" by Eric Blehm showed me the importance of praying for all of our soldiers and their families and giving them support and encouragement.<br /><br />This book was not what I expected.  It was much better and I did not want to put it down.  One of my favorite things about the book is how Adam's family wanted to be honest and real and tell his whole story.  Sharing Adam's failures and struggles can only serve to help others and show them that we can overcome the bondages of life and be free to pursue the things God made for us to do in this world.<br /><br />Seeing Adam persevere through the challenges and never see anything as a set-back, but as things that could be and would be conquered was encouraging.  We need more Adam Brown's in this world -- men who don't give up, men who seek the Lord and then live out their faith.<br /><br />I loved getting to know Adam's family and also his Navy Seal friends.  This book is written as an honest, real, and raw account of Adam's life.  You cannot just page through this book or you will find shocking descriptions and not understand them, you will find vulgar language (bleeped) and will not understand the context.  So either read the whole book or none at all.  This story is well worth reading and shows that one life following the Lord Jesus can be lived \\"fearless\\".<br /><br />Thanks you Waterbrook Multnomah for providing Fearless  free of charge by Waterbrook Multnomah for review purposes.  If this would not have provided I may never have read it and would have missed reading one of the best books of 2012.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I purchased this book knowing very little about the story (it was one of my amazon recommendations) and based on the positive reviews on amazon.

I can't wait to read more books from this author.

B005LAIH5O|4.0|After my utter disappointment in the \\"Clash of the Titans\\" remake, I didn't know what to think of its sequel. I felt like I could be a bit more forgiving of \\"Wrath of the Titans\\" because it was a sort of fresh start unlike the senseless retooling that was its predecessor.<br /><br />Thankfully, \\"Wrath of the Titans\\" did provide haters of the remake a jumping-on point to give this new tale of Perseus a chance. I choose to think of this movie as a sequel to the original 1981 movie. I know it seems ridiculous, but it's what I have to do to come to grips with this follow-up.<br /><br />The \\"Wrath of the Titans\\" Blu-ray is a worthy purchase for fans of Greek mythology and fantasy films. The movie itself is a step above the \\"Clash of the Titans\\" remake. It's full of action and the special effects are effective. A healthy amount of extra features, some hosted by Neeson and Worthington, will please consumers and add value for buyers.

0718157834|4.0|I thought this was a well-written and researched novel that kept me engaged. It tackled a difficult subject matter, namely the relationship between a carer, Louisa and a quadriplegic, Will. Louisa learns too late that she has actually been commissioned to `cheer' Will up and make him change his mind about going to Dignitas, a place where people may end their lives with dignity.<br /><br />Louisa leads a sheltered and small life in a twee tourist area, and Will had previously led a big and well-travelled life. The 2 characters make interesting contrasts and inevitably offer something to the other. I liked the part where the 2 don't get on at first and there are some funny and touching moments along the way.<br /><br />We also peek into the thoughts of Will's family, which is rather surprising, such as Will's unfaithful dad, who privately hopes his son would go to Dignitas so that he could leave his wife and be `freed,' and Patrick, Louisa's obnoxious boyfriend who is obsessed with fitness, and yet feels threatened by someone who can't even move his arms. The writing does get a little mawkish towards the end as Louisa tiresomely tries to convince Will that their love is worth living for when it is pretty obvious Will is not to be swayed. Perhaps the novel is not everyone's tastes, but it certainly makes you think about things taken for granted and also how the loss of physical function impacts upon more things than we realise, particularly relationships and the dynamics of the family.

B00004XPPE|2.0|This has a rep as a Cold War classic and I've heard a couple of film-nerks compare it to \\"Strangelove\\" but believe me, it doesn't even come close. Clunky, hack-handed direction turns the excellent cast into a parade of talking heads. Sidney Lumet was one of those \\"serious\\" old Hollywood directors who took on \\"important\\" themes and is revered for it now - but to me his work often comes off as quite wooden and by-the-book. If you gotta have your doomsday drama without Kubrickian humor then maybe try \\"On the Beach\\" or something... but skip this solemn turkey!

To quote my fave review here, if you're a \\"wannabe snob elitist\\" - or if ya just happen to have a brain tucked among yer other soft tissues - do not miss this! And BTW guys... Woody Allen copied Fellini, not the other way round.

0553801473|2.0|...or have forgotten most of it along the way.<br /><br />Where is the powerful story-smith that started this series?  Finishing this book was painful and I cheered when I finished the last page, and not because it was a grandiose finale, which it wasn't.  I was glad that I'd managed to wade through 950+ pages and emerge sane on the other side.<br /><br />While I am still interested in where the characters end up, I didn't enjoy their journeys in this book and need to put some serious thought into whether I buy the next one in the series or not.  Maybe two chapters in the entire book were enjoyable and left me wanting more, but the rest was a truly painful slog.

1596680296|5.0|I was a total newbie at sock knitting and this book has turned me into a dedicated sock knitter.  When I would look at a sock it just seemed like a total mystery and terribly difficult.  Not so!  I encourage anyone who is curious to buy this book and in no time you will have turned out your first pair.<br /><br />Once you have learned basic knitting skills, there are a few new skills you need to learn to knit socks: picking up stitches, short rows, and grafting, aka Kitchener stitch.  All of them are clearly explained.<br /><br />Ann's book is easy to use no matter who you are knitting for, man, woman, or child.  She gives you basic patterns for yarn gauge (stitches per inch), with sizes in parentheses.  Later in the book she has photos and graphs of lace and cables,  with ideas about how to incorporate them into the sock design, so that you can easily customise any pattern.<br /><br />When I decide to start a pair of socks, I photocopy the pages I need and then write my working notes on them.<br /><br />One slight criticism.  She does introduce the various needle options (double pointed needles, circular), but the instructions are based on dpn.  I don't like working with dpns at all, so on my first pair, I had some difficulty translating the instructions for needles 1-4 into my two circulars.  A nice thing to add to a future edition might be some sort of key or illustration that shows how the stitches are arranged on the two types of needle  after turning the heel.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book highly enough!

0143119680|1.0|I'm not sure I've ever read a book as popular as this one with more problems. I wouldn't even have come close to finishing it except for the whole accident / rubber-necking phenomenon.  It was THAT bad.  And so bad, that if I let myself, I could write a 50 page essay on its stupidities.  I'll refrain (although it's hard) and force myself down to three disaster areas that are small examples of the mess this book is.<br /><br />First - I realized with this sentence (on the opening page) that I was going to have problems with the writing: `The thin gold rim of his glasses sparkled in the dim light provided by the old bronze reading lamp that was attached to a shelf.'  Can a sentence get clunkier than that?<br /><br />And yet the opening set-up was decent. One of the world's brightest historians stumbles upon an odd 300 year old manuscript in an Oxford library.  She's a witch who loathes witchcraft and the book (magically) cries out to her to open it.  She doesn't.  She sends it back to the stacks, not wanting anything to do with it.  But thereafter, daemons and witches begin stalking her.  A vampire corners her in the library to question her about the book.  We have the start of a plot.<br /><br />Except we don't.<br /><br />In fact, there is no plot.  There is no black moment, no climax, no connection at all to the three-act play.  Our heroine and hero (the vampire of course) wander around with things happening, occasionally they are even relevant, but often they are not.  THREE PAGES were spent on a yoga class.  The heroine drinks massive amount of tea and wine.  She jogs.  They go for walks.  They talk (and talk and talk and talk, but never about anything interesting). Then towards the end, a group of nine vamps, daemons, and witches get together (I never did understand why), and what do they do to stay busy?  Play scrabble!!!!! (You think I'm kidding, but I'm not.)<br /><br />I have never read a book where so much space was wasted doing really stupid, boring things.<br /><br />Which brings me to my second area of complaint: Credibility.  The author touches on some interesting subjects: DNA, History (the love interest Vamp was good friends with pretty much every famous artist, scientist, and politician in history), ancient manuscripts, even a touch of religion.  But...<br /><br />On page 237 the heroine and vampire decide to go horseback riding (see point #1).  He asks the heroine if she can ride.  She responds: \\"I grew up in the country and have ridden since I was a child - dressage, jumping, everything.\\"<br /><br />Now considering dressage and jumping are like first cousins when it comes to horses, I'm not sure where the `everything' comes in.  But I could forgive that. On page 240 (the couple is still getting ready for their ride three pages later), the vamp gives her an expensive gift of riding boots.  The heroine's comment: \\"I'd never shown horses and had limited resources, so I had never owned a proper pair of riding boot (before).\\"  WTF?  So she can't afford boots, but she can afford lessons to learn dressage?  Because riding a neighbor's pasture-pet isn't going to teach you dressage.  Dressage is a discipline.  Lessons run $200 - $500 a month.  If she couldn't afford boots (and you can get cheap (but still proper) boots for under $150.00) how did she afford dressage lessons?<br /><br />And it gets worse...  They go for their ride.  The heroine describes her riding: \\"My calf pressed into her (the horse's) flank, just behind the stirrup and she broke into a canter.\\"  Okay...  So for her calf to press into the flank, the saddle must be sitting on the wrong part of the horse's body?  Because a horses flank is where the horses butt connects to the torso - in the back part of the horse.  It would be hard for her calf to even reach the flank without cranking her leg up underneath herself and moving so she is sitting behind the saddle rather than on it.<br /><br />And while all this is humorous to me because I like horses, what it really does is point out the research / authenticity problems that run throughout the story.  It's VERY easy to find horse people on the internet, and anyone who rides would catch these problems. If the author got so much wrong about horses (which are easy to research and there were plenty of other non-horsey examples of this kind of stuff), I can only imagine how she mangled the science and history, etc.<br /><br />Third - The relationship between the heroine and the vampire started out fun.  He was creepy and alien, she was wary.  But then they fell in love.  And apart from the fact that the entire relationship arc is a copy of Twilight (\\"<strike>Bella,</strike> Diana, I'm feeling very protective of you. But I want to drink your blood at the same time.\\"  \\"<strike>Edward,</strike> Matthew, I'm not afraid.  Why don't you come lay next to me in my bed and watch me sleep?\\" (Except as they were in their thirties, they were naked - no sex though for some reason.)).<br /><br />Diana is supposed to be one of the most brilliant historians in modern history and the youngest person to ever get tenure at Yale (she's in her early 30s), but every character in this book treats her like a five-year-old.  Matthew (the vamp) is constantly feeding her (human food) and putting her down for naps (you think I'm kidding about the naps, but I'm not.  I've never read a book about a heroine who was so tired all the time, but couldn't realize it without someone telling her.).  She isn't allowed to make any decisions herself, and he keeps secrets from her because he's worried she won't be able to handle the stress.  And his mother (another vamp) gives Diana a bath.<br /><br />When something dramatic does happen, Diana gets dizzy.  She faints.  Or she rushes headlong into the trouble because she's brave (throughout the entire book, the word `brave' seems to have been swapped out anywhere the word `stupid' would have worked better).  Matthew tells anyone who will listen how stubborn and amazing and `brave' she is, but then he sets up boundaries of where she's allowed to walk, who she may speak to, and when she needs to go to bed.  It's so awful, it's hilarious.<br /><br />Matthew is the leading world scientist in DNA studies, origin of the species, Norwegian wolves, (and one more thing, I can't remember).  He's also the head of a huge secret warrior guild and 1500 years old.  But when an actual even occurs that requires 'thinking' his mother calls for his brother to come make all the decisions.  When Matthew has girl problems, he calls his best gay-friend and they spend three days at a hunting lodge talking about their feelings (I kid you not). He never seems to get any of the story clues, but he's really good at growling in the back of his throat anytime anyone looks at Diana.  In terms of age, I'd put him at about 16.<br /><br />(Side note:  IMO, the only writers who managed to do a good job of portraying what someone who lived 150 - 2000  years would really be like are Anne Rice and Robin McKinley.)<br /><br />I could go on and on.  There's still the awful dialogue.  The random events that happen just when they are most convenient for the characters.  The dire warnings about what will happen if Diana and Matthew go visit (fill in the blank over and over again), but then when they do it, the vamp (usually it was a vamp), turns out to be mild tempered and their new best friend.  The fact that the manuscript mentioned in the beginning spends the rest of the book being mentioned in passing, but having no real relevance to the plot (or lack of plot, I should say). I'm going to stop now or I never will.<br /><br />My recommendation?  Only get this book if you're looking for a satire-that-isn't or can't resist a really good train wreck.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is an addictive time -killer that pushes you to keep trying to beat your previous time. I gave it only four stars because the music quickly becomes a bit monotonous after playing several games. This is wellworth its free price. In fact, it's better than a lot of paid games.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is. a good game only ifu could beat it! like go to fifteenth levels well its a good game
B0086700CM|4.0|after a while of playing this game boredom took over. there is nothing new it is always the same old jumps and slides. they should really get something new.
0345803485|5.0|I decided to purchase Fifty Shades of Grey after hearing all the positive buzz about it. I was not disappointed from the time  I started, to the end of the book. It leaves you wanting more. I would definitely recommend the trilogy to anyone.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|Amazing book with amazing characters.  Could not put this book down. The love story has you captivated the whole time.
1576875776|5.0|Good book for a Vivian Maier Fix at a great price. The blank pages don't bother me as much as other reviewers. I also didn't have any issues with the contrast.

I look forward to seeing more.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0083ZOELK Diary of a Body Painter]]

0763644765|5.0|This book was actually very helpful in motivating potty training. It was basically our main reader while sitting on the throne.<br /><br />It really helped my girls understand the whole process, and made them excited about it. After a while they regularly asked to read the book while doing the deed!
0307951529|4.0|I like very much Chris as a blogger. This book reflects his general thinking and gives us some perspective on how it is possible to be successful with a minimum funding in today's world. I liked very much the case studies and the glimpse into Chris's personal life as a nomad entrepreneur - very much into the Fourth Revolution. I did not put a five because for me it lacked the last spark to become a great, inspiring, reference book. A very good book on an important aspect of today's life and opportunities - not yet a great book. Looking forward to the next!
0316123587|3.0|I really can't say if this book should receive 1 star or 5 since I don't own it. I was looking at reviews to decide if I should buy it for my kids. I'm just wondering - the publication date of this book is listed as May 1, 2012. How can there be reviews dated April 22, 2012 if the book wasn't even published yet?
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|Bought the game tor $4.99...the next day it was free on Amazon.  I was hoping for a better HOG and mini-games.  This was ok.  Nothing exciting.  Graphics Okay.  Lots of dialogue.  Would be okay for $1.99.  More than that is overkill.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited Away quickly became my favorite movie of all time. It is a masterpiece. This film is utterly transportive - from the soundtrack to the setting to the spirits that populate Miyazaki's magical world, it draws you in and you never, ever want to leave. This is a story of a selfish, spoiled little girl who ultimately learns to have courage and pull her own weight to save her parents and the friends she makes along the way. She must work hard, learn to play by the rules (and break them), and trust her gut. Please treat yourself to this unique and special fairy tale. You will not be disappointed!
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Great game with a good story line. Looking for hidden objects is not always as easy as it seems. Hidding in plain sight comes to mind. I find it keeping my mind as well as my eyes engaged. That combined with the interesting story line makes it a hard game to put down.
0385534639|4.0|I loved this book. I imagine that everyone who reads it desperately wants a chance to become a reveur, and you can count me in. This is a magical place, and you will get totally lost in its wonder. I loved the characters; my only criticism of the book is that I would have liked to get to know more of them better. I hope there will be a sequel, and I rarely feel that way. I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this one.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game was the best game i ever played because it was different than the one on the apple series.
1400069289|5.0|This book is not only well researched it's easy to read and very interesting!  I highly recommend it for any reader.
0765316994|2.0|While I am a big fan of Mr. Scalzi, this novel falls short in almost every way.  Like many of his loyal readers, I had high expectations for this novel.  It is a concept ripe for parody, but ultimately nothing more than a concept.  It's cute, but not very entertaining and there are no laugh out loud moments at all in this book (very un-Scalzi like).<br /><br />The best analogy I can make is that it reminds me of a Saturday Night Live sketch that is funny for 5 minutes on TV, but then turned into an hour and a half movie and is still funny for 5 minutes.  I think Mr. Scalzi's editors let him down here.  Perhaps he has reached a level of success where no one around him wanted to state the obvious...this novel never should have made it to print and I hope it will not damage his brand going forward.

B005I6EU7U|5.0|I love the old style look of hardback books, the ones that are big and made of leather and that can last so many years on the book shelf. This is the reason why I bought the Tan Verso Prologue Case Cover for the Kindle Fire. I recently had the Micro Shell made by Marware. However, I wasn't a fan of the color and the case was getting really dirty, probably because it was white. Since I purchased the new case, I am very happy with it. The straps that hold the Kindle Fire are very secure and I believe they wont get lose over time, unless someone keeps stretching them out for some strange reason. The cover folds over the Kindle just fine for protection. I love the fact that it looks like I am reading an old book, but it's actually has close to a hundred book in it. So cool. Highly recommend buying if you like this look and want something to protect the Kindle Fire.
0345803485|2.0|I am not a fan of romance but after all the hype surrounding this trilogy I decided to give it a go. I almost put it down several times but I pushed on. Once I got past Anastasia's constant gushing, flushing and blushing I was able to actually appreciate the story and the concept behind it. There are a few far-fetched elements like her not having an email address (seriously???? A fourth year uni student) and the buildup is slow but those aside I think that her character is fairly realistic.<br /><br />She's a naïve girl who has never kissed a frog and suddenly meets a prince who confuses the hell out of her because of his different approach to a relationship.<br />The conflict between her desires and his made the reading interesting for me.<br /><br />As I said I don't do romance books but my interest was piqued enough in this area to read to the end. Am about to begin book 2 in the trilogy. Hope it's as interesting.
B005LAII1C|5.0|This is one of those special (ED) movies that doesn't come along very often. The story is original with a very familiar theme. Friendship. A story of a lifetime friendship that is deeply moving and the choices that we make to keep those special people in our lives. A friendship that knows no limitations on gender, race, or cotton fluff. OK, so basically it is a fart-joke movie with a hansom leading man and a smoking hot woman that makes him choose between his pot-smoking foul-mouthed teddy bear and her. You'll laugh so hard your sides will ache, and you will most likely be trying to get the soda out of your nose after it. Very much worth seeing, but it is very crude with a lot drug use, some really bad language and some of the funniest violence I think I have ever seen. This is an adult movie. I will be buying this as soon as it come out, and I may even go see it again in the theaters.
1475143389|5.0|Before I read this book, I looked on various websites for the optimal workout to do. I've looked at beginner's workouts, basketball workouts, etc. each one a little different. I've asked coaches, and they've also given me different workout plans.<br /><br />I was relieved to see all the information in one neat package in this book. I now know what to do, how to do it, and why to do it! If nothing else, this book has given me the confidence to make these lifestyle changes to become bigger, leaner, and stronger.<br /><br />I'll put these steps into action, and I'll let you guys know the results in a year or two!

B007N5YJWK|4.0|\\"The 39 Steps\\" wastes little time pulling you in. You're practically thrown right into the thick of things right from the start just like Hannay. As soon as your brain has accepted all that is transpiring, BOOM! Hannay is on the run for a murder he didn't commit. Much of the film follows him as he outruns the authorities; constantly checking newspapers, looking over his shoulder, and hiding in plain sight. It's how the film keeps its thrilling aspect alive its entire duration.<br /><br />It seems like even the film's flaws can be excused because the film is great anyway. Lucie Mannheim overacts to the extreme when she dies and the film has more than its fair share of outdated special effects. But this was also made in 1935 and there's much to appreciate for it being over 75 years old. Robert Donat is really spectacular in the film and his chemistry with Madeleine Carroll is extraordinary even if Pamela (the character Carroll portrays) is extremely hard headed and her actions are a bit frustrating.<br /><br />Despite the film being in black and white, you're still able to notice how fantastic both the lighting and camera work really are. When Hannay is first apprehended by two men who claim to be policemen, he's shoved inside of a car along with Pamela. There's this seamless transition from the inside of the car (after Pamela complains about having to spend half the night with Hannay) to an outside shot of it driving on the road as it drives over the hilly countryside and into the distance.<br /><br />\\"The 39 Steps\\" isn't exactly groundbreaking, but it's an extremely solid mystery thriller. The twist doesn't come out of nowhere, but it's still very clever. Hitchcock always managed to keep the audience guessing and always had them in the palm of his hand. \\"The 39 Steps\\" still accomplishes that. \\"The 39 Steps\\" is an enthralling thriller that looks fantastic for its age.<br /><br />Supplements on the Blu-ray include a new high-definition digital restoration, audio commentary by Alfred Hitchcock scholar Marian Keane, the 24-minute documentary Hitchcock: The Early Years, the 40-minute interview from 1966 entitled Cinema: Alfred Hitchcock from British broadcaster Mike Scott, the complete broadcast of the 1937 Lux Radio Theatre adaptation starring Ida Lupino and Robert Montgomery, new visual essay by Hitchcock scholar Leonard Leff, audio excerpts from Francois Truffaut's 1962 interviews with Hitchcock, original production design drawings, and an 18-page booklet featuring an essay by film critic David Cairns.<br /><br />\\"The 39 Steps\\" is now available on single disc DVD and single disc Blu-ray from The Criterion Collection.

Cannot give minus stars but can forsee the laughter on her banker's face. If success is measured by money this is a winner.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|I am sorry to say this but this movie could've been better produce, it was jumping back and forth in plot ideas and creatures that none of it really made any sense except for the engineers.  Then they throw a alien creature at the end answering none of the questions about the creatures themselves or nothing.
B005HWUCMC|4.0|If there's one thing Rihanna's good at, it's making music. Not only swifty, but quite often as well. Exactly one year after her 2009 effort \\"Rated R\\", RiRi debuted eleven more tracks all under the moniker of \\"Loud\\". This time around, Rihanna continues to refine her skills as a singer to a strong degree, and she also works to increase her diversity mixing in songs that have a fiery, rock edge (California King Bed), hip-hop/R&B (What's my Name? feat. Drake and Raining Men feat. Nicki Minaj), and she even throws in Caribbean influences in the catchy \\"Man Down\\". She shines her brightest, however, when she sticks to the sound that made her a star in the first place with the very successful \\"Only girl in the world\\" and my personal favorite \\"S&M\\", the latter of which is probably one of the best songs of her entire career. So she aims for improvement, however some things do get lost in translation. If the album name is \\"Loud\\", one would expect the album to be filled with bombastic pop and dance numbers that would make you turn up the radio and blast the speakers. True you will find yourself doing so, but not because of the volume. The songs themselves are not loud by nature, and several of them turn out to be more reserved than her previous efforts. One reason would probably be the fact that Rihanna didn't even pick up a pen to contribute to the song-making, she simply had others write songs for her and she, like any ol' pop star, sings them conviningly enough to please her fans. So no matter how strong this album is, it's impossible to deny that \\"Loud\\" is Rihanna's \\"Sell-out\\" album, made just so she can make more music and more money in the process. Why else would she agree to sing songs like \\"S&M\\" and \\"Love the way you lie part II\\", which have very significant meaning towards her public falling out with Chris Brown in 2009? But lucky enough for us, the content of this album is so strong it efficiently compensates for her lack of involvement this time around. In fact, if she would've spent a little more time creating soulful and meaningful songs like in \\"Rated R\\", this album would've been perfect.

0525478817|5.0|I am the type of teenager who doesn't like reading until I find the perfect book-any other book is torture to get through. I picked up this book and got into it almost immediately. I haven't finished it (about 50 pages away) but I thought this was such a fantastic book that deserved a review. I would recommend it for teens especially but probably not for anyone under 13. It does contain some language and sexual references but not too much. In the beginning I was so anxious for something to happen with Hazel and Agustus that I wanted to keep reading. The author is amazing and wrote the book so well that I could imagine everything without too much detail. Thanks John! Also, for anyone thinking about reading this book, its great if you haven't already realized.

B004QOB8SO|5.0|Sherlock is wonderful!  Well written, great characters, and riviting plots.  (Not to mention a cast that is very easy on the eyes).
B00846REIS|3.0|Its an obvious 50 shades copy from the name Christian Grey to Gideon Cross to the similarities between plot and character. many authors are trying to copy. but there is only one fifty shades :o) I did enjoy the book though but only because it brought me back to fiftys books.
0307730697|5.0|I bought this book for my husband and a copy for our son.  They both opened the book and could not close it.  I will be next to read it when I can.  An excellent well written book.  They both thoroughly enjoyed it although a sad ending.<br /><br />PatH
0385344228|3.0|This would have been a good novel but for the fact that it was telegraphed virtually from the beginning that the kid was guilty. Plus, the ending would have been a gazillion times better if the father had fulfilled his genetic destiny (?) made up for the sins of his father (?) the sins of his son(?) by being the one to kill the bad seed. Having the wife do it was a cop-out.
B003Y5H5C4|3.0|I actually watched this movie not knowing anything about this movie and just took it as is. I loved the story line and comedy. Later, I found out that it's not just a comedy but an action movie as well. The relationship between the characters aren't really that strong and some things don't make senses, but I still enjoyed it.<br /><br />Only after I saw the movie and liked it, I read other people reviewers. I didn't know this movie was based on a real life event. Good thing, because I would probably wouldn't had watched it then.<br /><br />------------Spolier Alert below------------<br /><br />What I didn't like was that the two kidnappers supposedly known how to make a bomb. No way. Those two are idiots and would first blow themselves up before they could ever wish to make one. But if we move on from that, then, I didn't like how one of the idiot's father actually died, but not because he was a hired hit, but because he was just trying to protect his son and home.<br /><br />At the very end of the movie, I didn't like how the pizza guy and his friends actually got to get away with the money. You would think I would had liked that because he was forced to steal it from the bank, but I actually thought it was bad for them to get the money. I thought they should had done the right thing and gave it back to the bank or the cops at least, but no. They decided to have them keep it. His sidekick was really dumb to say he going to quit his job. If they only have 100K and he gets half of that that's 50K. 50K doesn't buy a lot of things, it's not like they're rich or anything. lol<br /><br />If you take the movie for what it is and nothing else it's just an average funny movie and nothing more than that.

0307477479|4.0|Just got home today and the book was waiting for me on my bed! :) Thank God! The book is in great condition, I almost thought it was new! I read the first chapter and so far it is a good book. I have to read it for my summer reading assignment for school, other wise I honestly wouldn't be reading it but the time it took to get here, it's condition and everything makes this book a good buy for me nonetheless. Thank you :)
B004AX71EQ|5.0|I'm sure many considering this movie have seen the Death Wish series, or others like Brave One or Harry Brown. This one is different.<br /><br />Clive Selton (played by Gerald Butler) is an inventor and a family man.  His life is shattered by a home invasion that leave him injured and his wife and young daughter dead.  Due to legal problems with the evidence Nick Rice (played by Jamie Fox) the prosecuting attorney decides to play it safe and go for a plee deal that sends one of the two accomplices to death row, in exchange for a lighter sentence for the assailant who did the actual killing.  Feeling betrayed by the system, we see Clive walk away from the scene.  Ten years later, the assailant sent to death row is executed, but the system has been corrupted and instead of a painless execution he dies in agony.  The second assailment is captured by Clive and tortured to death.<br /><br />What follows is a chess match between Nick and Clive who has been driven mad by grief.  People attached to the case begin dying, wile Clive, who is in solitary confinement, is the only logical suspect.  Nick has to try to get ahead of this deranged mastermind as he watches one associate after another murdered.  He also comes to the realization that he is the creator of the monster he now faces.<br /><br />The movie is well put together and will provide heart pounding suspense.<br /><br />One note:  The special edition is a little more graphic than the original.

B000002MFE|3.0|The Unplugged fashion has much to enjoy from the many artists who recorded in this style.<br />While the blues is not my favourite genre the best songs are Tears In Heaven and Old Love.<br />Layla is very different from the original version and therefore well worth hearing.<br />Most Eric Clapton fans will want to buy this album to hear some of his less known songs from a new perspective.

We love this toy!
B000002LJW|3.0|Eric Clapton has been at the top of the tree since the mid 1960s, since which he has covered many genres of music, however in his heart he loves the blues best.<br />For me Bad Love is the best track, this includes support from Phil Collins, on other songs Robert Cray, Jim Keltner and George Harrison help out.<br />Not his greatest album, but blues rock fans are likely to enjoy it.

1908117230|4.0|Great book, great pictures, but not a book for beginners .Pierre Herme uses the Italian Meringue method - that is no piece of cake - because it pasteurizes the egg whites. If you have a shop and you sell macarons you should certainly choose this method. Otherwise, you can use the Swiss Meringue method, that is much more easier. I am not a pro and I am still trying to get my macarons right. It takes time, patience and repetition, repetition, repetition, in order to master the thecnique, so do not get upset if your first bunch of macarons does not look like the beautiful pics on this book and keep trying!

B005LAIGSM|2.0|If this movie was made in the 1950's and trust me, many of the character sensibilities and melodramatic plot turns feel of that period, then this old-fashioned 2012 romantic drama would be marketed as a \\"date movie\\", one you would have seen in a drive-in as you try to figure out if you're going to make it to third base with your date. It would have starred Troy Donahue and either Connie Stevens or Suzanne Pleshette with plenty of picture-postcard scenes as they decide should they or shouldn't they.  Granted, this film goes well past that question but still ponders the enduring power of love against the odds of amnesia, overbearing parents, a snarky ex-boyfriend, and a bohemian lifestyle that still seems quite comfortable. Credited to no less than three writers - Abby Kohn, Marc Silverstein, and Jason Katims - and directed by Michael Sucsy, the story is based on the true experiences of a devoutly Christian couple who amazingly went through the trials depicted here, and even though the religious element could have brought an intriguing angle to a more audacious filmmaker, it's removed in this version to broaden its audience appeal. It also makes the whole venture feel more manufactured and ultimately generic.<br /><br />Paige and Leo are an attractive pair of kindred artistic soulmates who fall desperately in love. Everything is beyond euphoric for them until a snowstorm forces a truck to skid uncontrollably and sends Paige headlong through their front windshield right after she unbuckles her seatbelt to smooch Leo. Paige later awakens from a coma to see Leo at her bedside and thinks he's her doctor. It turns out the collision has erased the last five years of her memory. She doesn't remember not only meeting and marrying Leo but also leaving law school to become an avant-garde sculptor and vegetarian. We find out she has completely forgotten her estrangement from her status-conscious parents who want to see her reunite with Jeremy, the businessman fianc&eacute;e she had dumped before even meeting Leo, a struggling music producer. Consequently, she starts to revert back to her earlier self, and it is apparently up to Leo to reignite the chemistry that brought them together in the first place. If the set-up wasn't based on reality, there could have been the makings of an interesting psychological thriller or even a dark comedy, but the whole story is played straight-up for maximum tissue usage.<br /><br />Although I am beginning to appreciate his comic skills elsewhere ([[ASIN:B0081L37Z0 21 Jump Street]]), the lunkish Channing Tatum has to work overtime to come across as anything more than this generation's Troy Donahue as the tortured Leo, but the by-the-numbers script, especially his psycho-babble voiceover, works heavily against him. Rachel McAdams showed early promise in [[ASIN:B000IZA426 Mean Girls]], but with few exceptions, her career has lately been a series of romantically hazy heroines caught in soul-searching dilemmas ([[ASIN:B000YMM3CC The Notebook]], [[ASIN:B0030RZEKG The Time Traveler's Wife]]). Her Paige whether in before or after modes is no exception to this increasingly tired pattern. The normally likeable Scott Speedman is relegated to the cardboard role of resentful suitor as Jeremy, while Sam Neill is all greed and bluster as Paige's father. A surgically altered Jessica Lange barely registers except for one late scene with McAdams that finally moves the plot toward its inevitable resolution. Life-changing accidents have figured prominently for as long as cinema has been around from [[ASIN:B001ILTUL0 Magnificent Obsession]] to [[ASIN:6304765266 While You Were Sleeping]], but previous executions better reflected their times or at least situations that feel more realistic than the true-life story here.mped before even meeting Leo, a struggling music producer.

B006R8GK2Q|4.0|it has great puzzles for hidden objects. Not terribly hard but not easy. The story is different too which makes it interesting.
B007Q1VUFA|4.0|My impression after two listens is that (a) his backing band sounds like a Dead cover band, and (b) Chris Robinson could have made this album in his sleep.  Don't get me wrong, it sounds great ... four stars great.

1582701709|3.0|It is up to the reader to believe what the book features as \\"The Secret\\", but in my personal case after looking for an opportunity to make an extra income out of my ordinary job, I focused my mind in the way the book suggests, and such opportunity, a good one to pursue, showed up 6 months later. I am going to keep it in my e-reader as a source of inspiration and reference
B00632HWOG|4.0|i enjoy it. it works fine i get all my emails, and the best thing is that it play a ringtone and notifies you when you get a message. the only problem is it does take up a number for notfications. so if i get a email it will not have a &quot;1&quot; next to &quot;(your name)'s kindle&quot; but when you tap it it is there. hard to understand but still a great app.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|We seem to be in a trend where books about magic are a \\"thing\\" now; from Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell to Harry Potter, from The Magicians to The Prestige, books about magic and the people who practice it, learn it, and compete using it seem to be a trend of sorts. And while one can't help but feel that each of these books is drawing from the others and covering some of the same ground, when the books are as rich and involving as The Night Circus, I'm completely fine with this trend continuing. Nominally, The Night Circus is about the titular circus, a collection of wonders and magic that is only open at night, and the chapters which simply wander this menagerie of mysteries are worth the price of admission in of themselves, as Morgenstern immerses you in a circus that never existed but makes you feel as though you've been there yourself. But even more than the circus, there's the story, which revolves around two old magicians who challenge each other using their apprentices - in this case, an unexpected daughter and an orphan boy chosen for unclear reasons. Feuding magicians are nothing new, but the competition here - which is compelling unclear in its guidelines - is a unique one, and the dynamic is something I've not seen in stories of this sort, turning The Night Circus into something more tragic and profound than just another wizardry story. This is Morgenstern's debut novel, and as you might expect, it's not perfect - the secondary characters aren't as fleshed out as you might like, and the ending is more opaque than she intends it to be, I believe. But small gripes notwithstanding, I was absolutely captivated by The Night Circus, from its mysterious houses to the cabinet of curiosities that is the circus itself, all the way to the relationship at the core of the novel. In short, The Night Circus is a fantastic debut, and it leaves me eager to see what Morgenstern does next.
B0067QPVJ6|1.0|Wow, this movie is awful. Not at all like the classic film from the 70's. It relies completely on CGI and gore. I was bored, to say the very least. Watch the real, John Carpenter version. It's scary as all get out without relying on CGI only. Save your moolah!
B000000WA4|5.0|...about which I feel strongly enough to write a review.  That in itself says more than anything else I could say.  Indeed, words fail me when I try to describe the music on this album.  Inspired, genius, masterpiece, celestial, epic...  Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness is in a class all by itself.  Of a time, yet timeless.  Beautiful and doomed.  Thank you Billy, James, Jimmy, and D'arcy.  Love you all.
B007V508CC|1.0|Apparently I'm not the only one laughing at this band's surprising ability to survive as long as it has.  A big thanks to Urban DIctionary for the following:<br /><br />\\"The band that Lance Bass and George Micheal have erotic fantasies to. Words cannot describe how terrible this group is. They call themselves Funk, but sound more like downs-syndromed Reggae laced with mainstream Pop. Their fanbase consists of poor, helpless junior high school girls who don't have souls.\\"<br /><br />\\"A shockingly poor attempt at anything other than repetitive, unimaginative, bland noise. It can only appealing to that unfortunate bunch of O.C. and Dawson's Creek loving sub-humans.  Busted-esque is a compliment!  How Hollywood has ruined a generation!\\"<br /><br />Stop making us all look like idiots and stop supporting this band!  Marron 5 is the sole reason the rest of the world hates America.
B007ZKY7XO|4.0|While I may be in the minority to think that \\"Night Work\\" was more a failure than not and the Scissor Sisters' least successful effort, I am pleased to say that \\"Magic Hour\\" is a nice rebound.  I didn't have high expectations for \\"Magic Hour,\\" but by any standard, I enjoy this CD and consider it worth listening to.<br /><br />I've come to realize that contrary to the early expectations that the Scissor Sisters set with their strong debut, this is not a band that one can (or should) look to for groundbreaking ideas.  Instead, they are assimilators who walk on ground tread by others, and then recycle others' ideas through their own sensibilities.  A lot of \\"Magic Hour\\" sounds like something you've heard somewhere else, and only a little bit of it sounds uniquely Scissor Sisters.  Still, I found this CD a lot more enjoyable, less forced, and less uptight than \\"Night Work,\\" which I really did not care for.<br /><br />The strongest tracks are \\"Baby Come Home,\\" \\"Keep Your Shoes On,\\" \\"Let's Have A Kiki,\\" \\"Self Control,\\" and \\"Somewhere.\\"  The weakest track (by far) is \\"San Luis Obispo.\\"  The lead single, \\"Only The Horses,\\" is a weak song that sounds overtly derivative without any individuality.  Still, the highs on \\"Magic Hour\\" more than offset the few lows.<br /><br />Overall, I rank the Scissor Sisters' CDs as follows:<br /><br />4) Night Work  (3 stars)<br />3) Magic Hour  (4 stars)<br />2) Scissor Sisters  (4.5 stars)<br />1) Ta-Dah  (5 stars)

B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is amazing! So far I've made it to level 14 and haven't spent a cent ( by the way I'm 11). To get out of the game, simply hit the stuff button when you are at your village and the bottom arrow comes up,  click it,  then clicking home,  ta -da you made it out. So stop being weird about the game, many games have it where you could buy stuff off it like points. Considering that,  there is almost nothing wrong with this game ( I include almost for the people who don't believe me). The game isn't a scam. If your son/daughter/or whatever spent tons of money,  maybe you should talk to them about it instead of blaming the game.
0547569653|1.0|I am very unhappy with the condition of the book I received. This does not fit the condition by which I purchased. The book looks as if it was dropped in a pile of black, chalky dust that has stuck all over the pages and cover. I would like to know how you are going to resolve this issue? I am very disappointed in this.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Wubbanubs are highly necessary for NICU babies. It gives them a distraction, something to play with and snuggle while developing the sucking reflex. Bought this as a gift, but would get this for my next baby if she/he were also in the NICU. Also great for babies once home as a toy, even if they abandon use of the pacifier part.
0439023521|4.0|I found the concept behind this to be a tad similar to The Running Man. However pretty decent story otherwise. Would have liked it a bit darker but that's just personal preference. Good read would recomend. Especially being a woman I thought the main character was life-like.
B008COII1Y|3.0|This was a movie I was really looking forward to actually. The trailers for this were pretty awesome. I feel the movie fell a bit short though. The setting was very grim and dark, which I enjoyed. The two main characters were approachable, and I especially thought Isaac was pretty cool actually. I was hoping for more from Bill Moseley, who is one of my favorite actors, but they really didnt devote enough to his character in my opinion, and his last scene in the movie was especially anti-climactic.<br />I feel this movie had a lot of strong points, but where the movie really failed was in the pacing. You could easily walk away for twenty minutes, come back, and not really miss anything of any real import.<br />Some positives, outside of the acting, which was pretty good overall, was the way in which the zombie outbreak was explained. I thought that to have been particularly well thought out.<br /><br />Anyways, overall I feel this was a middling effort that was good, but failed to live up to its potential. Still, it's worthy of a viewing to be sure.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game reminds me of the old fashion Mario brothers game. it is a 2d side scroller.  lots of fun for all ages!
B0086700CM|5.0|It is very fun and a good game for all ages and also its very challenging so people can get the trill and excitement of a real app game.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Just wanted to reassure anyone who is reading this that I am a woman. . After reading the book, I would never read a review on this book from a man. Let's face it, they have no insight into the feelings of the heroine of the book.  I really didn't want to read it, because of all the negative reviews!!! But, because of all of my friends and family constantly telling me how good it was, I bought it on the spur of the moment. I read 9 chapters in 3 hours and I still didn't want to put it down! I do not consider myself a literary genius as I have not read many books, apart from school books as I do have a considerable college education. With that being said, this book is intended for the audience it was intended for. And as far as the other negative reviews...blah..blah..blah. Come on people, just like Anastasia, you are overthinking things. Who cares that the characters are unbelievable and that Christian is a billionaire at such an early age. That's why it is called fiction. And all of the hypocritical reviews are just laughable!!! Either you like it or you don't!  And yes, I thought the book was written very well !!  I have read a few other top sellers over the past couple of months, and they are no comparison. This book has been my favorite by far!  The writing, the characters, and yes...the subject captivates you and keeps a hold on you!! I will be purchasing another kindle for myself as my husband is constantly griping because I have taken his Fire over, and as soon as it comes in I will be purchasing the other 2 books in this series.
B00005JKCH|4.0|I liked this movie. My superhero of choice is Superman, being a huge fan of \\"Lois and Clark's\\" Dean Cain and later \\"Smallville's\\" Tom Welling. So I decided to give Spiderman a try. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it. Not knowing anything about the background of the Spiderman legend, I felt that the movie was a good mix of both explaining how Peter Parker became Spiderman and a full-length plot of his first encounter with a true villain. I normally don't like when movies these days rely too much on CGI, but I think that's a little bit unavoidable in a movie where the main character is jumping from building to building using just a few strands of a web! There was a pretty decent balance of fake stuff and plot. I'll always prefer movies based on acting (but that is just me; a lot of people love action movies). But I have to say a superhero doing these things is so much better than watching ordinary human beings doing impossible things like fighting on top of a moving train or dodging bullets!<br /><br />One thing I have to note is that Mary Jane Parker does not hold a candle to Lois Lane as the hero's girl. And Clark Kent has a much better conscience. But all in all a pretty good movie. I also enjoyed Spiderman 2. Spiderman 3 was a little bit overdone, I thought. Three villains and three plots at the same time, or something like that. Too much for one movie.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I got this app through the free paid app a day program on amazon. At first I was skeptical but once I opened it surprised me. The layout is beautiful and easy move around. The app provides more information than any other weather app and all in a clear easy to understand method. On the last update the radar maps ran all the citys together making them difficult read. I contacted the support through the support option in the app. I was contacted back the same day. After a couple email exchanges ( including some screen shots ) they send me new app. I installed it and everything was perfect agian.<br />Great App. Great people.<br /><br />Larry

B0055EAJ7A|2.0|my review is different because I enjoyed the 3d quality and the movie was decent . my grip is with amazon.com sending me the limited 3d edition with no slip cover artwork. I called amazon.com and they sent an replacement the very next day and still no slip cover . if I go to target, walmart, best buy, or frys it comes with the slip cover . I have never had any issues or returns with amazon.com , but I wanted the slip cover artwork for collectors reasons . I kept the 2nd thor 3d blu ray without the slip and sent the 1st one back, but sooner or later I'll just get it again from best buy with the slip cover when it goes on sale. something so small but big in disappointment .
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was my first taste of Flynn.  I was entranced....in part, perhaps, because I am a psychotherapist and found myself nodding repeatedly as she plumbed the depths of human need and darkness.<br />The only somewhat unbelievable - but certainly not impossible - part of the novel was the intra- and interpersonal insight each spouse developed that kept them married.<br />I am convinced that Nick and Amy Dunne are still together...balancing, like well-trained tightrope walkers, their deep need for, and distrust of, each other.<br />Flynn's writing style is enviable.  Taut, tight, terse...in spite of the 'time traveling' and varying POV's.<br />I went on to read Sharp Objects, (Oh my dears, what a disturbing read.  Delightful.), and am about to start Dark Places.<br />I will read all future Flynn works, and if I ever need a therapist who can take me all the way down to where the toad squats, I'll be contacting Gillian.

B000ETQR3Q|5.0|First off, this is an amazing gun. Its clip system is one of the best I've seen from Nerf; it even has a spare spot for an extra clip.  It is also very durable, I've dropped this thing on asphalt at least 50 times, and it works just as well (if not, better) as when I first got it.  It has one of the longest ranges of Nerf guns, and they (Nerf) actually made it extremely easy to modify.  So naturally, I get irritated when I hear people talking about how it doesn't work.<br /><br />People complain about how the pistol at the end doesn't attach.  Don't use it on longshot, it make the darts go shorter distances and makes it extremely bulky.  It's better not to use it, or you can use it on its own.<br /><br />Another thing that irritates me is when people complain how it jams a lot.  Please, read the directions and make sure you're using it right before you go complaining.  It is probably jamming for one or all of these reasons:<br /><br />1. People are using torn up darts.  If you use a dart that is coming apart (I've seen people try to use darts that have no tip) or that has been chewed up by your dog, it will jam.<br /><br />2. People overstuff the clip.  The clip for the longshot is meant to hold 6 darts (Longshot CS-6, six!!!), and it will actually work fine if you put in 7 darts.  Plenty of people I know have tried to put in eight darts, and it jammed.  So yeah, if you try to put eight darts in a six-dart clip, it will jam.<br /><br />3. People use the wrong kind of darts.  It says at the top of the directions: USE ONLY DARTS DESIGNED FOR THIS PRODUCT.  That means the streamline darts that came with the longshot.  If you disregarded the directions and put in suction cup darts or something, yeah, it will jam.<br /><br />To summarize, this is a good product.  Don't grade it low just because you can't use the wimpy pistol on the end, or can't read simple instructions.  And if it does jam, take out the clip, and load the gun without a clip.  Then fire, there might be adart stuck in there that will shoot out.  So please, make sure you're using the gun right before you go putting it down.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I enjoyed every bit, even when Abby got on my last nerve. I love a book that lingers in your mind days after you finish it. Job well done Jamie!
B000IJ79WU|1.0|not long ago i reviewed the &#34;director's cut&#34; of DAREDEVIL, in which i was happy to be able to report that the formerly below-par film was actually stronger for the facelift. i am sorry to now have to report that it doesn't always work out so well.<br />the Superman films were probably my very first &#34;favorite&#34; movie(s), so they've been a sort of grand obsession. as such, i've heard how SUPERMAN III was flawed for prioritizing guest star Richard Prior, and how SUPERMAN IV set it's reach a bit beyond it's grasp and ended up &#34;half a movie,&#34; to use a bit of critic jargon. but i've never heard before now that anything was wrong with Episode II. quite the contrary, i've frequently heard it cited in company with the likes of BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, THE GODFATHER PART II, and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. such venerated critics as Janet Maslin, Roger Ebert, and Leonard Maltin considered it a more than worthy follow-up, and no less an authority than Christopher Reeve declared it his favorite installment. (in light of which, Donner's dedication of his vandalism to Reeve's memory is particularly grotesque.)<br />why? simply put, because it already worked!!! the theatrical &#34;cut&#34; of SUPERMAN II is an unimpeachable masterpiece, indeed the high-water mark of the franchise. so there's no way around it: this whole sorry undertaking boils down to &#34;Dick&#34; Donner's sour grapes.<br />producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind fired Donner after the first episode, and the question of just what led up to it has become the stuff of legend. consider the obtuse but persistent rumor that if the first film had tanked, the Salkinds would've &#34;punished&#34; Donner by forcing him to finish the second film. (that doesn't even make sense, because there IS no sequel to an unsuccessful movie.) well, as Donner directed bits and pieces of II almost simultaneously with I, he felt he deserved, lobbied for, and finally got the chance to present the movie he would've made, had he not been displaced by that &#34;upstart&#34; Richard Lester.<br />only the truth is the other way around: this monument to Donner's ego could not of cast Superman in a less flattering light if it had been directed by Lex Luthor!!<br />you find yourself wondering what the hell Donner was thinking right from the get-go. it's no particular heresy initself to remove the opening bit about the terrotists at the Eiffel Tower, but the thing is, Donner has no similar crisis with which to replace it. this dooms what's supposed to be a fantasy/adventure movie to get off to a hopelessly limp start.<br />also, consider that one of the iconic moments - Zod and his cohorts use their heat vision to displace the faces of Mount Rushmore with their own - is itself displaced with a ho-hum shot of the Washington Monument being pushed over. this is roughly equivalent to removing the &#34;all the gin joints in all the towns&#34; line from CASABLANCA. no, it's worse: it's like trading in Richard III's &#34;winter of our discontent&#34; speech for something like &#34;hey, how's it hangin?&#34;<br />if that's not sacrelige enough for ya, Superman actually destroys the Fortress Of Solitude!! why would he do such a thing? the only readily perceptible possibility is that Donner assumed it would look cool. i hate to burst your bubble, Dick, but no, it doesn't!!<br />yet another area where Donner's judgement lags is the pivotal scene in which Lois Lane confirms that Clark Kent is indeed Superman. here, completely out of the blue, Lois simply produces a gun and shoots him. the scene deserves oblivion, if only for the insipid proclamation, &#34;if you'd been wrong, Clark Kent would be dead.&#34; (all together now: &#34;ya THINK?&#34;) not only does it lack the poetic whimsey of Richard Lester's sequence of events - Clark actually manages to painstakingly convince Lois she's imagining things, only to trip and land in a fireplace - but Fate stepped in to make it even hokier: Lester recognizing that the scene could be improved upon and scrapped it, so Donner now has to settle for unrefined screen-test footage!!<br />you could perhaps argue that every objection yet registered could be explained away as a matter of personal taste, but not the remaining ones. the two that do the REAL damage follow...<br />Donner's pride-and-joy in this undertaking is &#34;lost&#34; footage of Marlon Brando as Jor-El, who was originally slated to mentor Superman the way his mother ultimately did. no particular heresy initself: the footage is admittedly an interesting novelty, even if history has proven that Jor-El hardly makes-or-breaks the film. what makes it such a jarring, indeed sinister, development is that Donner delivers it with an attitude of pointed, unabashed sexism. &#34;the story arc is supposed to be Superman an' his FAAAATHEEEEEER!!&#34; he bawls in his commentary, like an errant child being deprived of a favorite toy. personally, i've always perceived Lara as a great teacher, a person of great wisdom and regality like, say, Galadriel in LORD OF THE RINGS. but it turns out Donner has always seen her as a vacuous trophy bimbo, the Anna Nicole Smith of Krypton.<br />in practice she is not only just as capable, but probably better suited, as Mother usually is with matters of the heart of the sort that come up here. (as the &#34;Beav&#34; once said, mothers are always better for mushy stuff.) i have no idea where Donner got the obtuse idea that she couldn't teach her son diddly-squat and wouldn't want to anyway, but one thing's for sure: he's gonna have significant hell to pay if Gloria Steinem or Gloria Allred ever see this.<br />the other most significant wound inflicted by Donner is the preposterous new anticlimax of an ending. Superman again rewinds the world...this time going all the way back to the beginning. so basically, even within it's own &#34;reality,&#34; the whole damn movie NEVER HAPPENED!! just like when that whole season of DALLAS turned out to be a dream! say what you will about Richard Lester's &#34;magic kiss&#34; ending, at least it was neither retread nor cop-out!<br />(i might as well admit it: i've always HATED it when writers or directors invalidate their stories in this fashion, so this is easily where Donner disappoints me the most. if this had been his one and only alteration i would still be just as cross.)<br />ultimately, the easiest way to explain the situation is that of the two, Richard Lester just happened to be better suited to take the story where it needed to go at this point. (after all, anyone who's worked with The Beatles can't be all bad.) Donner is a tremendous talent, but facts are facts: Lester brought heart to the film, Donner induced cardiac arrest.<br />nor is there any question of where Donner misstepped: he let his ego swell. Donner is not - repeat, NOT - the auteur here. the SUPERMAN franchise is the Salkinds' &#34;baby,&#34; not his. how the hell did he left himself forget that?<br />i'll always be grateful to Richard Donner for directing the first SUPERMAN, as well as for directing episodes of some of the greatest tv series of all time, including THE TWILIGHT ZONE, THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E., WILD WILD WEST, GILLIGAN'S ISLAND, and GET SMART. but lest you forget, he also directed Richard Pryor's effectively pro-slavery &#34;comedy&#34; THE TOY.<br />so let The Record show that i still admire the man's talent, if not his judgement. i'm pretty sure i'll forgive him (i daresay i already have), but i'm still prayin' to God he never gets his hands on Lester's other masterpiece, A HARD DAY'S NIGHT.crapped it, so Donner now has to settle for unrefined screen-test footage!! you could perhaps argue that every objection yet registered could be explained away as a matter of personal taste, but not the remaining ones. the two that do the REAL damage follow...

B005LAIH3G|5.0|I have been a fan of the the John Carter novels since I was a young kid. I think that if you are familiar with the novels and liked them, then you will like this movie. I am not sure why it did so badly on the screen but I suspect a lack of familiaraty and publicity is likely. The title doesn't tell much about the subject matter and there is some great competition for audience dollars. The movie captured the essence of the novels quite well even though it would have been impossible to cover all the adventures in the novels. Too bad there probably will not be a sequel because the novels had a lot of content for story telling.

B007Y6OZE0|4.0|If you've been a fan since Smash, like me, then there's no reason to not purchase this album. No surprises here, the sound and setlist of songs closely follow the pattern Offpsring established with Ixnay on the Hombre (and in my opinion Days go By is consistently as good through and through as Ixnay and Conspiracy of One). Don't let the title track and lead single fool you - this album is much, much better than that. And even though there are a couple of stinkers here, at least none are as bad as the pseudo-ballads of Rise and Fall, \\"Kristy Are You Doing O.K\\" and \\"Fix You\\". There's a reason Offspring have achieved lasting success even though most 90's bands have disintegrated. They deliver quality, catchy songs that will give you a spring to your step and bring a smile to your face. Days go By delivers!
B005TBWN0K|5.0|This app does what its supposed to and makes it simple to add pictures to notes. Its nice to be able to doodle something on your mind or to add something directly on to an existing picture. Combined with evernote its really useful.
B008B3H4VQ|4.0|The first 6 songs are worth the price of admission. Trademark, catchy choruses layered over big sounding hard rock/electronica. What's not to love, really? But then the momentum hits the skids, and the remaining tracks feel like warmed over, unused tracks from \\"A Thousand Suns\\". And I liked the previous album. But I'm not sure they had enough material to fill an entire new album. Could be a consequence of releasing this so soon after \\"Thousand Suns\\". If you were turned off by their new direction last time around, don't expect to be brought back into the fold here. I appreciate the maturity of where they are now artistically. They still sound amazing! So I would give the first half 5 stars, and the second half 3 stars. Either way, it's worth owning.
B0025KVLTM|5.0|Well, what can I say about this album that hasn't been said already in the nearly 50 years since it was released? What are some good words? Important? Epic? Groundbreaking? Try all of the above. Sgt Pepper's is one of those few watershed albums that not only lives up to it's reputation, but actually exceeds it. It was the product of the Beatles finally quitting the road and fully committing themselves to making good music in the recording studios. It made all the difference too. Every song on this album is diverse, ranging from pure pop, to early rock, from playful psychedelia to what I've always termed the most unusual song ever made (that being We Were Talking). Despite the diversity, every song perfectly compliments and sets up the one succeeding it. No number 1 singles came out of this album, and once you listen to the full album it becomes clear why: These songs work best when put together. Many cite this as the first concept album ever created. I personally disagree (I think prototype-concept album is the better word), but the songs performed by Billy Shears and the Lonely Hearts Club Band are quite clearly linked: This album has probably the best song order of any album. It's diversity also make it the most accesible of all the Beatles albums as well, an added bonus. The Fab Four (well, except for Paul) didn't understand why this album was received how it was. But the average listener should understand. Not once, in the entire album, do you stop thinking of just how... well, perfect it is. Nothing the Beatles put out afterwards, and really nothing any band or artist ever put out equaled this, and I personally don't think anything ever will (though Brian Wilson's SMiLE did come close). I suppose if it isn't clear already: This is a must have album. If you only have one Beatles album, make it this one.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This work is absolutely excellent! A couple\\"must have\\" for those who love American revolutionary history . I have even given this as a gift . I am on my third viewing ...
B000002JSP|5.0|Few bands can claim to have a GOOD last album. Most of the time they're often the weakest of all the material a group puts out (The Beatles and Cream being the primary examples in my mind). But not Led Zeppelin. True, this technically isn't their very last album, but it was the last one all four members created before Bonzo's tragic demise. Most people DO criticize this album as the weakest Zeppelin put out (except for CODA, but whether that really counts as an album seems debatable). I completely disagree. In fact, I dare say this was one of Zeppelin's stronger releases. It seems to me much more organized than the previous release Presence, and overall in my opinion has a better sound to it. A lot of people complain about the excessive use of synthesizers by Zeppelin on this one, and I will admit at times it is a bit much. However, I think it's pulled off rather well, and it's a nice change for Zeppelin. Many of the tracks do seem experimental(Carouselambra being the main culprit), but it does leave one curious as to what would have happened had Zeppelin fully refined the use of synthesizers. Either way, the tracks on the record are all great. Highlights include In the Evening, the aforementioned synthesizer-fueled Carouselambra and All of My Love. The signature Zeppelin guitar riffs luckily are not totally lost in the stew of synthesizers. Plant sings quite well, not as youthfully as he did in the seven prior releases, but still good enough to carry the album through. Bonzo is amazing as always, and Page does his best with his guitar wizardry, though John Paul Jone's synth riffs do challenge him more than on any other Zeppelin album. Overall, I think this is a much-underrated album. It was Zeppelin's last, and it is arguably their most unique. It's no ZOSO, but it's certainly a worthy purchase, and will certainly stand out among your Zeppelin albums.

There will not be another like him; and this book really highlights all that he was able to share in his short life. If you love fashion, are into fashion, are thinking about getting into fashion, if you brush your teeth... BUY THIS BOOK! You will not be disappointed in the art of Alexander McQueens design. The book is beautifully done and shines a light on him that is well deserved.

0385534639|5.0|The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern proved to be an envious debut novel. I don't really know what so many of the \\"critics\\" were talking about on Goodreads and other review sites; this book wasn't all description without plot. If you read enough reviews yourself, you will find that people either loved or hated the book because of her descriptions, which some readers found too lengthy and distracting. I found her writing to be wonderful. This is a beautiful fantasy love story involving two dueling magicians at a circus I wish to attend! (And that's saying something for me, since I don't approve of circuses because of their use of animals.) Do not miss this series and if you're a writer, have tissues handy, for you will probably be crying with envy!

B004VYYA2K|3.0|It's not really a toy, it serves the purpose of storage which is wat i<br />Bought it got. A little pricey, but looks cute. My daughter who is 5 was thrilled to receive a box. But nonetheless it adds spunk to her room
030758836X|2.0|A mean, even cruel novel...and that's fine. I can handle that. But there're some serious holes in the plot, and the ending is poorly conceived and unsatisfying. The author is hip to current trends, the dialog is generally excellent, but the nefarious schemes of the two grossly unsympathetic main characters stretch credibility. The two rednecks should have gotten their just due. Amy's parents, appropriately grotesque, should have gotten theirs. (The scene in which they take all Amy's money back is devastating.) And Amy should be institutionalized. The critics are over praising this flawed book by a talented author. Two stars...and hopes for a better novel next time.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|i only finished this book because i paid for it.why is everyone talking about it?it is boring and disgusting, i dont mind a bit of sex in books, but this character is sick in the head.

B0052VUNHC|1.0|This book was overpriced at 2.99, stupid plot (if you could call it a plot).  There was no mystery, no excitement, nothing to keep me awake!

B0073U2F2Q|4.0|If you like a good sic-fi movie that has a few not believable moments, you'll love this movie.  It's a complete alien fantasy that moves quickly & keeps the momentum of the characters moving.  I absolutely loved it & couldn't wait to own it.
B007R5IRBA|5.0|CHOICES - This might well change, but right now in CD Format the \\"Special\\" with 4 bonus Tracks is only avialable as \\"Import\\", and priced up as such . All 16 Tracks are also offered as MP3 Download.<br /><br />\\"WE ARE THE OTHERS\\" has already been out over here in UK and Europe  a month before its USA Release -just about long enough to be able to say for sure this  latest Delain work  is proving to be yet a third  VERY replayable album ,with \\"go back to\\" legs every bit as long as of those of both Lucidity and April Rain .<br /><br />Rightly , it does not attempt to be any \\"repeat\\" of either , bur comes out as  a further evolution of style ,the fruit of their now full evolution  from Martijn's original  \\"convalescent \\" studio-project-with- guests ( remarkable enough in itself ) into one of the strongest  self contained live-touring bands now around .Burton C Bell is the one  guest, on \\"Where Is The Blood\\" - the one track with male vocals to duet with Charlotte ( Marco Heitala  also  guests again, but this time only on 2 of the live bonus tracks) . There are maybe less symphonic elements in the mix this time round , partly down I would guess to the practical limits to how far any band can ever tour symphonics \\"live\\" , and without obvious backing loops<br /><br />Warner's takeover of Roadrunner left this album stuck in limbo for several frustrating months, but its proved well worth the wait.Ironically, some of the delay, especially if it be true that Warner \\"just don't get Metal\\", might have been down to Lucidity and April Rain both continuing to sell too near the top of of the Goth/Power/Prog metal listings ( on Amazon UK at least) .... I hear a \\"Suit\\" accountant :\\"keep it on hold!\\"<br /><br />Though Delain come across as way too down to earth to go down any kind of explicitly \\"Concept Album\\" path, both their past works did focus on a theme or three that held them together, and so too does this : Opener \\"Mother Machine\\" sets up a macabre  \\"Metropolis\\"-like backdrop forthe title track , inspired by the notorious  2007 UK murder  of UK  Sophie Lancaster , kicked to death just for being a Goth(it was by the way only through this  band's website that I learned of the Foundation created in her memory ,its aim to  \\"Stamp Out Prejudice, Hatred, Intolerance, Everywhere\\")<br /><br />Other later tracks referencing male-against- female mindless brutality or control-freakery include \\"Hit Me With Your Best Shot\\" , \\" I Want You\\" and \\"Not  Enough\\". In a much lighter vein, \\"Generation Me\\" is as neat a gentle  satire on  Facebook & Twitter etc  as you are likely to hear from anyone, anytime soon!<br /><br />For any who do not know the previous albums, just one or two of the better live gig clips  on Youtube will be worth way  more than  any thousand words from me, not least on Charlotte Wessels' outstanding qualities as lead vocalist and lyricist . This current album comprises:<br /><br />Mother Machine(previous working title was \\"Manson\\"/Electricity/We Are The Others/Milk  and Honey/Hit Me With Your Best Shot/I Want You/Where Is The Blood (with Burton c Bell)/Generation Me/Babylon/Are You Done With Me/Get The Devil Out Of Me /Not Enough<br /><br />\\"Special Edition\\"BonusTracks :Live versions of \\"The Gathering\\"/ \\"Control The Storm\\"/ Shattered\\"/ \\"Sleepwalker's Dream\\".<br /><br />Last, some \\"USER MANUAL\\" Stuff you just MIGHT need:<br /><br />LYRICS These are not printed in full ( at least not in the UK Special Edition) only some sample lines . To download the full lyrics , for this or any Delain album, just go on their  website, select  the \\"Releases\\" tab, click on each track in turn and the words of that song  are all there for you to view or \\"copy & paste\\".<br /><br />MEDIAPLAYER -My extended \\"Special\\" CD at first misread as just \\"Unknown Artist\\" etc etc . Thanks again to A.Day (on Amazon UK)for his tip that fixes this:<br /><br />Right click the album cover picture (or rather where it should be) and click find album info, then type Delain We Arethe Others into the search bar that comes up.<br /><br />The normal edition will come up as the first option for it, select that and it will automatically put the album cover, track titles etc... in for the first 12 tracks<br /><br />Then just manually type the last 4 tracks info in yourself , job done!<br /><br />PS  GREAT BAND LIVE , DEFINITELY NOT TO BE MISSED IF YOU GET THE CHANCE!
0142429112|5.0|I listened to this as an audio book, so my experience may be different than that of others who read the physical book.<br /><br />First of all, the woman who read the book, Jennifer Ikeda, did a WONDERFUL job! I listen to audio books a lot and can get distracted easily when someone is not a good reader. Ikeda was great! Her voices for different characters were easily distinguished during dialogue, she paused between chapters and breaks in the book well. Her voice and pace of reading were easily followed and not at all annoying or distracting. 5/5 stars for Ikeda!<br /><br />I absolutely love this book! I don't know how I passed it over for over a year, but it seemed like every time I looked at the cover it reminded me of the Dangerous Book For Boys(Girls) and every time I read the synopsis it didn't sound interesting. Since I drive a lot, when I saw the audio version at the library I decided to grab it and see what all the hype was about. I'm glad I did!<br /><br />I will not recap the plot line since, if you're reading my review, you probably already know what it's about. To me, this book reminded me of some kind of cross between the Twilight series, and Ken Follett's The Pillars of the Earth and World Without End books. No hear me out. It felt like Twilight for the obvious reasons, vampires falling in love with a forbidden \\"creature\\", love story without sex and upcoming war between creatures who don't approve of their love. But then it also felt like Follett's recent writing because of the multiple characters and subplots going on. This book wasn't quite as deep into subplots as Follett, but still, there were lots of descriptions that some might deem unnecessary (I enjoyed them for the most part, they made the book more believable and real). Also, the next book sounds like it will be a big 16th century book, so the time period feels like Follett.<br /><br />Yes, there are vampires and witches, and yes, the storyline of the love story may feel recycled to those who've read a lot of these kind of books (I read a lot of complaints in other people's reviews) but there is something about this book that is engaging and feels interesting and different. I like that this book is long and drawn out. If you want a quick read, short book, this is not for you. These books are not stand alone books - once you read the first one you will want to read the next two. This one did not end cleanly, it ended making you want to read more!<br /><br />I'm glad I picked up this book late since the next one is coming out soon. If you enjoy listening to audio books or have a long car trip coming up, this one is a great one to listen to! I hope Ikeda is the reader for all three books!'ve read a lot of these kind of books (I read a lot of complaints in other people's reviews) but there is something about this book that is engaging and feels interesting and different.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|With so many great reviews I had started to think that the developer paid a lot of people or had that many supportive friends but I dl'd it myself and WOW! GREAT APP! Giving it a few days to confirm its usefulness but I WILL be purchasing the paid version because they deserve a few bucks for this one! LOVE the % in my notification bar -DROID 4-
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|Simply this - shame on the marketing group for not enticing me to see this in a theater. A wonderful show in all aspects.
1475143389|5.0|Of all the Books I've read over the years about weight training and eating, this is by far the easiest to understand! It breaks one what you need to do to bulk, cut, or just maintain a certain weight for everyone from the beginner weightlifter, to the experienced bodybuilder. An overall great book! Feel free to contact Mike as well. I honestly believe that he is really trying to get people in better shape and not just sell books.
1933952806|5.0|After buying the camera,I knew I needed a book to learn how to use it(sorry,but the included Nikon manual,leaves alot to be desired).Reading all the reviews and comments I bought this one and could not be more than pleased.Not only is the book clear and concise but intertaining as well.Do yourselve and your new toy a favorite and get this one.I brought mine used and did not have the binding issue at all.
B008EQIA7W|3.0|What can I say?  These sequels always have a possible story that suffers to get in the way of the special effects and noise.  Yes, the movie had good acting.  Yes, the movie had good special effects.  And yes, this movie had a top notch cast. Unfortunately, NO, this movie's story did not hold much of an interest as it was overwhelmed by special effects and noise. Although there were many good parts, the movie droned on and on creating a mind numbing effect that surprisingly induced sleep and apathy.  For this movie, less means more.  It passes as a good \\"there's nothing else on\\" movie.<br />Take your girlfriend and tell her to bring her knitting, but don't forget your latest edition of Biker Babes to flip through during the show.
B002ZG976U|5.0|This is a very enjoyable movie. I'm not a great lover of musicals as such but I loved this one. Cher just seems to keep on keeping on.
B0086DBE62|4.0|This movie started somewhat slow and that didn't help with the fact that I had to sit through a chick flick at my girlfriend's request (her choice that night). This chick flick came through quite well.<br />This movie was saved by two things: The first was the acting of Nathan Laine; and, the second was by the return of Audrey Hepburn to the big screen.<br />My girlfriend and I soon found ourselves laughing out loud with the antics of Laine and the seven dwarfs.<br />This is a good date night movie that will give you time to work on your popcorn at the beginning.<br />Watch it, and tell me that the beauty of Audrey Hepburn doesn't return to the big screen.  I dare you!
0307719774|5.0|I got this book as a Christmas gift. I started writing in it around the middle of January, and have been doing so everyday since. I really appreciate the space (although I write more sometimes) and the size (as I take it with me when I travel). I've never been good at keeping a journal, but this has kept me excited and intrigued to see what the next day holds. I'm looking forward to doing this year after year, and I'll be giving these as gifts. I love them!
B00723NWJE|5.0|I've had great respect for Norah Jones since her 2002 debut. I like the quality in her songwriting and production style, relying on strong melodies and a nice flow of songs in order to make a good record. I actually consider her third album Not Too Late to be one of the 10 best albums of the past decade. Even though she gets a lot of praise from the grammys and the public, I feel that it's much deserved. As she once said herself, the appeal of the songs is their simplicity. It may take a few listens to fully appreciate it but it does work very well.<br /><br />Little Broken Hearts is her 2nd collaboration with Danger Mouse after working on one of his records, he produces for her this time around and together, they craft a nice collection of songs that fit together and are quite enjoyable. I will say that this is the most produced that Norah has ever sounded and while her last record, 2009's The Fall, was sort of a sign that she was going for a more atmospheric sound, this time it completly comes together or I guess you can say is fully realised. I enjoyed The Fall very much but I would say this record is even better and her best since Not Too Late. While the weird textures on \\"Happy Pills\\" may put some off at first, it has become a song that I really like.<br /><br />Every song on this record is worth a listen. Songs like \\"Say Goodbye\\", \\"Take It Back\\", \\"4 Broken Hearts\\" and \\"Miriam\\" have become some of my favorite Norah Jones songs. As I said above, this album still has the same charm that Norah brings to her music but includes more production this time around but it's not too much that it distracts you, it's still Norah if you ask me.<br /><br />While it may be an overstatement at this point, what makes Ms. Jones' music work so well is the simplicity in the songs. She's never pretentious with the way she approuches music the way I see it but still provides so much charm to the songs that it's hard (for me at least) not to be drawn into them. Congrats Norah on another nice collection of songs.er nice collection of songs.
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|I enjoyed this until it started having problems with the backdrops on which the objects are placed. After the theater, the office storehouse and the factory both  used the theater backdrop, which looked silly and seriously whacked the atmosphere. Returning to the office storehouse after Reilly's house left *his* backdrop on the scene.<br />I never did see the factory or museum backdrops - the items in the museum were placed on a black background (which left no challenge at all...).<br />Restarts of game and device made no difference.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|great fun challenging and entertaining hours of frustrating and rewarding good times i dont want to type any more you cant make me
B007JM4CWY|4.0|If you like jigsaw puzzles or similar this is a great game.  There are a lot of puzzles so it doesn't get old.

B004T2QZL8|5.0|This is a great game! It can even be addicting and it uses the brain.It was so worth paying for. Before I bought the game I got the free version to make sure it was good.
B005JU5JEI|2.0|If you don't recoil from the idea of a school teacher in charge of your children's education who smokes dope, lies, steals, manipulates those around her, uses movies to babysit her class while she sleeps off a hangover every morning and is totally devoid of any sense of professional responsibility to her students, then maybe you'll find this film funny.<br /><br />The overriding conceit at the heart of `Bad Teacher' is the idea that the audience will somehow look past the reprehensible moral bankruptcy at the core of the central character (played to perfection by Cameron Diaz) and root for her, because she's good looking and has a few memorable one-liners so all can be forgiven. The character Diaz plays so well is dishonest, greedy, lazy, irresponsible, rude, utterly self-serving and in every way despicable. She is educating your kids, folks, and her manipulative, blackmailing ways win out for her in the end. This is funny, OK?<br /><br />The film gets two stars rather than one because, on a purely technical level, it works as a (very improbable) narrative. The storyline is coherent and the editing snappy, the actors give their all, the script does have its moments, it's watchable. But somehow it's hard to get past the overall message the film leaves you with: if you're a selfish, lying, morally bankrupt, pot-smoking, drunken, money-grubbing whore willing to blackmail and deceive all around you whilst having complete contempt for any kind of professional responsibility to your students and their futures, this is in some way admirable. You will win out over more honest and responsible people, and it's hilarious.<br /><br />No, it's not.
0345803485|2.0|For all the hype this series was not at all what I expected it to be, and in a bad way. It is poorly written and the plot is mediocre at best. I have been an avid romance enthusiast for a very long time and when I finished this series I found myself destroyed for romance literature. Almost every line is a rip off of Twilight (another grossly overrated series)and the similarities are disgusting. E.L. James seems to have just swapped out the vampires for bondage. All I can say is that I am now reading classic horror stories. This book drove me from my favorite genre to horror stories... you fill in the blanks. The only reason this book got two stars is because the sex is hot, in more than a thousand pages of print the sex is the only thing going for it.<br /><br />Save your money, this book isn't worth it.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|awesome favorite game for the kindle. was very happy to find a game this interesting. almost felt like I was playing maplenstory
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|My kids and I really like this game. The only issue was that the instructions weren't always clear. The stargazer minigame is difficult to figure out because there were no real instructions. Also it is too easy to miss a piece of mail and you can just simply go back.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game lots of funvl to play. kids love also. I suggest getting. it._) pretty fast paced. love it. _
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the app is good but it takes forever to save points to get new games and some took me forever to even complete
1423140591|5.0|Received my copy of Son of Neptune today.  I collect the series and can't wait for the new one!  Love Amazon!
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|This was a fast-paced story and I enjoyed it very much. It was hard to watch only one episode at a time as I wanted to see what was going to happen next. The quality of the blu-ray was excellent.
B005G5PPGS|3.0|I wish I had Michael Lewis' range as a writer.  If there were metrics for authors, he'd be on the top.  I've only got one book to my credit ([[ASIN:B002VECR6S A Sportcasters Guide to Watching Football]]) and Lewis has over a dozen, ranging from LIAR'S POKER and THE BIG SHORT, about high finance, BLIND SIDE and MONEYBALL, about sports, etc.  He's a superb writer and he digs deep into his subjects.  But the problem with Moneyball is, it was great in theory but it didn't really work in practice.  The Oakland A's had one good year, with three excellent pitchers they lost to free agency.  And then, as some of their young talent got good, they lost them to free agency as well, and remain a subpar team.  As Ron Washington, now doing a bang-up job as manager of the Texas Rangers, said while he was an A's coach, \\"Every time you try to bunt the ball, you got 30 gurus telling you why it ain't gonna work.\\"<br />Baseball can't be reduced simply to numbers and spreadsheets, as the A's tried to do.  But Lewis' deep inside look at the way a front office work is still an engaging and enjoyable way to get a little more inside baseball.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I was looking for a calculator  app that works like the Windows' calculator. I found it with this one. It is even better. I like that it remembers several past calculations, because I'm a nerdy sort of person. I also like that it takes up the whole screen - makes it easy to see.
1594744475|2.0|This is a beautifully photographed and presented book.  However, the \\"recipes\\" rely primarily on unhealthy ingredients such as processed bologna, salami, american cheese slices and white bread.  The \\"formed\\" pieces are made from white rice, colored with natural ingredients in general.  The recipes are repetitive--basically the same ingredients re-worked into cute little characters.  This book was clearly written for the American market (one of the only Asian ingredients used is nori (seaweed)), otherwise it's just a cutesy version of typical American fare.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|Once you read Fifty Shades of Grey it was not even a question to be asked on whether you would buy the next in the series.  The story is still the personal story of two ppl very much in love but battling their own personal demons of self worth to decide if they should be together and if they can be together the way each of them wants.  It grips you in more way than one ;)

B007KOYEOC|5.0|How can two ppl evolve into a new life together while still fighting insecurities .... love is the only answer and it will push them both to the brink.  Can Christian be more open in communicating why he does what he does or will this push Ana away until she fights back for what she wants and what she true loves more in the world.  But who is it that she finally admits she cannot live without and would never see hurt even if it means giving her own life?
B0084RSYEK|4.0|I am not eloquent or as well worded as many.<br />The thoughts and depth of the movie may be the definition of cliche, but it was good.<br />I mean surprisingly, it was good!<br /><br />The movie touched on the comedic side at times, coming across as not hard to navigate. Meaning I saw parts coming.<br />The end was gratifying, the middle pretty good. The beginning was a little slow or rather a little predictable, but not bad.<br /><br />I liked it, which shocks me more than you know.<br /><br />In the end, reading the reviews from other users spoiled a little bit of the movies path, but I recommend this movie. It is about 3.5 to 4 stars, and had a good message.
B005QN3ANK|5.0|For Aqua fans this album is a must.  It is a much more mature sound and theme than their earlier music. While the music is still upbeat (dance) and fun the lyrics are not as quirky as early hits like Barbie Girl. While i was unsure of buying without hearing i trusted reviews i read and they were spot on.  there are only a couple slower tracks on the album but it is very well written.  There are tracks such as If The World Didn't Suck We Would All Fall Off.  By the title it doesn't sound all that great but upon hearing and listening to the lyrics you really see how much Aqua has grown and matured.  It's fun, dancy, edgy, and they have never sounded better.
B007712XAU|5.0|I heard about this series and as I am a fan of British television I thought I would order this.  I am glad I did.  This is a wonderful series.  This is full of intrigue, romance and humor.  Wonderful!<br /><br />Also, this does include the Chirstmas episode.  I can't wait to see if there is a third season.

0679745203|4.0|Twenty-year-old Hana is living in an isolated villa outside Tuscany. It's 1945 and the Germans have retreated, leaving mines and burned-out buildings behind. Hana's nursing a badly burned man she calls the English patient, as his identity is unknown. She's later joined by a man named Caravaggio, an older friend of the family, and Kirpal Singh, a young military engineer who defuses bombs for a living. These four exist without electricity, little running water, and large holes in ceiling and walls, yet none of them seem overly eager to leave. In fact, each character seems almost complacent about their living arrangement, but why?<br /><br />This beautifully written book is about physical, emotional, and psychological isolation due, in large part to war, yet there's more to it than that. Slowly, truths and motives are unraveled, as each character comes to terms with past and present. Interestingly, the future isn't considered much until the end, and this was problematic for me. One key question wasn't answered, (or if it was, it went right over my head) and after investing time to read 302 pages, the ending was a bit of a letdown.
1595828753|5.0|The only thing that I find wrong with this is that I read it too fast and now I have to wait for more. :)

B007VGXS8M|4.0|Easy to learn but to move through each level you have to commit.  A lot of fun if you enjoy the type of concentration required,  that is,  finding the characters,  then playing the same level again to improve your score.  The characters change some hiding places which makes it a little more difficult, buy also more fun.  No directions are given regarding finding the books.  Many are obvious so you quickly get in the habit of searching for them.  There are three on each level.  I was thoroughly satisfied until I had found 79 of 80 books.  I think I found the famously hidden one in Old Japan (behind tree on the right),  but such a small part was visible that I never got it.  That forbids you from opening the last section of the game (after 85 percent of the game) .  So that is the frustrating part.  Still a lot of fun and hard to argue about spending a dollar.

0143119680|2.0|I wonder if I picked up a copy of Twilight fanfiction by mistake because A Discovery of Witches felt like Twilight posing as an adult novel minus the werewolves. Actually, I daresay that Twilight was a better novel--at least you could finish the thing in two days, and the pacing was fine. A Discovery of Witches takes slow pacing to a whole new level (though I have to admit the writing was a lot more refined), and Bella can't hold a flame to Diana's annoying personality (before today, I didn't even think it was possible.) I don't even know how this made New York Times Bestseller lists. But if a forced love story between wimpy, annoying witches and extremely possessive, handsome vampires are your thing, this is your book.<br /><br />Plot:<br />Diana Bishop is one of the last descendants of the powerful Bishop family line of witches. She is a PhD in alchemy, tall, and lived three decades shutting out magic from her life. She falls in love with a mysterious vampire, discovers a mysterious manuscript...and find out there's a group set out to destroy her magic and more importantly, break up her and her beloved, Matthew Clairmont.<br /><br />Pace:<br />Major downfall of the novel. I can't believe I was able to muster enough energy to last through all 580 pages (believe me, I was already counting pages from the 200 page mark.) If I can last through this, I am convinced I can last through anything (bring it on, Tolstoy!) To Harkness' credit, the beginning was interesting: I was intrigued with Diana's world of magic, vampires, witches, and daemons--and then it just slid downhill, boring me to tears about horses...tea...wine, fancy rich stuff I don't care about. Did an editor trim this novel down at all?<br />The story moves at snail pace until the climax (finally, I thought something interesting would happen)...which resolved on the next page. So much for building up tension. If the rest of the novel moved as fast as that climax, I would be done in less than a fifty pages.<br /><br />Point of View:<br />Much of the story is from Diana's point of view, though there are two chapters from Matthew Clairmont. I find Diana's point of view suddenly shifting into a passive third person. I was confused when Diana \\"heard\\" Matthew conferring with his son, Marcus, about keeping a secret from her--and she didn't do anything except telling the reader that it happened. I would have expected all hell to break loose from her.<br /><br />Characters:<br />There are characters galore and I am sure by the time you are at 300 page mark you will have a headache just remembering names.<br />When I only had about sixty pages to go, I thought for sure that no new characters will be introduced--and boy was I wrong.<br /><br />Diana: I am having difficulty understanding why Harkness made her protagonist so unlikable. Despite much of the story being from her point of view, I couldn't relate to her at all. I admire her intelligence, she must've had something special to get herself a PhD and Yale...but I am doubting her rationale.<br />She's a crazy woman. The only thing that matters in her little selfish world is her love life. I feel sorry for her family. They keep calling her to make sure she's safe and she ignores their calls, dismissing her aunts as being paranoid because she can't be bothered to answer her phone. I am surprised her aunts haven't flown out in worry to make sure she isn't dead. She's blessed with such caring family members and yet I am sure she will throw them under the bus in a flash if she had to choose between them and Matthew. At one point she threatens to burn the house down when her aunt questions her. What kind of person threatens to kill the woman that raised her? Diana has no respect for her elders, and someone needs to slap her across the face pronto. People need to stop telling this chick that nothing is her fault and she's perfect.<br />Perhaps it's because of her impressive education that her pride blinds her. She is adamant that sheisn't a \\"damsel-in-distress,\\" but that's exactly what she is. She's also annoying, whiny, rash, wimpy with no patience whatsoever...and maybe too horny. It's such a waste that has so much potential in her genes, and she incessantly claims she \\"can't\\" do anything before even trying. What kind of heroine is this? And why does Matthew have such poor taste in women? In the second half, I couldn't last five-minutes reading without putting the book down to strangle her in my imagination. And she has poor fashion sense. Can she just die already? She spends much of her time being severely injured anyway.<br /><br />Matthew: Diana's love-interest and a voracious, overprotective, 1500 year old vampire. He is supposedly extremely sexy in anything he wears, but I wonder if it's just Diana being blinded. I am not sure how a vampire can be sexy in yoga pants, but whatever. He is also conveniently rich (does he pay taxes?), with personal jets, helicopters, cars, yachts, castles, mansions...I am surprised he won't just buy a tank and kill everyone in his way.<br />Matthew is no better in the family department either. He tells Diana that he would kill his son in an instant if he threatened her. I pity his son, Marcus, who despite his loyalty and friendliness is no competition with some ungrateful, annoying witch.<br />The main problem with Harkness's vampires is that they are too perfect. Classic vampires fear sunlight and sleep like the dead. But these vampires have none of those flaws--they can even survive off animal blood if they wish. So basically they are all beautiful, immortal superhumans.<br /><br />Romance:<br />I am utterly sick of hearing them profess their undying love and how early they fell in love with each other. Apparently they are destined to be together anyway. This romance story goes from passionate to just plain annoying in seconds.<br /><br />Plotlines:<br />The plot went from crystal clear to a confusing hodgepodge of sub-plots. It's a complex plot with every itsy-bity thing squished in somehow, and I hope that it will somehow work out. At first I thought the novel was about uncovering the mysteries of a bewitched manuscript, then it turned into a forbidden love story, then they had to run away from the evil Congregation...and then Diana discovers her powers...and then time travel. I give up.<br />I can't even begin to explain the letter Diana's mom left for her...just how many papers are there anyway?!? And why would you ask to your seven-year old daughter if their \\"shadowed man\\" is with her?<br /><br />Research:<br />Harkness's background as a history professor shows--whether you like it or not. I admire Harkness's knowledge, but at times it gets too much and drags down the plot, making me go from intrigued to exhausted. There are a lot of quotations/poetry from a lot of historical texts. Obviously Matthew and Diana have a much better grasp than I since they are both PhDs. I'm sure Harkness is passionate about history, but the onerous history lessons often alienated the reader instead of supported the plot. The scientific DNA, twins stuff left me with a headache--I gave up trying to comprehend it after the 3rd re-read. At one point I thought Diana was a hermaphrodite (which would have made the story a whole lot more interesting.)<br /><br />Language:<br />Why there aren't translations (footnotes? glossary?) is beyond me. Or was I supposed to Google translate the Latin, French, German, and Occitan?<br /><br />World-building:<br />One of the few redeeming factors I can think of. Excessive and seemingly never-ending descriptions...but still some fascinating concepts and scenes nonetheless. I enjoyed the Bishop house that had a mind of its own and screamed \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" to me. I was half expecting plates and cups to start singing and dancing.<br /><br />If you are a historical fiction and Twilight fan, you will eat this up like candy. And if you hate Twilight, you will want to hurl A Discovery of Witches out thewindow in no time. I originally picked up A Discovery of Witches because I won a Shadow of Night giveaway, and Penguin Viking will be sending me a galley of Shadow of Night (the sequel to A Discovery of Witches.) However, despite the lovely word-building, strong historical research, the book just did not work for me: the main characters felt flat and the pacing was awkward. Deborah Harkness's fascinating world is captivating, but the delivery was just lacking. Admittedly, I whacked the book twice on the floor after I finished out of frustration. I went from being excited to read Shadow of Night to shoving it in the unreachable depths of my bookcase.

B007VTVGAQ|1.0|Im certainly not sure whats going on. As I searched for reviews for `Idler Wheel' I was searching for honest opinions but all I got was praises for her artistic style. This CD is just like \\"extraordinary machine\\" in every way. It receives critical acclaim just like\\"extraordinary machine\\". Its is highly touted like \\"extraordinary machine\\" in reviews. However, \\"professional\\" music critics dont actually have to be fans and certainly aren't the ones spending \\"money\\" to hear it. For all the people who are saying \\"You dont have to buy it either!!\\" Im not talking to you. You who have heard this CD know for a fact that this CD wont sell because if real people were looking for art they'd go to a museum and not buy a \\"Picasso\\" for their bathroom. This review is going to give \\"FANS\\" something honest to rely on. This cd was not made with fans in mind. In \\"REALITY\\" we were searching for was Apple to return with an evolved and modern formula of \\"Tidal\\" or even \\"Pawn\\". Fiona, however, decided to return with an acoustic, unstructured, unconventional, undesirable, non-commercial, uninspired, and a 1960 Broadway sounding assault on the fans who made her a \\"Star\\". To all her past fans of her \\"alternative,blues, pop, semi-jazzy style\\" you will not, and I repeat \\"NOT\\" listen to this more than once. Despite what her critics say this CD will disappoint you. It does take an effort to get through the first time. Any airplay from Radio stations would be charity on Apple for her pass success. Its not geared toward the people that will actually want to spend money on it, but rather seems to be created for the art of unique musical structure. There is nothing wrong with that except the fact that the \\"general population\\" of music lovers are not interested in forming a thesis about whats going on in the head of the artists. They just want to turn up the volume and rock out. In the end, this album inst one that makes you want to turn it up at all. The most disappointing and irritating thing aboutthis new venture is that her voice still sounds better than ever, and its extremely frustrating to know for a fact that the power to create one of the best albums ever created is right there. She just doesn't want to make it. If an artist has the power to blow her fans minds, and she refuses to make it because she doesnt want to conform to their wishes sooner or later they abandon them for artists that are willing to make that sacrifice. If Fiona Apple ever sees this review (which I doubt) \\"Thank you for your musical contribution, but serious fans will allow one bad CD to be released without much backlash, but two in a row is unforgivable. If you want to retain your star you need to get rid of that only acoustic style and boring style. Listen how powerful your music was in \\"Tidal and Pawn\\". Your Music BUMPED with bass and your voice and lyrics packed a punch. Now its really similar to the Brady Bunch.\\".

0312360258|3.0|If someone had gone through and changed the writing style- added more depth to characters, avoided the terrible teen-movie depiction of teens, took out the pop-culture references that really date this book, and had written it in a way that didn't feel condescending to the reader- it may have been good. Instead, we are left with a vapid, moralizing, \\"chosen one,\\" shallow, boy-obsessed, childish, and petty main character (and cast of characters).<br /><br />The idea of a co-existing society that has existed for ages and dominates the arts, the religious aspects, the biology of it, the marks themselves, and the House of Night elements were all promising world-building ideas that could have panned out into a very good book. The writing, however, really missed the mark and left the book in the realm of the mediocre.<br /><br />There were thoughts and details that could have helped to create a unique and interesting novel, but it had too many characterization and writing flaws to ignore. I'm torn between a 2 because of the flaws or a 3 for the good aspects alone.
B005HYNCQ8|5.0|Let me start the review with a radical statement: this box is the perfect \\"beginner's set,\\" that is, we have a good sampling of a unique point of view that is suitable for someone who would like to hear these pieces for the first time. The price is certainly right; the recordings are no embarrassment; but that's not the reason for my recommendation. Instead, ..<br /><br />Far too often I feel beginners are put off from classical music because they are led to believe that there is one right way to play the pieces. Static, like a painting, someone conveys the idea that there is musical perfection and it should be framed and hung on the wall. At least if you start your tour of the masterpieces from Celibidache's interpretations, everything you hear on the radio will prevent your adoption of the belief that there is only one way to play the music.<br /><br />OK, so what do we have here?<br /><br />For some reason, this box is simply labeled Symphonies, and that is not a lie. It consists of live recordings of the major Austrian-German symphonic warhorses into which Celibidache has breathed his own point of view, and thereby new life. The contents are:<br /><br />Beethoven 2-9, with #4 in there twice.<br />Schumann 2-4.<br />All the Brahms, with the Haydn variations thrown in, too.<br />Schubert 9.<br />Haydn 92, 103 and 104.<br />Mozart 40.<br /><br />If you are in a hurry to read another review or shop for something else, let me say that for me the \\"hits\\" are Haydn 103, Brahms 4, Beethoven 6 and 8, and the Schumann. If you know and love these pieces, you should buy the box. If you don't know these symphonies well, start with the ones I list.<br /><br />Since you are still here, I will offer my second radical point of view. As I write this on his 100th birthday, if you Google the conductor's name, you will get to read something about the \\"slow tempo\\" he chooses for many pieces, and if you continue reading you will likely read something about how he felt there was no correct tempo. As I listen, it is not the tempo that I find to be the most distinctive feature, rather it is his command of the orchestra and the restraint that is placed on the often overbearing string sections in most other performances that I have heard, live or in recordings, of these pieces.<br /><br />This restraint is probably what makes the Schumann work so well. Schumann was known for having a problem with orchestration that Gustav Mahler thought could be treated posthumously. Mahler set himself the task of re-scoring the symphonies to lighten and tighten. Celibidache takes the approach of holding down the volume and letting the other instruments have their say. It is really too bad that there is no Schumann 1 in this set; in some ways it is his best symphony.<br /><br />And there is the missing Beethoven 1, as well. That too is a loss, because the Beethoven 1 is certainly one of his most interesting compositions. For what it is worth, the two Beethoven 4s are almost identical, and what discipline it must take to do the same thing twice. The inner movements of 6 are a delight as again, the forest sounds of woodwinds and horns can be heard more clearly than usual. Beethoven's 8 is often overlooked, but Celibidache treats it like the first class citizen of the symphonic world that it in fact is. I am afraid that the 9th is a little lacking, and this time it is the tempo that burns the performance. It simply feels plodding to me.<br /><br />The Brahms 4 brings out the full tragedy of the piece, quite in contrast to the 1981 Kleiber recording that leaves you feeling that perhaps mankind will finally be OK. Celibidache goes completely off the cliff in his understated way. The audience must have been emotionally exhausted; it is truly cathartic. The other Brahms in the set is quite good, and 3 provides an example of how slower tempi do not always translate into a sense of feeling slow the way that I suggest the Beethoven 9 comes across.<br /><br />The Schubert and the Mozart are interesting to hear, and the other two Haydn symphonies are each well played. But 103, of which I have recordings by all the usual suspects -- Adam Fischer, Leonard Bernstein, and Sir Colin Davis -- is tremendous. Each time I have listened to it, it is like hearing the piece for the first time. There is something really special here.<br /><br />It is about $3.25/hour for this music. Order now. Operators are standing by.e Mozart are interesting to hear, and the other two Haydn symphonies are each well played.

B008DR258W|5.0|SUITS Season 1 proved a tremendous success - smart television, intelligent writing and a very exciting cast.  Season 2 is now two episodes into what appears to be a fine follow-up.  The cast remains the same but the shift in dynamics has changed a bit.  Patrick J. Adams as the young Mike and Gabriel Macht as his champion and tutor Harvey are still in top form, but the head of the firm Gina Torres as Jessica is much more present (and is a gorgeous as ever in her designer wardrobe!) and there is a new thorn to deal with as the older once disgraced partner has returned to cause friction.  The ladies are more prominent - Sarah Rafferty as Donna and Meghan Markle - sparkle, and Mike's grandmother (Rebecca Schull) now has a prominent role: she is Mike's warm advisor and reason for towing the line.  Louis Litt as the obnoxious Rick remains the same but seems to have a different direction in the offing.  The show continues to flow with a fine mixture of the city skyline and the high-class interior of the space of the law office serving as background for the acerbic humor and very intelligent repartee - especially between Mike and Harvey. Looks like another solid season.  Grady Harp, June 12

His reggea lite- \\"I'm Yours\\" became the best Jimmy Buffet knock off in years, so it's only natural for him to want to go for that groove again. \\"Love Is a Four Letter Word\\" is just that kind of a record; easy listening for the vegan crowd, a happy but not sappy set of songs and at least one attempt at cloning \\"I'm Yours\\" with the single \\"Living In The Moment.\\" That Jimmy Buffet comparison, the other single, \\"I Won't Give Up.\\"<br /><br />Mraz is - in his own words - \\"easy breezy\\" (\\"Living for The Moment\\") in a way that makes Jack Johnson sound like Ronnie James Dio. He weaves inbetween the happy pop of \\"Frank D Fixer\\" or the weariness of broken hearted pop in \\"In Your Hands\\" without sounding like he's committed to very much. \\"Love Is A Four Letter Word\\" will fill the needs of those who think John Mayer has gotten too cerebral or who were too young to catch Jimmy Buffet on the first go around.

B004H2YIN2|4.0|I'm a 3D enthusiast and purchase most anything released in 3D. This is the earlier \\"Clash of the Titans\\" which worked well for this viewer and 4 stars for this one. Forget great acting, and purchase this for an engaging story, great costumes, spectacular sets and special effects. The cover shows the scorpion attack that appears in the middle of the film and really holds the entire story together. The spectacular special effects ending with the attack of the monstrous Kraken is not a let down at all either! I imagine many viewers oaf the original film from a decade or so back will be a bit let down that the owl is not brought into the fracas. They do pay homage to it at the owl appears briefly and is dismissed as being unimportant. This was a box office hit and did about 30% better than the current Wrath of the Titans which was more or less about the same without an engaging story. If you were to choose this one or the other, this is the better choice. See my review of the Wrath of the Titans to understand the differences. FOUR STARS
B008ARU5UK|4.0|Like a lot of musical acts, I lost touch with Richard Marx somewhere after high school and college.  However, I saw this live performance album on the \\"coming soon\\" list, and I was curious.  This album has a nice sample of his hits performed live.  Most of them have an acoustic bent with string arrangements.  For the most part they all sound like a true representation of the original songs.  One disappointment was the elongated, sing-along version of \\"Satisfied\\".  That was my favorite Richard Marx song in high school, but the opening really didn't resemble the original.  While sing-alongs are fun if you are at the concert, they lose something after the fact.  He gives similar treatment to \\"Right Here Waiting\\".  The other sing-along is \\"Shoulda Known Better\\" although it is not as protracted.  Yet the highlight of the CD is when Hugh Jackman joins Marx for a cover of \\"The Letter\\".  This is the rowdiest song of the collection, and I'm sure it would have been awesome to have been there when it was originally performed.  The album closes with a couple of new songs \\"Over My Head\\" and \\"Wouldn't Let Me Love You\\".  These are nice to have, but they aren't what are going to draw people to this album.  In the end, this is a must have for Richard Marx fans.<br /><br />Download this:  The Letter
B007XF0X6G|3.0|I'm a 3D enthusiast and purchase most anything released in 3D. The earlier Clash of the Titans worked well for me and 4 stars for that one. This one really lacked an engaging story and was panned as dreaded awful by many reviewers. Rightfully so as the story is not really there for most any viewer and for the 12 year old crowd, it should have a decent story. Stilted acting is a turnoff for the critics who panned it.<br /><br />Let's move on to the gorgeous sets and outstanding costumes! This is a VISUAL DELIGHT and the 3D special effects are outstanding as they were in the \\"Clash of the Titans.\\" For this visually oriented viewer a story is not really that important in order to view more than one time. I do know I'll enjoy it over and over and maybe use the fast forward button for the torture scenes in hell! I imagine kids won't like this part much on any viewing and they did dwell TOO MUCH on those scenes.<br /><br />This is a creative endeavor for the film makers and the scenes with the maze, like a (mouse through a maze) were engaging and creative. The big ending with the bad god trying to destroy the world was on par with the destruction of Kraken in the other film. If you have a choice, select the \\"Clash of the Titans 3D\\" as the better film. Box office figures were down about a third on \\"Wrath of the Titans,\\" however were substantial. The next one ( if there is one) has got to be better or they can forget the franchise.<br /><br />This is 2 1/2 stars for me (and less for many viewers).

0446547654|4.0|As a sparks fan I very much enjoyed this book. The reason I love reading Sparks is because they are very light reads. I read them in one day..maybe two. He is not an author I can spread over a few weeks. Those who are saying it was predictable, well that is what I expect when I open one of his books to read. After reading about 3 books by Sparks that is pretty easy to do because you get to know his style and it never changes. Also, MOST of his books do not have \\"fairy tale endings.\\" I loved the plot, characters, ending, just the whole book. However, I go into the book expecting to be into it for the next 8 hours and then its over..I also expect to know the ending before it happens but like I said, to me they are light reads and they are not mysteries..they are mostly stories with romance and we are not in short supply of previous stories containing that subject, right?<br /><br />Do not let bad reviews keep you from reading this book by Sparks.

B000VSAEYI|4.0|My daughter(2.5 yr old) was SO excited when we got this pool. It was still too chilly to play in it so I first brought out the extra little toys (whale, turtle nd the cactus-like ring toss game) and she was thrilled!<br />When we finally set it up we put it at the base of her slide and she had a blast. I really like that it's not super deep so I can hang back in the shade with our newborn baby and she can safely play. A lot of reviews said their product came with holes. I have had no issues with that so far. The slide seems to hold up pretty well and the whole pool seems nice and durable. I do lay a tarp down first so that no rocks will poke through the bottom. So far we've had a great time with this pool and look forward to having even more!

B004QL7K8E|1.0|While the rest of the world plunges into an ever-downward spiraling struggle, fraught with war, famine, murder, rape, alienation, and other ails, Hollywood decided to make this noxiously reprehensible movie embodying absolute idiocy, coupled with a delirious psychotic detachment from reality which happily boasts affectations involving destruction, perverse sex, and partying that brings general hurt to the people, both voluntarily and involuntarily, involved. All this in the name of \\"fun and good times.\\" Just goes to show how many people are living in the same devolving bubble.<br /><br />Let's hope that this bubble of our immoral zeitgeist bursts before it's too late.

159514188X|5.0|Oh. My. Goodness. This was such a great book! Why didn't I read it before now? Shame on me.<br /><br />As you've probably guessed, Hannah killed herself. What you (and the other characters) don't know is why she did it. Until the tapes arrive. The stories that she shared are heartbreaking. Hannah refers to things as \\"the snowball effect\\" and that's exactly what happened. There is no one specific event that caused her to want to take her own life. There were a compilation of many, many things that eventually weighed down on her.<br /><br />The way this story was told was very original. I loved that Clay's thoughts intermingled with Hannah's stories. I really felt sorry for both characters. For Hannah, it was sad that she had to endure so much alone. For Clay, it was sad that he never found the courage to speak up, which might have been enough to save Hannah. As you read the book, you can't help but think about your own life (especially your time in high school). What if that Senior Superlative spoof list you help passed around in math class wasn't a joke to everyone? What if that prank you thought was so innocent destroyed someone's final chance of happiness. What if all those times you thought you should speak up but never found the courage to do so didn't work out in the end?<br /><br />I had so many connections to this book while I read. It was almost like reliving my high school experience with every page. It's hard to believe this was written by a debut author, because the skill and talent are amazing. I really hope to read more from Jay Asher in the future.<br /><br />Thirteen Reasons Why is a beautiful way of making readers think about their actions. Everything has a consequence, whether it's positive or negative, and you realize this through Hannah's story.

B00723NWJE|3.0|It looks like I'm in the minority here, but I just can't seem to get into this one. I've played it 4 or 5 times, but it's just not catching on. The problem is that I love her other albums and would be perfectly happy if she just kept making beautiful and melodic music. This one is seriously dark, especially 'Miriam', a song about a murderous jilted lover, written from the soon-to-be murderer's point of view.<br /><br />I was hoping that Jones wouldn't concentrate too heavily on this album on her tour, but I just read that she sings almost the entire album. I'm actually thinking about selling the tickets.<br /><br />I do however, like her sexy makeover.

0345525558|4.0|This is an interesting, at times difficult read. The author's depiction of Victoria Jones, a challenging character to portray, is what I would call masterful. Victoria is broken and emotionally scarred from her difficult background as a foster child, but she is not cliche or predictable in any way. She is distant, complex, and flawed; this makes her all the more human and believable. As a protagonist, Victoria has nothing to offer the reader, particularly one as demanding as me. She lacks courtesy, social skills, and at times common sense. But something, SOMETHING, keeps me sympathizing with her, rooting for her happiness and fulfillment. That's what I call excellent character development!<br /><br />In this book, the author does a remarkable job weaving in the past with the present. Never have I felt so connected with the main character through flashbacks. I found that I actually wanted to hear more about the story of Victoria's past. I can honestly say I have never encountered a character - in life or in fiction - quite like Victoria. However, I am sure people like her exist. Her fears and struggles felt absolutely real to me.<br /><br />The language of flowers, the novel's theme, intrigued me greatly. It sounds like a romantic concept, but for Victoria, flowers represent so much more than a romantic gesture; they hold the power of communication. Only after learning the language of flowers does she learn how to express feelings through words. I admire Victoria for using her special gift for flowers to make a way for herself, rise above her circumstances. This is overall a touching, thought-provoking novel and I would recommend it.
0811876373|5.0|Awesome book. Very descriptive with instructions and full of great ideas for any occasion.  Definitely recommend for any baker who wants to be creative.
B000I5XOW8|5.0|Excellent movie! From beginning to end the suspense is great. The plot of this movie is very good. Good movie to have it is this format.
B003Y5H5BA|5.0|NOTE: I did NOT watch the original TV series, and was not even born yet. However, I'm not so dumb as to miss references to the original and since I did not watch the show (whether that means it was a good thing or a bad thing), they were still funny to me.<br /><br />It's a great movie, though. Jonah Hill is always funny. Channing Tatum not so much. However, in this movie he really steps up for once and you can see he's a pretty good actor. Newly found respect for the guy. Maybe he's got a limit on his emotions, but it all fits with his character here and it's not his usual performance. After seeing this, I could imagine he would be a pretty good fit in some other comedies down the road.<br /><br />As far as plotline, it shares little with the original. If you watch it, you'll see it's more of a modern sequel to the original rather than a remake, so don't be upset that they're just taking the title from it. Which, essentially they are, but it's not frustrating. The story itself is not too incredible, but it's not what makes the movie. It's the way things happen, how people say things, and the characters who progress this story so well. The one-liners are some of the best I've ever seen, very much like Pineapple Express- a great one-liner movie.<br /><br />Another thing about this movie is it's just not a story with characters, but it's basically a parody of, well, society these days. Specifically high school. Between the cool kids being eco-obsessed, studying, tolerant, yet popular shows how kids these days have changed. It mocks the \\"good-old days\\" when cool kids gave wedgies and laughed at losers. With the two main characters seeing the changes first-hand, you can really understand them and the school they go to. Secondly, it mocks cliches in a big way. I won't spoil things, but it puts jokes on car chases, lack of originality in movies, and especially the angry, black police captain. Again, it's not a cliche in the movie, but rather it knows damn well what it's doing and offers a straight-up parody of it.<br /><br />I hear few complaints about it, especially how someone I know (who thinks he's a professional movie critic, by the way) explain how it's just \\"depending on laughs by sticking in the f word between a sentence.\\" Sure, it has some of that. But not in a distracting manner. In fact, I'd say some of the funniest lines are things you don't even notice the first time, like a line in the background or a reference to something earlier in the movie you may have missed. It's written well, and may take more than one viewing to fully understand.<br /><br />Give it a chance. You'll like it. If you don't have an open mind and are not looking for fun or are angry about how it gives 21 Jump Street a bad name, you won't enjoy it. But put it aside for 2 hours and just enjoy the movie for what it is. It's great.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Like many of the people who read and reviewed this book, I was urged to do so by friends/fellow book club members.  I have a bone to pick with those folks, but that's a story for another day.<br />Truthfully, I can only blame myself; the free Amazon sample should have been enough to warn me off, but I kept hearing the hype in my head:  \\"really good book\\", \\"you should give it a try\\", \\"I think you'd really enjoy it\\", blah, blah, blah.  Well the jury is in and the author, publisher and editor are found guilty of assault with a dull, sloppy weapon.<br />Believe me, I'm not trying to ride on some literary high horse here - I read all the Twilight books, knowing full well I was indulging in a guilty pleasure and there's nothing wrong with that every once in awhile.  Unfortunately, reading FSoG  succeeds in producing all of the guilt and none of the pleasure. I mean it's almost insulting how these people have so blatantly and shamelessly copied the character formulations right out of Twilight. If you're going to copy a formula, why not make a good one?There is no attempt to make this a decent piece on its own and they have pretty much banked on people to flocking to it like lambs to the slaughter.  They basically changed the names of the characters and added some sex scenes (most of which are meh at best, apart from the elevator scene which sent me back to my younger days *sigh*). But there is so much freaking muttering, murmuring, jeezing, eye rolling, lip biting, flushing, blushing, gasping, air hitching and my all time favorite phrase to hate:  \\"oh my...\\"!  Oh my???!  Who talks like that?  I won't even bother with the 1 dimensional characters who not only fail to inspire you to care about them, they make you want to smack some sense into them!  This book is not worth the time or money (this includes the free sample).  I'm 25% through this collection of pages (seems an overkill to call it a book) and 100% annoyed that I even bothered. On a related note, Anne Rice's journey into erotica is pretty darned compelling....I'm just sayin'

B007P6VLRS|4.0|\\"Tonight, Tonight\\" was the first Smashing Pumpkins song that caught my ear. MCIS is a symbol of the 90s to me. It's also the my favorite Smashing Pumpkins album because it is so well executed and has the most beautiful artwork. Then I bought Adore and appreciated it in its own right - \\"For Martha\\" is probably the most powerful SP song. Then I bought Machina, which was OK, until I compiled it with Machina II using a tracklisting I saw at SP.com - then it was awesome.<br /><br />After SP split up, \\"Honestly\\" from Zwan caught my ear on the radio, but the album was bland. Then I discovered Siamese Dream, which was amazing. Then Gish, Pisces Iscariot, and Judas 0 were OK. The Future Embrace had an awesome single, \\"Walking Shade\\", but the rest of the album wasn't as good. Zeitgeist was a good rocker, but Billy's new vocal style kind of ruined the album.<br /><br />The lack of dynamics in Billy's vocals have been the primary problem of why his music sucks since SP split up. The other problem has been the lack of epicness of each song - the concept of many songs in one that characterized SP. Was Oceania going to be different? I wasn't even going to buy the album, after what I've heard from the Zeitgeist and the Teargarden releases. But I needed something for a supersaver discount and decided to try Oceania after all.<br /><br />The songs that first attracted me were in the middle of the album and were filled with keyboard melodies. I don't know if I would consider this an auditory experience or the album that I've been waiting for. It is simply an evolution of what was in Zeitgeist. Oceania is Zeitgeist, with more POP and keyboards, maybe a slight increase in dyanmics from Billy's vocals, and less of Billy's background vocals.<br /><br />I also feel like he's mixed in some interesting elements, but I'm only able to identify a few. \\"Pinwheels\\" has an intro that reminds me of \\"Baba O'Riley\\" by The Who. The creepy drums & keyboard buildup in the middle of \\"Oceania\\" reminds meof Pink Floyd. \\"The Chimera\\" kind of reminds me of a POP Punk song that used to be on the radio.<br /><br />I've listened to this album continuously for over a week to try to understand it and I'm still not sure I do. It may be like someone else mentioned - the music doesn't connect with me. It is better than Zeitgeist, but it doesn't sound like traditional SP. Oceania sounds unique in the SP lineup. The album cover seems to resemble the feeling of the album - cold, distant, 2001: A Space Odyssey.<br /><br />Standouts Songs:<br /><br />Panopticon<br />My Love is Winter<br />Oceania<br /><br />UPDATE 7/21/2012<br /><br />I've updated the review above with more detail, but I didn't change it's idea. The main reason for the update is to say that maybe I've come to accept the album for what it is.<br /><br />I've continued to listen to the album to try to understand it. I've even compared it to MCIS and Zeitgeist, but Oceania continues to have a unique sound. Why? I think that circumstances have forced Billy to leave behind the sound that characterized the Smashing Pumpkins in the 90s. After Zeitgeist's \\"mainstream rock\\" sound was a mixed bag, we arrive at the unique and listenable Oceania.<br /><br />It's a good album by the New Smashing Pumpkins.
B0076NAWWA|4.0|That familiar Amazon parcel has arrived! What will \\"Flying colors\\" sound like...will it be worth it? Many love it, some are sceptical, some slate it. Will there be sufficient guitaring from Steve Morse and will Mike just be a wallflower?<br /><br />I hurridly rip open the packaging, grab the CD from the digipak, place into the player and sit back. Seventy minutes later my initial surprising journey is over and I am smiling. This is good. Really good. Wonderful vibrant, melodic rock with a progressive twist from my favourite musicians - Mike Portnoy, master drummer, music organiser with his long-time keyboardist buddy, Neal Morse, composer extraordinaire, singer and instrumentalist who are joined by the legendary Steve Morse, guitarist from Deep Purple with his long-time bassist buddy, Dave LaRue. And then top notch vocalist, Casey McPherson with his contemporary nuances and appealing falsetto who leads the way on this vocal rock album.<br /><br />It's five days later and all I have listened to is \\"Flying Colors\\". This album is catchy with very strong melodic hooks on every song. The emphasis is on tight song structure and strong vocals with harmonising in every chorus - but hey I hear you asking what happened to the virtuoso musicians? No worries - they're all playing, contributing and adding their craft with many structured instrumental interludes in which to shine.<br /><br />I admit that I am confused when I read some Amazon reviews. Perhaps because this is not cutting-edge rock or outright progressive rock, many seem very critical. Did some expect a new Dream Theater or a more contemporay style like Coldplay? I am unsure and when reading their criticism and I begin to doubt my enthusiasm for this. But then I listen again and get caught up in the melody, drift into another place and that's what music is about.<br /><br />What is encouraging is how carefully crafted this album is - this is not some supergroup sitting down and playing a few covers and jamming their way through. Everything from the graphics to the impeccable production by Peter Collins (Rush, Alice Cooper,Bon Jovi), thoughtful song order and actual compositions show that this is no fly-by-night project. Quite amazing that all up in less than a month together as musicians, this album was produced.<br /><br />The sounds and textures are colourful and varied in the genre of slow and medium rock, with two hard rock tracks bordering on metal that allow Mike to double pedal a tornado.The album ends with a mighty 11 minute progressive rock epic, \\"Infinite Fire\\". This ending showcases the depth of experience and musicality this group has and includes greater use of Neal's wonderful keyboard organ sounds in unison with some of Steve's most blistering guitar work. The use of odd-time signatures, slower emotional sections building to the strongest vocal chorus on the album finally breaks into the multi-layered vocals of \\"Seasons and times\\". This gives me goosebumps each time I listen.<br /><br />For Steve Morse and Dave LaRue fans - there seems to be a real difference of opinion about this album. I accept that many Steve fans may not like the album. I am the opposite. I think that there is more Steve soloing on this album than what he played on two Kansas albums or on the last Deep Purple album, 'Rapture of the deep'. Every song has a beautifully crafted Morse solo that to my ears had more variety and thoughtfulness than what I have heard from Steve in decades. I have never heard Morse sound so like Brian May as what he does on \\"Love is what I'm waiting for\\". Of course Dave and Steve know each other's playing like musical twins so their harmonic convergence and dissonance and timing is impeccable. Great examples where Dave struts his funky bass is on \\"Forever in a daze\\" and the thunderous riff on \\"All falls down\\".<br /><br />\\"Everything changes\\" is an excellent example of the group joining and melting styles. The song starts like a track off Steve Morse's \\"[[ASIN:B004FEDV8U High Tension Wires (Re-release)]]\\", the vocals section are all McPherson's influence and then the bridge where Neal Morse sings is clearly his compositional style and Mike brings some monster drum fills and it ends with more of Steve's influence again. The way I have described this may sound like a patch work which is then a reflection of my ordinary writing skills as this is beautiful track. I write that this is beautiful yet this is one of the lesser tracks on the album. The opening \\"Blue Ocean\\" and \\"Kayla\\" are standouts plus the aggressive \\"Shoulda coulda woulda\\" with its concluding drum fest and \\"Infinite fire\\" best encapsulate this group.<br /><br />So lovers of vintage, well crafted melodic rock - including Queen, Beatles and Yes fans, fans of Steve Morse, Mike Portnoy's \\"Yellow Matter custard\\" , Transatlantic, Kansas, Styx, Kerry Livgren, Neal Morse's solo work, fans of Casey McPherson, give this a try - you may really be pleasantly surprised!V8U High Tension Wires (Re-release)]]\\", the vocals section are all McPherson's influence and then the bridge where Neal Morse sings is clearly his compositional style and Mike brings some monster drum fills and it ends with more of Steve's influence again.

B005LAII0S|4.0|The 411 by Maria:<br /><br />Yesterday I was feeling a little sick from my intestinal nightmare the night before so out of character for me, I took to the couch and watched a few movies with the kids. One of them was Mirror Mirror.<br /><br />I was hopeful that this would be good but wasn't holding out hope. I am usually let down by movies lately. Tainted I guess. It is mostly a time thing and if it turns out not to be good, I get upset by the time I wasted.<br /><br />We start the movie hearing Julia Roberts tell us that this movie is about her, \\"the most beautiful Queen\\". She tells us that this is her story. Julia is perfect as the Queen. She is evil but not in a scary way for children.<br /><br />Watching the cartoon version of this Grimms Fairy Tale by Disney still makes kids nervous. My daughter leaves the room when the witch is on screen and I remember closing my eyes too. This is much more enjoyable and no nightmares is always a plus. The world is scary enough when you are a kid.<br /><br />This movie was enjoyable because:<br /><br />I wasn't embarrassed to watch it with my kids. Completely child friendly.<br /><br />The all star cast including some surprises like Mare Winningham (I was wondering where she has been) the King played by Sean Bean from my newest favorite show Game of Thrones and well, Julia. I love her!<br /><br />It is funny, fast paced, and filled with adventure.<br /><br />While I have read some reviews I believe this movie doesn't try to take itself too seriously. It is a modern take with a twist on a fairy tale. How can you take that seriously. It is merely a movie created for enjoyment and hopefully you have a laugh.<br /><br />Great colors and great effects!<br /><br />I asked the kids what they liked about it:<br /><br />Handsome loved the 7 dwarfs and found them hysterically funny. \\" Those little guys were tough and funny. I liked the crabby guy. He could kick butt!\\"  (Can't say I blame him. I loved them too! So happy to see Marty on screen).<br /><br />Goddess \\"loved all of it\\" When I pressed her, she said, \\"it was good because the Queen was mean and in the end Snow White won the battle for the castle.

0553386794|5.0|Am a major fantasy fan. Give me any fantasy book and I will gulp it down in one sitting. Those who don't know what the fantasy genre is all about, think Lord of the Rings. Or the Wheel of Time series which is pretty good too. But Game of Thrones goes above and beyond that. If you set the Lord of the Rings in today's contemporary setting, you would get a lot more politics, intrigue, murder, ambition, protagonists dying, power-motivated marriages, and more. Even if dragons rule the sky, the dire-wolves walk the land and the undead rise from the earth, men will be men and they will back stab, steal, be honest, change sides, realize their wrongs, be good, be bad, make mistakes, lose loved ones, be traitorous, be loving, honest, and not know what the heck is going on. And this is where GoT shines. The characters are so believable that even the magical elements of the story sounds true.<br /><br />This is book one. Pick it up if you are a fantasy fan. And if you aren't a fantasy fan, you will be
B005LAIGIM|5.0|This is my first review with my daughter. We watched the movie together. We skipped the passionate kissing scenes with a collective \\"Ewwww\\".  As we started to review this movie she brought a whiteboard next to the computer, and she created three groups of words: Happy words, Sad, and Mad. And then we proceeded to write the words that best describe the movie.<br /><br />Happy Words: hysterical, funny, insightful, forgiving, silent<br />Sad: death, silent, unhappy, alone<br />Mad: yelling, furious, angry<br /><br />Then she was done. But need we write any more? I'll just add that Eddie Murphy is back! In full form and insanely funny!!! Oscar worthy actually, because his physical expressions speak volumes in this story.

B006ON41FC|3.0|Overall it is a fun game with a repetative streak. For example, the owl always flies at you in the exact same places. It doesn't get 5 stars mostly because of openfeint and the fact that when it asks you to write a review it doesn't have the option not to rate the game, you either do or it keeps bugging you about it. Overall an ok game
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a great game, very relaxing, and you might fall asleep from the music.... Very smooth play and challenges get progressively harder
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it was a fun and addictive game I enjoyed it a lot and I will play this game for a long time the games are fun and challenging
1936608898|5.0|I have been following a paleo lifestyle for about a year, read other books, researched hours on the internet & attended one of Dallas & Melissa's Whole9 seminars (which was excellent), so I wasn't sure how much new information I would learn from this book.  Boy, was I naive...  This book totally exceeded all of my expectations!<br />Not only do they explain the  whats, whens & whys about food & nutrition, they do so in a way that is engaging, easy to understand, brutally honest & scientific all at once.  They do a great job of explaining how the body works as a whole and why the decision of what we eat plays such an important role in everything that we do.<br />I encourage everyone to read this book & share it with those that you care about.  This lifestyle has had a great impact on my family & I appreciate all of the work that Dallas & Melissa have done in order to put it all together in one place.<br />Happy reading!
B0086700CM|5.0|a huge fun game u need it now get it NOW don't run into the monkey or fall cuz u'll die!
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|this is a fun search and find game with just a few issues.<br /><br />first of all, it might be easier to find the &quot;flute&quot; if it was actually a flute and not a clarinet.<br /><br />second, the dialogue sometimes drags on for a very very very long time. I hats skipping it because I want to follow the story, but cut it down a bit between each level maybe?<br /><br />lastly, the minigames need better instructions, I have to skip the majority of them simply because I have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing.<br /><br />other than that my 5 yr old and I love sitting together and playing this game.
B004T0XYM8|2.0|I have a dvd of this movie but I purchased this Blu ray version expecting better Picture quality . But I'm deeply<br />disappointed by the no better picture quality of this blu ray compared to that of the dvd. If you already have a dvd<br />of this movie, Never, Never buy this.
B006H8BIIM|1.0|I used to enjoy my daily FAOTD look ups, now they are a waste of time. I refuse to even look at these IAP games let alone download them. Amazon, please stop this madness, or those of us with a choice will quit Amazon App store and dedicate our time and money to Google Play store.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Let me start by saying I have a very open mind when it comes to genre's of books,and I admit to liking to read erotica on occasion.<br />This book however is just too much. I stuck with it through 10 chapters,hoping it would develop and have some substance...but it never did.<br />Will be removing this book from my devices and finding something else to read.<br />Luckily I didn't buy the other 2 books. :)
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This game is so much fun and very addicting, takes a little bit to get the hang of it and if you aren't into brain games and puzzles it may not be for you.if you like any kind of puzzle type games this one is great, no glitches and no force closes just great seamless playing.
B0058YPGL6|4.0|The 411 by Maria:<br /><br />OK...here is what you need to know. I NEVER watch TV. There is very little time so while I knew of this show, sitting down to try to catch it never happened. So glad I was able to review this because I am hooked.<br /><br />Why should you watch? First off it is a cast of beautiful people. Like Vampire Diaries which is about, well, obviously vampires. This is about werewolves. It is a nice healthy balance now if I could find time to catch up on Vampire Diaries.<br /><br />They need to merge these two beautiful casts because the fans would go wild.<br /><br />Forget the cover of the DVD! This does not make me want to watch the show at all. I am not exactly sure who thought this was the right cover but I digress. The show is about a teenager named Scott who is quiet, isn't popular and cannot play lacross to save his life. He basically warms the bench until he is bitten by a wolf. A werewolf to be exact. Like most superhero story lines go, it is fun watching him learn his new powers. All new powers have a learning curve and Scott's are no different. If he gets angry or hot for his new \\"female\\" friend and his pulse rinses, watch out! Scott will lose control although he is learning how to pull it back.<br /><br />If this isn't enough to get you to watch how about this?<br /><br />Tyler Hoechlin who plays Derek, a lonely, brooding were not unlike Robert Pattinson's Vampire Edward. I see a resemblance and found it interesting to find out that Tyler turned down a role in Twilight as I believe Emmett.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I absolutely love every game that g5 entertainment releases, I have yet to be dissapointed, although I'm not a huge fan of find the object type games I love that they always incorporate a decent story line, good graphics, and smooth game play with little to no glitches.
B006H8BIIM|1.0|why pay for something that you have already paid for?  This one simply sucks.  I will not support this kind of apps.  amazon should know better.
B006H8BIIM|2.0|I only gave this app a 2 because I didn't download or play it so I don't think its fair to give a 1, that being said I will never download a paid app that requires iap, I don't mind it on free apps but come on really, thats just double dipping, come on devs get with the program either make it free to begin with or stop the iaps its getting real old, I would have downloaded and played this otherwise but I don't like wasting my time and space on something I won't be able to throughly enjoy

B004XJRQUQ|2.0|When a book starts in the first person, it typically tends to suck. This trilogy is no different. The author seems to put herself in the shoes of the main character so I just came out really disliking the author as well. In the first book, the protagonist, Katniss, tends to be good at things for no reason. Her usual talents are exaggerated (like being able to hit a squirrel in the eye with a bow and arrow. Really!? how small is the arrow head!? If you hit a squirrel in the head you basically destroyed the head and there would be no way to really know if you got it in the eye. but I'm just saying..)and she is too much of a too good all around character with few flaws, except for being too mentally slow on the obvious. Its like the author wanted to make up a problem or puzzle of some sort for the protagonist to overcome, but most of the answers were just too obvious to the reader, making Katniss just come out stupid. Also the fact the Katniss doesn't really make any attempt to choose either Peetah (might as well call him Peter) or the other guy, who used to be her best friend. Like a typical girl when it comes to options she is indecisive, and just shrugs her options of being with either one on the selfish idea that whoever she is with is probably the only person who she will ever see again, instead of waiting it out in hope of the best. However she is self righteous so she doesn't have sex with either, she just sleeps with them. I'm sure in real life she would wake up to morning wood. The writing is subpar with few details. I feel like a freshmen in High School wrote the book. For that reason alone I give the book a 2/5. I don't even know why they made it into a movie. Maybe so little girls think they can do anything men can do physically. Part of the whole political correctness on the sexes. In real life no girl could ever shoot down a jet with a bow and arrow, even if it had an explosive tip on it and then come out saying some inspiring words to a conveniently placed camera crew. There are better books out there. (mistborn trilogy)
B0079XPUOW|5.0|I really did not know what I was getting into with this book - the defiance of all genre convention kept me absolutely riveted.<br /><br />No spoilers here. Just click on the little button that lets you check out the first few pages. You'll know if this is the book for you long before you're done with the free sample.<br /><br />If so, buy it ... and buckle up. It gets weirder.

0143123173|4.0|I love the new TV series and started reading the books. The TV show is more politically and factually correct re Native people and culture, but the sometimes cringe-inducing books may be more accurate in reflecting the current, still sad, state of Anglo attitudes towards them.<br /><br />Warning: When I started reading the series, I was following Amazon's purported List of the Longmire Series in Order.  It is incorrect and you, as I did, will feel like you are watching [[ASIN:B004H9UZPK Quantum Leap - The Complete Series - Seasons 1 - 5]]<br /><br />In order to save your head from spinning, I think the correct sequence goes like this:<br />1.

B0086T6XQ2|1.0|Really did not want this.  It came with my season pass.  When you sign up for a season, you should not be charged for something like this.
B005DOKIYG|5.0|This is so simple that it is the best thing for the kindle Fire and small enough to put in your purse or large pocket. Love it and would advise others to get this.
B00846REIS|3.0|I liked this book because I liked Fifty Shades, it's basically the same story, plot, even the characters are just like Fifty Shades, so for me as a fan of the E.L James trilogy, and missing reading the books, this fulfilled it's duties, but all the time I could only think how the author could be just a bit more original it's just deja vu after deja vu of Fifty Shades. I'm giving three stars because I liked it, but I only liked because It's just the same as reading Fifty Shades, although Fifty Shades is wayyyy better.
B0058VW36U|1.0|This app is a waste of money - good thing it's only 99 cents.  It continually tries to unsuccessfully load on Android tablet.  Don't waste your time.
B0083GPDBO|3.0|An ok movie, I went in expecting a horrible shaky cam nightmare but they found a way to make it work. Other then that the story is ok nothing special though. So thanks to some good camera work the movie is ok and not horrible.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This type of book is not for everyone - but I truly enjoyed it.  I agree with many other reviewers that this book lived up to its hype.<br /><br />I found the characters interesting and there were many story lines but not so much as to be confusing.  I wanted to know how each of them would fair throughout the story and I was not disappointed in the endings.<br /><br />I was glad I had this one in hardcopy as opposed to Kindle since it was easier to flip back to see dates noted.<br /><br />If you like magical reads, a bit of mystery and a little romance I think you will enjoy this one.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I've read all the books and I think the movie adaption was very well done. I don't agree with some of the reviews  that say it needed more violence it is for a younger crowd and I think it was very tastefully done . the actors were all really good and the costumes and scenery were well done. I would recommend reading the book first though. I wish I had. I went to the theatre knowing nothing about the movie and thought it was very disturbing . But I understood everything soooo much more after reading the book.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|Sherlock Holms is and always will be a favorite classic of mine and the two with Robert Downing Jr. with Judd Law and Of course Rachel McAdams are the best I have seen. I hope their will be more to come.Thank you.

0345803485|1.0|This book really saddens me because there are so many great authors out there who don't write in REPEATED PHRASES and who use proper grammer and spelling in their works.  This story has no other level than sex, it isn't romance and the fact that it seems women are reading it for romance is sad, this is PAIN, not love.  The writing is bad and the story is worse.  I ended up reading out of curiousity alone and I was thoroughly disinterested by the middle of the 1st book.  I don't care about Ana biting her lip or saying \\"Er\\" or Christian Grey's enormous penis. None of that detracts from the fact that the boy has some SERIOUS issues! I am all for self published authors and more power to them for having the courage to put their work out there but this book is scary in that it has the power to impress upon young girls that what this man does is not only okay but sexy and romantic to do so. Yes S & M activities can be sexy but this takes it to a whole new level!
0425263908|5.0|After reading all the Fifty Shades books, I wanted to find another great book. This book jumped out at me. I couldn't put the book down and read it in a day. I can't wait to read more about Eva and Gideon (October seems so far away).
B0007TKH66|4.0|Many obsessive Star Trek fans (and I've dealt with some, by selling Star Trek toys on Ebay to people who wanted the plastic holders that came in the box, not just the box itself!) hate this show because they forget that there were missions before Kirk. A problem with the first season was that Scott Bakula never seemed to be comfortable in the role of Archer. Also, some of the story lines were interchangeable with other Trek shows, the episode \\"Terra Nova\\" in particular reminded me of the Voyager episode, \\"Friendship One.\\" However, there were very good episodes, like \\"Silent Enemy.\\" The Temporal Cold War actually fits into the Voyager episode \\"Relativity\\" where it is established that in the distant future, the Federation becomes the guardian of the \\"True\\" timeline.
1609611543|2.0|I thought the book explored some interesting theories but was really annoyed by the alarmist tone that didn't seem warranted given the lack of actual studies on the effect of wheat on humans cited in the book.  Unless you have a wheat sensitivity, the research he cited at most seemed to support cutting down on all high glycemic foods.  It also left a lot of questions unanswered, like haven't other grains like rice been just as manipulated by humans over the years and shouldn't they be just as dangerous then?<br /><br />I agree that you can eat well without wheat in your diet but you wouldn't know it from the recipes in this book.  I'll eat almost anything if I think it's good for me but the flaxmeal hot cereal in this book was truly uneadible.  It had a nasty, gummy consistency that no amount of additional coconut milk could fix.  There has got to be a better way.
B00168HARG|5.0|This show ignores all of the Terminator movies after Judgment Day. It does rely heavily on the time travel theme, with one jump to the future and several jumps from the future. However, the show is still interesting, showing Sarah preparing for Judgment Day, and Skynet preparing as well.  It's never said what model Terminator Cameron is, however, from what I've heard, she's a T-808.
B003Y5H54W|1.0|I hadn't realized it was a movie about the occult...werewolves, pagan rituals, blood sacrifices, etc. I hate that stuff and wouldn't have watched it in the first place. Having seen Amanda is several films and loving her acting, I was quite dismayed to see her as such a wooden doll in this movie. No passion...no expressions...no change in tone of voice through the entire movie.<br /><br />Not blaming her for the total failure of the movie, though.  There was so much to blame. The script was awful...deadly dull dialog, boring plot, very little suspense, hard to follow.  There were too many cliches especially the fact that the \\"good guy\\", the Priest, ended up being evil and killing more folks than the werewolf did. I get so tired of people who serve God being portrayed as evil. Boring!<br /><br />I could hardly make it through to the end. The love story had no chemistry or draw at all...couldn't care less which boy she ended up with. By the time I finally found out who the werewolf actually was...I was just glad I could finally turn it off and go to bed. Thank goodness my dreams are vivid and interesting, otherwise, it would have been a total write-off as an evening.
0765316994|4.0|I've been a fan of Scalzi since my wife mentioned the Old Man's War saga, and have read nearly everything he has written.  This is some of his best work, and I enjoy laughing with a book.  Some people are complaining about the three codas, I enjoyed them all.  It all ties in, sort of the story after the story.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about this book.  I read it from start to finish, breaking only to eat and sleep.  There are some books that stay with you for a very long time and this is one of those books.  I love the writing style of the author and the way the chapters alternate back and forth between Lavinia and Belle, the two main characters.  Thank you Kathleen Grissom for entertaining us so with your novel.  I am anxiously awaiting the next one.
B007I2BZIE|3.0|I'm a big fan of Rush.....and this is a decent album.  However....i am REALLY getting annoyed with digital compressed recordings!  Younger folks will not understand my ramblings on this issue.....but if you grew up on analog recordings of your favorite music....you KNOW how much better it sounds. ALL music these days has the same compressed sound!  Go back and listen to your older recordings of Rush and Van Halen....or ANY other band from the analog era.  It sounds SO much more open and dynamic.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is a powerful true story of the hardships endoured by our young troops from the first day of D-Day until the end of WWII! Many of us in this country would more appreciate the freedoms we have because of soldiers like this if we were aware of what it took to win this war. This movie was not the mellowed version that is normally portrayed in Hollywood. Well done!
0061339202|5.0|My takeaway  from reading the book, Flow by Michaly Csikzentmihalyi is that happiness can be achieved by changing consciousness in which you bring order to  tasks that you do (sometimes daily) and can bring enjoyment to your life, hence happiness and it called flow.<br /><br />It sounds simple but it is rather complex.  The book is written by  an intellectual and at times its seem for intellectuals. You have to pay attention otherwise you'd be like me when I had to re-read the paragraph for it to make it sense.<br /><br />The premise is that for you to be happy-you have to overcome challenges and use your skills to do it. Flow and happiness are  by-product of the task. But there is a delicate balance between the complexity of the challenge and the complexity of your skill. It have to be aligned. If one is greater then the other, then you will need to increase and improve your skills or lower the challenge. Only then, will flow exist. The author gives a few examples of this: a tribe in New Zealand moves every seven years as to give the tribe new trails, new enemies, new challenge for the happiness of the group. And he give examples of a culture that every year destroys a monument and re-builds it trying to make it better and more beautiful.<br /><br />To achieve flow , there are clear rules that must be followed: The task must have clear goals and actions needed to overcome the obstacles. Immediate feedback is needed to see what you doing is working or not working. The challenge and the skills must be aligned but it has to stretch the person, it has be hard enough to do but not too hard where he will give up. Once the goal is met, a new goal needs to be set.  Once, flow is established a few things happens, one time is distorted, you derived enjoyment in you life, the reward of life is established, and regardless if you have stress in your life or not, you bounce back and establish flow.<br /><br />One question I had once, How can I apply this in my life? I have goals I have not reached. It begs the question, are the goals too unrealistic and complex or do I lack the skills to achieve and overcome the challenge. I think my conclusion is the latter so I have to find a way to increase and improve my skills.<br /><br />My other takeaway is that the author states many times, that life is inherently hard , filled with stress and for him the admirable trait is one of perseverance, resiliency and of confidence. That becomes the challenge and few individuals are able to do this, he gives examples of veterans wounded in combat who attitude and resiliency are amazing and are able to achieve flow with positive and outstanding results. He says the trick is that one has to believe in themselves. The attitude is of a pilot who knows if he runs into problems , he can safely land the plane.<br /><br />My last takeaway from the book, is that he repeats himself and in one of the reviews, it said it was a bad thing. When, actually for me is a good thing, he talks a lot of psychic energy and how is used. Psychic energy is what you pay attention to every day. It is limited and it has to be used wisely. He talks a lot of external and internal forces and how you cannot control external but you can control internal, the consciousness, the psychic energy, the attention and the positive attitude knowing you can do it regardless what hte external pressures are. He has a few favorite workers describing flow, the surgeon who challenge is obvious and so is his feedback, the operation was either a success or failure, the dancer who is totally absorbed in her performance, where time doesn't exit, the mountain climber who sees every little details in his quest to climb the mountain. The concentration is like breathing, they are not aware of it, an explosion could occur near by and they wouldn't be aware of it. He talks a lot about paradoxes, how you must change consciousness to achieve flow but by doing you lose your self, you become part of what you are doing-by being in control, you lose control and perfection and clarity occurs.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the book, overall my recommendation is positive, However, there a one  thing I wish I would have seen. I am a big fan of summaries and the last chapter didn't make sense to me, he talked about the meaning of life and different models of it. For me , it would have make more sense, to tie it up and give practical example how an average person could use flow, I understand he wrote, a seguel to Flow, maybe he explains in practical manner how to use flow in your life not how dancers, chess players, musicians and surgeons uses flow.<br /><br />I do recommend Flow and you will see how you can use it in your own life.by being in control, you lose control and perfection and clarity occurs.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the book, overall my recommendation is positive, However, there a one  thing I wish I would have seen.

B005DZMP00|4.0|Deadheads can argue when the Dead were at their greatest, general rock lovers can argue if they ever were great (they were).  In '72 I was a \\"grunt\\" stationed in Berlin and traveled to see two of their shows.  They were both fantastic:  the music was tight, and the lyrics were fine because Jerry's voice still had some strength.  The original Live Europe '72 captured a lot of the feel good of those shows, but it had been smoothed over in the studio.  The result was a sort of hybrid creation that had a lot going for it even though the purists didn't like the sheen put on after the fact.  Vol. 2 is pretty much a straight ahead concert tape but cleaned up to eradicate the rough spots. The quality is high, the music is terrific.  If you like the Dead, go for it.  If you don't, listen to the Doobies or whatever.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This is a film I've seen several times and will likely watch over and over again. It's funny and heartwarming without being overly sentimental. The storyline, cast of characters (not to mention the actors) and the setting combine to make this a real gem of a movie. The narrator offers little nuggets of wisdom throughout that contribute to a message that's inspirational and life-affirming.
B007U1FEJE|2.0|I love the Beach Boys and grew up with them, but this alblum is pretty sad if you're hoping for \\"Good Ole\\" Beach Boys tunes. You can forget about those Caifornia sounds that you grew up listening to. I bought the CD without listening to any of the tracks first, thinking, WOW a new Beach Boys CD, this is just awesome! It's not \\"Awsome\\" it's on the virge of \\"Terrible\\". I'm not saying it's bad, but you had better listen to it before you lay out your hard earned cash. My wife and I like cruising around in our sports car while listening to the Beach Boys for hours on end, but this CD won't be in the car for obvious reasons! In my opnion, the Beach Boys we grew up with are gone!

B007CKNX28|4.0|I can't decide if this record is overrated or underrated.  On one hand, the good songs are great.  16 Saltines, Love Interruptions, and the cover of I'm Shakin' are terrific.  On the other hand, the record feels somewhat uneven.  Maybe it's the difference in styles of the tunes.  I'm a bigger fan of White's hard-rocking side - see most White Stripes and Dead Weather - and not as much of his slower, poppier stuff - see some WS and Raconteurs.  If you like that side of JW, you'll love this record.  Because I don't as much, I only like it.
B006H8BIIM|1.0|If this is a paid app, then we should already have the perks of having a paid app without needing to pay more in the game. It really takes the fun out of it.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book was horribly written. It was not well descriptive, and the author needs to invest in a Thesaurus, because her use of the word \\"flush/ed\\" made me want to gouge my eyeballs out. The characters were not described well either. When I read I picture characters in my head by what the author describes. I still have no idea what Ana is supposed to look like. Just so you know, it is NOT S&M that is portrayed in these books, its more like bondage-lite. The sex isn't even steamy.

B005S9EJ14|4.0|I enjoyed this film in spite of the flaws some other reviewers have mentioned. The cast is stellar, and the narration by Judy Dench quite enjoyable. The setting and cinematography are compelling. And the message is uplifting. But, yes, it's also formulaic, unrealistic and predictable. The characters are stereotypical and the performances, especially Dev Patel's, are over-the-top at times. If you take it for what it is, a comedy with some funny one-liners that has some serious and even touching moments, you might actually enjoy this film.<br /><br />All flaws aside, the likely reason this film didn't fare so well at the box office is exactly because it's about old people, which \\"younger\\" audiences do not find \\"relatable\\" (to use an irritating new term often invoked by the under 30 demographic). The film even pokes fun at this, noting that the hotel's success capitalizes on outsourcing to potential elderly clientele from countries like the US that don't like old people. Younger viewers who say they can't relate to the film because it \\"isn't about them\\" are missing the point. One day, provided they live long enough, it will be.<br /><br />Maybe this film should come with a warning label that audiences must have an open mind and a certain level of maturity in order to enjoy this film on its own terms, regardless of whether or not it reflects back the viewer's own lived experience.

0385474547|5.0|It took my almost 10 years to finally read this book. I had it from my secondary school days but never read it because I perceived it to be boring.<br /><br />I just finished the book and I am so disappointed that it took me so long to read it. This is the best introduction to African literature that anyone can have. This book should be a staple within all education systems (whether British or otherwise). It provides an insight into African culture and the clash between this culture and the arrogance of the Europeans/Christians.<br /><br />Another reason I enjoyed the book is that in the first half I thoroughly disliked the protagonist; however, by the end of the book I was completely on his side. Kudos to Mr. Chinua Achebe for being able to string your emotions.<br /><br />P.S: As a person who was raised as a Christian, I am honestly disgusted by the actions of missionaries. I would honestly add this to my list of growing literature I have titled \\"Ignorance is Christian\\"

B005O64VH8|5.0|It has been awhile since I last listend to Secret Garden. I recently discovered that the duo has a new album out at my local library so I decided to check it out.I am glad that I decided to get it. I have been listening to Winter Poem quite a bit. I love the mix of classical with Norwegian and Irish folk music. Their music is very soothing and relaxing to listen to. My favorite track has to be The Dream which features Moya Brennan on vocals. What a beautiful song. Love her vocals, lyrics, and melodies. The rest of the album is just as beautiful. I enjoy listening to the instrumentals as much as the tracks with vocals. I definitely plan on buying my own copy of Winter Poem very soon. Love the album.
B00511PTWM|2.0|My Subaru Legacy Outback sedan has only one socket, and I needed 2 for Bluetooth to FM transmitter and a high capacity usb charger (the BT transmitter does provide power but not enough to feed my phone when it is in GPS mode).<br /><br />I had a straight dual sock adapter before, but it pushed my other plugs too close to my shifter.  Looking for one with an angle to it, I bought the AmazonBasics Dual-Port Swivel.<br /><br />The two ports work great, as does the locking swivel.  But, the plug that goes into my car's socket is just a bit too narrow, and the electrical contacts do not stay in touch with the car socket.  When pressed in firmly, it is fine, but the slightest touch, or a big enough bump in the road will cause it to move just enough to loose contact.<br /><br />I eventually bought a dual port swivel made by Bell, and it fits solid and secure.
B005DN7W4G|2.0|If you think that going to the market and buying canned corn will provide you a gourmet meal an hour later, then this is your film...and, boy, is it loaded with corn as well as sap and anything else that can be heaved into a movie to make it trite and cliche.  Can't quite knock it down to a one star level since those sorts of movies are \\"special\\" in their own right but this one was pressing the boundaries.  The ending scenes that were supposed to be so deep and emotional I kept on picturing as being a part of  \\"Airplane\\" or \\"Blazing Saddles\\" and expected the actors to produce on screen a bottle of syrup in order to enhance the effect of their weeping.
1933865407|5.0|This book shows some of the best illustrations that Bruce Timm has to offer, and I've always been a big fan of his style and his work in the DCAU. I got this in very short order, and I definitely wasn't disappointed.
B005USZML4|5.0|This book follows \\"Theodore Boone:  Kid Lawyer,\\" as second in a series created by John Grisham.  This series (I hope there will be more) may be geared toward young adults, but the character--a young son of two lawyers in a small town who is fascinated by the judges, adored by the court clerks and known by every local law enforcement officer--is delightful in his quest to solve crimes and right social injustices.  These books make for good reading for any age.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Beautiful, relaxing and clever. Everything a casual puzzle game should be, and more. For only a buck, you can't go wrong with this app.
B0086700CM|5.0|good game addictive. If your a new player don't. forget to angle the device from side to side to get your character to move from side to side
B005LAIGNC|2.0|This movie is ok but lacked in many ways as well. It failed to tell a great and true story in a great way, but it did succeed in remaining family friendly. I think that this story needs to be told in a more graphic and realistic manor than what was done in this film. This film had plenty of bad acting and is more deserving of a local TV special, not a hollywood film. That being said it is not terrible, just not all that great.
