B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The DVD version contains lots of extra background material that really enhances the enjoyment of the series.<br />Don't miss out on it
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|This game is the best game ever but one problem, it always crashes in the middle of everything!!!! But besides that it's the best game ever!!! :D
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|I like this game. The bad thing about it is that there is not a glitch where when you die you can exit off and go back on and you haven't died. But that's only on the I phone version. That is why I'm giving this game two stars.
1452113432|5.0|I loved the TV series, it brought back many fond memories of Paris. The book is a delight and the recipes are very simple but the end results are excellent. This is a good solid cookbook filled not with nouvelle cuisine but good honest food recipes.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I throughly enjoyed the multiple changes from two dimensional<br /> to three dimensional - the way the play was staged gave it an<br />otherworldly effect yet set it in reality. Very entertaining yet very<br />intellectual.
1616550414|5.0|There's not much more a Zelda fan could ask for here. Gorgeous concept artwork and a detailed timeline of the games' chronology presented for the first time make this a must-have. My only criticism is that some games are covered more thoroughly than others in terms of how much concept work is presented, but it's hard to complain with the sheer amount of goodies within.
B000002QWD|5.0|My tape wouldn't play any more, so I had to get the CD. What is Christmas without some Bing? It is a fairly good recording for the age.
B009O07NDY|4.0|Comparing to the images I've seen online of the Decca (European) release; this USA WaterTower records release is far superior.  Still not the faux-leather of the deluxe LotR soundtracks; but much more sturdy in hard card book style instead of flimsy card-sleeve wallet.<br /><br />Add to that the WaterTower android/iOS app and you can watch a trailer and a few featurettes on the making of the soundtrack without the bother of storing a DVD of 15mins that I'd probably only watch once anyway.<br /><br />Then, there's the 2CD score, with 8 additional minutes extended to some songs and a further 12 minutes or so in cues that weren't on the standard edition; adding up to approximately 20mins extra, and extended booklet and a better quality packaging experience - this version has it all.  (And a good Amazon.com price and goldbox deal to boot!)
B0098460O4|5.0|I absolutely love this CD! I listen to it over and over. Their voices are phenominal and knowing the story behind them makes it even better.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|It was a little difficult at the beginning but once it got rolling it was hard to put down. A great book.
B002ZG974M|4.0|I have wanted to see this since it was playing in theaters but never got the chance until I bought it. Over all its well done, but I would have liked if it was longer and slightly more in depth.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Same thing this author can tell a story and put you right into it.  you don't want to put this book down.  His characters as usual are so REAL. This story had it all right down to the end with a twist!  He surprised me at the end.  Don't stop writing Nicholas Sparks I love your themes and your characters you mesh them so well and stories like these are entertaining as well as memorable!  Loved this one and would highly recommend it!
0061537969|5.0|Every dog lover should read it! It makes you cry sometimes but otherwise, it does make you laugh every now and then!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I loved this story!  what a great writer Nicholas Sparks!  characters are well drawn like only he can.<br />I think what I liked the best was good verses evil and played so well.  You don't see that so much in books today where you can just know that the good guy is going to win!  personalities are so well drawn and that ALWAYS makes me remember these stories forever! Nicholas Sparks you are my new best author!
B00846REIS|5.0|Oh my goodness....such a good book and a good series....already read the second one and waiting for the third to come out....
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downton Abbey is simply stunning.  From the extraordinary writing to the beautiful costumes...from the well-developed, intertwined storylines to the lush music...from the compelling settings to the razor-edged balance of stoicism and heightened emotion...from the amazingly talented actors and actresses to the believable, empathizable characters-in-context...this &#34;masterpiece&#34; IS a classic.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really love horses and this game has them. What a great match! It's a splendid game<br />Yay Tay Tay Tay
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I have lots of issues with turning off my alarm. This allowed me to have to get up and grab a calculator and solve the math problem
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Until two days ago I had no problems, the game loaded fine. Then suddenly. it stops working. I try and open it and before it gets past the title screens it takes me back to my kindles home screen. I've tried restarting my kindle several times but it didn't help. I really don't want to loose all my progress, but I will uninstall if its not working right in a day or two.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I had been looking for a camera app for Fire HD but then needed an editor real fast. This is both in one! BUT, the editor is huge for a small app in terms of what it can do. Impressive. Now I'm torn about using the easier to use editor in the Kindle,  or the big photoshop editor on the laptop. Obviously whichever is in my lap, but that's the best part! Camera utilizes all the power of the on board hardware, so pics are as good as you can get with that tiny little lens on the Kindle...
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is riveting. Beautifully scripted, cast and acted. If I could have watched each episode back to back I would have. I can't wait to devour season 3.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Read through the book several times, love the Percy Jackson Series.  Probably like this series more then the Harry Potter Books
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|felt a bit like it was sponsored by Alcoholics Anonymous but Denzel was good.  drinking and cocaine is great for flying airplanes but unless you can lie about it later it's bad for life is the moral of the story...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I didn't know of this series until after the movie came out.  But I was looking for something new to read, I was only 1/3 into the 1st book when I bought the 2nd and 3rd, as I knew then I wanted to read those as well.  Great Author
B009POCG5Y|5.0|I loved the movie.  Clint Eastwoods performance was great.  He is a fine actor.  I would recommend this movie.  Very enjoyable.
1419702238|5.0|bought this book for my oldest grandson for Christmas and he loves it.  He has read it multiple times already.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|The book managed to be useful and informative. It had many answers that other guides didn't cover, but I still had many questions.
0141331976|5.0|bought this book for my oldest grandson for Christmas and he loves it.  He has read it multiple times already.
1592407889|3.0|I have always been a fan of Shirley MacLaine's.  More for her books than for her acting. I found this book very sad indeed.  I cannot criticize Sachi for writing it.  But what's the point ? So your mother did not love you the way you wanted ?  Neither did mine.  Your mother wasn't there for you ?  Neither was mine. Sachi you are left with one choice and one choice only...forgive your mother her shortcomings and move on.  The past cannot be changed and undone. Forgive and let it go. Focus on remembering the good things about your mother.  She did the best she could. Mine did the best she could too.  I could tell a story that would make stones weep....but the only important lesson I learned ( and am still learning) is to forgive....which means to \\"forgo\\" or be willing to let go of the hurt and all past mistakes. Sachi love and approve of yourself !<br />Your Mom is an incredible person. This does not excuse her lacks...but it does also not erase all the truly remarkable things she has accomplished. I've met Ms Maclaine on several occassions and she was quite cold and intimidating, other times brilliant and friendly. Shirley may not be a perfect person but I know she is a caring one. I wrote her in 1991 when my partner was dying of AIDS.  Shirley took the time to answer me personally and sent me the most beautiful letter of kindness, hope, and upliftment. Sachi you have every right to be loved. So does your Mom. Your Mom, after all, is only human.[[ASIN:1592407889 Lucky Me: My Life With--and Without--My Mom, Shirley MacLaine]]
B003UESJF6|5.0|Bought this for my 3 year old grandson and 5 year old granddaughter.  They watch it frequently and love it.
1250007208|5.0|Let me preface this review with one small fact - I'm a sucker for fairy tale remakes.  Doesn't matter the shape, size or media.  Cinderella remakes on Disney Channel?  Absolutely!  Every possible version of Beauty and the Beast in written form?  Most definitely.  And this book is no exception.  It is a very loose interpretation, but I like that it keeps a vague connection at least in the main characters and basic plot scenes, like the stepmother and stepsisters, and a ball.  There's not a ton past that, but I don't mind.  This book could also stand on its own without the fairy tale references.  It brings something unique for me and I found myself enjoying the fact that the setting is not the U.S., because so many of the books I read are.<br /><br />As far as the characters, I liked Dr. Erland and Cinder and Iko and Prince Kai (most of the time) and even Queen Levana (but only because I DON'T like her and that's the point of her character).  It's a good thing I have Scarlet right now too, because it is finally time to get some more information!
B001HN6922|5.0|Bought this for my 3 year old grandson and 5 year old granddaughter.  They watch it frequently and love it.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Didn't think that this book was going to do anything for me. Trying to keep an open, I heeded somebody's suggestion and read the book. I was surprised! I read the entire book--in a couple of sittings--and finally understood why I and my husband had so many problems. We are so different, speaking different love languages. Now I understand and have shared it with my husband and we are working pass our differences. Loved the book!
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|I found the story line and characters interesting, but I found the language totally unnecessary and offensive.  It may be how high school students speak today, but it was offensive to me and I finally put the book down because of it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|its so cool I love. it you have lots of cool stuff I love it I say it. is like. my number one game
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I enjoyed the video.Denzel Washington did a nice job although I am not generally a fan I would recommend this to other people.
B00APUYWYA|1.0|Not my speed. I'm not in to girls referencing their 'dick' or drawing attention to private body parts. Might be acceptable these days but I find it offensive. Not only that but after the movie, in talking with my husband, we really couldn't think of one part that was actually all that funny. Waste of two hours for us.
B0012NVGHU|5.0|The music was great.  The story was real and emotional and the acting was believable. For a low budget movie, it surpassed many big budget, big name productions
B00BESM14U|5.0|Unexpected, it drew me in and I did watch it again. It was funny, touching and full of emotion. Well done.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great story because I lived thru this period. fairly accurate in the descriptions and gives pause to think what might have been if the crime could have been stopped! Enjoyed it!!
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Good book.  Will read more Inspector Rebus books on my Kindle.  They have so many good books on Kindle it is hard to choose.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|not as endearing or captivating as his previous book in this series, but still a good read. Looking forward to the next in the series.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Josh Groban has such a beautiful voice and is so talented, enjoying the cd very much!  Hope he continues his successful career.
B00005RDRO|4.0|I have this on Laser Disc.  I wish this would have been available in Blu-Ray.  Excellent cast of favorites.<br /><br />C.W.C.
1451695195|5.0|what a story, so glad Dr. Alexander was alive to tell it!!!!  I'm from Lynchburg and used to work at Lynchburg General so I was happy to read they took good care of him!
B006YC74E8|3.0|Haven't had the opportunity to use it yet.  I expect to look at some of the photos I have taken and hope it will help in the editing.
B005NS5CX4|5.0|I love everything by Lady Antebellum!  Would definitely recommend to any country fans to check this group out.  You'll love it!
6305781427|5.0|This is the second time I have bought this dvd.  I absolutely love it as Yanni is one of my favorite musicians.
B005XOPEOU|3.0|I got this album as a free download.  I'd never listened to Coldplay before, but had always heard the hype about them so I decided to check them out.  Too be honest, it just wasnt my cup of tea. I'll stick with the bands I like better.
B004SUWR2C|2.0|It probably would be a fun game if I could understand how to play it.  I only tried it once but it seemed so confusing that I haven't even tried to play it again.  I love the game &#34;UNO&#34; and thought I would enjoy it on the Kindle and I may attempt it again. However, at this time I am not happy with it.
B009AMANH4|5.0|Great Movie, should win and academy award.  Daniel Day Lewis was magnificent.  I saw this movie in the theater and didn't mind one bit it being 2 1/2 hours.  I had to have it for my collection.  Recommend for all to see.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I missed this episode due to the Superbowl running so late but I'm glad I caught it on Amazon. It was excellent!!!!!
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|I love good movies.  For those who like good movies this is a great one.  I remember this story from the papers and it goes well and explains more and brings more emotion to the story
B0084AZXKK|4.0|I love to read adventure books with piertes and sored fights I haven't read this book before but Im loving it.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|I like action movies and this one didn't disapoint.  Tom Cruise isn't the greatest actor but this movie didn't leave me wanting for more action
B004WGIXX4|3.0|It is a good movie for a girls night.  It didn't take much attention to keep up with what was gonig on.
B00A6PD8RQ|2.0|This movie was good and I and the grand kids enjoyed watching it.  However, I had to knock the picture quality down to unacceptable levels to keep the story going without constantly reloading.  I have a measured download speed of 15 Mbps and a wired connection so from my perspective the problem was at the Amazon end!
B000000OQF|5.0|Loved it when i was a teenager and it still holds true now that i am an adult.  One word SLASH...amazing
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Anyone that watches this series only wants more. If all television was this good, people would read less - God forbid.  It's sad once the season ends.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I walked out of the theater when I went to see casino royale!, waited until Skyfall was available to rent, and am kicking myself! AWESOME return to the Bond I love!
1419705849|4.0|My son love this book, I gave it the rate because he said its good but not finish reading it.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|I got this album for free, when Amazon was having one of their mp3 credit voucher offers and took a chance, not really knowing much about this album. I loved Somebody That I Used to Know, but it wasn't enough for me to buy the album, until I heard the song State of the Art. This consumed me to buy the whole album and listen and interpret every song.<br /><br />The songs are deep, inspirational and target society for our internal problems, but uplifting at the same time. Having a bad day? Listen to this album. Having a good day? Listen to this album, there's something for everybody here--from his alternative sound, to reggae, to hints of 70s disco and even electronic. This album bounces around from various genres, further showing Gotye's extensive range as an artist and a writer. If you didn't like the album, I advise you to give it another go. I did and it's one of my favorite albums of 2012.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This was a really fun game to play and it was very easy to Install<br />I would definitely recommend this game.<br />It will keep you on the edge of your seat!
B0010SEMP0|4.0|Great writer, my new favorite. Should make a movie out of the series,,I would definitely go severe times to see and buy them
B003ODIZL6|3.0|It's better just to use an app for looking up words it's to hard to find in this dictionary book
B008UG0JJI|5.0|The beauty of fusion,and perhaps inherent cause of its disolve was that it required so much education, skill, humility, resolve and  some innate genius. Maybe it was  doomed from the beginning. But suddenly it's back in full force for &#34;you kids&#34; to watch and enjoy. It was always, and is here, awe inspring to see people, in this case a trio, take on such difficult, difficult, almost athletic work and present it flawlessly, on demand.  I refrain from saying they make it look easy.  You watch and you appreciate how much work went into it, wondering &#34;how can they do that?&#34;.  That's all here, like it was back then.  I applaud any musician who came up with Al Dimeola. Anthony Jackson did his time, to be sure. Maybe a little worse for wear here, but you have to appreciate his accomplishments and what he has taken on here.  Simon Phillips was a revelation for me. Man can he play! An elite drummer, the likes of Buddy Rich, Gene Krupa, Carl Palmer, Bill Bruford (insert your favorite here).<br />Only issue with sound quality is Jackson's bass, which sounds muddy in lowest registers, where he spends a lot of time. This may only be the limitations of my sub $200 subwoofer. Hiromi and Phillips are crystal. Get it.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I . Love improving my cooking skills with dinner dash esp when you want to run your own businesses in the future
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|If you're looking for a game to lightly entertain your brain, look no farther..game play can be challenging at times but not so difficult as to discourage continued play..the cost of this game is fair I hope to see more if this type of games in the future
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Felt I learned the actual story of killing OBL.  Told from a Navy Seal/ Special forces view point.  How the job of killing OBL was part of a routine rehearsed over and over and what it took took to be on that team.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|Great family movie! My kids love this movie as well as my fiancee and I do. Its a great movie.
B007R108WA|2.0|The scenery of the movie was really beautiful, but the story of was strange and the last few scenes in particular were a little hard to take.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is a great family movie, we all loved it and had to have it. Would recommend it to anyone.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|It most assuredly should be for every American student so they can learn the precious gift our founding fathers bestowed on us and how evil can still flourish in today's &#34;civilized&#34; world.  Freedom is worth dying for.
B000YDAYCW|4.0|I've wanted these boots for years, and they are everything I hoped for.  They are both comfortable and rugged.  They are also stylish with jeans or khakis.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Everything about this series was great; the writing, the costumes and of course the setting.  I can highly recommend this to everyone who wants to become totally submersed for hours.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really fun, has great graphics, and I love the tasks they give you (they make you feel very \\"involved\\" with your horse's wellness). Great game and I love that I can share it with my younger sister.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Just like playing with real cards.  Graphics very clear on HD screen.  Like the &#34;tap&#34; to send cards to the foundations.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|There is no better acting and atmosphere than Downton Abbey. Nothing compares to it! Season after season it has everything needed to make the ultimate picture.
B0081KTI0E|3.0|Reasonably well-executed but rather 'meh'. The 'big mystery' in the movie isn't. Some interesting, creepy effects but the movie as a whole can be pretty well summed up by 'meh' within the realm of ghost story movies.
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|If you like Glee you will like Pitch Perfect!  I saw the movie twice in the theater and now that I have it on my Kindle Fire I will be watching it all the time!
B005CKPQNE|5.0|One of the best seasons of any show ever. Awesome! Couldn't get much better. Great acting and writing. I bought season five immediately after watching this season.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I know it was really written for children.  I was able to discuss the book with my grandchildren who had already read it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Was drawn immediately into the family and servant drama. I find the hierarchy and traditions  interesting. Always appropriate cliff hangers that keep you begging for more... A must see!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome! I definitely recommend this game for all people who loves zombies and building cool stuff. Go Minecraft!
B00BESIKWM|1.0|I love dark films with good special effects, and I was hopeful that this movie might rise a bit beyond what the first Silent HIll did. However, in my opinion, bad writing and dialogue made it worse.  The man character was hardly believable and there were so many moments in the film where a character would say to another info that you could tell was just to fill the audience in -- very lazy and sloppy writing.  Yes, there were some decent special effects, but no better than first firm and, I dare say, less impressive.  The plot related to the main character and the supposed demon child she came from made little sense.<br />All in all, I was glad I just rented this film and hadn't spent even more at the theater.  IF you like the first Silent Hill film and don't mind mild disappointment here, then you might want to check this out. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.
B005FITIDC|5.0|This movie was great. It will make U cry. And of course Mr Butler was wonderful. This man can do any kind of acting.
B008XG1X18|1.0|not my interest. too many sign  up needs.  just like this rating system. a certain number of words required etc etc
B0038P59A0|3.0|I like both actors. But I could not understand Robert when he was talking. The English acccent was a little to much. The movie was ok.
B000V699E6|5.0|I love this CD!  I bought it because I can relate to everysong on this album.  If you are a fan of Meatloaf than I highly recommend it.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I love every second of it. Including the surprise firing of Donna. This shows does not stop to be amazing. Just when you think: &#34;How will they beat this?&#34; they come up with someone more interesting.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Just got this app and I'm already addicted to it! Very fun and the graphics are great! I highly recommend this app!
B000I9U9A4|5.0|Its was excellent. We thoroughly enjoyed it and watch it again and again. I hope they make another next episode soon...
B001K3ENEA|4.0|Just grabbed these and thought I'd chime in. First of all the sound is great! the comfort is amazing and you don't have to worry about the fit. They fit perfect every time, no adjusting. I bought these because my dog broke my old ones. I will use them for both listening and monitoring with my laptop and midi controller with Mixcraft 6. So far very happy with these. I have to say I got mine at Guitar Center as well on Presidents Day Sale for $20 bucks! I got the 2 year pro coverage. All together, under $24 bucks for piece of mind for the next 2 years that I have a new pair if they break for any reason.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love Downton Abbey in general but really enjoyed Season 2.  I am very happy that Amazon Prime offers it.

B007REV4YI|5.0|Spoiler Alert:  You may wish to  postpone reading this review until after you have seen this movie!<br /><br />This is a defining moment for Bond and the crucible of all 007 films. At one level, while strictly speaking, not a meta film, it clearly questions the effectiveness of 007 against today's sophisticated computer hackers and terrorists . At another level, it asks its viewers, in a not-so subtle way, if the 007 franchise still has a future.<br /><br />This movie redefines Bond and MI6, and in the process, it presents a Bond who is tired, unshaven,  who drinks by himself, who runs out of bullets and who fails to get the bad guy. It also presents a Bond who throws away his PPK when we runs out of bullets ( this cliche is usually reserved for the bad guys in the bad movies).  Bond has hit rock bottom and fails the MI6's physical and psychological tests before he can be reassigned to the field (M assigned him anyway).<br /><br />Bond's metamorphosis started with a bang in Casino Royale and a thud was heard in Quantum of Solace.  The suave, debonair, charming and ultimate womanizer is put on hold. In addition, the gadgets, humor and dream cars are, at least temporarily, a thing of the past.<br /><br />In the opening scene the mission to retrieve a \\"list\\" with information compromising British agents is botched. M orders agent Eve to take a shot at the bad guy. She misses and hits Bond.  Bonds disappears to an island where he heals his wound, sleeps with a girl, does not shave, drinks heavily, sometimes with a scorpion on his hand. This scene, does not advance the story, but it sets the mood, and  therefore is necessary. This is rock bottom. Bond, M and MI6 have failed.<br /><br />This time Bond's arch enemy is Raoul Silva, née Tiago Rodriguez ( Javier Bardem).  Silva is an ex-MI6 agent who was betrayed by M in exchange for English prisoners(?) held by the Chinese. Mr. Silva wants revenge by blowing up MI6 and  killing M. That translates as going to war with Bond.Silva's character is brilliantly portrayed, and so far, unique. He works alone--although he seems to have some sort of network-- and has the knowledge and the resources (after all, he used to be one of them) to hack into MI6's computers and eventually blows up MI6 headquarters with apparent ease.  Mr. Silva is out for revenge and everyone is vulnerable.<br /><br />Gone are the considerable wealth, private armies, missiles, underwater cities, private islands and limitless technological resources of Bond's former arch enemies. Silva is ugly inside and out. When is captured briefly by MI6, he removes his dentures: his face was deformed by hydrogen cyanide when he tried to commit suicide..  Silva is a very effective villain and presents a really challenge, even to Bond's male role.  In a scene while Bond is immobilized, Mr. Silva explores and caresses B's chest. The ultimate heterosexual man is the victim in a gay scene. And to add insult to injury,  Silva's seduction of Bond is topped of with an offer to come to the dark side!<br /><br />The incomparable M (Judi Dench) is on her way out--she has messed up several times.  Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes) suggests she retires with dignity and he is to replace her, but not before Bond and M regroup for the last time to eliminate the demented Silva. The scene when they decide to go after Silva takes us to memory lane with Bond driving M in his Austen Martin. It was fun to see M, under attack by Silva AND Parliament to bring the much needed comic relief.  M dares Bond to eject her from the AM's passenger's seat.<br /><br />In a key scene, we see Clair Dower, MP (Helen McRoy) grilling M about the effectiveness of MI6. And just when M starts making a strong case for the agency's reason for being( without the MP's anger, but with great dignity), Mr. Silva crashes the hearing and makes an attempt on her life. Yes, this film is driven by a personal grudge, but it is clear that MI6 is still needed to protect the citizens of a freesociety.<br /><br />In another key scene, reminiscent of the older 007 films, Bond visits an upscale casino in Macao. There he meets the beautiful & mysterious Severine ( Berenice Malohe). We find out that she was part of the sex trade, Bond, who is about to be killed by her(?) bodyguards gets into a fight and ends in a komodo dragon pit. Again, he is working with another field agent. Eve (Naomi Harris) who saves his life. In older Bond films, Severine would have been at least one of the Bond girls.  Yes, he spends the night with her and soon Silva will kill her.<br /><br />Bond fans will be disappointed in Ben Wishaw's second outing as Q (Quartermaster). In past films.  Q's straight face( and envy?) was the perfect foil for Bond's jeu d'esprit. Here Q comes across as nothing more than a boring computer nerd with unruly hair. Gone is the dynamic banter we came to expect over the years between these two. But in this new spy business, it is after all, according to Bond, \\"a young man's game\\".<br /><br />In the final battle with Silva, Bond and M under siege. They are sitting ducks outgunned, and outnumbered.  In the process, Bond's ancestral home in Scotland ( Skyfall) and his Aston Martin are destroyed.  M dies as the result of her wound, and Bond kills Mr. Silva, unceremoniously, in the estate's chapel.<br /><br /> In conclusion, This film is back to the quality of Casino Royale, Daniel Graig's, first outing as Bond and it is highly recommended. The one between these two, Quantum of Solace, was a waste of time. In this film we find that Bond is from Scotland, that he was an orphan and that his mother was French(?). Bond is portrayed more human, some one who makes mistakes and who drinks heavily.<br /><br />Out of the ashes a new Bond and new MI6 begin to take shape, his resurrection.  In the last scene, we are properly introduced to the Eve, who turns out to be the new Moneypenny: not everyone is made for field work and she is reassigned to office work.<br /><br />What's not cool: Broccoli & friends' comments do not add anything revealing or entertaining to the film. (optional).  What is: Bond is the last of the two rats standing.  Bond will be back.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love the book so um......  you should buy it  I need more words so read the book and like it
B004SUDPXW|5.0|I picked these up on black Friday ($35 for all four seasons on blu ray).  Such a steal.  I sat down as soon as they came and watched them all.  It's a great show.
B007ED9FIY|4.0|the story was pretty good but the scenery was great ... this was my first movie download to my ipad on amazon and I did not have any issues, and it was cheaper than doing it with iTunes, so I can't complain much

B008L40Q7E|3.0|So, it wasn't as great as the other novels. It felt like it dragged on a bit and took me longer to finish.

B0085TKAW6|4.0|Absorbing read. Nice blend of history and fiction. When will third volume be published? The organising theme? The Cold War?
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I got the game on my kindle today and I was addicted to it the controls are great just like the full version please make a unlimeted version
B009GIPDQS|4.0|For the genre, it developed as a very fast read. Enough mystery and plausibility. Unlikely ends tied together well enough. Expect an entertaining read - nothing to think about, which is good if this is the reason for the selection. Entertaining.
B00BETX5PS|2.0|What a disappointment.  I assumed that given the cast there would be a good movie.  I was wrong.  This is a waste of two and a half hours.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|In this game you can have your own virtual horse to play with. You can have horses, zebras, and unicorns! Being a horse rider, I love to be able to groom my horse and ride it without working and falling off.
B00B10ENBA|5.0|Great movie.  My favorite of the Oscar picks.  I think Afflect should get director and actor.  But I bet he gets nothing.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|With this game you don't have to be an artist to play. You can play with Facebook friends, family, or other players.<br />I love the game  because I love to draw. You get to have your whole screen as your canvas.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in years.  I generally don't like fantasy.  I wanted this to go on forever.  I don't know if it is really considered a book of fantasy.  I am not good at genres.  (I don't even know how to spell it).  There is another world going on.  She makes it so real, I wanted to go there.  I loved her characters.  I think she does an amazing job of developing personalities and magical scenes.
B009OYSFDM|3.0|Interesting cast and plot, along with some action packed scenes. Why didn't they just call it The Green Arrow ?
B00B0ZT9NI|1.0|We all know right away they are going to make it out.  Everything else that happens is hollow suspense because you know it has to resolve along the way:<br /><br />The operation sounds absurd and they say no but then they end up saying yes!<br />Theyre pulling the plug on the operation but Mr Argo says the operation is still a go!<br />They arent getting the papers to the people in time but Walter White makes sure they do!<br />The Iranian maid knows who they really are but it turns out shes on their side!<br />The leader of the prisoners says he doesnt want to take the risk but then decides to take the risk!<br />the producers are away from the phone and omg they come back to the phone just in time!<br />The Iranian guards look like they're going to turn them back but they end up letting them through!<br /><br />Come on...all these pointless culdesacs dont add up to a 5 star oscar worthy picture.<br /><br />the only points it deserves are for the cool 70s outfits and hair.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|Its not as cool as minecraft but its ok. I like burning the llittle animals. I don't like the 15 mins.
037582913X|5.0|We brought children's books instead of greeting cards to my sister's baby shower.  I loved this book as child and hope that my nephew does as well.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|This book is a real page turner....Lee Child is an amazing author.  This book will not disappoint you.  As usual, just when you think you have the plot figured out, it takes a strange fork in the road.  I have read every Jack Reacher book.  Leaves me impatiently waiting for more.
B000077VR3|5.0|This movie/ musical may possibly be one of the most romantic stories of all time. The music and dancing are also fantastic.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Great character development. Intriguing story lines. Found this show by accident and it has become one of my favorites. Would recommend to anyone.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I really enjoyed how the book was written. It goes from past to present giving you a real sense of Victoria. I found myself rooting for her and occasionally yelling at her not to self destruct. It is a book I will read again and again.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|The concept of love languages makes so much sense, and can apply to all of your relationships. I recommend it whether you're married, divorced, going to get married, etc. Very thought provoking!
1419705849|5.0|Great buy fantastic price and my son loves Diary of a Wimpy Kid series of books.  Thank you for such a great purchase.
B001QFZADA|5.0|Having read the 5 love languages that was more geared to married folks, and having recently divorced, I wanted to see how this idea applied to singles. Very informative! Usefull for every relationship in your life!
B0098VXE50|4.0|This movie has so many things going for it.  Do yourself a favor and watch the entire movie before you judge.  Charlize Teron opens up a serious can of whoop ass on Snow White before by fairest blood, the queen is undone.  Some of the best acting is this movie is done by the actors under 5 feet tall.  The costumes are beautiful, the sets are wonderful and the locations were stunning.  The special effects where imaginative and do not fail to work on the small screen.  That being said, If you can ignore the Huntsman you will enjoy this movie.<br /><br />The only thing worse than Hensworth's performance as \\"Thor\\" Is the hammer like manner in which he wields this HORRID accent.  The \\"Huntsman's\\" accent comes and goes throughout the entire film.  Hensworth makes it almost impossible to get through the first half of this otherwise wonderful feature.  His accent is as though he showed up drunk for the entire production.  It is just awful and will take determination to get past.  Hensworth proves you don't need skill just Hollywood looks to get paid.<br /><br />It is too bad though, without Hensworth this had epic written all over it.  All in all, I still like this film and will purchase it.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|This is a great game to play while waiting in line or when riding the commuter bus or rail to and from work.
0783225482|5.0|Great movie. Very funny movie without having to use cuss words. Bruce Willis has hair in this one. lol. Believe the whole family will enjoy.
B00A6D5GBE|3.0|The game is easy to play.  Some of the puzzles are tricky to master.  The long-term gameplay just isn't there for me.  I tried it to see what it was about.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Watched the entire season in two days. Story lines kept me going and crushed me when they didn't go as I wanted.
B005HS00NW|5.0|Overall it's great-- fantastic. There are a few songs that give me major goosebumps. However, I find I have to be in just the right mood to listen to it. It's not really something I can just listen to all the time.
B005I4JG80|5.0|I was browsing kindle books and came across this by accident, and I'm so glad I downloaded it. I absolutely loved this book and the author's style of writing. There are going to be many controversial opinions on \\"right\\" and \\"wrong\\" ways of doing things. I realized that I myself mimicked many of the principles in the book with my own child as a baby, and even in certain ways now that she's almost 5. As for the feedings on schedule, I learned similarly to do this when my daughter was a preemie in the NICU, a scheduled feeding of every 3-4 hours. The routine made my daughter happy and content until she was able to sleep through the night. A lot of the ideas in this book are just good judgement and common sense too. Some are great ideas I'd never thought of before.<br /><br />I realize that you need to read this with an objective mind, there are going to be many cultural, inherent differences in the French way, just as there is in every other country. You just need to take what you will from the author's experiences and viewpoints and apply what works for you. It's very enlightening if anything, if you enjoy learning about other cultures and ways of doing things.  As a lover of food, I especially enjoyed the section discussing the \\"gastronomical\\" experience and ways to engage young children in taste and texture enjoyment. Not only is this a great book for tips and ideas on raising your little one, it's a wonderful insight to the way things are done in other parts of the world. Again, you only take what you need from the ideas and views presented and go from there. You may not agree with all of the principles, but it is what works for other people & is a refreshing change from the norm of everyday parenting magazines and books. I really wish there were more books out there like this!
B007DIQC90|5.0|The title says it all. It's just a really-really solid album, I absolutely love it-- every song. It's not too often that one loves every song on an album.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|A great vibrant change of pace for Diana.  There are wonderful variations of style, intrumentation and songs that I would like to be repeated.
B00005JKHP|4.0|While not my favorite Star Trek movie, this first one was well done with great details and sci-fi!  This is a must see before you watch any of the later movies.
B008LY9AWG|4.0|Never knew he wrote short stories, but like his sense of irony.  The second story Mulholland Drive, was especially ironic.
B005GRF2UK|4.0|William Hurt does an excllent job in this movie and the movie follows most of the aspects of the book.  Excellent!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Loved the story!!!  Could not put this book down!!  The plot was enthralling.  I can't wait for the next one.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Awesome show love every week hope they never cancel it. If they do cancel they need some kind of spin off of the show.
0307719774|5.0|This book is smaller than it looks online, but is high quality.  There are pages for each day of the year with a simple question to answer.  There are 5 sections on each page.  You fill in the year, then have 3-4 lines to write.  The lines are very close together, so if you have large handwriting, you might find this difficult to fill out.  The book also does not open flat, making it a little hard to write in.  Some questions only need a single word answer, others take up the entire section.  You write however much you feel like (or can fit in the space).  Some questions are a little open (&#34;what is your biggest obstacle?&#34;  To what, I wondered...) I enjoy the variety of questions and look forward to reading my answers in the following years.  It will be interesting to see how the answers change.
B002O3Z50G|5.0|My grandkids had a VCR of Twister and loved it so when it finally wore out I decided to order the DVD and I really like it too<br />it is full of action and has a good story

B0070Y46UY|5.0|I saw this book in the store almost 10 years ago and thought &#34;okay, a man in a boat with a tiger...sounds...uh...fascinating.&#34; &#60;sarcasm&#62;  I never thought to read it until I saw there was a movie--and I thought I might take a second look (I'd rather read the book than watch the movie...so that's what I opted to do.) I have to say, I wish I had've read this book 10 years ago!  I mean, it is so beautifully written. I was sucked in from the very first chapter and could not put this book down until the very end.  A wonderful story, captured in such an eloquent and graceful way.  &#34;Inspirational&#34; would be an understatement. It is an instant favorite of mine and something that I have, since reading it, encouraged everyone I know to read as well.  A MUST READ!  The only bad thing I have to say about this book is that it unfortunately had to end. And I mean that. I was genuinely sad when I got to the last page.<br /><br />As for the movie, I think I'll skip it...as the book is so beautiful, its the last impression I'd like to have of dear &#34;Pi&#34;. :-)
B008JGSM6G|4.0|My wife asked me to let her download this on my Kindle Fire. I did. She really gets into it!
B004X4R3FE|3.0|Worth a rent - colin Firth did an excellent job in the movie. I was expecting more but it was okay.
B0014JKJK2|5.0|I bought these for two features...no holes in the toe area and an anti-slip sole.  I wear them at some point every day and am very happy with them.  I have yet to try them when walking on ice, but the standard Crocs are a hazard on wet or icy surfaces.
0517548232|5.0|Why are things so expensive? Understand effects of the government's role in setting fiscal policy on your daily life. Wanton printing of fiat currency leads to hyperinflation. See: Weimar Republic (1920's Germany); Zimbabwe. Note to readers: It's going to get much, much worse here! Read this book to see how the Fed is poised to wreak havoc with the economy and social order and to learn how to take steps to protect yourself.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|Different at first, but underneath all the new stuff is plain old classic Tegan and Sara. Worth every single penny.
B003TTH4IU|5.0|Love the program and the streaming works great;<br />Grey's Anatomy is a great show and I am looking forward to the rest of the seasons.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|My son purchased this App for me and I'm still learning to use the Kindle with my limited time to do so. I would say it works ok but I'm disappointed in the Kindle Fire HD, to date. Hopefully, as I use it, my impression will change.

0525958002|5.0|IN THE PLEASURE GROOVE, LOVE, DEATH AND DURAN DURAN- John Taylor -<br /><br />Review Diana Mistera<br /><br />The Duran Duran were the symbol of my youth so as soon as I discovered that John Taylor had written his autobiography I really wanted to read it.<br />Why John Taylor's book not Andy Taylor's.  Well simply because there was a poster of John on my bedroom wall along with one of Marian Gold of the \\"Alphaville\\".  I even went to the local hairdresser with a picture of John and asked for my hair to be done like his.  I also looked at all the local fairs for black rubber bracelets like the ones he wore.  He was my favourite Duran Duran.<br /><br />Along with my Alphaville records the Duran Durans were the ones I listened to most, first on my father's 70s  record player then on my own modern stereo in my bedroom.  I remember being the first in the Tuscan village where I grew up to wear the Duran Duran T shirt, the first to wear chiffon, the first to collect anything to do with the handsome John.  Why was I such a pioneer at that time, well because my mother is English and I spent a lot of time with my grandparents in Dorset and my aunts in London.  It was in England that I bought all the records up to Duran Durans \\"Arena\\".  I then transferred them on to tapes for my \\"walkman\\", another 80's icon!<br /><br />But let's talk about the book. What did I enjoy most about it.  I think first of all  the description of his teenage years when he discovered an interest in music.  Sundays at home with the family listening to old records or listening to pirate radio in his bedroom.  The family car, a Ford,my grandfather had a brown Ford. The description of his family home.  These things all reminded me of my English grandparents.  Reading on, things become more intriguing as he was a fan of lots of artists and imitated their \\"look\\" He spent time  looking for new material in the record shops.  I did that too.  I discovered the boy behind the star with all his defects and fears.  The rise and fall, the re-birth.  I admit I did shed a little tear reading about that!  We always saw the public persona smiling in the videos and on the posters but we had no idea what was going on behind all that.  We didn't know about the boy, the constrictions that go with fame, the superficiality, the egocentricity when you have everything you ever wanted but have lost any connection with reality.  I was surprised at his tenacity visible to this day on stage.  He loves to make music. He loves what he does.  Todays stars lack professionality and sometimes even talent.  His weaknesses are talked about in the book.  The time in rehab, the devils behind the public face.<br /><br />There were some brilliant photos in practically every chapter.  There was even a bit dedicated to their visit to Italy, though I was still young when they came, I remember seeing the concert on RAI 2.<br /><br />I had trouble putting this book down once I started to read it and savoured every word.  I don't agree with the critics who say that the second part of the book seems written in haste.  I think where he wanted to make a point he did so in depth and well.  Now that I have finished this \\"immersion\\" into \\"80s\\" pop  culture I feel I now have an insight into what it was really like to be so famous.<br /><br />I would thoroughly recommend IN THE PLEASURE GROOVE: LOVE, DEATH AND DURAN DURAN to all who lived this era either through their parents or who were themselves \\"Duranians\\" but not quite old enough to go to the gigs at the time that \\"Wild Boys\\" became the anthem of the \\"Paninari\\" We opened the doors to future generations of pop fans and I am so pleased to have lived the 80s to the full.  The hysteria, the tears when Simon broke his foot but came to San Remo with the Duran Duran anyway.  I remember Pippo Baudo was the presenter at the time.  It was great and in this book we have John Taylor's version of what it was like to be an 80s icon a real insight into life as a pop star.The rise and fall, the re-birth.

B000W1PXTU|1.0|Seriously? You're given a music review on Amazon? Obviously that is not what everyone is looking for. Some people already have listened to the songs and now want to buy them.<br />For those who people who have I would not recommend buying them here. They just don't sound the same as they do even on other MP3s that I've heard and personally I liked the way it sounded in that addition better.<br />The music just sounded to clean and tame in comparison and that is not a complement for rock and roll.
B0012GMWCU|5.0|The tracklisting says all, his songs was covered by The Doors, Rod Stewart, Led Zeppelin, Cream, Rolling Stones, Megadeth... Willie Dixon is the master of blues
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is one of mine and my daughters favorite games! we all love animals and to be able to take care of one without having the money to actually own one is a great thing. It is also a good learning tool for children.  It is always difficult to explain to children what it takes to take care of an animal. This game actually helps them find out how much work it actually is.
B00005RIKI|5.0|I love this album. the best LS for me. Simple man, freebird are excellent songs, the bonus tracks are very well, specially the freebird version

B000J670ZI|5.0|I've been watching this my whole live and could watch it over and over. It never gets old! I love it!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|When I choose a novel it's to get involved in the characters.  I enjoyed this book and I would recommend it....it was recommended to me.  I was surprised at the twist at the end but I guess it went with the flow of the circumstances and the personalities of the characters.  It is by far an easy read.  I think whoever reads it, will enjoy the time turning the pages.
B000UBOS0M|4.0|Monk and Coltrane bring a blend of soul and cool to a likable presentation of many of their favorites. I am glad they did it and I am glad I have it.
B008597UP6|3.0|I read this immediately after reading &#34;The Trial&#34;, so I expected too much.  It was an interesting read, but not nearly as thought-provoking and edgy as &#34;The Trial&#34; and many of his short stories.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think that this app is fun for kids. It also teaches them some responsibility too. It's also a fun way to pass the time for us adults.
B00B935SUY|5.0|Dave Grohl hits another home run as he did with Nirvana and the Foo's. The history, music, vibes and description of making music is spot on throughout this film. I would def recommend this to anyone, musician or not,
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is a great book that you just can't put down. I would recommend this book to any adult reader
B004YCKJSS|4.0|this is a classic movie that never gets old. maybe it's because i grew up in a town like this one but regardless, the cast is great, the story is common and it's just a fun one to watch.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|this is crazy candy Rufus games I love this game so much I love playing mincraft it is crazy man
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|I really didn't expect much of a third MIB movie but I gave it a whirl because I truly love to watch Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones and Josh Brolin. Throw in Emma Thompson and it's a party! This movie was fun to watch, aesthtically pleasing and creative, and both funny as well as sad. It might be the best one yet.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I love this game having a story line between object find screens is so interesting I couldn't stop playing I had to see what happens next. super fun,  interesting,  and great find pictures
B007FEFLTO|5.0|The story and characters from the first book were are wonderful woven in. I can't imagine what is under to come!!! Read this trilogy
0385737955|4.0|I really like James Dashner as a person, and I loved the pacing of this book.  If I was rating this book on pacing alone, it would have been 6 stars on a 5 star scale.  Thomas was a great protagonist, adept and confused -- as anyone trying to solve a maze would be.  The setting itself was fantastic as well, one of the best I've read in a long time.<br /><br />The only serious issue I had with the book was the fact that Dashner didn't spend enough time with us \\"stuck\\" in the maze.  Apparently, all of the other boys were not very bright because Thomas managed to solve it quickly -- so quickly, in fact, that I was actually disappointed with it.  The setting itself was one of the best parts of the book, and it seemed like we were out of the maze before I even had a chance to appreciate it.  Or to worry that they might not be able to get out.<br /><br />I rarely get done with a book the length of the Maze Runner and say, \\"That writer started too close to the action\\", but I think he did.
B000NNXEH0|5.0|I order a lot of things for my brother who is too lazy to do it for himself. This is one of those items. He wanted this movie for his 8th grade World History class. He uses a lot of movies to illustrate the life and history of other cultures during ancient times. He said the kids seemed to enjoy the story even though they had to read the subtitles.
B003U4ZOQ8|5.0|Still as fun to watch as the first time.  A show you really have to pay attention to if you want to follow the plot line.  Unlike most of the drivel on today that you can watch in your sleep.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Sorry but this is the WORST trilogy to hit the shelves or in my case to hit my ipad.  Since I am an avid reader, I flew through the book in a day, but I skipped a few paragraphs here and there.  A girl can only bite her lip so many times and succumb to an egomaniac.<br />People claim that this book is filled with kink.  Really? Kink? I had more kink in my 80's perm than this book.  Maybe as Americans (as the author is British) we are exposed to and accept more risque behavior.  I dont know.  But the story was unbelievable, the characters were flat and one sided, and the 'sex' was yawn.....zzzzzzzzzzz.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|i<br /><br />wish i could set it to not reshuffle when no matches are left. that sure makes it impossible to lose!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Free me from this treachery!  Thank GOD this is the last volume of this book series.  Again she left me with a cliffhanger on book 2 so in my quest to finish this waste of time, YES I WILL CONQUER! I read this last installment of drudgery.  But now...Now I am free.  I know how it ends...anti-climactic (pun intended). If you want to read it, get it on an e-book....I cannot fathom anyone killing a tree to print this book.  Save the trees...
B000G6R7B8|5.0|I have seen some sad reviews about this watch. I do not believe them. This watch is of high quality. You are getting a Seiko for the price of a Timex. It is easy to read. So comfortable, you forget you are wearing it. It is somewhat smallish, yet quite attractive. It does not over power the wrist.<br /><br />Accuracy is pretty good for an Automatic. It was giving me +-40 seconds a week, but is seems to be settling down to about -+20 seconds. It is also adjustable, so any jeweler can do the adjustment for you. I recommend it.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Bad. Bad. Bad. It CAN get worse. Why did I read it you ask? Because she did one thing right - she left the end of the first book as a cliffhanger. I hate/love a cliffhanger because I need to have a story wrapped up in a nice neat bow...or I guess in this case in handcuffs? Oye Vey!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|If I had not gotten this game for my granddaughter then she would have thrown a fit.She loves this game and so do I.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Love this app. Keeps me focused and engaged. I enjoy them when I can't sleep at night and don't want to bother my husband with the tv..
0316212377|4.0|A little heavy going at times but still a cracking yarn. I love the whole idea of the Culture and I am glad this goes someway towards explaining its origins. I would like more of an understanding of the whole thing though.
B0040X46TE|5.0|I purchased this CD for my mother who enjoys &#34;IZ's&#34; music.  She is also a fan of &#34;Don HO&#34;, so it makes her happy...
B005NACYQU|5.0|I've only recently discovered Neil Gaiman but I think he is one of my favorite authors. His prose is spectacular, his characters are so believable even though its a Si-Fi, Horror, Fantasy book. This is now a must read as far as I am concerned.
B00B3MN65K|5.0|ve been A josh Groban fan for years, This is a very good listen and I go to bed each night with it playing,love love love it
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This game is so fun to play! it was worth 99 cents! i love playing this with my niece! This is such an Awesome game
B005PK57NU|5.0|I love this show.  I got the first season for my wife as a gift  and, being a good husband, I sat and watched with her.  Well, this is season 3 and I'm still watching with her so I'd say it's good.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best show I have seen.  It's really intense and they do a great job of introducing survivors and eliminating group members enough that you could believe it is real almost. Zombies are awesome makeup is totally sweet. All of my buddies watch this show too. Each season gets better.
B008CJ0KEM|5.0|If you have not been following this Canadian production ... you are missing out ...<br /><br />Sexy, funny, great story writing ... all around perfect show!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game but highly addictive! My kid got me into this now I can't put it down with you could go passed level 30.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|i am not a big game player - but the more i caught on - the more challenged i felt in getting faster and spotting the moves.
B00846F1YW|3.0|This game is ok but some of the objects are hidden under the unmovable menu and you should be able to skip the freaking betoken glass puzzle.  You can probably tell I'm stuck there. Help! I can't get past that puzzle to tell if I really like the rest or not. I'll let you know more later one way or another.
B004GYY714|5.0|I haven't had any problems with it and I can get my local stations easily.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B00006G8HX|5.0|I've seen everyone of them and love them.  This is really a pivotal movie if you are into the series.
B00AFEXRME|1.0|The profanity, drug use, and other graphic material did not bother me.  If you are complaining about this, obviously you haven't been out of the house much.<br />OK in-flight action, but it didn't last long.  Denzel's dialogue was also dry and uninteresting the entire time.  I understand he was playing the role of staying calm under pressure, but it was very lame.  He seemed very out of place in this role.<br />POOR message.  i.e. Possible to not only fly an airplane well, but also crash land one at a .24BAC and high on cocaine.  AND have corrupt lawyers and union leaders get you off scott free.  DRUNK and drugged driving is a huge epidemic, and this film plays right into the &#34;i can do anything and get away with it&#34; attitude so prevalent today.  The icing on the cake is the end when Denzel says he'll only be locked up for 5 years!! For six counts of manslaughter and lying to federal investigators.  Nice touch!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have not met a Nicholas Sparks I didn't like, but I love this one. It is a very gripping story. And such a wonderful love story!
B0013NAP2G|2.0|Mariah has one of the most beautifully gifted voices in the world. I love her new identity and the R & B direction that she went with her career.<br />However, this concert is one of the worst I have seen. She barely sings to her songs, just adds styling in while her background singers belt it out. And the few times she actually sings her songs, you are almost relieved for her and for the fans that paid to see the concert. She rambles on and on in between songs and although she truly seems to love her fans and wants to involve them, she does not reward them with well sung music.<br /><br />All that being said, it was watchable, but then again, a train wreck is watchable too.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Good character development, careful use of foreshadowing, incredible twists at several points throughout the book.<br />I would highly recommend it!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Ha, first off - it seems funny to me to be reviewing a classic like this one, since it is such a highly regarded masterpiece. There is even a \\"Victor Hugo Avenue\\" in France, I believe - a highly revered figure there especially as he brought a lot of critical issues of the time to light.<br />In sum - I love this story - have seen the play a few times and wanted to read the book before seeing the latest movie version.<br />That being said - Victor Hugo digresses for hundreds of pages at a time; on different topics, war, convents, slang - it which was all probably very ground breaking at the time, but it is very hard to muscle through when you want to get to the meat of the story. However, this could be indicative of society today - our 30 minute sitcom inclinations - asking for the short story, all action, comedy and romance, no history. So, maybe part of Mr. Hugo's genius was keeping you in suspense of the story whilst imparting his detailed analysis of various aspects of life during that time period and life in general for that matter.<br />What can I say, it's a classic - read it, decide for yourself - just be ready for some digression!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like the idea of having a couple games on my Kindle to play when I have some down time.  It is a fun game to play.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|What can I say about a DVD.  The seller shipped the item in a very timely manner, and this particular purchase came with a digital product so I could view it on my computer immediately before the actual DVD arrived.  That was nice.  The DVD was new, and excellent.  Of course it didn't hurt anything since I love this movie.  I'm a fan of the Christmas holiday season so I will be watching this movie, Polar Express, again by sometime in July!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Wonderfully written fable. Makes one think about how we value and use the time given us. It is a quick read and I recommended it as a book you will remember.
B0028KF4M4|4.0|This is a cool series keeps you on the edge of your seat and waiting for the next step. Its great
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is well worth the price. It's very entertaining, reasonably challenging, and is really funny. Great for Phineas and Fern fans, too!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great show and very entertaining.  It keeps me coming back to view more episodes.  I can't wait for next season.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Very twisty movie, lots of action, kind of a strange pace for a Bond film, but in the end it worked itself out and got all the kinks out.
B005RJ6AIK|4.0|The music was a perfect compliment to the mood of the movie, which by the way captured the essence of the Hawaiian culture and how it plays out in everyday life and the decisions we make.  These great Hawaiian artists really know their music and their people!
0307463745|4.0|I enjoyed this book for its simple approach to starting a business, and I had already come to many of the same conclusions on my own. However, there was a little bit of smugness in the message -  &#34;we did these things and now we are successful - so this is all you need to know!&#34; Well, it doesn't work for everyone, because not everyone has that &#34;million dollar idea&#34; or the energy and enthusiasm that the author clearly possesses. Developing software that people can use is an art, but it is also one that doesn't require huge amounts of capital investment to get started.<br /><br />That said, I am a customer of Mr. Fried's and thoroughly enjoy using his software product. If you want to get a refreshing perspective on how to start a business that doesn't include the same old tired MBA speak, this may be up your alley.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|Hawaii is more than just a pretty backdrop in this movie...it plays out as one of the characters.  George Clooney was perfect for this role, vulnerable and strong at the same time.  The movie was funny when it needed to be and heartbreaking when it needed to be.  One of those movies that I can watch over and over again!!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I really like this game. The only frustrating thing is having  to \\"kill all the birds\\" in one level before you can move on to the next one. Well worth your time!
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|I have been gluten free for some time. It feels better in my system. The book helps explain why and provided the research to back it up.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I have this on my pc and my fire and love it!  I love any game I win almost every time!
B003M70O5O|5.0|Was able to stream the entire season in HD, loved it.  Amazon Prime pays for itself again, I will definitely be renewing.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|This was a feel good movie without the need for a lot of thought.  For a quiet evening in & where you're not expecting great cinematography, this is a good bet.
B00ANW33CM|5.0|I love re4gular mahjong and this 3D version I love more.  It is not as dificut since there does not seem to be the same rules such as taking pieces from the middle but future games will hopefully include that.  I just think the graphics are great for an android game and I like memory games.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is the most addicting show I have every watched. I love it. Right balance of storyline and thriller to keep you watching!
B00B01XDTI|1.0|Short and Sweet:  This film was collection of three minute attempts at fright (of varying degrees of effectiveness) all filmed to get the most bang for buck out of whichever abandoned factory it was they rented for filming.  The plot (please insert scare quotes) is not much more than a series of Intro to Theater Arts level dialogues designed to offer the barest plausibility as to what the aforementioned fright scenes have in common (other than the abandoned factory where they were filmed).  Adelaide Clemens (i.e., Sharon/Heather/the Warm Fuzzy at the Bottom of Alessa's Black Soul/Whatever) seems to have been hired solely for her ability to scream on cue, which she sometimes does convincingly and other times just phones in (e.g., when she meets the ridiculous manikin/spider thing).  Speaking of the ridiculous manikin/spider thing, thank you Silent Hill: Revelation for providing a textbook example for how to misspend what appears to have been a decent production budget; every teacher of a Film Studies 101 class needs to cut you a check.  Also, thanks to the ridiculous manikin/spider thing, I now have a pretty clear idea of what Georgia O'Keeffe's work would have looked like if she had been fixated on a different human aperture.  These are just the highlights; this film is a deluxe burrito of horror clichés (self-serving plug: for my general hatred of recent clichés, see my review of The Last Exorcism).  Oh yeah, Kit Harrington, Silent Hill is in America not the UK, so fight the urge to talk like you're in middling episode of Cadfael when your character ends up there.
B009AMALGM|5.0|I do agree with most people that the 1st one is the best, but I liked this one too. U just know somethings about to happen & u try to prepare yourself & I jumped anyways!  Everybody is entitled to their own opinion & not everybody will like it, but I did.
B004L0NGEC|5.0|I have thousands of pictures on Picasa Web Album. After I got the Kindle Fire HD, I tried to access the photo albums the same way as on desktop computer, through Picasa website. It only showed small thumbnail-ish pictures. Not usable. Then I read the Amazon review of PicFolio and decided to give it a try. Great results with that little app. Pictures looks great, better than on my desktop to be honest. You can download all photos to your Kindle or access through Wi-Fi. Very nice product. Worth every penny of that $3.
B00BCOQSSQ|4.0|This is a story that tells a decent tale, and is a nice light read.<br />While it does set things up for another in the series, it ends well, and for that I am grateful (having recently finished the Wheel of Time series).
B008M7JODC|5.0|We cannot wait to watch season 2 now. We loved how the show ended with and leaves next season wide open.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I don't have cable so this gives me an up to date opportunity to watch the season as it unfolds. Fantastic show! Could stand to knock that price down a little!
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Very fun film. Sure it has an established script but you can never have too many feel-good movies.Why spend time and money on something that makes you feel lousy? I save my $ for happy stuff.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I decided to try it because amazon recommended it to me and it got great feedback.  I was hooked after the first chapter & couldnt put it down.  The only reason I didn't give it all 5 stars is because its not the \\"science fiction\\" I am used to reading & was kind of disappointed no crazy aliens popped up anywhere...lol.  But it is a very intelligently written book and I was glad to have read it.
B008Q09K2U|4.0|Topical thriller, well constructed and good development of the plot, but laden with his usual wry and incredibly good humour.
0439023521|4.0|Review of Hunger Games<br />Wesley Powell<br />Composition II<br />Excelsior College<br /><br />  Abstract<br />Authors strive to intrigue their readers through a series of actions and human responses to conflicts by carefully planning out the plot and structure of the story. The plot is the main idea and the subsequent actions that build up to the climax and resolution. Roberts explains the relation of plot and structure as follows, \\"unlike plot, which is concerned with conflict or conflicts, structure defines the layout of works- the ways in which the story, play, or poem is shaped\\" (Roberts, 2012). A quick review of the popular novel The Hunger Games written by Suzanne Collins will allow us to see how the plot of a story plays out and the various types of structure able authors to mystify a reader with words.<br /><br />\\"I volunteer!\\" I gasp. \\"I volunteer as tribute\\" (Collins, 2008). These words muttered by Katniss Everdeen as she desperately tries to protect her younger sister are the same words that throw her into an arena with people who are out for her blood. The main plot of this story concerns a young girl who is forced to fight to the death against others she has never come into contact with except a young boy from her village. Panem is made up of the Capitol and twelve districts that are fiercely controlled by President Snow. The Hunger Games were conceived as a way to prove superiority of the Capitol over the districts and to punish them for past rebellious actions. Collins quickly puts the plot of the story in motion when Katniss volunteers to fight on behalf of her sister; this is the first major conflict. Stories are made up mostly of actions or incidents that follow one another in chronological order which is considered the plot (Roberts, 2012). Several actions and events occur throughout the story causing conflict for Katniss and putting her in a position to make decisions that subsequently lead to other events, shaping her future and fate. Robertsstates that, \\"conflicts promote characters to engage in the decisions, actions, responses, and interactions that make up fictional literature.\\" At the beginning of the story Katniss is forced to fight to her death in the upcoming Hunger Games therefore creating a conflict which requires decisions such as what tactic she will use, what weapons will be available, how she will cope with killing another human and so on.  Once Katniss makes a decision to resolve a conflict it opens the door to another requiring yet another decision to be made creating a domino effect until the end of the story. Depending on what type of story the author is writing, the plot may be revealed in various ways which leads into how a story is structured.<br />Formal structures of a story consist of five parts that follow each other in exact order. Stories usually begin with background information, setting the scene, and/or other important information that pulls the reader in and makes them acquainted with the characters in the story; this is the exposition. Next is the complication which is the plot and lays out the major conflicts. Crisis and Climax follow in order and are sometimes very difficult to distinguish. During the crisis, a decision or an action to resolve the conflict is undertaken and the climax is a consequence of that crisis and is considered the highpoint in the story leading to the resolution (Roberts, 2012). Resolution is intended to finish up the story and make sense of previous sections. The Hunger Games is not a formal structured story and is purposefully designed to entice the reader by leaving out bits of crucial information about characters or throwing in new events that complicate the matter at hand. This technique is done by manipulating the structure by placing the exposition within the middle or ends of the story instead of in the beginning. For example, Katniss is aware that one other person from her district is competing in the games with her but she does not haveany affiliation with him at first making her decision to kill him easy but right before the games begin, Peeta (the other tribute), throws a major conflict at Katniss. The following is part of an interview with Peeta where this conflict unfolds.<br />\\"Handsome lad like you. There must be some special girl. Come on, what's her name?\\" says Caesar. Peeta sighs. \\"Well, there is this one girl. I've had a crush on her since I can remember. But I'm pretty sure she didn't know I was alive until the reaping.\\" Sounds of sympathy from the crowd. Unrequited love they can relate to. \\"She have another fellow?\\" asks Caesar. \\"I don't know, but a lot of boys like her,\\" says Peeta. \\"So, here's what you do. You win, you go home. She can't turn you down then, eh?\\" says Caesar encouragingly. \\"I don't think its going to work out. Winning....won't help in my case,\\" says Peeta. \\"Why ever not?\\" says Caesar, mystified. Peeta blushed beet red and stammers out. \\"Because...because...she came here with me.\\" (Collins, 2008)<br />By withholding the facts about Peetas feelings for Katniss in the beginning and revealing them in the middle of the story adds a twist that hooks readers into the plot. This technique is also used to write mystery stories where the reader is aware of facts that the characters themselves are oblivious to.<br />Every story, novel, poem or piece of literature you may read contains a plot with conflicts and is structured in a way that aids the writer in conveying the message to the reader. It is important to understand the parts of a formal structure and what they mean so you can locate all the pieces of the puzzle and know how to put them together to reveal the plot.<br /><br />References:<br />* Collins, S.

B000IDEQTK|5.0|I enjoy Helen Hunt and Scarlet Johansen was a good contrast. The plot had an unexpected twist.  You might enjoy it.,
B004PGNB1K|5.0|Location: Everywhere Time: Always<br /><br />Just wanted to add my 5 stars after reading this book for the gazillionth time. How freaking good are the one liners in these books. You know a book is good when you start borrowing a line or two in real life situations.<br /><br />My personal favourites:<br /><br />\\"You lack the requisite spine and testicular fortitude to study under me.\\"<br /><br />\\"I've waited a long time to show these flowers how pretty you are\\"<br /><br />I mean how beautiful is the writing. It's disgusting really.<br /><br />I see many reviewers complain how the story doesn't progress and how Kvothe is a stupid jackass. Lets be honest. Both of these statements are true. I for one couldn't care in the slightest.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Clancy does it again! A great continuation of the Jack Ryan series of novels.I hope he keeps them coming quickly.
B008M7JODC|5.0|Really enjoy watching this show.  Once you start an episode you'll keep watching.  I can't wait to reach the finale, which I heard is amazing.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|It serves its purpose. It says that it is a calculator and that is exactly what it is. The end.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|Fight scenes that look like a choreographed dance, consistently predictable throughout (I could go on but Im in a hurry to leave) In short, one of the worst films I've seen in a long while. Skyfall succeeds in doing what I thought impossible though, It makes a Bruce Willis movie look good. Done with Bond movies.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|entertaining &amp; varied puzzles and games with different levels of difficulty. was not enough explanation on mini games. most was enjoyable.

B000I9U8VO|4.0|Marvel has ran the gambit on its most basic comic series and this is a great example of what you used to read and play in your mind.  The comic's were more entertaining but I guess I am stating my age.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I appreciate the dialogue in this series. It has awesome conversation and one-liners that make the series witty and charming. It's refreshing.
B007V5CF5K|4.0|Lots to fun, lots of things to find,<br />good puzzles, not many interruptions, and then only to ask you to rate the game. It's nice to buy a game and just get to play it, with no pressure!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I liked the basis of the movie but I did not like that it started out with full nudity and it was entirely unnecessary and did not add to the story. This was shocking that this was put in a action movie when it was entirely unnecessary<br /><br />I liked the movie but wash shocked at the opening scene with a woman fully nude walking around. This was in  no way necessary to the story line and it detracted rather than added to the enjoyment of the movie. I would not recommend this for young people. What a shame that the actors and the movie industry has chosen to inject unnecessary sex and nudity into a movie that could and would be excellent without it. THIS WAS THE REASON FOR FOUR STAR RATING AND IT COULD HAVE BEEN FIVE WITHOUT IT.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Enjoyed this movie.  If you are expecting a lot of character development, this isn't for you.  It you like kids animation this is good.
B008X6JP3G|5.0|This is such a good movie!!It keeps your interest! There was so much going on!!! Kevin Costner is such a talented<br />actor! He can put himself into any role and make it so memorable!!
0307591549|5.0|I recently had the immense pleasure of hearing Shawn Achor the author of \\"The Happiness Advantage\\" speak for nearly 2 hours. I had previously read his book and after hearing him speak I am convinced that \\"The Happiness Advantage\\" along with Jeff Olson's\\" The Slight Edge\\" are 2 books that I think everyone should read along with the Bible. In his book, Shawn disproves the conventional wisdom that success brings about happiness when actually happiness breeds success. When we are positive, our brains become more engaged, creative, motivated, energetic and productive.<br /> His research has shown that positive thinking and happiness can produce physical changes in the brain and body leading to longevity and reduced illness. All of his findings were produced through scientific studies.  His book outlines several easy to apply principles that will allow you to take control of your happiness and guide your life. I recommend this book to everyone.
B009CF7GRY|5.0|I loved this movie when it originally came out.  Was curious to see if this one would even come close to that one.  It was a great movie that I enjoyed just like the original.

B00BESLHEA|2.0|Not Quintin's best simply a pot boiler for him and the incredible talent he enlisted for this movie...  Russell Crowe and Lucy Liu; what a waste.  This movie had no Tarantino magic or art.  He should have been working on Kill Bill III but perhaps chose this weak script because he couldn't build on the genre of a martial arts film any further.  Watch it if you would and let me know if my review missed something.  I'll respect your reply...
B00846REIS|5.0|Not as good as the Fifty Shades series, but a close second! I got lost in these books and I can't wait for the third book to come out!

B00992CF6W|5.0|failure to disregard the warning can result in hours of playing love the game so I recommend to bye it have fun with it.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Loved this book. Really felt the characters. Didn't want it to end, although I didn't care for the ending(or, the surprise of the ending). Good book overall!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Five Stars for a Five star Cast and movie! I had seen this movie in the theatre and I couldn't wait to buy a copy. It is a thoughtful depiction of the lives of several people at similar crossroads in life who ultimately chose the road to India where their individual situations collide and intertwine leading them down very different paths than they had imagined for themselves. Heartwarming and very well produced.

1592407889|4.0|Sachi Parker seems to me to fall into the Hollywood cliche as a child of a famous parent. The parent so busy with their life and career has no time for nurturing their child. They love the child in their own way, but it is not enough for the child. The child is often left to their own resources and grow up with drugs or alcohol as their support. This was not Sachi Parker's life, but she was alone and seemed to suffer from emotional abuse. To be the daughter of Shirley MacLaine is a very hard act to follow, and this seems to be the mark left for Sachi.<br /><br />Sachi spent much of her life with her father, Steve, in Japan. He was a tightly controlled, emotionally absent man, who it turns out was stealing millions from his wife, Shirley. This was a distant marriage, with both living in separate corners of the world. Sachi was often overlooked with no one to care for her. She managed her life, her mother was tight with her money and would not support her in college. She did provide for exclusive boarding schools, and thought that was enough. I wondered while reading this book what kind of childhood Shirley had, not a happy one. She left home at an early age to find her way, and she expected Sachi would do the same.<br /><br />Sachi discovered that she was a good actor, her mother told her so, but, at every turn, her mother denigrated her acting. No one could or would ever be as good as Shirley. Shirley did not suffer competition. She did whatever was necessary to be on top, even if it meant conniving and manipulating the career of her daughter. This is a sad commentary. Both women, I would think would welcome a relationship, but it seems Shirley can only tolerate people in 4 hour blocks. Shirley's beliefs in her lives in the past are contrary to most, but she remains strong in what she believes. It seems that Sachi needed to play in the back pocket, in order to remain on Shirley's good side..<br /><br />I have always admired Shirley MacLaine, a remarkable actress, but it appears she lacked the parental abilities we would all want in a mother. This book does change my outlook about Shirley, she still remains a terrific actress, but somewhere she was lacking the feelings and empathy necessary to be an effective mother. She had no resources to learn from, it seems her parents were also absent emotionally. I do think Sachi Parker has enough intelligence and gumption to move on with her life. I do wonder if this book will push enough of an edge between Sachi and her mother. And, the children, will miss the time with their grandmother. How sad for everyone.<br /><br />This is a book of Sachi Parker's life, Shirley MacLaine remains a big part of that life, but it seems not a happy one.<br /><br />Recommended. prisrob 02-18-13t it appears she lacked the parental abilities we would all want in a mother.

B005HEDIHG|5.0|Nothing beats the original.  I love the fact that I can watch these great shows without having to fork out a couple of bucks every time.
B000V5TV22|5.0|The receiver works well - I use it fairly frequently.  You do need to be aware that on Windows 7, if the GPS is plugged in prior to the navigation software being launched, Win7 will *INSIST* on trying to install the &#34;serial ballpoint mouse&#34; driver, and if it ever succeeds, you will find your mouse pointer jumping all over the place as the idiot microsoft operating system interprets the GPS as an ancient mouse input.  Microsoft is clearly to blame as the serial ballpoint mouse was a piece of crap and *NO_ONE* uses any such thing today - but after all, it was microsoft branded, so we *must* make every modern device and person stand back and honor that.  Flame off.  Back to the GPS - it's quick to lock, has WAAS (extra precision/correction), and sticks fine to the car top or hood.  A long USB cable can be run to it - I have run it on 20' cables, even though USB isn't really supposed to go that far.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had never read the books or seen the movies. I git my kindle and this was the first thing I downloaded and I absolutely love it.
B00796E7CA|1.0|This review is only for the Kindle version.  While reading this version, I was constantly distracted by the inclusion of the chapter headings into the text of the story.  For example, \\"of tuor and his coming to gondolin 25\\" is inserted into the middle of a sentence at location 356 of 9703.  I've had this same problem with other LOTR Kindle books by this publisher.
B006ATJXQW|3.0|***********SPOILER ALERT*************<br /><br />In general terms I enjoyed the complete saga. \\"The Maze Runner\\" was recommended by a book-shop girl after I mentioned her that I was reading the \\"Hunger Games\\" books. That first one I adquired as a physical book. Then I read \\"The Scorch Trials\\", \\"The Death Cure\\" and \\"The Kill Order\\" on Kindle format.<br /><br />With this prequel I was expecting a story that would explain more that relationship between Thomas, Teresa and Aris before the Mazes, and how the immunes were picked and sent to the Mazes; how were they lives before, and know more about their personalities before pressing the \\"reset\\" button on their brains. Instead we had to meet some other strangers, that to be honest, I didn't love as much as I loved the Gladers.<br /><br />When I accepted the fact this wasn't Thomas story anymore, I had the little hope to find Chancellor Paige at least, and to understand the reason of her decisions in the end of \\"The Death Cure\\", and why there was such a confidence on her. But no. She wasn't even mentioned.<br /><br />\\"The Maze Runner\\" was very slow on the beginning, something that I understood and thanked later as it's the way to tell us the story in Thomas' point of view (a guy with a mind in blank). Later it catched my honest interest and attention, as same on the next two books. On the other hand, on this one,\\"The Kill Order\\" it started slow and continues until the end, and the original formula doesn't work. At the last sentence of the novel, it remains a \\"mouth taste of nothingness\\".<br /><br />I would conclude that this book was okay, as a beggining of a different sequel. It is divorced from the saga, even if it's the same world. Maybe at some point I will give Dashner another shot with his other novels. But now it's time to turn the page and read other authors.
0385528752|5.0|This book was surprisingly quite a page-turner.  With lots of entertaining studies on human behavior included throughout, Chip and Dan Heath make some great arguments for being able to harness the part of your brain that resists things that seem unpleasant, like doing your taxes, staying on a diet, saving money, etc. and get all parts of your brain on board with changing your behavior.  Even more interesting to me, though, were the stories about effecting institutional change.  While I expected a certain amount of that in this book (it is, after, a business book), what I was most impressed with was the fact that institutional change can be brought about not just by CEOs, but also by people in positions of relatively little authority.  Using plenty of real life examples, it shows how even the lowest level employee has the ability to make substantive changes to their workplace and their company's productivity.  I found the ideas presented here to be very empowering.
0375428232|5.0|I needed to get 100/120 on the ibt in order to be accepted in a uk college. This book has a lot of interesting information that will help you improve every aspect of the test. I recommend it 100%.
B002L3ARRU|5.0|Whenever I feel a little down I pull this one out and everything looks brighter with smiles and laughs.  The performance at the parade always gets me moving!
B005H9B44A|5.0|So if you're looking for some fine piece of cinema, move on, please. This is pure, campy, spacecheese fun. And an excellent, excellent example of it. The actor playing Thor is delightful. Natalie Portman is adorable. The bad guy is sinister and conflicted and tortured (wo is me!) and the actor pulls it off just right. And hello, Sir Anthony Hopkins? You've got this brilliant, accomplished actor playing Thor's dad? Awesome. The big showy sci fi effects are fun. I have no idea how loyal it is to the Marvel universe, nor do I care. It was great fun, a wonderful escape from reality for a couple hours, and I would watch it again in a heartbeat.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Kept me wanting to turn the next page electronically to continue the storyline. It was a great story with a good plot.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This movie is all I was expecting & hoping for..........the cast, obviously, is incredible & the story is heartwarming & satisfying all around.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I wanted to see what everyone was raving about when season 3 started. This boxed set arrived quickly and brought me up to date!
B0094K1WZE|3.0|I found the movie a bit cheesy and far fetched. It was very hard for me to get into it.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|TO SAY THIS IS GRIPPING DRAMA IS GROSS UNDERSTATEMENT.  I CAN THINK OF NO ONE WHO COULD HAVE ACCOMPLISHED IN THIS ROLE, WHAT DENZEL, SO UNIQUELY, MASTERED.  HE IS MARVELOUSLY CONVINCING THROUGHOUT.
B00846REIS|5.0|Very good book about a relationship between individuals who both have gone through tough personal issues. I enjoyed reading it more than the 50 Shades series.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|THE TOTAL IMPACT OF THIS MOVIE CANNOT BE ACHIEVED WITH MERELY ONE VIEWING.  I SAW IT TWICE AT THE THEATER AND STILL WAS COMPELLED TO PURCHASE THE DVD.  HELEN HUNT'S PERFORMANCE, VIRTUALLY SOARED TO THE HEAVENS AND I DON;T THINK IT CAPABLE THAT SHE COULD EVER EXCEED THE PURE , UNBLEMISHED, COMPELLING ARTISTRY OF ACTING SHE ACHIEVED IN THIS WORK OF ART.  IT IS HARD FOR ME TO DETERMINE OTHERWISE THAN TO CONCLUDE THAT EACH OF THE PRINCIPLE ACTORS, ALMOST WITHOUT ANY LAPSE, CONTINUED THROUGHOUT, TO LIFT EACH OTHER TO GREATER AND EVER GREATER HEIGHTS OF COMPELLING, CONVINCING PERFORMANCES.  I CAN'T IMAGINE, IN MY MIND, HOW ELLEN HUNT REMAINED SO CONVINCING THROUGHOUT GIVEN THE GREAT DEMANDS IMPOSED IN PLAYING HER CHARACTER; SHE, 'VIRTUALLY' WAS THE PERSON SHE PORTRAYED.  THIS IS AN ELEGANT MOVIE!!
B004GHNIRK|4.0|While Victor Hugo is a bit wordy, this is a moving, complex story of people and the things they do for love. Worth the effort to stick with it!
B0025VLEM0|5.0|I loved this movie since the first time I've seen it.  I also enjoy all the other work with Nick Frost, SImon Pegg, and Edgar Wright collaborate on.  They work so well together and their ideas seem to mesh together so well.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|Who doesn't know a couple like Katherine and Heathcliff? Passionate, stormy and star crossed. A love story that keeps you involved to the very end.
B0068FYZ3Y|5.0|I know that other movies like Saving Private Ryan (which I also own) are to be considered among the best War movies, but the Taratino spin on this movie just does it for me.  The picture quality is great and I love that it came with a digital copy which I easily added to my iTunes library.  Overall, a great purchase.
B008BM9L72|4.0|Couldn't put it down. Apart from the kinkiness the characters were brilliantly written with all their flaws and hang ups. Loved it and will read it again.
B000FBJAF0|5.0|Absolutely top notch story. I worried about the chapter names thinking it would be back and forth in the story but he tied it together so good I could not put book down. Finished it in 2 days. Loved it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Keeping me on my toes like always. A picture of the directors of Walking Dead deserve to be put in the dictionary next to Suspensful!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Its been a long time that I have been obsessed with such great television. What a welcome relief from prime time tv and ridiculous reality shows!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved the book. I always wish they would not end. I can't wait to see what else this author will write about.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This is totally out of my usual reading genres. The way all the separate narratives blended together surprised me. It was a great book. A lot of military talk but so touching and human in nature. I cried a few times... I'm a sissy sometimes. Loved it. Recommended it to my husband even.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved the book. I always wish they would not end. I can't wait to see what else this author will write about.
B00ANYJ3NI|5.0|This book explains an extremely complicated concept in a very accessible way.  He makes it engaging, darkly funny, and easy to read.  I read this instead of my homework, when I want to take a guilty-pleasure break!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the book. I always wish they would not end. I can't wait to see what else this author will write about.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could not stop reading this book until it was a finished! Can not wait to start the next one!<br />Enjoyed
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the book. I always wish they would not end. I can't wait to see what else this author will write about.
B008476HBM|5.0|I enjoyed this e-book very much because I have seen versions of the film and TV presentations and reading the book gives a more indepth study of the writing style of Jane Austen.  The film and TV presentations couldn't include everything in the book such as a study of each main character.  You must read the book slowly to enjoy her usage of words or you will miss the message because there are so many words to describe an event, person, scene, experience, etc.  This book is very similar to a Harry Potter book - you need to read it more than once to capture the little things lead to something bigger.  She gets you involved with her characters and you feel for them and you might even cry with them.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|Batman and Superman fight it out when Batman refuses to listen and stop fighting the criminals of Gotham. Great film!
1595828753|4.0|The storyline takes place after the final season of the show and gives a great bridge between the original show and The Legend of Korra! The art is beautiful and it keeps to feel of the original show. Overall a great read and a great price offered by Amazon.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Another awesome book well written by Suzanne Collins.  I couldn't put this book down.  Can't wait to read the next one.  Lots of turns and twists in this one.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Ana, in many ways, is a character many women can relate to. As I read this book, it opened my mind t all the possible things I'd be willing to tolerate in a relationship. This book helps one realize the truth behind compromise. I would definitely recommend this book to all of my friends and family, seeing that it is my 3rd time reading it.
B00A6D5GBE|1.0|This app has never worked.  It crashes my tablet every time I try to turn it on.  Don't waste time.
B00683JK9K|4.0|This fun and great puzzle game. you can do the same puzzle whether there are 90 or 500 pieces. get it
B006MW3V6U|4.0|I love this series. I was inspired to watch all three seasons. Just caught the last 3rd season episode and it was surprising
B005VTS4EY|4.0|a nice game to play when you have some time to kill. Keeps you thinking. Wish I had more time to play.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is unforgettable. I loved every aspect of it and fell \\"hopelessly\\" in love with Dean Holder along the way. This book shows us the lengths a guy will go to in order to protect the love of his life for her own sake. I loved every minute of it and was not expecting how great it actually was. I give Hopeless five stars and I give Colleen Hoover five stars. Excellent work.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I downloaded a few PDF files from the Internet (e.g. camera user guide) but I could not figure out how to open them or have the PDFs available in the docs folder on my Kindle Fire HD. This app allowed me to move things around in to the folders that I wanted them in - so I moved the files from my downloads folder to my docs folder. I am not a techie but I was able to figure this out in a minute or two. I did not have to read any user manual or guide to figure out how to do. It was pretty easy to use. Glad it was free because I really don't use it that much unless I need to move things around.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|cool game with cool graphics! love the speed of it, variety of scenery, music and theme, very realistic and fun
B009K0P10K|4.0|My husband calls this a prime time soap, and I agree!!  While this season keeps you guessing and siting on the edge of the seat just like season 1, it moves through the story lines so quickly I wonder how many seasons I will get to follow these characters I'm attached to. I love the addition of aiden, and was actually thankful Victoria survived, she is a wonderful villain! Love this show!!
B00881VLCE|2.0|moving the puzzle pieces to the right orientation was difficult and the puzzles themselves I did not think were appropriate
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|this show is so amazing<br />love to watch this great drama casted with<br />incredible actors and actresses<br />and to get to see the beautiful<br />home in which it is being filmed
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|Hard to get twenty words other than this film was excellent.  Although I knew the eventual outcome, it still kept me on my sit wondering how they would get out.  It was a nice touch to add the real people in a post film interview.  It's a good way to spend a cold winter night.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|love this show and its stars<br />been watching for years and<br />always looking forward to the next show<br />hope there is a season nine!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Another vehicle showing Denzel Washington's acting acumen.  The cast was complementary to Denzel; however, John Goodman was very good with his portrayal.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|This is a typical Bond movie, however it seemed to be a slower pace than what I expect from the series. It was
B008ASGP3U|4.0|I didn't think was the best Rebus book, but it is a servicably  good read.  This is common when an excellent author continues with a series, and no criticism of Rankin.
B006O6EOII|5.0|We LOVE all the Monster High girls:-)  Gholia has great accessories  and we think the Brain Bucket is a good joke:-)
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Very realistic.  You can always expect a good performance from Denzel.  The ending is heart warming, reassuring, and goes completely against the greediness and corruption our society typically snarfs down.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|good for peeople who don't have a horse but want one! it has many little games in it. buy the game!
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This is very well done.  I really enjoyed it!  It contains very good actors & I loved seeing the scenery!
0061478784|5.0|This is a quick read, and entertaining.  If you saw the movie, it is similar except the characters in the book are more flawed and believable.  The movie version of Howl is a bit sanitized - he is not as noble as depicted on film.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Amazing book, this man deserves to be remembered as a great American Hero!! I would recommend this book to anyone, even my wife!!
B000L212HC|5.0|Science fiction meets history in this fascinating tale of competing magicians.  The ending will surprise you, and make you think.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|plot good. characters likable. aliens not overdone. action great. the time went fast while watching this. not boring at all.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|This movie is so great--Wes Anderson is a genius.  As far as the DVD is concerned, no problems there. No frills either, just the movie pretty much and an interesting \\"making of\\" documentary.
B000WN60NG|5.0|This is a good movie with some good music.  Steve Vai is an incredible guitarist.  Starts off a little slow but gains your interest.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another excellent mystery, with the unpredictable twists and turns, and the gut wrenching story line that keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for the conclusion.
B009CPES4I|5.0|Wonderful scenery I want to go to India!  The ensemble of actors transported you to the country and made you want to stay there too!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Another jewel by DeMille. Intense, complicated and exciting. Tough to lay it down.You're in for an all-nighter on this one.
0345479092|5.0|Fabulous; I started giving this books as gifts for baby showers for new moms. I wish I had reviewed this book / DVD before I became a mama.
B006TLFPKO|4.0|Good movie that could have been great with more details.  Definatly made for the &#34;tween&#34; population with parts blurred out so parents couldn't complain about the movie being too graphic.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game! It is very responsive to the touch. I read a few reviews about timer but you can turn it off in options. You can also turn off the music. I like it more that way the timer moves so fast it was distracting.
B0025UHKNS|3.0|Very difficult to manage the Basel touch . Simple operation take long and frustrating, not responding or mistakenly operate wrong action . While running , view switch to satellite and refusing to return back to training information
B007HACDLK|3.0|Good solid addition to the series. Have to make up more words to keep amazon happy before I can submit the review.  Brevity isn't the soul of wit to Amazon I guess
B00821OX98|5.0|We had never seen this show prior to seeing it on the Amazon lineup and love it!<br />Especially love having access to the entire season and not having to wait a week to see<br />a new episode.
B0076DELIG|3.0|An acceptable addition to the series.  Have to make up more words to keep amazon happy before I can submit the review.  Brevity isn't the soul of wit to Amazon I guess
B000JG9ZXI|5.0|A classic.  Everyone should see this excellent movie.  Full of suspense yet no violence as only Alfred Hitchcock can do.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|castle is awesome .<br />The story line always keep you intrigued and the character are soo easy to fall in love with so you root  for your favorites and  boo for the bad guys.
B00946WM6Q|5.0|Great movie.  If you're a Bond fan you've got to see it.  I usually hate watching these because of the violence, but this one didn't go over the top.
B00009NQQO|3.0|Like most bath toys this has a shelf life of a few months in my house. Maybe a year if you run it through the dishwasher often. The balls get gross on the inside and the net will start to smell bad. But my daughter's loved to play with it while it lasted :)
B00AJLHU3K|4.0|This is another fine album of music from the premier musician and guitarist, Richard Thompson.  I highly recommend it to you.
B000THGR0Q|5.0|Do you ever associate music with events in your life. This is one of those albums for me. I grew up in Southern California and this album was released while I was a teenager. At that time there was a renaissance pleasure faire near my house and this album struck me as a merry olde England type of album. Take a close look at the album cover photo and listen to the title track and tell me that you don't see and hear that as well. Even better, listen to Velvet Green and you should feel it even more so.<br /><br />I am a life long fan of Jethro Tull. I've seen them in concert and have a large collection of their music. In my humble opinion, this is Jethro Tull's finest album.
1433502410|5.0|Helped out in all my study work.if your looking for a Bible this is the one. You should have. Please get it if you can.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|THis was a great book.  Looked forward to reading every day and could not put it down!  Loved it.  On the second book now
B006LSZECO|5.0|I love Gillian Flynn!  This is the 3rd book I've read of hers and definitely the best.  It is awesome.  I cannot write much because of giving anything away--all I can say is it has been on the best seller top ten list for 35 weeks straight!!!!!!READ IT!
B009RH973I|4.0|this is a nice case, very serviceable not too expensiive. I chose this color to make it easily dicernable from others in the family.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I liked this book.  this is not your typical romance.  Definitely worth reading if you are a romantic. I like the twist.
B009G78EE2|5.0|This is a great album. Im a big hip hop lover and was highly surprised at this album. I heard \\"thrift shop\\" and seen a couple collabs with good artists and decided to give it a go and was not disappointed.
B006RUJST6|4.0|This was a great YA romance that I read.  I am in my 30's and still really enjoyed this book.  The characters are great and the plot is good.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is a mystery that shifts between a man and his missing wife. Each chapter is written from the viewpoint of one or the other and you impression of each changes as they tell their stories.<br /><br />The ending is not expected.<br /><br />I generally do not care for mysteries but I liked this one.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I love Gillian Flynn.  Just when you think you've figured it out- surprise!  She is a master of suspense and mystery--horror as well!  This is a definite read.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|So far, so good. No problems. Works as advertised.<br />I needed a calculator with a % symbol and this product met my needs.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This is a classic romance.  It will be for all time.  I loved the characters, the premise, and the outcome.  Any romance reader must read this book.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|A+++ to both this show AND to Amazon for offering it. The first 3 episodes were free to watch online via Fox and another TV show site, but starting with ep 4, you had to be a cable subscriber with a very limited number of cable providers in order to view them on the official website or upgrade your account on the TV watching site.<br /><br />Every episode so far has been full of twists and turns and KB is excellent in the main role. Ep 4 was probably the least interesting episode to date, but I think it was setting the stage for some pretty big surprises moving forward. I look forward to Mondays now!
B000UIVRXG|5.0|I love the Amazon Unbox Viewer..Makes downloading movies so easy. This is a great movie..Lots of laughs. You will not regret it.
1936850028|5.0|The author tells a great story of the life and growth of a citizen athlete from early childhood days pestering your parents to come along on ski trips, to some of the worlds greatest races. Reading Beyond Birkie Fever has re-ignited my passion for competition and lead me back into the life of a year round citizen athlete. This season I have prepared for my first Birkie.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This app is one of the best I have encountered for Spider Solitaire. It is so easy to play it's downright addicting.
B00A31UXLW|5.0|Tight plot, page turning and further development of the Bosch character.<br /><br />The depiction of LAPD internal politics nevers fails to fascinate.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This facebook app is great on the kindle fire. They seem to have worked out all the kinks. Great for heavy facebook users.
B005SDMDRW|3.0|Basically a series of plot lines.<br /><br />The stories are what I would imagine the moveimakers woud call &#34;in development&#34; which seems to be a euphemism for needs a fair bit of work.<br /><br />Classic Bosch though.
B003YV0A02|5.0|Die Hard is my all time favorite action movie and I did not flinch when looking to rent this. Unfortunately, about 3/4 through the movie, the stream started to break up and would 'catch' at certain points. I'm not sure what caused it, but it was the first time it had ever happened to me on Amazon.
B009NXV2RK|4.0|I've been a Clancy fan since Red October, which is a hard act to follow.<br /><br />Co-authoring might expand the Clancy franchise but at the expense that Clancy &#34;thing&#34;.<br /><br />Looking forward to how Junior matures and develops beyond his Dad.
1439152802|5.0|This book is on the list for books that make me ignore my children - especially towards the end when I did not want to have to put the book down.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Enjoy most all Harry Bosch books.  Have not read one about him for some time and this reminded me of how much I liked this character
B0020BUWX2|4.0|I liked this book. The ending was kind of iffy to leave it open for a sequel. I don't know if I will be purchasing the sequel.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Good story, easy to follow and quite enjoyable. Once I started reading, I didn't want to put it down until it was done. Let's just say if I were to wake up married, this wasn't a terrible way to be...lol
B002JWD6AS|3.0|This book was ok. It was an interesting take on werewolves but I won't be purchasing the other books in the series.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Downton is cliched and, in many parts, unbelievably contrived.  And I love it!  Maggie Smith is a precious gem. Dialogue is full of wit and intelligence. Buy it, watch it, cherish it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Best show ever- I only wish there were more episodes. I think this might be the best season yet although I thought that during season 2 as well ;)
B002SAUCBC|4.0|Stephen King is one of my favorite authors and most of his books are excellent.  &#34;The Long Walk&#34; was no exception, but I didn't like how it ended.
B000FC13Y0|5.0|The movie stardust is my all time favourite! The book was awesome and did not detract from the movie which was great! Love the characters, the story, the magic... alll of it!
B004JN1D2I|3.0|This series was made into a show on TV and is very popular. I figured this series would be fun to read. While its definitely got some great style and its very exciting, every chapter the story changes to another set of characters that you've never run into or heard of. So you might be just ending a great fight scene and then the chapter will end and the next will talk about some couple having a baby.Very VERY confusing! Can't get into it.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|From the way that the movie ended there there must be a sequel to fallow I will be waiting on the edge of my seat!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great book with great lessons in leadership. If youre in the military or just love sci-fi I would definitely recommend this book!
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|Your heart can't help but go out to the narrator Hazel and her love interest, Augustus, but the book is a little uneven. Though charming,funny, and very smart, both characters border on precocious and pretentious. So though this book is heartfelt  and likable, it's also a little cloying and overwritten; Hazel rails against conventionality and sentimentality, but that's what this book gives into in the end.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|As someone who grew up loving 2D side scrollers like Mario and the like, this was right up my alley. It's simple enough for kids, but adults may find themselves repeating levels a few times to get that gold medal too.<br /><br />The art and music are both phenomenal, and the work and love that went into this game very clearly shows. I can't wait for the level updates!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I can almost say I like it, but how to earn peanuts is a little baffling. DON'T want to buy them. A person could go in debt trying to keep up with the game! That to me is just wrong! The animals are at least more spunky!
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|took me a little time to get it to work, but I use it al the time now. its ok
B007N5YIUS|1.0|...bored me to near fury! I will stick to other apps like that for the time being, may be it will worth something later just not right now.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great read. Great details. Great story.  I love how you really want Pat to have his silver lining and root for him through the whole story.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read all the Vince Flynn books and each one is better then the last. I truly enjoyed this novel, if your a Flynn reader you will love this book as well
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  A wonderful mix of science and adventure.  Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys lots of great detail in a great story.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read! (and I've read a lot of books)  I am 46 years old, been reading everyday since ten, have read just about everything from non-fiction on...  This book made me laugh, cry, and mad as hell!  It was not &#34;predictable&#34;, so don't worry that you've got it figured out before you get there!  Can't wait to read more from Colleen Hoover!
B008TMA1LY|5.0|This game ended up being really addictive when I first started playing it that I had to stop lol I haven't really allowed myself to play it again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My Horse is by far the best horse app I have ever gotten. It feels as if I really am watching a horse. It is that realistic.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Easy to use. I like that everything can be color coded. You can email yourself the notes and make checklists which is awesome
B0055CS4UG|5.0|I found this book very helpfull with easy to do recipies, a lot of interesting tips and<br />i would definatley recomend it to everyone who loves to cook because there are loads of fantastic recipies.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Just like the iPhone version of the app but I HATE how large the pictures are on the newsfeed! Is it really that necessary to have the pictures that big?
B009OYSFDM|2.0|The lead is so wooden, it's painful to watch.  The story originally was interesting but now, borders on silly.  Arrow's sister rocks!
B008ASGP3U|5.0|I went into mourning when Rankin announced that the Rebus series was over, so I looked forward to this one. Rankin has taken to inserting guest appearances by characters from the old Rebus books and from his new police series. As always, character drives the book and the city of Edinburgh can be viewed as a character too. The plotting is as good as ever.
B0091REZMW|4.0|its an interesting game full of mystery . I enjoy playing it very much. I do think it should be a tiny bit easier to get nemesis though. everything else is good.
B000003TB6|5.0|classic album by a classic hip hop group, i now own every roots album! this is definitlely worth spending your money on!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|What a great series this is.  It gives us a historical look at a way of life we have never seen or experienced.  It portrays the waning years of an aristocratic system that had flourished in Britain for century's.  World War one changed life in Britain in a way no one could have anticipated and no one felt it more than the aristocrats.  Extremely well done.
B009LT1YZ6|5.0|One of the few games that I play with the sound on and up.<br />Soothing and satisfying.<br />You become the fish.<br />Yes.  Play this game.
B008GWSS6W|5.0|You can hardly go wrong with a John Wayne movie,  but this is a particularly good story about G.W. Mclintock who owns half of the territory, but is liked and respected by all.  There is a great deal of humor thrown into the story,  but also shows you how bad the Indians were treated by the US Government.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|We have been watching Fringe for several years and as the end of the series drew near, we were wondering how we would fill in that void. When our other favorites ended we bought the entire series on Amazon, so it was a natural to see if we could get Fringe as well. We were so excited to find it was available . And we were surprised how much we had forgotten about the first season. Now we can re-watch and catch details that we missed the first time we watched it...awesome!
B002WNC5BU|5.0|Item as described and quick shipment.  won't let me enter just that so here are more words so I can submit.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Traveling back and forth between two rooms can get boring, but it keeps the children and an adult working together to solve the image.
076790592X|5.0|I enjoyed this book to the utmost. Started reading and couldn't put it down. then I wanted to hear it and ordered the audio book...great book. I definitely recommend it.
B000641D2Y|5.0|Bought this to watch over the holidays with my kids. Still a great family movie to watch, even with my now grown kids!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|An excellent series for anyone who enjoys adventure, humor.  Excellent cast.  The best producer, many fine scenes that remind of a good western set in space.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Movie was very well acted and directed, but was not at all what one would anticipated from the trailer.  This is not a &#34;thriller&#34;, but more a discussion of an alcholic who can never pull it together although you keep hoping he will.  Had I known this, probably would not have rented.  Glad I'd didn't waste my time at the theater.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This is a great book. If I'd written this review before I finished all 3 I'd have given it 5 stars, because I honestly couldn't put it down. I read it because I really liked the movie and, as always, the book was SO much better!<br />That said, the third book disappointed me- but this review is for the first. And I still recommend the trilogy.
B0095P29EG|2.0|I only watched about 20 minutes of this before loosing interest. The best I can say is I stream it for free.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I love love love this series. You do need to watch from the beginning our you won't get it, but it is something well written and so different!! Love it!!
1435114949|4.0|It arrived on time and was exactly what I expected. The book looks great and all of the Sherlock stories are there and waiting to be read
B00008G8LM|5.0|This is my favorite movie.  I saw it when it came out and I loved it.  At that time I was teen age, I was wondering how I would be when I become an adult.
B0084B5TK8|3.0|Very wordy but interesting read.  Hard to relate to the way of life during this time period.<br />Would recommend this only to horror story enthusiast.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|LOVED this book - Hopeless<br /><br />Read it in a day - and then picked it back up again to read again!<br /><br />Story of a young girl that was taken, boy found her again, lost his sister and then the first girl started to remember her past life!<br /><br />great story!
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Not a bad game good if you have nothing to deffinently a diffrent mach up game wpuld recomend it to friends.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I  bought the app. then it won't  work or open. it was a waste of 7 dollars.in  my opien a ver much waste of money
B00AREIAI8|4.0|my daughter likes it. can get boring but keeps her attention. not bad for a free game. wish gems weren't so hard to get
B000EGDC0A|5.0|Love this woman's voice and the ethereal quality of the music that is soothing and melodic!Great dance music too!Cool duo!
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book even though I had to put it down and a absorb the content at times.  It was emotional for me because my Mother has Alzheimer's and gave me a tiny peek in how she views her own illness.
B001MSMULG|3.0|A very simple plot and a very predictable outcome makes it not a great story.<br />Daniel Silva has better novels<br />Would recommend for light entertainment
B009IQ0TGM|4.0|Thought we were getting another Duffy but this chic has a groove and can sing. Her voice is hot and her music is hotter.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Works well both on my phone, tablet, and computers well suggest this app to my students, children and family to use.
B0036UW09U|5.0|I have enjoyed this movie every since it first came out. To find it available on the Kindle was a real treat.
B009FZFONO|5.0|We cut cable a couple of years ago, tired of 150 channels of nothing.  We have hulu plus and netflix and we get the local channels over the air - in HD - for most major sporting events.  We have amazon prime and bought the current season of Walking Dead because we are hooked!
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|If you're going to watch Ted, the premise alone should have you prepared for a silly story. I laughed out loud and would watch it again.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This movie has fun characters you'll cheer for. Well acted and surprises throughout. Laugh out loud funny.  You'll want to watch it again and again.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|I really enjoyed the 2 Batman movies that preceded this one. However, this one was too long. I wouldn't have minded so much if the length had added to the story, but it felt like a tangent that should have been edited.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Bought Hotel Transylvania for my 12 year old daughter and the both of us loved it!<br />A wonderful movie and sweet story combined with great characters.<br />Cheers to the creators for finding fun and funny ways to honor the movie monsters we all know and love!<br />Very highly recommend giving this movie a go :)
0525478817|2.0|Perhaps I would have enjoyed this book if it hadn't been so similar to one of the story lines in My Sister's Keeper.  Because of that, I was comparing the two...and this was the one that fell very short.<br /><br />I have to say that while I'm happy for the author, I'm surprised at the high reviews for this novel.
B0031RS4UM|5.0|Just when you think you have a handle on Lee Child's story telling he throws in a twist the a U turn and you fight to keep up. Great read.
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|Funny and suitable for a wide audience. This is written very well and perfectly cast. I would definitely recommend this season to anyone.
2070643026|3.0|I am a French Student and I very much love the French Language. I am very serious about it and I study French everyday, for fun, and because I have to as part of my major. My native language is not French, it is Spanish, but I am also 100% fluent in English and thus French was not very complicated for me to learn. Either way, I read this book and had such a HARD time fully understanding. What helped me understand it better was that I had already read the Harry Potter Books in advance so whenever I did not know something, I would try to remember what the original book said and I just guessed what the meaning in French was. It contained the rarely used tense Passé Simple which made the reading even more difficult. If I had not read the Harry Potter Books in English First, I would have had such a Hard Time reading this book. I did find it very useful in building my French Phrases and Vocabulary, but like I said, I think it was too advanced. I consider myself an Intermediate French Student, so my word of advice is &#34;If you are a beginner, You are not going to understand this book at All&#34;. I think it is mainly meant for French Natives and or a possible Advance French Student.
B007FH9GT2|3.0|This was a bit of a let down. I really enjoyed the Swedish version, and I found myself comparing the two since they both followed the story line of the book.  Mara Rooney didn't fit the role in my opinion and that was a distraction. While she was a major issue, I felt Daniel Craig wasn't great in this either. If you're going to watch one version of this movie, I wouldn't pick this one.
032006865X|4.0|Very happy with the audio. The reader changes voices and keeps it interesting. Overall very satisfied with the product. I listen to it quite often because it helps with pronunciation and speaking french... It helps to first read the book, then read the book with the audio and finally just listen to the audio to gain French Listening skills.
B0031Q0XCA|4.0|This movie didn't make me feel sad or happy it was just blah but I guess that's how life is
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft IS so so so so so so so so amazingly awesome that pretty much all that I have been wanting to do is play minecraft all day.Its that awesome. And  I always have been looking for different mods and seeds.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really am surprised that this even exists.  It isn't necessary to buy things with real money love that in an app
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like this game to the ends of it and how you are able to fly at times thanks for making it
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This is a typical Grisham in the start.  The start is very riveting, but by the time you get to the middle of the book, the plot becomes quite predicable.<br />A good read if you want to pass time while traveling.
B007ZTLLMK|4.0|This is a amazing game challenging yet really fun just don't rage quit and you will be just fine and in the Find the 4 cans challenge where it gives you a hint. it is behind the movies on the bottom shelf :)
B004W1GCNC|4.0|I enjoyed the new upstairs/downstairs but was disappointed when I went to watch the next season and you had to pay on Amazon Prime. I would prefer if they included all or none of the seasons! The same happened with Dr. Who but not until after - I believe - the 7th season.
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|This game is stupid!!! Its fun until it freases up!! I liked it at first but now it totally freases up every time I try to play the game . Don't waist your time it takes up to much space. its terrible!!!don't download it!!!!!!!!
0743270754|5.0|After seeing the film, I wanted to read the book by Doris Kearns Goodwin - who is an outstanding biographer.<br />Actually, I am still reading it - but so far, I am not disappointed.  Her attention to details is extraordinary and<br />I learned so much more about this President than I had ever known.  She brings life to her characters unlike<br />most authors.  She gave this book a great title - &#34;political genius&#34; indeed - if we only had that today.
0385536828|3.0|With perhaps a nod towards Le Carre, this somewhat undecided novel roams around the internal workings of MI-5, the British internal security agency, by following the fledgling career of the attractive, twenty-something Serena Frome. Invariably, when intelligence agencies start meddling in the affairs of subjects and trying to influence events, there will be unexpected fallout. In this case, project \\"Sweet Tooth\\" is undermined by the appearance of raw emotions: love, lust, and jealousy.<br /><br />Serena, the daughter of an Anglican bishop, is an unsettled girl. She loves literature, but is persuaded to study \\"maths\\" at Cambridge by her mother; she barely scrapes by. Despite her smarts and understated beauty, Serena's love life is pretty much a dead-end. However, little does she know that a fulfilling summertime affair with an older history professor Tony Canning will alter her life forever. Unknowing to her, he subtly prepares her for working at MI-5, though she believes she is going to work for the Health and Social Security agency.<br /><br />Serena makes the best of a life as a low-level paper-shuffler, until, unexpectedly, one day she is summoned to the top floor to a room full of important looking people. It turns out that Serena is perfect for a mission: her good looks and knowledge of fiction make her ideally suited to recruit promising, young male writers who are inclined to favor Western perspectives over those of Communism. And Tom Haley, a college instructor and producer of a few short stories, is Serena's first target. Of course, none on this can be revealed; Serena merely represents a high-minded foundation interested in supporting the development of good literature.<br /><br />And so begins a life of pressure, deception, and doubt that Serena could not possibly have seen coming her way. To MI-5 this is not charity; they want results. Can Serena live a life of deception while emotionally engaging with a subject?<br /><br />Ultimately, the story-line of this book is pretty thin. The minimal cloak-and-dagger aspects are unsurprising, as well as are certain key betrayals. The book slows to a crawl at times with lengthy passages from Haley's stories. Serena is appealing, but the author burdens her with passivity and vacillation that is disappointing and out of step; Haley is an unconvincing character. And the author again employs the book within a book structure that is far more successful with ATONEMENT. The book leaves unfulfilled expectations raised early on.this book is pretty thin.

B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|I have seen all of the candidates and this one should win in my opinion. It has suspense patriotism and humor. The fact that it is based on true events makes it more touching. A great movie!
B00B3EVNEE|4.0|Some very good arrangements of some of the old blues standards.  Trower does an excellent job of providing some solid guitar work on these classic blues & rock selections.  Through the years he has always mixed a few of these type of selections in his live show, however on this CD the level of production raises the performance to a new level... A must for guitar players, very good recording....
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Thank you for taking the time to problem solve with me regarding my Kindle Fire.  I rellay appreciated your willingness to send me the part you felt was broken.  As it turned out, you were right, and I longer have any problems with my Kindle Fire.  Also, thank you for sending it in two days!
B008JFUTUY|5.0|Van Gogh, John Kennedy O'Toole, Kafka, Galileo, Poe, Keats, Gauguin and Bach were not truly recognized until after they died. It was the fault of both critics and the masses. If you've ever had your own successes and brilliant moves go unrecognized, then you can remember how frustrating that can be -- now imagine what is like to have world-level talent and never be able to share it with people.<br /><br />Sixto Rodriguez made an incredible album in 1970 and then followed it up with a very good one in 1971. Both were dismal failures. But his records made their way to South Africa, where he became the soundtrack of the anti-apartheid movement. Rodriquez stopped making records and worked in construction for 40 years, never rising above working class means. In 1997, two South Africans found him in Detroit and brought him to Cape Town for series of concerts. It is a powerful moment of recognition and redemption. Thankfully, the world has been able to show it's appreciation to Rodriguez while he is alive. Amazingly, he is not bitter or mournful over his time in the wilderness (or the horrific fact that he did not get any of the money from his sales in South Africa) -- at heart, he is a noble artist who was happy for any chance to play for people.<br /><br />The documentary is extremely well done. I recommend that you buy both of his albums.
B005Q46HZM|5.0|After listening to this recording,I imediately went to Amazon to see if Phil Harding has any more recordings out.Unfortunately I couldn't find any. This is an outstanding mix!!!!!!
B008MAI0WK|5.0|It was very useful for me to familiarize RPi .  Introduction to Linux was a bonus. I bought the kindle edition. Thank you
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a very fun, fast paced game that has endless possibilities of views. I have found this game to be very addictive. I play it on my Kindle Fire 8.9&#34; HD tablet and the colors just jump out at you. Probably the best free game I've ever played.
B001XV09UG|2.0|takes forever to get off the ground.  overacted throughout and generally overwrought and tiresome.  No wonder Tom and Nicole ended up divorced.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Hooked on it already. Very well written little game in 3D. Always tryingto better my own times. Simple yet challenging. Everyone's got to try it.
B00BESJYAY|4.0|The cinematography in Chasing Mavericks is some of the best in any surfing movie that's ever been made! The inspiring true story gave me chills. Gerard Butler's performance was top notch and so was newcomer's Jonny Weston. A great movie for anyone, whether you've ever surfed or not.
B004LWZW7E|4.0|I don't think this movie has been done before, and you can't imgaine what people will do for more time. What I like about this movie is they are saying life is over at 25 which can't be farther from the truth considering what age does to your body..Bet you 50 years in a game of poker?
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|They have changed the James Bond character too much :-( I prefer the original (Sean Connery) and the ones with Pierce Brosnan.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Turned this on for the kids to watch and it's basically a love story between two teenage kids who are very different sort of like romeo and juliet.  The kids did like it!
B00B2V66VS|2.0|The game only plays for less then 5 minutes before it freezes.  Uninstalled and back to to the original game, which still works!
B001EN71CW|5.0|As a sci fi fan, I was completely taken with this series and enjoyed the film very much.  Film tied up some loose ends for us.  Even more of a fan now than I was before the fim.

B000002I4S|5.0|&#34;Naima' has accompaniment from Wynton Kelly on piano with Paul Chambers (bass) and Jimmy Cobb (on drums)<br /><br />I was recently looking up prominent East Coast hard bop pianist Wynton Kelly and I did not know that he had died in a Toronto hotel in 1971, I had arrived in Canada 1978.  Toronto has had its share of jazz clubs but nothing on the scene right now… though whenever a notable musician comes to town the tickets sell out fast!  The audience is here!  Anyway, I traced Wynton to the wonderful album by guitarist Wes Montgomery &#34;Full House&#34; with amazing solos from tenor man Johnny Griffin, and of course I recognised Wynton on piano with Paul Chambers (bass) and Jimmy Cobb (on drums) as I have the album.  My 1960s jazz friends and I quickly bought up that album in Yorkshire, northern England.  Then today I realised …  Wynton was also the pianist on Naima with John Coltrane, it was not Tommy Flanagan… with again Paul Chambers (bass) and Jimmy Cobb (drums)  I checked my album collection.  Sure enough, Wynton had performed the poignant and melodic piano solo on Naima, a composition from Coltrane's beautiful ballad mind.  Never mind &#34;hard bop&#34;,  &#34;Naima&#34; is a treasure of a ballad.  It has been frequently recorded and another version I like is by Carlos Santana / John McLaughlin on Love Devotion and Surrender.  Miles had high praise for John Coltrane, their &#34;Relaxin &#34;was my very first album and then I got the other three &#34;Cookin&#34; ( with tracks Airegin and My Funny Valentine )  &#34;Steamin&#34; and &#34;Cookin&#34;.  There were pianists Wynton Kelly, Red Garland, Tommy Flanagan of similar styling, somehow Hank Jones never played in the Miles Davis lineup to my knowledge.  The Davis Sextet with Bill Evans on piano was Kind of Blue, a jazz musicians vinyl or CD bible.  I also appreciated Milestones - Straight no chaser.  Miles eventually adopted the brilliant Wayne Shorter for his tenor player on the remarkable ESP album, as Coltrane had journeyed to a musical heaven in 1967.  Fortunately, I had just managed to catch him that year playing a final concert with Pharaoh Sanders in Tokyo, he was considered a god in Japan, as Coltrane had journeyed to a musical heaven in 1967.

B0087JTAKW|3.0|I have read &#34;Tuesdays with Morrie&#34; and &#34;have a little faith&#34; both written by Mitch Albom.  Both of those books were great books that I would recommend them to everyone to read, but &#34;the timekeeper&#34; was just okay and not necessarily worth reading.
B00A31UXLW|5.0|I loved this book.  I love this author.  I enjoyed it so much I couldn't put it down.  Harry Bosch is brilliant!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|One of my favorites. People say XFiles is better and this copies it, but NOT AT ALL. This show trumps XFiles! Fringe is easily my favorite show and I'm glad that Amazon provides it free for Prime-sters!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I love this show--it makes me laugh, smile and tear up on occasion. Its the best escapism in the world!
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|We thought it was pretty dumb really. I might have laughed twice during the whole movie. My 23 yr old daughter watched it as well (more her type of humor and so forth) and she also said &#34;It was pretty stupid&#34;.

B007THA4FI|1.0|Not good. I couldn't finish it. I would read and reread pages trying to figure out what I just read because my mind just wondered all the time. To many people for me to keep up with. Loved her Harry Potter series but not this one
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is so  am Amazing it's so EPIC you have to get this game if you have little memory left delete stuff for this s game!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Her writing makes me feel I am actually there. Love the book! Love all the books in this addicting series!
B008M721MS|1.0|without a doubt one of the most nickel&amp;dime app ever.the app came with my kindle fire so i set up an account and bought a monthly subscription for 3 dollars,however that doesnt include a number for your contacts to thats extra every month and texting cost extra credits that u have to of course buy. with out a doubt the worst 3dollars ive ever spent

B00BESCJII|5.0|This was an engaging and heart-warming story, but not sugary or predictable. I didn't have any expectations, but I really enjoyed it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game. Fun and addicting. Plus everyone is playing this game. Huge hit. Don't even bother looking at the reviews GET IT!!!!
B00005JMFQ|3.0|Cute and fun movie --- can watch this one over and over around the holidays if you have the time.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|We really like Denzel Washington movies, but this one was just &#34;okay&#34; to us.<br />The acting was excellent though, and John Goodman was great!
B007HACDLK|4.0|Vince Flynn does what Vince Flynn does best with this latest installment of the Mitch Rapp CIA assassin series. Mitch is like a precise weapon, only used by the U.S. spy agency when absolutely necessary. In this case, a top spy has gone missing. What he knows could sink intelligence collecting in the Middle East and set it back a decade. Lives would be lost, and careers terminated. But Mitch is injured relatively soon in the story. It's up to some of the other characters to pick up the pace and unravel the mystery and wade through the red tape and political opposition. Irene Kennedy dominates for much of the story. The novel's still fraught with strange grammatical errors. None is plural in this book. But I don't care. This is crack to a thriller reader.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I like getting information quickly.  By being selective in choosing apps. I can generally do this.  The format is concise and easy tonUse.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Lee Child starts his novels out fast. In this one Jack Reacher offers a random act of kindness and gets nabbed by a group of off-grid survivalists. There are a number of interesting twists and Jack and his obligatory hot babe get in one bind after another. Any other characters and they'd be toast. But Reacher proves he's not just another pretty face. Actually, pretty isn't the appropriate word. Just know that he'll eventually kick the ever-loving crap out of the bad guys.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This was a great read and I learned a lot about flowers and how they truly are special with special, deep rooted meanings.  Further, the sad story about the main character is realistic. She doesn't just trust anyone and her happy ending is more simplistic and challenging all at once.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I saw the movie with Tom Cruise. Didn't know what I was in for. I read the movie reviews about how he wasn't physically right for the character but pulled it off. Looked interesting. I left the theater thinking Phillip Marlowe from Raymond Chandler with a modern twist. Maybe a bit of Mike Hammer from Mickey Spillane and the dialogue of a Bogart film. So I picked up this book, the first in the Jack Reacher series, and plowed through it. Sure it's a little violent, but the character keeps it all in perspective. The bad guys deserve what they get. The hero is solid. He makes some mistakes but in general he kicks serious butt.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This book has it all: mystery, psychological intrigue, sexiness and surprise. You'll love the cast of characters and how they frustrate and entertain you all at once.
B002EXC5UY|5.0|This movie is pretty light and playful, but there is a great dark tinge to the humor. This is the second in the triptych with Pillow Talk and Send Me No Flowers. This is probably the most modern and daring of the 3, although all 3 are amazing. The idea of selling things that don't exist is so ahead of its time it's stupid.<br /><br />This time around, I was struck by many scenes that are both hilarious and epic, e.g. the shot of the billboard: 'V Day is Coming.' Simultaneously an announcement of the impending doom (time running out to make something) and the theft of the material from Day. [This film was 1962, Pynchon's V was written in '63, wonder if he was channeling this... ]<br /><br />Essential viewing. The writers of these films were geniuses.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I really like this game just wish I didn't have to connect to Facebook to get hearts. I am a grown-up and no I don't want to branch out to others.
B0083UWX04|5.0|Somehow I got Martha's recording of Prokofiev 3 when I was pretty young and fell in love with it (and her).<br /><br />What I didn't know until kind of recently is that she's a totally fascinating person who is very thoughtful and brilliant. I hate artists that have given no real thought to what their art is: both the aesthetics, and the process. This film shows that Argerich is the antithesis. Saw her perform the 3rd a few years ago in LA. Wow.<br /><br />Great film I will watch again and again..
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game so does my little sister. It's a great way to teach little kids how to take care of things like animals.
B0098QAAAC|1.0|It was hard for us to understand the dialogue and to relate to the characters.  We had the sense that the director was trying too hard to produce something original.
B008X9Z4I8|5.0|The Belkin Portfolio Sleeve Carrying Case for my Kindle Fire works just fine. Of course I didn't expect it not to meet my needs.
B00A6D5GBE|4.0|Downloaded this for myself, but, like most games I buy there are no instructions how to play. However, I handed it to my 5 and 6 year old grandsons and they knew exactly what to do!! Fun game for them. No guns, car wrecks or violence.
B009V3KKXY|2.0|Thank goodness for the authors you tube channel. I got this book to make bracelets with my nephew. I am not a novice at this stuff  as I have done a lot of macramé with my grandmother albeit many years ago. I thought with my former experience and his 11 year old nimble fingers we would be a great team. Nope just 4 hours of frustration. I finally found his you tube channel ( in the back listed with the resources)  then I was off to the races.  My nephew gave up on me and played a game of battle ship with his sister. LOL Hope this helps.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Great story lots of action and twists very cool. One of my favorite parts of this story is the scene at the Hubbles' house where Jack takes down 4 guys it's pretty intense.
B00007LTIG|4.0|Some standard blues numbers are everywhere in this album, I think the Dead's first. First bot and listened to it way back in 1968 while in high school. However, the real icing on the cake here is \\"Morning Dew\\", a really wonderful if simple tune, really drawn out here with by psychodelic guitars. Nifty arrangement! So a \\"4\\" for a few respectable blues/jugband rockers, and \\"Morning Dew\\"  is all all-time great, definitely my favorite Dead tune!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this game is really cool but is too much like the first one and I like the first one more
B0049OSQ18|5.0|Having heard a song or two on the Philly station 88.5, I thought I'd give this band a chance, and bought this CD. Most excellent! A dash of light anarchy, some worldly concerns, folk-rock, and country all thrown in. Must admit I like all the tunes, and often mention this band to those 1960's children (like myself) who often seem to think all today's pop music is some racket/ and/or rap.  The songs here all approach real musical art, are all originals (as far as I know), and the enclosed lyrics really help out, since many of the lyrics are most interesting. 2 favorites included ..Calamity Song..This is Why We fight...great songs for the new century, and I feel the same way about this eclectric band, which, yes does hark back to the best of the 60's, but also shows the way to the future (I hope!)
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I really enjoy the fact that Amazon Prime allows me to watch these shows when I miss them on TV.  The show has great quality on picture and sound!
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|The first 20- 30 min it's an edge of your seat thrill. The next hour was one bad judgement after another, including my decision to watch it to the end. Maybe worth a dollar at most.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I only have like a dollar left. so I cant by the full game. wish I could but I cant.lol. once I get that money I am buying this game.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I could not get in to this book at all. I don't think it's was meant for women over 30.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I enjoy sometimes too much. Should b doing other things and I stop for a quick game or two. Family loves to play too.
B00846F1YW|3.0|the first one had an annoying touch problem when you expanded the screen and then touched. to move around you toga red x and a few of those cost 20 seconds, this one has the same glitches and needs fixing so developers take note.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I personally love this game because I really suck at the original angry birds, but this version is totally different and it makes you think.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Harry Bosch is Harry Bosch and thankfully Mr. Connelly is smart enough not to allow him to become &#34;PC-ized&#34;. Not the greatest but still better than most cop fiction out there.

B000CNESU8|5.0|This film needed a special edition. The film itself is eerily prescient. Many of the issues that effect us today in terms of media presentation of the news are addressed and predicted in this film which was made eons before Ted Turner ever dreamed of CNN. The featurettes delve into the issues that Paddy Chayefsky raised.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have used this to access a few versions of the Bible successfully. I would recommend it to anyone that needs to look uo Bible verses.

B00A9C3RB8|3.0|We LOVE these two stars and we looked forward to this &#34;later life&#34; story. We were disappointed in the language...totally unnecessary...and the lack of good writing which could have made this story really a good one. The only reason it was worth watching were these two who could turn a bad script into a good one anyday! But kind of a flop in our opinion. Too bad.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|As ever this program exceeds all that you expect. It is even better than Upstairs Downstairs and I thought that was spectacular.
0670026603|5.0|Of all the books I would never have picked up....<br /><br />Our main character needs a job and so takes one caring for a former master of the universe turned paraplegic.  She then finds out that he wants to commit suicide and decides to try and change his mind.  All I can imagine with this scenario is cliche upon cliche.  Moyes navigates shockingly well.<br /><br />The book is sensitive, and really asks a lot of its characters.  They are so flawed but believable and doing their best.<br /><br />If you or anyone you love/know is physically challenged or could be one day (don't forget illness or old age), or is holding themselves back from life, read this book.<br /><br />Amazing job.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Gonna add this to my fifth grade reading list...mandatory.  I make it a point to only include exceptional books, and this fits the bill.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|This group is amazing! Brittany has a very unique voice and their sound surprises me for a band soo young. A mush have for any collection.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I like, not love most of  King's books, and love MOSt of the Dark Tower series.<br />I have read some of his books and actually wonderec whether or not he wrote them, or had a ghost writer and/or computer program spewing out words &#34;in the style of...&#34;, BUT not this book.<br />I think King';s at his best when he isn't writing horror, I.E. &#34;&#34;Picture of Rita Hayworth&#34;, etc.<br />The Only reason I gave this 4 out 5 stars is because it felt a bit too long, and needed an editor with a sharp blue pencil, BUT the story itself? Excellent. When King is in a groove with his writing, he's very, very good, and when he's bad, he's not really bad, just boring. There were parts of the book, as in when he's describing the influence the main character has on a student acting in a school play that he actually made me tear up, and that's pretty hard to do, and it ONLY happens when I get into a story enough that I totally suspend dis-belief and something happens that I can relate to wholeheartedly.<br />I read the story on someone else's Kindle so I didn't buy it at Amazon, but it was good enough that I will probably buy it anyway, so I can have it in my library, and read it again, like I have re-read &#34;The Stand&#34;, and the entire Dark Tower Series more than once.
B008V59AFW|5.0|This is such a big improvement in sound quality from the original issue. The live in Athens is a nice souvenir. Saw the So tour and the new tour too. Love to Peter Gabriel.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|I have recommended this series to everyone I know. It is fantastic! Very creative and action packed. Love, love, love it!
B009329ZF2|4.0|Not the best writing, no academy award material, but it's a good couple hours of action and fun. With aliens...and ships!
B004GHNIRK|1.0|Cannot even get into this book.  There is no point where it is even the least bit interesting.  Just awful.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I have been using dropbox for several months now and it has been great. I use it for documents, photos and even a few e-books. Highly recommended.
B009HSPODE|4.0|This is a lovely book and ideal for taking on holidays or when travelling.  The stories are short and pithy and hold your attention.  Alice Munro can be relied on to write well every time.

B009A3NGF4|4.0|Very solid and fun album.  IMO not as good as Sigh No More. Their are plenty of good tracks to make the purchase worthwhile.  If you enjoy the radio songs from the album you will enjoy owning the rest.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I flipping love this. its absolutely the best app on the market. I would absolutely positively reccomend to anyone I know!(;
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Don't be fooled - it's not really all about baseball - it's more about a father and daughter relationship.  Great actors and very entertaining.  I think you will enjoy this one.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|My family loved this movie. I hope Adam Sandler does more children's movies in the future!  My husband and I enjoyed it as much as the kids.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The series is amazing. I just loved every bit of all three. Please make your kids read the series before showing them the movie
B0085TKAW6|5.0|Always loved Ken Follett books.  Admire the way  he researches so well into whatever times he is writing about.  Y ou learn a lot while reading the stories behind t he times
B003O86FMW|5.0|The series is amazing. I just loved every bit of all three. Please make your kids read the series before showing them the movie
B000099T3P|3.0|This movie was a lot better to me when I was kid growing up in the 80s but as an adult, I didn't find it as entertaining.  In all honesty, I thought the plot was all over the place and there were too many loopholes as far as where the critters came from, why they escaped and why the bounty hunters would morph into anyone that they looked at too long.  Oh well, this was the 80s and not every movie was well-developed but this movie still offered decent entertainment, I think I've just outgrown it.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|I was completely into all three books. So good to find series books like this. I love the suspense and character development.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|George R. R. Martin continues his saga in this novel. On par with the rest of the books in the series.

B00932A3SK|4.0|Somewhat offbeat film from Norway. I enjoyed the cynical story of a hero (or anti-hero) who is cultered, self-confident, and able to overcome his lack of height by marrying a gorgeous blonde who is far taller than he is. The hero is a thief who steals art to support his rich life-style. When the hero meets another thief who is also ruthless, you begin to bond with the hero in his struggle to stay free and alive and out of prison. Will the hero be able to keep his gorgeous wife? Will he be able to overcome his ruthless adversary? Or will his luck run out, and he will be taken down by the law for his past crimes?<br /><br />Not a great film. But very enjoyable for its offbeat plot and characters. A solid B movie.<br /><br />Some people have complained about the movie's subtitles. But if you don't understand Norwegian (the language of the film), the subtitles are obviously helpful in understanding the plot. So get over it: subtitles are usually a better alternative to having a foreign movie dubbed into English.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I am an avid follower of DeMille and he did not let us down in his latest thriller. My busy schedule forces me to spread reading out over a lengthy period, but true to form I can pick up the book after 2 weeks and still have a vivid detail of everything that has happened in earlier stages of the book. That, to me,is the sign of a great author
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book couldn't put it down all most wanted to cheat and read the last chapter first you will enjoy reading this book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Amazing, all-consuming love story. Absolutely love it. Highly recommend. Definitely a book I could not put down. Even after completing the series, I keep coming back for more...
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I love this backpack and I would recommend it to anyone. That being said I am 6&#34;5 and am not a bean pole - I can get the mid section strap around me - but I wish it had an extra 4 inches. That is really my only complaint... well... that and the entire pack seams small when I wear it. The plus side to that is when I am hiking I am also not lugging this huge backpack that I really don't need to have all that space. It just looks funny on me because I am large and this pack on me seams small.<br /><br />The compartments inside can be adjusted to meet you size needs. The Quality of this backpack is excellent. I would buy it again and I highly recommend it for anyone... especially if your normal sized :)<br /><br />I can fit the T4 with a 300mm lens on the camera inside this backpack without taking the lens off.  And still have room for extra stuff.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Really enjoy this game, but think it's must be from England because of some of the words.  I don't know what they are.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I usually love Grisham, but this was not one of his best...hopefully the next one is better.  Don't really recommend it.
B00B5P37IG|2.0|I found the description misleading. This does not have any mainstream channels. If you are interested in Christian or foreign language channels, this is for you. Anyone else should take a pass.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Sorry to see that the role of Mathew will not be renewed.<br />Robert , in character will really miss him
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This book was very good and well worth reading.  It held my interest throughout.  Would recommend it to everyone and have done so.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Terrific acting,choreography,story lines, on location scenery<br /> The actors seem to really like each other in their respective role portrayals<br /> and the chemistry is excellent
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Love the game. My biggest problem is that it reset itself...twice...and I had so many points and things I won. That would be my biggest draw back.  I am unsure if that was a glitches in the game,  or in the kindle fire.
B003QSLW0K|5.0|The movie is very entertaining and different.  Kids and Adults would love it; it has good family values in the end and it's hilarious.
030716327X|5.0|Bought this for my first grandbaby. Had the same book when my kids were babies, brought back lots of great memories.Wish I had saved the original book instead of giving it away. The interactive aspects are wonderful...feeling dads scratchy beard ,patting the soft bunny fur,looking in mirror etc.. so sweet. Cant wait to read it to him. The stuffed bunny that comes with it is cute as well.. a good size for a first stuffed toy.
B0091LS07E|5.0|Alicia has a beutiful voice and piano playing ability it is amasing.  And you add song writing to the equation it is just wonderful to listen to her.
B001L83PLQ|5.0|what i appreciated most of all was the pace of the book. the slow decent into war and the evolution or destruction of the human soul and spirit. it's not a particularly happy book but it's a good one.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|This is an &#34;okay&#34; Western film about British expats retiring at a run down hotel in India. For the person who daydreams about world travel it will certainly seem exotic. But for those of us who really live outside of the West, it is a bit passe - but no more so than Dev Patel's other cliche-ridden flick &#34;Slumdog Millionaire.&#34; (Which, again, isn't an Indian movie - but merely a British movie ABOUT India - and from an outsider's perspective at that.) . . . It's nice that non-Indians who made and watch this film seem to like India. That's why I don't rate it any lower. It's not a pukka Indian movie, however, which is why I don't rate it any higher. . . . It's just okay in my book.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I paid $10.00 for this book!!!  This book is awful!!!  I didnt even finish the book. So glad I waited before buying book 2 and 3!!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I saw the movie first, then decided to read the book.  Even thought the movie was one of the best movies I have ever seen, the book was much better.  Loved it!
B000001G5L|5.0|I'm not usually a fan of Karajan, but I particularly like this album that is very well recorded. Yes, the tempo may be slower than usual, but it does not destroy the music of Beethoven, that is beautiful on this recording. I personally think this album is the best version of this concerto, but if you want an interpretation with a tempo closer to \\"normal\\", I strongly suggest the version of Schneiderhan/Jochum which is available on amazon, and is also highly recommendable.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I love all Reacher books.  However, I am skeptical that short little Tom Cruise can play the giant Reacher. If he pulls it off, It took some skill; I&#34;m pretty sure the movie won't measure up.  We'll see, won't we.
B0006PV5VC|5.0|If you like Scheherazade, you must have this album. The performance is thrilling and the sound is unbeatable. For me, this is probably one of the best classical album I bought so far. Do not miss this recording.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just love this series!!  Maggie Smith is priceless and has such good lines.  Very well done show with great characters!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It really suprised me with the character and plot development.  The book definately progress very well.  A great read and a bargain.

0930289455|5.0|Sympathy for The Joker.<br /><br />What can i say about this extraordinary story that hasn't been said already in the other hundreds upon hundreds of reviews it has ever received...<br /><br />I think it's all been covered, but maybe you've somehow found yourself here despite having never read this story, or maybe you have read it and you just are curious for another opinion of it, well, then, I freely assess... (in what will probably be my longest review, ever).<br /><br />Undoubtedly, there are a few different schools of thought about *exactly* why The Killing Joke is so amazing. That it's one of the most astounding accounts of origins is a major discernment. Though for me personally, it's always been about so much more than just a story of origins, not to diminish that particular significance in anyway whatsoever, especially for Barbara Gordon.<br /><br />Joker's backstory as told by Alan Moore is hands-down one of his finest works and one of the biggest impact's a one-shot has ever had on the DC Universe.<br /><br />I first read this when I was 12, and talk about a psychological drama that unleashed the nihilism!<br /><br />Here we have one of the most classic battles between Batman and the Joker, two iconic characters apparently at complete polar opposites.<br /><br />But aren't these two determined characters actually strangely similar? One day a little rich boy had a bad day, it turned him into a sociopathic hero. One day an unnamed struggling engineer (if that's what you believe, though the truth doesn't really matter) had a bad day, it turned him into a psychopathic villain.<br /><br />But is Joker's ambition swelled from revenge? Is he really inflicting sadistic cruelties mindlessly? Does he even ever want to hurt Batman? If you think Joker even has no motivation, you should reconsider.<br /><br />The focus of this, albeit popular but controversial, school of thought is that \\"one bad day\\" isn't about what defines a hero or villain but instead how you deal with it.<br /><br />And in the intimacy of profound moments and paths presented in this story we meet the Joker meeting himself.<br /><br />The Joker who is all about making points, and really thats it. Everything else is just unhealthy by-products of that singular insight, intrusive to the world as they may be.<br /><br />\\"Just one bad day. You had a bad day once. Am I right?\\" The Joker at one time says to Batman remarking on their likeness.<br /><br />\\"I can tell. You had a bad day and everything changed. Why else would you dress up like a flying rat?\\"<br /><br />And yes, at the end of the day, these two people have both accepted their aberrances, as well as their psychological disfigurements.<br /><br />Personalities forged by traumatic events and both living on society's fringes, each trying to cope with their own inner demons.<br /><br />So here I propose that the words hero and villain are entirely subjective. It's all about perspective. That was one of Moore's primary assertions.<br /><br />So, what do you do with your tragic? Once it's there, how do you make the most of the experience? If one considers the Joker's motivations for trying to drive Commissioner Gordon insane not sadistic so much as it is to underline one simple point, then perhaps it is not so unreasonable to see that Batman and Joker can be at once completely at odds and yet parallel, because yes, they can both attest that anyone no matter how decent or unadulterated can lose one's rationality due to \\"one bad day\\". Though whether Batman will ever honestly admit that, well... that's really one of the cruxes of it all, isn't it.<br /><br />Alan Moore delivered a brilliant story with elegance. I mean, there isn't a wasted line. The concepts to explore could occupy you for unknown lengths of time if you allowed for that. I've read this story many times over since that first breathtaking time and still find it impressive and intense.<br /><br />Moore's Joker wants to make the world and Batman understand the personal value of experience. So then now, with this presentation is a new shed light on the psychology of the Joker. I had to ask myself with all of Joker's effort to make a point, was Batman ever making a difference or just making a point himself?<br /><br />TKJ was one of my first experiences with the Batman mythos and will always be one of my most favourite Batman stories, capturing and reflecting the idea that indeed there are fine lines between reason and madness, but most importantly, whether you're making a point or making a difference, right or wrong, it doesn't matter if it's worth making, maybe it's all in the delivery.<br /><br />And going further, another notion I developed at some point after being exposed and being open to ideas presented within this compelling story, an abstraction some may call it, about Joker's complexity, which may not be so complex after all, is that now I tend to think that maybe wrong is what keeps you from going over the edge when madness pulls on you hard, trying to keep you in its place. That what it comes down to is, when right takes away everything you ever had, then maybe wrong can save you. Well, I suppose that could just be my own personal manifesto inadvertently surmised. This story, man, it does offer up so many dynamics with which to run with. Don't know if that was ever suggested, but I can see that being relevant to Joker's persona and I often explore that concept a lot in my head. I think Brian Azzarello's Joker is a good example of that conjecture embraced, but I digress.<br /><br />Anyway, one of the other things I especially loved about TKJ is Brian Bolland's artwork.

So then now, with this presentation is a new shed light on the psychology of the Joker. I had to ask myself with all of Joker's effort to make a point, was Batman ever making a difference or just making a point himself?<br /><br />TKJ was one of my first experiences with the Batman mythos and will always be one of my most favourite Batman stories, capturing and reflecting the idea that indeed there are fine lines between reason and madness, but most importantly, whether you're making a point or making a difference, right or wrong, it doesn't matter if it's worth making, maybe it's all in the delivery.<br /><br />And going further, another notion I developed at some point after being exposed and being open to ideas presented within this compelling story, an abstraction some may call it, about Joker's complexity, which may not be so complex after all, is that now I tend to think that maybe wrong is what keeps you from going over the edge when madness pulls on you hard, trying to keep you in its place. That what it comes down to is, when right takes away everything you ever had, then maybe wrong can save you. Well, I suppose that could just be my own personal manifesto inadvertently surmised. This story, man, it does offer up so many dynamics with which to run with. Don't know if that was ever suggested, but I can see that being relevant to Joker's persona and I often explore that concept a lot in my head. I think Brian Azzarello's Joker is a good example of that conjecture embraced, but I digress.<br /><br />Anyway, one of the other things I especially loved about TKJ is Brian Bolland's artwork. It's intensely clean and alive. And if you've never seen Bolland's original inks for this story, done in frakking brush... Fraakkk.

B003O86FMW|4.0|I guess it was pretty good, could be better, but good. I admit it wasn't as good as the first book, but overall good. I honestly didn't like it when history repeated itself, I found it rather plain, but the book itself is pretty good. And I've forgiven it because of the epic cliffhanger, so yeah. It was pretty good.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I've tried other games like this and none have looked so real. I love how you interact with your horse and the graphics are awesome. Just wish I got gems faster!
0385535147|5.0|I was looking forward to reading this, & when I found it on Amazon for such a reasonable price, I knew I had to get it. So happy I did! Thank you!
B005LJKEXS|5.0|I made this purchase to run a webcam into another room. I do a lot of live streaming and was looking for a way to have a camera setup in another room without having to go wireless. This cable was an extremely cheap and efficient solution. So far I have only tested it for about an hour but everything worked flawlessly. The real test will come later when I have a 12 hour stream. I didn't notice a loss in quality at all on the cam and there were no lost frames (that I could tell by looking) over the long cable. I would highly recommend this if you need to run a USB powered device at a distance.
B009K0P10K|3.0|Good Lord...let's get this over with!  Poor Girl!  Move on to something more positive, please.  There's far too much &#34;sleeping around&#34; for me to continue enjoying  the show.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|really like playing this game allows you to use ur mind and it is very addictive. I play all day long
B008ASGP3U|4.0|I love Scotland and the work of Scottish author Ian Rankin, and I've now read every novel in his Detective Inspector John Rebus series. Rebus retired from the force in &#34;Exit Music&#34; with little passion for anything but locking up criminals and immersing himself in vintage rock music. In this newest book, set in Edinburgh and the Inverness area, the canny, cranky retiree (also a heavy drinker and smoker), has managed to return to work in a cop shop as a sort of civilian temp in a cold-case unit where some view him as too old and out of touch with modern law enforcement techniques and bureaucratic procedure to be useful. But when one of the cold cases seems to be linked to new murders, an inspired Rebus finagles his way into working with--and around--his former colleagues to catch the killer, leaving flummoxed and furious higher-ups in his wake. There's no one like Rebus. I'm so glad he's back.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|What can I add that's not been said thousands of times before? This series has totally blown me away. I'm afraid to start books 4 and 5 because of the negative reviews, but the first 3 are so amazing, I MUST KNOW what's next!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I felt like I was relearning all that I had forgotten about the history of this time and what an enjoyable way to learn.  Makes you realize how easily your freedom could be taken from you.  Scary, actually.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I'm having eye issues, and the you version reader is really a big help. Also love all the versions available!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|A quick read with an interesting twist. I read it in two nights and enjoyed it very much. I found the language a challenge to follow, but it is true to the location.
B005HSL626|4.0|Fun game, addictive, better backgrounds would be nice like japan theme, new york, or Hawaii otherwise simple and fun. Maybe to you can and some fruit stealing monkeys or something.
1401324649|4.0|this book was a treat to read from beginning to end.  The two lifetimes parralel and the charachters made this very enjoyable.
B004K58GSO|5.0|Robert Mitchum,John Wayne, and James Caan together in action packed western. Similar to Rio Bravo but it stands on its own. A must add to your collection.

B004GHNIRK|1.0|This book was a hard to follow book. I personally would not recommend it. However, I have heard the movie is wonderful.
B005EHILV4|3.0|Works Great But, documentation is seriously lacking. I guess it's out on their website and FAQ's but when I spend over $50 you should include it for crying out loud.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Interesting to say the least. Tastefully done and bit to wordy. Will read all three books. Hope it continues to keep my interest.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|Literally in my own top 5 movies. Cute & funny for all ages. We can't wait for the DVD release!  It'll be one of the few we would actually want to purchase!
030758836X|4.0|just when I thought it was getting too predictable and boring, up pops another twist which makes you read on to the finish line.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This is a very nice cover for my fire hd.  I like the way it feels in my hands.  Very luxurious feel to my.  I would definitely buy it again.
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|Kate Winslet & Ralph Fineses were excellnt in this film.  The story touchs on somemany levels you are not aware of most of the levels until the end of the film.  The main story of the SS Prison Guard in WWII (Kate Winslet), the teen age boy who becomes her lover, the man who is an attorney who sees the war crimes trial of the Prison Guard, the women in his life, and what it was like in post war Germany in the late 1940's, 1950' and even into the 1960's.  The actors were outstanding!  A MUST SEE film!!
B000SGSU58|4.0|I like the Harry Bosch Novels and am reading them in order. He is becoming quite a character.  I look forward to the next one.
B000CCBCAS|4.0|This is very good DVD.  I am a fan of Hugh Grant of English films.... Notting Hill, Sense Senseablity, etc. Well done!!
B000FC1MM8|5.0|I like the Harry Bosch Novels and am reading them in order. He is becoming quite a character.  I look forward to the next one.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|The most well thought out hidden objects! Some games become tedious, but I welcomed each challenge! Interesting graphics, easy to follow story line! Wish it had been longer!!!
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I heard rave reviews about this, but couldn't get into it that much myself.  Denzel Washington seems to just be himself, the same guy he is in every movie, which is fine, but doesn't really pull me into the character he is supposed to portray.  John Goodman's goofy cameos are entertaining but distracting and overall it feels like a very serious and deep story that is obscured by some hollywood nonsense.
1451695195|5.0|I would definitely recommend this book to everyone.  It is very interesting and well written.  You cannot put this book down.
B003EVWDR0|5.0|a beautiful movie with amazing scenery and action.  This film is just plain fun to watch.  There's so much going on you are in overload trying to take it all in.  Definitely watch on a big screen in HD with surround sound.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I really enjoy computer Mahjong...my RazrM screen is a little small and enlarging loses some of the tiles. It's a good distraction while in a waiting room.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I started reading this book about a week before Mr. Kyle's trajic death. I was captivated by this mans sacrifices and experiences in serving our country. This is a must read for any patriot!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|As an Eastern Long Islander...I've been glued to this app since I got it. It's been a crazy Winter so far and I love the Alerts and Forecasts.
B00BESM14U|5.0|I loved it. I want to read the book now. I have nothing negative to say about this movie. Thanks.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|This show is full of supense and very emotional. I found myself always wondering what happens next.I watch it over and over .
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|It was a little slow to start, but good movie.It is a movie my husband will watch over and over. A little gruesome at times.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Excelent book full of jaw dropping twists engaging the reader in every single one of them. However the feeling left at the end in me, just stole that last star. As a work of literature due to its simplicity, how engaging it was, and the development of the different characters and narrative it deserves 5 stars. As a personal opinion and due to my own experience I had to give 4 stars as I currently feel impotent.<br />Excellent!!!!
B000SEIK2S|4.0|Excellent military scifi.  A great tribute to Starship Troopers and the pace of the story keeps the reader engaged.  Scalzi includes a great insight to the science of science fiction to give the story depth and backgounnd.  If you are a military science fiction fan you wont be disappointed.
B0017QSZW6|5.0|The acting, the costumes, the sets are all amazing. I am a historian specializing in  Tudor England and everything was extremely accurate.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|The title says it all.  This is not a Bond movie.  It is just an action movie that is based in Britain.  I miss the smarts that were the typical Bond movie and all of the toys.  This just wasn't what I wanted from a Bond film.
B006LRUVUA|4.0|It is a good app. I use it everyday. You should get it. It lets you connect to your mac ,pc,labtop and desktop!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Bought this for the grandkids to watch during our Academy Awards dinner. The theme  was  &#34;Les Miserables&#34; so it tied in perfectly with the french motif. The kids loved it.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This is a quick easy read, I read it in one day. It was cute. what started out as a dare,ended up as a successful marriage. I also think her &#34;Friends&#34; were not friends at all!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is both an excellent court room drama with a some mystery mixed in and an excellent depiction of family love and loss.  The protagonists are well-drawn and believable, loving and likeable.  The format switchs back and forth in time, not enough to be confusing, but just enough to be interesting.  And, there's a nice twist at the end.  This was one of the most enjoyable reads I've had in awhile & I'm recommending it to all my friends.
B0063GORYU|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT GAME, SOMETIMES I WIN AND SOMETIME I LOOSE BUT I KEEP ON GOING.WOULD TELL ALL MY FRIENDS TO GIVE IT A TRY.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this app.  it's addictive, it was free for me but would pay for it. give it a try. hours of fun
B0063IH60K|5.0|SOLITAIRE  IS THE BEST , I LOVE PLAYING  IT.  I HAVE FRIENDS THAT ALSO PLAY SOLITAIRE EVERYDAY. I HAVE TAUGHT MY GRANDDAUTHERS THE GAME.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book really teaches you how to be a better spouse.  I recommend it even if you're not having marital issues.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Other CEOs may do it differently than Steve Jobs did, but the author seemed to capture the essence of what drove Jobs to be the perfectionist that he was. If you weren't among the best of the best it would have been brutal to work for/with Jobs. And in that regard he probably drove away people who could have made his products even better. But it was fascinating to see how his narrow focus of concentrating on a very few products led to such great results. If you know what you are and concentrate on that rather than try to be something you aren't greatness can ensue.
B0094KT8W8|5.0|I have seen this movie more than ten times already and all I can say is wow its really really good. Good effects and sound effects, story, etc...
B003KJF2WE|4.0|I liked this movie.  The story made sense and the acting by Edward Norton and Liv Tyler made the characters believable.<br />The action is impressive of course, and I think a wide range of people would enjoy the film.  There is not a lot of bad language and other than the use of a lot of machine guns it's pretty family friendly.
B003VSVWA0|5.0|Captures the live performance of a master in seduction. A must for any fan , this has to be in your collection.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|fast moving and active.  Keeps player on their toes and ready for surprises. time flies when you play. Very quick tochange direstions and graphics are good.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really like this Temple Run 2 it's really better than the first one with much more exciting and adventurous obstacles. I'm like a little kid just wanting to play it all day. Great for all kids!
B0058EBNAO|4.0|Of the 30 or so apps on my Kindle Fire, this is one of the top 2 or 3 I use most often. How can you go wrong with all that info for such short money ... And earthquakes too!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Marvelous series bringing back high moral standards, elegance and beauty: hard to find in the world of video today.  Masterpiece Theater is of the highest quality.
B001VIMCW4|5.0|Who could not love Daniel Craig as James Bond? He is a totally different Bond than the one I grew up with, but much more in line with the times. He plays this role wonderfully. It is nice also to have him work with a woman without treating her as an object.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|Mr. Sanderson is to be commended for his ability to construct a highly believable &#34;world&#34; peopled with compelling personalities that have totally believable interantion and a gripping story.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The first two seasons were delightful but somewhat predictable - the characters were engaging but rather one-dimensional. Season 3 has some shockers that are making the show more exciting, though not all of the shocks are welcome ones! Regardless, this season has caught my attention more and will keep me on the edge of my seat much more than the previous ones, while continuing to provide the fascinating peek inside a lifestyle that is totally foreign to 99.9% of the world.
B007ONSLLQ|4.0|The vocals are superb! Lzzy packs quite a punch in her voice and it shows in every song. The music is good, but not great, to my taste. The only thing I would improve on is the music. I would make it play a bigger part in the overall picture. Add more melody to it and more instruments. And, I really dislike the explicit lyrics. But, that's just me.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Action and suspense packed.  Just the way I would be if one of my kids was taken!  Liam is awesome.
B0026PA05M|4.0|The vocals are superb! Lzzy packs quite a punch in her voice and it shows in every song. The music is good, but not great, to my taste. The only thing I would improve on is the music. I would make it play a bigger part in the overall picture. Add more melody to it and more instruments. But, that's just me.
B0095P3ULC|2.0|Two of these movies was plenty. The hot girl was so ridiculously hot as to be unbelievable and not in a good way.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|Back in the day, I fell in love with SciFi through the original Star Trek series, and have been a fan of the Trek movies and spin-offs. I was unable to watch this particular series on TV (pre DVR world).  I am now loving the story of the earliest days of boldly going where no one has gone before.  My amazon prime membership allows me to watch the episodes as I have time.  There are other Trek series that I was unable to watch in their entirety when they were aired, and look forward to filling-in the blanks through the amazon video library.  Enterprise is worth any trekkie's time.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|The working man's Bond. My wife thinks that he is not Suave enough. She prefers Connery. I however like them both equally well. But, for action's sake... well you just can't beat Daniel Craig's character in this installment's rendition. And now, a new &#34;Q&#34; and a new &#34;M&#34;; Fifty more years of BOND!!!<br />I give it 6 Stars.<br />Loved it!
B008Y73940|4.0|I thought that this movie would not be one that I would like.  It started kind of slow I thought.  But stick with it.......it gets quite interesting and there are many surprises and turns in the story and it left me breathless at the end.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I like to play this game of Mahjong.  It's relaxing and fun. Would recommend just to pass the time away
B000PY6BBI|5.0|This was our movie choice for Valentine's Day, and it had just the right amount of humor and romance for us.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Well, i cannot really recommend this book to anyone over 18 or any men.<br /><br />As a man i find the lead character's indecision infuriating.....women in my office tell me its wonderful, emotional and realistic, but for me, no, just maddening.<br /><br />Nothing much happens.<br /><br />Boring.<br /><br />Not sexy at all.<br /><br />and the author keeps using &#34;oh my&#34; in italics as a descrption of getting aroused. ok the first time, or the second time, but by the sixteenth time it's too much.<br /><br />No....plenty of better books to choose.<br /><br />Like the DaVinci Code, sometimes a best seller just doesnt deserve to be.
B009JZPH32|5.0|Great movie, all characters were cast perfectly!<br />I would highly recommend to anyone over 18,<br />Would be a good movie to watch with your significant other!
1439153663|4.0|This was recommended to me by a friend, and I've read it a second time for a book discussion.  It's hard to put down.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Streamed this via a Vizio blu ray player. Amazon zervice is excellent and this is the best super hero movie yet. Well worth renting!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|GRAT READ. I LOVE THE JOHN COREY SERIES, NEED MORE OF HIM. I WISH MR. DEMILLE WOULD NEGOTIATE WITH SOME MOVIE COMPANY TO DO A MOVIE OR MOVIES ON THE JOHN COREY SERIES. MAYBE A TV SERIES.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|If you like action and spy mysteries this is a must read.  Non stop action one of those rare hard to put down. Cannot wait for next in the series of RYAN.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|best upgrade tree ever. adds levels in a tower defense game. finally out on kindle fire. loved it on computer now I can take it where ever I go
B006OCM0G0|5.0|A free,fun game to play cooking different foods and visiting other restaurants. I definitely recommend this game for anyone wanting to create food and design a restaurant.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Page turner. You have to stay on it. Could of had a better ending. Good story. Easy to follow. Reminds me of \\"Wild things\\".
B0099Y2YL6|4.0|Although Downton Abbey is fascinating and compelling, I take issue with the handling of several characters, and serious issue with the death of several major characters, especially Matthew in the end of the season episode. His death is abrupt, senseless, and gratuitous to the extent of being manipulative of the audience's emotions. This manipulation is clearly the writer's objective, but I found it to be obvious in a generally subtle show and annoying. In my view, manipulation of the audience's emotions to this extent reduces the show somewhat to an extremely classy soap opera.<br /><br />The first Mrs. Bates' character made no sense. Mr. Bates went to prison to cover for her. All right, why? What was her offense? Did he love her and then hate her? For no apparent reason? Her character was rotten to the extent of being primitive. No suicide for the purpose of blaming the spouse and causing the husband's execution makes sense whatsoever.<br /><br />Lady Edith's being jilted at the altar by Sir Anthony was ludicrous and totally non-credible, especially as we were led to believe he loved her.<br /><br />The soldier Patrick, whose face was mutilated and claimed to be the heir of the family's estate, was handled with crudity and disappeared just when he was becoming interesting and sympathetic in the extreme. This was not explained. It was therefore not remotely credible. A terrific story line was lost, actually thrown away when the young soldier was dismissed so cruelly, especially by the Earl, leading us to suspect him of selfish motives. This was confusing, as Patrick's assumed death on the Titanic was viewed as a tragedy by the family and led to the succession problem which occupied most of the miniseries.<br /><br />The interweaving of the many characters is admirably done in general, but should have been done so much more carefully in some cases.<br /><br />I couldn't believe for a moment the sudden death of the young Turkish diplomat in Mary's bed. Another gratuitous event that strained my credibility to the utmost.<br /><br />The writing is not weak. On the contrary. The writing is so strong and the story so compelling that I was severely disappointed by the above mentioned events. I don't like to be manipulated, especially when I'm otherwise enjoying the show immensely.
B003Z49LYO|4.0|Filmed beautifully and the writing was wonderful.  This twisted tale was wonderful to watch during a blizzard!  I would recomend
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Man talk about easier. I am not a writer but useing notebook made it easier to keep a journal. And to save it to Pdt so I can transfer it to my computer and print it or email a letter. Wow so many usefullness in this app.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I laughed, cried, smiled, got angry, I lived life through this book. I felt like I was a friend of Katies and Alex's and the kids. I haven't been this emotionally invested in a book in a long time. Outstanding, with an ending that makes me feel like I can go to bed happy.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It was a good book but a little on the boring side. As a conclusion to the series it was OK but I feel it could have been better. I hope they do better in the last movie.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|I love this movie to death! This is absolutely one of my all time favorite movies! It is a must see!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This program is great to watch.  The relationship between brothers is very interesting and their adventures together make it fun.  I enjoy the humor that happens once in a while in the episodes and look forward to the next chapter at the end of each episode.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the best game ive ever played and I love minecraft<br /> and this game is awesome and if. you don't like it don't play it
B008YCMM2A|5.0|1969 Lost Band's acts registered in Jon Lohmann's discography had been thoroughly dug out by bootleggers. In that sense, these materials are not new to elite collectors. Columbia/Legacy selected concerts which already had good reputation in performance and sound quality for this set, resultantly bracketed the Bitches Brew sessions. Set list here suggest Miles was using his concert to break in new materials while improving band's skill by playing songs well known to audience. Miles is definitely dominating the band. Spontaneous stop and go gives contrasted dynamics to continuous hour long suites. Well-known compositions reduced to melodic hooks provides maximum improvisation space in the tune. Most of titles are overlapped. But, because of the band's various untiring approach, they are heard anew each time.<br /><br />As to Juan-les-Pins concerts, I give a decision in favor of the second night. There is some slacken parts in the first night. The second night is much more energetic, aggressive and innovative. DVD quality is wonderful. It would be glad tidings to those in anguish over poor quality DVD in the market.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think it's cool.  a lot better than the first. there are some changes that could be made, so change them.
B001DF68MA|5.0|This is a great product. It took a little fiddling to install on my Kona Dawg 2008 as there was very little room to connect beneath the steering, but it has been well worth the effort. Great to have the little guy in front of you on a ride as you can talk them through everything you are seeing together. The padding on the front appendage is so comfy he has fallen asleep several times at the end of longer rides. Everyone marvels at the design and i have lost count of the number of people asking where I got it. I couldn't recommend it with any more enthusiasm. Half the price of Australian retailers, when buying through Amazon (inc shipping!). Just get it if you're thinking about it, you won't be disappointed.

0470901071|3.0|The information is presented unevenly with doses of intuitive and non-intuitive organization.<br /><br />The author takes an overly familiar tone with the reader, using silly analogies instead of concise descriptions and oftentime using silly jokes and irrelevant observations which is really distracting.<br /><br />It wouldn't be a problem except for the uneven organization and information coverage as well as summary and review questions.<br /><br />Examples:<br /><br />Chapter 3, Review Question 1: \\"What must happen if a DHCP IP conflict issue occurs?\\"<br />Listed answer: C: The administrator must fix the conflict by hand at the DHCP server.<br /><br />That is incorrect. It is not required for the administrator to take action here for the conflict to be resolved. It is only required for him to take action if he wishes to release the conflicted IP address into the DHCP pool again. The word \\"must\\" is extremely misleading and can result in incorrect answers. Stuff like this could be overlooked, except specific word meaning is apparently supremely important to the author, as in the following example:<br /><br />Chapter 3, Review Question 5: \\"Which of the following are layers in the TCP/IP model? (Choose three).<br />Listed answer: A, C, & D: The Application, Transport and Internet layers.\\"<br /><br />This is at best misleading, more likely just plain wrong. First there is no such thing as the TCP/IP model. There is a DoD model and an OSI model. Next, none of the listed answers are layers in the DoD model except for Internet layer.<br /><br />Here's what I mean about specific word meaning being so important. Read the author's explanation:<br />\\"A,C,D. This seems like a hard question at first because it doesn't make sense. The listed answers are from the OSI model and the question asked about the TCP/IP protocol stack (DoD model). However, let's just look for what is wrong. First the Session layer is not in the TCP/IP model; neither are the Data Link and Physical layers.This leaves us with the Transport layer (Hot to Host in the DoD model), Internet layer (Network layer in the OSI), and Application layer (Application/Process in the DoD).\\"<br /><br />The above is a direct quote from the author and is borderline retarded.<br /><br />1) The question didn't ask about the TCP/IP protocol stack, it asked about the (non-existent) TCP/IP model.<br />2) Why is it ok to summarize Application, Presentation and Session into Application but it isn't ok to summarize Data Link and Physical into (either) Data Link or Physical?<br />3) (Most important), why is the author trying to trick us with nonsensical questions instead of review questions designed to test our knowledge of Cisco networks?<br /><br />Based on repeated exposure to poor review questions and uneven quality of information presentation, I cannot recommend this book.<br /><br />Update: on a continued read (I really hoped I just had a bad evening or two) I still have to support my rough review. More examples (SNMP is introduced as being UDP in versions 1 and 2 but as TCP or UDP in version 3, yet review questions ask you to classify if it is UDP or TCP and the answer is UDP - this is just discouraging for folks trying to prepare). I've read some of the other negative reviews of this book and find myself on the same page with them. This will be the first technical book I've had to return to Amazon because it just isn't useful.
B009R5GR1K|2.0|I got the free app but the keyboard was unreliable and wouldn't come up when needed. I went ahead and bought the upgraded version and the keyboard did work better, but my favorite of the word games, Words Within Words, just disappeared from the app. No explanation, no word at all. I would think I dreamed it, but there it is on the free version, but the damn keyboard still won't come up. So even with two versions of this app, I can't play my favorite word game.<br />Then try to send feedback from the website! Won't work. Every time you enter in the code thing \\"to prevent abuse\\" the app cuts off the last letter you entered and then says your code doesn't match! Try it, I challenge you!<br />I thought this would be my favorite app, as I love to learn and collect words. So far, however, it has been an exercise in frustration.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I have so enjoyed this game. It love this story that goes along with the game as well. It is well worth the money..
B007V65R54|4.0|Excellent discussion of the topic, but it would have benefitted by some more concrete and worked out examples of probability predictions using the Bayesian approach.
B00BESCJII|4.0|I like this movie, read the book years ago and was excited for the movie to come out. It had  ups and downs and shows all forms of emotions. Recommend watch. (And read)
B004T4KQJS|5.0|Krauss presents a great summary of the Standard Model and it's predictions, verifictaion, and implications for the universe and its inhabitants.  Ricjhard Dawkinf delivers a great summary in his afterword..
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this game, I keep looking to see how many coins I have! Love playing it, tho it seems pointless. It is fun!
B004B4V19K|5.0|An excellent series with accurate historical events. Sledge can't wait to do his part for the war effort and ultimately experiences the true cost of war, the loss of his humanity. Some people have said that it is hard to follow the series because the 1st Marine Div. moves around so much, hence the term \\"island hopping campaign\\".  But that is exactly what they did in reality.  They are our greatest generation.  If you ever meet a vet, shake their hand and thank them.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Was a strangely engaging story.  A real insider view of mental ill health.<br />I look forward to seeing the movie.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is a talented author. I read books for young adults  because my librarianmentioned to me that they have more magic.  I read &#34;Looking for Alaska&#34; and was impressed with Mr. Green's use of language and the visual power in it's effect.  The capacity to create visuals usually sinks me into a book; I lose track of time; hate the pleasure to end.  The magic is in Green's wordcraft, certainly not the themes of life.  The stories are real.  Very real, with character construction that is genius full of emotional truth.  The stories hold suspense.  I would recommend &#34;The Fault in Our Stars&#34;  to anyone who loves to read, see, and cry...
B003LSTK8G|5.0|First book to explain in plain language the subprime mortgage crisis, seen from different angles: consumers, investment banks, money managers, insurers, government.<br />First book that tell us who were these guys and how their thinking evolved in leading the country into the worst economic crisis after the Great Depression.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Yes, you heard me... Temple Rump. This time Imagani Studios downgraded from the original game. The sensitivity is horrible, and bad camera angle makes this game despicable. The power ups are way too confusing, especially the gems. The change to one giant evil demon monkey was if anything more annoying. You can barely see where you are going, and why are there less characters! I am still disappointed that there is only one world to run in. On the bright side the game is still ad-free, more locations and obstacles. Overall, not as good as Temple Run 1, but still will give you some entertainment.
B004HD61KE|2.0|Too much about Mormonism for this Christian.  Story could have been told without so much about the indians and Mormonism.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Can't wait for the next one. When is the next one to be released. Looking forward to the next read.
1401310672|5.0|The title says it all!! VERY funny!!! I always check what I have written when I text cuz<br />Autocorrect will get you every time!!! LOL!!!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is so addicting! The more you play the faster you get and I like the variety of shapes and colors. Similar colors can confuse you which makes it fun.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Boring certainly not a THRILLER  , I would not recommend, forget the hype, kept waiting for the thrill to begin...never happened!
B002VWNIDG|5.0|one of my favorite movies of all times! All times classic and everyone needs to see it.  I can watch it endlessly.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|Five minutes into the movie I was wishing I could get my money back. The first scene was embarrassing to watch and shocking in the nudity. No comment on the story line because I did not watch the rest of the movie.
1616550414|5.0|for all Zelda fans, this is a MUST have.  It gives so many details about Zelda in general and the games and concepts and explains how each game was developed.  A master piece!!!
1400032717|4.0|It was an interesting read. Certain situations were confusing (given the narrator's circumstances), but the overall storyline kept me wanting to know more.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Simple fun, a bit addictive. Very easy to play on a tablet. Definitely worth the free download. Better than regular solitaire.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|I love this recording by the Black Keys!  It's a great recording to work out too!  I've never been dissapointed by any of the Black Keys Music!
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved all three books! I couldn't put the iPad down to stop reading haha.<br /><br />What I loved most about these books is the storyline. I love Ana, my favorite character by far! I hope he writes more books I would like to know what happens to them!!<br /><br />I didn't like that some scenarios felt a little dragged out, but that's just me.<br /><br />I'd recommend these books to anyone who enjoys a little BDSM erotica love story.
B007B6VOG0|4.0|Great music just really don't care for the foul language.  Aside from that great songs!  They played well on the grammys!
B007V5CF5K|4.0|Enjoyed playing the game. It take a while to download, so do that when you aren't planning on using your Kindle for a while. Took a star off because it crashed several times. Just one star off because it saved at pretty much the point it crashed.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I thought this was on of Grisham's best works to date.  A great twist for a surprise turn of events.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|This old time favorite shares that children need a time to really have a balanced view of living. All is not science and facts there is a lot of mystery and joy to life.
B00AKEMHCA|1.0|It does not tell you how to play so I am really confused do not get this unless you know how to play
B0027MJU00|4.0|A thriller!  I enjoyed it! A good mystery!  I like the author. I read Gone Girl first, and that one was amazing!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I luv this game! Graphics are great and so fun. It is great 4 all animal lovers of all ages.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|While there are a few bucks here and there overall this game is very worth it. There is much to do to keep you occupied and keep you coming back. I haven't had the friend just with at all yet so I can't comment on that, and I never actually had the option to band my house or myself. Regardless the name I ended up with is bearable and I see my own name little enough it doesn't bother me too bad. I wish there was a way to change the names, if there is I can't find it. Very pretty to look at and fun to watch. Also wish there was a way to record the conditions, I would love to actually New able to watch them. You really can't see anything when you are busy keeping an eye on that blue bar.
B0093OGBL6|5.0|Defending a King is exactly that.  Dr. Moriarty has shared with the world a Michael Jackson most of us never got to meet.  The media only thrives on what sells and so many stories that were written about Michael were negative.  This book gives us a look at who Michael really was and what he lived with most of his life.  I would recommend this to not just Michael Jackson fans but to those who have a love of biographies.
B00243FQFA|5.0|I had to order this season because Netflix took the series off before I could watch the last two seasons., Wish there was more.
B00B3MN65K|5.0|One of his best albums to date.  Much more edgy than his past music.  Purchased this album as a gift and the recipient was very happy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's not too easy for me.It's perfect because I love horses . If you don't like horses don't get it.
B00APVC8BI|5.0|Good blu ray remake . Picture quality is one of the best blurays to date. It's definatly a show case movie for hd.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|The fact that the story takes place in Massachusetts and reading a story that takes place in a very famillar area for me is interesting and entertaining.  While the story is compelling , it just seems some what drawn out .  I'm going to stay with it anyway but it hasn't captured my interest yet.  Two of my friends read this story and enjoyed it .  So !  I'm going to try to finish it.  Who knows maybe the tide will turn in another page or two and I'll be riveted !  I hope so.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This is a great game but it doesn't tell u it is not the complete game . But it is a great game
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Not a bad game it's a bit laggy at times and the Plato the tail doesn't seem to actually Plait the horses tail? But other then that it's quite good fun.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I bought it and love it.  It is addicting and time consuming.  Brings back memories of playing as a kid.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Best movie I have seen in many years.  My husband is a History buff totally enjoyed it has watched it 3 times.
B009EEFTMC|1.0|Bought it to keep busy but it's just not fun.  The graphics are horrible. Deleted it shortly after downloading it.
B009X01ELC|5.0|I like this cover a lot. It fits perfectly. Nice viewing in portrait or landscape. Not too bulky. Good quality & price.
B000070WJE|5.0|I got this for my girlfriend. She had never heard it. Now she is a fan. This is a great album. The song feel is our favorite
B0099Y2MYK|1.0|I am really upset about the way in which the \\"entire\\" season Three of Downton Abbey is being marketed. I just spent approx. 35 euro for the \\"complete\\" season 3, which I just finished watching. In talking to my friends in the states, however, I realise that the so-called \\"complete\\" season 3 is nothing of the sort. It is _missing_ the crucial final episode, which I can now only see (a) if I spend over 30 euro again for the single dvd of episode 9 - which I am NOT going to do; or (b) if I spend an undisclosed sum for a TV-Pass on Amazon - which, if you read the small print, states that \\"if you purchase a TV-Pass for a season which has already begun, you will be charged the individual episode fees of all the previous episodes.\\"<br />Er, no, Amazon, I don't think so.  This is misleading marketing and you should be ashamed of yourselves. Plus, all my friends in the states \\"spoiled\\" the ending for me anyway, thinking I had seen it, as I told them I had watched the whole thing.<br />I am furious. Amazon, this time you suck.
B00AZQ4VMC|5.0|Thank you Bryan Ferry for not being predictable (Hello David Bowie).  The Jazz Age is a gorgeous album from start to finish with a jazz twist.  If you like Roxy Music/Bryan Ferry you will most likely love this.  If for some strange reason you have NEVER heard of Bryan Ferry or Roxy music this is a very special way to introduce yourself to one of the most important singers/bands of the past four decades.  The Jazz Age is uplifting, fun, and throughly enjoyable.  \\"Reason or Rhyme\\" and \\"I thought\\" are two of my personal favorites.
B003TXSF5C|5.0|This is an ebook well worth reading. I read Hawkin's book &#34;A Brief History of Time&#34; a long time ago. This ebook is much better. It gives a good description of how the universe started and what is happening now. Of the many ebooks that I have read on this topic, this is among the best.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love Downton Abbey - but we have lost so much this season and now the final blow is almost unbearable.<br />It was way to soon after losing Sybil - and i can't believe this happened. I can only say I sincerely hope it's not as devastating as the ending left us to believe. Please let us all hope the beginning of Season 4 will bring happiness for all the family.<br />I've only found Downton a month ago and have watched all the UK versions which are much better than the US ones.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|it is great and now you can swim it's much better than the first one.it is the best app I ever got!
0446547654|3.0|Overall: decent book.<br /><br />I'll confess, I have enjoyed Sparks novels through the years.  It probably started with my wife - she likes them, too.<br /><br />Generally, the ideas behind the novels have been good; however, this time it felt a little uninspired to me.  Like he ran out of ideas and so used a hybrid of previous plots.<br /><br />Sparks's stories have always impressed me in that he keeps it simple, yet emotionally charged.  It's so easy to connect with the characters, even if you aren't from North Carolina - his standard story setting.<br /><br />If you're a fan, it's still worth a read, but don't expect anything earth shattering...just a pleasant tale.
B003B02O7I|5.0|Just a really good read. I got this book in the recommendation of a friend and I was not disappointed. It is a great story with an unexpectedly fair representation of Christianity and it's beliefs. I felt that all of the characters were believable even though a few were almost caricatures. overall a very good read
B00001U0DP|5.0|Pretty much every person has seen this film (If you haven't, go get it ASAP), so I wont focus in the story (which is excellent).<br />Instead I just wanted to let people know that this version has Italian audio, which is a great way to practice hearing Italian.<br /><br />I speak Spanish (not natively), and practiced Italian for about 4 weeks before a trip to Italy. I was able to pick up enough to converse, but this film was instrumental in practicing HEARING Italian.<br /><br />You can learn to parrot rote phrases fine, but listening and understanding is much harder.<br />The main character in this film speaks VERY rapidly, but he also speaks very clearly. So this film is the perfect film to practice hearing & parsing Italian.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This show is super funny and smart.  I love this show.  The price is very reasonable and Amazon's quality is great.
B004WESFZW|4.0|I saw the preview for this movie before it came out, and it looked like something I'd enjoy.<br />...but then it disappeared. I didn't hear anyone talk about it, and I assumed it did poorly.<br /><br />I added it to my cart to qualify for free shipping, and I was very pleased that it was as good as it was.<br />Well worth the watch. While the story has familiar romance and hero tones, the paradigm of the movie is so unique that it all feels fresh.  I can think of no movie to compare it to.<br /><br />But if you want powerful, poignant endings, be warned that this one is a little anti-climactic.  It isn't a bad ending, but it doesn't compare to the uniqueness of the rest of the film.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|Not the movie, just the transmission. It was terrible, but Amazon - continuing to be the greatest of all companies I have ever been a customer of -  reversed my charge and verified there was a problem with that particular movie and their staff was working on it.  As far as Amazon - I LOVE THEM!  Perhaps I will order the movie again and see if I can like it!
B00005LC1H|5.0|If you haven't seen this, buy it and watch it!<br />I cannot recommend this series highly enough.  It is a short lived series that you can watch in a single sitting, but it will have your sides splitting, & it is great to show at parties.<br /><br />So many popular modern comedies draw from John Cleese, and Fawlty Towers is chock-full of excellent comedy to draw from.<br />I actually like this better than Monty Python, because you don't have to take a break from it to not hate it.  Monty Python wears on you, so it's great to watch every now and again, but if you watch it too often, it feels childish and irritating.  Fawlty Towers deals with a much more mundane subject matter, reigning in the comedians to play in a much less abrasive realm.
B009738XXM|4.0|This album is a lot of fun to put on while driving, cleaning the house, running, whatever. The lyrics aren't anything special, but the music pure pop music.
B0000931QR|5.0|With American Pop-Rock influences, Oreja makes a great album that could compete with many of it's American contemporaries.<br />While they wont win any awards for uniqueness or profound lyrics, you will find yourself humming, whistling, and singing these tunes all day.<br />It is a very solid album.
B009VB97EY|5.0|...And I shall not apologize...<br /><br />I avoided seeing it for quite a while, as I'm not a big fan of the whole male-stripper-thing...<br />However, Channing Tatum brings his incredible dancing to the screen, and makes it so hard to look away.<br /><br />Let's call it a guilty pleasure.
B0013FBS20|4.0|Will Smith delivers another performance so powerful that you can't help but stare in awe before you realize that you are crying.<br /><br />The story was taken from Vincent Price's \\"The Last Man on Earth\\" which was later redone very popular with Charlton Heston in \\"Omega Man.\\"  All 3 films are worth watching, but \\"I am Legend\\" changes the story in some powerful ways.<br /><br />The initial CGI for NY city is amazing.  The digital craftsmanship is phenomenal.<br />Unfortunately the CGI that is front and center in the movie is painfully inadequate (especially on Blu Ray). Basically all living creatures were done poorly. They feel cartoony.<br /><br />So, as long as you go in with the proper expectations about CGI, you can focus on the amazing story telling, plot, and acting.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like having a calculator on the Kindle with it's large numbers, it's handy!  I would recommend this to everyone
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved this book.  Very hard to put down.  I liked the detail of the book more than the movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's fun to play this Solitaire game especially when there is nothing to do or TV programs stink! Play it!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is a very excellent book but some parts were quite annoying to my acknowledgment.  The part about uncle Gary scamming children bursted my bubbles. Though I did like how Rowley was was so splendid with thy fair maiden Abigale.  Jeff Kinney did a splendid job writting this epic sequil to the series.<br />  Also if you get the time watch the great YouTube video NYAN CAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  NYAN NAYN NYAN!!!!!!!!!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I love Stephen King and enjoy this book! It is an amazing story but long book. History, King lovers Buy!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Loved the series and now we are hooked - as they say better late than never.  For anyone not seen it - quick buy now!!
B00BESM14U|4.0|Considered on its qualities as a movie alone, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is pleasantly entertaining and wonderfully nostalgic. The acting ranges from acceptable to great, and the story is both joyous and haunting. The movie manages to make some of the characters shine who in the book hid in the background. But that brings to hand the negative aspects of the movie.<br /><br />Firstly, many--a great too many--characters who were fantastic in the novel are greatly shrouded in the movie. The clearest example of this is the character of Bill (Mr. Anderson in the movie) who--compared to the novel--is nearly written out in the movie. In my personal opinion, Bill is one of the most well-written, most interesting, and most important characters in the novel. Leaving out the plot focused on his and Charlie's relationship was quite an odd choice and also a very poor one. Bill is essentially the Gandalf (wizened sage character) of the novel. Doing this in the movie would be like if Gandalf's role were almost entirely left out of the Lord of the Rings movies; the story would have suffered significantly, as shown by the Perks movie. A few other characters also suffer from this misfortune, including Charlie's sister (who has a name in the movie, Candace) who is the focus of a plot thread very important to Charlie as a character (I won't spoil it here; go read the novel), but no other character of extensive significance--aside from Bill--is overly ignored.<br /><br />As a movie by itself, Perks is highly enjoyable. I certainly recommend it. However, as an adaption of the novel, the movie is sadly disappointing. If you plan to watch this movie, I strongly advise you read the novel first. Watching the movie first would rob you of the amazing experience which the novel provides. Not to say it's a bad film, but it pales in comparison to the novel.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My only complaint is that the 4th season is not yet available! Good stuff. Well done! I don not like the fact that my rating has to include a set # of words.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I just finished this trilogy for the second time and it still is the most gripping story and I could simply start it all over again.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was an excellent book!!!  I felt like the alternate on the jury as I read through the book trying to figure out &#34;who done it.&#34;<br />So many twists, turns, and surprises.  Your heart will race, at times, as you become immersed in the story!!
B00993I6D2|2.0|i read the book many years ago and loved it. somehow, it didn't do the same on film.  in a word?  depressing
B005OKTPKC|3.0|Not one of his best. Perhaps the entire court theme is getting a little old. The first ones like Street Layer etc. were really captivating but it seems 'same old, same old'.
B007QDNKQA|4.0|although i'm not a huge mark wahlberg fan, i liked him in this movie, and i thought he was believable in it, unlike in others.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|This movie is very slow.....although with top actors they did a good job with this. The subject matter was very intense.
B009NX409M|1.0|i love both the actors in this movie, but somehow did not care for them cheating, whether happy or not happy in their marriages.  that's just how i am.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I did enjoy reading this fictional book.  However, the story line was more unusual than I had originally expected.  It was an easy read.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|I loved how this book turned out.  The story kept me reading through expected hook after hook.  I wish there there more books..
B00AG51RU6|4.0|This movie could have been better if Bruce and Henry worked together to save their family. I always adored Bruce's acting whether he's a hard cop or a CIA agent. Bruce could have used his strong techniques in this movie to track down his family and get good credit for his superb acting, that would have made this movie more interesting for everyone to watch and enjoy. Bruce had a friendly appearance in this movie as the mystery CIA dad and he did a wonderful job playing that role. This movie would have been a 5 star if Bruce kept on going. YOU'RE STILL #1 BRUCE!!!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|The story was unexpected and was always throwing another hook.  I couldn't wait to the get to the next books.
B000YN369A|5.0|the entire cd is great!<br />if you love death cab for cutie, you will love this album with the electronica
B003F3FJQO|4.0|I zipped through this one as fast as I could .  I love unexpected story lines and this kept me reading to get to the next book
034580404X|5.0|This book was amazing and very tense but overall I loved it. My son also loved it. I am passing it on to another friend to enjoy it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Story about the terminally ill but not what I expected.  It showed the strength and bravery.  At the end I felt good.
B002KYHZLQ|4.0|I picked up Gardens of the Moon expecting a fantasy of massive proportions, twisting plots that seemed to have no link and many viewpoints to keep straight. I was not disappointed.<br /><br />The only reason I have four stars rather than five was how long it took for me to get hooked. The start was confusing as I didn't get understand the workings of the Malazan world Erikson has created. Once I got into the book though, I couldn't put it down. Now, on to the next!
B0074D3CAQ|1.0|Too drawn out. Thought he would meet interesting people along the way or have interesting experiences but I don't think he did. Author could have done so much more with his journey. I didn't find it uplifting but sad instead.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game because the graphics are great and it teaches you how to take care of a horse
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Best calculator app that I've used to date.  I appreciate the simplicity but also that it can do complex calculations as well.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love it! it is fun and easy.  it is perfect for kids to and I have it on my I pod and it is fun on there to
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Having a fondness for Apple and Apple products, I really enjoyed the history of the events and Walter Isaacson's style in covering it.  It's a great book and well worth reading.
B009M1QRM8|5.0|I'm a big fan of the Pendergast saga and if you are a fan to you get a big surprise. Pendergast has a good and a very bad son...
B0012GMUOU|4.0|What can I say that has not already been said. Jeff Beck is successful in extracting sounds from his strat that are so unique it is often difficult to determine what instrument is being utilized. And he never uses a plectum.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I thought this was a teenage romance novel however, it turned out to be much more than that.I thought it was well written and the anticipation of then first kiss was well worth they read. Story flowed and an easy enjoyable read.

B00821OX98|4.0|Good entertainment if you just want to turn your brain off for a while, it doesn't require much of you.<br />My wife commented that it looked like everyone was a model, no uglies need apply.  Writing mediocre, most acting mediocre, I think the only memorable actor  is (Pope) Colin Cunningham who plays the bad good guy (or good bad guy?).  Lots of actions - stuff blowing up all the time - and demographics was laid out to make sure they had at least one member in every camp.<br /><br />I give it four stars as opposed to less because of something I learned from my father - a very bright intellectual man who I used to catch watching &#34;Dukes of Hazard&#34;.  When I asked him why he would watch such an IQ draining program (beside Daisy Duke), he replied that somethings it was just great to let things go  and waste a little time with something that demanded nothing from you (as in programs like Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad - or Shakespear).  My only real irritation with the show is (Hal) Roy Drew - who seems intentionally made up to look like Mitt Romney - when his regular photos really don't reflect this.

B00A2H9L2E|4.0|This story concludes the one began with the first Silent Hill movie of 2006.  Chris and Sharon DaSilva are on the run from members of the Order.  The Order knows that Sharon is carrying a part of Alessa's soul in her.  She is also in possession of a mysterious round amulet that the cult wants.  Using the names Harry and Heather Mason, the two have been moving constantly from town to town.<br /><br />The story begins with Heather's first day at her new school.  While there, she meets another new student named Vincent Cooper.  Later that day, she learns from a private investigator that the cult has located them.  When Harry fails to show up at their designated meeting place, Heather hurries home to find a message written in blood.  The message instructs her to go to Silent Hill to save her father.  Heather takes the amulet, and with Vincent for company, make their way to Silent Hill, in West Virginia.<br /><br />While resting at a motel, Vincent admits that he is a member of the cult.  He was sent to bring Heather back to Silent Hill.  But he sees that Heather is good, and not evil like Alessa.  He warns her to stay away from Silent Hill.  Undeterred, Heather decides to proceed anyway.  At the hospital, Vincent is attacked by a monster.  The two get separated.  Heather finds Leonard, the former leader of the cult.  Heather mistakenly gives Leonard her half of the medallion/amulet, turning Leonard into a monster.  Meanwhile, the cult wants to punish Vincent for betraying them.  They decide to send him to the asylum for \\"treatment\\".<br /><br />After she manages to get away from Leonard, Heather meets Dahlia outside.  Dahlia tells her that Alessa has given part of her soul, the part that can still feel love, to Heather.  The cult wants to sacrifice her, believing that doing so will bring an end to the nightmare world that Alessa has trapped them in.  That is the reason why the cult has been pursuing Harry and Heather for many years.  They also wanted the amulet that Harry had been hiding.<br /><br />She finds Vincent strapped to a gurney, surrounded by knife-wielding nurses in short, sexy dresses.  Yes, the same ones that Rose had to deal with in the first movie.  Trying her best to keep quiet, she helps Vincent out of his restraints.  But the nurses reacts to the sound and starts slashing at them.  They barely make it out of the hospital.<br /><br />Alessa confronts Heather at the amusement park.  Heather and Alessa fight for dominance, with the former coming out on top.  Now in control, Heather finally confronts the current cult leader, Claudia.  During their exchange, Claudia finally reveals that Heather will be sacrificed in order to birth their God.  As Claudia touches the amulet, she transforms into a beast.  And right at that moment, Pyramid Head shows up.  Claudia and Pyramid Head battle it out.<br /><br />Sean Bean, Carrie-Ann Moss, Malcolm McDowell, and Deborah Kara Unger make up the veteran all-star cast.  Newcomers Adelaide Clemens and Kit Harrington play the roles of Heather and Vincent, respectively.  Needless to say, the acting performances are beyond reproach.  I do not think Sean Bean can be bad at any acting role.  The man is always great at every role he has been in.  The same can be said for Malcolm McDowell and Carrie-Ann Moss.  Adelaide Clemens is a future star.  She has good acting skills and terrific looks to go along with it.  Kit Harrington is reunited with his fellow \\"A Game of Thrones\\" cast member, Sean Bean.  He does a pretty good job here as Vincent, playing an American teenager.<br /><br />Silent Hill and Resident Evil are two of the most successful movie franchises to have been inspired by video games.  Both games came out on the original Sony Playstation.  They were some of the best examples of the Survival-Horror genre.  The popularity of the genre and the dominance of the Sony Playstation console, helped ensure that there would be a large fan base for these games.  And that fandom transferred overto the movie franchises themselves.  Resident Evil has now had five movies.  Hopefully there will be many more movies in the Silent Hill franchise.<br /><br />You should first watch \\"Silent Hill\\" before viewing this one, \\"Silent Hill: Revelation\\".  I highly recommend this movie.to the movie franchises themselves.  Resident Evil has now had five movies.  Hopefully there will be many more movies in the Silent Hill franchise.<br /><br />You should first watch \\"Silent Hill\\" before viewing this one, \\"Silent Hill: Revelation\\".

B000I8HIR2|5.0|Silent Hill is a movie inspired by the video game of the same name.  The game came out on the original Sony Playstation console.  It was one of the first of the so-called &#34;survival-horror&#34; genre of games, which included Resident Evil and Parasite Eve.  The genres popularity, as well as the dominance of the Sony Playstation console, ensured that the movie already had a large fan base even before it opened.<br /><br />Chris and Rose DaSilva are concerned with their adopted daughter's sleepwalking habits.  During these episodes, Sharon keeps referring to &#34;Slient Hill&#34;, a town in nearby West Virginia.  Rose then takes it upon herself to drive to Silent Hill, with Sharon in tow.  Miles outside of Silent Hill, she stops at a gas station.  While there, the attendant warns her not to proceed to the town.  Evidently, the town was evacuated many years before.  This is coal mine country.  Fire got started in the coal mines, deep beneath the town.  The fires continue to burn to this day, making Silent Hill a danger zone.<br /><br />Rose drives through the barricades and proceeds to the ghost town.  Meanwhile, a mysterious motorcycle police officer is in pursuit.  Rose swerves to avoid hitting a child, and runs off the road.  When she wakes up, Sharon is missing.  Rose starts to walk down the empty streets.  She meets up Dahlia, who informs her that she believe Sharon is actually Alessa.  With fog blanketing the town and ashes falling from the sky, Rose runs back to the car.  There, she meets up with Officer Cybil Bennett.  Together, they continue the search for Sharon.<br /><br />They learned that the town is not empty.  Silent Hill is populated by the members of a cult.  As darkness descends, they follow the members to the safety of a church.  While there, they are captured by the cult, led by the insane Christabella.  Slowly, the story of Silent Hill and Alessa begin to unfold.  Dahlia had a daughter out of wedlock.  Condemned by the town as an abomination, Alessa grew up without friends.  Other children tormented her, while the adults did not do anything to stop the bullying.  Christabella convinces Dahlia that the cult can help.  She proposes a ritual that would &#34;cleanse&#34; Alessa.  Dahlia agrees.  The cult takes Alessa into their church and straps her to an iron wheel.  Dahlia realizes too late that the cult intends to burn Alessa to death.  The cult proceeds with the ritual and sets Alessa aflame.  During the ritual, an explosion rocks the town.  The fire gets out of control.  Dahlia and the police arrive to stop the ritual.  Alessa, horribly burned but still alive, is taken to the hospital by Officer Gucci.  Alessa's anger and rage pulls the entire town into an alternate reality, created by her mind.  Her powers, fueled by anger and hate traps the town and the cult members into her dreamworld, filled with horrors.  Meanwhile, Alessa takes that part of her soul which is still good and manifests it into another child, Sharon.  Sharon is the &#34;good&#34; half of Alessa.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Chris arrives at the outskirts of town to look for his wife and daughter.  Stopped by the same Officer Gucci, Chris learns the tragic story of the town.  Unable to proceed into town, he then returns home.<br /><br />This is a very good horror movie.  Sean Bean, Radha Mitchell, Laurie Holden, Alice Kriege, Kim Coates, and Deborah Kara Unger make up the all-star cast.  Laurie Holden probably gave the best performance out of the group, playing the role of a dedicated police officer.  She plays the tough but very beautiful policewoman, Cybil Bennett.  Laurie Holden, with her short blonde hair and slender figure, looked sexy in her motorcycle policewoman's outfit.  Kim Coates was also very good as the compassionate Officer Gucci.essa grew up without friends.  Other children tormented her, while the adults did not do anything to stop the bullying.

B000FC2L1E|5.0|The third installment(Following Outlander and Dragonfly in Amber) of the Outlander series will leave you breathless! For entertainment, for education in 18th Century life, for sheer audacity in story-telling, for book group discussions, for whatever reason you pick this book up, you'll turn the pages until the last one, which provides clues to the next one! While I had difficulty in the beginning with the initial premise, I had no problem traveling back in time with this series!

B00122MBY8|4.0|Overall the album is great.  The first three songs are terrific and I'm not sure why I had never heard them before on the radio when I was younger.  The rest of the album is still very good, but it is a little repetitive, in that Mr. Morrison has &#34;vocal solos&#34; and repeats the same two or three words over and over for what seems like an eternity at times.  I'm sure it's artistic some how, but I'm not accustomed to whatever style that is.  It can be a little too much to handle at times.  I did still buy the album after having listened to the whole album a couple of times on Rhapsody, so it's still very good overall.

B007SGLZP8|2.0|This novel started strong out of the gate but then simply faded to the back of the pack.  I went from not being able to put it down to having to force myself to finish it.

The cooking sections  which included general tips and specific menus were helpful and I tried many of the recipes that were included in the book. The non-cooking related stuff - survival tactics, hunting etc were entertaining. I admire the way Ferriss attacks learning a new skill.

B009NPA3Q4|4.0|Well, it's finally happened. After eleven seasons, I've finally bought an album by an &#34;American Idol&#34; winner. Oh, sure, I've bought a few albums from past contestants (Melinda Doolittle, Michael Johns, Crystal Bowersox), all of which I've really enjoyed, but no winner has moved me enough to pick up something. (In all fairness, I've always said I would pick up a Greatest Hits from Kelly Clarkson...hey, she's had some of the best singles of the last 20 years!).<br />  Until Phillip Phillips, that is. There's just something organic and real and smart about him...he makes you WANT to invest the time in a career that you know will be long lasting. Yes, he won, but there's not an ounce of reality show gloss to him whatsoever. Right from the start, you could tell this was an artist who was in it for the long haul, key word being &#34;artist.&#34;<br />  Phillips hits the ground running with the stellar &#34;Man On The Moon.&#34; Everything just comes together perfectly here....an insanely tuneful arrangement, crisp instrumentation, a spirited lead vocal....it doesn't get better than this! A hit single waiting to happen.<br />  And speaking of hit singles, there's no denying &#34;Home&#34; was one of 2012's best singles. Not only was it a great song, but it was the perfect match up of song and artist. (In fact, if you didn't know better, you would swear this was a Phillips original!). Brilliant!<br />  I wasn't nuts about &#34;Gone, Gone, Gone&#34; at first (and I'm still not sure about it as a single), just because it wasn't much of a stretch. But there's no denying that Phillips' lead vocal is spot-on, particularly at the bridge, and the track just kind of grows on you with repeated listens.<br />  &#34;Hold On&#34; is short and sweet, graced by a soaring vocal and deep, thoughtful lyrics. Lines like &#34;I fall into a sacred rage to escape/The hells of the world made of puppets and fake&#34; are those of a true poet, someone who REALLY has something to say. This is the real deal.<br />  There's no denying the Dave Matthews comparison, but &#34;Tell Me A Story&#34; proves it's just a jumping off point. This track is wise, intimate and way beyond something you would expect from someone in their early twenties. Delicate, yet powerful, &#34;Tell Me A Story&#34; is yet another winner.<br />  &#34;Get Up Get Down&#34; is one of TWFTSOTM's few misfires...there's just a calculated, forced vibe to the pseudo-funky cut. It's clear that Phillips can rock out when he wants to, but this seems...fake. Add lyrics that run the gamut from silly to painful and you have a track that's WAY below the high standards of the rest of the disc.<br />  Far better is &#34;Where We Came From&#34;, easily the album's top track. When you have a sublime, seductive arrangement, slinky instrumentation, a killer chorus that dances around in your head long after the song ends and lyrics that hit home (&#34;I must have used up all my wishes yesterday/Because the words we said in anger still echo in my brain&#34;), well, it doesn't get much better than this!<br />  &#34;Drive Me&#34; is another misstep. Weighted down by a klunky arrangement and cliched lyrics ~ &#34;I'm the puppet to your strings&#34;....really?!? ~ this track just comes across as a stab at something &#34;different&#34;...for difference's sake. In the end, though, it just doesn't work.<br />  It's the complete opposite with &#34;Wanted Is Love&#34;...there's some real thought and emotion here. From the mournful cello to the sweeping arrangement, the instrumentation perfectly cushions Phillips' lead vocal, allowing it to dip and soar. This is pop music at it's most imaginative best.<br />  Equally as strong is &#34;Can't Go Wrong.&#34; There's just an earthy honesty to the cut that's undeniable. When Phillips sings &#34;I can't go wrong/As long as I remember where I'm from&#34;, you know this kid's REAL. Toss in a total toe-tapper of an arrangement and you have yet another gem.<br />  &#34;A Fool's Dance&#34; is the only Phillips original that doesn't quite work. Busy and bloated, I get the feeling that this was an early effort, written before he had honed his self-editing skills. Full of his influences vs. himself, it's not a bad track...just not a great one.<br />  The standard disc wraps up with the romantic &#34;So Easy.&#34; There's a relaxed, easy-going groove to this mid-tempo ballad that gets under your skin and stays there. Phillips' buoyant lead vocal warmly wraps around the touching lyrics, all comfy and cozy. Very nice.<br />  The two deluxe versions include bonus tracks of varying degrees. &#34;Hazel&#34; has a nice, breezy vibe to it, while the cover of Chris Isaak's &#34;Wicked Game&#34; is stunning....it's almost like a brand new (original) song. Once again, this is a true artist.<br />  The live version of &#34;Home&#34; just shows how comfortable Phillips has gotten with the song in a relatively short period of time, while &#34;Take Me Away&#34; is pretty much a generic throwaway cut.<br />  I'm still on the fence over the cover of &#34;Thriller.&#34; On the one hand, this song just can't be covered....outside of the original Jackson context, it just seems trite. On the other hand, though, the bluegrass-tinged arrangement does draw you in.<br />  That said, I can't wait to see what comes next. As good as THE WORLD FROM THE SIDE OF THE MOON is, I can't help but feel it's only scratched the surface of what Phillip Phillips is capable of. This is someone who's in it for real. And to that I say &#34;Amen!&#34; (As with all my reviews, I'm giving the disc an extra half a star for including the lyrics, but I'm also docking it half a star for offering one of the deluxe versions at one retailer only).l's Dance&#34; is the only Phillips original that doesn't quite work.

B009ZE27US|1.0|this thing is a cool prank but got me grounded so I deleted it but if my grandma would lighten up a bit but its still pretty cool
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Can't decide what to make of this newest 007. Seems as if Daniel Craig will be phased out next time. He is getting old and that is part of the plot of the movie. Not a lot of gadgety toys but a return to basics. Adele's song, at the beginning , only makes sense at the end.  And there a glimpse of 007's past and devotion to England.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|I've only used this a few times, but I have enjoyed it very much. All i can say is try it.
B008FRFN7A|4.0|Was very helpful setting up printing.  You just have to make sure that your wireless HP printer is new enough to do it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I like to read and this will let me get the books I want without having to go the book store and get 2 or 3 at a time.  Will spread the spending out a little.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Works great with my ASUS Transformer Pad Infinity TF700T. Make sure to get a charger if you don't have a PS3 like me.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|This was a nice past time read for me.  I usually read on my commute to and from work and this was exactly what I needed.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Puller does it again! I want more of Agent Puller!  He should be a regular series!  The subject matter of this book is very modern day.  Something we should all take more seriously.  This is one I think I would read again!
B005IQ39AY|3.0|Popping the bubbles was fun. Love the bubble bombs that blow many bubbles at one time. It has lots of different special bubbles that makes this game interesting.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Baldacci does it again!  And I love Agent Puller!  This is a superb book and very well written!  It just pops off the page!
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I rated this 4 stars because it does provide fun and challenging oneself. It's quick and easy to play with.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it its gr8 and I think any one of any age can love it!! its addicting and a gr8 game awesome graphics I think everyone should get it!!
B006GLMHBM|5.0|I love this show! Sex and the City is a masterpiece!! You won't regret buying this show and watching all the seasons.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|Eccleston and Piper were great picks to get this series back on the air. Doctor Who is a must watch for all Sci-Fi fans.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Great, open choice game.  The game allows for free movement without constraints.  However, the &quot;hint&quot; button gets you back on track if you want a little direction.  Good game, decent price.  Won't rock your world if you're a hard-core gamer.  Would have given 5 stars if the price were $1.99...
B001UGB1X8|5.0|We loved it! We've watched Tommy Lee for a long time and can't remember ever being disappointed. Certainly not this time. everyone did a great job. We had a small fun wager on who owned the blue car.<br />Well constructed, well played. Real insight to people, time and place.  Best line:&#34;No Pa cause I told him what you'd do to him if he did.&#34;
B0070Y46UY|2.0|I still haven't finished this and have since moved on. after five chapters I still have no idea what it's about.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I am a big fan of Myron Bollitar (Harlan Coben) and enjoy this type of main character. Puller becomes a &#34;super hero&#34; in this book and Baldacci keeps you interested from page one. I've read most of Baldacci's book and this is one of his best. The intrigue and turn of events constantly keeps the reader is a state of &#34;can't wait to turn the page&#34;.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This was a very interesting book that gave you a little insight into what goes on in the foster care system and also stimulated an interest in the meaning of flowers.  It will make me think next time I purchase flowers for someone.  The book kept me turning pages from beginning to end.
B008FPOIT6|3.0|I found the characters interesting and the story kept moving.  The story line was fun if a little juvenile.  I could see this as an adolescent movie script.
B00499QUK2|5.0|I heard friends talking about this in Facebook, so I found it through Amazon Instant video.  This show is addictive.  I watched both seasons in two days.  (My only complaint is there are only three shows per season.). Now I'm left pining for more.  If you are a Steven Moffatt fan (Doctor Who), then you have to watch this show.  The actors are amazing as well.  So good!!!!!
B007THA4FI|3.0|The characters were interesting but too one demential.  The story meandered into their lives but they didn't grow or change based on events.  Nice snapshot of rural English life.  I felt no reason to continue reading except that my book club was going to discuss the book.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This is such a powerful resource. I knew we were on the same track but felt like we never could explain our needs well. This was the missing link! Love languages found and ready to implement!
B0084B5TK8|4.0|just as I thought it should have been. Really like that I could get this one from audiable for free also.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A fast  paced book. I recommend this book. I didn't expect the ending.  I thought it would take a different direction.
1250006341|5.0|Not only beautiful pictures of the cast, but such an interesting inside look at the era.  So happy to have this book.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I started watching in it's 3rd season and absolutely became a Castle addict. The cast just all fit together perfectly. I've purchased seasons 1, 2, and 3. Had recorded most of season 4 and had a Castle marathon while recovering from surgery. I viewed the beginning of season 5 episodes on Amazon and am now up to date.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I watched season 1 through 3 on amazon instant video.  Love the fact that I could do that.  Can't wait until season 4.
B00014TJ6Q|5.0|Everyone knows \\"All Things Must Pass\\" is George Harrison's best solo album. It may be the best solo album of all time from a departing band member. This 1976 album is filled with Top 40 quality songs, including \\"Blow Away,\\" \\"Faster,\\" \\"Not Guilty\\" (from his Beatles days) and \\"Soft Touch.\\" But dig deeper and the quality doesn't drop off. That is the mark of a classic album. If you don't have this CD, your Beatles collection isn't complete.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|*Actually I bought it once, left it with the amazon.com shipping packaging, and recycled it without ever opening it- so tragic!<br /><br />It really is a good movie though, but you should probably just buy it once.  No need to get crazy with it.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I will definitely buy Season 3 when it's cheaper.  Great series.  I will also buy Kindle Fire the price comes down.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy Downton Abbey.  It is an entertaining and wonderful series.  My favorite show.  Would hate to miss a show.
B0055B7K7A|5.0|Great movie for young and old.  We've rented it now about 6 times ... guess next time we'll buy it.  Appears it will be a staple around our house for a long time!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|i love this game, i played frontierville on facebook so when i seen this i had to give it a go, and i fell in love with it..the only thing i see that i would change is on the goals they are starting to ask for things that you have to pay cash for and some of these things are alot of cash..not cool
B000U0O9FM|5.0|Yeah, this was a good book. I enjoyed the read even though I'd already seen the movie a dozen times. There are a few differences between the book and movie, but they are good differences. Read the book, or don't. You should never take advice from strangers. I could be a complete idiot for all you know
B000001F9N|5.0|Donna Summers has an amazing voice and the music touches your soul and leaves a desire to dance/ If you ever liked Disco, or want to feel what Disco was about, this is a CD to get
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I really love the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series!! I really don't dislike anything about the series!! Just keep making the series:)
B00008WT5J|5.0|Like the music, especially &#34;Hells Bells&#34;, one of my all-time favorite songs. CD sound is excellent,and songs on CD are good!<br />Recommend to any rock lover
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The best Calculator app I have found.. Simple, easy, fast..... Stores previous calculations so you can pull them back up... Very Easy to use....... THANKS
B008F5YDRI|5.0|Terrific movie.  Very well acted, scenery beautiful and terrific story.  Would highly recommend seeing thisi movie. Ewan McGregger was wonderful.
B0097PW7H8|1.0|This is pretty worthless for my kindle.  It doesn't offer anything my kindle doesn't already show me.  I deleted it.
B0080K3G4O|1.0|While he has a valid point to make and brings in some quite amusing examples to back up his viewpoint. In my oppinion the subject could be easily covered in a book half the length without any loss of purpose.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|Its nice to watch a program that has a great cast, fun characters, and plenty of music to listen to all wrapped into one series. Looking forward to see what is coming next in future seasons.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|A great tale of the sea, pirates and adventure for all ages. I read this book as a youngster and it still entertains years later.
B008FYZIVY|4.0|I like it very much, the only detail is that only have subtitles in english, it does not show spanish, Other than than is just great
B0091XIZO0|5.0|The rendering of the Chopin was exceptional, Lang Lang is and exceptional talent in my opinion.  It is one of several CD I have by him and I like them all.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I personally don't like sharp objects, but the reviews I read made the book sound more interesting than scary.  She created a very interesting character, different than what I've experienced in life.<br />A great read.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Best Nicholas Sparks love story I have read.  Ending really got me by surprise.<br />You must read it. The movie is out, can't imagine it being any better.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|A very powerful acting performance by Denzel portraying an airline caption who despite saving a large number of people during a crash landing, has to cope with demons of alcohol that have controlled his life leading up to and after the crash.  Washington's performance is definitely worth his nomination.  Unfortunately for him, he's up against Daniel Day-Lewis.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is another winner for Colleen Hoover. She gives her characters great voice and leads you into the story effortlessly. It also covers a wide range of age groups as her audience. I recommend it. Very nicely written.
B00B7G3NFU|3.0|A very touching story about a paralyzed poet trying to experience his first sexual encounter.  Definitely worth renting for movie goers, but don't expect to be blown away by it.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|The show is entertaining.  Lucy Liu adds a great personality to the show.  Even though it is another cop show, I find myself watching every episode.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Excited that my hubby requested to purchase this musical, watched today and it was perfect. No issues with the product. Received with in two days. Great Show!
B005V2S7FW|2.0|You have to pay for the use of this on the Kindle.  It is not expensive but it is free on a computer.  There are a few others you can get for free so I deleted this one before I had to activate and pay for using it.
B009UZBLSG|4.0|Theres alot of hype around Oya and other Android consoles but why bother? Your Android phone can already do all of it! You can even connect it to your Wiimote, PS3 controler, or other bluetooth controller. This will mirror whatever your doing on your phone so just connect it to your TV and your phone is now a console! Make sure you plug it in for extended use.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Not the greatest, and I sure would like to tweak more than you can but it is do-able for passing a quick amount of time.  I don't stick with it long and it is not generous at all with letting the user win.
B00BEL4P9Q|4.0|I was so disappointed at the ending of Season 3 that I almost decided not to continue the series.<br />Perhaps others felt the same way.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|The trial is ok, the full application is all you need for productivity and nicely done.  Easy to use and full of all options you will need.  I was fortunate to find this one in the free app of the day at Amazon over the Christmas holiday's.  But now that I have it and used it, I'd pay the money gladly.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Once I started reading this book I couldn't put it down. I would've finished in one day but I had to work. I can't wait to start the next book.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I like to clean un-needed data from my Kindle.  This does the job all in one swoop.  It's simple and helpful.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|WILL GO DOWN AS ONE OF THE CLASSIC BOND MOVIES.... GREAT ACTION SCENES AND I LIKE THE FACT THEY BROUGHT SOME &#34;ITEMS&#34; BACK FROM THE PAST.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed this book immensely. It was a really engaging book that I just couldn't put down. More young adult books should tackle societal and governmental issues.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Even if you are not a typical reader of fantasy/swords and armor lliterature, I think that you will enjoy this book.  Very well written, engaging.  It's like a gourmet mental potato chip.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|The only crticism I can every come up with for a John Scalzi book is that all the characters tend to have similar fast-paced witty styles but it's a style that I happen to like and I always enjoy his books.  This one will be particularly fun for any fun of Star Trek or other Sci Fi TV show from the 80s/90s.  Loved it cover to cover.  Such a novel concept.  :)
B00280LYIM|1.0|when i was getting ready to read the labyrinth but it did not work !!!!!!!!!this this kindle stinks worst invention yet! ;-(
B007SGM084|1.0|Other reviews had inferred that the plot grew more important by the 3rd book but I couldn't even get half-way into the 3rd book before giving up on it.  Ever 3rd page was another disconnected flashback of yet another gratuitous and repetitive sex scene.  I was at least entertained by the uniqueness of the first book enough to get me past the weak characterization and non-existant plot, but I have given up on this trilogy, and have officially deleted the books from my kindle without finishing it and I am not even slightly curious as to how the &#34;plot&#34; ends.  To be fair, the final book might very well get better shortly after where I stopped reading... but my personal time is worth too much to me to invest in this trilogy any more.  :(  Kudos to the author for writing something that has caused such a stir, but it's not my cup of tea.
B006225RN0|4.0|If you like the Highlander moives you will like this.  I purchased it so I would have all the movies.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|This movie is entertainment and I was entertained.  I like the list of stars included in the movie and would watch #3 if they ever made one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great for horse or animal lovers, also if you like to be competitive you will want to do your best at winning the competitions
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Really enjoyed this looking forward to the sequel!!  Kept my interest and was fun playing it on the Kindle Fire HD had no problems played smoothly, now will download the sequel!!!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|After several attempts, we just gave up.  This logo and game name is the one we choose each time.  Very frustrating!  How do we get Temple Run 2?
B0091REZMW|3.0|Good free hidden objects game. Takes too long to regenerate energy though. Sometimes it doesn't start right up. So yeah.
B005DD7H50|4.0|If you liked Bradley Cooper in other movies you'll like him in this too. Good drama too for it's genre.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game beats many that I have played recently, and I play a lot of these type of games! The plot is great and the graphics are amazing! Good work Big Fish Games! Keep em' coming!
B000I5SY5U|4.0|I really enjoyed her mothers singing and acting so it's no surprise I enjoy her's also. But then again I enjoy most musical movies.
B005IQ39AY|2.0|I love this game but after awhile it stopped working.  So I don't know if it is a glitch in the program or if I need to upgrade it.  I cannot find the answer on my kindle.
B009G78EE2|5.0|He's not what you might expect, he is a very deep rapper with excellent lyrics.  Recommended this album to all of my friends.
B006MHWXMS|2.0|App is sorely missing a vital and key feature for app to be used on a daily basis safely by the community and business professionals alike…that being a security feature, whether it be a password to access the app or a password to lock individual tasks, appointments, reminders, etc. or BOTH. Won't run on Android as of Oct., 15. Fix it  Upon accessing the app it shows all your personal and private (tasks) details to whomever picked up your device or have stolen your device.  Please implement a security and/or password feature on your app.
B0098466CK|5.0|Fantastic production, Awesome lyrics, superb riffs, These guy's are a breath of fresh air in the rock world. Will be buying all there albums.
B0094K1QR8|4.0|I enjoyed watch &#34;No Strings Attached.&#34;  It was funny and entertaining. ....... ........ ........ ...... ..... ..... ........ ....... ....
B004SBS8LA|5.0|It is different enough from the original Angry Birds games to give some variety and a different kind of challenge.
B004A2V3K0|5.0|I love this band and this is a great way for me to listen to the band...it is my wake up music.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game very awsesome cool.  All my friends n family have this. My kids n there friends also...<br />BUT YOU GUYS SHOULD HSVE LEVELS DIFFERENT WORLDS DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS NOT ONCE A MONTH.  SOME PPL DONT HAVE FACEBOOK TO PLAY FRIENDS.
B003MU9D0S|4.0|Sabriel is well written, well structured and a good read. It has strong female characters and does not dwell in tedious detail on weaponary or violence as so much of the fantasy genre tends to. While it is part of a series, it can stand alone as an individual story and I think it is the best of the three.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|We loved this movie! Great for kids and adults. Thankful we got to watch this a few times and now we're thinking about buying it!
B001TK3XQI|5.0|Enjoyed the book quite a bit.  Vast number of resources and follow up websites.  Wish I could insert a photo of what I think of this book - wouldn't that be more appropriate.  Pink writes in a format that is easily understood.  Would love to see the concepts of this book revisited and updated to current issues.  Reading the selling book now - can't say I'm as enthused about the Pink's book on selling - slow start.
B002ZG997C|5.0|Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman give great performances in this one. Mila Kunis also gives a great performance too. I recommend this movie to everyone. I have seen this one several times already and have enjoyed it each time.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The ending was not what I was expecting. I expected a better ending for katniss. I do like who she ended up with in the end. But still, the ending just seemed to downward spiral from all the action in the book. A little disappointed.
B000EHQTZO|5.0|The one and only ORIGINAL Classic. Very highly recommended Fay Ray movie. with Robert Armstrong and Bruce Cabot. Good story with very good actors. Highly recommended.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I enjoy reading romance stories and this is one of the best I have read in several months.  Harlequin writers are good.
B002L4QP0M|4.0|Another real page turner by Archer. Not his best but for those of us Archer fans, it was a fun read.
B007HACDLK|5.0|It's Vince Flynn writing, how could it not be a great book? Mitch Rapp is in top form yet again.
B00846F1YW|3.0|This is a decent game.  It does get repeative.  It is possible to zoom in, but to move around, it will cost time.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|To me, not quite as good as Season 1 but still wonderful.<br />The acting is superb. Every character comes alive and the viewer shares in the joys and sorrows of each
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Downton Abbey is very interesting and fills my romantic interest in this time period.  This season was very sad with the deaths and drama. I hope the next season is a little more upbeat and happy.  The actors are very belivable in their respective roles.<br />Season is to short, and I can't wait to the next season.
B003U4ZOQ8|5.0|Lost is a T.V.show like no other. It is a non stop roller coaster ride. It has an incredible plot and amazing actors.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Yahoo Mail has been around for many years because they perform a great service that's easy to use. Their news and entertainment distribution is fun and easy to use as well. Of course being free is especially good. May that always continue.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|WOW, what a read..Beautiful love story.<br /><br />A page turner.....Life do throw us some curve balls but as long as you have someone who is there for you and even love you  through your ups and downs, things will work out in the end.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I'm not sure where to begin. Just what an emotional ride this book is. I smiled, cried, and felt a strong connection with the characters. The element of mystery surrounding it all is very well done, though without given too much away I was deeply affected by having my suspicious confirmed. I didn't guess it all though, and I actually gasped out loud at one point as everything came together.<br /><br />It was a nice change of pace too having the main drama of they plot come from outside of Holder and Sky's relationship. They very much have a united front through much of the story. However, what they do deal with is so far from the childishness of a love triangle or worrying about if one loves the other. They struggle through some very scary adult situations that frankly no one should have to come to terms with. Ever.<br /><br />I can't help but be moved by Sky's strength and resilience. I love too how Holder just gets her so well is there to support her when she needs it, but also lets her stand on her own when she needs that too.<br /><br />I just devoured their story and will be looking for more from this author.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome by the way your mom told me to get it it is gust like temple run but better
B0092MKFIY|3.0|I love &#34;Radioactive&#34; and &#34;Bleeding Out&#34;!  Other than that the album is just okay to me.  Those two songs are definitely worth buying though.
B004LWZW9C|4.0|If you liked Valentine's Day, you will enjoy this one.  Great cast, cute story!  Great holiday movie all around!  Won't win any awards, but is enjoyable nevertheless.
B005PK56TA|5.0|TV - My wife loves this stuff & I enjoy it alot. Yea Amazon !!<br />We enjoy TV on the fly without commercials. We picked this because really like the genre but the availability is the wonderful part of this experience !
B004DK5CYM|5.0|This was quite an enjoyable movie.  Exciting to watch.  I remember the days when Secretariat was all over the news, and now I see why.  Great movie to watch over and over again.  My whole family enjoyed this one.
B000OZ0NXA|1.0|Until I saw ads for the Jack Reacher movie,(haven't seen movie yet) I was attracted by the fact the hero is an ex MP. Being a former army MP myself. I read the first book (Killing Floor) and it is set in Georgia where I live and it was blatantly clear the author knew nothing about the US Army, MIlitary Police, Georgia, Atlanta, the Atlanta airport, Augusta or American cell phone service.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game is awesome. I have a hard time putting it down. its so addicting but so much fun. LOVE it
B005LAII0S|3.0|julia roberts is like jennifer annison they both believed in the fairy tale and tried to re-create it . not possible.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|A co-worker of mine got me watching this show,after the first episode I was hooked... I ordered the first season from amazon and it came in a few days after ordering defiantly a great buy...
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I have yet to re-watch this but my daughter fancied it. If you quote films verbatim, then this will definitely have you randomly quoting scenes..lol
B007PTJOV0|4.0|My 6 year old likes it, Reminds me of the classic Mario brothers  game but with a leprechaun and a pot of gold.
B007LGPSX0|4.0|great to see the crazy styles and teen angst of the 90s.  Need additional episodes added as soon as possible!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun and adicting.it is colorful and interesting.you will like it. This is a new game like no other.
B001AQR3E4|5.0|Pinnacle of technology that you can grab 90's classics such as this on Blu Ray.<br /><br />Now I just need them to work their way back chronologically to Point Break...
030758836X|5.0|This was the most surprising, riveting, well-written book that I have read, well, maybe ever.  I hated him, then I hated her, then I wanted to put a net over each of their heads, then I just wanted to know them because they both are SO smart and interesting.  I have never been a fan of the sequel (and a big part of me wants sleeping dogs to lie), but it's hard to let go of theories about what happens next.  I know what I'm going to do next--get a copy of DARK PLACES or SHARP OBJECTS (Gillian Flynn's other books.
B009AMAGXK|5.0|This movie was amazing ! Some question if it fits the series and I think they did the best they possibly could do ! It's so hard to interpret EVERYONE'S thoughts of the characters into a movie and I thought it was amazing !!! I definitely love it and recommend it to anyone !!!
B002Z8IWMS|5.0|Steve was a master at simplicity! Author Carmine Gallo opened a wonderful world into Steve Jobs presentation secrets. This book should be on the shelf of every great presenter!
B004JN1D2I|2.0|I just could not get into this.  There are so many characters in seemingly unrelated venues.  I quit after a few chapters in the first book.
B00BETX5PS|2.0|Such a cliched theme...didn't live up to my expectation. Liked the villain though...Should have had some nice girls....Some good action sequences...other than that...boring..
B009EEFTMC|4.0|It.s fun to play and hard to put down. I would give it 5 stars, but it locks up sometimes on my nook tablet.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I watched this movie 3 times.. It never stops being funny. It really is enjoyable and everyone should watch it.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|LA UTILIZO TODO EL TIEMPO. MUY BUENA CALCULADORA, PARA LA TABLET. LA RECOMENDO. ADEM&Aacute;S SE GUARDA AUTOMATICAMENTE LAS SUMAS COMO SI FUERA PAPEL
B003JTHXOK|2.0|Ever since the beginning it was easy to predict how the story will go. I love you on the first date? Awkward. Didnt like it
1449325947|5.0|I love this book-- like most in this series, it educates you about current /best practices in CSS in a clear and engaging manner.
B000002KDX|5.0|I had this on LP and finally relplaced it on CD.  The acoustic guitars are wonderful.  I really missed listening to this album.
B004EPZ084|4.0|This movie is absolutely hilarious, outrageous and side splitlingly funny.<br /><br />If you really want a great Saturday night movies, that is going to leave you so entertained, this is the one for you.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Can't wait to see more next season.  Interestering twist on the modern &#34;super hero&#34;.  Nice twist to have mom in the mix with the bad guys.  Keep up the good work.
B000YH6YG8|5.0|All Americans need to see this movie.  It really teaches you a valuable lesson in racism, and the negative effects that are the ultimate outcome, of these most offensive ideas.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Loved it great game the only thing i dont like are the adds plz make an add free version this games really fun i recommend it o everyone
B0006Z2LH4|4.0|This movie wasn't as good as the original movie that inspired its conception but it was entertaining. I didn't care too much for the acting of the \\"leader\\" of the \\"upper level of authority\\" but I bought the movie so I bore with it

B005EPKS8A|5.0|THE BLUES BROTHERS IS AN AWESOME CD WITH SOME OF THE BEST BLUES SONGS ALL IN ONE !!! I WILL LISTEN TO THIS CD JUST ABOUT EVERY DAY!
B0072OFM28|5.0|I bought this for my son-in-law and he likes this kind of films.  I would never watch this as i don't like blood, guts, unhappy movies.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Turn the cube around and try to find matching pieces. Very very addicting. I was hooked from the first game.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|This was purchased for my son-in-law who likes this type of film, unlike me who can't stand the blood and fighting.
B005HSL626|4.0|Got the free version for my son (2) to play. He loves it. It's great for hand and eye coordination.
B0037BB00I|5.0|Its not as great as 21 or skyfall but its still worth owning, this girl is amazing to say the least :)
B00A757EFW|3.0|Fun classic game but I had difficulties getting the pac-man to move where I wanted him to go. He kept getting stuck in corners.
B00005JNQS|5.0|We bought this as a birthday present for a little boy we know, and he loved it :) Ive seen it before and it is really cute and a good present for any kid :)
B003MS0UHU|5.0|Downloaded it for my son (2) and he LOVED it. Can never go wrong with dinosaurs. Thinking about buying it so I always have it on my Kindle
B0050PYNO4|5.0|Its not for everyone, some people might thinks its dumb, but I thought it was cute and humorous, maybe don't buy but rent if you really arent into the silly kind of comedy...
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Fun and addicting. I have always been a fan of Mahjong so I had to get this game. It's is great.

B00AGOGOLE|3.0|App needs more options other than just taking the picture. Maybe I just need to shop around more and check out other apps.
B003L77G6A|5.0|We love this show, its full of smart comedy and always has a nice twist at the end of the season to keep you wanting more!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This game is great! It doesn't lag and doesn't take long for it to load. There's just a couple problems. One,you can only get diamonds if you log into Facebook. Two, the game uses WiFi so when I'm on the road, I can't play it.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This got insanely hard super quick, but if you're ready for the challenge, this game can be a holiday in and of itself. The only downside: Later in the game, I had to purchase any hints if I was stuck. In retrospect, that only motivated me to play without the hints! A great brain-game for all ages.
B0070Y46UY|1.0|4star<br />Liked the living to the fullest attitude<br />A kid his age could just have just given up due to all adversity and gone during the first few days it would have been very understanding<br /><br />Loved that it tested my vocabulary and for that reason alone I wish to read it over
B002L5KKK2|4.0|Great look at NY-South Bronx in 60's, great acting, and Chazz P.'s story  based on his life made into a play is fascinating.  I see why De Niro wanted to make this. His love of music is all over it.
B005IQZB14|5.0|A well written journey that leaves behind the message...just keep moving forward if you want to reach your goal or realize tour dream. When you sit still you get stuck! Fabulous and exciting. a MUST read!
B00991TCOG|4.0|This rating reflects what I think of this Lindesys´s CD. Some musics I just hear every single day at my job. Some musics sound rather the  same as others. I like some musics very much and my coleagues and my family say the same.
0525952926|3.0|His first book was better in this trilogy. The second one started off well enough, but quickly became repeative and predictable. Too many coincidences of characters coming together at historical points that would have been against all probability.  While there certainly were gay individuals at that time, the precentage of charcters who are gay in each of these family units is totally unrealistic. The Winds of War is a much better read as a historical novel.  A nice read if you have nothing else to do if you don't mind wasting your life's breath.
B004QOB8SO|4.0|I bought this film to may dougthers that love both actors, the amazing stories and like to hear the original sound in the british english.
B00005N6KG|3.0|These headphones are great in the gym because they don't fall out of my ears and don't make me sweat around the ears.  The only negative thing I can say is: For a couple of pennies more, Sony could have made the cord about 12&#34; longer.
B003KK65KG|4.0|very good reading would recommend it be compulsory reading in all high school , it deals with the terrible results of bullying and the author has a wonderful gift in bringing this to the fore<br /><br />very enjoyable
B00364K6YW|5.0|There is only one thing to say: &#34;It doesn't get any better than this&#34;.  No mayhem, no foul language and no sex.  WOW!! What were they thinking?
B000UZPIAW|5.0|Great book!!!! I have friends and family battling addiction and this has defiantly even me some insight. AWESOME BOOK!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I loved the movie when I first saw it.  As soon as I received the item, I lost no time  viewing it and loving it all over again.
B0023RSZZU|5.0|This is a story about a young girl living near Munich in Nazi Germany.  Although Liesel is the protagonist in this novel, it is the narrator who seems to speak with a writer’s voice filled with poetry.  What makes this novel even more interesting is that the narrator introduces himself as the Grim Reaper.  It turns out that as the narration unfolds, Death appears to be endowed with human feelings, a big heart and a wonderful sense of humor.  In reviewing any novel it is often the story line that holds the reader, and this is also true about this novel too.  But far more meaningful for me was the prose.  Mr. Zusak’s talent shines through the novel as he puts words together in a unique and beautiful way.  I confess I have never read an author with such a great talent for expressing words visually.  Here’s a few examples from the book.   “That was when a great shiver arrived.  It waltzed through the window with the draft.  Perhaps it was the breeze of the Third Reich, gathering even greater strength.  Or maybe it was just Europe again, breathing.  Either way, it fell across them as their metallic eyes clashed like tin cans in their kitchen.”  Here’s a description of a public book burning by the Nazis.   “The orange flames waved at the crowd as paper and print dissolved inside them.  Burning words were torn from their sentences.”  Or driving in the rain:   “The day was grey, the color of Europe.  Curtains of rain were drawn around the car.”  Or here’s another example:   “Each night she would step outside and watch the sky.  Usually it was like spillage, cold and heavy, slippery and gray; but once in a while some stars had the nerve to rise and float, if only for a few minutes.  On those nights, she would stay a little longer and wait.  ‘Hello stars.’  Waiting for mama’s voice from the kitchen.  Or till the stars were dragged down again, into the waters of the German sky.”  Here’s an example of a character description from the book:She could see his face now, in the tired light.  His mouth was open and his skin was the color of eggshells.  Whiskers coated his jaw and chin, and his ears were hard and flat.  He had a small but misshapen nose.  When the time came, he awoke with the nasty thrill of disorientation.  His mouth opened for a moment after his eyes and he sat up, right-angled.  ‘Ay!’  A patch of voice escaped his mouth.  When he saw the upside-down face of a girl above him, there was the fretful moment of unfamiliarity and the grasp for recollection---to decode exactly where and when he was currently sitting.  After a few seconds, he managed to scratch his head.  (the rustle of kindling)  and he looked at her.  His movements were fragmented, and now that they were open, his eyes were swampy and brown.  Thick and heavy.  It was late afternoon, gray and gleaming, but it was only dirty-colored light that was permitted entrance into the room.  It was all the fabric of the curtains allowed.  If you’re optimistic, think of it as bronze.”  The author is the son of a German family who lived through WWII and immigrated to Australia where he lives in Sidney.

B0075LTOR2|4.0|&#34;Producer's Picks&#34; obviously based on the star power of the cast in these individual episodes and not necessarily the quality of the script or story.
160774273X|5.0|I asked for this book for Christmas after reading and rereading reviews of it. I'm a very experienced baker who has been making bread for nearly 40 years. I've wanted to be able to make a whole grain loaf that tastes like it came from a wood-fired brick oven, but my kitchen doesn't come equipped with such amenities. Today, I tried the Saturday 75% whole wheat bread and Wow!! The crust is amazing; the flavor is incredible, and I'm ready to dive into more of the book, but even if this is the only winner, the book has already been well worth the cost.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I have been totally blown away.  The story has swept me away and I cannot wait until the next episode.
B004SRNH10|4.0|After reading all the bad reviews I was hesitant to try installing. Did end up having problems but figured out why. For some reason it says it is installing but never does. Went into where the downloads are stored and found it there uninstalled. Selected install and it installed with no problems and is now working just fine
B008N9AASC|4.0|I was hoping to see more of the thousand-hand Guan Yin dance. In other respects if was beautiful and mesmerizing.
