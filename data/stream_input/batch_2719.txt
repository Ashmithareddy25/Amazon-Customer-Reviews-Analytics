B004XWMXX8|5.0|Great Little Artist. The product is good quality. The product discribed was as indicated in the remarks. I will buy from this seller again in the future. Thanks A Million.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|For a free game, of the die-each-time-and-start-back-at-the-beginning type, it's perfect. Addicting, objectives to draw you back, and paid options are desirable but not required to succeed.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|This goes down as one of my favorite movies. The stellar cast just brings the story to life so well, and you couldn't ask for a better story. I'm not going to give any spoilers out, but if you haven't seen this film rent it now!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great. very realistic and fun loved it;  I would recommend it to other people as well awesome game. I am now addicted to it.
B008QTVNUI|3.0|This is a poor second to the show this man was in which was cancelled, called LIFE.  Homeland is highly manipulative and treds ground that has been done to death.
B0087ZG7UW|5.0|The original classic horror movie, after watching Hitchcock, we found ourselves wanting to watch the original Psycho, and loved it.. but beware.. you will never feel the same in the shower again!
B003HKN52A|5.0|What Can I say? I have loved his music since I was !6!  My Mom bought my brother an album ,as soon as it was available and listening I was Hooked. When my brother Passed away I got his collection. They were water damaged, in my cellar I was devested, dryed them out and they still sound great!
B0002VFXFE|4.0|Im happy with this product, it can drop the temp about 5 degrees of my FX 8150, i have replaced stock compound of the Corsair H80
B001GSTOAM|5.0|It has becomed my most recommended book. I think it can be the book that influenced the most my day to day work.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Makes a compelling case for life after death. If He is right this can be life changing. I would recommend this book to everyone.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|These are the Best sounding headphones I've ever owned.  Clear high end and tight low end make for a perfect combination.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Ridiculous missions. Need to read to understand what some soldiers do, are willing to do, and sometimes have to do.
B004NS710C|4.0|I enjoyed the movie. It was well done. The acting was good and the story was very good. I think they could have developed the sub plots a little more but it was good anyway.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Well written war story from a German pilots perspective. An account of how their tour of duty unfolded. The basic story of humanity was a bonus.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|Alice in chains are back for the 2nd sophomore album and it has great riffs and sound ,great feeling loved it great job guys
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I wish there were fewer ads on this site and that it was faster. Love having the forecast, complete with maps whenever I want them.
B00C2AXDAU|5.0|Made the mistake of checking this out the day after he came through town, now I hate myself for missing the show. Great album. It's been on repeat for a week now.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Fast moving story, fun and interesting. Would be worth your time to rent this one, not gross so mostly a good family movie.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Best game I played so far it was really fun. You can't find a better game. The game is designed in a good way.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I again couldn't put it down! I love the relationship between Eva and Gideon, they are two very flawed people who are determined to not let anything get in their way. After I read this I have lent the entire series to a few people and they loved them just as much! I can't wait for book 4!!
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|It keeps you thinking. Each level builds with difficulty. I haven't gotten bored yet. I can't seem to put it down !
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book is just as amazing as the first, and I couldn't wait to find out what happens next! The ups and downs make it impossible to not turn to the next page, and let's face it Gideon is HOT!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Don't like the ads so I will purchase the game and get rid of them. Ask for too many words on these reviews. I like short and sweet.
B00846REIS|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! I was skeptical at first and thought it would be just a 50 Shades knock off but truthfully this book is so much better!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is awesome and fun and if you are looking for a game that you take care of horses this is for you
B000HAB4KS|5.0|One of the few best movies I have ever seen.  I haven't watched the second and third, deliberately, because of the summaries I read.  This movie outcalssed itself.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|Was not sure how this would work.  Works perfectly to light up room long enough to reach light on other side of room. Easy installation.
B0049H9NVW|4.0|I got this game home, briefly looked through the instructions and then started looking through the pieces in the box.<br /><br />Right away, it was apparent that I was missing a piece. The panda itself was missing! This is something that you need to play the game. This seemed like such an oversight by the company that I found myself double checking, triple checking and finally quadruple checking everything to make sure that it hadn't become dislodged and was just somewhere that I couldn't see.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the little guy was nowhere to be found. Looking through the forums of boardgamegeek, I noticed that this was a problem that other people had when they opened up their game (not just the panda, other game pieces as well).<br /><br />Naturally, I returned the game for an exchange. Once I do get the new game, I'll make sure to count every single game piece to make sure that they are all there. I suggest anyone that buys this does the same.<br /><br />I'll amend my review once I can actually play the game.<br /><br />********************************************************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />As promised, I'm amending my review. I returned the game for an exchange through Amazon. Kudos to Amazon here, they shipped it overnight.<br /><br />This one had all of the game pieces, I counted each and every one just to make sure.<br /><br />Now onto the game. I've only played this game with two players with the maximum number being 4. The playing time is around 45 minutes, but sometimes games go faster.<br /><br />The story of this game is simple; the Chinese Emperor gifts the Japanese Emperor a Giant Panda to celebrate their new alliance.<br /><br />At the start of the game each person is given three objective cards, one from each category (gardener, land plot, and panda). Aptly named, these objective cards have a point value associated with them. When the objectives are met,the player can turn over the card to score the points. In a two player game the person with nine objective cards scored signals the end of the game. In a three player game this is eight cards, in a four player game it's seven. You can only have 5 objective cards in your hand at one time.<br /><br />On your turn you get two standard actions which cannot be the same. You can either:<br /><br />1. Place a Land Plot tile (there are three colors - green, yellow and pink)<br />2. Place an Irrigation Channel<br />3. Move the gardener (grows bamboo on any irrigated land plot)<br />4. Move the Panda (eats one bamboo)<br />5. Draw an objective card<br /><br />On every turn after the first, the player rolls the weather die. Results can be:<br /><br />1. Choose an extra action<br />2. Choose to place a bamboo piece on any land plot<br />3. Can choose two of the same actions<br />4. Move the panda<br />5. Add an improvement to a land plot that doesn't have any bamboo<br />6. ? - this just means that you get to choose any of the above (most of the time three actions are chosen)<br /><br />Here are some sample objectives:<br /><br />1. The panda has to eat two segments of green bamboo. This is worth three points.<br />2. The gardener plants two sections of pink bamboo three segments high. This is worth six points.<br />3. Match up two green irrigated land plot tiles and two irrigated pink land plot tiles next to each other. That's worth 4 points.<br /><br />I've glossed over some of the nuances of the rules, but I'll let you discover that during gameplay.<br /><br />Naturally, the one with the most points at the end of the game wins.<br /><br />This is a fun, short game. The rules are easy to understand, the game play comical, and all of the pieces are wonderfully designed (although the objective cards do seem a little fragile). For those that are looking for a non-violent board game, this is going to be up your alley.<br /><br />For recommended age, I think that there is a conflicting misprint. On the box it says eight and over, in the instruction manual it says thirteen and over. Although there are a few things to keep track of during the game, I don't think that it requires a player to be thirteen. Much younger kids could (and probably do) play this game.<br /><br />Overall, I found that gameplay was mostly balanced; three out of the four games that we played the total score wasn't off by that much. On the last game, I did notice that if a player was unlucky and drew too many low scoring objective cards there was no way to recover from that.<br /><br />I wonder if one of the weather die rolls should allow you to discard a card back into the draw pile - randomly of course. If you do incorporate that rule, you'd probably want to limit the number of discards that you can do.<br /><br />If this kind of game is your style, then I definitely recommend picking it up.
B00CL6GAD2|4.0|Not sure what the critics gave this, but I thought it was a great movie.  Pretty much all of Mark Wahlberg's movies lately have been good and this is no exception.
B000NY12LO|5.0|I have just started reading Jodi Picoult . I have enjoyed every one so far. This is the fifth . But this was the hardest to put down. Never before have I felt so conflicted in my feelings of sympathy for \\"the bad guy \\" or his family . This book really made me think and feel .
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Mu husband and I are watching these on Amazon Prime. They are so good! No commercials and a great story line. Can't wait for the next season!
B00BI73CVI|2.0|I just finished reading Les Miserables and was excited to see the movie. This movie got so much hype I thought it would be really good. Unfortunately I missed the mark. It lacked the emotion and power of the book.
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|This game is fun. I have played for a few days, and found it very entertaining, one of those games you like to sneak in when you have 5 or 10 minutes to spare. It's a game of skill, and learning how to cheat the \\"game approved\\" way i.e- the use of skill points. (that part is kind of irritating, because you don't know what the other side has in their bag of tricks!) seriously though- it's fun. I'd buy it.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|RED uses classic actors to produce a wonderful satire on government powers, retirement and aging global secret service agents. Such good acting and fast moving plot.
B0000027RL|5.0|What could I say about this one...classic. One of their best. Timeless. Still sounds great after all this time. Love it.
0452289963|5.0|The answers I have been seeking for years are addressed in this book. Very profound and valid information, a must read for every human
B00DHNBPA6|4.0|What I liked about the remake was that it didn't copy too much from the original & kind of did it's own thing. The story was a bit different & it took itself a bit more seriously! On top of that, there's a major twist at the end that I think will shock any hardcore Evil Dead fan. Overall, didn't hit home as hard as the original, but it was a good time! Seriously though, where's Evil Dead Part 4? Bruce isn't getting any older & I know that people would love to see him make a comeback for atleast one more final Evil Dead flick!
B00CF34B2I|4.0|This is a great game. You get some gameplay free,  but you pay 10 dollars for the full game. This is a good deal,  but you cannot play multiplayer on an old kindle fire. This is still a good deal,  I would have liked to have that I couldn't play mutilplayer before I bought it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great. The minions, the challenges and the little music and animations. I also have this app on the iPod, and it lags A LOT. In the kindle version, it never lags and is great and fun. Plus the minions are SO cute!
B004H4XI5O|5.0|A fascinating look at memories and how they are formed. It was a personal journey from a professional writer on his efforts to understand the whole complex subject of memories.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|the last episode of this season is what everyone has been waiting for and some turns that nobody expects awsome
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Loved it - the good guys were the old guys and they kicked a _ _ ! But, then again, I'm old too! LOL
0060527986|5.0|Hi Amazon<br /><br />Best feeling when you walk into the office and the admin assistant hands in the mail! Love it. Just made my morning! And this book in particular, I had 2 copies which I kept giving away and lost. This one is mine to keep now!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|After reading a few reviews of it (see below), I was rather hesitant about reading it. But, I'm glad that I did . . . and I'm anxiously waiting for the sequel! The story just goes on and on and on - and it just gets better and better and better! There's alot more to happen!
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I ordered this because I thought Read All About It was on here.  Disappointed that it was wasn't, but love the CD anyway.  There are some really great songs on this CD. Songs that sound great and also really touch you and make you think. My faves are My Kind of Love, Where I Sleep and Hope. This artist has a great voice, and I'm hoping she comes out with more music.  I would buy more music from her.
0393316041|5.0|The book arrived two days before his birthday, and when I called him on the day of, he told me he'd already finished it.  It was funny, interesting, and easy to read
0316236446|5.0|Super easy illustrations on how to draw so many fun things.  I'm having as much fun as my grandkids are with it.
1936608898|5.0|I thought I already knew a good deal about food & nutrition, and about how my own body works. This book proved me wrong. It's hard for me to put in words how glad I am to have found it.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I think I have watched this about 50 times and will watch it hundreds more.  I just love the portrayal of the characters.  My favorite movie version of the wonderful book.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|Have a box of tissues ready when reading this book! Not what I expected.<br />There are some funny moments and so many sad ones in this book. You really feel for Lou's character and for Wills for what happened to him. The ending of the book was a bit of a shock as I thought the write up of the book would have given  the characters a happy ending. I don't think the book description gave a true write up of what the story was about.  My first JoJo Moyes book that I have read and I found it okay, except for the ending which was disappointing. Lou is a strong character how she fights not just for Will but also for herself and trying to overcome her past pulls at the heartstrings.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|There apparently has been a cataclysmic event, the entire population lives inside silos as the outside is toxic. A caste system is in effect with mechanical people at the bottom and IT people near the top. There are early hints that all is not what it seems. The author stretches too many scenes out, because the only way to get anywhere in the silo is by way of a spiral staircase. This device is employed too often to \\"build tension\\" and basically just becomes tiresome. Interesting premise and some surprising twists makes for a good story.
B007M45PMU|5.0|The record was amazing. I had to listen to the whole thing twice in a row and can't wait to listen to it again.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I loved this book and I'm sorry to see this story come to an end. Hope that C. Harris changes her mind and writes another story about Sookie.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I've always enjoyed Julianne as an actress since ER, I like this character even more.  It's a great show with fascinating cases.
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|Being able to draw with grid lines of various colors and transparency is an interesting idea.  I like it but I am not really sure what to do with it but make random amorphous shapes.  Pretty and an a bit better at a little time sink than a full on artist tool.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A great game for all of the family and friends to play. I over all enjoyed the game and can't wait for more levels to come out.
B000068FY1|5.0|The Jayhawks have a small but rabid following. They had little chart success, but you can hear their influence in many current country-ish singers - Ryan Adams and etc.<br /><br />This is widely regarded as their classic album. At first (almost two decades ago!) I thought that all of the songs sounded alike...Further listening proved that the band had combined a well-developed and consistent sound with a variety of well-written songs. This really is an album that rewards repeated listening. It is probably the most-played album I own, and is in fact currently parked in my car's CD changer. It is ageless and timeless.<br /><br />If you buy it and don't like it, listen at least three times. Seriously.
B0056BMK6K|4.0|Very useful - down to earth - filled with tips and good ideas, Easy to read and simple plan to follow.
B001BR7CZW|1.0|We streamed two other prime movies, but for some reason, we cannot stream Blues Brothers. After 2 hours we were able to watch 24 minutes of the movie. Frustrating and no option to contact amazon about this... be careful what you stream, not all are the same quality apparently!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Well done drama. I really enjoyed watching the whole series, and still have 5 episodes to go. Sometimes I miss what they are saying, partly because of the british Accents. Would recommend to anyone!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I like this game! It is a fun game. Try it you might like it! minions are funny and cute!
B009WUBERW|1.0|glad i did not have to spend money on this god was it awful highly recommend not to watch waste of time
B00DHNAQ2Y|5.0|Been wanting to see this movie since seeing the previews for the first time. One of the best horror films I've seen, ever
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. His life is a inspiration to all of us . Amazing!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I really like it I spent a long time looking for a free search and find game for a long time and all I could ever find were previews to very expensive games.
B0031RSA24|5.0|This book has given many of my preexisting thoughts a scientific backing, whereas before some of my personal concepts about religion and god simply flowed from my loose knowledge of Darwinian concepts but mostly from my exasperation towards &#34;some&#34; attitudes, prejudices, irrational rules, meaningless ceremonies etc. etc. from otherwise decent people. This I direct at many people I have met and continue to meet that consider themselves believers and I have them down as lovely people regardless of our differences, and I sincerely hope they feel the same about me and my family. My message to them is that one does not choose to &#34;not&#34; believe in a god and there is no forcing it.<br />It has also opened my eyes to many new angles and subjects, firmly strengthening my already &#34;no proof-no fairy&#34; approach to all matters involving religion, blind-faith and not least to, sometimes embarrassing, evidently skewed views of very dubious proof in favor of an impossible.<br />Great read - Loved it !.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game. It is not too easy. It actually makes you think. Anyone who likes puzzles and challanges will love this game!!!
B005LAIH2M|5.0|By far, this movie is one of the BEST movies  I have viewed this year.<br />I recommend it to all of my friends.<br />Keep in mind... This is not a movie for kids.  Hence, the &#34;R&#34; rating.
B000I9X53W|5.0|Each scene is very crafty and gives an amazing prospective to what getting a job based upon your looks really means to the entertainment industry.
B0016CVN02|5.0|One of my favorite albums growing up. My pops used to play it on vinyl everyday. Had to buy it.
B001KZG99A|5.0|This part was made for Robert Downey Jr! Gwenth Paltrow, Terrance Howard were the icing on the cake. Roberts' sexy long eye lashes, his smile and his amazing acting abilities never stops amazing me. Bravo
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I got ti for free but really it's worth a dollar at least.I eespecially like the crescendo and the snooze and dismissal options.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Great games but it gets boring after a wile but when you update it all 35 times it rocks!!<br />you got to buy it. :-)
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|My 10 yr old loved this movie and the zombie aspect even had my husband watching! Great movie for adults and tweens!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|While some characters seem so daft at times, the show is fun and interesting. It was worth the watch and we are looking forward to season four.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Beautifully written, and heartily narrated... Hope this will happened to every person that goes through with this... A ray of hope is always needed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game was great until it deleted from my apps. My kindle was lagging and it had pressed remove from device. I backed out from it and it still said it was there but it wouldnt open so i had to reinstall it.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|I first read this book as a sophomore in high school and truly loved this book.  Reading it a second time after 5 years has only strengthened my adoration and genuine enlightenment for Arthur C. Clarke`s work. His incredible ability to take you through the obstacles of mankind`s growth under the supervision of a superior alien race while intimately expressing the emotional struggles of not only an individual but even more so the human race as a whole really makes the book flourish in brevity that will leave you with a humbling yet awe-inspiring perspective of the galaxy let alone the world.
B00DU73T08|4.0|Great freakin film!! I will own this movie on Blu-Ray!!y girlfriend and I really enjoyed this! Been telling my friends about it!!
1615890122|1.0|Do not buy any books by Megalodon Entertainment, LLC they are full of errors. As an ex-English professor who suffered a massive stroke 10 years ago. It took me several years to learn to read again. There's nothing worse than buying a book that's filled with errors.<br /><br />Sincerely, Ralph Edsell<br /><br />rjedsell@sbcglobal.net
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|What a powerful story of a brave boy! I'll be reading this book to my boys! Everyone needs to be taught to be Kinder than Necessary!
B0012QRPU4|5.0|I love the Breaking Bad series because the acting is superb and the writing is outstanding.  The characters are each consistent in their vulnerabilities.  The concept of a mild chemistry teacher slowly changing to meet new challenges is very exciting.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|If this movie had not two or three of my favorite stars, it would have been a complete loser in my mind.  It seemed to stretched things that should have been compacted.  Okay movie if you have nothing to do.  By having Jennifer Lawrence(Hunger Games) and Bradley Cooper as the main storyline, I was able to watch the entire movie.
B009MYARIK|5.0|Sophie Kinsella does not disappoint in Wedding Night.  I find myself cringing as her character speaks. You want to save her the heartache.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This book kept me up late at night when I would come to a part of the book that I just had to find out what happens next.  And there were many of these.  Great book in the Reacher series or any series.
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|Most horror movies suck but this one wasn't that bad. If you like blood and guts this is for you.
0783225849|1.0|I could not play this copy in any machine I own, new or old. Was not happy with this product
B009NQZVKG|3.0|For fans of Sigma Force, it's a pleasure to continue learning more about the main characters and see where they're headed. This outing is more about character development than it is about plot. The ideas Rollins throws out are fun until reaching the overly melancholy ending. Wish he had gone in a different direction.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Just a huge fan of Jane Austen! Love that everything always works out. This version of Emma was very good as thought the actors matched the characters well. Great movie!
B00AQ71FLK|3.0|This game is time consuming but, I wish you can stick with one character throughout the game. Other then that, pretty good game.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Blake Shelton doesn't disappoint on this one either.  I have all his CDs and they just keep getting better and better.
B00D6SBOWG|4.0|This game is for older children and adults of all ages.<br />This game is fun, entertaining but also a challenge. The gopher adds great fun and a new twist to solitair.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|if it wasn't for the book club I probably would not have read this book.  We had a good discussion on whether the husband was selfish or in denial.  Most thought selfish only interested in his own career.  I would recommend it to others.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Just install, then search for the video you want. Touch the entry you want until the pop-up menu is displayed and choose your option. Love this app.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Great game to play when taking a dump. Helps pass the time when you are bored or when your not bored. This is a must have.
B005V5WBFG|5.0|Nice user experience. Many security applications in one suite. Same product works well across mobile devices. Overall good product. Will love to see some more features.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I have had excellent service with Seiko watches for over 40 years and this watch is a fine everyday sharp looking watch.  Unlike other brand automatic watches, it doesn't stop running overnight or even up to 12 -14 hours of inactivity.  I really like the simple classic lines of the watch and the strap fits just the way I like it. I recommend this product and the Amazon service was prompt as usual.
B001N3UO68|4.0|Kurt Russell does very well in this part in an action film that moves along briskly.  Probably best part since his iconic escape from NY or his Wyatt Earp in Tombstone--where Val Kilmer streals the show as Doc Holliday.  However, I have enjoyed Kurt Russell in Big Trouble in Little China (his homage to John Wayne), and Captain RTon is funr to watch before you go to the beach, especially in the Caribbean<br />Well written with a great ensemble cast, lovely Haille Berry, many familiar faces, mostly seen on small screen, and creative pairing with Stevan Segal in one of Mr Segal's most effective parts.
B005544V6A|5.0|I missed &#34;Suits&#34; when it debuted several seasons ago....I'm delighted to be able to catch up now with a really intelligent show that is always entertaining.  It is so much better than the offerings of this season!!  I find the current season's so-called &#34;Hits&#34; dull and boring.
B009ZQTD7Q|5.0|This movie has become a favorite of mine; Jane Eyre as a novel is wonderful, but it needed an editor... This movie removes the frivolous, long-winded parts of the book and does a masterful job portraying the 'core' of the work.  Lovely soundtrack, scenery, and dialogue abound.  The characters are believable, and performances are well-done.
1401938906|5.0|I started reading the Chapter about Dude Abides Principle. I only read through half of the chapter on Saturday evening. I knew I was supposed to receive a \\"thumbs up\\" that the FP exists but never fully got through the chapter about giving it intention and deadlines. On Sunday morning (prior to reading the full chapter) my neighbor was having a garage sale and was giving away a pool table and wash bucket. Pool table would've been cool but it wasn't quite in the condition I would've liked. But I was looking for a wash bucket and although very shabby, took it home. That evening I finished the chapter and gave FP a deadline of Wednesday evening to make its presence known. Monday morning, I walk out, and there is that shabby beat up wash bucket in front of my door. I got chills... than suddenly thought of the pool table that I CHOSE not to bring home. I'm not gonna lie, I felt so overwhelmed with emotion and gratitude that I got teary eyed and thanked the universe for being so wonderful to me, because it has been the last few years. Doesn't matter that my \\"gift\\" would've cost less than $100. It's the fact that when I walked out onto my doorstep at 9am... it was sitting there, as if always there, and completely unexpectedly. And the pool table... that flipped over to become an air hockey table. I CHOSE not to bring it home... although it presented itself to me quite unexpectedly after a beautiful morning jog. NEVER wrote a review on amazon before... but was so excited about my experiment that I was compelled to share my experience. AND... although pam says to leave all your doubts at the door I couldn't help but think \\"... will it happen to ME\\" and it has.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|The masterpiece book &#34;The Help&#34; by Kathryn Stockett was wonderful, and this book is a brilliant adaptation.  True to the book for the most part, it captures the life and soul of the characters.  One of the best movies in a very long time.
B00BC24NT4|4.0|The action in A Delicate Truth springs from post-September 11 anti-terrorism activities. It's a good story, put together well, and moves along at just the right pace. The characterization was a bit weak, but the plot and the depiction of bureaucratic diplomacy were convincingly disillusioning.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Yep, I'm hooked on this game....love, love it....very interactive and just love the witch that goes across your screen when you win or lose.  Play several times a day....Didn't know spiders could be so &#34;cute&#34;.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoy this game but not enough levels I miss playing it. I hope. They get other. Levels soon.
B005NHQ2NY|5.0|I bought other Atkins books years ago (Atkins diet revolution, Atkins first two weeks made easy), but although I read them cover to cover, I didn't really &#34;get it&#34;.<br /><br />This book is much easier to read, it explains things better, gives more examples and breaks it all down into manageable bits of information.  It has also been updated and contains information that the previous books do not.<br /><br />I finally realised where I had gone wrong in my previous attempts on the Atkins diet.  It was an eye opener!<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to try a low-carb diet.<br />If you have previously purchased the older Atkins books, like I did, you DEFINITELY need to buy this one and read it.<br /><br />I also recommend looking around for other books on low-carb diets, and read them in conjunction with this Atkins book.  It really helps and they give great tips for losing weight and breaking through a plateau where your weight-loss has stopped or really slowed down ...<br />A good one is &#34;Low Carb Strategies you don't know about&#34; by Susan J Campbell
B002VECLVY|5.0|Finally got around to seeing this movie, and when I did I had to have it for my library, it is an absolute masterpiece and Collin Firth is amazing!
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|I play this while sitting in my car, and it is awesome! As others have, said, it takes some getting used to since they do not explain everything about the game. However, you do start to understand as you go on.<br /><br />Definitely start on the lowest difficulty until you get points for a couple powers, and don't feel afraid to try out the different game modes. I have been playing for a few days, and although I've bumped up to normal a few times, I'm still playing easy to get another power first.<br /><br />So have fun and get linking!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I love minions!!!!!<br /><br />the voice work was fantastic, the characters are awesome, and..... minions.....<br /><br />oh, and Gru's mom is straight out of a Gary Larson cartoon
B005WUHAX8|4.0|I have used my phne in the pool and it worked great.  No leaks.  The disadvantage is it is slightly harder to press buttons when texting.  Overall it is a great cover and protection for my phone
B005HEVBGG|5.0|I love all Star Trek but Voyager is my favorite.<br />It comes through great and no commercials.<br />Thanks Amazon :)
148951418X|5.0|I bought this book after subscribing to him on youtube.  The book really lays it out for you and helps you get familiar with your camera.
B00BBW15R8|5.0|If you enjoy relationship movies that are well directed and well acted, than watch this one!  Best movie I've seen in a while.
0736041850|5.0|This is a classic. I bought it to add to my collection it has great info and illustrations. Great book.
B00B5AP7NY|5.0|My kids watch it over and over. They always find something new in the movie.<br />The price went down by ship date, so the price that I was charged was adjusted down.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|It embodies the characteristics of a typical 80's film. Many aspects of it are outdated and that's what makes it iconic and great to watch. I recommend it to anyone who loves a good film and enjoys watching something unique and genuine from a cast.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I watch this movie so many times.<br />Truly beautiful music, enchanting and lovely.<br />Period piece, that made me wish,  I could step back in time.<br />A must. See!
0679731725|4.0|When \\"The Remains of the Day\\" begins, Mr. Stevens decides to embark on a journey, ostensibly to take a break from his duties, but really to see who in his heart knows to be his soulmate -- a former housemaid who has left her position in order to marry and raise a family, something that was always beyond Mr. Stevens' imagination.  Mr. Stevens had served his lord for decades, and when the novel begins, his lord had long been disgraced and died for his fascist sympathies, and Mr. Stevens has been reduced to as a quaint English novelty by his new American overlord.<br /><br />As a narrator, Mr. Stevens is just as unreliable as he is long-winded, more prone to empty abstract philosophizing than to clear and sharp observations.  He wonders often what a perfect butler looks and feels like, and wonders if he had indeed achieved that ideal -- which was to serve loyally and competently his Lord.  And Mr. Stevens rambles on for dozens of pages to prove to himself that he had indeed done so, and thus his life had been worth living.<br /><br />When Mr. Stevens finally confronts his soulmate who had fled his grasp, it is not to leap at the possibility of love and happiness that had always eluded the reserved and reticent servant, but to see if she is willing to return with him to serve.  She is not, and while she knows she once truly and passionately loved Mr. Stevens she has also learned to love herself -- and that was perhaps why she arranged the meeting after so many years apart.<br /><br />Alas, everything escapes Mr. Stevens, and he returns home determined to better serve his new Lord, to better adapt himself to his new reality.<br /><br />\\"Remains of the Day\\" is a novel about a man who steadfastly refuses to live for himself, to even think of himself.  It is a story of a perpetual and willing slave, and the sadness and evil that ensues because of his inability to make decisions for himself and to pass judgement of right and wrong.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Classic movie. Whats not to like? Great movie to watch with the family. Hope hollywood doesnt try to do a remake.
159463176X|5.0|wow it really opens your eyes about the people in afganistan and pakistan.most are so innocent.. Love anything he writes
B0085FF55W|5.0|Family of the Year, a band going places, has a great collection of alternative rock tunes on this cd. I LOVE these songs!
B000VSAEYI|4.0|Great pool - main problem (reason for 4 instead of 5 stars) is the floor doesn't inflate so it requires a mat or something soft (like grass) under the floor.  I use it on a roof deck.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|I am not an action or marvel fan! I have never read a marvel comic in my life! I did my hubby a favor and watched this movie with him at the theater. This movie had a good amount of action, not overstuffed with annoying noisiness. Special effects were awesome! I hardly find anything funny in most movies, but this one made bust out loud many times!!!! Not sure what\\"s going on with these bad reviews! A movie about a book or magazine will always disappoint someone's homemade imagination. If you can't deal with that, don't go to a movie based on a book or comic!
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|What good does a Help Guide do you if you cannot play the game.  Why would you make a Help Guide App available without the game.  Useless!!
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|Super fun EP, can't wait for more stuff from Lorde.  Every song is catchy.  I guess you could liken it to pop music, but it's so much more than that.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The latest update on TWC app on my kindle fire is awful.  The ads are everywhere.  If i tap on the wrong place, they pop up and its tough to get out of them.  Im addicted to weather so Im sad that this has happened.
1613821395|5.0|Nora Ephran's favorite book...so far quite interesting. Well written thanks!!!*******  My books cover is different, picture of the woman in white!!  Same story
B004P4S4NM|5.0|Every song is great to listen to and her voice is strong and powerful. Everyone will enjoy her music and talent
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|This is a lot of fun to play and make it what you want. It is very user-friendly so you can change what you want when building. The only drawback is it can get costly to play since you have to have game dollars to do certain actions. I'm not patient enough to wait the time periods they put on things.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is a great way to keep track of notes, ideas, lists, quotes, websites, projects, etc. You name it, you can Evernote it. Clipping from the internet is a great feature.
B0025YKDJC|3.0|This was another one of the so so comedies of Jim Carrey. It was plenty funny but not a great movie. He played his same old role and it was what i expected from Carrey.
B00065GX64|5.0|This was a well done movie, the actors did not over exaggerate movement or acting.. M is a marvel and a head of its time..
B006TF6WAM|4.0|A lovely explanation of how life can change if you do something unexpected, and courageous, and the importance of old connections.
B008220BLG|5.0|Ummm hello ... when have you ever fallen for a zombie? Never, right? Well this movie totally changes that. R is such a great character. I loved him so much. You could see him trying so hard to communicate with her and make her comfortable in his environment. He even had a sense of humor. It was cool to see a movie where humans and zombies start to interact, therefore creating a miracle (don't want to spoil that part). I laughed ALOT, cried a few times, got extremely fustrated at a point or two, and overall just felt good inside watching it.<br /><br />The music was amazing as well. I, of course, downloaded 90% of the songs while I was watching it.<br /><br />Watch it and own it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It was interesting and does keep you reading but not in some parts  it was good though and I'm happy for katniss she  stayed in my opining with the best guy who also convinced her to have children! So if you get it have fun reading and find out!
B00BVVA138|5.0|I cannot get enough of this record! I've been playing it non-stop for weeks now and it doesn't get old.  A great way for Jesse to return to the band.
B0094M6A18|5.0|I had already seen it a few times. I was disappointed to purchase it in HD only to realize it wouldn't play on my laptop in HD so I opted to watch the regular version and shut it off after about 20 minutes because the quality was so bad.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|I'm afraid my ancient mind can't keep up with the scene changes.  Made myself watch the movie and had a hard time of it but it did explain why the novel jumped around.  I couldn't finish the novel.  Sorry.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love the sound and visual effects.  The minion rush is hysterical and addictive.  I am a beginner and need to practice more before I become a truly despicable minion.
B00BN3DPQ4|5.0|Movie was just plain fun.  Arnold has not lost his touch for humor.  This is not a mega-hit, but it is entertaining.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like that I don't have to be online to play this and can be anwhere and play on the kindle.  It has a bunch of different settings, like vegas style, etc but will show you how the game could have been won if you reach a deadlock and can't figure anymore moves out.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is better than energy<br /><br />Minecraft is the world of crafting<br /><br />And the best game ever<br />You should have it
B0015DWJ8W|4.0|Quirky and interesting especially if you are a Murakami fan. I enjoyed his reflections on the interplay of writing and running.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I tried everything I could possibly think of to get started...and nothing worked.  Finally I gave up and deleted the game!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book has everything.  History, politics, great characters, and zombies.  It catches your attention from the very first chapter.  I have purchased this book several times to give to friends and relatives, and even if they aren't into zombie fiction, they have loved it.<br /><br />Please give this very well written book a try.  You won't be dissapointed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is one one my favorite games....cant stop playing this game. keep up the good work. cant wait to see the update.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Riveting. Hard to stop reading. Just when you think you know where things are headed, something happens to take you on a new and exciting ride in a totally different direction. Keeps you thinking, trying to figure out what's next. But all you can do is follow along as Suzanne Collins keeps you intrigued. A definite must read sequel!
B00835UW4S|5.0|...so I haven't actually opened it to inspect it. The packaging seems to be in excellent shape, so I am confident the rest of the item is fine. Shipping packaging was well done.<br /><br />Thanks!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was incredibly moving and quite a nice surprise despite feeling a bit too young adult for my usual taste. Have a box of tissues on hand for the ending.
B000000ZGN|5.0|...so I haven't actually opened it to inspect it. The packaging seems to be in excellent shape, so I am confident the rest of the item is fine. Shipping packaging was well done.<br /><br />Thanks!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I don't even know where to begin with this book. It was AMAZING and I cannot believe how long I've put it off.<br /><br />I began reading this book with no prior knowledge of anything other than the main character's name and what I read in the summary which was the best thing I could have done when reading it. I was taken on twists and turns that I wasn't expecting, I found myself with so many goosebumps after the end of almost every chapter. That's what I need in a book, to not ever get bored for even a second.<br /><br />Thomas' character was very interesting too. I never once suspected he helped design the maze but I did think he had SOMETHING to do with the Creators. It blew me away to know that him and Teresa were part of the designers and how they knew so much and that it took Thomas to go through The Changing just to remember everything. Which also... was freaky and creeped me.<br /><br />The Changing and the Grievers seriously gave me the chills and I had to stop reading at one point so I didn't wig out in the middle of the night. I was so shocked when Thomas went through with getting stung. He's so self sacrificing which also made me realize that I hate knowing Dylan O'Brien is playing Thomas because I kept thinking about how Stiles Stilinski like Thomas was and comparing their characters and it just makes me even more excited for the movie!<br /><br />My favorite character by far though was Chuck and it made me so mad when he died I almost through my Nook out the window and I'm not exaggerating. The kid was so likeable and looked up to Thomas so much and then he ran in front of the knife for him so Thomas could survive and I can't with that. I needed him to live!<br /><br />All in all, it took me two full nights and a few quick reads to finish this book and I can tell you it will take you on a ride that you will not believe. I'm in the middle of reading the Scorch Trials because this book as me on my toes at all times and hasn't let me down once. Definitely a must read for everyone! Definitely 5 out of 5 stars for me!
B002BEJ3BK|5.0|...so I haven't actually opened it to inspect it. The packaging seems to be in excellent shape, so I am confident the rest of the item is fine. Shipping packaging was well done.<br /><br />Thanks!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I certainly enjoy this app.  I have trouble sleeping and this app is my sanity.  I certainly do use it every night.  Louis
B005FISBTO|5.0|I would recommend this to adults only as there is a lot of violence and not recommended for children It is a wonderful series and very entertaining
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book!  Just when you think you've got it figured out, there's another twist or turn.  The author does a fantastic job of describing the relationship dynamics and then allowing them to play out.  I was glued from beginning to end!
B00005R2IS|5.0|Mad max what a classic I would recommend this movie to anyone who love mel gibson it is in his early days but would watch before letting primary school children to watch as there is violence
B000JMKQX0|1.0|This book reads like a boring sterile report of apocalyptic events. People say reading a book before you see a movie will give you better insight and understanding of the story, in this case I say skip the book.  Spare yourself the boredom.  I generally read a book in two to seven days.  This book puts me to sleep in three pages tops.  The format is set up to be a series of interviews of peoples experiences to tell a story.  None of the characters get developed enough to keep an emotional tie or connection to the reader. BORING!
B005LAJ212|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone who love mystery, murder, sex and revenge it is great series and can not wait until season 2 it out
B00004UEDQ|5.0|This film is raw with realism as it follows the experience a young woman living the recovery process in a drug rehabilitation facility. This however doesn't stop it from being extremely humorous at times. The great acting and script has the capacity to engage and entertain a wide audience. Addicts, relatives of addicts, therapists and people who know nothing about addiction will all take away something good from watching this film. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I hope they keep Downton Abbey going for years to come!  Great show.  Each character becomes apart of your family, very well done.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is totally awesome and so much fun. Will deffinitly  recommend to friends. I look forward to playing this game more!!
B00CW6DAKC|3.0|FUN game please fix glitches. Have had many problems with recent version. For example I am having to reload every thirty seconds or so because something is out of sync. Also, have had to buy land expansion twice now but when the game is reloaded my land and money is gone. My juice machine and a few of my crops are now missing because they were placed on the new land I purchased. Also I was able to play as the main neighbor on their farm as well as on my neighbors farms because of a glitch when returning back to my home farm after visiting my neighbors.I guess the server thought my farm was my neighbors farm. PLEASE FIX. until it is fixed I will have to stop playing (which is sad because I got pretty far).
B008BQ8YHQ|3.0|It's too shallow as far as the characters and the plots. It is certainly no Boston Legal or The Good Wife.  Too light for me.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Long load times to show the video and then it freezes; so disappointing that this game was recommended by Amazon but it doesn't even work well on the Kindle Fire.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|It is no longer reliable source of weather information now it's all sensational crap like bloody sharks and ridiculous feeds. uninstalled!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I jumped on this box set for my collection and haven't looked back.  I loved these movies when they came out and I love them more than that I have a killer box set for them.  The included features and great and the quality is what I've come to expect.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this set for any avid blu-ray collector.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I agree with all the other reviewers who are unhappy with the recent update. This was a great app until this update made it virtually worthless!
B00D5CENXA|5.0|This short story was amazing. I enjoyed the ending especially. Karen is a talented writer. I look foward to more stories
B00A81NFAS|5.0|Love this movie!! Not for younger children, but lighthearted and great cast. Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper really compliment each other.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the characters and the story line. This season has a lot of surprises and sad moments... Can't wait for the next season!
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Great just use cloud and u have material from movies photos wallpaper. Books music easily accessable to ur devvice.available nonlinear or off line
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I want to just stay up all night and watch the whole series.  Ordered season 3, can't want for season 4!
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My granddaughter doesn't seem to get tired of playing these Dr. Panda apps.  I recommend this app for young ones.
1594204217|4.0|Thoreau went to Walden Pond to \\"front only the essentials of things,\\" felling the trees, building his cabin, growing his rows of beans, and catching the trout he prepared and ate.  His book, \\"Walden,\\" weaves into each day's work the meditations on our individual, social, political, and economic lives that were transformative then as well as now.<br /><br />In \\"Cooked,\\"  Michael Pollan continues his meditations on our individual, social, political, and economic lives as they intersect with food. Many of us felt as if a new sun had risen in \\"The Botany of Desire\\" and \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma.\\"  His subsequent books such as \\"In Defense of Food\\" and \\"Food Rules\\" have helped make Pollan an international celebrity, and his ideas widely known, often accepted, usually with the adjective \\"influential.\\"<br /><br />\\"Cooked\\" aims, Pollan writes, \\"to recover the reality of food, to return it to its proper place in our lives, by attempting to master the physical processes by which it has been traditionally made. (p 17).  In baking our own bread, roasting or braising our own meats, fermenting our own kimchee, for example, we will bond with our family as they gather in the kitchen, have personal gifts for appreciative friends, offer our communities the old-time feasts that bring us together, and re-balance Frankenfoods with our hand-made foods.<br /><br />Right on, Michael: that's a fine purpose and in itself reason to buy this book and to give of our precious time perusing of it. Much is well-written, entertaining, amusing, and nourishing to the insatiably curious mind. (Four recipes are included in an appendix but this is not a cook-book.)<br /><br />Yet, \\"Cooked\\" has elements of a reader's dilemma.<br /><br />--Despite the deep concerns about & rejection of almost all restaurant and store prepared foods, many of the featured foods are commercial products. Examples include two barbecue restaurants in the Carolinas, a chapter on an almost obessive effort to reproduce a commercial baker's loaf, deep study of food in an uber-upscale restaurant in Spain, and a year of personal cooking classes from a professional chef, for example.<br /><br />There is almost no just folks good home cooking although one could imagine much the same book organized around the fire, water, earth, and air of parents, extended family, friends,and kids in real kitchens. There are great home cooks in almost any neighborhood.<br /><br />--Two books seems stitched together in \\"Cooked.\\".  One book is carefully researched & documented scientific/technical information such as the essays on evolutionary development, current genetic diversity, and functions of those fine fungi, the yeasts, to whom we are indebted for bread and beer. Another essay series honors the bacteria, of which, says Pollan, we should eat more and be less afraid.<br /><br />The other book is composed of the stories of Michael with many well-known chefs & producers, such as Sister Noelle making artisanal raw-milk cheese and the fascinating Ed Mitchell, king of the whole-pig barbecue. In New York City, after a brief but intense appenticeship, Pollan shows his impressive barbecue chops to thousands while Mitchell entertains the multitudes.<br /><br />Good fun & grand stories, highly informative &, one hopes, scientifically correct thanks to the properly acknowledged research assistants.  It's entertaining, stimulating, enriching as part of the Pollan oeuvre.  But the two themes of human and biological, technical, and cultural are not as well integrated as in, say, \\"Walden,\\" or the luminous, numinous \\"Mark Twain's Feast\\" in its chapters on possum barbecue & maple sugaring, or Pollan's own earlier books.<br /><br />So, for readers who are new to Pollan, \\"Cooked\\" a fine introduction.  Readers who are appreciative of his work as a whole probably will want to understand his arguments on home-made vs store brought.  Readers who tend to value taut editing, skillful integration, and perhaps a bit more moving on, may applaud the intent of \\"Cooked\\" yet hope Pollan's next book will have more of the crackling. I'm glad I read \\"Cooked\\" and join others in anticipating Book #8.  Bill Bryson is on a roll and so surely can someone as clear-thinking, passionate, and gifted as Michael Pollan.
B00DYTKKGI|1.0|It's ok at first but you have to pay to get all of your tools. If you don't get the rest of the tools you only get a 50%  rating.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I thought this novel held the reader's attention and was well written. great suspense and I felt somewhat invested with the characters.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|It is an easy read. It has some good story lines and I enjoyed the premise of it so I bought the other books.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is the best series I have watched in a long time. I was sorry to see it end... Can anyone tell me if a season 4 is in the works? Loved, loved, loved it~!!!!!!
B00479SVBU|5.0|I've gone through my share of Car FM Transmitters and was relieved to see this one work so well.  It seems like just about all of these type devices come with some static, but ive yet to have a single static moment with this in over a month.  It's definitely worth the money go get this and not some cheap version at the local walmart.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|Why do I have to write a comment? I thought the movie was good. Watch it if you like scifi...
B005ZCXPP0|3.0|This movie is OK! Just that. Kids would appreciate it more than adults. The newer Avenger movies are better I think. I could be wrong.  [[ASIN:B005ZCXPP0 B005ZCXPP0]]
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Film was great.  Unfortunately, the film kept getting interrupted by multiple downloading. Then, the film stopped and it went to the Roku icon. The viewing process was not seamless, to say the least.<br />This never happens with Netflix, so it's not my TV etc. Amazon has to do a better job of providing service.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|Disjointed movie that looks like they made it up as they were filming.  Franco was terrible. Kunis too. Thank god I didn't go to theater to watch this ponderous flick. Save your money!
B00AHHODH2|5.0|The character development in this book is incredibly rich. The author introduced me to the entire town of Savannah, Georgia, and being privy to everyone's gossip, which reads hypnotically, I felt I knew as much about the people in the town as if I had lived there my whole life.<br /><br />The book is unique because it is an epic case of the pot calling the kettle black--in the beginning of the story, I was led to believe that everyone was a bunch of honest, upstanding, well-meaning and well-mannered citizens. As the story progressed, slowly, layers peeled away from everyone that detailed they were not what they appeared on the surface. Everyone lies, gossips, backstabs, there is murder, theft, and infidelity. The city's leaders, upstanding fathers, loving wives, no one is innocent--this book provides a stark look at the self-serving side of human nature, and elaborates on the mad extent to which people will cheat others to further their personal goals, with a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor.<br /><br />The book is loaded with twists and turns as characters' personalities are revealed, blurring the lines between hero and villain. Just when I thought I could trust someone, I was shocked to learn what they did; just when I thought someone couldn't possibly be more appalling, I learned something about them that made me incredibly sympathetic.<br /><br />On top of a wonderfully complex cast, everyone's stories intersect in intriguing ways--there is serendipity, there are misunderstandings, and all the magic of coincidence that evokes the saying, \\"It's a small world.\\"<br /><br />There are some excellent slices of life in the story: Thelma's death was especially touching (reminded me of my own grandmother's passing), and I thoroughly enjoyed the travels through Paris and Argentina.<br /><br />This book was an adventure and time well-spent. I hope to see more novels from Mr. Whitehead in the future!
B004HWYTP4|4.0|We really enjoyed watching the movie.  It had some great laughs and loved seeing all the cities that were visited in the movie.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This is probably my favorite game on my Kindle Fire. I have almost no problem with this game except it can get hard to play around round 78 if you have lots of towers. The only thing I dislike, not that it makes me hate the game at all, is how rarely the game is updated in the Kindle Store. My brother has a Nook HD, and can access the Google Play Store. He has the Fireworks map and the Get Monkey Money button, but I sadly do not. I did get the Jungle maps by going to the Bloons Tower Defence 5 store page and hit the Update button. Now, when I go there, I only see an Open button. Ninja Kiwi, please put the update in the Kindle Store!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|One of the best parts are the new cartoons that come with this and you can't beat the price.  Very cute.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|It keeps your crap together easily like other file managers are complicated but this is easy best file manager ever.
B0070UFMOW|3.0|Sounds great. A couple of irritating quirks: the power saver setting is not retained when power is cycled, or when it goes into power save mode (ironically). You end up with a dead battery a lot because of this. Menu times out within a second or so when your trying to change settings.<br /><br />Really needs a better solution than a giant rubber band to attach to your phone/ipod<br /><br />An iphone 5 LOD or Galaxy S3/S4 USB to go cable are no where to be found

B008PCVGKI|3.0|Bad Pharma is a sequel of sorts from the author of [[ASIN:0865479186 Bad Science: Quacks, Hacks, and Big Pharma Flacks]] an original piece about poor scientific process, across a variety of fields.<br /><br />Pharma on the other hand lampoons the pharmaceutical industry (I bet you didn't guess from the name) targeting biased publishing trends, dodgy marketing tactics, and misinformed regulators (amongst other concerns) including his own ideas on solutions and prevention.<br /><br />Unlike many polemics Goldacre's solutions are well thought out and mostly doable (mostly!) and this is certainly a strength of the book.<br /><br />In content the book is mostly frightening in the revelations of so much bias and poor science in the medicine industry. Although it is worth noting that many of the concerns outlined, while important are more looking at the refining of medication not gross negligence (for example its not like big pharma are throwing deadly drugs at us for huge prices, simply not putting as much effort into securing 1-2% differences in drug effects, or working hard to reduce side effects as much as they could.)<br /><br />So: Important message, solid evidence and useful advice, why do I rate this book so low?<br /><br />I confess that underneath the facts, this book is boring. Even though this stuff is really important, ultimately the presentation feels like an author indulging in their special interest rather than trying to entertain (Goldacre assured us this was 'pop' science!) After the first 100 or so pages the examples began to blend into one, and the arguments while compelling in content, wilted in writing.<br /><br />So ultimately this book is for the brave and interested, I think most people in this day and age have a fair amount of cynicism towards the pharma industry in general so specifics may not have as much appeal as Bad Science had in dissolving our eager beliefs in hackery.
B0070Z4M4I|5.0|Great prequel!!  I loved the subtle tie-ins to the 80's version.  Don't want to say to much so I don't spoil it.  Definitely recommend this movie.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|A little hard to get started but once involved I was kept entertained all the way to the end....and then some.  Great summer read!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Four words. I love this book. It's absolutely amazing. I would not mess with any other dictionary. This one has it all.
B0086213XW|1.0|Not much to say.  I thought this movie had so much potential with the cast but my fiancee and I had to turn it off because we were bored out of our minds.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|It's rare you come across a book that departs from the formula of 'protagonist and girl defeat the antagonist after harrowing battle' structure that saturates all of our media entertainment. Call me weird but having a main character actually die, someone you've invested in the story, just sparks my interest even more! Damocles sword adds a thrill  that really hooks me to this story.<br />But, the book ... A great concept. Society (civilization?) in a mason jar. Howey packs corruption, love, death, castes, justice, conspiracies, hope, fear into a 130+ floor tube buried in the sand that is the final home of humanity after an unknown, world-ending Armageddon. Occupants have forgotten what life was before, any and everything outside. The past is some fading pictures of strange animals (like butterflies) they see in children's books. But an elitist few know the real story. And like those generations before them, they do ANYTHING it takes to protect their secret about the toxic wasteland and corroding skyline seen in the distance.<br />Not the best review but the book is so good, I don't want to give away too much. Discover it yourself!
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|I read The Godfather book when it was first published and I saw the first movie when it was showing at the theater and I thought it was fabulous.  I recently researched all things The Godfather - from the book to the three movies made.  I was hooked - it took me three weeks to watch the three movies because I kept rewinding scenes over and over and looking at my printouts and notations on those printouts until my who-what-when-where-why and sometimes how questions were answered.  I searched high and low for any and all information on the scripts, actors, filming sites etc.  Then I read the book again and again.  This may sound trite after all these years but this book is simply superb - it takes you to a world that I know nothing about and makes me understand it.  I loved it then and I love it now.

B00B7PIRIE|5.0|If you've never watched this series, this is the perfect way to catch up, especially since the fourth season is slated to start in November 2013. If you are a fan of DOWNTON ABBEY already, then purchasing this series would give you the opportunity to watch the series again and catch things that you might have missed the first time you watched it.<br /><br />There are so many great actors in this series. Two actors most recognized by Americans are Maggie Smith and Shirley McClaine. You will learn to love some characters and totally abhor others. But you definitely well enjoy the entire series as it takes you through the lives of memorable characters and events beginning with the sinking of the Titanic.

B0034G4ORC|5.0|There are some outstanding movies out there in the Space/Sci-fi. gendre.  Star Wars, Star-Trek, 2001 to name a few.  I feel this movie rates highly when compared to those movies.  The storyline is well written and flows from one scene to the next seamlessly.  The acting is realistically played, solid and well directed.  It is refreshing to see a movie that gives a genuine feel of what combat could be like in a senario like this.  Especially when you compare it to the similarly named Battle for Los Angeles. (Spoiler Alert: that one sucks.  DON'T BUY!).
B00C7JGDBW|3.0|Oz the Great and Powerful(released Feb/13)stars,among others,James Franco,Mila Kunis,Rachel Weisz,Michelle Williams,Zach Braff,and Bill Cobbs.Walt Disney once again takes a crack at the Oz franchise and once again comes up short.It has a weak and meandering plot and an even weaker leading man.<br />The story finds our wizard as a side show entertainer in a circus,who longs to be more than he is.He is a magician whose bag of tricks are getting very old,very fast.He is good with the ladies but does not want to be pinned down by any one in particular,even one who would like to marry him.One day the circus strongman comes after him and he hops aboard the circus balloon to save himself.However this results in his balloon getting sucked into a passing tornado.<br />When he lands on the other side he is in the land of Oz.The first person he is greeted by is a good witch named Theadora.The two hit it off,as the wizard turns on the charm,and the two end up practically engaged;at least in Theadora's mind.When they reach the Emerald City,Theodora's sister Evanora is there waiting their arrival.His presence has alerted the entire kingdom and the prophecy of the returning wizard,they think,is apparently being fulfilled.Evanora tells him the kingdom is his to rule when he destroys the wicked witch who resides in the dark forest.<br />The wizard leaves for the dark forest with a flying monkey called Finlay he met on the way to Oz,and along the way he picks up another traveling companion,a cute little china doll.When they reach their destination they find their quarry and plan to just steal her wand and break it.Their plans go awry and they come face to face with her.As it turns out it is Glinda,the good witch of the south.<br />Evanora has tricked both the wizard and her own sister Theodora.Evannora,to retain an ally,shows her sister the goings on with Glinda through her crystal ball.It makes Theodora enraged.She gets so mad she takes a bite of an apple Evanora gives her,which turns her into a hideous green skinned evil witch.<br />The wizard meanwhile has been introduced to a  variety of Oz inhabitants by Glinda,including Quadlings,Tinkerers and Munchkins.The wizard and Glinda concoct a plan to attack the Emerald City.The first attack is by robotic scarecrows through the poppy field.Glinda lays a low\\"fog\\"over the poppies to hide them and as the flying monkeys descend down to field level,they almost all fall asleep.However two grab and whisk away Glinda.The wizard now has to hatche a further plan to get Glinda back.He has a balloon float seemingly away from the city with the him aboard.The balloon is destroyed by Theodora,and the bait is taken.The wizard reappears courtesy of a holographic like projector with smoke,which he uses to intimidate the two witches.Theordora flies off on her broom,while Evanora flees into her castle.There she and Glinda have it out and Glinda defeats her,but Evanora is taken away by two flying monkeys.<br />The film comes to its conclusion as the wizard presents his friends with gifts for their support and he takes Glinda behind his curtain for a romantic kiss.<br />The leading character in a film like this, would have to have been played by someone with good acting skills,and with charisma and panache,as that is who this movie revolves around when all is said and done.Franco was terribly miscast.His acting is weak and he looks terribly uncomfortable in his role.This undermined,for me,the entire movie,despite all the good special effects this movie spewed forth.Any moment of pathos,drama or comedy were severally weakened by his inability to \\"bring it\\".He couldn't even come up to the level of his fellow players,and as a result dragged many of them down with him.<br />As with many a Sam\\"Evil Dead\\"Raimi film,the director once again cast his old friend Bruce Campbell in a small supporting role.He is the guard at the gates of the Emerald City who gets hit on the head by Finlay(Mr.Campbell I'm sure could make much out ofthat!).I bring Bruce's appearance up for one reason:THAT is who should have been cast in the lead role.Bruce Campbell could have given that character exactly what the role called for;a depth and humour Franco couldn't touch with a 10 foot pole.<br />This film is kind of a prequel to the Oz books themselves,but it does mention characters like Quadlings,Winkies,and others that appear in the original books but have never been mentioned on film before.The film also has the odd salute to the /39 film.<br />Watch as the wizard leaves the Emerald City.In the background in a field,is the\\"horse of a different colour\\".The best part of the film,I found,was the china doll character;CGI created at that.<br />Technically speaking the film starts out in black and white,in a square box,center screen.Then when the wizard reaches Oz,the screen expands to a 2:40:1 a/r and colour.The picture was clear and crisp.As with many Disney one disc DVDs,there are no extras.<br />All in all with a weak plot and an even weaker leading man,this film was doomed to fail.I couldn't get behind or believe Franco's role for one second.The special effects are good but it is not enough to make up for its other shortcomings.Barely three stars.that!).I bring Bruce's appearance up for one reason:THAT is who should have been cast in the lead role.Bruce

1451624468|1.0|I'm confused why the ratings for this book is so high.<br /><br />The title is very misleading. The book is essentially a review of the last few decades' development in cosmology, focusing on Big Bang for the most part. Only in the final chapters of the book does it so slightly touch upon the real \\"Why there is something rather than nothing?\\" There's no one right approach to this question, but the book, given its misleading title, does not address this question very satisfactorily and merely suggests an answer for how the universe might have exploded from empty space. He justifies this by saying that the why question is silly and only how can be answered.<br /><br />If you are looking for an in-depth or more mature (especially if you are more mathematically/analytically inclined) discussion on any of the topics that he so briefly mentions, this is the wrong book. This can at best serve as as popular science book, dumbing down the deepest findings of cosmology into a few \\"facts,\\" lacking much meaningful analysis or data. (He does try to trace the development of cosmology and some motivations and reasonings behind theoreticians and cosmologists, but lacks too much detail to convey any effective development.) The lack of depth in the book should be clear from its rather short length (~200 pages), few words on each page, and its reviews claiming to cover so much of all of modern science--he just doesn't have enough pages to cover any of them in deep meaningful way.<br /><br />But it even fails to be a good popular science book or a book at all with its horrible writing style. His sentences are unnecessarily convoluted, his paragraphs and content are super repetitive, and seemingly out of order that you are forced to maintain a register in your head as you read to make any meaningful connections. An example of this is all his ramblings about the \\"flat universe\\" in the middle few chapters. His writing style is so confusing and jumps between everywhere that is unclear what the motivation for flat universe is, what the evidence is, what the evidence against is, and what the current belief is, and how it ties altogether with dark matter and dark energy. Also, a few times throughout the book, he simply mentions \\"we'll come back to this later\\" and just leaves the reader confused since it's not even clear what he was going to talk about in some cases.<br /><br />If you want a simple cursory overview of modern cosmology and you are fascinated by simple snippets of popular science without much backing, you could try this book, which throws out a few interesting ideas such as big bang, inflation, cosmological constant, dark matter, antimatter ...<br />but if you are looking for any thorough answer to the title's question, or want a deep overview of any one topic (such as string theory), this is a terrible book.<br />If you don't believe me, go to a bookstore first or see the preview to skim a few pages; the lack of content and repetitiveness will be clear.the motivation for flat universe is, what the evidence is, what the evidence against is, and what the current belief is, and how it ties altogether with dark matter and dark energy.

B008JFUR10|4.0|***This review may contain spoilers***<br /><br />  Even to this day, Toho's demented giant creature features and Devlin/Emmerlich's 1998 \\"Godzilla\\" remake have their defenders (and I am among them to a limited degree).  No doubt the monsters were often rubbery and freaky fakes with their wires showing and the (usually) Japanese protagonists were overwrought hams with often bizarrely-dubbed English dialogues and slow, boring personal dramas. Or, the monster may have looked, sounded, and acted convincingly and frighteningly but not given a hell of a lot to do (yes, you, 1998 Godzilla).  Nevertheless, these campy epics could be certainly watchable, diverting, and even suspenseful.  Yet, every so often, even champions of these \\"kaiju\\" (Japanese for \\"monster\\") flicks, and I, must have wished that these flicks could get a sophisticated big-budget CGI blockbuster treatment and still remain faithful to their roots.  To a triumphant degree, \\"Pacific Rim\\" (hereafter PR) has answered our prayers.<br /><br />  As it should be, the premise is simple and direct.  As PR's prologue explains, for millennia, seemingly countless sky-towering kaiju kept emerging from a fissure or portal at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean and ravaged the earth for food and resources.  Fortunately, mankind discovered that heavy nuclear weaponry could repel and destroy these bizarre beasts - at first.  However, more adaptable and invulnerable Kaiju emerged from the ocean floor.  As a desperate last defense, mankind (through the Pan Pacific Defense Corps or PPDC) constructed skyscraper-sized robots called Jaegers (German for \\"Hunters\\") to combat the Kaiju.<br /><br />  These robots are not sentient.  Indeed, because of their colossal size, Jaegers require two pilots, each representing the left and right hemispheres of the brain, to operate the left and right sides of the robot body - like a combination of virtual reality and remote control.  To make sure the Jaeger functions fluidly (and not like a schizophrenic drunk), the two pilots must establish a neural link (called the drift) that permits telepathic communication and sharing of ideas and memories.  The only drawback to the drift is that the pilots may share traumatic memories that inhibit their performance and jeopardize the mission.<br /><br />  Among the best of the Jaegar pilots is gung-ho, cocky, but appealing Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) and his brother Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff).  The best, until an abortive Kaiju mission where the brothers failed to make sure the Kaiju stayed defeated flings Charlie's brother to his death.  Understandably having lost his confidence, Raleigh resignedly takes a job as an engineer working to construct towering coastal barriers in an attempt to contain the Kaiju after various Jaegar failures shelve the program.  However, after the barriers prove ineffective, PPDC commander Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba, a dependable actor redeeming himself after his underwritten role in \\"Prometheus\\") recruits Raleigh to give the Jaegers (namely Gypsy Danger) another go.  Besides the shocking memories of his brother's death, another obstacle to Raleigh's getting back in the saddle is finding a \\"neurally compatible\\" pilot.  Athletic, nimble, and martial-arts savvy Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) seems to be the ideal candidate.<br /><br />  However, during the \\"maiden launch\\" of the Gypsy Danger, Mako's painful memory of a catastrophic Kaiju city attack that killed her family while she was a very young girl disrupts the proceedings and almost destroys the military facility.  As a result, Pentecost detains Raleigh and Mako and sends the impressively capable father/son Jaeger pilot team of Herc and Chuck Hanson (Max Martini and Robert Kazinsky) plus a couple of auxiliary robots (including one with four arms).  Chafing under their grounding and the taunting disregard of Chuck, Raleigh and Mako can only watch as the \\"digital\\" Jaegars are immobilized and crushed by Predator-like and bat-like Kaiju, which then advance upon a helpless Hong Kong.  Just in time, Stacker grudgingly deploys Raleigh and Mako, who get their act together and in a titanic battle stop both Kaiju.<br /><br />  Meanwhile, one half of an accomplished but risibly cranky and contentious scientific duo, the loudly arrogant and bespectacled Dr. Newton (Newt) Geiszler (Charlie Day) examines cerebral tissue obtained from Kaiju corpses, including the one left in Hong Kong plus its fetus (!), and from a shady, potentially lethal \\"Kaiju body parts\\" black marketer Hannibal Chau.  Dr. Geiszler finds he can create his own neural link with the beasts and gradually learn more about them.  Of course this two-way reciprocal link means the Kaiju can read and pinpoint Dr. Geiszler's mind, which imperiled the Hong Kong bunker where Geiszler hid with some of the population.  With the help of the peevishly skeptical Dr. Herman Gottlieb (Burn Gorman) this all leads to a possible solution to the Kaiju problem: if the Jaegers can infiltrate the Kaiju portal and destroy it from within, no more monsters can pour out.  Can the Jaegers -named Gypsy Danger- do it, and can its pilots Raleigh and Mako get out alive?<br /><br />  I found PR to be a satisfying but not mind-numbing adrenaline rush, with well-paced but exhilarating human, robot and monster action.  Especially during the Hong Kong sequence, the monster/robot pummelings and attacks were literally earth-shaking and engrossing and especially loud.  And yet, in quieter moments, PR took the time to develop character motivations and interactions, even if you've seen them a million times before, and to make them affecting and achingly real.  Mako's memory of her encounter with a Kaiju was especially shocking, sad, and eerily reminiscent of 9/11. Raleigh was appropriately committed, supportive, and loyal, especially to his partner but (refreshingly) not lover Mako, and strangely both loyal to and defiant of Stacker.  Stacker demonstrated both leadership toughness and (almost overprotective) paternal care towards an unexpected adoptive daughter, and can certainly deliver an inspirational fight speech.  And oh, yes, the scientists did manage to be funny despite occasional abrasiveness.  PR serves as a high-tech homage to Toho, Godzilla (including his roar), and even sci-fi films such as \\"Independence Day\\" and references them heavily, but always with style and intelligence and rip-roaring action.  I look forward to buying the DVD.<br /><br />P.S.: I am dismayed to learn that PR is turning out to be a flop in the States.  Initially, I was baffled by this, then I pondered a few possible reasons why: 1) Although there are protagonists in the movie, primarily Raleigh and Mako, I guess they weren't featured often or prominently enough for some people; 2) Almost all of the monster/robot fight scenes were filmed at night, perhaps to conceal some perceived CGI flaws; 3) Admittedly it was sometimes difficult to differentiate the fighting combatants because of some quick, close-up editings, 4) I believe some people have a xenophobic and foreign bias against seemingly \\"non-American\\" movies, and 5) \\"Kaiju\\" movies may have mainly an esoteric or devoted cult status.  Oh well, that is their concern.  As retribution, I hope PR cleans up overseas, and particularly breaks box-office records in Japan.<br /><br />P.P.S.: I've heard that a 2014 Godzilla remake is in the works.  For it to succeed, I highly recommend it have the lines \\"He's unstoppable.\\" and/or \\"All our weapons are useless against him.\\"ich then advance upon a helpless Hong Kong.

B008JFUQ3O|4.0|***This review may contain spoilers***<br /><br />  Without a doubt, this is one crazy, clever, and outrageous bullet train of an animated movie that does its energetic best to wring out the laughs (and mostly succeeds).  Part of  \\"Despicable Me 2's\\" (hereafter DM2) success are its inspired plot borrowings such as \\"The Incredibles\\", the Bond movie series, \\"Lilo and Stitch\\" and even \\"Cars 2\\" to embroil everyone's favorite Uncle Fester/Dr. Evil hybrid ex-supervillian Gru (Steve Carell) in a world dominance plot using cute beasties turned into purple, fanged wrecking balls.<br /><br />  Another part of its success is the gradual revelation of Gru's more positive qualities such as his growing, more tolerant, and sometimes excessive compassion towards his adoptive children Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), the eldest and a budding teenager, tomboyish middle child Edith (Dana Gaier), and button-cute unicorn fanatic Agnes (Elsie Fisher), the youngest.  We also must not forget the winning, prepossessing debut of  resourceful Anti-Villain League agent Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig, using her Lola Bunny voice from \\"The Looney Tunes Show\\") who recruits the somewhat reluctant Gru to go uncover with her at a mall bakery to uncover which of the mall proprietors is behind the purple mutant plot.  The flabby but suave and mysterious Eduardo Perez/El Macho (Benjamin Bratt), the mall Mexican restaurant owner with an alluring son (Mois&eacute;s Arias) involved with Margo, also keeps the proceedings hopping.  All of the aforementioned stuff, in my opinion, works as smart, coherent entertainment.<br /><br />  But what powers and keeps this bullet train together is one of the most insidiously and surprisingly endearing creations of any movie - the little old Minions.  These slyly captivating characters prove the old adage that introducing lots of cute, fun, silly, little people in a movie is a surefire, lucrative way to lure people to an animated film. Characters such as the Smurfs, Pokemon, and the 627 experiments from \\"Lilo and Stitch\\" have certainly proven that.  They can easily capture young children's interest.<br /><br />  But unlike the Smurfs, etc., Minions have crossover appeal to parents as well.  Sure they babble childishly and otherwise act like overstimulated, quarrelsome brats.  But the Minions are also industrious, satirical and hip assistants with some adult sensibilities, always eager to help Gru with his radically new espionage job, parenting, and love life predicaments.  These Twinkie-shaped, blue over-all wearing dynamos keep DM2's pace from ever flagging.<br /><br />  This is not to say that the Minions completely detract from the main storyline.  I think we want to see Gru surmount childhood disappointments, his uncertainties and his sinister past to be a good do-gooder, better parent, and perhaps a suitable match for Lucy.  But DM2 wouldn't be quite the same without the Minions serving as Greek chorus, comedy relief, and (mostly) trustworthy Gru sidekicks AND foster children.  No wonder Illumination Entertainment plans an exclusive feature for them.  Now if they can only introduce a Minionette.periments from \\"Lilo and Stitch\\" have certainly proven that.

B001E45XT4|2.0|I own a few Plantations products.  My favorites include the .Audio 995 ($99) my gaming head set and the Plantronics Voyager Legend ($199 reduced to $99 thanks Sprint) for my cell phone.  I have to say the Gamecom 367 disappointed me.  We were given these headsets at work to do video teleconferencing.  The second I put these head phones on, I felt as if my head was in a suction tube.<br /><br />1.  I have a pretty average head for a female, but smaller than average ears. The headphones sit really low below the ear, and applied pressure to the glands behind my ears.  I tried to adjust them every which way I could, but nothing felt right.<br /><br />2. I have a co-worker who is big into sound and he thought the sound quality was average.<br /><br />3.  They are huge and heavy! Huge does not mean good.<br /><br />4.  The padding was plush and soft, but it did not help with the pressure.<br /><br />5.  I like the design of the Microphone, however, it does sit a bit far away from the mouth.  If you want to talk in a lower than average tone, it makes it difficult.<br /><br />I gave 1 star for the price and 1 star for the headphones/plush padding. If you want a really great headset, try the .Audio 995.  The quality is better and the fit is phenomenal.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The graphics are awesome and the care tasks that need to be completed are close to the real thing. This game is so fun to play.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|This is my favorite new series. It's got comedy and drama. I was instantly addicted after watching the pilot show. I've seen all episodes and dying for the show this week. Highly recommend
B000FC0O7M|5.0|This book provided a unique, inside Mission Control viewpoint from a giant in space exploration. Gene Kranz and his flight control colleagues were the brains behind the flash of the astronauts... taking America to accomplishments only dreamed of by other nations.  This is a must-read for all space geeks like me1
B00AW28HF6|4.0|Tsunami Connection is a fast-paced political thriller, intense, gripping,  and action-packed.<br /><br />The plot of this international espionage tale focuses on Kefira, a highly-skilled Mossad operative.  The book starts with a dangerous and deadly military operation in the Sinai Desert. Kefira is in the center of the action and comes across as rational, logical, and highly trained. Kefira's strong intuition, probably also a result of her training and experience, helps her make the right decisions in very difficult circumstances.<br /><br />A few chapters later, the author takes us back in time to a younger Kefira.  The scene in her high school headmaster's office is tense, emotional, and provides the readers with an understanding of traumatic events that brought Kefira to her life in the Mossad and hints at the reasons for the strength of her character.<br /><br />One of the aspects of this book that I especially enjoyed is the change of pace that kept me involved in this story from start to finish. The narrative varied from tension-filled action scenes to quieter, slower (but still tense) scenes that allowed for a more in-depth character development. One of my favorite scenes is Kefira's interaction with Fripo, an older man she meets in Buenos Aires.<br />Their interaction is not only important  to the plot, but it also gives the readers an opportunity to see a different side of Kefira: she puts her guard down and shares her feelings on a traumatic event in her childhood that has shaped her life. That interaction is one of the many scenes that make Kefira a much more realistic character, a person to relate to and root for.<br /><br />I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest non-reciprocal review.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I like Minecraft. One of the most popular, time consuming, and fun games ever. For those of you complaining about version 0.7.0, it is out. You can update Minecraft by scrolling the top down and clicking SYNC! If that doesn't work, go to the app store and go to the Minecraft page. Where 6.99 was, it should say UPDATE! If that doesn't work, your Kindle must be hacked or has a glitch because I have the update.
B006I1OB0U|5.0|I had not even heard about Downton Abbey until I had an email from Newt Gingrich saying what a great series it was, so I checked it out and ordered all of the series now and both my husband and I have loved the series....every one of them! Cannot wait until series 4 starts and hope now to catch it on PBS. It was so entertaining and beautifully done, and certainly filled the gap of nothing worth watching on TV anymore. I really miss not being able to put in a DVD now and watch what happens next. If you have never started the series I would surely recommend it. The clothes, scenery, and their way of life is so interesting.

B000JMKQX0|4.0|I have read just about every zombie/extinction event fiction book available including all the 99¢ pulp / amateur ones around and I admittedly left 'World War Z' for just about dead last due mainly to the popularity, cost and the fact that the author with his relative popularity and TV appearances ....comes off like kind of a douche (sorry dude). The book reads well but gets maybe a bit tedious towards the end when we start rehashing ideas from earlier in the book and are just trying to 'wrap things up'. I kind of wish we revisited other intriguing events in the book (some were just left as is, no spoilers here) than some of the points it came back to, but I can also appreciate the ambitious effort to cover so many topics at once, and it only leaves so much space without the book doubling in size and becoming that much more tedious.<br /><br />All in all I have to admit its a really good book and was mainly just turned off by its mainstream popularity.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|i was eager to read this book because I had liked the earlier novels by the author.  This book is set of separate stories that don't necessarily complement each other.

B00A50PDDY|4.0|Album: 4 stars: Live set: 5 stars<br /><br />Twenty One Pilots, the Columbus, OH-based duo consisting of Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun, released this, their debut album, in early 2013. I had listened to it before and it didn't really resonate all that much with me. Then I saw these guys in concert recently (more on that later), and I simply had to give this another listen.<br /><br />\\"Vessel\\" starts off with several can't miss tracks, each of which could be a radio single, if commercial radio were still any good, which of course it isn't. The surging \\"Odd to Sleep\\" sounds like it could be Ben Folds from 15 years ago. \\"Holding On To You\\" sounds musically like it came straight from Phoenix, but then Twenty One Pilots adds some rapping. \\"Migraine\\" is an all-out rap song, but one that actually is fun to listen to. \\"House of Gold\\" is a lighter tune, with some folksy influences. If there is a theme developing, it is that Twenty One Pilots is the curious mix of piano/keyboard-driven pop with a healthy doses of rap. I am not a fan of rap, generally speaking, reasons why I probably didn't give this album a fair chance when I first listened to it. Upon reflection, I am more impressed by the melodies, and the smart pop hooks that appear throughout. In all, I am very happy I gave this album another spin.<br /><br />As to that live set, I saw these guys last weekend at the Bunbury music festival here in Cincinnati, where they played a late afternoon set on the main stage, and they KILLED. Starting their set with \\"Ode to Sleep\\" (and playing most of the tracks rom \\"Vessel\\"), the duo played a 60 min. set with a level of energy and excitement that I hadn't seen in a long time, and was simply infectious for the crowd, which ate it up. In turn Jospeh and Dun fed off of the huge response from the crowd, and it became one of those very special live sets where it feels something big is happening. As mentioned, I didn't care much for the album before this, but I was so impressed (and entertained) by their set that I just had to give it another shot. From looking at the comments on the festival's facebook wall, it seems that TONS of people thought this was the best set of the entire festival. If you have a chance to see these guys live, DO NOT MISS THEM!ned) by their set that I just had to give it another shot.

0321334876|5.0|This book is not a reference manual.<br />This book is not a &#34;how to program&#34; in C++.<br />What the author has done is outline some very important aspects of C++ programming that are either not taught in the typical college curriculum, or easily forgotten, or completely misunderstood.<br /><br />This book has 55 topics. The order they are listed in kinda makes sense. Overall it seems that the topics are listed from simple first to complicated last. There is a short introductory chapter explaining the order of the topics.<br /><br />I really like how the author describes C++ as a &#34;federation&#34; of languages. That's in the first chapter/introduction. It just keeps getting better and better.<br /><br />A few of the topics were common sense and made me wonder if it was really worth mentioning. However, I see some really stupid idiotic code on a daily basis, so apparently there are programmers out there that need to be reminded of the basics.<br /><br />Some of these topics blow my mind. I mean really, this guy must have spent months just researching the behaviors of the C++ compiler to figure some of this stuff out.<br /><br />I have nothing negative to say about this book.

Also I was disappointed to not have MORE of a recap at the end of the CD, of the Main points needs to MAKE A CHANGE in your Habits.  The MEAT of this Book/CD is on disc 3 & 4 (I think - cant remember which one) but that was the best parts!
0307588343|2.0|Author brags alot and the fact that his father foresaw the entire collapse, this just made me loose interest. he repeats this over 3 or four times during the book. why didnt his father tell the news or wrote a book about it. yeah the guy is a self made millionaire but i font think he was the most qualified to write about the collapse, he wast even senior management; lower level management if anything.  i finish reading then disposed of it.

B005544TRQ|5.0|I loved the plot and fell in love with the characters instantly. There are not so many episodes that it is a burden to try and watch the series.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I bought this because so many friends recommend it. Turns out they were right. It is not my usual cup of tea, but it was a fun popcorn night movie to watch. I am now looking forward to the next one and may buy the books too.

B006M4F67A|4.0|Not a lot of games but fun.  It also has a hint feature that can come in handy.  Would be great if there were more variations.
B000HL0EEE|5.0|This show was about the early pioneer era of the Star Trek universe. Here we see an earth civilization new to interstellar travel that must prove itself to to more seasoned civilization in order to take its place in what will one day become the United Federation of Planets. To a Trek fan that is far more interesting in a whole lot of hide behind the Prime Directive alein species of the week stories.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I'm a 11 year old girl. I know its weird for a girl to like this game. I love that there is peaceful creative and survival. all I can say is BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|This film is wonderful!  My hats off to Dustin Hoffman and all the actors.  I first saw it in a movie theatre and liked it so much that I bought it.  The subject of aging is handled with dignity, respect and a lot of humor.  I can only hope, should I end up in a retirement home, to have such experiences.  When I went to see it in the theatre I was with a good friend, who has been teaching music for many years.  She commented that the actors were actually playing the instruments, that they were not &#34;acting&#34;.  She was able to tell this from watching.  It was only at the end of the movie, as the credits were rolling, that we learned that most of the actors were former musicians and opera singers.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its pretty fun and extremely easy tovuee. kind of like nintendogs for the ds but with horses. not bad at all. a little addicting

B003H4I4JU|2.0|I feel like if you are reading this book because you really liked the first, this one falls flat.  Has a completely different style and I almost feel like I am reading a mystery novel.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|great game many different boards to complete family involvement I'm glad it was free and you don't need to purchase upgrades
B009F7OQ5Y|5.0|This was a birthday gift.  It was a little bit expensive but she loved it. I am happy for it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I liked this app even before the update but now it's even better.  It tells you everything you might want to know about the weather and even includes radar.
B004P1JDJO|5.0|I really liked this book, because sometimes we don't understand why we don't feel motivated or other people working for us can't seem to enjoy their activities. Even when it provides with a lot of scientific information, is really friendly and easy to read, and of course, very understandable!!<br />If you deal with people, if you're a leader or are interested in the topic, this book is a must!
B005HJWWW8|4.0|This amp works well as advertised, there's a couple presets, with uneditable EQ settings, and they work alright. Seems to boost lows, mids, and highs respectively. Works great for that little boost, the only thing more I would like is some EQ customization, and that seems to be on their more expensive models. But for portability and a little bass boost (I was using Sony MDR-V6 Monitor Series Headphones) they work wonderfully.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|We watched this with four children ranging from age 7 - 13 and it truly kept all ages captivated from start to finish.  Great story telling, and the boy, &#34;Pi&#34; both actors that portrayed Pi at all the different ages were great.<br /><br />Now a week later, the kids are all saying they didn't quite understand the point of the movie, and to be honest, I don't know if I felt it was clear either.<br /><br />Either way, it's rare to find a clean, captivating, wonderful story with absolutely STUNNING cinematography.  I would compare it to a warm and strange dream that stays with you for days.<br /><br />I DO recommend it!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I played this game before but I really, really, REALLY wish it was free because I can't afford it so I cannot play it. :(

B004IK8Q86|4.0|I did not expect to like The Razor's Edge. Based on Maugham's other works (especially Of Human Bondage) I expected the story to be overtold--and it was; I expected excessive detail--which was there; I expected somewhat obvious and trite (at least dated) themes--which were also there.  Nevertheless, the narrative flow, felicity of the language, and character of the narrator are such that one keeps reading until suddenly a rather longish novel is over.  What is important about The Razor's Edge is not<br />what Maugham says but how he has his narrator (himself) say it.  While it is interesting to note that this novel anticipates the theme of oriental mysticism that became so popular in the 1960s, what Maugham says about it is not particularly effective or revealing.  It's his narrator who carries the novel and outshines all of the other characters.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is so much fun it keeps me busy thinking! It has so many levels to play it is so puzzling some times!
B008XGW1CI|5.0|I loved the book. I found the description of social classes fascinating, especially her treatment of the less fortunate. I was quite taken with how she captured the speech patterns of the young people in the story. All of the characters were well formed and interesting. It was a moving story and very engaging. I've recommended the book widely.

0440246318|4.0|About a third of the way into this thriller FBI Special Agent Julia Sorenson is speeding through Iowa at about one hundred miles per hour. If anything the pace of this story, from page one, is even faster that Sorenson's speed as she chases after Jack Reacher, the protagonist of this breathtakingly exciting novel from the pen of Lee Child.<br />The suspense is palpable as well, for Reacher has hitched a ride with two men who have already killed another and have a female partner (?) in the rear seat of their sedan. The plot unfolds quickly but methodically, with the reader sharing the thoughts of Reacher as he slowly deduces the reality below the surface appearance of his situation as rider and the events that unfold to reveal the truth that will demand all of his skills as a twenty-first century paladin.<br />The story is successful on many levels with plot and suspense being the most important. The character of Julia Sorenson was especially well-drawn adding to the complexity of the story while taking some of the pressure off of Jack Reacher, not that he could not handle it. The result is a great read for those who like their thrillers fast-paced, suspenseful, and filled with unexpected plot twists.
B0041OOEJY|5.0|My eight-year old daughter and I love this movie.  She copies the kung fu moves and it has increased her interest in martial arts.  Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan work well together, and I love the sweet love interest.

B00A8MGLAI|5.0|It's really a pity that more people didn't see this on the big screen.  It took a lot of imagination to convert the books\'s amazingly creative, linked stories into a very high impact, stunning movie.  Above all, a stirring cry for human dignity and freedom.
B004EU1YZW|5.0|Daniel Day-Lewis makes this film with his authentic portrayal of a gay man with a punk background who is trying to live without fighting.  He is in love with the lead male and is committed to make the relationship work.  The love-making scenes (always with pants on) are gentle, playful, sincere.  Considering when this was filmed. It is a very brave movie.

B000SCHC0Q|4.0|I liked this book because it exposes the cruely to women in the old Afghanistan. It is a story of sadness but does have a happy ending. The author portrays Afghanistan as it was soon after the Russiians left.
B00CA4S3LW|5.0|\\"Dancer and the Moon\\" is the latest release from Blackmore's Night. For the uninitiated (or very young!), Ritchie Blackmore was one of the original members of Deep Purple, a British rock group who was listed in the 1972 Guinness Book of World Records as \\"the globe's loudest band.\\" He also founded Rainbow, which combined baroque music elements with blues rock. Candice Night is an American vocalist/lyricist/multi-instrumentalist with a powerful yet angelic voice. The album is comprised of nine vocal pieces and three instrumentals, most of which are lively and upbeat. Some have a traditional renaissance folk spirit while others have more of a rock edge - a combination that works incredibly well in this case! Blackmore's Night's previous release, \\"Autumn Sky,\\" was awarded Best Vocal Album in the 2011 Zone Music Awards, and I would expect Dancer and the Moon to receive similar accolades. The physical CD includes a beautiful 16-page booklet with song lyrics, an explanation of where the songs came from, and lots of photos. There is also a \\"deluxe\\" CD/DVD package available.<br /><br />\\"Dancer and the Moon\\" begins with Randy Newman's classic \\"I Think It's Going to Rain Today,\\" a longtime favorite of mine. This more upbeat version updates and suits the song perfectly. \\"Troika\\" was inspired by a Ukrainian soap opera and the freedom of horses running. Joyous and exuberant, it's impossible to ignore this one or to keep it in the background. \\"The Last Leaf\\" is a gorgeous ballad with a simple renaissance folk accompaniment - guitar, violin and flute. If you aren't hooked yet, \\"The Lady In Black\\" should clinch the deal! Rather simple in structure, Night's passionate vocals and the driving bass are compelling. \\"Minstrels in the Hall\\" is the first of the instrumentals and is composed in a style of dance music from the 1500's. The title track is a lively yet mysterious song with a powerful Russian flavor. It's almost impossible to sit still while this one is playing! Love it! \\"Somewhere Over the Sea (The Moon is Shining)\\" and \\"The Moon is Shining (Somewhere Over the Sea)\\" are different versions of the same song. The first is a poignant and graceful ballad about love and loss and the second has more of a rock structure and instrumentation - both are exceptional! \\"The Spinner's Tale\\" is a lovely song based on a lament written by Richard the 3rd with new lyrics written by Night and simple instrumentation (guitar and flute). The closing track, \\"Carry On... Jon\\" is a tribute to Jon Lord, one of the founders of Deep Purple and other groups, who passed away in 2012. A great Purple-tinged ending to a great album!<br /><br />\\"Dancer and the Moon\\" has been both fun and inspiring to review and I promise that it won't be sitting on the shelf now that the review is done! Very highly recommended!re Over the Sea (The Moon is Shining)\\" and \\"The Moon is Shining (Somewhere Over the Sea)\\" are different versions of the same song.

B005I4JG80|5.0|Great for anyone about to have kids, or already raising kids. Also great for people who love the French and are interested in how they think and live. More than just a book about raising children- a sociological study of France. Some of the ideas from this book might help us Americans get our society back on track too!

1593272200|5.0|Mr. Kerrisk did an amazing work in this book.<br /><br />I purchased this book one year ago, on July 2012, and since then it has served me pretty well. I can not count how many times I faced a technical doubt and I found a  enlightening explanation in this book.<br /><br />This book covers almost all aspects of Linux low-level application programming: file I/O, IPC, process management and threads to name a few. Even being focused on user-space programming, this book has better explanations of file systems and sockets than most kernel programming books I've read.<br /><br />I read this book cover to cover and I can say I improved my Linux's knowledge close to 70%.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This series was recommended to me by my daughter, and truly, I was prepared not to like it.  Not usually a fan of &#34;lawyer&#34; shows.  But to my surprise, this was quite good.  Very witty, fast paced and interesting characters.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Good for both young and older readers.  I'm reading classics and this one is a must read.  Although this book was written in the mid 1800, life's lessons remain the same.

B00BESM14U|5.0|I came late to this party and also came into this story rather critical because it had been so hyped up for years. I get the hype. I was crying while I read and not because it was sad or tragic, but because the story is really wonderful. The characters are great and the format of the story fits it so well. I cannot imagine this story not written in letter-form. Teens or adults, this one is a fast and captivating read.
B00CHRB9RM|5.0|With Duane gone, it was up to Betts to make the studio record work and he OWNS it from start to finish.  A triumphant record on every level, especially given the circumstances.  For any Allman Brothers fan, new product is always a treat, so the studio outtakes disc is great as well.  The only problem with the Winterland discs, despite their brilliance, is the reliance on Betts to carry the day on virtually every song.  He was able to do it on Brothers and Sisters with ease, but asking him to dominate an entire live show in the same fashion that he and Duane used to is simply asking too much.  And I'm not sure even Duane could have made 25 minutes of Les Brers in A Minor work.  Still a great 4 disc collection that every fan should own.
0345803485|1.0|Woof. This thing was so stupid. I found multiple grammar/editing errors. I would love to sit in on a psychology class about these books because the characters are all train wrecks that need examining.

B007W8S2MG|5.0|I wasn't sure what to make of this game at first. I had never played a Persona game before and there's a lot of hype. Purchased shortly before my first child was born two weeks ago. Plowed through it in those two weeks. Immediately started a new game + because of course I missed all the cool crap. It's like digital crack. Oh and in it you can have MANY GIRLFRIENDS.

B008JFUPZI|1.0|\\"R.I.P.D.\\" happens to be one of those movies that could have been something great had some fatal decisions not been made. The premise is a decent one.  A recently slain cop joins up with a band of undead police officers to police the undead who didn't want to leave earth, all the while investigating his own death and parting ways with his existence.  The first big problem that came out glaring from the get-go is the sickeningly close resemblance to another movie that also used an acronym as its title; \\"Men in Black\\" aka \\"M.I.B.\\".  Once Reynolds character, Nick, passes over, you can't help but feel like you've been here before with the strange characters and the weird partner and the white walls, etc. etc. etc.  They copied \\"MIB\\"'s style, look and replaced aliens with ghosts and you'd think they could have at least not used an acronym as well.<br /><br />Then there's Jeff Bridges playing an old west sheriff named Roy.  The movie tries to be as funny and quirky as \\"Men in Black\\" but only once or twice does the comedy actually work.  I was thinking that maybe some more of the comedy would have worked had we actually been able to understand Bridge's mumbling incoherent words. He sort of did the same thing in 2010's \\"True Grit\\" and I remembered thinking the same thing then, although this time, it was even worse. If this is his normal voice, which it may be, then his career is in trouble.<br /><br />As \\"Men in...\\" err, \\"R.I.P.D.\\" plays out, the story is actually a really good one and it's a terrible shame that the creators didn't brainstorm a little longer to try and be more unique, but they didn't. In fact, the finale of the film is absolutely fantastic and the best part of the movie.  In the movies final moments the effects are outstanding and the emotions of the characters are fleshed out, giving \\"R.I.P.D.\\" at least one thing to be positive about. Unfortunately, it took a long and painful time getting there.<br /><br />Bottom line, this movie was poorly handled by director Robert Schwentke. A perfect example of how poorly it was handled is the use of one of the best gimmicks in the film. Nick and Roy don't look the same when they are earthbound. Nick looks like an elderly Asian man and Roy looks like supermodel Marisa Miller. It is a funny gimmick but even this is poorly used. There are many moments where it would have been better to have had Marisa Miller delivering the lines instead of Jeff Bridges. Regardless of how poor of an actress she was or is, we could have understood the words and it would have been funnier having her deliver some of Roy's lines. There's no excuse for wasting such a great gimmick.

Will and Jaden Smith and their \\"After Earth\\" are thankful, as well as Robert Deniro from \\"Big Wedding\\".ctor Robert Schwentke. A perfect example of how poorly it was handled is the use of one of the best gimmicks in the film. Nick and Roy don't look the same when they are earthbound. Nick looks like an elderly Asian man and Roy looks like supermodel Marisa Miller. It is a funny gimmick but even this is poorly used. There are many moments where it would have been better to have had Marisa Miller delivering the lines instead of Jeff Bridges. Regardless of how poor of an actress she was or is, we could have understood the words and it would have been funnier having her deliver some of Roy's lines. There's no excuse for wasting such a great gimmick.

B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is a fun game and a nice distraction. My niece turned me on to it and we play back and forth. Good for the brain to figure out the words.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|Good movie, well written and acted. It has a few scary parts for the kids to watch out for but no where near the violence on an average TV show.<br />I love the actors, worked well together and made the movie very entertaining to watch.
B004YXE438|5.0|I like this game so much that I went and bought  all of the expansion apps.<br />I have spent many an evening going through all sizes and difficulty levels.<br />Can't wait for the next batch of puzzles. I am HOOKED.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids love this game. They were laughing and yelling how cool the game is. They had trouble stopping and turning the kindle off.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|Our family enjoyed the 3-D quality of this blu-ray and family friendly story of the movie. It is collectible to our family movie shelf.
B0058VW36U|4.0|My 7 year old has a Kindle and my 3 year old wants anything bro has so this is a game he LOVES to play and it has no violence so I allow it for both. Cute game.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|Amazing. A Movie that I could watch over and over again. it makes me cry every time I watch it.
B00BTYP6QE|3.0|My boys love the other Cut the Rope, but this one is a bit different and they are not as happy with it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|really neat game ,great for horse lover's, both boys and girls. lets you learn lots about taking care of horses
0399159347|5.0|Going to be a HUGE hit in 2013! You know to NEVER EVER miss a book written by Moriarty! I loved What Alice Forgot, so when this one came out, I had had had to read it! And I loved it. Of course.<br /><br />Three women's lives intersect, something none of them planned. Cecilia is the main character. And she finds a letter in her attic, addressed to her. From her husband. Whom is dead. I mean, what would you do? Crazy!! Even crazier is after that.<br /><br />No one else could write quite as elegantly as Moriarty, spinning such a tale, I didn't want to come back to reality. I love each woman, such wonderful stories I loved how it all came together so amazingly at the end, I just sighed. Ah, this is WHY I read!!!<br /><br />I put myself in Cecilia's place --- highly recommend!!
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|I'm a Civil War buff, so I thought I would love this movie. I hated it. It was as interesting as watching 2 hours of C-Span. It was also very politically correct... but I won't get in to that. No matter what your politics and view of history, this was a boring movie. My wife hated it as well. How can you make Lincoln and the Civil War boring?!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I usually read the book and then watch the movie ... but this time I watched HBO series first. I am glad that I did. There are so many characters to follow. It helped to have a visual face reference when I started reading the book. The book and the first season really adhere to each other. The dialog especially. After the first few chapters I felt like I had already read the book. That said... I highly recommend reading the book AND watching the series. The book will show you what is going on inside each characters mind - very enlightening. There were some deviations from the physical appearance of some of the characters red hair versus black hair and Tyrion is described uglier in the book than on HBO. I am about half way through book 2. ~ very enjoyable read.
B00CMYRVAO|5.0|Joe after 10+ yrs still delivers his soulful voice. Great CD. It won't disappoint if you a true Joe fan.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Father and children were not disappointed. They still play this and &#34;Ticket to Ride&#34; often. It was a good alternative to change things up with.
B0089LOG02|5.0|As I read the Orphan Train, I found myself on an emotional ride with the characters.  It was a great historical fiction book that brought to light the plight of over 200,000 orphans, who were sent to various regions of the country during the last half of the 19th century and the early 20th century.  This particular book masterfully weaved the story of the &#34;historical&#34; character with a modern day teen character from the foster care system.  Each of their tragic lives culminates with them becoming friends and the teenage girl discovering through the older woman's story, that she, too can survive, and that in helping the old woman, she herself is redeemed.
B001HN694K|5.0|Depp and Alice create a refreshing new look into Wonderland. The journey did not disappoint. My kids watch it and enjoy.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|So good to read the actual book after so many B movies.  So rich in detail and a satisfying ending, though nothing like the over the top conclusions seen in films.  Just a great read for fans of the classic!
B0002KPIQY|5.0|This DVD is excellent!  The actors were fantastic and the story was so emotional.  For all the beauty she possessed, Gia was so unstable and I felt extremely sorry for her.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot even though I didn't understand all of it. I will have to give it a few more watches to see if I can get it. Had the same issue with Oblivion to be honest.
B0087ZG7J8|5.0|it was a very cute movie. I bought if for a friend and she loved it, would highly suggestion watching it
B00005JKNF|4.0|We enjoyed this movie and found it entertaining.  We bought it because Maggie Smith had a role in it and she is always great.
B0067QPVJ6|5.0|loved this movie growing up and i still love it, one of my favs and it still is, wonderful movie
1250006341|5.0|I love this book.  I recently watched seasons 1,2 and 3 and found this book and the beautiful pictures to be a delight.  I like how it told the history of the time and customs.
B00003CXB6|5.0|it was a very cute movie. I bought if for a friend and she loved it, would highly suggestion watching it
B0002TJGQS|5.0|These batteries work excellent, and were delivered before the scheduled delivery date.<br />This is a great price for what i received. Cost is better than a 2 pack..
B004SBQAN8|5.0|it was a very cute movie. I bought if for a friend and she loved it, would highly suggestion watching it
B00001QEBQ|5.0|Bought this as a present for my best friend. It arrived quickly and in mint condition.  The movie was still in its original plastic, and the DVD played perfectly.
B004CURZFC|5.0|loved this movie growing up and i still love it, one of my favs and it still is, wonderful movie
B001NFNFIK|4.0|After reading and reviewing James Lee Burke's `In the Electric Mist with Confederate Dead and discovering that a movie based on this book staring Tommy Lee Jones as David Robicheau and John Goodman  as New Orleans mobster \\"Baby Feet\\" Balboni, I decided to rent the movie at Family Video and ended up purchasing a 2008 copy for just over $5.00.<br /><br />While the movie captured the essence of the book and was great entertainment with talented stars.Tommy Lee Jones, John Goodman, Peter Sarsgaard and Mary Steenburgen were fantastic in this gripping film; however, James Burke's book was so much better.<br /><br />Although it was exceptionally good, there is just no way that an all-star cast in a psychological thriller can capture the picturesque tale in the span of 102 minuets that can compare to the magic of James Lee Burkes descriptive well-developed verse in this haunting tale.<br /><br />While I recommend this gripping movie featuring wonderful music from award-winning Buddy Guy, I recommend reading the intriguing book prior to watching this film.<br /><br />I loved the book and the film and think you will too!<br /><br />Enjoy!
B005LAIHSG|5.0|it was a very cute movie. I bought if for a friend and she loved it, would highly suggestion watching it
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|Well lets just say this movie was ok to watch. The plot seemed to be simple but somehow in the end some aspects of it were never actually explained. It may be that I was expecting too much because the movie received a lot of advertisement. In the end I think the acting was cheessy meaning the actors lacked some character presence at times it felt like they were plaing for a kid audience, but the special effects compensated somewhat for this situation. This is a good movie for teenagers and kids but most adults will find it a little dull and unchallenging.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|it was a very cute movie. I bought if for a friend and she loved it, would highly suggestion watching it
B00127RAJY|5.0|I just finished this workout and I loved it- and hated it! I was so tired after the first circuit, I didn't think I could do anymore, but I pushed through it. I am 23, 5'4\\", and 145 lbs which, according to Jillian, is verging on overweight. I'm getting married in three months and need to slim down fast! I absolutely love how the workout is set up and even though it's crazy tough, it's not impossible! So glad I bought this dvd! I'll be updating a couple more times throughout the month. Can't wait to start seeing results!
B0040I09RM|5.0|A few episodes are a bit too real for a &#34;woman&#34;, BUT, the story, acting is INCREDIBLE. It is great to watch when we want. We cut our CABLE CORD and got a great remote HD ANTENNA FROM AMAZON....It's a whole new world, and we are spending more time doing other things. Also it is AMAZING not to have commercials. A 5 STAR SERIES....Being a Prime MEMBER has benefits shopping, shipping and now this...Our new flat screen remote, even has an AMAZON BUTTON....!!!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This is the next best thing to playing at a store.  It has provided me with hours of enjoyment and fun.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The actors are superb  and the story  is  captivating! Totally enjoyable.  Nasty day at work... watch this and  you'll  have a smile on your face
B002RUA524|5.0|How lovely to be transported back to a gentler time - an age, maybe, of innocence. What a great book to lift your spirits as you chuckle your way through the antics of the family, animals and Corfu characters. All are depicted with great humour, kindness, and such clarity that it feels they have become a part of your own life.
B00DHNBPA6|1.0|Having never watched the original I was very intrigued by the trailer that was shown numerous times on television. Having been burned by horror movies in the past I decided to wait until it was available to rent rather than spend an enormous amount in theaters. In the end after watching this the trailer was scarier than the actual film. This movie does not offer anything new into the horror genre at all. Cabin in the woods with an accidental release of a demon. Instead of trying to scare the audience they went with the excessive amount of gore for their tactics and it was very much the wrong decision. The acting was terrible, gore was boring and really overall a terrible film. Move along to something else...go try The Conjuring in theaters right now if you are looking for a truly scary movie.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a very nice game to waste some time on!  I've seen the real game in casinos but wouldn't want to waste my money on it there but I can play it on my Kindle just fine!
B004GCPJDQ|1.0|Are you kidding me? For $40, I can buy 60, 80, even 96 batteries with free shipping.<br /><br />Given I replace my Magic Mouse batteries at most every 4-6 months, and I don't care if you only get 30 days per pair, that's a *minimum* of four years before this product amortizes, and it's more like 16 years in my usage.<br /><br />And that's assuming that your one rechargeable unit could even conceivably last as long.<br /><br />The current fetish for inductive charging add-ons blows my mind.  There is only one argument to be made for it (especially given all the harsh quality and functional flaws in this particular product), and that's toxic waste. Get a good set of four high quality rechargeable AA. Enercel and you've solved that for at least as long as this overly expensive, over-engineered &#34;solution&#34; will last for a fraction of the cost.  And tell me you won't throw away this battery, AND its toxic waste charging station and transformer in 2-3 years when your next computer comes with a newly designed input device.<br /><br />Seriously, tell me what I'm missing here besides the &#34;convenience&#34; of not using two minutes for fresh cells ever few-several weeks/months versus all the fiddly nonsense I'm reading about here.<br /><br />oh, and you can just recycle those standard alkilyne batteries and we're back to common sense.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|I'm glad I rented this before going to the theater to see the new one Red 2. The character's relationships are important and this one explains it all.<br />Lots of action as expected.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|I love this album. So great to hear Ian Gillan still singing and the amazing rhythm section of Paice and Glover still rocking and rolling. Steve Morse is a great guitarist and Don Airey fondly recalls founder Jon Lord's hypnotic organ solos.<br /><br />Stand out tracks for me are \\"Above and Beyond,\\" \\"Apres vous\\" and \\"Vincent Price.\\" Nice tribute to the late Jon Lord on the inner cover. Highly recommended. Oh, and bonus track rocks! Get the deluxe version for sure.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini is a master story teller.  To fully appreciate his art requires reflection on the meanings of the book's title.  Then you begin to &#34;get&#34; what the story is about.
B00BVYU2P2|2.0|There are some funny moments and lines, but overall, it's just a so-so sitcom about a coming-of-age girl who will do anything to stop being humiliated and start being liked. Not my cup of tea.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I would totally recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed reading The Help. The author ready had well developed  characters.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|Really a great book. Interesting story, fascinating characters. Everything I could ask for in any kind of novel. if you're not sure of you'll enjoy this type of book, give it a try and you'll be happily surprised.
0689815816|5.0|My four-year-old loves this book.  At one time he was frightened of it, but now it is one of his favorites.  Highly recommended.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|A great return album. Lyrics are striking and Iommi's licks still sound great. Bill Ward is not here, but Rage Against the Machine's drummer Brad Wilk fills the spot well. \\"God is Dead,\\" the advanced single is a stand out track as is, \\"Age of Reason\\" and the CD's opener, \\"End of the Beginning.\\" The 3 bonus tracks on the Deluxe edition are well worth the few extra dollars. Very happy that at least 3 of the original members are still on the road and rocking.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I really love Neil Gaiman's work.  This book was wonderful.  It was a quick read.  I wanted it to last longer because the characters and the subject were so interesting. I'll end up reading this again.
1936608898|3.0|i hear its a really good book but never read it. bought for someone else. kinda spendy but then again i dont buy a look of books on amazon
B002KVAB5G|4.0|This is just at what I think of the peak of the Stones career.  Lots of fun rock. Buy it.
B008Y6OS64|2.0|I am sure there are plenty of fans of this movie, but personally I found it dull. I would not want to influence anyone else. I guess this movie was not for me!
0547884591|5.0|A good read. Even more impressive are the extraordinary photographs that accompany the recipes in the book. Wish every book were this well illustrated.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Heart wrenching page turner. Couldn't wait to see what would happen next. The author made all the characters seem so real and the story was very well written.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|This game is fun and challenging at times.  Have to be a little strategic to collect all gems...never asked to buy anything additional for this app...a big plus!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was expecting to be completely hooked by this book because all of my friends were talking about it. I have to admit that I was a little disappointed and kept watching my percentage complete increase with little excitement about the story I was reading.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have used this app on many trips and was extremely helpful. Will continue using this app on trips and at home.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|All of the Marvel movies have been good, but this is one of the best so far. I love the character developments and interactions. It is a lot of fun to watch with some amazing effects and a great story.
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|Just don't try to understand the plot, nor the likelihood of any of the movie's action sequences being even close to being possible.
B00003CY5J|5.0|This movie is good acting and a good plot. I would highly recommend this movie if you are an action movie person.
B0059GVBHG|5.0|I saw this movie &#34;used&#34; at amoeba for $30 so I was surprised when I saw this for as cheap as it was. The movie came quickly and it was in great condition!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|My phone is with me 24/7 due to my position.  I can read and enjoy any book I desire and do it anywhere.  I have introduced Kindle for Android to friends and they love it too.  And it's Free.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I'm very sorry, Dr. Alexander.  I truly wanted to like this book, but I just can't.  We all hope in an afterlife, but I cannot believe, from a theological<br />viewpoint, that what you described is true.  That's NOT to say that you don't believe it.<br />I did not finish this book, and that is very rare for me.  If you are into the metaphysical you will probably appreciate this, but not for me.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|after the first few minutes, I got up and walked out of the room. however, my husband, who is blind, had read the book and wanted to keep watching and this movie does not have descriptive video. I had been nagging him to watch it so I went back and got entranced by the movie. it hangs together well and once I got past the extreme violence, it was a great movie.<br /><br />watch the credits so you get to see exactly how many roles each of these actors play. bet you can't figure them all out!!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book was awesome. I couldn't put it down && I love the pictures in it. Made it easier to picture everything && made the book feel more real
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I don't win very much and don't want to buy coins. Love to play but numbers are too fast to get all of them
B00881VLCE|1.0|I just updated this app and it won't work properly.  It's incredibly slow and &quot;jerky&quot;.  I loved it before the update now I wish I'd never updated.  Frankly, I may delete it.
B000066C1N|5.0|The cd played perfectly and was exactly as described by the seller. The price was great and shipping was fast. I LOVE &#34;Spirit: Stallion of the Cimmarron&#34; movie, so of course I love the soundtrack! Perfect for anyone who loves horses!
B0009HAHD4|4.0|I accidentally tugged on the rubber eye piece on my camera and from there it got loose and would keep dropping off. I didn't want to lose it so I took it off, but then using the camera just like that wasn't comfortable.  I came across this baby and the rest is history.<br /><br />Say what this didnt come with the camera, who would have thought.  Works perfectly for my Nikon D60
B009NY43NY|5.0|This book had more twists and layers to keep track of- and it was done beautifully.  A wonderful end for this series, Ms. Harris. Thank you.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|Very entertaining series with a great storyline. Love Harvey and Michael's relationship and great cast overall. I definitely would recommend it.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Simply put it's another great movie from Marvel. Action & Adventure SiFi at its best! Can't wait till the second one comes out.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|The game is awesome,has really good graphics,the free roam is awesome,needs more levels,it is also too easy got it by May 17,2013 and finished by June 25,2013
B0098G67TU|1.0|this movie is impossible to watch. it continues ti pixilate and no sound. never had this problem with any other movie. would libeetsybaschGmail.comke to remove it from my instant video but it just doesn't happen. i finally gave it up.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|Was looking for a show to watch during the summer. After I heard House of Cards was nominated for 14 Emmys I was intrigued.<br />First episode got me hooked and now we have Netflix so we can watch them all. Soooo good. If you like politics and West Wing, you'll love this. Dark show, shows you how the \\"sausage\\" is made in Congress.
B0060QM0AG|5.0|This book is full of interesting stories,fascinating plot twists, and lovable characters. Great for everyone, from ages 1 to100. Fantastic!
B003MO77WU|5.0|Would recommend . The actors did a great job portraying  June and Johnny. Like a lot of singers and actors,  he had a hard time dealing with his fame.

B00AOCLWF6|4.0|Simply a nail biting awesome show. I have pre-teen to teen age kids and we watch as a family.  The heart of the show is family.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book was very good. I read it in half an hour. Was slightly scary but I had no nightmares
B0094K1WZE|5.0|As usual lots of action; visual and special effects, Tom Cruise and Brad Bird do not disappoint in this delivery of Mission Impossible it keeps you entertained from beginning to end. Very recommendable.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great app. Good to play with friends and new friends. Graphics are really good. Achievements are good. Great that you can help out others too.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is worth the download. I would recommend this even if you haven't seen the movie. It had nothing to do with the story from the movies.
B00571F26Y|1.0|He just rambled on and on and on. I just couldn't continued reading this book. It was very boring and lacked something
B000AR9YQ4|5.0|i love all the songs.. Listening to  Fire In The Blood always makes me happy.. and I love More than I an Bear so much...
B000001FDK|5.0|THE MUSIC WAS WONDERFUL. I SANG ALONG WITH THE WHOLE CD. IF YOU SEEN GREASE. YOU WILL ALSO ENJOY AND REMEMBER THE FUN. ENJOY
B008OM0EDO|5.0|Sacha Baron Cohen is incredibly funny in this movie. We could not stop laughing!  But beware! if you are super sensitive or conservative you better stay away, this may not be for you. You need to relax and have an open mind to watch and enjoy the movie.
0345536886|5.0|I read this book for our book club. We really enjoyed it. Then I sent it to my granddaughter for her birthday because she is studying criminal justice. She too enjoyed it. It brought a few good laughs.
B005DJREJS|5.0|Very well written, clever, funny - really enjoyed it! Great show for any age, young adult to adult (I am 31).
B005XUC398|4.0|Anyone still interested in what goes on in investment firms will enjoy this,<br />a good reminder of what the business is all about. Great actors.
B002W1UEW4|1.0|Not even a distraction - bad acting and cheesy plot - don't bother..and don't show it to your kids - bahhhhh
B00BUAEYVK|4.0|NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST DIE HARD. A OK STORY LINE. BUT, THERE IS PLENTY OF ACTION.  IF YOU LIKE ACTION. THIS A GOOD ONE FOR IT.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book touches home to so many and as heartbreaking as it is to read you can't put it down
1478230096|5.0|This was a great book.  Very long but very good. I will probably read it again. What a great book!!!
B00000099Y|5.0|If the successor species can decode the information and decipher our language, they'd understand Tool as one of the messengers of our fate in the last days.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|love this case! so easy to charge my Legend and protects it while im not using it. ive had this for a month now and have only had to recharge it once!!!!
B007HO392S|5.0|I WAS blown away by her beautiful choice of songs, incl. &#34;Black Cadilac&#34; and &#34;Blown Away.&#34; The others, perhaps a little less known, were gorgeous as well. You won't be disappointed if you buy this album!!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My only complaint is that when you first start, you have virtually no idea what you're doing. I believe that having a tutorial or a practice round would be very helpful. That way, you'd know which objects you need to jump over and which objects you need to roll under before you start playing and have to start over every time you encounter something you're not sure how to handle.Also, you'd know that there are helpful items to gather along the way, not just the bananas.
B000FA5STS|5.0|I enjoyed this book completely. Lee Sawyer is an experienced FBI agent who encounters a mysterious plane crash caused by a bomb and a considerable array of suspects. Jason Archer is a computer whiz who seems to be involved in the bombing and/or the looting of many millions of dollars from his company. His beautiful wife, Sydney Archer, is suspected of aiding him. She is also a sharp lawyer for the same firm Jason works for. There are many aspects to this case. There are three large companies interconnected at the top with several layers of shady executives, all trying to mess things up for each other (typical American business it seems). The Chairman of the Federal Reserve looks like the target of the airplane bomb.<br /><br />There is good action and suspense carried throughout this rather long book. The final battle scene between an FBI HRT unit, a mercenary and gangster unit, Lee Sawyer and Sydney is carried out in a snow storm on the coast of Maine.
B0045HCIZY|5.0|Quite a good, easy to watch beginning to this 3-part love story.  We watching the second in the series, Before Sunset, the following evening and together they made a wonderful, romantic adventure.  I'm so excited to see the final in the trilogy.
0312567448|4.0|This is an easy fun read I enjoyed it very much.  I am old fashioned in a way and like the art of letter writing, a dying art.
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|Whitney was another gifted person to bad she abused and didn't understand the value of her gift.  Hopefully her life can be a lesson for those who will come behind her.
B00B1ME3DQ|4.0|Much, much better than Strange Cousins From the West; Earth Rocker is a very solid Clutch album.<br />While the past two albums have strayed away from the blues influence that dominated the band's releases of the 2000's, that is not necessarily a bad thing. Earth Rocker is the even more of a rock album than to Pure Rock Furry. This is not surprising when you look at all the metal bands they have been touring with the past 4 years. Unlike SCFtW, Earth Rocker has a clear point of view and a tone that ties all the songs together much like Elephant Riders.
B008MM9630|1.0|I'm getting rid of this one. It is very boring. Graphics remind me of the original Nintendo. Really, they could have done much better with this!
B00C6B7GTE|5.0|A cult favorite, could possibly become the movie that Jeff Bridges is most remembered for... the kind of movie you watch over and over until you can recite the dialogue along with the movie.
B0002YLC24|5.0|Met my expectations and them some.  So enjoyable to get away to a foreign country and re-live young love.  Absolutely loved it!
0812420039|3.0|Hemingway delivered as expected, great story.  However, when I ordered a hardback edition I didn't expect it to be the version provided to grade school children, complete with censorship.  The overall size of the book and quality of the cover were not what I had expected.  Maybe you should consider flagging this as the &#34;adolescent version&#34;.
B008Y6OJGI|4.0|Wasn't quite all I expected but it was good, lots of action.  Usually if I really love a movie it sticks in my mind... this one I'm having a little difficulty recalling the end (I watched it only about 3 or so weeks ago).
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|This was the first book that I had read of Jodi Picoults and it is made me look for more. It also gave me an insight into a world I new very little about.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its sol much fun!!!! u get to do a lot of different competitions and feed itand everything and it really passes time!!
034580404X|5.0|Of continuing the story and keeping you excited about them,<br />although a bit mistified!  I think it was well worth the time and expense<br />and I will lend it out so others can enjoy.  People need to keep in mind,<br />it is fiction!!!
B002PMV9FG|3.0|I was very disappointed to find that captions are only offered in French.  I can read Spanish but not French.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|A vey good fairy tale brought to life, lots of fun for the whole family. I will watch it again.
B000002VSN|5.0|Whitney was another gifted person to bad she abused and didn't understand the value of her gift. Hopefully her life can be a lesson for those who will come behind her.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|This is an awesome show for all.  surprisingly entertaining for someone who normally wouldn't watch this type of show.  definately recommend!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is the best free game I've ever played. I like the controls because they are the same as the original Temple Run. This version has ziplines, caves with carts, waterfalls and new powerups. The new powerups include a powerup that if you hit a fallen tree or something like that (not including getting swept by the waterfall or missed jumps.)  Get this game! It's better than the original!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Hard to use new version I hate this.  Maps don't load fast location doesn't map right.  Hate it<br />Hate it hate it
B001UV4XIS|4.0|Best of all Harry Potter movies, and it includes captions in English.That's all I have to say about this product.
B00114RKT8|5.0|Excellently written!! Metaxas brings a time long past to vivid life. Wilberforce comes to life through the words of this author, he's no longer a historical figure to me, but a living, breathing hero!
B009CF7GRY|4.0|I was worried that the integrity of the movie would be lost but it was a wonderful surprise.  I enjoyed it!
0762451319|3.0|I was super excited for my kit to come in the mail. I had no idea the entire box of the kit is SUPER SMALL. Like 2 inches in height small.<br /><br />I had pre-ordered it, looking forward to both the tattoos and necklace. The necklace is made quite well - probably worth the entire $10 price tag. Keep in mind it is short though. I put it on and it reaches just around my neck. There's no extra length - think choker style. I have plenty of chains in silver but will need a darker one that is a bit longer. The booklet that is included is super small and the magnets seem okay. Would I recommend this? If you want the necklace then yes. For just the tattoos it's pricey and for the book, it's an extra bonus but I wouldn't buy it for the book or magnets alone.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This was a great story! It was the first I have read of this author's. It kept me reading right up to the very end. I plan to read it again to see if I &#34;missed&#34; any clues the first time through. I highly recommend this book!
B002PEP4U0|5.0|Our Book Club read the Boy Who Harnessed the Wind and our discussion was lively.  We found ourselves  recognizing the creativity, dedication to family and other qualities of Willaim, the lead character and considering how these are encouraged - or not - in our American culture.  Along with discussing Afruican culture and this particular young man, th topic led us inot consideration of wind turbines and sources or energy possible to meet worl needs while conserving resources and their moral implications. This book is a quick and easy read and one comes away enjoying the book and admiring the character and outlook of this young African boy.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Much better than the film. This book follows a timeline through a ten year war on the undead through short interviews with survivors. The first interview focuses on &#34;subject zero&#34; and a clear view of the outbreak unfolds as interviews are given by various survivors from soldiers to hackers to the political elite. One of the most surprising aspects of this book is the focus on how the different world governments handled the zombie threat in drastically different ways. A must for any zombie fan!
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Fun but too much info going on and very little instruction about what<br />really is going on around the game
B006SAR6P8|4.0|I can't decide if it's asgood as the first,but it is so entertaining.Tarantino never disappoints,though his latest didn't appeal to me.If you own the first as I do,you'll want this in your collection.
B004UID2LC|5.0|It's great knowing that if youtube later deletes the video from their service, (for whatever the reason), I will still always have that video on my hard-drive. FREEdi could not be any easier to use !!!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|fun very addictive... catch my self losing track of time... kids enjoy it as well... play on car rides... recommended...
B008OOYALE|1.0|Love this game, but I just installed an update, and now it takes way more food to do anything. It was hard enough to raise the dragons before, but it's ridiculous now. Uninstalled.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I like the game, its fun to play. But I dislike that you can only visit three friends a day.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|What can I say? I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL SEASON 4 BEGINS!! If you're not a Downton Abbey watcher......GO get yourself hooked!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The previous weather channel app was awesome but the new one, updated in July, sucks. A LARGE part of the screen is now covered with adds which  makes the radar map unhandy.  I get it's a free app and there will be ads but they take up like 1/3 of the screen now and that's too much. The whole new layout is counterintuitive . TWC was the first app I installed on my KFHD but I will be looking for a different weather app now.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|One of the best fantasy books I've read in awhile!  Awesome creativity and writing makes you feel like you're immersed in the story!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I think if you've watched all of Season 1 and 2, you're already hooked enough to finish the series.  Season 3 was just as good as the other seasons.  I look forward to the next season, but it's not like some fast paced series where I absolutely can't wait to watch the next episode immediately.<br /><br />I've come to really appreciate Maggie Smith's one-liners. :)
B003M6EAXM|3.0|Not awful, but far from the best season - some franchises just seem to go on a bit too long
1609611543|5.0|I read this book at it changed how I view food and wheat. I went off gluten shortly after reading this book. I thought it would be WAY hard for a hardcore lover of anything bread. But Davis' research and findings were enough for me to try, and after a week of bread 'detoxing' it became easy to not eat it, and I felt WAY better because of it! In my opinion, this is a MUST READ!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book!<br />Love the relationship between the characters. Really draws you into the story.  The leading characters inner turmoil makes the readers really connect with them.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Played these games for hours while recovering from the flu. I would recover this to any one who is a puzzle fiend.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|It is challenging buit is very time consuming. I also don't like that you have to firm the music off every time you launch the app
B003TSEL7S|4.0|i read it for my grandson it was a good one for him a nice easy start to reading sys
B0076DEJMO|5.0|Great read that has a few old characters in a new light and introduces several new ones. I was not that impressed with the &#34;western&#34; tie in but it works well enough.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|This is the best Les Miserables performance I have ever seen, even considering Russell Crowe.<br />Cannot pick my favorite part, it is all good.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I found this a little slow in places but stick with it because it is also hilariously funny. If you like Sheldon from Big Bang Theory then you will love this book!
0307352153|2.0|The book is very interesting, however very much a challenge to read, even with glasses. The publisher must be using 6 pt. I would recommend the book, however DO NOT buy print version unless you want to use a magnifying glass, only the Kindle version.
B00APYKXFS|2.0|The music isn't interesting, the game play is simplistic and not consistent.  Would get hit but noth registered as being hit, no indication of health decreasing or armor.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love is game.  It is so much fun to play.  and it also keep you thinking. and it has a lot of level to play.  This is a fun game to play. and I highly recommend this app.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|Really enjoyed this first installment, introduces some string characters, some good, some evil, and most conflicted in between. Highly recommend.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|Funny cause it's true. Great soundtrack too. I'd watch it again fo'sho! Both the wife and I aughed outloud many times.
B003KK6GOQ|5.0|I loved the way this novel was narrated - very clever. I read this cover to cover in one sitting and would highly recommend it to anyone.
B004GYY714|5.0|This app not only offers music stations from all different genres, but also offers sports, news, and talk radio stations.  You can also find stations in other countries and in different languages.  Such an awesome app!!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|It is fast moving and clever. I liked it so much I wish it had been longer but otherwise it was perfect.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Couldn't stop watching after the first episode!<br />The acting is outstanding and the plot weaves you through fear, empathy and excitement.
B00BBW15R8|5.0|Excellent movie! It's been a while I haven't seen such a strong movie. I strongly recommend it... it's worth watching!
B002GYI9C4|5.0|This book was a lot of fun to read. The characters were easy to connect to and the fight scenes were well written.
B00AE2KZNQ|5.0|I liked the true account of the live's of the Bondurant Brothers and the &#34;moonshining&#34; business from the 30's. It held my attention from start to finish.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I love the show. I have watch from the very beginning of the show. I moved to a new apartment in November. I had to change from DirecTV to Time Warner. So somehow I missed the January and February shows. So I am very glad that I was able to get the Season 2, because I knew when I went to watch Season 3 I had missed at least the Season Finale.  This show gets better each season, and it doesn't think that Season 3 will disappoint me.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|A fun , suspenseful trip into our nostalgic past  and our very foreseeable future. Well written characters and imagery that has you feeling that you are right there with Wade Watts in reality and in the next phase of virtual reality. If you've lived thru the 80's or not you will thoroughly enjoy the references and pop culture glorification of the era portrayed by this book. I can't wait for his next book
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I absolutely love this game, however, I am having issues when it comes to logging in to my Facebook on my kindle. I have this game on my phone and its logged in to my Facebook but it's not letting me on the kindle. So I don't know what is going on with that. Overall, this game is a blast of fun!! Recommend!!!
B008LVCKH6|3.0|It was an interesting story with humor. Have not read a book like this before. Worth the time to read it.
B0043LYXJ6|5.0|I just love these movies! Always have and my fiance got these for me for my birthday this past year and they are even better on Blu-Ray!
0062255657|1.0|Kept my interest but had a very disappointing ending.  I kept thinking that it would all make sense in the end.  I was wrong.  I felt like I wasted my time reading this book that left me very frustrated in the end.  A waste of time and money.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the plot and the characters including Darryl, Michonne and Rick. I can't wait for the next season 4.
B001EC2IXK|5.0|Haven't seen it in a while.  This movie still holds up after all these years.  Great performances by all, and of course, Paul Newman.
B00CISAPJS|4.0|Nicholas Hoult is a great comic actor in the making.  I really look forward to anything else he does in the future.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Engaging, stimulating,and a feast for the eyes. Once you start watching, it's almost impossible to stop. The bonus features added an invaluable insight to the characters and action
B002SJKWZ4|5.0|Packaging is good...wand is great.  this was a gift for a friend who is learning how to use it.  I love that there are specific hand motions/movements that make this work and it takes some practice...of course...it is after all a wand.
B00007BKVC|5.0|Movie reviews can drone on and on, so I'll keep it simple: This movie is something I wish would happen in our culture.  It's an amazing story that focuses on two amazing women (gasp!) who actually decide to fight back and enjoy their lives.  There's a lot here to delve into, but it's a great story and an amazingly well-executed film.
B002N15LFS|5.0|So I bought the double-LP version of this album and was blown away - Cosmic Egg is truly one of those few compilations out there in which you can actually listen to the entire album and not get bored with it - As an album, I give it five stars. One issue with the vinyl though, most of the songs are not in correct order as listed on the back of the cover art box AND the records themselves. Looked it up on the internet and this is the case for every Cosmic Egg vinyl edition as the records were incorrectly pressed by a second party. Still, its not too big a deal for me (this also increases the value of the record) and I definitely recommend purchasing this - a MUST HAVE for rock fans!
B002MQYOFW|2.0|A very predictable tale which will enrapture sophomoric minds. I would have loved it in fifth grade. But for an adult, it's banal and transparent. Nonetheless, I can see where it will attract hoards of rabid fans, as do the equally trite Steig Larsson snoozefests, making plenty of money for plenty of people for something of very little of merit.
B00CWVGS10|3.0|I've never read the book but think I need to now.  Sorry to say, the movie seemed to be missing something.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Now one of my best Apps.  I do not have to search for it again as it is here now.  I have 2 best Apps my mail and now EBAY.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|II wish Richard could have spoken a bit plainer at times, some was hard to know what he was saying but over all, I loved this movie;
B000EBD9TY|4.0|This was one of Marlon Brando's best dramatic movies.  I would recommend it to Brando fans and those who like old dramatic movies.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|I remember watching this movie when it first came out and just loving it, All these years later watching it with my daughter and seeing the joy it brought to her was magic.
1616550414|5.0|To see the look on my grandson's face when he opened this gift was worth all of the money in the world.  Let's face it, kids today are way more technology advanced than we ever were.  This book is so detailed about the legend of Zelda that I could probably read the whole thing and still not understand what I had read.  The illustrations are magnificent!  I think my grandson, who is an avid reader, will be absorbed in this book until school starts again in he fall.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|The movie and story was not at all what I expected.  It had a &#34;Christian&#34; undertone which was something about the movie I really enjoyed.  The special effects were spectacular and the story had a surprise ending which left you wondering about what really happened.
B008Y5UADK|3.0|I got this thinking wow the movie about the kid and tiger!!  (Being an Amazon Prime subscriber helped wit the cost.  A little push for Amazon!) Well PI is not &#34;Life of PI 2009 movie) .  It was OK to watch as I watched almost half before I realized it.  To say the least is was entertaining.  It reminded me of the movie with Jim Carrey called &#34;23&#34;or the TV Series &#34;Touch&#34; both dealing with numbers. In this one it is more of a curse but it have both humorous and serious consequences  It was not great and it was not a &#34;Dirty Rotten Tomato&#34;.  It was interesting.  So if you have a little time to kill watch it.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Terrific movie - true story. Sandra bullock plays a different kind of role and is a superstar in it. Gripping story and well acted.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|This app is really good value. The front graphic for the app looks really cheesy, but don't let that fool you (like me!). You can opt for specific area exercises (legs/abs/upper body) or the full workout. I was impressed with the looping video instruction. This works really well with a Kindle. And (the make or break for me) is that it works without Wifi!! That alone makes it 5 stars for me!
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|I don't mind that they have ads I mean its expected. but when I try to exit out of one on the home screen it automatically takes me out of the app and into the web browser. I also do not have a FaceBook and its kind of annoying that they are always pressuring me to add an account. I think it's kind of ridiculous that you have to wait close to an hour to get tokens to play (scratch offs) and then they only give you a few.  There are still a few glitches like sometimes I have to try several times to hit &quot;play&quot; because the game will not register it even though I have enough money. Overall the game is very fun and I enjoy playing it when I can. The quality is amazing and I never have to wait long for other players.
1590171993|5.0|Such a slow start, I wasn't sure if I wanted or needed to continue past the first 20 pages which took me days to read. Then, I reached a point where it all changed. I wasn't able to sleep and was compelled to keep reading it. I'm a slow reader but this is not a book to dash through. The descriptions of setting are rich and the characters richer.  Much of the time I thought of my grandfather whose life's events paralleled those of Prof. Stoner, but most of all I thought of my own life and how it is mine to live within the world I find myself.  I might be reading too much into it, but a favorite passage is when Stoner offers opening comments in a freshman English course for which he has decided to alter the curriculum to suit what he believes should be taught.  He speaks of the study of the material to be covered but he is really speaking of approaching one's own life, \\"Certain accidents of history will stand in our way; there will be linguistic difficulties as well as philosophical, social as well as religious, theoretical as well as practical. Indeed, all of our past education will in some ways hinder us; for our habits of thinking about the nature of experience have determined our own expectations...\\"<br />And later, in the fading light of his life when his thoughts drift between what he dreamed of before and what he found, he asks himself, \\"What did you expect?\\"  So, we are charged to ask ourselves, what do we expect?<br /><br />Rich and rewarding.
1416594787|5.0|Everybody raves about &#34;The god delusion&#34; but this is so much more educational without being boring. Its full of facts with plenty of examples for everything he lays out.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Great game but annoying how you have to connect it with all social media to get cash to build stuff
B00005N5S2|5.0|Gregory Peck is the best MacArthur performance ever.  You should get this and save it as a collector's item. Save it for the kids.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|This book was very good<br />and very adventurous as there was much betrayals and stuff like that. THAT'S<br /> the stuff I like!!!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I chose this rate because product is 100% useful for my dislike anything nome actually the opposite product I like is very useful product would recommend it to those people who in one way or another need to be current on their things people like me the time is essential for life
B00CFYD682|5.0|New and as promised!!!  No problems what so ever!!!  Sealed and no cracks in the cd case!!!  So easy breezy!!!
B004ZY0VHY|4.0|Very interesting account of a mother who has had misgivings about her son since the day he was born.  She chronicles his life in very disturbing detail  This is a book that will stay with you for a long time to come. Be prepared with a dictionary when you read this. Shrivel uses almost every SAT vocabulary word you have ever heard of (or not).
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the game it JUST like subway suffers but it's despicable me and it's fun when your bord and so so so ya um well that all peace out
0525478817|5.0|Five stars.<br /><br />---<br /><br />I'm going to deviate from my normal review format when reflecting upon this book. I feel that this novel is more deserving of a mess of plus marks and minus signs, of pros and cons. This review will be half of my opinion, and probably more directed towards the fictional characters of the story, and less towards the nonfictional people who read my thoughts on books. For that, I am sorry that I am not sorry.<br /><br />If teenage Hazel is anything, it is that she is no stranger to thinking about life and death, though namely the latter. She has lungs that do not know how to be lungs, and though a new medicine is lessening her suffering, she has been diagnosed with terminal cancer. It is at her cancer support group that she meets Augustus Waters, a cancer-free survivor with a prosthetic leg and an interesting take on the world around him.<br /><br />Hazel and Augustus are the most beautiful couple that I have ever read about. Keeping in the theme of the title of this story, it is the faults of these characters that make them so intriguing, relatable, and completely unforgettable.<br /><br />Every word, from Hazel's internal thoughts to the pair's dialogue and everything in between is smartly and stunningly written. Each word is no doubt strategically placed by one John Green to make this book flow with undertones of love, haunting, and a strange metaphysical feeling that made me personally feel both like the universe is leaps and bounds bigger than myself and that I am nothing more than a speck in an infinity of lives lived.... But at the same time felt a sense of this life is what you make it, and so you must live today all that you can. Who knows if tomorrow will be your Last Good Day?<br /><br />Augustus is a boy that I would have felt privileged to know. He shares a lot of similarities with other book leads- sweet, funny, likable. But there's something more to that. He had this intellectual wit and view point that made him seem both quirky and wise beyond his seventeen years of life. He was strong, and romantic (even if it wasn't so subtle). And the extent to which that he loved Hazel is awe-inspiring and heartbreaking simultaneously.<br /><br />And then there is Hazel. Her thoughts seem so rational and sensible to the point that they at times seem cold. I like that her thoughts follow this darkened pattern with bursts of bright optimism and worth. Both characters just loved each other so harshly and so fully, it consumed everyone around them. Strangers, family, friends- everyone could see just how much the pair cared for one another, and it was lovely. I can't help but to think of an Edgar Allan Poe quote to describe them: \\"But we loved with a love that was more than love.\\"<br /><br />I am pretty sure that I felt every possible emotion during the course of this novel. I admittedly cried more than once. I got the warm fuzzy \\"aw\\" feeling that one sees when two old people are holding hands, or when a puppy and a kitten are curled up together in a box. I felt inexplicably happy and laughed, I grew sad and I mourned. I cheered characters on, cursed others, grew angry, frustrated, and confused with their actions.<br /><br />Now that I have finished reading, I just have this weird sense of.... Well. I am acutely aware of the fact that I am alive. I can feel my pulse in my neck, I am hypersensitive to the breeze wafting towards me from the vent. I just.... Feel.<br /><br />I must state here, since this is a review, that I am very blessed and fortunate enough to not know anyone who is suffering with cancer. I do have to specify, using Hazel's words, that this book is a cancer book, not a \\"cancer book\\"- there is so much else going on. Because I can not relate to the level of illness and stress in this book, I must say that if you do know someone, this book may be all the more meaningful and heartbreaking to you.<br /><br />I feel that this is a book that deserves to be read by everyone and anyonewho is able to read, and those who cannot should make someone read it to them aloud. Five is the highest number of stars that I can allot, and I assure you that I have found no fault in them.<br /><br />Thank you to the Christi the Teen Librarian blog for my signed copy of this book.who is able to read, and those who cannot should make someone read it to them aloud.

B00BWJARHO|5.0|Having read the book, I can say that the movie truly was well done. worth the money and my time.
1451613512|5.0|This is a fabulous companion to Zinn's People's History of the United States. Supported by 100 pages of notes and references, it details U.S. foreign policy and intervention around the world since the Spanish American War up through the Obama administration, which shockingly has expanded on the neocon policies of the Bush administration. It appropriately starts out with the now famous admission of General Smedley Butler in his book \\"War is a Racket\\",  that our military who fought in the Philippines, China and Central America was a \\" high class muscle-man for big business, for Wall Street and for the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism\\". This book is a sobering and sad look at each of the many tragic and unnecessary wars, military coups and covert operations we have been involved in over the last century to support our economic and geopolitical interests abroad. The U.S. has evolved to become a country which believes it has an unalienable right to act as a global judge, jury and executioner, and in so doing remain beyond the reach of any court of law including UN rules of intercourse between sovereign nations. If you want to expand your knowledge beyond The Pentagon Papers I highly recommend this book. I think an enlightened public is the only hope for positive change. Meanwhile understand the disparity between the haves and have nots continues to grow unmitigated not only here but in all other countries. The top 1% in the U.S have more wealth than the bottom 90% and abroad there are about 3 billion people living on $1-2 per day. Life is good for the Super-Elite (0.1 %) and promises to get even better with all the tools in place designed to keep this disparity into perpetuity.
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|I'm a sucker for a romance and science fiction. I love the premise - very clever.  And it's a happy movie.  Can't beat that.
B00BLRXDTQ|5.0|Loved Mad Max since its start during my childhood.<br />Great picture quality, sound and great having the series to follow up on.<br />Good collection.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I downloaded this game on my phone and it was fun....but when it finally became available for download to my kindle....Well I became addicted! So much more fun on a bigger screen...once I start playing it's hard to stop. Love this game!
B000LGZHDS|5.0|I bought this cause it reminded me of my bf who is also named gary but i wasn't sure which one to buy but i ended up buying this one cause it was the brand name Ty which i've loved since i was a little kid.  The product was delivered on time and it's exactly the same in the picture as in real life.  It's one good quality product.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I saw a documentary on Rodriguez and fell in love with his music! Cold Fact is a very good album.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I really enjoyed his book.  I wish I had kept a &#34;cast of characters&#34; list to help me keep track.
1844257797|5.0|I just got a new 2003 R1130R BMW (only 1270 miles!) and want and need to do my own maintenance. I want to see this bike go beyond 200,000 miles so will stay ahead of the reaper with regular maintenance. This manual is an easy read and follow guide. Well illustrated with pictures and full of the technical data you need. I couldn't find any BMW shop manuals so 3rd party is welcome.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Weird and yet entertaining. I didn't really understand the storyline because I think the makers were trying to be too mysterious but the game was so different from most games that it wasn't all bad. I actually really liked the puzzles. Good 2 hours spent actually thinking instead of slashing fruit or something.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it's fun and very fun I really like it cause I'm good at itbsnd Tbilisi game is like famous.
B005YPJ62E|5.0|If I could afford to get a copy for everybody I know...I would! I listen to it over and over again.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|I've already reviewed in Google Play Store at length, so let me just say this...if you have need of this type of program, go no further than Splashtop 2. It does everything the description says it will and more. My tablet does not run flash even though the Samsung specs page says it does, because Adobe discontinued support. With this app enabled, I can literally run my desktop and its IE9 brower (flash enabled) on my tablet, using the desktop's browser rather the one native to this device to surf flash required sites and games. The only downside that many seem to complain about is that it's only free for your home network, there is a SMALL subscription fee to use it all over the world!!! What the hell, people, for something that works this well, pony up a couple of dollars!!! Any of the ones complaining about having to pay willing to go to work today for free??? I thought not!
B005XOPEOU|4.0|I have heard the  live version of the album and in my opinion may be better than the original album. Unfortunately it seems hard to find.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|You'll get your money's worth with this one. I've invested about 4 hours into playing this game so far and only completed 2 chapters(there's 5ch + bonus). For me, what makes this type of game fun is the amount and the quality of interactive entertainment I get out of it. G5 really delivers with this one. I'm enthralled. Amazing graphics, great scene set up, awesome story/plot and it's original. It just keeps going and going with games and puzzles, no lagging time. The puzzles are pure enjoyment, not too difficult and not too easy. Just perfect. Regarding this genre, this game is top-notch on all aspects.
B00338QENI|4.0|Good background information accompanied by a thoughtful and compassionate look at the family and the researchers. Great research. Good research
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I love this game.it's more fun than I had expected,and it has kept me excited and entertained the hole time
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Thought that season three lived up to the anticipation.<br />The acting is superb which is hard when competing with<br />the beauty of the mansion. The last scene was a stunner!<br />l
B0064QNS62|1.0|Just all around not my cup of tea. I personally found it hard to control with any real precision, although I'm sure that a lot of that fault lies with me, as I much prefer the old joysticks in gaming systems. The app itself tended to &#34;stick&#34; while running on my phone and I saw no real reason to try installing it on my tablet, bugs not withstanding, because the whole concept was eons old and boring enough that I didn't really care if it would run on my tablet or not. Not a terrible app, just not one worth caring about.
B00A85EMVK|1.0|I couldn't believe how absolutely AWFUL the BluRay 3D version of this movie was.  Horribly grainy---pure junk!  At first, I thought the opening scenes were just grainy on purpose, a sort of special effect.  But as the movie continued I was thoroughly disgusted.  I have never seen any DVD or even VHS tape that was as unwatchable as this. I turned it off after a few minutes of trying to get it to play decently by fiddling with the settings---nothing I did made any difference.  IT'S THE DISC.<br />This is definitely an issue with the disc, NOT my equipment.  There have been no issues with any other 3D disc I've played.  In fact, I popped in a Jurassic Park 3D disc after I tried the crappy Top Gun 3D disc and JP was perfect.  In contrast to Top Gun, Jurassic Park is an excellent conversion.<br />All my video and audio equipment, BTW, is less than three months old.<br />The Top Gun BluRay non-3D disc was fine.<br />Worst thing is, I bought two copies of this piece of junk, intending to give one as a gift.  ANGRY!!<br />DON'T BUY THIS IF YOU'RE BUYING IT FOR THE 3D VERSION!!!!
B001FB55I0|5.0|Great movie and blu ray. Just needed it to complete my set. So now I can sit and relax with the kids
B00915G6WQ|5.0|This was a gift for my son's girlfriend.  She loves this show and thus I have rated it as such.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game, fun places to visit, very challenging at times on the hard to get items. I recommend playing one card at a time to save your credits longer!!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|While this book was not my favorite Demille book (Plum Island & Nightfall are) it was very good, was a little slow at first but really picked up in the second half. I love any story with John Corey, he is always enjoyable! Can't wait for the next one!
B0088P2A7A|5.0|Wikipedia is one of those sites that has clickable link on all of my browsers in all of my devices. No matter WHAT the topic, Wikipedia has some type of info listed. Keep in mind that, as I'm pretty sure, a large majority of the info posted comes from fellow Wikipedia patrons and the info should occasionally be vetted through other sites, depending on the importance of the research. Also, the informational subject pages have one of the most clearly structured and easy to use set-ups that I have ever seen, with a section/sub-section type structure that also, towards the end, lists every informational source, loosely resembling an index format. It also provides clickable links to other sources and sites related to the topic at hand.<br /><br />Wikipedia...learn it, use it, love it, lol!
B00499NHLC|5.0|Loved it. Clever story lines and jokes. I also enjoyed the episodes being 90 min. I cant wait to watch season 2.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|Great movie and blu ray. Just needed it to complete my set. So now I can sit and relax with the kids
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Thank you Amazon for helping me find just what I wanted.it is great!! At a great price, too. You're the best!
B0052RDHTM|2.0|Amateurish writing.  Gratuitous not sexy intimacy.  Tedious.  Am plodding through only because I promised a friend I would read it.  A big waste of my time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love this game. level 10 is tricky but it is fun to play. if you like a challenge, you will love this game.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Great movie. Showed it to my 4 year old grandson how enjoyed the gadgets in the movie. Very entertaining. I thought it was good also.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|Covers most topics from the book by silly characters in a silly plot. Comical at times, but so ridiculous that I'm glad it was free on Amazon Prime...
B00CMQX84A|5.0|Teen Beach Movie blew my expectations. Watched it with my 5 year old niece and she loved it! Instant hit. We ended up watching 2 times over the weekend and now we can't wait for the DVD to arrive. The music was incredibly well done.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Name of the wind has got to be one of the best books I read.<br />Wise Man's Fear had to be amazing to be a good sequel.<br />It did not disappoint.<br /><br />There are so many layers and messages and the Patrick Rothfuss does a fantastic job.<br />I have not met a single person who didn't like this book.<br />It is a must read.<br /><br />It's not a simple read. It's is a deceptively brilliant book. Can not wait for the next book.
B002MFV2IK|4.0|Just one of those timeless funny movies.  My sons that are 14 and 16 believe anything made before 2010 is old and dumb. They loved this!
B008M0NDOK|3.0|Frankly I am yet to play any game using this (will update once I get enough time to play one), but I am writing this review because I liked the stand that came with this a lot (got this for 8 bucks). It is worth it for the stand alone.<br />But a warning, this controller will most likely be not supported by iOS7 (that comes with inbuilt support for controllers. The games that work with it currently will work but it most PROBABLY won't support iOS7). So if you have been looking for a good stand buy this ($7 as of right now). For gaming  read other reviews.
B0056BU3I2|5.0|This is a great movie! I purchased this because i was completing my Fast collection. I ordered this because of the price. I received the regular DVD, BluRay, and a digital copy. I can watch the digital copy on my Kindle. Great value for all the copies!
B00DYTKKGI|4.0|Good game for kids why I give it 4stars is because you have to by the rest of the stuff and think you should just be able to use everything for free.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I realy like this book, it abute forbiten love, frend shipe, famely and it is abute monster that is in you'r mine
B009ZQC7MY|2.0|To me this season didn't have as much to offer as the previous one. A couple of the story lines I didn't like either. I think at this point the only character I like is Anna. Not as much history, too much societal political stuff. The loss of two main characters doesn't make me excited for season four. I also agree that the changing of moral character of someone without anything bringing about that change...something just didn't follow in that story line at all. Won't go any further as I don't want to give away too much to those who have not seen it. Not near as excited about any future ones.... They ran out of story lines.
B002JXK5VU|2.0|Just too much over the top invention fiasco stuff...like those shows that use any person with a computer to hack whatever there is in the world. And the guy just takes it all too much as ease. Often feels like a never-ending halloween party. I would like that diner down my street, though. But not with people always popping up unexpectedly and for nothing.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|The characters we love and hate or love to hate are brought to life with even more finesse. More visual descriptions than T.V. could ever portray, yet keeping with the fast paced action.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|I enjoy the TV show and wanted to read one of the books and I am very glad I did. I already liked the characters so getting into the book was easy and it made for a great way to spend an afternoon in the &#34;heat&#34;of the summer.
B000HL2J0G|4.0|MacGyver is a timeless series with which to pass the time and rest your brain. I love it. My grown kids (well, some of them) love it.
B004GKMV16|2.0|Was a little disappointed with the mish mash of characters, plots and scenes.  The historical detail elements of everyday life and details pertaining to the London's early days were interesting but the individualised plots of each family became a little dull and monotonous.  I admit I had pre concieved expectations of a brilliant historical saga not dissimilar to PIllars of the earth but instead got an inconsistantly wrtten jumble of short stories all of which I felt ended poorly.  I am only half way through and are disinclined to read any further die to unimaginative character development, drama and chapter conclusions. While I sympathise that the extent of the era's attempted was immence, I'd rather read a well written story covering 3 days of rapture than 3 milleniums of underdeveloped predictability. Sorry...
B00064WSNW|5.0|Discipline (1981) was the first King Crimson album in seven years, following the critically acclaimed Red from 1974. With a fresh new attitude, coupled with changes to the musical landscape (new wave in particular), Crimson set out to record something that longtime fans had never heard before, nor expected: a fusion of new wave and progressive rock. The great thing about Discipline is the fact that it was very well received by fans, while garnering new fans as well. Also, a new sound necessitated recruiting new musicians, as Adrian Belew and Tony Levin provided yet another premium on talent, on guitar, vocals, and the Chapman stick, respectively. Belew's vocals are smooth and provide great range, and his guitar is superb. The album starts out with a rather unusual track, ELEPHANT TALK, which is a lot like something that Talking Heads did. This track is the perfect opener, and is very catchy. Oh, and the elephant sounds are a bonus. A very welcome treat can be found in track 3 (MATTE KUDASAI) which is a slower piece filled with emotion. This track is worth the price of the album. Another stellar track is THE SHELTERING SKY, which has many interesting sounds, and a 'far away' feel to it. The rest of the album consists of solid songs that bring out the excellent musicianship of this tremendously talented group. On Discipline, expect the unexpected, and expect a wide variety of genres with a progressive foundation. I highly recommend this masterpiece, along with the second installment (Beat) and third installment (Three of a Perfect Pair). 10/10
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Too slow for older kids and the items to click on are too small for young kids...at least it was free.
B0063IH60K|3.0|game worked fine for a long time, now it crashes when loading even after reinstall. also the ads are annoying.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game. Kids will love it if they love horse's. I love this game so much. Thank you.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved it!  One of the best mini series I have seen in a long time. Set decoration and costumes beautiful.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|IS A POCKET AND POTENT FLASH. GOOD FOR LONG DISTANCE PICTURES, MORE OR LESS 30 METERS, WITHOUT RED EYES AND LIGHTENING IS SMOOTH.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|The story is told through a series of after-the-fact vignettes, not a traditional linear storyline. The writing is excellent and the story is interesting, but the format doesn't allow for much tension, drama, or a climactic finale. Just wasn't what I was wanting at the time.
B005HED11Y|5.0|I was raised with this classic!  They never turned it into a soap opera...That was they key.  No huggy, kissy (only on a few episodes) then back to original.  Try this even if  you never saw it.  Jim is so good looking.
B0053ZOQMK|5.0|Very cute! May not catch attention all the way through for the real young ones- but definitely a very unique animation and great characters! Probably caters more to the adults- but the kids enjoyed it too!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's an amazing game. Even though it's a little pricey, it's great. I thought, when I was watching my cousins play it, I thought it was completely stupid. I thought it was really nerdy at first but when I bought it it's really fun. I recommend it to all ages.
B00139XSBA|3.0|The subject matter holds your interest and the author definitely researched the subject well. Unfortunately the author's literary voice is too strong and condescending. As you read the book, his disdain for the middle class and their income plus his feeling of superiority of people either born to wealth or of people who attended ivy league schools wears on the reader.
B00CWV8X04|5.0|I really liked this movie. Great cast, very intriguing story. You may ask, why are they showing that, or what does this have to do with anything, and then they tie it all together at the end. Perfect.
B00B7ERH04|5.0|I really love this app because all the other camera apps either cost money or it just isn't a great app. The only thing I had troubles with is that when you first get the the camera is upside down so all  you have to do is go to the 2 button on the top left and press it and it will say press this region if your camera is upside down. Press that button. I hoped this helped!
B001458MI2|5.0|Great album by Christina Aguilera, to date I think its one of the Best that she had done!!! Really showcase her awesome talent!!!!!!
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I first started playing, I was siked. It was so awesome. Then, I finished all the missions and it got a bit boring... Otherwise, it was a great app.
B0085783Q8|5.0|...dunno why this GREAT show couldn't go on forever. Wilson didn't look that bad. Will miss this team soooo much! Good luck out there. pr.R
B00AEUU4LQ|4.0|Unfortunately, I took a break from reading this book while I was in the middle of it, so the already complex story lines were even harder to follow.  Nonetheless, it was a magnificent and poignant novel. I don't re-read many books, but I suspect that this is one that I will.
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|This has been a suspenseful, exciting show that our whole family has enjoyed together. It's along the lines of Revolution (a terribly done show but similar to Falling Sky in story line) or Jericho but add alien invasion to the mix. The plot is interesting and the character development is good too... Looking forward to season three!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This movie has it all.  I was so impressed with this movie, that my wife and I are going to see Red 2 at the theater tonight. I thought it would be good but it was even better.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I agree with all the reviews. I love all the people who like this app. Thank you all. Thanks again i love you
0765325950|5.0|Need to get this book, it is a dramatic ending to the book but such a let down as there will not be any future books in this series.
B00000GAIW|5.0|Possibly one of the best Progressive Rock albums ever produced, if you're new to Jethro Tull (as was I several months ago), this is the album for you to listen.<br /><br />Alongside Close to the Edge, this is the best album of the genre I've ever had the pleasure of listening.
0062014102|5.0|this book is an incredibly important bridge between the insights of the ancient wisdom of the enlightened teachers in the yogic tradition and western scientific view. it opens up the minds eye, which heretofore was encouraged to accept in faith the spiritual laws of the divine. no doubt ,michael was the intended conduit for these insights.. thank you , with my sincere gratitude. only wish you were still here on this plane.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I like it but I wish u didn't have to pay 2 tokens per. game and if u run out of tokens u have to pay with ur own money or wait 45 min. to do a scratch thing so that's my only problem with the game but other than that its a pretty good game!:)
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|It's been a while since Neil Gaiman offered a full novel. This is one that gives us another view of the world. Skipping through time from the present to the half remembered past our hero remembers just enough to allow  offers his us to fill the gaps introduces us to a creature so evil that is innocent and to the guardians who would protect us all. Classic Gaiman.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|My kids, 4 and 7 really enjoyed this movie and I liked watching it with them. Visually stunning. Enjoyable actors. Mila Kunis was a scary witch. The romance was unnecessary but a small enough portion of the movie.
B003P2WO5E|3.0|Only half way thru. Intriguing and trying to figure where he is going with it. will update further when I get deeper in the book
B0017WCG48|4.0|I know many, many reviewers were saying bad things about this vinyl re-issue. However, I think that must be for the 33 RPM version. My 2 LP 180 gram 45 RPM set sounds pretty good. Some songs do sound a bit 'muffled' in the highs and mids, however it sounds pretty darn heavy overall. My great condition Elektra first-press is much brighter sounding than this re-issue, but the mids and highs are more 'in your face'. Cliff's bass probably sounds best on this 45 RPM re-issue. Overall, I'm sort of satisfied with this version. I won't be returning it, but it isn't as good as it could be. Whoever mastered this pressing sort of dropped the ball.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|The Fast Diet makes &#34;fasting&#34; two days a week sound like an insurmountable mountain.  It's two days a week of eating 500 to 600 calories a day.  That's about what one very good meal a day usually is.  Try it...you'll like it!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Could not put it down... GREAT READ!!!! A refreshing and new story line... Wish there were more that one book.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|have this game on my iphone it works really well decided to get if for my kindle and it has not worked well at all. when I purchase items and place things and then exit the game when I return they are no longer there so I repurchase and again when I return its gone this happens 3 times every time per item it is becoming very frustrating
B004G600A4|5.0|This is a great family movie. I catch myself sitting on the couch with my girls when I pop it in the DVD player.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|If you love NPH and want a hardcopy of this gem, buy the DVD. My boyfriend introduced me to Dr. Horrible and I'm glad that we have it on the DVD shelf. A great Christmas present for any NPH geek :) Cheers.
B008MM9630|5.0|This game is great. I think everyone should try this game. It take some time to warm up to and some patience with the plants but its totally worth it.
030758836X|4.0|Ever since third grade when I discovered the magic of well written mystery stories (thank you, Nancy Drew), whenever there is buzz about a new author or novel, I'm there. With Gone Girl, they had me at Gone. I wanted to love it, and some parts of it, I did. But much of it disappointed me. I think I was expecting more than it delivered, especially (spoiler alert!) when the truth unravels. It was slightly bizarre, to say the least. I think Gillian Flynn had great material with which to work, but somehow, as a reader, I felt she was led astray somewhere along the way and never returned to her original purpose. Oh, well. . .there was a lot to like, but not much to love, just like the characters.
B001HBYHFA|1.0|This video buffered 28 times.  Made the movie all most unwatchable. Insult to injury...it was free on Netflix. Really?<br /><br />jdh
B007SGLZP8|4.0|a little far fetched,  but it is fiction and I enjoyed the read,<br />lots of twists and turns.<br />probably make a great movie.<br />E.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I love the way Hossini weaves his stories and I love the strength of his characters.  He brings the people of Afhanistan to our hearts.  I cannot get enough of his writings.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is such a great Show! I got hooked and it's finally a show for me! 3 words: Witty, Smart, ENTERTAINING!
B00846REIS|5.0|This book should not be compared to 50 shades... Although I loved that series this book is great in its own way. The storyline is full of twists and turns that will keep you hanging on the whole book through!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Umm I love this book! I would really recommend this book to 13 and up since there are swear words. But most of all this book was absolutely amazing!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I was trying to find a good weather app to keep up with day to day forecasts. well I found the right one!!! this is one of the most detailed weather apps I have come across and will be using for many years to come!! thank you AccuWeather!!!
0307740919|4.0|I chose it for my book-club in Philly because I have transplanted here from New Orleans. I love the way Morrison brings the soul and demons of the south alive.
B007Z8ZKS2|4.0|Having never read a John Green book before, I was pleasantly surprised by his writing style.<br />It's beautifully penned in a language we can relate with today and yet it captures the emotions of the two protagonists. Your heart goes out to them, not because you feel sorry for them but because how extremely tragic and brave their story is.<br />It's a wonderful read an will definitely recommends it
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This thing is impressive. For such a small tool, it did a great job sharpening my pocket knives as well as some of my hunting and fishing knives. Considering this is such a cheap accessory, if you don't have anything to sharpen your knives this is by all means a great option for you. Highly recommended!
B003VANOFY|5.0|This headset is awesome. I've had it for about 3 weeks now and there is only one or two problems I found which I will mention in pros and cons. I upgraded from a Turtle Beach P11 to this which was a great improvement. Anyways now on to pros and cons.<br />Pros:<br />- Adjustable, you can adjust the headset however you want for maximum comfort<br />- Durable, even if you drop it a couple times it wont break or have any signs of damage to it<br />- Comfortable, headset is covered in padding and feels great on ears and head<br />- Sound Quality is amazing, 7.1 Surround Sound sounds crisp and clear<br />- Voice Changer, a cool feature to have and fun to mess with<br />- Wireless, no wires to get tangled in and even reaches all the way to my kitchen so I can talk to people on Skype and make a sandwich :P<br />Cons:<br />- Sometimes while i'm running a game with Pandora on with 7.1 Surround Sound enabled the music gets staticy<br />- You sound muffled while talking with headset on(maybe just preference)<br />Overall a great headset, I would definitely recommend this headset to someone. Rated 5 stars!
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Its nice app compaired to basic calendar. Can set multiple appointments with or without alarms recurring daily, weekly, bi weekly, monthly, or yearly. Easy to use.
B0090SI4OC|3.0|We read the book before watching the movie, which made us slightly disappointed in the movie. Books contain so much more information and when the movie doesn't follow along it makes you think more about what was supposed to happen according to the book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it I like the upgrades but I think they  should put more. people to play put les coins from a 9 year old :)
B001B93QSW|5.0|First album from band and one of there best. Just saw them in Big Flats NY other night and this was the only album I didn`t replace when I went from tapes to cds.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|was really a very good movie....want to buy it and keep it, so I can see it again and again.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Another successful installment of Robert Langdon's life by Dan Brown. The story is interesting, keeps you enthralled and wanting to know more. As always, Langdon is a great character to follow. Hard to put down, just like the others.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Very fun game to kill time with.  Addictive and hard to stop playing.  Easy to drain the entire battery in one sitting.
B00BURWSHA|5.0|The guitaist to sit along side the Master.That being David Coverdale.This project/side band of the great Doug Aldridge is a keeper.Doug was a great choise to take to place of ,I feel,was the best guitaist to play with Whitesnke,John Sykes. Doug has the same feel and sound of Sykes.I enjoyed the albums he did with this band back in the 80s,that have resently been reissued. I remember having them and wearing them out.Buy and enjoy.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Supernatual somehow manages to maintain a balance between creepy and hilarious. I am a fan of later seasons and decided to buy season 1 to get a feel for how the show started. I am a huge fan of the series and can't wait for season 9!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great story and can't wait for the movie.  I'm glad the way it turns out.  You must read the books before you see the movie.

B003AWRMCE|5.0|Clint Eastwood directing and starring in a western, what could be better?  Even the non-western fans recognized that this was super. Gene Hackman did a superb job as the bad sheriff, as did Morgan Freeman as Clint's sidekick.
B005L12SB2|5.0|Now,Ive had about every release these guys have put out over the years at one time or another. Some that are in this set I have never even heard. A great set for a great price. Im in the process of listening to them in my truck now.If that album had a gatefuld sleave,thats what you get here.The carboard sleeved arnt very sturdy,no inserts with credits or words to the songs like in the originals.If youre a Kansas fan,its worth the price to have all these albums in one set.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|I was just getting into paracording when i bought this. Great info and very easy to follow pictures. I have the kindle version but the hard cover would be a nice gift to any paracorders.
0688014291|5.0|Easy to read, structured as a story, The One Minute Manager is the perfect starting point if you've never managed anyone before.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|However...my two daughters really enjoyed My Little Pony Equestria Girls.  The story teaches about the power of friendship as Twilight Sparkle ventures out to a new world and tries to reclaim her crown that was stolen from her in the Crystal Empire.  The humor is good as Twilight Sparkle tries to adjust to becoming a human and fitting into a new school with human like versions of her pony friends.  There's plenty of singing and dancing with catchy pop music and the voice acting is well done. The artwork is similar to the cartoon series which I'm sure my daughters will now want to see more of.  If you have girls, they'll love this movie.

B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I enjoyed this book a great deal.  I found that the background on the German airman to be very interesting.

B006FE83UE|5.0|Nelle Lee Harper published only one book ... and that was quite sufficient! Everything worth talking about is in that one story: love, faithfulness, respect, reliability, honesty, integrity, courage. These things are woven into a canvas of delightful humour and beautifully simple but intelligent language.<br />  The film is remarkably faithful both to the written story and to the characters and values therein. (I have purchased several copies with which I will bless my children, grandchildren and friends.) Gregory Peck and Mary Badham were blessed in their opportunities to play Atticus and Scout ... and we have been blessed in their portrayals.<br />  I watch &#34;Mockingbird&#34; again and again.

B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters and purchased this here on Amazon, and want to say that I enjoyed every minute of it. It felt like I was inside of the game itself. The movie itself does teach good lessons and break stereotypes. For those who love video games, this movie is for you. The way I analyze this, Wreck-It Ralph is related to one Disney character that I love who is in the same boat as Ralph himself. He is known as Pete the Cat. We all know he plays the bad guy in TV shows such as House Of Mouse and Mickey Mouse Works, video games, and movies, but just because he plays the \\"bad guy\\" doesn't mean he's a bad guy. Pete does have friends and Mickey Mouse already knows that. Goof Troop and Mickey Mouse Clubhouse are perfect examples of that. If there was a Disney version of the Bad-Anon, Pete would be included in that, as well as Mortimer Mouse, Pete's cousin Zeke, and the Beagle Boys from Mickey, Donald, and Goofy: The Three Musketeers. I can just imagine what would happen if Pete didn't exist in the movies, TV shows, and video games with Mickey and his friends. Mickey and his friends would go out of business, they would facing early retirement. So I can say that Pete has had a bigger impact on Mickey Mouse's life than anyone can imagine.

B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|The main characters in this period piece had great chemistry on screen.  I would recommend this film to anyone interested in period films depicting this time in history.  In our present time, it's tough to imagine a society where property was handed down via a male blood line, and class connections had such a prominent place in identifying a person's ultimate station in life.  This film managed to do both, and yet pushed the boundaries.

If you've bought it, save a few hours of your life that you'll want back if you read it.<br /><br />The good guys are desperately trying to stay ahead of the bad guys who are right on their trail, but...there's always time to stop and give another long history lesson that Langdon won't believe anyway.  Of course, it's hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys, since Brown uses the totally annoying device of having everyone act like buttheads and force others to comply instead of just asking for their help.<br /><br />But in the end, if you make it that far, you'll hate that too.  Really?  The missing word is The Bible?  Gag.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game re boots the Barry steakfries character from the age of zombies game. The games both have had graphics upgrades recently, and both are amazing! In this game, guide Barry through the laboratory by tapping the screen to steer him over and under the many obstacles that keep him from beating his last records! Use the various vehicle upgrades, such as the lil stomper bot, or the badass hog motorcycle! This game may use real money to purchase in game objects. Use things like gamecenter to beat friends records, or unlock achievements as you progress through the game's endless goal; get to the end of the laboratory... if one exists...
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Love it, it is a very good game. It is a fun game.  I was very interested in the animals and what they eat.  I was trying to capture a dinosaur, very difficult, takes a lot of money to capture the dinosaur.
1416595554|2.0|Somehow I missed this book when it was published, but I was excited when I heard about it.  A big historical novel about Communist-era Russia seemed like it would be exciting, and I liked the concept of a three part story set at the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution, then during the Stalinist terror of the late 1930s, and finally looking back after the fall of communism.<br /><br />Montefiore clearly knows his history, and his concept of Sashenka is well chosen. She is the daughter of a Jewish arms mogul who has been made a baron for his service to the czarist regime.  His wife is a frivolous sensualist who spends her nights with the dissipated society elites. Sashenka, though, is a fervent Bolshevik, recruited by her uncle Mendel.  She is delighted at the Bolsheviks' success, despite the heavy cost to her family.<br /><br />Skip forward 20 years, and Sashenka is married to a comrade who is an important cog in Stalin's security apparatus, and she has two children she dotes on.  She is the editor of a proletarian women's magazine, but she enjoys the material comforts brought by the longtime party service she and her husband have given. Her comfortable world falls apart when she begins a torrid affair with a writer and the Stalinist terror reaches her family.<br /><br />Finally, in 1994, a researcher learns the outcome of Sashenka's tale, and the terrible choices she had to make when the terror came.<br /><br />Sounds like it should be a terrific story, right?  Wrong.  The biggest problem is the Sashenka character.  What an empty-headed brat.  She begins as a spoiled child who falls in love with the idea of herself as a revolutionary so much that she can't be bothered to concern herself with the fates visited on her parents and her supposedly beloved governess, Lala.<br /><br />In Part Two, with Sashenka as a grown woman, she is a doctrinaire party hack, who has her blinders permanently fixed on her head, refusing to see that all those former friends and colleagues who were arrested, tortured and exiled or executed weren't likely to be traitors.  She doesn't even try to find out anything about the fates of people she loved dearly and who loved her. When she learns about horrific abuses in the system, she refuses to believe it.<br /><br />Suddenly, out of nowhere, she falls into a passionate affair with a writer named Golden.  It's supposed to be a love affair, but as far as I could tell from the way Montefiore presents it, it was just a midlife crisis sexual frenzy, and a tawdry one at that.<br /><br />When the threat to Sashenka's privileged life hits home, all of a sudden she cares about the abuses of the Stalinists. I'm sure this is realistic, but it doesn't make for a sympathetic character, which Montefiore seems to have been aiming for.  All I could think was that it wasn't much more than she deserved.<br /><br />When we finally got to the big reveal about what actually happened to Sashenka and her family, I didn't care much anymore.  It had little emotional resonance, because Sashenka had reaped the wind and sowed the whirlwind.  However, I will say that Part Three took this read from a 1-star or 1.5 start to a 2.5 for me, because of its focus on tracing what happened to the characters through the old archives of the Communist Party, and the few witnesses left alive in 1994.  I'm fascinated by these stories told through the records of the Bolsheviks, East Germany's Stasi and the Nazis.<br /><br />Montefiore's prose is stolid, and his descriptions of Sashenka's sexual liaisons overly and un-erotically detailed. He also goes on for many more pages than necessary detailing Soviet torture and interrogations.<br /><br />A note about the audiobook: Anne Flosnik is a dreadful narrator of this story. She gives Sashenka the voice of a very young girl, even when she is 40 years old.  Her male characters all sound the same, with a cartoonish, yet uncategorizable accent.  Her pronunciation of Russian words and names is laughable.Avoid the audiobook.  After listening to the first two parts of the book, I went to the library and got the hardcover to read Part Three, rather than listen to this terrible narration.Avoid the audiobook.

B002OSY2T6|1.0|This toy is possessed-- or so it would seem.  See it seems that any time I walk near it, it decides to exclaim in joy and light up maniacally.  Either the toy has an extra sensitive motion sensor or it is being controlled by demons.  You be the judge.  It scared the diaper off my baby.  Annoyed the pants off of everyone else.  We needed to perform an exorcism on it to make it stop giggling and talking.  Now it is buried in a hermetically sealed titanium box 30 feet below the earth so it will never torment this family again.
0525951652|5.0|To follow the history of that period and see how the egos of men changed the lives of people in those days and those who follow after is to know that our thoughts and our actions truly change the world - one person at a time.  To understand the impact that we each have on the world can be empowering and devastating.

B004Y1USV2|5.0|Fly From Here is a great album with great songs. The instrumental opening track is perhaps my favorite passage from the disc, with keyboard line playing in 5, and the drums in 4. Very clever as usual. The disc contains excellent solos by Steve Howe. My biggest criticism however, is the fact that some songs, like the title track actually be a remake of outtakes of the Buggles, which gave an 80's taste in virtually the entire disc, thanks to compositions and keyboard player Geoff Downes. I also felt the drums with a different tone than we're used to hear from Alan White, who for me is one of the greatest drummers in rock history. But as I said, the talent of these guys is so huge that it is difficult to hear anything bad from them, but I get the feeling that if they had focused on writing new songs, instead of taking leftovers from the past, this album could have been much better.
B000HZHBIM|5.0|If you're familiar with the television show, Star Trek, you know that it is not filled with non-stop fighting, action. It's more like a way of life and being confronted by or encountering unknown species. This movie was slow to moderately paced but kept my attention! I enjoyed the storyline, the acting, and the dialogue. After I watched it, I was compelled to order the entire motion picture movie series. I watched the second movie, The Wrath of Khan, and had watched the sixth movie, The Undiscovered Country, prior to buying the movie set. I enjoyed both of these movies too. Buy the motion movie set; you'll enjoy it.

I lived and breathed Zelda when I was a kid and play the games religiously to this day and this book sums a lot of things up that you otherwise would not know no matter how many times you play the games. The artwork and sketch designs are amazing and it gives an entirely new perspective on the Zelda franchise. Anybody who is a big of Zelda fan as me, I definitely recommend buying this book.
B008JFUR10|1.0|In brief: Every bit as retarded as the trailers made it seem.<br /><br />I didn't have a burning desire to see this film, though I will admit that I harbored some curiosity about it, given the impressive-looking spectacle of special effects indicated in the trailers, and a statement by one person on the Web who said it was \\"awesome\\". The fact that Guillermo del Toro directed it was certainly a plus, though ultimately, it boiled down to the fact that by the time my friend and I got together on the night in question, it was the most appealing choice with a time showing left at the theater, as we were too late to see anything else.<br /><br />As it turns out, the film's entire content, much as I inferred from the trailers, can be boiled down to five words:<br /><br />  \\"Giant Robots Versus Giant Monsters.\\"<br /><br />That's it.<br /><br />When I say the \\"the film's entire content\\", mind you, I'm not being capricious with my words. That's all the film is about. What I mean by this is that while good stories may attract viewers with a flashy surface, they usually contain some substance or heart beneath it. \\"Spider-Man\\", for example, is not about a guy who gains spider-powers and swings around New York. It's about a young man who learns what responsibility is. \\"Star Wars\\" isn't about lightsabers. It's a modern take on the classic hero's journey, it's about confronting our own dark nature, with some classic Greek drama thrown in. \\"Aliens\\" isn't about blowing aliens way, it's a parable mirroring the Vietnam War, with added themes of motherhood. \\"The Big Lebowski\\" is about the emasculation of men. With \\"Pacific Rim\\", however, there is no \\"about\\". Everything about the film that isn't giant robots pummeling giant monsters is just filler meant to justify that high-concept, one-line, gimmicky premise, one that could've been written on a napkin by del Toro while watching one of his kids smash two of his favorite toys together, which pretty much embodies the film's sensibility--assuming one can use the word \\"sensibility\\" when discussing this mindless excuse for a story. Mind you, being inspired by a gimmick, in and of itself, doesn't necessarily doom a story. The idea of taking several of Marvel Comics' premiere superheroes that star in their own solo stories, and having them cross over by coming together as a team, for example, is essentially a high-concept gimmick. But that doesn't mean a good storyteller can't tell a story with that premise with interesting characters who affect one another, whose actions affect the public, whose responses to the story's major threat aren't influenced by--and in turn influence--their personalities, and who can touch the audience on an emotional level. Some of the genre's most beloved franchises started out as stories that could essentially be described as high-concepts or gimmicks. But that's because in way or another, those franchises harbored ideas or qualities that managed to transcend their shorthand, capsulized descriptions.<br /><br />\\"Pacific Rim\\", however, harbors no such ideas at its non-existent heart. It does not feature characters of any meaningful depth or originality. Much as \\"Man of Steel\\" contrasts with the Richard Donner Superman films, we do not really get a sense that the characters really care about the people they're ostensibly protecting, let alone that the Jaegers prevent more property damage and loss of life than they cause. We get no sense of what motivates the characters, how their interactions change them on a fundamental level, or how they affect the public. The film simply takes a premise that's idiotic on its face, and pads it with scenes that are A. Cliched B. Uninteresting and therefore make the non-fighting scenes drag, and C. Make no sense.<br /><br />Let's start with the idiotic premise.<br /><br />When these giant kaiju first start coming out of the interdimensional portal at the bottom of the ocean known as the Breach, governments naturally throw fighter jets at them,which is what they *should* be doing. While it takes a considerable pounding before the jets manage to kill it----tens of thousands of lives are said to be lost in the process----the fact is, they do get the job done. But, the narrator tells us, humans needed a better weapon to fight them, and this is where the giant robots, called Jaegers (from the German word for \\"hunter\\"), come in. It's also where the creators inform us that any semblance of intelligence is about to go right out the window, as the entire premise of the giant robots is apparently predicated on the following, ridiculous-yet-unspoken notion:<br /><br />  Punching giant monsters is a better way to kill them than with bombs.<br /><br />Think about that for a second. The humans can simply drop nukes on these monsters before they even reach the shore, or they can simply use the most powerful non-nuclear bombs in their arsenal (thermobaric bombs), which should incinerate the suckers. We already have bombers in our arsenal, which are pretty efficient, and since most of the kaiju are limited to the water or the ground (we only see one in the film's second act that can fly), the pilots are fairly safe. Hell, we're already using unmanned drone bombers today, so by the future time frame of this movie, pilots could essentially be moot, so their safety wouldn't be an issue.<br /><br />But no.<br /><br />Instead, they decide that robots the size of skyscrapers, which must take years to merely to design, let alone build (Idris Elba's character, Stacker, informs us that the first one was rushed out in 14 months) which punch the monsters in the face, and which require pilots with great martial arts skills, are a \\"better weapon\\" than such bombs, though its is never explained to us WHY. When you go bear hunting, you take a gun with you. You don't bone up on your kung fu. But we're just supposed to accept this, without question, simply in order to justify the shots of the giant robots doing judo flips with giant monsters. When we do see fighter jets taking on one of the monsters in a flashback sequence showing Mako as a little girl, they use their machine guns only. But when we see the Jaeger appear on the scene, the Jaeger punches the monster, and then opens up a chamber on its chest with six cannons that kill the beast with bombs. Again, I ask, why couldn't the fighter jets just fire those bombs themselves? Why does that initial \\"punch\\" by the robot help?<br /><br />For that matter, why do Jaeger pilots need to connect their minds to the Jaeger, let alone each other? The Jaeger's movements are pretty much simple: Walk. Punch. And that's it. How complex are their movements that a simple virtual reality set up like what we have with modern-day video games and flight simulators isn't sufficient?<br /><br />This wouldn't have been so bad if there were something under the Michael Bay-ish surface of this movie, but there isn't. What we do have are boilerplate genre clichés so beaten into the ground that they're dating Chris Brown. Let's see:<br /><br />  *Ace hotshot traumatized by past tragedy must learn to put aside their fears to perform whatever extreme physical activity in which they excel in order to save the day: Check (Twice, actually, since both this applies to both Raleigh and Mako.)<br />  *A rival starts trouble with the main character hotshot, because he thinks he's dangerous/a loose cannon/whatever, but comes to eventually respect the hotshot: Check. This is such a shamelessly overused trope that the writers of both Top Gun and Team America should've gotten a royalty for this.<br />  *A black supporting character in a science fiction film ends up sacrificing himself. Check.<br /><br />Aside from the brief martial arts fight between two humans, none of these scenes are engaging, and therefore, they have the effect of bringing the story to a screeching halt. Even on their own terms, much of it makes no sense. When we learn, for example, that the Jaeger program is beingterminated within eight months, in favor of a coastal wall program, Del Toro and co-screenwriter Travis Beacham actually had the opportunity to make the stakes seem important, and give a sense of urgency to the proceedings. But instead, they establish rather early on that the coastal walls provide about as much protection from the kaiju as popsicle sticks. Putting aside the question of why the Powers That Be thought those walls would work (perhaps this is part of the kaiju's \\"adaptability\\"?), doesn't doing this remove the threat of the Jaeger program's shutdown? And why is the status of the Jaeger program never clarified or updated after the coastal walls are revealed to be ineffective? And do del Toro and Beacham even KNOW what an electromagnetic pulse is? By what retarded rationale are electronic devices unaffected by EMPs simply because they're \\"digital, not analog\\"??<br /><br />The robot-monster fight scenes ARE impressive. The film should get Oscar nominations for visual effects and art direction for the monster designs alone. But these elements are impressive in the same way that fan films like \\"Ryan v. Dorkman\\" are impressive: Something that's interesting to watch for several minutes, but not something in which I'd want to invest over 2 hours of my time and ten dollars. As storytelling goes, \\"Pacific Rim\\" is just empty calories, like an entire meal of whipped cream. It falls into the same pantheon of films as \\"The Core\\", \\"Transformers\\" and the films of Roland Emmerich, a standard to which it is disappointing to see Guillermo del Toro aspiring.

I anxiously await the next movie!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This is obviously the best slenderman game yet for kindles.  It is really hard on hard (hmmm.... wonder why its called hard...)  it is fun and challenging. So i would highly recommend this game.  It is worth the 99 cents.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I understand how some readers can't get over the peppered in &#34;Britishisms&#34; and yea, it initially was annoying to me..  But the book was entertaining and since I'm not a literary critic (like most of the Amazon readers, despite their fastidious reviews), then I have no issue overlooking a few flaws. The book entertained me in spite of those flaws so I really don't care that the author refers to Ana's &#34;down there&#34; area or clearly has a strong (British) opinion about her tea Sometimes the female character is such a whiny girly girl but that's just the normal element of Damsel in Distress that most of us have bought into forever even if we don't want to admit it. Grey definitely has moments of being a pompous a__ but there are more redeeming moments that are pretty hot...and would never happen in real life,especially when his significant other is a whiny girly girl like Ana BUT that is why it's FICTION. Thanks for spicing up my summer EL James. I'd read again.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The first 3 books were amazing, I couldn't put them down! Can't wait for the other 2, HURRY UP SYLVIA!!! ;)
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|This movie was much better than i had anticipated,  i thought it would be more of a blame game movie but it had twists all over.
B005LAIIFS|5.0|The overall movie was excellent; as the story, characters, and animation really come together in this one. Daughter thought this video was fantastic, and I have to admit, I even enjoyed it myself. I highly recommend. Only issue: one of my walking eggs was broken, but no big deal
B008BU75IQ|4.0|I had read the two previous books in the series and they ended with you needing to buy the next book.  Well, the last one, &#34;Best Kept Secret&#34;  ended that way as well.
B008OOYALE|5.0|TeamLava can you send me something on my wall to tell me more about getting the battle arena.<br />My friend says that you need a game? True or False TeamLava.<br />I really want to BATTLE!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />By Maddy
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|This author has the ability to make the reader go on the journey with the characters. I thoroughly enjoyed the Kite Runner and this new release didn't disappoint. It was one that I didn't want to put down. The story wove the threads of different characters lives together to draw me into journey. A great read!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|the game is so fun and when I start there's so stooping me and an my I pod I have every thing but I haven't played it on my kindle. awesome game
B0045EPCQ4|5.0|I love this product because I can &#34;read&#34; while I drive to my work. I am Brazilian and I can practice my English.
1442419814|5.0|The book, Uglies by Scott Westerfeld, was outstanding! I couldn't put it down. I read it daily so that I could finish and get to the next in the series! The plot was always changing and the characters were constantly becoming something totally different than how you thought of them originally. The imaginary world in this book was so descriptively explained, I felt like it was real. The character's feelings you could definitely relate to even though their world was nothing like ours. Tally Youngblood, the main character and my favorite was always adding a new trait to her character. She evolves so much in this book. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves fantasy too!
0812982622|3.0|Can't say this was an entertaining read.  I bought it for the Pul;itzer win and my previous read of the fine and informative nonfiction Nothing to Envy.  Not a read that will keep you up late to find the outcome, but well written and a unique piece of fiction.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This game is easy to use.  A quick look at the board lets you analyze your strategy before you play.  Great for planning moves and how you want to proceed.  If you find yourself in a corner with no possible moves, then you can shuffle the tiles to proceed.  Lots of fun to play.
1609611543|5.0|I have always said that if there was only one food that I could eat, it would be bread.  The realities presented in Wheat Belly have awakened my understanding of the realities of processed wheat.  My family and I are working our way through the recipes, delighting in the marvelously surprising flavors and creativity.  We are food lovers and welcome change HOWEVER, it has not lessened our passion for bread.  Instead, we are being discriminating about the flours we use.<br /><br />Wheat Belly should be required reading for parents and medical professionals, especially Pediatricians for their patients and parents.  As a school counselor I have seen too many over weight young children.  By observing their eating behaviors, wheat products are premier (along with lots of sugar ladened foods).<br /><br />This is a life changing book and not faddish; rather, some very sad realities exposed.  The alternatives are easy to prepare and delicious to enjoy.  This is an outstanding book!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|An entertaining little game, good for kids. I only hate how difficult it is to get gems, but how prominent they are to purchase items.
B006MPKD54|5.0|Throughly enjoyed The Black Ice as usual Harry Bosch is a wonderful character and holds your attention, can recomend this book to anyone who enjoys agood detective story
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this series.  There s/b a rating of 10 for exceptional entertainment such as this one. Don't miss it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a awesome app I love it. It is really fun to play. with my firends. and I love 3D
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Great movie!  So much better in blue ray.  Reasonable price for both blue ray and dvd.  Glad I own it to watch and re-watch
B00D37UQ1K|4.0|I was a fan of the book, and was worried about the movie.  The reviews killed the thing in the theaters.  However, I decided to try it online anyway.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  I thought it was very true to the spirit of the book.  It is a sweet, romantic film about not judging.  Be open to the potential of greatness in others.  You may be equally surprised.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Terrific stuff. Story so well told. Acting superb. Range of emotions truly inspired. I can't wait for season 4. Thank you formaking itavailable to see again.
B000SEHJGQ|4.0|Love any story told from a boys point of view.  Made me laugh and cry.  Didn't want it to end.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It is a classic game. How can you not love it. That is all I have to say. O k
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoy the game. Would be awesome if the music changed and possible other personalization. Overall fun game, keep up the good work.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|My wife loved this.  She watched the entire season without a break.  She is now watching the second season.  She rates it with five stars.
B00CM9JKXU|5.0|The new Queensryche cd is excellent.  I gave up on the band after &#34;Q2K&#34;. The last Queensryche cd that I liked was &#34;Empire&#34;.<br />This new cd is the cd that should have been released after &#34;Empire&#34;.  The songs are great.  The band plays great.  Todd La Torre makes Queensryche sound like Queensryche.  I saw them in concert and he sings all of the material very well.<br /><br />If you were disappointed in the direction that Geoff Tate took Queensryche after &#34;Empire&#34; I suggest that you purchase the &#34;Queensryche&#34; cd, because with Todd La Torre Queensryche has fixed their problem.
B00CM7FLZ8|4.0|Great but mostly impossible I beat a few chapters but I'm stuck on1 impossible level .<br />Good game. Worth buying.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|Great acting, good looking cast and good character development, the plot in this season is a little predictable. I would recommend season 1.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|At this point I can only say this looks like this one will be a good ride. I have only seen the first EP, but I liked it well enough to buy the whole 1st season.. There are a lot of plot strings going on here.. Susan and her life and child, and assuming Beth's with all her drama. Then you have the clone thing, and the question of how many Susans, and Beths there are out there.. I'm willing to take the ride, because it does keep your attention. But I'm going to question now how this plot keeps going on after season one..
B008JEJNA2|5.0|I had a different pair of crocs that I had purchased locally but I when looking for more vibrant color options than local merchants carried(black, navy brown & camo) I did read the reviews first and many stated to buy a size smaller than usual. I followed the advice and they were right.I ought the 7 and its still a bit roomy but okay. My husband normally wears a 9 or 91/2 but he bought the 8 and it fits perfect.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever no such thing as a better game but nobody can get on my worlds worth the price
0761169253|5.0|This book has so many practical suggestions that it should be required reading for anyone over the age of 18!  I read it in one sitting and appreciate the author's insights and sense of humor.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Like The Kite Runner, I didn't want it to end. Khaled Hosseini draws you in and takes your heart into the narrative.
B00CL6HGIK|4.0|How can you go wrong with Crowe and Wahlberg?? This movie really  made you think about politics and corruption in general
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|Best game ever since minecraft pocket edition ,cut the rope,and angry birds wait no not angry birds hambo yeah<br /><br />Y
B00005JM02|5.0|My grandchildren loved this DVD!  Yes, they'd seen it before but that didn't make it any less wonderful and I'm sure they'll sit with me and watch it again, and again
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|While sympathetic to the ordeal of Jaycee's imprisonment, somehow this memoir left more questions unanswered than answered. I hope she is able to complete her memoir in the future.
161655164X|4.0|The book itself is great, but i have some problems with it's front look, because of a shipping and handling.<br /><br />Nevertheless, i like it so much, there are a lot of concepts and arts, which you would like to check. Also, there is a comic arts section, which you can check and decide - purchase or not the comics about Ellie.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon for this book.
B005CRQ3RK|4.0|Very good ! Greg is awesome . I personally think that this is a<br />A good book !!!! How long did the last straw take? When is the<br />Next book out 1213 or 1214? Personally like when Greg is in basket and jump out and scared his dad!!! Greg is a great job with his family and big deal!!
B002XGRSBI|5.0|As usual Paul turns out GREAT song after GREAT song, much to my pleasure,  I am a Religous follwer and admirer of both him and his surviving partner, Ringo, so I may be slightly biased.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The last installment to this series does not disappoint. Twists and surprises still line every chapter. A great finale to a great series.
B000CNFC76|5.0|My wife and i bought this a little while back.  Great family movie.  Clean. Good plot.  Fun story.  You have to love a great Cinderella story!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I opened Facebook yesterday and saw that I needed to do an update. So I clicked the link and it took me to google play where it indicated that it didn't recognize my device. I did what it told me to and it didn't work. I then opened Facebook with the intention to follow the upgrade link again but Facebook opened for a second and the closed. It now won't load at all. I deleted the app and then re installed but still won't work!<br /><br />The app worked awesome before so I'm bummed it won't work. Any tips are welcome!!!!
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|Most horror movies that are being released these days have a pretty significant &#34;cheese&#34; factor... this one, not so much...
B0060AY85C|2.0|I was initially engaged by the story of Frank and Cee Money, and the mystery of one of their adventures. As their stories unfold, too many issues are introduced, and 'home' -literally, figuratively and historically - becomes quickly filled with these important issues diluted by Morrison's pen.  I am a fan of Toni Morrison and was surprised that I was disappointed.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I felt this was a gripping story of a deeply disturbed young man, who had been repeatedly verbally and physically bullied by the victim and his peers. The &#34;murder gene&#34; factor that was discussed concerning Jacob's grandfather was compelling. His own father's narration of the events concerning the case and it's many twists & turns was vivid. The mother was just the wreck that any mother would be under the circumstances. The ending was a tragic surprise. I couldn't put it down!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|My grandchildren really enjoy this app. I have even paid for the extras and not waited for them to earn the points because they do enjoy it so much
B00BAYLRNO|1.0|I am not able up play blue ray on my TV but downloaded the movie to Flixter on my iPad thinking we could play the movie on our TV in connecting the iPad to the TV NO GO. WE HAVE YO WATCH IG ON THE IPAD. Pity D we have a 60\\"TV & it is a great movie. Rented it from Red Box eventually
B0055B7K7A|5.0|I love this movie for the simple way it portrays human emotions and relationships. It's beautifully done. No sense spoiling it for anyone. If you haven't seen do so. This movie is for everyone from the very young to the very old and everyone in between!
B005TBN3EU|3.0|Not so funny as the first one. It felt like the topic was underexploited this time. Hope the third one is better.
B008K8VDPU|3.0|a working piano with song options, good to get your fingers started but if you already play watching the bouncing lights will drive you crazy
B0067RQYNW|5.0|I will be upgrading.  Love it.  It does what I need it to do.  Better than most other office solutions for kindle
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I cannot put into words how much this book moved me. I have never read a book like this, and I have read many. This book cannot be described in one word. I was put to tears in this book. The best book I have ever read.
B000GWE44U|4.0|The styles in this movie may be dated, but it's as scary and as entertaining as ever. I think of it almost every time I check into a hotel.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|a very slow moving game without much change in the scenery takes a lot of patience there are better choices<br />of race games, this one is better for a kid starting out
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I am very impressed with this game.  I enjoy playing this and I think people who don't even play games will like this.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Loved this movie! In the first 15 minutes the action started and continued all the way through. This movie was intense yet it had humor. Very exciting. Would recommend to every one to see.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|Very fun time passer. Perhaps to fun the challenge is a bit to addicting! Looking forward to more floors. The clues get harder and more fun to find as the game progresses
B005544V6A|5.0|I am loving this show. I think it's great. I recommend this show to whoever likes shows like White Collar or any legal show.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Fabulous.  I loved every minute and was sorry to see it end.<br />Can't wait to see Season 3 very soon.
B007SGM084|5.0|LOVED LOVED LOVED this series - I read these books over and over and over and over....Loved the simplicity in which James writes...The characters are fantastic - story totally UNFORGETABLE!!  The end of the first book left me hysterical - in total panic mode - and instantly, I reached for the second - which gets better and better - then FREED!  so sad to see it end but written so enjoyably that I will continue to read my highlighted notes on my kindle over and over for years to come - Thanks E.L. James!  You are truly amazing!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Got the full version. Great game and graphics but as with all the games I have played in this genre, way too short!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Like the other &#34;A Song of Ice and Fire&#34; books, &#34;A Feast for Crows&#34; is a literary narcotic.  I have never read anything like this.  Martin surpasses Tolkien in writing a tale that pulls you in and refuses to release you. I am utterly addicted. Like a junkie who desires his drug despite the damage it will do to his life, I find myself staying up late just to get another chapter in, even though I have to catch an early flight the next day.  The characters are fleshed out in amazing detail, and each given personalities so distinct that you feel like you know them personally. There are so many, but I like to mention two of my favorites. Ser Jaime's redemption makes you want to cheer for a man who in the first book, pushed a boy out of a tower, even though he threatened to toss a newborn in a trebuchet in this book.  There is no female character, at least in my literary experience like Aya Greyjoy. An amazing female character who is a hardened warrior, a ship's captain, and yet a sex kitten. I cannot wait to see how Martin winds up this epic, I am fiending for it.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Preface this with the fact that I am an unabashed Neil Gaiman fan.  I started reading this on a Friday night, and finished it the following evening.  Had I the day free I would have finished it in one sitting.<br /><br />The best make the impossible appear effortless, and this is Gaiman at his best. He spins together a world where dream logic and reality blend seamlessly.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I titled my review this way because of the following:  When my high school years were coming to an end and I was preparing for college, I was slightly apprehensive.  I was a good student and loved to learn...but I really didn't like to READ...I knew to make it through college, and graduate with great grades, I needed to learn to LOVE to read.<br /><br />The summer before college started, my mother gave me the beautiful hard cover book, \\"Lucky\\" by Jackie Collins. Like I said, I didn't like to read and the thoughts of WANTING to read a book that looked to be 3 inches thick was just crazy!  But for her, I did it anyway.  I read this book several times from cover to cover - I couldn't believe someone could write like this!  It was this VERY book that got me excited about reading and I never stopped...<br /><br />I mentioned this so I could tell you about the amazing book, \\"Hopeless\\" by Colleen Hoover.  You see, I now have a teenager of my own...she too is smart, works hard in school and gets great grades, but she doesn't like to read.  So, following my mother's lead, I gave her \\"Hopeless\\" at the beginning of the Spring time and begged her to read it and for me, she did.<br /><br />As \\"Lucky\\" was the book to begin my reading craze 25 years ago, \\"Hopeless\\" is THAT book that did it for my teenager!  THANK YOU!! Colleen Hoover...I have since passed this onto my extended family and book club friends and it is definitely one of ALL our favorites!<br /><br />My teenager read the book on my kindle but as soon as the paper back version was released, I ordered it for her and had it shipped from Amazon- she carries it around EVERYWHERE!<br /><br />Cheers to you, Colleen Hoover, for getting teens to read with your beautiful deep characters, lovely words and amazing story!  THIS IS A MUST MUST read for every age!  We are forever fans!  Thanks again.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|If you haven't done so yet, watch this movie. If you have a teenager or two in your life watch this with them. This movie will show what a true man is supposed to be and I think it should be shown at every middle and high school in the country.<br /><br />This movie demonstrates what family and love should look like. How much better our country can be if we get back to the values of the family. There are too many kids being raised without the benefit of both father and mother.<br /><br />Watch it and share it and live it.
B001HPP2XW|5.0|I Never got a round to seeing this movie but always heard good things about it. Finally I got around to ordering my own copy. Totally an amazing movie. Turned out way better then i had expected. Adury was just great in this movie!!!!
B0095MVOMC|5.0|This keeps me interested for long periods. That's a big plus. I really enjoy hunting for things. It's fun to see how you expand your mind.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is awesome. very best free download. can't stop playing. kids love it and love watching me play it. need more free games likes this one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games. Did not see the movie.  Loved the book.  For all ages. Will read the rest of the series.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I really love this great movie.  This has to be Sandra Bullock's best role.  I was really glad to save some money and add it to my collection.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved this series.  It makes you want to watch the next episode right away.  I was extremley loving this show until the last minute of the series.  It made me SO angry with how it ended.
B009GIPDQS|5.0|The Racketeer is vintage Gisham novel which keeps you hanging on to the narrative up to the end with twists & turns to keep you intrigued throughout the journey.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book is so amazing! I liked it so much, I read them twice! These books are amazing, and I liked them so much!

B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|Love itGreat purchase. Would buy more dolls. My daughter loved it.  She is a monster High addict. Wish the dolls were easier to find.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|I've read several of Dan Brown's books and they're all good.  It could do without the romance . . . leave that to those romance novels, but overall I enjoyed the book.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I can not wait to read the next  one!<br /><br />Enjoyed the continued story line and the twists to the plot.
B000002KHH|2.0|The sound quality is good but, the loudness of this recording leaves you disappointed! All other CD's that i own are MUCH loader at the same volume setting.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a entertaining and additive game.  Got this for me and my kids, we all love it<br />It's a little too hard for my four year old but my six year old loves it
B00CDUVDEC|5.0|After the Great Southern Trendkill, Anselmo seemed to compartmentalize his talents with Pantera, Down, and Superjoint Ritual among others. Pantera became the big mainstream metal band with catchy hooks and big verses (Electric, Revolution is my Name etc). Down remained the &#34;artistic&#34; endeavor exploring the solipsistic journey into the mysticism and solitude that is southern Louisiana. Superjoint Ritual offered a glimpse of the more hardcore elements touched on in TGSTK. Walk Through Exits Only is the logical next step here. Vocals are comparable to War Nerve, Suicide Note part II and Sandblasted Skin. The soundscape varies from The Crown, Acid Bath, and the second Superjoint album (Lethal Dose of American Hatred.) This is album is a cathartic, seismic and at times explosive. Anselmo really seems to be enjoying himself here and it is a ride that extreme metal fans have been waiting for for a very long time. Personally, I was afraid that after the demise of Superjoint, we would never hear this side of his vocal range again. Pick this album up - it is an awesome listen.
B004GYY714|4.0|This is so handy to listen to our local radio station while we are traveling.  Very nice feature and helpful when traveling.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|This was a cute movie.  The grandkids liked it and kept their attention.  We would rent it again in the future.
B0009UC810|1.0|Too late to return by a week.<br />Stops after 1hour 39 minutes and you have to skip to 1 hour and 55 minutes to get it to start again.<br /><br />DVDs and Blu-Ray disks often arrive not &#34;clicked&#34; in properly in thier boxes.  BE Warned to watch right away otherwise you will be stuck like i am.
B00A2BTCTC|5.0|The best deluxe version I've ever seen! I'm a big fan of Rush and this new edition of the 2112 album only increases my admiration for the Canadian trio!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Do not like the new format at all.  Confusing, hate the advertising, don't like the background photos.  Will be looking for a new weather app.
B00BCX2F66|5.0|Its a slim, quality case and looks unique compared to the other universal styling cases made for phones. The kickstand is a bonus feature to an already nice case.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I appreciate being able to use Kindle Reader on my Tablet and the selection of books available to me and my family.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|A great saga, characters you feel like you know. Sad to see some killed off. I'll be waiting for number three.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|This movie was all over the place and was ridiculous. It would go back and forth in history. Just a silly movie.
B00BEIYMAG|2.0|And unfortunately they have NOTHING to say.  So disappointed in this one.  I was a huge fan of Wan's &#34;Insidious&#34; and &#34;Saw,&#34; but this was really just much ado about nothing.  After I left the viewing, I thought the film should be retitled &#34;The Warren's Love Story.&#34;<br /><br />The possibilities were endless, but the director and screenwriter couldn't seem to make up their minds what they wanted to do.  If you plan to scare me, you're going to have to come up with something more than a unseen whatever pulling someone's leg.  I asked myself about a billion times why the family did not get rid of the infamous dresser, but then I don't think it would have really mattered.  When the backstory finally came into focus--so to speak--the movie did pick up a little, but before that I thought the movie was (I'm sorry to say) just plain old boring.  I mean, all this paranormal &#34;stuff&#34; was happening and all the family could do was have blank stares and dumb looks.  The &#34;jump&#34; moments in the movie did not work because the way any particular scene was shot, you KNEW something was going to happen.  The side story about the Warrens was not interesting and did not make one iota of sense.  In fact, towards the end of the film, the movie was just all over the place.  Had the filmmakers made more of the movie as intense as the exorcism, they might have had something.<br /><br />This movie is rated &#34;R&#34;...for no apparent reason.  I counted one cuss word; there is no nudity, very little blood, and certainly no gore.  Perhaps before the year is over, someone will be able to conjure a REAL scary movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a wonderful app and I think everyone should get it. This game is fun for all ages and FREE!
B00368PSN2|5.0|Is an okay film and as is ... it would be an okay Sci-fi B-Movie. Originally bouth it because had caught bit an peices of the film over the last few months so was dieing to see complete film. When did was a bit disapointed because it is an okay Sci-Fi B Movie. Then for a reason which couldn;t explain ... chose to review the deleated sceens. To my chagrin and amazment discovered a true Gem. Don't know who the editor is/was ... could look their name up yet would do no good ... these sceens 'made' and explained the film. I do hope an extended version is released, with the formerly deleted reintroduced, because then would they have a Top Drawer Sci-Fi A Movie ... it's approx 48 min's of deleted sceens .
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|Really bad movie. Depressing in my opinion. I watched it because I like the actors in the movie but it's like watch family members or neighbors with problems. yuck
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I laughed out loud and cried at times.  Mostly the funniest book I have read in ages.  Would recommend this one to anyone.  really really good.
B0091XICM0|4.0|I enjoyed the movie.  Its old and the effects aren't what you would see in new movies.  But if you want to enjoy an old classic movie, without swearing,nudity or gory effects, then sit back and enjoy.
B00B7VZN76|5.0|Was originally a bit of a  skeptic about the Blue Ray reporduction of a series which took a bit of time to grow on me ... well since picking up the first season and getting blown away. marking time waiting for season two by the time season three came around was on pins and needles for it to arrive. Blue Ray was made for Star Trek. I have a new appreciation for an old series. Wonderful work and great ride!
B006ZDU7QI|4.0|Gotye is super talented. He has a little bit of a Sting sound, but watching his videos along with listening to the music makes a world of a difference and shows you the amazing creativity in this guy. I will be awaiting new music from him.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Each puzzle is a little more advanced. Gotta purchase the full app for all the levels so I'm thankful I got coins!!
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|Hansel and Gretel is a great action film.  It is a new take on a great story.  I would definitely recommend watching it.
B002ZG98LO|4.0|Neat story and a good twist on an old franchize. Not sure where else 'it' can go yet can say uniquivably It is much better than Predator 2
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I have been reading the whole saga for a while and it is a lot of fun. My only objection is that you can easily get lost with so many characters as it is, and half of this book deals with another whole new set of people. But the author keeps you hooked. His descriptions are vivid, some of the characters are endearing and powerful like Tyrion, Jon, Arya, Danny, Brienne and Sansa. Others, we are still getting to know, as they have evolved, like Jaime. I just started the fifth book and it  already full of surprises.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|As always, Hosseini writes a powerful novel. Is historical and the characters weave a story that keeps interest. Will read again.
B0012TWRAO|4.0|The base for all RAM things.  Easy to install on my motorcycle bars.  Takes a while as the threads are long and the nyloc nuts take a lot of turns.  A deep 10mm socket would make it really easy. (I think it is metric...). Once it is there, it does exactly what it is for.  No complaints.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|i dont want to give this a star, but Why offer the cheats if we cant play the game on our Kindles, very very upset!!! :(
B004V9MU86|1.0|Sorry I only loved the begining, when the man bonds with the child so true to his style, it had a lovely genuine feel but then I didn't get gripped by anything else.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|Great series, good price, will watch for years to come, even though its available on Netflix, some shows you just want to own yourself.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I am the son of a B-17 airman. All things related to The Mighty 8th Air Force hold a fascination for me. I believe this is the best story of that period I have encountered. Since my father wouldn't talk much about his experiences after 25 missions, I am always trying to find out what happened then. This book does that in a very special way. Throughout the story, I was asking myself, could all  this really be true? As is so often the case, truth is stranger than fiction. I wish to sincerely thank the author for his work in bringing this story to the world rather than to have it lost forever.<br />OMG! I loved it and recommend it wholeheartedly.
B009IF82SK|5.0|A great cast; great writing; always a great time watching. I sure hope they were paid less than the cast of Friends. ;&#62;P
B0094BB4TW|2.0|This could be a good place to meet others if Facebook (how creepy) wasn't trying to get everyone together all the time, the unnecessary sharing of information becomes impossible to control as a result. The constant changing to let people find everyone they've ever known is also completely unnecessary...if we wanted to find them (or be found by them) we could.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I liked this movie because it shows that although one ages they still have the talents and feelings they had when they were younger. I think more people need to be aware of the gifts of those who have life experiences that can still be shared. Dustin Hoffman did a great job at directing the movie.
B0050VA428|3.0|This book overall was okay, at first, I was bored to death by it, but progressively, it got better. I'm in for more action packed books, but for those who love slower moving mystery books, especially those with murder/gorey details, this would be a great book.
B00CISC2DA|5.0|I am a fan that was really looking forward to this release.  I was counting down the days!!  When the day finally came and I sat down and listened, I was conflicted.  I couldn't decide if I really liked it or not.  The album had some great moments that seemed all to brief and fizzled out.  It seemed quite disjointed and didn't flow.  Campfire Headphase grabbed me immediately, so I was dissapointed that Tomorrow's Harvest didn't do the same for me.<br /><br />However, during the days and weeks that followed, I found that I kept putting this album on.  It wasn't a concious decision; I wasn't trying to like the album, I just felt drawn to it at some level.  Before I knew it, I discovered that I realy liked this album.<br /><br />This album is much darker than previous albums, almost sinister at times.  What I first thought of as disjointedness seems to be what ties the album together.  There are tracks that stand alone well, but the album is best enjoyed played from beginning to end.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is a really awesome game! it really makes you think. I love it! I cant wait for more episodes!
B00D2K40WY|5.0|this on the best game ever.  this game is made for all ages. I love this game because you daughters will be so happy that they made the right choice with this game so get this app.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|One must acknowledge genius when it occurs. While many other authors rewrite old tales and create variations on the old themes, only Neil Gaiman seems to be able to recognize the archetypal characters who exist in our real world. I love the way he can find Anansi or, in this book, the triple goddess, in the everyday world and allow us to find them as well. Metaphor is very much harder to write than simile or tribute. Gaiman consistently achieves metaphor in his prose. In doing so he reveals the supernatural in the natural course of our lives.
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|I've had this album in my colleciton since the late 90's.  As others here have said, this is a must-have for any Alice in Chains fan.<br /><br />I wasn't aware of this deluxe edition being released.  It came up in my Amazon suggestions and looked very interesting, so I grabbed it.<br /><br />I hadn't listened to this album in a number of years, so it was great to rediscover it.  What blew me away though was the concert video which I had never seen.  These guys were an INCREDIBLE live band.  Layne's vocals are just amazing - dead on with such emotion!  As I watched, I just couldn't stop thinking about what an amazing talent the world lost when Layne died.  So unique and talented.<br /><br />Mike McCreedy is on fire!  I never truely appreciated his guitar playing until watching him perform in this video.  Wow!!
B00ATP24NW|5.0|This group's music will be a classic for the Generations, Why you ask,,, Imagine... Actual Dragons making Music... no really, the songs are well orchestrated, the only drawback is their mixing guy used to much base, so... to fully enjoy, dial back the base frequency on your equalizer and then enjoy song after song after song...  note also their storied lyrics offer an insight into ageless life scenasiors every youth confronts and every middle ager remembers well... again to be enjoyed for generations!<br /><br />TAFA
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's great for all ages and fans of the movie. It's fantastic I play it when I'm bored and need to pass time
B005URRCUY|5.0|If you've never heard the Black Keys, or only heard them on the radio or something, this is probably the best 'starter' album.  Other albums are great too, but this one will get you hooked.
0547258305|1.0|I am a 25-year-old woman who loves young adult fantasy books for the innocence and romance -- you know, the princess/fairy tale feeling with a handsome prince charming.<br /><br />This book sorely disappointed me.  I don't read adult romance books because I don't want to read about them having sex.  This book should've had some type of warning in the beginning because I was half way through and the main characters decided to \\"become lovers.\\"  Katsa (the female lead) had a very negative view on marriage which greatly offended me as well as her diligence in taking her \\"birth control herbs.\\"<br /><br />You get the feeling that the author is some unmarried feminist who thinks pregnancy is some type of disease.  She gives young adults the message that premarital sex is okay.  I actually wouldn't be surprised if she was never with a man herself because she makes it seem like once you're intimate with someone you can just go back into yourself and no emotional attachments are made which is highly inaccurate.  Either that, or she was deeply hurt by a man and is trying to make herself feel better through her imaginary characters.<br /><br />This book is a waste of a read and despite having some interesting scenes and characters, the lack of morality and offensiveness of the characters completely ruined any chance this book had in becoming a time honored fantasy.
B004EPZ0AC|2.0|Not enough of Robin Williams character and Why was common in it. Not enough great singers and songs. Poor storyline.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|The levels are too randomized to be able to have a real chance at getting more than one star per level, if one is lucky. Not everybody has the ability to buy power ups or items that help them win. Besides, that is like winning with a handicap, which is kind of annoying. I understand this is just my opinion.
B003M70O5O|5.0|i am in love with this show.  have been following it since the first season and have not missed an episode yet!
B00CEJ2H6K|5.0|When I first heard the title track this spring, I was very hopeful for an album worthy of that track. No disappointment here as every song on this thing will have you howling through the night. The title track rages, as does As Loke Falls -  one of the best tracks Amon Amarth have written! Seriously! Father of the Wolf does not let up as does the next few. Hel is a bit different with Messiah as a guest vocalist. The last two songs (Coming of the Tide and Warriors of the North) fill the album out well. No filler here. Also the added CD of songs in the style of Judas Priest, Motorhead, Black Sabbath and AC/DC are very well done...especially Burning Anvil of Steel - praising the mighty Judas Priest...thumbs up all around!!!
B004EPZ03O|3.0|It wasn't like when I was a child,but it still was somewhat entertaining. Somewhat slow and cheesy. My favorite part was a diddy song by Chris Cooper it was shocking and funny to me that is.
B000IDEORY|5.0|Spent an enjoyable afternoon watching this movie. Favorite of mine.  Quality of picture and sound are excellent.  Will watch again sometime.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|it was very much what I expected it to be.  nothing special, and a good lead into the original wizard of Oz movie.
B005EGXNLS|4.0|I adore the Utred series! However the books are getting formulaic. They all are starting to follow the same pattern - the setup, the betrayal, the revenge, the battle & the wrap up. This book took me about a month to finish; normally I'm through the books in a day or 2. While it was interesting and I enjoyed it, it was hard to hold my attention. I sort of wish the series would start to wrap up. Does Utred get Bebbenburg back (I hope so)! Does he reconcile with his son (I hope so)! Does he turn Christian (I hope not).  Does he get together with Ethledfled (?) There is not really a lot more that needs to be said. While i Iove these books, I'm starting to not get quite as excited about them.<br /><br />The book is wonderfully written as usual. The scenery is beautiful, the characters interesting, the history magnificent. I love these books and would be sad to see the series wrap up - but I think it is about time.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|Spielberg outdone himself with cgi, the storyline was straight out of the book and it did not lose its integrity.
B0012HF5NC|5.0|Was great.  I always watch this on July fourth.  Quality was excellent.  Was really pleased with the clarity and sound.
B00553U3HM|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book as I do with all of Ken Follett's books.  Look forward to reading some more of the same

B007BZM3HK|4.0|Money maker,hopefully not a one hit wonder, The song was quirky and sugary sweet. My teenage daughter loved this song. I had no choice to like this song.<br /><br />All I have to say is &#34; Call Maybe or Maybe Not&#34;

0316056898|3.0|Had I heard Tina deliver her lines herself, surely I would have laughed more.  The written word in black and white on the page was amusing, but not as funny as I expected. She gave some good pointers for improvisational comedy, most useful, in my case, for conversation at social gatherings.  My overall impression was that Tina is reluctantly self-important, perhaps because she recognizes her career arc has been tied to Sarah Palin's and that might not be desirable in the long run.  She had a few reality checks and aha moments along the way, which made for interesting reading.  If you are a fan, you will love it.
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|Surprisingly good movie. Good story, acting better than normal, happy ending. Pretty active bits for a 65 year old. If your looking for a simple storyline to follow, good action, reasonable reality and one &#34;Super 'Vette&#34; you will find this entertaining. Plus I don't think I remember a bad word in the whole movie! (could be wrong?)
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This app is fun and even more fun. I personally suggest buying this app. It's got so many fun features and you can move the models around.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|Cute movie, even for adults!  Very funny and cute.  I'd definitely recommend this movie!  We saw it in anticipation of the sequel which came out this month, which, by the way, was really good also!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I got this yesterday and now I'm playing it all the time! But it's just a little bit confusing and needs more games on it.
B001N9ESQ4|1.0|Wow, was this movie a disappointment.  I cannot remember when I have seen a worse movie in my life.<br />The story dragged (real life story and tell left no sentence untold). R rated for why? Well, I guess the language got rancid on occasion. They sit, they bump into each other and reminisce about a long, lost love. By the end of the movie you are saying to yourself, what was this all about? Oh, yeah, a love affair. Well, no An Affair to Remember is this one. Make some popcorn and read a book. In fact, I would suggest watching a Hitchcock movie to get your blood circulating again. This is so-o-o-o-o sl-o-o-o-o-w that a cup of coffee will be needed to help you stay awake!

1439170916|5.0|Terrific read. I began reading this book unsure if I would finish it. This book grabbed me and for someone who doesn't read often I finished this book with reckless abandon.<br />I feel like everyone in the US should read this book. Cancer effects all of us greatly.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Don't know whether it is better to read the book first or see the movie. Both are first-rate for holding attention. Very clever writing and story-telling.
0062255657|5.0|The Ocean At The End Of The Lane is a beautifully written story of both magical realism and the way a child can feel terror. I loved the villains in this novel! It's every child's nightmare re. a caretaker. I also liked the wisdom in this book that everyone changes over time and experience, even experiences you can't remember.

B00CL68QVQ|3.0|This was a good movie and could have been much better without the use of the \\"f\\" word in every other sentence. I would not recommend this as a family movie because of that. The acting was good as was the plot. Please Hollywood .. movies can be attractive without all the cursing.

B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Initially, I was expecting a trite and cliche hero movie mashup. This movie truly caught me off guard with an excellent plot line driven by surprisingly convincing acting. Coming from a background where I have experience in film production, I would have to say at times this movie outdoes itself in production quality. Striking angles, sharp screenplay, vivid interpretations, and gritty realism all combined in a fantastical hero filled universe.<br /><br />Just what you always wanted, but done with class and style. Just the right touch of gritty, just the right touch of comic relief. This is one of the first hero movie that I revisited as soon as it came out on DVD, and every time I watch it I appreciate the subtle nuances and details that when into making the Avengers.<br /><br />On an ending note, it easily becomes evident that all the heroes (Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, Captain America) all do a better job in this movie than in their own individual movies. Captain American really stands apart from his movie (Which I thought was truly abysmal). Moreover,some of these actors aren't lead  quality AND THUS Robert Downey Jr. really pulls most of the weight serving as this movies \\"glue,\\" pulling it all together perfectly. The chemistry of this group is much better than any of them alone.<br /><br />Nicely Done!
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|This does NOT work on Kindle Fire.  Not sure what \\"Kindle Tablet\\" means, but I am out some money.<br />Seems like a trick to me to get people to buy it when it won't work on their Kindle.

B005CRQ4GU|1.0|Loved the book so much I wrote a book report on it and my class started to laugh so hard.
B009NG1Q96|2.0|The Selection was definitely better. The author had the perfect chance to end the series and she didn't. I think that was dumb. Also I feel like there should have been more action. Perhaps in the next book she will make some action. The Selection was definitely better and clearly more of a love story. I think that The Selection was definitely better than the Elite.<br />P. S. This book isn't as bad as Reached (by Ally Condie). It was slow paced like it but made more sense. Definitely.
B000002OG5|5.0|One of the best American movies ever made with outstanding performances by a remarkable cast. The cinematography and musical are haunting and unforgettable.
B0095P33IW|5.0|Does he or doesn't he... (Chris Evans on steroids that is)  Science fiction, villains more evil than Nazi's, Laser beams, submarines, love affair, and transforming a weakling into a super hero faster than you can say Jack LaLanne...  It's all here!  Spoiler alert:  the good guys win...
B008602KQI|5.0|Highly recommend everyone to watch. You'll see why once you do. I would use it for educational purposes with my kids.

B005MLOKXA|5.0|Very entertaining!  Great for summer viewing! Excellent character development.  Really enjoyed watching all three seasons back to back! Love using amazon prime
0525952926|5.0|I've enjoyed both Book One and Book Two of this trilogy.  Ken Follet has a way of making you feel as though you can actual see and feel what's going on with the characters at that time and place.
B00596WEVI|5.0|I was impressed by this film, it reminded me of the old French film noirs from when I was young.  I liked the directing, the choice of the colors, the acting and even the story.  JCVD with all the scars of his life written on his face did a great performance.  He has become a great actor who can do anything, not just Karate films.  Will he be the new Gabin? I don't know BUT the best of his acting career has just begun.

0880793082|2.0|I ordered this deck under the impression that this was the 80 card tarot thoth deck with the two extra magician trump cards. It was not. The real 80 card Thoth deck comes with 80 tarot cards total. This one only had 78 cards with two filler cards to make it 80, thus making this product look like the 80 card thoth deck. The only reason it gets two stars instead of one is because it was a tarot deck.
B00AL6SLQS|5.0|Leon Fleisher was already established as one of America's greatest pianists when, in his late 30s, his performing career was curtailed due to difficulties with his right hand.  While Fleisher received conflicting diagnoses and medical advice, he continued to serve music by conducting, teaching, and performing the limited repertoire for left-hand alone.  By the time he returned to two-handed performing about ten years ago, he was an elder statesman.<br /><br />From the beginning, Fleisher had an impressive resume.  As a child, Pierre Monteux lauded him as \\"the pianistic find of the century\\".  Soon thereafter, he began studies with Artur Schnabel - who usually avoided teaching child prodigies. Fleisher emerged as a musician with a similar sensibility to his teacher: faithful to the composer's text; technique solely at the service of the music; a repertoire that embraced the classics from Mozart to Schubert and dipped into the Romantics/Impressionists only slightly. But there were differences as well.  Fleisher also played 20th Century repertoire - particularly American composers who Schnabel would have never touched. Fleisher was far more secure technically than his teacher.  His playing was metrically straighter than Schnabel's, who couldn't help being born in the freer 19th Century; and Fleisher didn't have that individualized sound that Schnabel, like all Letschetizky pupils, possessed.<br /><br />Fleisher's debut recording was Schubert's B-flat Sonata and some dances.  In the Sonata, the pianist eschews the first movement repeat and there is an overall lack of atmosphere, poetry, or mystery.  Fleisher plays all the notes, but there's little sense of what's going on behind them.  The pianist returned to the B-flat Sonata (with repeat) for Vanguard in 2004 and I recommend that recording without reservation.  Fleisher's last recording before his retirement included a stunning Wanderer Fantasy, delivered with structural continuity, honesty of technique, and aplomb - although there's a painfully obvious splice a few seconds toward the end.  The Op. 120 Sonata flows with an unforced lyricism in the first two movements, transitioning to a playful finale.<br /><br />Fleisher successfully captures the contrasting moods of Brahms' Handel Variations: from the rather academic presentation of the theme, to the variations which are by turns jocular, mysterious, majestic, virtuosic, and reflective, all leading to a marvelously presented fugue.  Likewise, each of the 16 waltzes is given its own individual mood.<br /><br />In Debussy's Suite Bergamasque, Fleisher does not go for the \\"hammerless piano\\" approach championed by Gieseking: every note is firmly on the ground.  While the clarity and rhythmic vivacity in the Prelude is appreciated, the lack of color drains the other movements of their charm: You'll never hear a drier Claire de Lune than here.  Fleisher is more successful in Ravel's Sonatine and Valses - although Rubinstein really owned the latter.  In the end, these are serviceable rather than distinguished readings.  The high point of this disc is Ravel's Alborada del gracioso, where Fleisher perfectly captures the meld of the Spanish idiom with the French composer.<br /><br />Fleisher keeps Liszt's B minor Sonata moving, giving even the slower sections a sense of momentum - and the entire piece has a dramatic through line.  I've never been able to get into Weber's Sonata and that didn't change with this recording.  Fleisher's performance of Invitation to the Dance brings back memories of Schnabel's recording of that piece, although Fleisher's clarity in several of the parallel runs goes beyond what his teacher achieved.<br /><br />American piano music: Copland's sole Piano Sonata is given a searching, searing reading - the rather brightly voiced piano suits the starkness of the piece.  Rorem's Three Barcarolles, works which deserve to be heard more often, are played with untrammeled lyricism, even in the lively final work.  The remaining pieces were, frankly, less interesting - works by composers riding contemporaneous trends rather than genuine composing (the Kirchner Sonata, in particular, sounds like warmed over Messiaen).<br /><br />For many, the highlight of this set will be Fleisher's collaboration with George Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra - Fleisher's exclusive orchestral recording partner until his hand troubles.  Fleisher's crisp, no-nonsense phrasing works well with Szell's whip-cracking intensity, even in music where one wouldn't expect them to excel - like Rachmaninoff's Paganini Rhapsody.  This is a performance of which the composer (who eschewed sentimentality in his own performances) would have approved. The Franck Symphonic Variations gets off to a measured start and only catches fire in the last few minutes.<br /><br />One certainly can't say Mozart's Concerto 25 is lacking in fire, even though it's in the benign key of C major.  Szell starts the first movement in crisply articulated style, with a brisk tempo, and Fleisher carries the piano part with subtle pedaling and astutely-judged dynamics.  The songful andante features glowing woodwinds, while the finale is graceful whirl and dash.  (Fleisher himself conducts the Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra in three Mozart concertos on the final disc of this set, recorded in 2008.  The performances are relaxed and autumnal; any doubts as to Fleisher's recovery fade upon hearing the clear and articulate right hand passagework.)  In keeping with the custom of his generation, Fleisher does not embellish the rather bare bones piano part in the slow movements.<br /><br />Fleisher and Szell initially recorded Beethoven's G major Concerto (coupled with Mozart's Concerto 25), and only wound up recording the whole cycle after a casual suggestion by the recording producer, Howard Scott.  We owe Mr. Scott a big round of applause, as this possibly the finest Beethoven Piano Concerto cycle by an American pianist, orchestra, and conductor (Szell took United States citizenship in 1946).  The G major has just the right balance of lyricism, pathos (in the central movement) and sparkle.  Fleisher's playing in the two early concertos serves as a reminder that Beethoven initially conquered Vienna as a virtuoso pianist, not a composer - the way he tears through the cadenza in the opening movement of Concerto 1 is beyond brilliant.  Szell matches Fleisher bar-for-bar with tightly coiled conducting, except in the middle movements which are expansive without lapsing into sogginess.  That's also largely true of the C minor concerto, which is played through a classicist's prism.  The Emperor Concerto is largely devoid of the pomp usually heard; this monarch is lean and lithe, wearing his imperial garb lightly.  Mutuality is everywhere evident in this cycle.<br /><br />The Brahms D minor Concerto is given a propulsive, dynamic performance that reminds the listener that the composer was a young man when this was written.  Fleisher's playing is vibrant without being forced, while Szell manages to make the rather muddy orchestration sound lean and clear.  The B-flat Concerto is exceptionally detailed, helped by Fleisher's sparing use of the sustaining pedal.  Jules Eskin's cello solo in the slow movement is beyond beautiful, and integrally balanced with the accompaniment.  By and large, these are my favorite stereo Brahms concertos, although I wouldn't want to be without Rubinstein/Reiner in the D minor.<br /><br />One wouldn't normally associate the Fleisher/Szell partnership with Grieg and Schumann, but the popular coupling of A minor Concertos are presented with freshness, crisp attacks in the faster sections, and relaxed, unforced poetry in the slow movements.<br /><br />Brahms' Liebeslieder Waltzes, with Rudolf Serkin on the other piano, are given a reflective, flexible rendition.  Fleisher and the Juilliard String Quartet are seamlessly integrated in the F minor Quintet - this is chamber playing at its finest.<br /><br />Left Hand works:  It has been said that art thrives on limitations, and this may be the case with Fleisher.  For one thing, he was compelled to explore repertoire he might have otherwise ignored, such as Godowsky and Saint-Saëns.  The various left-hand performances here are freer, more interesting, and have a greater variety of tonal color (although that may be, in part, a result of recording technology).  Further, despite using only one hand, the dynamics are multi-layered in a way lacking in the earlier recordings.  The separation of voices as heard in the solo album (particularly in the two Scriabin works) is astonishing.  Whatever the repertoire, Fleisher remains a solid musician, and his Ravel concerto (normally a showpiece for pianists to demonstrate their left hand technique) has a sense of structural solidity that makes the performance all the more exciting.  Ozawa and the Boston Symphony furnish an able accompaniment here and in the Prokofiev and Britten works.<br /><br />This 23CD set contains all of Fleisher's recordings for Columbia/Epic and Sony.  He made a few recordings for Vanguard which are not included: [[ASIN:B0002IQHHK Two Hands]], and [[ASIN:B000GYHQZ2 The Journey]]; collectors should seek these out.  This box is presented in the original album format, which means most of the discs have short playing times, but the sequencing of the works is as originally intended by the performer.  The front and back covers are reproduced, so with a magnifying glass, the original liner notes can be read - but the last four albums did not have liner notes on the back cover.took United States citizenship in 1946).  The G major has just the right balance of lyricism, pathos (in the central movement) and sparkle.  Fleisher's playing in the two early concertos serves as a reminder that Beethoven initially conquered Vienna as a virtuoso pianist, not a composer - the way he tears through the cadenza in the opening movement of Concerto 1 is beyond brilliant.  Szell matches Fleisher bar-for-bar with tightly coiled conducting, except in the middle movements which are expansive without lapsing into sogginess.  That's also largely true of the C minor concerto, which is played through a classicist's prism.  The Emperor Concerto is largely devoid of the pomp usually heard; this monarch is lean and lithe, wearing his imperial garb lightly.  Mutuality is everywhere evident in this cycle.<br /><br />The Brahms D minor Concerto is given a propulsive, dynamic performance that reminds the listener that the composer was a young man when this was written.  Fleisher's playing is vibrant without being forced, while Szell manages to make the rather muddy orchestration sound lean and clear.  The B-flat Concerto is exceptionally detailed, helped by Fleisher's sparing use of the sustaining pedal.  Jules Eskin's cello solo in the slow movement is beyond beautiful, and integrally balanced with the accompaniment.  By and large, these are my favorite stereo Brahms concertos, although I wouldn't want to be without Rubinstein/Reiner in the D minor.<br /><br />One wouldn't normally associate the Fleisher/Szell partnership with Grieg and Schumann, but the popular coupling of A minor Concertos are presented with freshness, crisp attacks in the faster sections, and relaxed, unforced poetry in the slow movements.<br /><br />Brahms' Liebeslieder Waltzes, with Rudolf Serkin on the other piano, are given a reflective, flexible rendition.  Fleisher and the Juilliard String Quartet are seamlessly integrated in the F minor Quintet - this is chamber playing at its finest.<br /><br />Left Hand works:  It has been said that art thrives on limitations, and this may be the case with Fleisher.  For one thing, he was compelled to explore repertoire he might have otherwise ignored, such as Godowsky and Saint-Saëns.  The various left-hand performances here are freer, more interesting, and have a greater variety of tonal color (although that may be, in part, a result of recording technology).  Further, despite using only one hand, the dynamics are multi-layered in a way lacking in the earlier recordings.  The separation of voices as heard in the solo album (particularly in the two Scriabin works) is astonishing.  Whatever the repertoire, Fleisher remains a solid musician, and his Ravel concerto (normally a showpiece for pianists to demonstrate their left hand technique) has a sense of structural solidity that makes the performance all the more exciting.

B009HNDTPO|5.0|I really liked espisode 23.  The ending really did have a twist!  I can't wait for season 9 to start this fall.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The only thing I don't like is that they killed off a major character at the end of season 3, in a somewhat gratuitous way.
B008B1BL4E|5.0|,,, but here they are! In all of their full glory (and perfidity). My grandfather & grandmother would have absolutely never have met except for the First World War (WW1). The events that lead up WW1 are still being argued about today. Was it necessary? Could it have been prevented? Why wasn't it over by Christmas 1914? Who actually started the war? How come no one expected (yet another) small scale conflict in the Balkans (effectively, the third Balkan War) expand with such devastating consequences? This book doesn't answer all of these questions, but it does go into great depth in discussing the change of alliances and the machinations of the principals over the prior 50 years as Europe slowly girdled itself towards total war.<br /><br />It is a detailed and very good read. Please note however that, unless you are interested in deep research & analysis, this book is not for you. It is *not* light reading & in some cases is a very good cure for insomnia! That said, it's a good 5* in my book.<br /><br />Personal note: My grandfather was an infantry soldier in the French Army in 1914. He was captured in March 1915 on the Western Front & was sent to a German POW camp in the state of Hanover. The POW camp was a prison farm. My grandfather met the farmer's daughter & after the war married her. (Definitely a match that would not have ever been made except for the war.) So, I definitely have a personal bias on how studying the and why the war started.
B001NHNG64|5.0|This is a pretty good book.It kept you guessing what would happen.I would recommend this book to others. It was exciting
B0074VTHKM|5.0|Written by my 12 year old son who formerly hated to read: \\"Awesome<br />The best I don't want to ever stop reading it so you should read it to to is interesting.\\"  That says it all!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|A refreshing, entertaining and inspiring read!! At times I felt as though Ms Grout had read my mind and I felt awed that she had the courage to write and publish things that I have thought about and was afraid to even voice far less commit to writing for the world to see. She has given me the courage to be true to myself and voice my beliefs even when they seem unconventional and controversial.<br />All the experiments did not work for me but that did not detract from the value of the book in outlining and simplifying Universal Truths.<br />BUT......I take strong objection to the DELIBERATE omission to credit Bob Marley where credit was due for the quote \\"Emancipate yourself from mental slavery none but ourselves can free our minds.\\" I am convinced it was deliberate because the simplest of searches would have revealed that the late great Robert Nester Marley was the author of this quote. I leave it to the reader to ponder the reason for this deliberate omission and come to his or her own conclusion.<br />In addition, the reference to the foreign college student who did not know what a telephone was, was just plain stupid. Simply taking the word \\"foreign\\" out of the sentence shows how stupid it is. What college student would not know what a telephone is? It is in such simple statements that one's deep-seated prejudices are revealed. Foreigners are seen by some as backward and illiterate; and yes there are backward and illiterate foreigners just as there are backward and illiterate people all over the world. However I dare you to find me one college student, foreign or otherwise who does not know what a phone is.<br />Perhaps Ms Grout forgot that even the Flintstones had phones!!
B005HEF8V0|4.0|Too much like TNG. Stand alone shows and alien of the week. Still, well thought out scripts helps. Still could use more action
B008D30K7E|3.0|This book had a great title and got loads of publicity. It was an unusual idea and was amusing - but a re-doing of Forest Gump really - though fortunately not as sentimental.<br /><br />An enjoyable light read but did not live up to the hype.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|For the second time my family and I went to the John Adams homes in Massachusetts.  We recently went with my brother, cousin and two friends from Virginia.  They had such a good time that I decided to send my cousin the HBO series so that she could enjoy it as much as I have enjoyed the one I purchased earlier.  Definitely a five star documentary worth keeping.
B008JFUNYG|5.0|This movie was a fantastic attempt.<br /><br />I have to say that I really enjoyed this movie. It is a remake so clearly if you have seen the original it will be may be difficult to enjoy this film. If you are at all accepting of remakes I think that you will enjoy this.<br /><br />This movie takes the 80's version and does try to update it. This movie has non of the suspense of the original but it definitely has a really fun amount of gore. I am hesitating to use the word creative here but there is definitely a but more to the bloodiness of this than the original. There are many cringe-inducing moments that come along with the buckets of blood.<br /><br />The characters start out a bit wooden but some of them do shine a bit more than you would expect. One thing I have to say about this movie is that I really feel that it did a good job of keeping me guessing as to who would be the new Ash. We know there will be a survivor in the end, and without having watched any of the trailers I really felt the suspense as to who would be crowned the King Baby.<br /><br />It is extremely difficult to separate Ash from the Evil Dead Series, but I do think that this movie is as successful as you are going to get. They didn't try to just have a new zany character that acts just like him, attempting to do such a thing would have felt as natural as Ted McKinleys presence in the final seasons of Happy Days. I would also love to argue that people mainly love the evil dead series due to the comedy aspects of parts 2 and 3 but I am very affraid of the backlack I might receive. This movie attempts to do what the original did in its own way and I think it was successful.
B007KDFWRG|5.0|great deal. My brother weas very happy.  So was I.  It was good and great and grand and super duper
B007XNAQLA|5.0|I gave it a 5 star the minute a heard the first song. I though the boys are back with two new guys(to rtf) and that's why the music sounds so different. Hearing some of the old songs being played with JLP& Thunder from down under, they sounded fresh/new.  What I would of liked for this new RTF4, would of been new music from all of them, but re-working the classics is more thank ok.  I would recommend this recording to all RTF fans & Jazz fans & also to anyone who likes good music, after all, listen to who is doing the solos.  PS. Thanks to the dvd, you get to see the solos.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|I bought this movie as gift for my seven year old and both he and I have enjoyed it to no ends. Very heart felt a great family movie.
0307887448|5.0|Do not stop and think about this, simply start reading this book now.<br /><br />This book is fantastic. It focuses heavily on the video game universe past and present but there really is something here for everybody.<br /><br />I have read this book and recommended it to multiple people of different ages and backgrounds and they all love about it. While it's not fair to compare this book to Harry Potter or The Hunger Games, I will do so anyway. This book has the same obvious traits that you find in an underdog-centric young adult novel, but it also has ta magnetic affect and will not let you put the book down.<br /><br />I do not want to go too far into details about the story itself but I will say that the intriguing part is that it is about a young male who is racing the rest of the world to compete in a contest.<br /><br />Probably on of the most exciting aspects of the book is that it is in a world that is a very convincing vision of the not-to-distant future. The world itself is science fiction yet plausible. In addition to this the world is very well thought out. Throw in some inspiring characters and you have a book that is sure to only grow in popularity as the years go by.
B0067RQYNW|3.0|I like having it in an emergency but I sure could use an instruction guide.  I am just learning how to do spreadsheets so am not real versed in what is possible and what this program will support.

0823013626|4.0|Though I love the visuals in this book the techniques need some time to be absorbed.  While not a rank novice, I found some of the instructions a little involved.  With some time to practice the different lessons,, I am sure this book will become a favorite..
B005LAII44|5.0|Now I don't yet have it let alone purchased it, but I saw it in the movies and it was AWESOME. It was devastating that the Joes' lost nearly all they're comrades, Duke Included - He was a good friend to RoadBlock. Now Cobra's new mask, it works for him. When I heard Storm Shadow said he wants to help the Joes just this once, I was with Agent Flint on this one. However, the Neuclear Missile System made by Cobra was really inpressive, it was able to Desimate the entire London City; meanwhile, Zartan Disguised as the predisent picked a rediculous time to play Angry Birds, I said: Suriously? But overall, the movie was AWESOME.

B00DBSZJRM|5.0|This was a very good movie from start to finish. I enjoyed it so much, that I was sad to see it come to an end. I'm truly hoping for a sequel. Nice going Amazon. Keep getting movies like this one, and you'll knock Red Box out of the Box!

B00CW665VI|5.0|This book had me laughing my ass off. Its nice to see his POV for a change and actually talk to the reader. Guys tend to be funnier, up font about things and get a way with saying certain things. Good story, wish we can have more.

B0076DCT2G|4.0|I usually love Nelson DeMille's books and did enjoy this one.  I think it could have moved faster without all of John's negative remarks.  He gave to much away and I knew how it would end before it did.  I like the suspense at the end.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|Excellent DVDs.  Excellent on historical facts, fabulous costumes and great job by the actors.  I highly recommend this set to others. Vendor excellent.  Jeeanne
