B00CWVGBEO|4.0|Arnold Schwarzenegger makes this movie. His presence helps the other actors you can see. Not the best Arnold Schwarzenegger movie ever made, but its good to see him back on the screen again. Worth the watch
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I bought this device for less than $40 bucks.  It is completely worth it.  It plugs into an HDMI port on more modern televisions.  It does not work on old boob tubes as far as I know.  I used it Saturday night and we played music from youtube all night directly on my tv.  No dragging our WII from my room or the PS3 from the game room.  It is also smooth uninterrupted play.  I did not see one time our song freezing so it could buffer.  I would definitely recommend this product to friends!  I am also definitely going to buy it as a Christmas gift for people this Christmas!  I have tried Netflix, no problems, and I have not tried Hulu Plus yet, which was actually the main reason I bought it.  I hate watching my shows on my laptop.  I like being cozy on my couch.  The controller (my phone) was easy to install and easy to use.  A+++++
B00271DNP4|5.0|Probably my favorite in the whole series. The kids really grew into their acting skills by the time this movie was made.
B009P7C7XW|5.0|They are the best! Their songs last for a lifetime! I repeatedly listen all their songs and it never stops to amazed me
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|i found it easy reading--it kept me interested to the very end. and the ending was quite a surprise<br />.
B00DHHWXYY|1.0|The DVD is extremely poor quality. It was a total rip off. I couldnt even sit through the first 10 minutes of the movie. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS BUYER! I would have tried to return it and get my money back, but I purchased the DVD as a gift for someone else and didnt realise the condition of the DVD until much later after I purchased it.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Love the fast pace of the show.  Love all the characters. Alicia is such a strong character.  Sometimes I feel like she needs a good cry though.
0061906220|5.0|My son learned about Pete in his Kindergarten class and begged me to buy this book. Of course, anything to help him learn to read that is also fun and educational is a great thing! I bought this, along with several others.<br />The publisher has free song downloads on their website to accompany some of the books.<br />I downloaded them onto his little mp3 player (with the ton of other kid songs and bible songs) and he listens to it as he follows along in the book! It's AWESOME!
B0038P59A0|5.0|I loved the action and the scenery was so realistic for London.  It kept me in suspense.  I love everything Robert Downing Jr. does
B000RZOR2U|1.0|Both original item and it's replacement I received had the same issue; wrong contents in CD #51 and #52.  I guess these defects came from the defects of original MASTER CDs.<br />As a result of the issue, BWV170 - BWV176 are missing from the &#34;complete&#34; sacred cantatas. The vendor of this product  should recall them from the market immediately.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Loved it! Kept me on the edge of my seat all the time.  It as so fast paced and great acting
0345545338|4.0|This is a fun page-turner with a lot of the tropical scenes well-detailed. There were a couple of points where I was getting quite suspicious of our first-person narrator as he seemed to be holding some details back...and he was! But it was overall a good time and the legal details are not too complex and easy to follow.

B00E0SX118|3.0|My 3yr old and 5yr old liked it, but it's not one they have asked to watch again and again.<br />I don't think they have mentioned it since the day we saw it. That being said, it is worth a few bucks.
B0017SWSCW|5.0|I loved the book.. it kept my attention all the way through.  I have loved most of his books.The read very fast.

B00CWV8X04|3.0|Had some spooling  problems with the site. Gave up. Hope to watch it now that my  connection is better.  amazon could use a  better spooling function like Netflix.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Excellent product. HULU works well. I will be buying on for each TV in the house. Should cost more than 35.00
193700788X|1.0|What a heartfelt letdown. I've never been so disappointed in a series ending before. Please write an alternate ending? Maybe that could give me some closure.
B003NS2T9G|5.0|Even better than Dr. Who.  Enjoyed all 3 seasons of Torchwood. Hope that  Prime will add Season 4 in the near future.
0812550706|5.0|My ten year old is reading this for a fifth grade project. He loved the book and it was in great condition. Just took a bit to get here.
1451696191|5.0|I had heard this book was considered as a book to be banned in Ohio high schools by the president of the Ohio Board of Education and wanted to try to understand why.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|This book was ok, I wouldn't say that it is the best book I have ever read because it took too long to get to the heart of the story.  A lot of psychoanalysis but then again there is a professional in this story that has this work for her living. So some of what was said in the book is very true to life so you come away with some knowledge.
B00884GR0W|5.0|I love this game it is  so addicting so much fun loads fast you get awesome tools an  I got the full version for free for the free app of the day!!!! I air give up all my apps for this one if I didn't have it already

B005OCFGTO|4.0|The movies are great, but the case isn't the best. I had it for 2 weeks and the DVD holder's on the inside broke loose of the actually case framework. It is still functioning, but it gets annoying when they fall out of the case sometimes. I have to get them in there just right in order to make the case shut properly.

B00867HDTA|5.0|This is by far the best soccer game you can get for free. There is some amazing curving action that you can create while the ball is in the air. There is a lot of skill required to make some of the shots which makes it a very fun but difficult game.
0446343129|5.0|Sugar Blues, which I first read in 1978 when I was 35 years old, is the most important book I've ever owned.  I always have several copies on hand and give one to anybody who asks me the question, &#34;How do you stay so slim and so healthy?&#34;

B007THA4FI|2.0|I really really wanted to like this book, but I just could never get into the story or the characters.
B003B02O7I|3.0|This feels like a book that was written to meet a contractual obligation, rather than a heartfelt story...... It certainly belongs in the bottom tier of Grisham's work.

B00C2VIA52|4.0|Definitely enjoying the game. I wish I could play it without internet but other than<br />that it's well worth playing.
B00BSBUZPK|1.0|Thank you for the opportunity of expressing my thoughts about the DVD, &#34;History of the Eagles&#34;.  I am an Eagles fan.  We just traveled to Seattle in Sept. to see their concert (3 states away). However, I purchased the History of the Eagles for me, my wife and our children to enjoy.  I was disgusted by the crude language and especially the pornography in the DVD.  This was put together by a well known documentarian. I truly expected a little higher class coverage of the history of the eagles.  Was it really necessary to have the F word and other vulgarity throughout the DVD?  Was it really necessary to have a night club scene with a nude woman dancing?  I feel that if the content of this DVD included X rated material, it surely should have had the rating right on the site where the DVD was being sold.  I would encourage you to do that so future customers don't make the same mistake that I did.<br /><br />Thanks!!
6305428042|5.0|I love this movie so much, its pretty much impossible to find in stores, even if you look around halloween time! I was so excited to see that Amazon offered it at an affordable price!

B009JZWO3I|5.0|Just the right balance of drama, comedy and action. Memorable characters and good actors. Also, I learned a little bit about our judicial system.
0451204530|3.0|Code to Zero is a decent read if you have time to kill on an airplane or sitting in waiting rooms. But given Ken Follet's greatest works -- e.g., Triple, Eye of the Needle, Pillars of the Earth -- this book is most certainly wanting.<br /><br />There's really not much more to say. There's a likable scientist-hero who unwittingly gets embroiled in a Cold War struggle that goes back to his college days. There is an evil former friend, a beautiful woman, a lackluster wife. There's a plot to blow up a missile, some thrills and chills (that aren't all that thrilling or chilling) and a happy ending.<br /><br />If you haven't already read one of Follet's better books, skip this one and go to the good stuff.
B00D2CYU2W|5.0|Excellent movie. Great acting and great writing.never easy to tell the story of someone so famous. Not to be missed.
B00EU9VCKO|5.0|I've used a lot of these photo editing apps. This is by far the best combination of ease of use with great results. Icons are super clear on my tablet, making previewing go way fast.  If you like retro, you want this. Cheaper than a Big Mac.

B005544TRQ|5.0|could not get enough of this story? watched the episodes back to back.! Great characters and very well written. 5 stars
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Well written but predictable YA novel about death, contextualized by cancer.  Characters are a bit too mature and well balanced for their age and situation, but this may make it a helpful tool for kids going through their own issues.  I would not recommend to people with cancer, as it may hit too closely, but a good read for adjacent issues.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I bought the chromecast hoping to be able to stream material from my chromebox to the TV.  After a couple of days trying to get it to work with no success i called google for help.  They told me that chromebox was not compatible with chromecast.  I then began the process of trying to send it back and get a refund.  Instead of taking the information online they said the case would be referred to their service department.  Several weeks later and numerous calls i finally got the return label.  i sent the chromecast back as instructed and now it's been over three weeks of waiting.  i called service again and they said they would refer the case to another department, but they could not check on the status of the return.<br />So, before you order a chromecast, be sure its compatible with whatever you're going to hook it up with.  Otherwise, you will have a long and frustrating experience with trying to get service and your return money.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|Greatly entertaining read about the facebook/google/twitter era taken to it's logical and scary conclusion.  Really strong characters and story that pulls you along for the ride.
0385523394|5.0|I liked the miniseries, but that was simple entertainment. This is both more poignant and arresting than the series. Piper writes a compassionate, eye-opening treatise on the plight of many women in the system, humanizing them and exposing the dreadful rehabilitation (or lack thereof) in the system today. Having a degree in sociology from many moons ago and a few visits to women's prisons under my belt from my idealistic youth, this book rocked me to my core. I've given it to anyone from my ultra-conservative mother to clients and colleagues. It's really an engaging, well-written book that challenges your perceptions of prison and opens your eyes to the failures in the war on drugs and sentencing guidelines for women. Decades of advocacy for female offenders have made less progress than you might expect. I was deeply saddened and challenged, while being entertained and engaged with her beautiful character development. Good stuff. 1000 times more worth the read than most of the fluff you see on the shelves today, and infinitely better than the hyper-sexualized series on hulu.
B00FEN1C50|2.0|It was hard to distinguish the totality of this film from the original Godzilla with Raymond Burr.  It resembled the traditional Japanese monster films from the 1950's with the exceptions that the international content was increased with a little variety in actors as well as the effects budget which provided for little more than the old time slow frame rate filming of miniature monster figures in miniature cities.  Great Saturday matinee fare for those up to the age of adolescence, but a lousy cartoonish film for adults.  There was an attempt to add meaning/interest through the interaction of several divergent character pairings , but that added so little, why bother?  This film was not much more than a cartoonish battle between giant man made robots and huge alien monsters that somehow just appeared from deep in the pacific ocean.  There was so little realism in the CGI that most had to be muted or obscured by a dark sets and backdrops that made the flash of lights more pronounced but hid virtually all detail.  I rated the film with 2 stars only because I believe there is a young audience who might find some excitement in the Godzilla-like story.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Watched many episodes back to back. Unfortunately You have to pay if you want to see season !  So I will wIt
B006M7JCC2|4.0|(...the subject matter deserves 5 stars as does Anita's sharing of her experiences and story... the writing is, unfortunately, barely 3 stars...And I say this regretfully because I am VERY happy to hear and read this account!)<br />I LOVE what Anita Morrjani has to share! I  listened to her interview on Buddha at the GasPump and found her to be  articulate, deeply insightful, sincere, authentic, and most inspiring! Having had a number of experiences in line with what she is talking about, I was and am delighted to find this type of experience expressed in interviews and books!  So, after hearing her interview,  I bought several copies for myself and a couple of friends. Unfortunately the book is not at all well edited and this detracts from the account and causes the reading of it to be cumbersome. Nevertheless,  I don't want to discourage anyone from buying the book because I think it is really important material and a significant contribution.  Anita may, for example, explain that at a certain point in her life she was worried about what people thought of her. She adequately elaborates on this in a paragraph or two (perhaps offering examples) providing the reader a clear understanding of her emotions.  However, over the course of the next several pages the same statements are repeated over and over again. This turns the reading into a redundant experience. I would be happy  to see the book thoroughly edited and re-published. This story is well worth it!
B00E0SX118|4.0|Movie whole family will enjoy. Great casting of characters makes it feel authentic and rich. One you'll want to watch again and again.
B008XBHIEY|5.0|I was walking out of the theater after introducing a friend of mine to this movie (something I often did that summer), when I noticed he was white as a sheet. When I asked him why, he said: \\"I grew up in Daytona Beach, Florida, and we used to go swimming in the ocean at night all the time. I had no idea there were things like that in the water!\\" Another friend heard the following remark as he left a theater after a screening: \\"Man, I've seen scary movies before, but goddamn!\\" Those were typical reactions among moviegoers during the summer of 1975. Jaws genuinely terrified people. They didn't know it at the time, but they were witnessing the beginning of a phenomenon: the summer blockbuster craze. Jaws launched a trend that has continued ever since, as people flock to the movies during the summer to be scared, thrilled or tickled to death by the best effects and pop-spectacle that Hollywood can deploy.<br /><br />Everyone should know this particular story by now: A great white shark stakes out territory in the waters off the popular but fictional New England island of Amity (it was shot on Martha's Vineyard) and starts munching on swimmers. The local chief of police (Roy Scheider), a marine biologist (Richard Dreyfuss) and an obsessive shark hunter (Robert Shaw) set out to catch and kill the beast. They do find it but in the process get much more than they bargained for. Director Steven Spielberg and screenwriter Carl Gottlieb took Peter Benchley's rather pedestrian best-selling novel and, with the help of Verna Fields, the veteran film editor, the brilliant music of John Williams, and the tremendously appealing performances of the three lead actors and the entire supporting cast, streamlined it into an express train of a thriller. It grabs you from the very first deep bass-violin stroke of the score that made Williams a legendary composer - and about whom Spielberg wrote: \\"He has made our movie more adventurous, gripping and phobic than I ever thought possible.\\" Some of the mechanical shark scenes seem dated in this age of CGI, but there's still no denying its power and sense of adventure - and its surprising amount of humor. This many years later it remains one of the very best of the summer blockbusters. [[ASIN:B00HU8VK4K Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)]]
B00FHAB3HW|4.0|I like it! Great Job Miley! Especially for us getting over a bad heartbreak. WRECKING BALL is my fave! Overall I like 80% of the album and for me that's a lot!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I would give this great story 4.5 stars. I savored the book throughout and didn't want it to end. I actually rationed it so that I wouldn't finish it too quickly!<br /><br />I love Stephen King, but not everything he writes. I adore his early and mid-career horror novels, but I got turned off by a lot of his newer works starting with The Green Mile. Under the Dome gave me renewed hope, and Dr. Sleep shows that he's definitely still got it after all these years.<br /><br />This is a very different book than The Shining. While there is some overlap, this has nothing much to do with what happened when Dan was a little boy at the Overlook Hotel (even though the Overlook ruins feature prominently here, as do some memories about the malevolent creatures that lurked inside).<br /><br />This is instead a story about Dan and a new, charming main character, a young girl named Abra. Abra has &#34;the shining&#34; even more strongly than Dan ever did. Unfortunately, we come to learn that there is a group of very evil vampire-like creatures called The True Knot that murders children with the shining to &#34;suck out their steam&#34; (their shining) after slowly torturing them to death (torturing them &#34;purified the steam&#34;). Disguised as benevolent senior citizens in RVs, the True Knot wanders America's highways looking for &#34;steamhead&#34; children to kill. They use their steam as a fountain of youth, keeping themselves alive for thousands of years. Led by a stunningly beautiful woman called Rose the Hat (the members of the tribe use mobster names), these villains are very interesting and scary.<br /><br />As I said, I loved this book. The ending, however, slightly disappointed me. The book builds up to a spectacular showdown between Abra and Dan versus the True Knot. I was so excited for it, turning the pages on my Kindle with great anticipation. I was looking forward to a huge good vs. evil battle that King does so well (as in The Stand, for example, which had an ending I loved). I won't write any spoilers here, but I was disappointed. It wasn't terrible by any means, but it did leave me saying &#34;That's it? Seriously?&#34; At the same time, I went back and re-read the climax several times, proving it was still enjoyable.<br /><br />I also would have liked more history about the True Knot members. The story about their murder of the baseball boy was horrific and terrifying. It almost crossed the line into being &#34;too much&#34; (I am not a fan of torture porn horror stories), but in the end it thankfully gave us a break from that. Still, I wanted more! I wanted to know about each member of the tribe, where they came from, their history, and more stories about their murders and their victims. Aside from the baseball boy and their desire to harm Abra, however, we didn't get to know very much.<br /><br />Some people say in their reviews that they thought the True Knot members were too hammy. I disagree. I enjoyed their quips and didn't mind them being a little bit over the top sometimes. These weren't crude caricatures of villains. They had a softer side  although it was never really explored. They loved each other and sometimes tried to justify their murders by saying they have to do it to live. I would have liked learning more about them. I guess something had to be cut from this already quite lengthy novel, but I absolutely didn't find the book too long as it was at all.<br /><br />I do agree with some of the reviews that say they got tired of all the AA sayings and focus on alcohol abuse and sobriety.  Honestly, it got old. That said, I recognize this came from King's personal experience and heart, so I didn't mind it as much as I otherwise might. I just don't want to hear about it again in future King novels.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend the book without any hesitation. It isn't King's best, but in my opinion it is in his top 5. That's quite a compliment. I sincerely hope King keeps on writing these horror novels. If you're looking for a scary story, get ready for Dr. Sleep.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was one of the most \\"infinite\\" books I have ever read. The characters were so unique and I would go as far as to say that it is on ready player one status on the story telling. Over all it was an amazing book and I cannot wait to read more from the author and to see the film!<br />-Five stars<br /><br />A review by my 11 year old son.
B005LAII80|5.0|I never really cared for the 1995 version of Judge Dredd, so my expectations were pretty low.  That being said, this movie was excellent.  Great cinematography, story line, and acting.  The movie had a nice edge to it, really gritty.  I can't wait for the sequels.
B004QZ9PLU|2.0|Not one of my favorite. It is OK but I would not recommend. That is about all I can say about this book.
B009SJ3H8Q|4.0|I'm glad that I did not watch this over a span of 12 + weeks. It's better to follow this complex story in one to three sittings. Only thing wrong with doing that is that the soundtracks opening sequence gets stuck in your head and even singing &#34;John Jacob Jinglehiemer-Smith&#34; can't get that sound out of your head.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|When I set out to read this book, I had no idea of what I was getting myself into. Here I sit, wide-awake at 2:30am with a garbage can half filled with tissues. The author wrote such a wonderful story, and one that I'll be sure to inspire many more to read. Now, I just need to figure out how to get some sleep with so much of this book on my mind!
B00GLMQREE|5.0|I wanted to Give Season 3 a poke in the head and put it out of its misery. How much of the Crazy Governor were they going to force on us? How many close ups of Rick's crazy eyes? How long was the sublimely oblivious Andrea going to overlook the fact that her boyfriend was stark raving nutso?  Michone, who started out impossibly over-the-top with her matched pair of pet zombies on leashes, is much more real and interesting now. No longer acting like a rebellious 13-year-old, she still wields her katanka with amazing accuracy, but has become more three-dimensional and less of a cartoon character. She is spending most of her time with the survivors and only semi-hunting for the governor...he's not completely out of the picture although I do hope he's going to be held down to a minimum. I just wish they had not killed off Merle in Season 3. He was one of my favorite characters...what's not to like about a guy who can cut off his own limb and replace it with a swiss army arm?<br /><br />I started watching Season 4 without much hope and boy howdy, was I surprised. There's life the The Dead yet.  Episode 1 was killer. Rick regained his sanity, sort of.  His son is less psychotic. Herschell's missing leg has magically regenerated. No explanations are given, but the comic book version does mention that they find, at some point, a prosthetic limb (but it's just a leg, with no interesting accessories like Merle's replacement part). I have not read the comic version, but Amazon reviewer Brian Byrd gave me that heads up elsewhere.<br /><br />Episode 1 has several truly creepy scenese, not least of all is Rick's encounter with a young Irish lass in the forest. We also have lots of new survivors, most of them from Woodbury, home of the Crazy Governor.<br /><br />In the following episodes, a serious and highly contageous illness hits the prison compound. A high death rate and those who succumb reanimate. This does two things: it gives us a new story arc and gets rid of some of the newbies. By episode 4, we're back to our core group (mostly...heh heh). And the Zombies are rocking. More hordes and they're dangerous and frightening again. For most of Season 3, the poor Zeds were nothing more than pests. Unless you were tied to a chair and locked in a room with one, they posed no threat anymore. The survivors just swatted 'em like mosquitos. Season 4 has given them back their teeth.<br /><br />As always, the producers' ruthlessness in cutting cast members is still shaking things up. No one is Zombie-proof or bullet-proof and some of our original recipe survivors don't make it. Unfortunately Glenn is not among the victims. Sorry, but Season 3 was seriously marred by those endless \\"let's drag in the kids\\" scenes of Glen and Maggie making out.  Almost as sleep-inducing as Rick and the Governor's staring contests.  We also lose two of my favorite original survivors by the end of Season 4, one by exile and one by the governor sawing off his head. Yep, the Guv continued to make trouble in Season 4, but in a more intersting way than in Season 3. No longer \\"The Guv,\\" he wants to be known simply as \\"Brian.\\" But he's still nuttier than a fruitcake, just in a different way. I'm hoping the exiled character comes back. Not in the reanimated sense, just in the \\"Hi Honey, I'm home\\" way.<br /><br />Episode 4 is intense, exciting and gory. Everything you want from The Walking Dead.  I had to stop watching and take breaks from the action and mayhem once or twice.  The writers have really stepped things up. The Zoombas are on the march; the new characters are interesting, particularly a little girl who sometimes mistakes the Zs for pets (but not in that silly Michone way).<br /><br />Episodes 5 through 7 were just as good, and the season ender was a shocker. You have to give the writers and producers credit, they'll throw anyone to the wolves (or the zombies).  No one is guaranteed to survive until the time time. Makes for some really intense viewing.<br /><br />Let's hope next season remains reanimated or the producers will find it's their audience, not the dead, who are walking.t's hope next season remains reanimated or the producers will find it's their audience, not the dead, who are walking.
0525478817|5.0|My daughter (14) insists that I read this. She says that it is &#34;beautiful and sad, uplifting and heartbreaking&#34;... yes, those are quotes. Again, as with other books I've purchased for her, she tells me a little about the story, which I won't share for fear of spoilers, but this particular book generated a strange reaction... As she read the story over the course of the weekend, my lovely girl periodically emerged from her lair just to give me a hug, or help with dishes... I even got an unprompted &#34;I love you Mom&#34;. Her favorite new quote is from this book:<br /><br />&#34;My thoughts are stars I can't fathom into constellations.&#34;
B00FPGSPQU|1.0|This movie makes Hangover II look like a brilliant piece of comedy which it wasn.t. There is nothing funny in this entire movie. Go watch paint dry and your time will be better spent.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|The premise of the movie was good.  However, I did not like the phony accents, the fact that Will Smith got hurt so early in the movie, and the monster looked unreal.<br /><br />That was a bad scene when the daughter was killed by the monster.  It looked fake!  Even though I love Will and Jaden Smith, I didn't think this movie did them justice.

B00D2ZF3GQ|2.0|I usually don't pay much attention to critics' reviews to movies because I usually don't agree with them. \\"After Earth\\" is the exception. It feels like 100 minutes that should have been condensed into 15 minutes and inserted into a much bigger, better movie. So little happened in so much time, and we weren't given a good sense of what happened to Earth and what it was really like returning to it after everyone left. I didn't realize it before watching the movie, but as the end credits started to roll, there it was: M. Night Shyamalan. This guy hasn't written/directed/produced a decent movie since [[ASIN:B00003CXQA Unbreakable]]. It's like he used up all his good storytelling with that and [[ASIN:B00004BZIY The Sixth Sense]]. But he wasn't the only culprit. Both Will Smith and his son, Jaden Smith, did an AWFUL job of \\"acting.\\" Will was trying to be emotionless in the movie, but it just came across as really awful acting. And Jaden was barely audible, especially when being the narrator. It sounded like he was wearing braces; I couldn't understand what he was saying half the time. Not that that would have made for a better movie anyway. What a waste of time this movie was, both in the making and in the viewing.
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|Difficult to even watch.  A sign that paternalism has no place in Hollywood  I had difficulty even staying awake. Ugh
B00EY8A6BC|3.0|There are some really interesting ideas in this film, and some well-filmed sequences.  Unfortunately, there are a lot plot elements just don't make much sense and the whole film feels strangely disjointed.  It seems like the writers started with a premise and a surprise ending (not really much of a surprise), and didn't really spend a lot of time on how to get from one to the other.  The cinematography is beautiful and the actors do the best they can with a mediocre script.  Woody Harrelson is always fun to watch, and Jesse Eisenberg and the rest of the cast do try  to develop authentic relationships between their one-dimensional characters.  Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine (two exceptionally fine actors) are really pretty wasted as simple plot devices in poorly conceived, poorly written roles.  Bottom line: lots of terrific ingredients used to make a so-so dish.  It's edible as long as you don't think too hard about what you're eating.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Didn't even hear about this when it was in the theatre, and a friend mentioned it when we were talking about good &#34;sit around the house&#34; movies. I loved it so much I bought the soundtrack. Campy, funny, and of course a great ending!
B0001MDP3G|5.0|I loved this movie. I'm a huge fan of the Civil War era, its History and all things Southern.  This movie captured not only the horrors and devastation of war, but revealed the personal human sacrifices made through lost of life, home and family. Before the war, one young couple, briefly meet and, through their innocence, share a moment that becomes the heartbeat and pulse throughout this movie. After several years have passed with no word or contact, it is that &#34;one moment&#34;  that keeps (Nicole Kidman) pining away for Inman's (Jude Law) return. And It is that one moment in time, that relentlessly compels his determination to get back to her.<br />An excellent and well-written drama that takes you on an incredible journey that holds you captive until the very end.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Google support was great to handle returns.  It failed a week after receiving it.  Setup was a few minutes on our Samsung TV.  After that, it failed to load and showed a red light on the back.  We tried holding the button on it for 30 seconds, etc. but it only showed the red light.  I unplugged it, let it cool down, plugged it back in and the white light lit up with an &#34;opps, we had an error and are trying to fix it.&#34;  After that, it went red with a black screen.  The unit was only plugged in to the Samsung TV, nothing else (power came from one of the Samsung USB ports.<br /><br />The huge plus for this device is that videos from YouTube are very high resolution.  On the 60&#34; TV, I don't see low res blocks.  My six year old had fun sending her videos to the big screen, so it's easy to use when it works.  The Samsung TV already has the smart apps on it with Amazon streaming video, but this device is ten times more responsive (faster UI.)<br /><br />I'd suppose this device is Google's preemptive strike to the upcoming Apple TV products.
B000I9U9A4|4.0|I rented the movie after reading the book, which so often brings disappointment.  Not this time.  I really enjoyed the movie, and I thought Russell Crowe was quite good in the lead role.

B006WMILQU|4.0|I get tired at times of Embeth Davitz evilness and of Frances O'Connor's passivity, but they are fairly true to the novel. The male characters (Edmund and Crawford) are well played and to me, make the movie worth watching.

B008JFUUIA|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. I enjoyed it at first because it was one I could watch with my kids, nothing too bad or racy in it.  But I enjoy the songs and the romantic storyline as well.  They have grown tired of it, as kids tend to do, but I have watched it over and over to the point my kids think I'm nuts.  It's not perfectly written from a screenwriter's point of view, but it's pretty close.  There are also a few lines that more or less get thrown away because of the speed and volume at which they are said--I am the type who will rewind and even put on the subtitles for one sentence to see what I missed--but it's not a big deal.  While the cast is good, Rebel Wilson steals the show in almost every scene she is in.  Sometimes she's a little awkward, but it just adds to her character.  I also think it sends a good message to see a big girl fitting in at college, even if Wilson's humor tends to the self-deprecating (she calls herself Fat Amy, but at least she lives life on her own terms.)  I would recommend this as a family movie, and it seems the elementary age and early middle school set seem to gravitate toward it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Thanks to Amazon, we can enjoy Season 2 of this wonderful series in HD any time, at our convenience.  Thank you!
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I waited until all the noise died down to finally watch the conclusion of this Nolan trilogy.  I liked it more than expected.  I wish there had been more Catwoman scenes, as Hathaway is so sexy.  The movie is almost three hours, so you have to prepare yourself for its epic proportions.  The ending is weak but fits snugly as an end piece for the series.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|By now Supernatural fans have seen the usual monsters, demons, angels but this season we got to watch our boys fight the nastiest of nasty creatures. The interaction among the main characters (Dean, Sam, Castiel, and Bobby) is incredible. We know the good guys are going to win, in the end, but the journey is worth watching again and again.

B00A2LFXVI|4.0|I ordered the wrong item based upon a request from my future son in law. The animated story, however, is a good one.
B00DHNBPA6|3.0|The original was better. There were quite a few confusing moments in this movie that seemed to be obvious plot holes as well as parts that were just straight up not believable. I know I know, horror movies aren't known for their accuracy. Anyway as, it wasn't a bad movie but it wasn't what I was expecting.
B00F91H666|3.0|Big-budget zombie flick.  On the positive side, the zombies weren't digging themselves out of their graves.  This was more of a &#34;Resident Evil&#34; take.  The zombies moved very fast (instead of lumbering), which was also different and more threatening.  The film is quickly forgotten after viewed, which is okay since you have to go into this not expecting a heck of a lot.

006212725X|3.0|In reviewing other reviews, I noticed two others that reflected my sense of this book very clearly. \\"Too many details and not enough\\" is one terrific comment. And too little about the music of The Who. First, the good. I was touched again and again by Pete's admiration and affection for Roger Daltrey. It was quite refreshing compared to some other bands I have read about. Again and again he describes Roger as talented, caring, and a dear friend. And this book reads much the same way that Townshend speaks. If you have ever seen an interview with him, he speaks in clipped ideas, sometimes going into great detail about things that from the listener's point of view (at least, this listener), are simply not that relevant. Then in the next moment he will give a five word answer to something that should require several sentences. That is how the book comes across. We get inordinate descriptions of sound systems, and plans for plays to be written from his albums, etc. But Woodstock is mentioned in a painfully short manner. He talks about how distasteful he found the cover of \\"Who's Next,\\" but barely mentions the monumental achievement it was musically. The tragedy at Cincinnati takes about a page. He explains clearly why they chose to continue the concert, but then just brushes into the next event in his life. Keith Moon's death and memorial are mentioned....but for all of just over ONE page? Time after time I anticipated the next page as he was going to chat about a huge event in the life of The Who that I was a part of as a spectator in some way. But it would only be a sentence or two, or maybe a paragraph. Many fringe people in his life are mentioned briefly, and then brought up again on a first name basis dozens or even hundreds of pages later, and we are somehow supposed to remember who they are and what they are to him. In a nutshell, the book read more like a diary than an autobiography. But let me finish on a positive note. I am one of those readers who goes over the acknowledgements and thank-yous in a book. His were some of the more heartfelt and delightful I have read. The man is an excellent wordsmith. But this book didn't get \\"there.\\" There were some nice moments, but I was left wanting far more.
B000NY12LO|4.0|I believe this is one of the best books that I have read by Jodi Picoult.  It captures and holds your attention.  It also brings to light the seriousness of bullying and the actions that result from it.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Hilarious. I would end the review there but this thing requires a twenty word minimum so buy this book and read it!!!!!
0385743564|3.0|Brandon Sanderson's \\"Steelheart\\" is quite enjoyable, but temper your expectations. It takes place in a world where super-powered humans, termed \\"Epics\\", have essentially taken over everything (or at least the United States, we are led to believe). Unlike in comic books where the super-being populace is a mix of good and evil people, all epics in this world are basically power-hungry tyrants who want to dominate. There are no heroic Epics, we are told.<br /><br />Sanderson sets up a very interesting and elaborate world. He paints a great picture of what would happen in this kind of dystopian future, and it is compelling. Because the Epics are so stupendously powerful, governments essentially declare them \\"acts of God\\" and suggest total capitulation. After all, how can you fight a natural disaster? You can't, you just deal with it. Since most of our super-hero stories don't address these kinds of issues, I found this a fascinating approach to building a believable world.<br /><br />However, with all of its \\"believability\\" the weak point is the Epics themselves, in particular the Epic's \\"weaknesses.\\" Every Epic has one, you just have to figure it out. Some of the Epics have seemingly logical weaknesses -- an illusion-producing epic may not be able to perpetuate the illusion for an extended period of time or over great distances, for instance. Other weaknesses, though, seem completely nonsensical.<br /><br />I don't want to delve into this in depth so as not to spoil too much for the curious reader. Nonetheless, it does suggest that this is definitely more of a \\"fantasy\\" novel than science fiction. In fact, the main character in the book recalls something a non-Epic professor once said about the Epics -- that because Epics clearly defy all physical laws, the possibility that literally *anything* can happen must be left open.<br /><br />And that is ultimately what bothers me about the book. There is no sense of explanation for WHY anything is occurring at all. We lack any sort of sensible origin story outside of \\"Calamity happened.\\" There seem to be no real limitations regarding Epics in general, whether regarding their powers or weaknesses. Epics are absolutely more powerful than any super heroes or villains in, say, the Marvel or DC universes. Steelheart, it seems to me, would pretty much make Superman his chew-toy. Yet, at the same time, they could conceivably have *any* weakness regardless of how ridiculous it may seem.<br /><br />In any work of science fiction or fantasy, there has to be some fundamental sense of order to the world. Even the hints of this sense of order, namely David's meticulous notes on Epics, are not really seized upon to help you understand.<br /><br />In other words, the author seems to be leaving everything so open, so broad, so potentially bizarre, that he can use whatever plot device no matter how ludicrous and we have to swallow it. Perhaps I approached the story with wrong expectations, but this approach seemed somewhat lazy. (This is odd, given that Sanderson obviously is giving close attention to detail in other ways.) As a result, I felt somewhat unsatisfied from the climax of the book. I feel like I didn't really learn anything about Epics from the Reckoners' experiences (save one particular revelation which, frankly, kind of comes out of nowhere). The sense of \\"accomplishment\\" overall seems rather low, even though they have solved this grand tyrannical problem. It was unfortunate, to me, that the lead-up to the climax seemed quite good, with the potential to explain so much about the world, and yet have the book end as it did.<br /><br />I don't want to leave you with the impression that I truly disliked the book. On the contrary, it was very fun to read and I thought the characters were engaging. Unlike some people who didn't like the \\"failed metaphors\\" of the main character, I found it kind of endearing. That sort of language is challenging to write, and I respect what Sanderson did. Additionally, the dialogue was clever, and the action really was explosive. You won't be able to put it down for long, and that says something about Sanderson's substance and style. I commend him for good work, and hope that he can bring that sense of order to his creation in the next novel.lly, the dialogue was clever, and the action really was explosive.

B005HV6Y5W|1.0|Saw this movie in theaters a while ago and if I wasn't with friends would the walked out, or if I knew my friends hated it as much as me we would have walked out. Now it is visually good, but you can only look at a painting for so long before it gets boring. But I ended up buying it cause no one I know has seen it, no one knows my pain. So I bought it to lend it out and no joke it is on my worst movie party list, along side My Super X Girlfriend lol. Only buy it if it's cheap and you want to expirence angrey Brad Pitt, super awkward boys, and dinosaurs stepping on each other... 100% serious!<br /><br />My movie background: I love movies, there are very few I dislike, from indepentdent to block buster flops... From finding nemo....to Donnie Dario....Titanic....to Kick Ass, Notebook ... to Moon Rise Kingdom!<br /><br />So only buy this if you want a good ... Bad movie day with some good visuals, big actors, and a horrible plot, story, characters, and add just enough dinasours...

B00EDPFJA4|3.0|You may read &#34;it all flows together&#34; and think that's a good thing, but if you listen to this CD straight through you may have a hard time knowing when one song ends and the other begins. One easy example of this is Wu Tang forever into Own it. This CD is very low energy with more of an R&B feel to it in my opinion. Lots of the songs feature the same Captain save a....... music as his first CD, which plays well with the female audience. Started from the bottom and All Me (which Big Sean outshines everyone) are the high energy uptempo offering on this album. One highlight is Pound Cake feat Jay Z, which Drake uses to tow Paris Morton Music 2 which is basically a single verse of what should have been it's own interlude. I think people that enjoy a R&B CD will like this, and this would make good back ground music if you're riding in the car with your lady.

B0091XRRQC|4.0|Really enjoyed this film, personally, but my 6 and 8 year old girls missed a lot of the references. For instance, I thought having Darwin as a main character was a funny idea, but they didn't get the joke. Ultimately, they liked this movie but didn't LOVE it. Perhaps it's more for boys. However the animation is totally incredible- the Aardman team have raised the bar to a whole new level.

I liked the acting, even Tom Cruise, and Nicole Kidman is even more beautiful than I had thought. Basically the movie is enjoyment in slow motion. A fascinating sidelight: I was astonished to find it was all filmed in England. I would have sworn they filmed it in New York. It has a very &#34;New York ambience.&#34;

Overall it was well worth the effort but make sure you have a clear diary because I feel sure you will want to keep returning to find out \\"what next\\".  Pretty good read and good value.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Smart writing, different story line. Read it twice to be sure I did not miss any details. Reading second book now! Harry Potter for adults!
B0012GTZC0|4.0|This book felt slow at first and since I wasn't able to read for hours at a time when it first started, it was hard to keep up with who was who. However, once I finally had time to delve into it, I loved it!!
034580404X|5.0|Only into the first book so far, but so far OOOO  so good !!!  Can't wait to get to the other books.
B00DJYKFXG|5.0|I've been listening to this album/cd since it came out and this new edition is a revelation.  I keep hearing things I never heard before.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Kept reading it until it was done. I haven't had a book stress me out like this in a long time. Would love to actually see a TV adaptation as blasphemous as many may think.
B00136JM6S|5.0|One of my favorite all time albums!! Always enjoy listening to his music from my younger days in school. Lot's of good memories!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love it a lot I just got a new shotgun.<br />I love you so much game<br />I  i just cant stop playing you!!!!!
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|Cry of Achillies, Bleed it Dry (XXXUCKING AMAZING SONG), Lover is good.  Water Rising (Unbelievable), Fortress (Awesome)<br /><br />It takes a few listenes before it owns your soul, but it will.  Myles always get in and takes you there.  The whole band is the best thing that ever happened, and this isn't my first day.  Listening to a lot of stuff, all genres, pretend to play myself, for a very long time  Never in my wildest dreams has there been a voice like Myles and I've had that opinion of everything he's done since before Mayfield.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Great movie. I remember the situation well and knew the outcome. But, it still kept me on the edge of my seat!
0893860468|5.0|The personal differences between Ramana and Nisargadata show the irrelevance of the personality.  A street-smart, cigarette- smoking meat-eater, Nisargadata Maharaj is as profoundly aware as Ramana Maharshi and, in his own way, is Ramana's peer as a teacher.
B00AEFZ6V4|5.0|I think it's a rather good story with good actors and a well written story line.  The casting was done well.  I don't know the character in the lead role but he does a very good job with his character.  Claire Danes does a great job at being adorable, as always.  Her British accent is believable enough to a westerner. Robert DeNiro is, well, Robert DeNiro but that's how we like him.  There's a few actors from Snatch, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels which is a plus and a small appearance by Ricky Gervais as well.<br /><br />This movie would set comfortably on your shelf next to The Princess Bride without shame.
B00F35BV64|4.0|The cost to utilize the streaming-on demand feature for Star Trek Into Darkness in HD format from Amazon is ~$5.<br /><br />The cost to utilize the BlueRay format feature for Star Trek Into Darkenssfrom the local red-colored DVD kisosk is ~$1.50.<br /><br />One would think that the overhead cost to stream should be significantly less that the overhead cost to transport and store physical DVDs in a DVD kiosk.<br /><br />Yet Amazon's price-point to stream this movie in HD is more than 3x the price to rent a physical BlueRay DVD from the local red-colored DVD kiosk.<br /><br />Something seems amiss.<br /><br />Why is utilizing the streaming-on demand feature for this movie in HD format 3-times more expensive that renting a physical Blue-Ray DVD?
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I've enjoyed the previous four books in the series and this one is more of the same. He is a master at weaving the characters in and out of the story and connecting all of the threads of simultaneous events. I have the hardest time putting the book down to get anything else done and I hate for it to end!
B009PHRIEA|3.0|I don't know, I'm new to Jazz and was checking it out... it was a good deal for the five albums.
B004SEUIWO|5.0|One of the best movies ever made.  The editing was unique and engaging.  The dancing is exciting and original.  The only movie I have seen twice.
B004EPYZTE|4.0|I already reviewed this once but I must say this movie was a great take on the legend of Conan from  Birth  To King. I would recomend it to anyone who like a go  action movie with plenty of swords and fighting.<br /><br />I liked it so much I bought this one for a friends  Birthday  .
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Order arrived as intended.<br /><br />Had no issues with the package.<br /><br />If you like Harry Potter you will not be disappointed with the movies.  Definitely worth the price
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|My husband and I enjoy many old English stories shown on PBS.  We missed this movie when it was released and were happy to pick it up from Amazon.  A most enjoyable movie.
B008Y212PI|3.0|Enjoyed the game , but over too soon,  played all the different options and soon done.  I thought it would go on for longer like the first  option,  but by the last option , it had only one screen to work on .  I'm used to games that keep going on for longer periods.  Would not have downloaded if I had known in advancel
B009UNGYHG|4.0|This is a great headset - comfortable and full of features - I would prefer a little better on the noise cancelation - but over all very happy
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|Didn't expect alot because of bad box office numbers.  I was pleasantly surprised.  This is a good movie.  Not great but good.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|If You liked the first  you need to watch this one  Good cast and good story.  a must own for star trek fans.
B0012GMVVW|5.0|\\"Heathen\\" has many great tracks on it, such as \\"Cactus\\", \\"Slip Away\\", and \\"Slow Burn\\".  Even the rather slow and haunting melody of \\"5:15 The Angels Are Gone\\" is a fantastic song.  Being a huge Bowie fan as I have been for many years now, I feel that \\"Heathen\\" stands up to possibly being the best of his \\"newer\\" music.  Different, of course, to his more classic albums like \\"Space Oddity\\", \\"Hunky Dory\\", \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" and \\"Let's Dance\\", Bowie never ceases to amaze his faithful listeners and is never afraid of change.  Once again, great music from David Bowie!  (Should we expect anything less???)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game it keep you on your toes. You have to really pay attention because the piece will be looking at you and you won't even know it. Great game
B001PJRAUS|5.0|Absolutely love this story set in modern day England. Main character gets sent to Regency England to live the life of Elizabeth Bennet. What could be better?
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's cute,but not super fun. All I really like of the game is being able to name and take pictures of  my horse. I don't like it because every time I train my horse to compete, it always says that my horse is not ready and that I still need to train it.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Love the series and can't wait to own season 4. The first episode for season four was great.  Looking forward eagerly for the rest.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Great Cast good story line. I love being able to watch when I want to watch.  Some day maybe we'll be able to watch all tv shows when we want to watch without a DVR.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was my first Harlequin book.....and I loved it!! I approveThink I'm going to start reading another one tonight!!!!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I usually do not write reviews but felt like I owed one for this book. It wrenched my heart while at the same time being incredibly heartwarming. I recommend this book highly. Do yourself a favor and read it.
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|Remembered why I always loved this movie.  Great for kids and adults alike.  Humorous with just enough of a touch of danger.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a great game! Half of the time I am on the edge of my seat trying to make sure none of the prizes fall in the gutter! I always get the giant coins that come out some times. And when one of the prizes falls in the gutter I am like dang it! This is a fun and addictive game. I get so addictive I run out of the tokens in like 2 minutes and have to wait a whole day to get the 40 coins back. GET THIS APP!!!!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I have watched the web episodes and the previews to the premier.  I love the series and a Walking Dead Fan.  The first episode was a great opener.  I look forward to the new twists and turns coming up in the show.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|Hard to believe such debauchery was not only practiced but no one blinked an eye at what was going on. Very interesting even while being disgusting.
B001BANK32|5.0|If you've seen Kubrick's movie...forget all of it. Prepare yourself for an enthralling adventure through the overlook hotel like you've never imagined before...
B003R5C5JE|4.0|the box was a little crushed but the car looks very good. The doors open and it looks good in a office
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|I have continually reported issues, and have had a response plus compensation for the issues. However, the game now crashes before it even fully loads. The problems have continued and its disappointing we may have to delete a game we have spent money on and my family loves
B00ANDDBBE|5.0|Love David Tennant and Catherine Tate together!  Donna has to be one of my favorite companions.  They have great chemistry working together and would have loved to see more of them.
B007Z9QP3K|4.0|Great film. Seemed fairly realistic. Sometimes a bit contrived on the drama/timing of crises but overall worth watching. One of the best submarine movies I've seen.
0811879631|5.0|Just the neatest book ever! Couldn't put it down and will cherish it always. A near perfect copy (book-wise) and a joyful read. Some of the artwork was a real surprise too, which was great. Don't we all like that? Were I a few years younger, I'd love to work for Pixar.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Don't know what I'd do without this with my headset. They should sell them together! A must have. Love it.
B00F57VFXO|1.0|i WAS REALLY EXCITED TO SEE THIS BOOK BUT THEN i STARTED READING IT - VERY DRY, DATED AND NOT VERY SPARKLING AT ALL. WOULD RATHER RE READ ORIGINAL JAMES BOND BOOKS WHICH WOULD CERTAINLY BE DATED BUT THE ACTION WAS ALWAYS FAST AND FURIOUS!!!!!
B00COO2D6O|2.0|I loved this game played it a lot but thanks to the last update the game won't load sits on the load screen and stays there please fix it
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Works as stated. NO problems. I would suggest that you remove Alarm Clock app prior to installing this one as it is hard to tell them apart.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|Performs well but is very basic.  Cost $1 but is not the full game,  have to buy rest of levels for another dollar.  Would have preferred free app with purchasable extra levels.
B00CSYR432|5.0|I have all the Studio Ghibli movies except one. The artwork is first rate in each as are the stories. Not what most people classify as anime at all but real gems of animated movies. Disney imported most of them over the years. From Up on Poppy Hill came in independently, for some reason, but is no less a stellar effort. If you liked any of the other Studio Ghibli efforts, then get this one by all means. I guess my all time favorite is Howl's Moving Castle but nonetheless, this is tops in the list now as well.<br /><br />The English/American voice talent is first rate and does not appear to be dubbed in, matching the animation very well. Again, the artwork, detail, and story line are flawless and make every Studio Ghibli movie a special experience.
B004ADF7RO|4.0|Loved this as a kid and we watched it again recently. The movie was well done and as exciting as I remember.
B00CDV6WDS|1.0|The game is so boring and not good for cell phones. Maybe it would be better on a tablet but unless your eyesight is perfect, it's very hard to see the tiles.
B001XN9NTC|5.0|A work of art.  Really captures the life of an estranged daughter-father relationship and how difficult it is for people who age and are alone.  Captures the loneliness of older people and how they have forgotten how to connect with others.
B00C8YOIR2|4.0|Dead Medium by Peter John is a slow, meditative story exploring the choices one makes in life about who to be and how to serve through the experience of the main character, a middle aged woman named May. After a largely detached life, May dies early on in the story and the rest of the book follows her \\"life\\" as a spirit who serves others by communicating messages from the dead to the living. The story explores the purpose of life and ultimately the concept of reincarnation in unique and surprising ways. There is the feel of an aloof and observant narrator hovering about providing commentary on everyday \\"normal\\" people and revealing the details of small town life wound throughout the book which serves to illuminate the living characters.
B004CS7R70|4.0|They help my Mother see TV she has several eye problems and these glasses are one of the few things that help her to see better.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|Just loved this album. My wife to be saw him singing many of theses songs in his last concert in the States, The last song of the concert was Going Home and he told everyone how happy he was going home that night after a long World Tour. Great show and record.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|My husband and I watch this movie every year and it still scares the heck out of us. There are thousands of scary movies out there, but this is one of the scariest. It is so creepy and haunting and sad. It leaves you feeling very disturbed, yet it is still a very exciting movie to watch. We just watched it again last night and I still have chills. If you are looking for a movie to give you a good scare for Halloween, I would highly recommend this!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Not a fan of fantasy novels, I decided to read THE HUNGER GAMES only because it was so popular, and so talked about. I was hooked.  The plot moved along at a rapid pace, and I found myself totally engrossed with the character Katniss. The novel surprised me and I surprised myself.  A wonderful read.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I use this on my kindle fire. I love the app! I love how easy it is to use... however it freezes all the time and gives me the option to &quot;force close&quot; or &quot;wait&quot;... if you click wait its fine... needs an update to fix that issue. other than that I am a Pinterest junior!
1475972350|4.0|A serial killer, victims, detectives...all the elements of a good story. It is a bit gruesome for my taste in parts. In many areas the point of view jumps around and it reads a bit like a storyteller telling the story vs. showing the reader the action, yet in other places the visuals are firmly in place. The author makes a point of spreading the killers messages: Don't waste other people's time...& Time is money...messages we have heard in the real world, but probably never thought about, before now...
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great app, lots of great games to play with nice interface.<br />I really enjoy being able to play a winning hand of solitare per request. I eliminated one star due to recent addition of intrusive ads.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I have to agree with the many one and two star reviews lately. This new update is hard to read and does not have features that existed is previous versions. The new version has a way to accumulate points e wry time you access the app, but the points don't add up properly, and some of the sites you are supposed to access for points do not register or are inaccessible.  I hope some developer at TWC reads these reviews and stops these so called improvements.
B00FPH6A70|5.0|This was one of the scariest movies my husband and I have seen ever! I must have jumped out of my seat 100 times. It is so worth watching. We are very into Halloween and watch at least one scary movie a night during the month of October. This is definitely going into the rotation. Can't wait to watch it again!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I have read this book twice, and its like my favorite book ever...... Someone should make it into a movie.......
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Virtual Family is a very good games five stars out of five it teaches kids like myself how to take care of family members. It will help in the future
B00EYN3HTA|5.0|William O'Brien is a wonderful poet who paints fantasy pictures in the mind that will enchant children and adults alike. If you or your child enjoy fantasy and fairytale stories, you will enjoy this poetry. A few poems might scare very young children the way old fashioned fairy tales were meant to do. These poems should also be read aloud for the full effect. O'Brien's poetry reminds me of Alice in Wonderland and the fantastical, dark and quirky characters that lived in Wonderland.
B006MKWBW2|3.0|An ansolutely fabulous book, maybe a bit too long, but still immensly interesting. It pictures a nice environment of the 60's and the approach towards Kennedy's assassination is well built and contains a lot of tension.
B0070YDOT8|3.0|It is not as user friendly as it looks. I know there are other games on the app and they are not much better.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|I just downloaded and am experimenting with it. So far it is better than the one I previously had on my Kindle Fire HD.
B0031RSBS2|3.0|Too many meditations on road surfaces, some pretty silly Iraq war connections, and a \\"company town\\" that would have been extreme in the 1890's and looks ridiculous now.  Low-end Reacher.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I have been a Star Trek fan since before the first episode aired in 1966. I was still in high school and already a science fiction fan. I heard that the new show was coming about space travel and I was captivated by the stories, the ship and the technologies presented. Gene Rodenberry's vision was unique and very forward thinking. (My parents even liked some of the episodes.)<br />I was skeptical about buying the DVDs as I already had all of the VCR tapes of all 79 episodes and thought I did not need to duplicate them. The price for a the DVDs for a season had always been prohibitive as well.<br />I finally saw a great price on Amazon for the set of all three seasons and decided to get them. The enhanced set of DVDs is marvelous. The Enterprise (always one of my favorites spaceships) looks so much better, the planets look like planets, the special effects in general are done so well and add so much to the viewing pleasure that I cannot do anything but recommend buying the three season set.<br />I think the writing still stands even with some dated comments or ideas. This is still an iconic set to have and with the improvements it is a must-have for science fiction fans.<br />Do not hesitate; it is well worth owning.
B008G3N71W|5.0|This erotic novel has excellent writing and enjoyable story woven in such a way that each chapter stands alone while still contributing to the whole. You follow the mind of a young woman as she awakens to and explores her own sexuality in many different ways and finds a sense of her own enjoyment in her body and empowerment as a woman. There is a great variety and creativity in the story and the sensual scenes and the erotic scenes are not only well written, but hot. If you enjoy well written erotica with characters and a storyline and not just porn scenes, then this is the book for you.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|what an amazin young woman.  her bravery and and dedication to education is inspiring.  it really makes you appreciate the rights we enjoy and take for granted and it makes you want to fight for those who do not share these rights.  Malala you are my hero!
B0088W7VNG|5.0|It's too bad it had to end, I was quite enjoying these. Perhaps it'll come back in the future? (so to speak)
B00EP22QKG|4.0|You can always count on Joan Jett and The Blackhearts for some stiff lip Rock N Roll rebellion and \\"Unvarnished\\" has some of that brash Punk-Rock attitude on songs like Any Weather and Reality Mentality and Different.  These are my kind of fist pumping Rock anthems I look forward to from Jett & Co. It is interesting to hear Jett lament on life, it makes her sound mortal; I am sure that can't be right. My only complaint would be some of the songs sound over produced; I think JJ & the Blackhearts sound best when raw and unfiltered, this gets a little too polished for my liking.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I find this game to be very relaxing and fun, and especially the varies designs that you can play. It give you the best scores of others that own or have played the game. I try to get the best score but can be satisfied with the stress release from the game. I would recommend this game for any one in need of some alone time.
0783240287|5.0|Donny Osmond is the Real American Hero, right? I bought this as a gift for my mum, It definitely helped me move up to the favorite son position.
B00DZVKQGY|4.0|Like other books by Jams n Roses, this book is a dark and gut wrenching portrait, in this case of the life of a young woman as she deals with the ramifications of a childhood tragedy, the loss of her own half formed dreams, the grip of drugs and friends who use her all while not having any support or understanding from those who should have loved her. It is a stark and gripping tale written by a master of the pen.
B00632HWOG|3.0|I have only been able to view a few of the e-mails I have in my inbox.  Why is that?
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|The beginning of the story was promising, but was a disappointment in the end. I won't be reading any further books in the series.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|Like this less than I expected to. I think they were overly ambitious with this film. You can see the intent but the execution just seemed so reaching, like they tried too hard to do too much and in the end, less WOULD have been more.
B004SIP8BG|5.0|Finally found this movie (in ENGLISH)... excellent price... husband love it!!!  Extremely hard to find Jet Li movies in english for some reason.  Thanks!!!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Love this show! Great writing & dialog, awesome personas/characters, plenty of laughs, interesting character development, good cast, and usually un-formulaic plots
0307271609|5.0|I thought this was such a marvelous book. I'd recommend it wholeheartedly, except that I recognize two things: Empress Dowager Cixi was clearly written for an audience as clueless about 19th century Chinese history as myself, and was just as clearly attempting to counter a common narrative about Cixi, about which I was entirely ignorant. My feeling is that Empress Dowager Cixi is a great book; my worry is that I've been drafted as an unknowing foot-soldier in an academic battle I'm unable to evaluate properly.<br /><br />But first, oh man. I had no idea that China had been ruled by a woman for the latter half of the 19th century, and the story of her rise-even more, of her rule-is incredible. Surprising, inspiring, impressive...also sad, at times.<br /><br />If I'd thought for very long before requesting the book I might have put two and two together, but this is not a cheerful period in Chinese history. If Cixi accomplished anything, it was a form of emergency triage-she arrived at the Forbidden City in 1852, during a period when China's isolationism had left it vulnerable to European powers with imperial ambitions. China, and Cixi when she held power, struggled to catch up, struggled to remain independent, struggled against the erosion of her borders as foreigners nibbled away at ports and peninsulas.<br /><br />But China didn't fall. It never became a puppet. Despite military incursions by Britain, Germany, France and Japan, despite the fact that China lost most of the wars it fought during this time, the country survived. And, the author of Empress Dowager Cixi argues, much of the credit for China's survival, and for the positive changes made in the country during this time, should be credited to Cixi.<br /><br />Of course, those changes are themselves depressing. Cixi's triumphs include things like building railroads and telegraph lines, founding Western-style universities, fostering a free press, sending ambassadors abroad. A lot of these changes amount to: admitting that the old ways are wrong and aping the West. It's hard to argue against the necessity of modernization, but equally hard to deny the loss of pride and identity that went along with it.<br /><br />So this was a rough period for a great empire. And Cixi's greatness-the book convinced me of it; she was clever, determined, far-sighted, reasonable, hard-working, fierce-has been stuck under the shadow of hard times. But she executed some truly astonishing political maneuvers, and if you appreciate savagely intricate court politics, this book is worth reading on that count alone.<br /><br />For example-this is my favorite, it made me gasp aloud as I read-Cixi had a nemesis. A man, Prince Chun, who opposed her policies, particularly her interest in the West, and expressed his displeasure at one point by arranging to have Cixi's dearest friend executed. A pretty strong warning, you might say.<br /><br />But Cixi won the day.<br /><br />How? After her own son, the Emperor, died, Cixi had to name a new heir. She picked Chun's only son. The three-year-old boy was taken from his home to be raised by Cixi. Neither Chun nor the boy's mother had further access to the boy. What's more, Chun couldn't protest-Cixi had paid him a great compliment, hadn't she? And he also had to withdraw from politics (a son must be obedient to a father, but an Emperor cannot be obedient to anyone, so the father couldn't disrupt the court with his presence), thus clearing the way for Cixi to rule unimpeded.<br /><br />Vicious, right? Vicious, bloodless, brilliant. This woman could scheme.<br /><br />But Cixi's loyalty and friendship was just as remarkable. For example-Cixi had been a concubine of fairly low standing before she bore her husband his first and only son. She wasn't very popular with the Emperor, and she wasn't officially the mother of her own child. The Emperor's wife, Zhen, was.<br /><br />You'd think that Cixi and Zhen would be at one another's throats, wouldn't you? I expecteda rivalry, a catfight, maybe some poison. No. Not at all. Cixi and Zhen were friends and allies. They executed the coup that first brought Cixi to power, as Regent until her son came of age, together, and ruled in tandem until Zhen's death. They made a great team, stronger together than apart.<br /><br />If there's one thing I love more than the story of a woman triumphing over all the odds and gaining power, it's the story of a pair of good friends who triumph over all the odds and gain power.<br /><br />There were other aspects of Cixi's biography that surprised me. How willingly and completely she withdrew from the throne when her son came of age. The second time around-after her son died, and the little heir she'd stolen from Chun came of age-things didn't go nearly so well. But that first time, after ruling for ten years, after discovering that she liked having power and had even grown popular, she gave it all up.<br /><br />Empress Dowager Cixi is beautifully written. I started the book with no background knowledge at all, but I followed along easily. Chang fills in details and supplies background as needed, and has the gift of being comprehensive without becoming condescending. She paints a vivid picture of everything from the dust in the roads to the jeweled finger-protectors that Cixi wore.<br /><br />That being said, it became increasingly clear as I read that Chang was attempting a rehabilitation. Apparently Cixi has been either dismissed or vilified by most historians, her accomplishments attributed to her male courtiers, her cruelties highlighted and exaggerated. Chang struck me as careful and thorough, but also very partial. And I'm in no position to judge.<br /><br />Except that it was such a good, satisfying read.

B00AFCEIB0|5.0|This is a very helpful tool and has come in handy for me when I was not in the room with the computer
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I love this game. Very addictive but so much fun. I only wish it had a way of starting over from the beginning with no stars so that each time I get to the last game I can immediately start over. But still a great game.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|It was a good Saturday night popcorn movie. I was surprised how low critics rated it, but saw that the general population liked it, and so did my husband and I. Twist ending too, which, of course, makes you want to watch it again. Enjoy!
B006O5Y75Y|3.0|got this great movie via Amazon Prime streaming. HD was a dollar more.  Watch films on regular basis via streaming from amazon and NetFlix. Almost everything I've seen for nearly free was better quality. Looked like we were playing on a VHS machine rather than HD streaming.

0316017930|5.0|Having read and enjoyed &#34;Blink&#34; and &#34;The Tipping Point&#34;, it was natural that I would read this as well.  I imagine this would be great for anyone with children, not just Canadians.<br /><br />This book explores the things that make people stand out two standard deviations or more from the mean: timing, natural ability, practice, and luck.<br /><br />Didn't explain why I'm still a loser, though.  My birthday is in January!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|An awesome, action packed sequel! We have watched it several times already. Can't wait for the next one! It would be very difficult to pick a favorite character. Kahn is great!

B00F7YHDWC|4.0|it would be so cool if u could see yourself dying and pick ur own character...just saying...it would be cool...
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|I liked this better than I expected to. Cast does a good job, but the set effects overshadow everything. Eye candy! Pretty much everyone who has an 8th grade education will recognize the story, but they still do it well and engaging.
B000FC10MU|2.0|This is the kind of book that is usually right up my alley as I am a reader of fantasy and mythology... but not this time.<br />I think the main problem is that Gaiman slowly (very slowly)lets you know that he can kill anyone off and then bring them back through some loop hole of the internal logic as long as he feels like writing it that way. Therefore death means nothing to ANY of the characters.  This eliminates any type of concern you may have for the characters involved, none of whom are likable anyway.  By the end whether anyone lives or \\"dies\\" just doesn't matter so I was left not caring about how it ended.<br />It was a real drag finishing this book and waiting for something to happen, but nothing ever does.

B0001ARCFA|5.0|I'm just a novice but i know these phones are great. I've had mine for about 3 years. crank my amp up 6-8 and the phones are clear as a bell.  Unscrew the Gold Plated jack and you are good to go with smaller devices, although, with my samsung phone wasn't anything like the amp hookup.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I'm that guy.  I heard about Adkins and Paleo diets and dismissed them as hippy crap.  Then, someone goes out and uses science to make me look stupid.  Sigh.  Oh well, the truth is that we all make mistakes, including scientists and nutricianists.  Read this book.  You'll be bombarded with scientific proof that carbs cause fat.
1592402038|5.0|I wholeheartedly recommend this book for everyone to read, especially persons for whom writing is an essential part of their everyday existence. Far too often I have seen punctuation errors similar to those outlined in the book and reading this book will help anyone to communicate their thoughts and ideas with proper and meaningful punctuation.

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Parts of this book were captivating to the point that I didn't want to put it down, but some of it was luke-warm and the story dragged.  There are two subplots going on, one with major players Will, Tess and Felicity; the other with Cecilia and John-Paul.  In the former, there is a love-triangle where husband Will has admitted falling in love to the reciprocating Felicity, and Will's wife Tess simply stews about it at best.  I couldn't understand the lack of fury or action that she displayed - the book is Australian, perhaps sexism and accepting of one's spouse as a cheat are more customary in this culture?  The second dynamic involves Cecilia reading a letter she was intended to receive in the event of husband John-Paul's death, written by John Paul.  She decides to read it (spoiler alert) finding that he has admitted to killing a teen girl when he was also a teen - a killing which has never been solved.<br /><br />The story has a back-and-forth of What if I told?  What if I don't tell? mixed with a grieving mother of a girl who would now be in her 40s if she were alive.  The mother, Rachel, recently discovers information which leads her to believe that a boy her daughter dated, Connor, is responsible.  Anger and hatred eat at Rachel until she attempts to take this man's life and instead a terrible tragedy occurs...which in some way brings a weird redemption to John-Paul.<br /><br />The ending of the story was good;  it was like something I had never read before.  The author discusses the fate each person in the story was destined to have, and how things were meant to turn out a different way than they did.<br /><br />At the end however I was left wondering why the subplot with Will, Tess, and Felicity even existed in the story.  Their lives did at times overlap with the main plot, but why the large issue of infidelity when it didn't play a part in the outcome of the story?
B00B6QXN56|5.0|I saw this performance on television.  I am more of a Springsteen kind of girl,but I really enjoyed this cd.  Beautiful old and unusual instruments used, great acoustics.  One of y new favorites
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is fun but I wish some of the in game items weren't so much. Otherwise it is a great way to pass the time. The graphics are pretty good, too.
B00F5BON8O|5.0|My music tastes have been changing over the last year or two.  Right now, Sarah Jarosz is a top center artist for me because of the smooth music she uses with her story telling lyrics.  This album just fits perfectly with her previous work.  I have to be careful with my limited &#34;music&#34; money, so this latest work of hers was quickly scooped up by me.  If you enjoy mellow music, then this CD should fit right in.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|I would've settled for just a collection of puzzles, but they had to make it super fancy with fancy graphics and a &#34;plot line&#34;. The puzzles are fun and sometimes challenging (mostly not), but the game is rather bloated with &#34;story&#34; and graphics.

1846615798|5.0|TO NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN DISCIPLINARY AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />A startling number of high profile regulatory issues have appeared on the horizon fairly recently, all widely reported in the press.  The banking crisis comes readily to mind; ditto the Libor fixing crisis and the worrying revelations surrounding the supervision of care homes.<br /><br />Correspondingly, a number of quite radical changes have merged within the regulatory environment, pertaining mainly to the legal, medical and financial services professions. All of which should indicate why this highly regarded and well established text from Jordans, now in its seventh edition, contains much new material.  As Jordans point out, ‘the regulatory arrangements of most of the important statutory regulators have undergone a massive restructuring in Parliament’.<br /><br />New to this edition therefore, are a large number of pivotal cases: for example -- Bonhoeffer v GMC… Baxendale-Walker v Middleton & Ors… Mattu v University Hospital Coventry & Warwickshire… and of course, many more.<br /><br />The objective of the book, in the words of the authors, is ‘to provide the reader with a clear overview of the new regulatory architecture so as to enable them better to apply the core legal principles governing disciplinary and regulatory proceedings’.  Hard pressed practitioners will certainly applaud the authors’ overall aim of making this complex subject as accessible as possible.<br /><br />Part I of the book, which includes the first ten chapters, aims to lead you logically through the disciplinary/regulatory process.  The composition of the tribunal is described, followed by the conduct of the hearing, plus the possible disciplinary sanctions.<br /><br />Part II provides practical advice to prosecuting and defence advocates, not to mention those subject to the scrutiny of the disciplinary hearing. Note the sections on, for example, ‘clarity of language’… ‘avoiding confrontation’… and ‘speeding things up.’<br /><br />Usefully, the following chapter gives examples of disciplinary arrangements in some of the most prominent regulatory and professional bodies, from the Architects Registration Board to the GMC, to the Rugby Football Union.<br /><br />A notable feature of the book if you’re pressed for time, is the full table of contents at the beginning and detailed index at the end.  As you would expect, there are some fifty pages of tables of cases, statutes, statutory instruments, European materials and a table of abbreviations. The appendix contains the text of the Human Rights Act 1998, notably those sections relevant to this area of law.<br /><br />The publication date is cited as at December 2012. The authors’ website provides cases and legislation that have taken place after that date.  Together with its accompanying website, the book is an indispensable resource for practitioners involved in any way with disciplinary and/or regulatory proceedings.aring.

B00A6CCF0K|4.0|The Shining may very well be the greatest horror story ever written, the writing was superb, the characters and plot were terrific, and it was genuinely scary.  Dr. Sleep, not so much. While it was great to meet Danny Torrence again, most of the secondary characters were less than compelling, especially the villians. They just were not all that scary, and their silly names like Rose the Hat and Barry the Chink just made matters worse.  I wouldn't say it is a bad book, but it does not come close to living up to The Shining.  King's other book that was published this year, Joyland, is far superior in my opinion.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Only thing missing in this delivery was a bucket of popcorn to sit through all 8 releases!<br /><br />Now my kids want a Harry Potter wand, flying broomsticks and cars.  I think a trip to Universal Studios Orlando is in our future.<br /><br />Thanks for delivering a great collection my kids will enjoy for some time.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|Very interestingly written.  Unfortunately, his authoritative tone hides his VERY loose use of the facts.  He chooses his Bible quotes to fit his theory, pretending the ones that don't fit are nonhistorical.  ANY book that purports to say &#34;no one can know the true historical Jesus, but I will tell you who he was&#34; has got to be bogus.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|It's like  Grey's Anatomy for lawyers.  It's very fast-paced, yet easy to follow.  The characters are very 3-dimensional and well, real.  I love the ambiguity in the portrayal of a corporate lawyer's duties.
B00F35BV64|4.0|I must admit I'm still a fan of the original Star Trek series.  Maybe I'm seeing things through rose colored glasses as I haven't gone back and watched any of the original episodes.  Having said that, the characters of James Kirk and Spock seem to be lacking something.  However, this movie has one of the best villans ever.  When he shows up, the movie takes off.  Good special effects (of course) but a much more engaging plot and thus a 4 star rating.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|This was a huge disappointment for me. As much as I love Neil Gaiman's writing, this book just didn't do it for me. There were some notably scary moments, and those scenes were gripping and interesting, but as a whole the book failed to draw me in. At the end, I found myself staring at the cover, wondering what the point was. It might be worth pointing out that this was a book club pick for my reading group, and the feeling was unanimous. Wish I had more positive comments to make about it, as I am a fan of Mr. Gaiman's writing.
B00D1DBO1C|2.0|Iit work ok would like it to match up with all the rest of my accounts and also my address book

B00F52YOPA|2.0|Loved playing hidden games and this one is no exception to my liking, but the game would have been great if it haven't stop loading. I was stacked at level 89. It just keeps on loading, with sounds but no graphics displayed even if I played it over again. How can I enjoy the game best if it does not show another level? I have paid a few bucks for this game but I don't think it's worth it. My niece also loved the game but she complained it loads too slow specially if your above level 50. Can you please do something about this? Maybe next time when the problem is fixed, I would rate this higher.
B001TH16DI|4.0|Movies are still great, just wish they had tried to modify some of the visual effects to bring them more up to date, but otherwise great as far as sound and clarity go.
1781162646|5.0|This was a pleasant escape for 2 days, had trouble putting down the book, the story was captivating and the characters were people you came to care about. The story is told in the present, so it's a flashback to the protagonist's summer job at age 21 (1973).  King weaves the story from commentary from the present to surprisingly details so fresh and real, you forget Jonesy is writing this in 2013. It feels like 1973! In fact I had to glance at the copywright date to be sure King released this book this year.<br /><br />Read it today, you won't be sorry. Not bloody, or gory but a great story nonetheless.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|With a little patience you can obtain a pretty good deck for free, which is a bit of a surprise from a Gameloft game. Of course paying cash will speed up the process, but with this being a free game that is to be expected. Highly recommend giving it<br />a shot!

B008XG1X18|4.0|Usually this is my favorite social networking app, but the update has created several problems on my Kindle Fire HD. It won't let me view oversize pins at all, and it won't let me view YouTube videos; also, there is often a glitch which causes all the pins to disappear and I have to close the app and pull it up again to make it work. This happens several times a day. Please fix this as soon as possible.
B0025KW29U|5.0|You'll laugh, you'll cry, and then you'll rewatch it with commentary and do it all over again. It's an all-around good time.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|This excellent book helps the reader understand the acrimony with which Americans debated whether<br />to involve the United States in the Second World War. The narrative is compelling and sheds new light<br />on the most bitter American political debate of the twentieth century.
B00B7NPRY8|4.0|Enjoyed re-reading Dune, have always liked Sci-Fi, and this was able to pull me back into its action. In some ways it calls to mind current political intrigues and is worrisome.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I will admit, when I first started Tangled I couldn't stand Drew. I almost didn't finish the book because of it. He is just an incredibly self-centered guy. But, the more I read, the more he grew on me. I came to really love him and his thought processes. This is a must read for anyone who likes a good love story. Because all of us deserve to find true happiness, even the egotistical, self-centered people.
1932100660|5.0|Very informative unbiased, tells the diet situation like it is, tremendous amount of research in this book, exposes misleading information from 'official sources'

B008TRUDAS|3.0|Yes the story was good, but was lacking for me. Furthermore the story was listed under possessive alpha males. This was not the case. This story is just a rated PG or G. So if you are looking for something more steamy, this is not it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome but it needs lot more like food tools and all kinds of stuff and so that's it
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I READ THE BOOK AND THE 2 FOLLOW UP BOOKS AND THEY WERE GREAT.  I BELIEVE THAT IF YOU READ THE BOOK FIRST AND THEN SAW THE FILM IT WOULD MAKE A LOT MORE SENSE.<br />THAT BEING SAID, THEY PICKED ALL OF THE RIGHT ACTORS TO PORTRAY WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE FILM AND WOODY HARRELSON WAS GREAT, AS HE ALWAYS IS, NO MATTER WHAT.<br />BIZARRE, NOT FOR EVERYONE AND YET SHOWS THE TENACITY AND COURAGE OF A YOUNG WOMAN WITH ALL OF THE ODDS AGAINST HER AND YET SHE NEVER GAVE UP.
B00F5BON8O|5.0|Sarah and her team have created a pure joy to listen to in Build me up from Bones.  Every song is a pleasure, but Miles on the Moon is not to be missed.  The song is layered like an evocative dream that your ears never want to wake up from.

B002NANLCE|5.0|Lots of science.  I recently watched the series on ABC.  It led me to the book.which is vastly different but so enjoyable.  The book provided more details and I found it easy to follow,
B0091REZMW|4.0|Wonderful seek and find game...I like the idea of exploring a mansion...makes me think of clue. The major problem with this game is the rate that consumes energy. That being said, it does seem worth it to wait for energy to reload.
B000M9BPEY|3.0|The dvd does not play correctly. It will grind and stop and start again.  Once during the movie the dvd went back to the menu on its own.  We thought it may be our blu-ray player so we took it to our bedroom and the kitchen players.  Same thing.<br />Must have had a scratch or something on it.  For the price, I expected perfect!  I gave it away at a fall bizarre.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I dont usually read what one would call &#34;historical&#34; fiction.  But this was just wonderful.  It was clearly incredible storytelling that made you feel as if the characters were a part of your life and someone you knew personally which is why you just couldnt stop reading.  A fantastic read....so sad when it ended!!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|The calculator only works in portrait, which is a little inconvenient, but the app is free and it calculates, so it serves the purpose.  If you need a basic calculator, grab this one.  If you need more functionality, check out other apps.  Otherwise, you'll be just fine.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is one of my favorite books for a lot of reasons, one being the excitement of the book. The plot is one of the best plots of any book. It keeps you on the edge of your seat when your reading it. The plot is so good it will make you not want to stop reading the book. It could change from slow and calm to fast and exciting in the matter of pages. At the end of almost every chapter there is a huge cliffhanger that makes you want to keep reading to find out what is happening next. In other words, it keeps you guessing. The plot of The Hunger Games is not only excited but dramatic too. The chose of words that Suzanne Collins uses makes the book just that much better. When I was reading it, all throughout the book I could easily picture what Suzanne Collins was saying, thats how descriptive and well written this book is.<br /><br />  I would recommend this book to everyone. I think it is a great book for anyone, whether you are a romance, excitement, action, or adventure lover, this book is for you. It has everything! That is what makes this book so amazing, the different kind of variety and genres it contains. The Hunger Games is just like any romance book, there is love and broken hearts, people risking their life for each other, and many other reasons. Besides all the romance it is very exciting and action and adventure filled. People fighting to the death for others amusement, some rebelling moves, sacrifice, and many other exciting and action-packed parts.  Although this book may contain violence, I think it is suitable for many ages. Suzanne Collins is very descriptive in this book and it is very easy to follow along.
B0080TBS40|5.0|The closing curtain on the Black Crowes' career in 2009 was the gilt-edged Before the Frost.....Until the Freeze, recorded live in upstate New York at one of Levon Helm's Midnight Rambles.  Though coming three years later, and after a year of touring and a few personnel changes, Big Moon Ritual expands on that familial and bohemian vibe,  channeling that free form spirit from live performance to studio recording with little lost in the translation.  That spirit is reflected in seemingly endless though seldom tiring songs, and carries with it a tour-weary, weight-of-the-world bearing can't-wait-to-get-into-the-studio energy. That all adds up to a record that is, for lack of a better phrase, a total jam, one that rarely dips beneath grandiose.  For the most part, Big Moon Ritual by the Chris Robinson Brotherhood is simply brilliant. --- Michael Canter - Jivewired
B002ZG97EC|5.0|The seller described this product well! The blu-ray/dvd arrived very quickly and in great shape.<br />Great packaging and great seller to work with!<br />No issues on this sale!<br /><br />Wonderfully funny show! A must see ~ The Nieces and Nephew and I laughed till we hurt!
B008M721MS|1.0|I was led to believe that this software would work with my Kindle fire 2nd generation, But I couldnt get it to work. Further research on the computer revealed that skype is not compatible with my Kindle. ( Although it is with other Kindles and it comes preloaded with those), I was really disappointed to say the least as Skype is a fantastic product that I use on my desktop. Hence the reason why I gave it the lowest score as it doesnt work with my machine. Never mind.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|There are some videos I can access on YouTube that do not show up on vTube for whatever reason.  I am not sure if it is because this version is free, but it is only inconvenient at times - typical limitations experienced with Kindle-Android apps.  I may purchase the pro version at some point, but I'm not convinced it will be worth it as of yet.  Otherwise, a good app.

B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I am not sure whether or not people who can't actually remember the JFK assassination -- and what it did to our world at the time -- will enjoy this book as much as I did.  I think Stephen King did a fabulous job of re-creating that time period.  The writer reminds us of a different world than we live in today -- and maybe sometimes we'd all like to go back in time!<br />I bet it was fun and a challenge to write -- and think about the things you couldn't include because they didn't exist in that time frame!<br />Although I have no interest in horror type novels, this will encourage me to perhaps give other Stephen King books a try.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Adobe has its good and bad points, but this app is really great if you don't need to do a lot of stuff with pdfs.  You can do most of the basic commenting actions - notes, highlights, etc.  Also, the documents are easy to read and zoom in/out.  It is very helpful if you save docs to Adobe.com.  If you are looking for a great deal more out of the functions for pdf docs, you may want to look at other apps.  Otherwise, this is very good.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Great<br /><br />My favorite part was the timing of the telling of the secret.<br /><br />Real life decisions thought thru. Great read!

0142418471|4.0|The story Will Grayson Will Grayson is a teen drama about two boys with the same name, Will Grayson. One boy struggles with his best friend Tiny who is trying to produce a play Will does not approve of. The other boy is fighting depression and has one internet friend, who is not who they seem. In this story their lives cross and happen to help solve each others problems.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a detailed read that puts you in the hearts of the characters. For example, you truly feel the pain of Will Grayson when he expresses his sadness for the term of events. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone under 13 because it has crude language and has topics that are not appropriate for young children. I enjoyed this book because each chapter brought a new idea that made it difficult for me to put down. You will truly enjoy John Green and David Levithan (the authors) work because it was easy to relate to and will touch your heart.

1455502626|4.0|In 'Plum Island,' Nelson DeMille introduces his readers to John Corey, NYPD homicide policeman. Others in the Corey series (in rough chronological order) are 'The Lion's Game,' 'Night Fall,' 'Wild Fire,' and 'The Lion.' With Corey, DeMille follows in the tradition of Michael Connelly (Harry Bosch) and Lee Child (Jack Reacher) in creating an archetypal 'hero' that pulls the reader in. It's a winning formula for the authors-- if you like one Harry Bosch novel, you'll probably buy others in the series. Same recipe with John Corey.<br />As other reviewers have noted, 'Plum Island' is not just a superficial police procedural; DeMille's strengths as a novelist, on display here and in his other novels, is character development and the prodigious research that underlies developing the 'setting' of the novel. Who knew eastern Long Island has such a fascinating history?<br />Two things detract from Plum Island, and, to a lesser extent, in the other novels in the Corey series. One, DeMille always throws in one or two gratuitous sex scenes, with (of course) Corey in the male role. This really adds nothing to the development of the plot, and, in one sense, objectifies the women involved, who otherwise come across as professional characters.<br />Second, Corey is a wisecracking smart-aleck, the type of individual one would find fairly obnoxious in the real world. The humor embedded in the Corey character certainly adds to the enjoyment of 'Plum Island.' One wishes that DeMille had toned down the constant Corey badinage.

B003YL4L0W|5.0|Very interesting read. Lots of social issues to dive into. Did not like the ending too much situational irony in my opinion. Fast read
B007MDB71O|5.0|I read all the books as a kid, and loved this movie!  Hoping the make more in the series soon!!
B001GZ6QEC|2.0|I am movie correcter  and I chose my movies very fearfully, after we saw the movie in the theater then  me and my husband decide to add this movie to our collection . I always buy  movies from Amazon but  this time the sound  is very bad unfortunately and I need another movies but how can I buy other movies if I don't know how is the quality  that is way I stop buy movies from online.
630512762X|5.0|If you are a Cage or Travolta fan this is a must see classic. I've been watching this movie since I was a kid and it never gets old
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I love this game it is great and it has more characters to play as. I'm going to enjoy this game
B00006RAKP|5.0|Elton John has always had such a creative mind this is his best of the best!  I keep it in my car so I can listen when I am in a mood for his music.
B00138J1Z8|5.0|And to think he does NOT use a pick to produce these sounds Imogen Heap is<br />a plus as well.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The horses look real. The action looks like a real horse. All and all a great looking game. Horse lover's should try this game.
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|I tend to analyze movie details/probability/plot etc. and as such this is not a good movie for someone like me to watch.  I spent most of the movie thinking about all that was technically wrong with it (there are numerous examples - and this is random - 7 hour flight and the passengers sit in chairs up against a wall that don't recline, no inflight entertainment, they just sit and stare at the opposite wall).  But then I realized that there wasn't a likable character (although there really aren't any other than Will and Jaden after the first 15 minutes or so except for occasional flash backs) so even if the technical problems didn't exist it still would have been bad.<br /><br />Jaden's character (the main character and the one you're supposed to be rooting for) is a mess.  Yearns to be a Ranger like his officer father but can't follow orders, lies, acts impulsively, and apparently has no technical education.  But none of those are portrayed as character flaws - just a boy trying to prove himself to his father.<br /><br />Hmmm...  I guess I could go on but most everything has been said in other reviews..  So to recap this and those;<br /><br />Cons<br />Bad Acting<br />Unlikeable characters<br />Technically flawed<br /><br />Pros<br />Decent special effects/CGI<br />Good cinema photography<br /><br />Watch only if free - and then at your own risk depending on your likelihood of analyzing.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|The last time I had this music it was on a cassette...it has always been a favorite and so bought the CD (finally).  Now I'm dancing in the car!
B007B5EDEG|5.0|Great price for all five books!! I really love George R.R. Martin. His writing is incredible, definitely in a league of his own. Can't wait for him to write the rest of it. Five stars, no question!!
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Loved watching the whole season non-stop. Great series. DVD quality was great and the packaging was awesome! Very good buy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is the best game ever I never thought the minions get a spotlight game it is just so awesome.
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|This book came highly recommended to me from several people, so maybe it was just over-hyped. In places, it struck me as Nicholas Sparks with more highbrow references. The story is engaging, but it feels like typical YA fiction. To me, it wasn't a very successful crossover for adult audiences, but maybe that just isn't what John Green was trying to write.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|I read Speaker for the Dead right after Ender's Game and I guess I was expecting more action and adventure. In retrospect, I think it makes sense, though, that Speaker is more mature and introspective since Ender is older himself. I found the themes interesting and thought-provoking and I was genuinely engrossed in the mystery. I liked that there was wisdom behind all of Ender's words and actions.<br /><br />The reasons for my four star rating rather than five are mostly aesthetic--I found it clunky to teach myself some basic Portuguese in order to say the characters' names correctly and understand what they said in the absence of translations. I got to really leverage my Kindle, though, and use the translation feature, which didn't take as long as looking these up elsewhere. Also, I couldn't shake the feeling that referring to the alien race as \\"piggies\\" was derogatory and offensive, even though the characters--both human and alien--didn't seem to mind.<br /><br />One final thing I couldn't shake since I'm a long-time Star Trek fan, is that the whole premise is a case study in the dangers of violating the Prime Directive. I know, they violated it all the time in Trek, but in this universe the rules are much more lax.
B005HI4LLY|5.0|Not necessarily a must buy, but definately a must see. A word of mouth movie working it's way up to cult classic status
B0091REZMW|3.0|I really enjoy the game. My complaint is that it runs slow and locks up on my kindle fire hd.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|Loved watching the whole season non-stop. Great series. DVD quality was great and the packaging was awesome! Very good buy.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|Didn't like this movie too much. I love the actors, but darn the story was hard to follow and understand why we are here to watch this. Defintely Si-Fi, that's for sure. If you like off the wall crazy un-understandable movies, then you'll love this.
B00594XOZU|1.0|Always havin errors n its gettin on my last nerve. my email getting bombed with stuff about how my friends have been tryin to reach me -.-
0979019710|5.0|The Miracle Morning will inspire and instruct you in how to do the thing you've been told to do to increase your productivity and success, get up early. An easy to replicate schedule will help you get started. Not that it's always easy and the book explains that as well. But it's doable and you will be rewarded!
B003JUGQ38|5.0|There are not enough adjectives to describe David Tennant as Dr. Who.  He was just rockin' and this season was more of the same.  LOVE DR. WHO!
1601251505|2.0|My Book came arrived quickly and all was well. That is until I realized too late that it was missing pages 481-512. Now I am outside of the return window and have a defective book. These pages weren't immediately noticed because they aren't cut or torn out they were simply left out during the binding process. The book is helpful but the missing pages are inexcusable.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|Loved watching the whole season non-stop. Great series. DVD quality was great and the packaging was awesome! Very good buy.
B00F35BV64|3.0|I liked the first Star Trek Much better than this one. But, it was nice to see the characters get going in something new. I recommend you check it out once, but you'll probably never watch it again or at-least for a couple of years.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love this app easy to use and you can get to very fast it's so good people should get if they have a kindle
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|Way better than the original release. Some dud's on here but overall this is a rare gem.<br />Must have for any Dylan fan.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Enjoyed learning about all the investigations a lawyer does before going to court.  Alicia character is fun to watch played by Juliana M.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|I find that upon watching one episode that I cannot stop with one.  I continue watching 2 or 3 more.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|Loved watching the whole season non-stop. Great series. DVD quality was great and the packaging was awesome! Very good buy.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|I liked it, it was a one of a kind movie that's for sure. Same kind of story, but good points of view. I liked how we got to see things from different places in the world. I recommend you check it out at-least once.
B005ZUR724|5.0|I think this game is help full cause it requires strategies to win<br />I've been having fun for the past 2 years I've been playing .
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Once again a great ghost story. The fact Dannys still around means one more book! Right?! If you haven't  read The Shining I think you read that first.
B008JFUNNM|4.0|\\"It was supposed to be easy. I take over ship, get paid, no one gets hurt.\\" In 2009 a Somali named Muse (Abdi) is in trouble and needs to get money for his boss fast or face the consequences. His plan is to hijack a cargo ship and hold it ransom until he gets his money. When he boards a ship captained by Rich Phillips (Hanks) he thinks he found his answer to his problems, but things only get worse for all involved. This is a true story. It's always more fun to watch a movie that is also a true story and even better when you see one that you remember the events when it was happening. As far as the movie goes it starts off pretty slow but grows more and more tense as it goes on. As good an actor as Tom Hanks is I found myself thinking that this is really a part that many people could pull off. Then I watched the last 20 minutes and realized why they got Hanks. Much like the movie Apollo 13, when you watch a movie that you know how it ends but still end up shedding a tear it is because of great filmmmaking. This falls into that category. A movie that builds momentum the entire time. Starts off slow but by the end you are hoping for more. I liked it. Overall, tense and makes you think about both sides of the event and if the pirates were really evil or not. I give it a B+.
B00CWV8X04|2.0|This movie was a little weird.....we didn't even watch it all.  So I can't give it a very good recommendation.
B00915G6SU|5.0|Loved watching the whole season non-stop. Great series. DVD quality was great and the packaging was awesome! Very good buy.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|I liked this one ok, it took forever to understand what and where we are in the movie. but after it got going it get's better. TONS of shooting and killing, but I must say I liked the other Die Hards much better.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Cool game Spiderman is the best game ever in the whole wild world of ever it is very cool and amazing<br />I love it and awesome and excellent and Spiderman is really cool
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|tried to install five times still says I'm low on data when I get rid of almost all my apps
B00E3IZIM0|2.0|\\"There are things you can't fight - acts of God. You see a hurricane coming, you get out of the way. But when you're in a Jaeger, you can finally fight the hurricane. You can win.\\" In the not too distant future an alien race called Kaiju arrive and begin to take over the world. To fight back humans invent giant robots called Jaeger's. After a mishap the Jaeger program is discontinued. When it turns out that the only way to stop the Kaiju is to bring back the Jaeger's, a former pilot (Hunnam) once again has a chance to save the world. Before I start I will say that I was not looking forward to seeing this at all. I am a sci-fi fan but this looked slow and boring. That said I will say this was pretty much what I expected. The effects were cool looking but this is really an un-original mix of Armegeddon, Real Steel, Independence Day (complete with a speech) and Voltron. All of which on their own are better then this movie. Also as a side note my 14 year old son was not impressed either. Overall, many people may like this but I found it way to generic and boring to stay interested in the whole time. I give it a C.
B001B2CPH2|5.0|This is an old movie.... but a classic.  Enjoyed watching it again after so many years.  Good good good good.
B003L77G8I|5.0|Loved watching the whole season non-stop. Great series. DVD quality was great and the packaging was awesome! Very good buy.
B0011EU0NG|4.0|A great movie for road trips.  My kids discovered when they were 5 and 7 and they still enjoy many years later!
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Downton Abbey is SO well done...I love historical fiction, and it just does not get any better than this!...the period of history, the characters, the story line, the location, and the fashions, all come together to create a perfect getaway into another time and world.  I have never heard anyone say they didn't love it...so if you have not seen it, I couldn't recommend it any higher...ENJOY!!!
B004U8VX2M|5.0|Fresh,  timely and entertaining.  Strong character development and interestiing plot lines.  I was too young for this when it was originally shown, and watched it at home for the first time during a period of extended illness.  Really, just magnificent.
B00DJYJQ36|4.0|\\"This is real life. It isn't perfect but it's real and if you can't see it then your blind.\\" 20 years after their first meeting and 9 years since their reconnection Jesse (Hawke) and Celine (Delpy) are married and living in Paris. They summer they are spending in Greece is almost over and Jesse's son is heading back to America. This little event leads to Jesse questioning his decisions in life and leads to trouble in his marriage. In preparation for watching this movie I watched the two previous ones. Before Sunrise was OK but a little slow moving. Before Sunset was better but still nothing amazing. This one is far and away the best of the trilogy and feels the most real. Sunrise is about a chance meeting on a train. Sunset is about reconnecting love after a book tour brings him to the place she is. This one deals with real world issues and finally answers the question of if these two should be together or should they have left it as a one night meeting. I'm sure I'm not the only one to say this but this reminded me of me and my wife and fights we have had. That aspect may have helped me really get into this movie but either way this is the best of the three and I recommend this which is something I can't really say about the other two. Overall, a movie for couples to watch together. Most will see similarities. I liked it. I give it a B+.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|My daugther and I really enjoyed playing the game. It was lots of fun. I recommend it for anyone that likes the angry birds franchise.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|awesome CPU, overclocked mine to 4.3GHZ and it runs smoothly, never had a stutter. Its dont run hot at all ethier with all my setting ether. The highest my cpu ever got ( with a Evo hyper 212 cpu cooler ) was up to 55C and that was running Crysis 3 on the highest setting.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|This is the first book of hers that I have read. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It kept me coming back and wanting more and more. The characters kept me in suspense and always wondering. Just when I think I may have it figured out. BOOM. I had figured wrong. Can't wait to read the next!
B005QYKD4I|5.0|Family movie and lots of action<br />Would defintely watch it again<br />And again<br />Its almost as if the movie was so alive
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I am going to give this app a five star, I also have pic pro as well.  This app is very user friendly, and actually has some different items to use.  While both apps are great, I equally enjoy playing with both of them.  I love the auto fix that comes with this app, I did end up buying the full version for 4.99 cents, and I really feel it was worth every penny.  I have had no problems saving pictures or uploading them to facebook.  Everyone is always commenting on how they like my pictures and such.

B005MHI0QM|5.0|What more can be said for Anne Frank's biography? There is not a student alive who shouldn't be made to read this book. It's absolutely imperative that it be read and understood.
B00FF8OKJE|1.0|I never figured out how to play, so l deleted from my kindle. I thought this game needed some guidelines.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|I enjoyed everything about this show; the characters, the music, and the drama was all captivating.....can't wait to view season 2
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I don't often connect emotionally with characters. This boo? Is different. The innocence  & honesty drive the people in the novel into to your heart.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|great alarm clock!!!! didnt think it would worn butbits amazing, I would let people know about this si they can gefvit for themselves

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wow..... I finished the complete series and want more. I have had to go to Ms. Christie to read about &#34;what ifs&#34; with Silo 49. Thanks for Mr. Howey's approval of her book so that us Wool followers can moderately satisfy our hunger for more of the wool series. I recommend that readers put this high on their read list.
B00AG297GK|1.0|This movie is not funny.  My wife could not finish watching it.  It has no entertainment value at all.  If you are looking for humor, you'll not find it in the &#34;Dictator&#34;.
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|First of all, i just want to say ariana is the best singer ever i  my opinion atleast. I lovvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvve her and her music she's better than Mariah Carey. so thats how you know she's great and all you haters don't hate her cause you ain't her Dang deal with it and lovvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvve her. SECOND IJLAG does anyone know what that means
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I had read Victor Hugo's masterpiece in High School many years ago and decided to re-read it on vacation this past week.  I had forgotten a lot of the nuances of the story that were overlooked in both the Broadway play and recent Hollywood movie.  As important as the characters themselves, is the reality based depiction of the French Revolution in the 19th century.  War is never easy to depict and yet Hugo created an atmosphere where grief, illness , tragedy, hope and .love all co-exist.  If it is not on mandatory reading lists for students, it should be.  One of the best books of all time.
B00E3BK0QQ|3.0|Just not long enough,a couple of the puzzles didn't understand, hard.<br />I liked the game not enough to do and some hard to understand. Thank you.<br />It's a 3
B003NTSBUG|4.0|There are so few films that build up suspense without a major letdown at the ending. This film is satisfying from beginning to end. It can be appreciated for its writing, acting, cinematography, and story -- a rare combination for a suspenseful film. I was pleasantly surprised.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Omg my friend recommended this app and now I love it I have no problems with it and I like when u can block people and that your friends couldn't see the messages u send to other people unless u invite
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|The final book in the triology and the best of the three. Seemed to me a door was left open for more in the series or maybe the reader ismeant to imagine book four for him or herself. When I finished the last apge I began to reread parts I thought special---that makes a 5 start book for sure.
B002CAWNEM|5.0|Awesome movie I love it there was no scratches at all Im glad I got it thanks you so much

B002KSPKRS|5.0|For everyone thinking about trashing these earphones I would like to say , I was one of you. I was so disappointed by the consist popping and audio loss during my live matches I couldn't believe I didn't listen to everybody's negative reviews. I even,the other day purchased a downgraded pair of turtle beach earphones, the X31. Then just by luck..... my son asked me since i was getting the X31s , could we move these into the living room for the 4gig xbox.  And low and behold ...NO MORE POPPING OR AUDIO LOSS! I really think it had something to do with being so close to my WIFI router that was causing all the problems,.now I listen to movies in beautiful 7.1 Dolby and never had a problem again and its been a week now, So maybe its something about the reception from the 2.4 RF X41s and WIFI .Canceled those x31s. I don't know about anyone else but it solved my problem without a doubt and I'm happy i didn't trash them.
B008S4YZCO|4.0|I just don't have time to explore it right now.  Started it then removed it from my device, but not my cloud as I think I'll have to give it a better try sometime down the road.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|Well.<br />So far so good. This is my first shot at this sort of game.<br />I'm still stuck on the opening section. I did manage to find and remove the Flints and the Special Stone.<br />The hints have helped me to think on this. The secret manual has certain pictures that I'm sure are meaningful.<br />But I'm still stuck on the first section even though I found the keyhole in the Lion statue and the secret message panel on the door.<br />This is a good one. I do endorse it. The problem is getting my head into the whole process.<br />I will.<br />Don't be afraid of this. Great quality, good stuff.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|I was super anxious to see this after all the rave I heard about it.  So I gathered up my friend and we went, expecting greatness. What we got was a typical movie about some bandit befriending a kid....blah blah blah.  Its watchable and even slightly enjoyable to watch once, but that's it.  Its also easily  forgettable and Matthew's acting is typical and bland.
B00BMR4RIG|3.0|This app is ok as far as it goes .I expect to try a more complicated one in the near future.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Good developing character relationships and interesting cases/situations. Very good casting for parts.  Another similar show is &#34;The Good Wife&#34;. Can't wait to see where the show goes.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|My daughter and I both have Kindle Fires and both have different tastes.  We often try new apps, then find they don't suit us.  I worried about finding a simple way to clean up the bacoground, and then I found Clean Master.  Quick as a wink, thorough and makes a difference sometimes my daughter has so much going on on hers that apps lose their thumbnail graphic - after a clean sweep. it's all fine again.  I also have started using the Apps Manager in this rather than the one the Kindle has - it just makes sense.  Very happy with the product and will happily recommend it to anyone I know who has one.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|If you have a phone, a tablet, a computer and more, this is the APP for you.<br />Your documents and more can be placed in Dropbox for easy access by your equipment.<br />I put my user's manuals on for quick access.<br />Pictures, documents and all can easily be placed in dropbox.<br />Things are easy to clear should they become dated or no longer needed.<br />No new or difficult techniques to be learned to use it.<br />This is a great APP and it is helpful almost every day.<br />Can't go wrong on this one.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|I have enjoyed all the Die Hard movies, understanding that they are over the top and ridiculous.  However, this movie was just awfully ridiculous.  The acting grade F. Its as if Bruce woke up hungover one day and got a call from a producer and this is what happened:<br />Producer- \\"Bruce! Whats up...wanna make some money today?\\"<br />BRUCE - \\"argh, sure, why not, will it take long?\\"<br />Producer - \\"Naw, I have another Die Hard movie in the works, the name alone should draw millions, Ill write the plot before you get here...but I am thinking Russian spy stuff sounds good\\"<br />BRUCE - \\"Sure, why not, I could use a new house in Malibu\\"<br /><br />After Bruce gets to the studio he meets the horrible actors and the hot Russian Chick and says, \\"Lets do this!\\"<br /><br />So they shoot for one day and then Brucey goes home.  That's all he needed for this trash.  No retakes, or anything because most the action scenes are CGI and the acting so bad, its beyond Grade B movie.  The plot is silly and Bruce's son just seems to be thrown in there.<br /><br />My friend and I kepy watching and hoping it would be worthy of something.  But the reality is, its awful. DONT waste your time on this movie.  It does not do any of the Die Hard movies justice and for God's sake if you do watching it, DONT WATCH IT on an LCD in HD or you will see just how freaking tired and old Bruce actually is.
0060734191|5.0|The books area great and easy read. They take you into a world that is similar to our own but with a twist to make it way more exciting.
B00CHI5F5S|5.0|The movie was executed with high class entertainment, and Josh Brolin was awesome and starring carry on the torch we realistic talent and preferment best action crime movie ever.
B00FJU1HLC|5.0|Fun movie!! You won't be disappointed!!!! It's funny, has spectacular animation and is all around fun to watch for all ages.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Great read.  Can't wait to read more of the author's books.  The miniseries, the White Queen, is awesome. A must watch
B009XIXVU6|5.0|No review will do justice to the beauty of this book. It is an amazing and gorgeous epic story. Hosseini is lyrical.
B00BAXFDLM|5.0|Not an easy book to begin with gender confusion, identity confusion as to narrator and deadly mysteries layered on top of each other. A narration jumping from various separate timelines that slowly converges. By the end I found the book quite clever and well worth reading.
B000O77RLE|4.0|This is historical. I walked away with a better understanding of what the Japanese soldiers went thru on Iwo Jima.To see in Blue-ray,worth its price.Easy to find,order,delivery were quite fast.A must have with Flags of our fathers.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Cool game totally addictive good way to pass the time  or keep yourself awake trying to figure the out the puzzle.  :-)
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The plot for this novel is complicated but worth the extra thought. It is a well written well told story with interesting interwoven stories
B00338QENI|5.0|Rebecca Skloot may have learned about Henrietta Lacks in her college Biology class, but many people never have.  There have been recent articles in the newspaper detailing &#34;the rest of the story&#34; for the Lacks family.  My 11th grade high school students are required to read it and exclaim that it is very &#34;eye-opening&#34;.  It is current stuff, and a must read for everyone who values privacy in their lives and medical procedures.
B00EQF2EIG|5.0|A fun movie to watch. Story is wonderful; acting is great! I enjoyed watching the traditional lines being integrated into a modern setting.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|Love this game ,really have to on your toes with.this one.it's fast paced and colorful.Will tell all my friends to
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Like listening to a private conversation you find horrifying but just can't step away from the door.<br /><br />Very good book.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|I always thought that I had to hire a &#34;salesperson&#34; to represent my product.  After reading this book, I changed my outlook totally on selling and have found more success selling than was the case with &#34;professional salespeople&#34; that I hired in the past.  I've also changed what attributes I'm looking for when hiring sales staff.<br /><br />Before I read this book I thought selling was ALL about numbers, but I now see that my natural instinct to engage in a conversation about the problems that the product solves, as opposed to trying to get a person to buy, has been far, far, far more effective.  I now am able to get 8 to 9 out of every 10 prospects to carry my product.  I have a greater expectation, from the research presented in this book, that my &#34;no hype&#34; style will allow the prospect to better focus on the benefits derived from the product.
B00594XOZU|1.0|It's not loading. I've been using it do months and now when I try to log in it doesn't load.
B00CATSONE|1.0|Had I paid for this, I'd want a refund (I got it while it was free to downlod).  Tesla isn't even mentioned until 30% of the way in.  It reads more like a self help pamphlet than a book, and is equally short.  Read the Wikipedia article, you'll get more out of it.
1567184855|5.0|Truly enjoyed this book!  It is written a little text books but gave some real  ideas as to what heaven could be like.  True? Never know, have not been there!
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I had already seen season 1 of Castle, so I knew I'd enjoy the content. What I was worried about was the condition. I was worried that it would be wrecked, considering how little I paid for it. I was worried for no reason. It was great!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This app has great graphics! If you love doing hair, this is definatley for you! My kids love it! Even my son! Great Quality + Fun=Great App
B0071BGOJC|5.0|I Loved this book its the second book of three . I cant wait to for the third book to come out. Ken Follett writes so easy its effortless to get into the characters you feel as you know them. I would highly recommend this book. Don't  start reading it until you have a lot of time as it is hard to put it down
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I think I liked this even more than Gone Girl.  So many threads all joining together for a satisfying ending.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun to play and Runs smooth. My kids and I enjoy it. I like being able to choose from so many different settings as well.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This show was very original and kept you both in suspense and cheering for the success of the characters throughout.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This book is succinctly written and the supplement chapter alone is worth the price. However, if you really want this to work, you have to work hard. Work hard in this sense is not just in terms of the time and the amount of the workout that you have to do, but also in the nutrition aspect.<br /><br />In order to build muscle/shred fat, you need to be very precise with you caloric intake. Your margin of error is only 50~100 K cal per day, so this requires a very precise calorie measurement. Are you willing to buy grocery, weight in the ingredients, and cook? For beginners, this is a massive adjustment. Also, to save time, you usually will cook and divide the food in same portions. Are you willing to eat the same food few days in a row? And if you dine out for social reasons or have dinner with your family, this can also ruin your calorie calculation, because you don't know what ingredients they use or how they cook. I personally find the nutrition part very hard to follow, so I just use common sense and eat the right food.<br /><br />The workout part is actually relatively easy for me. Mike suggests for each major muscle group, you only need to do 9 sets of 4~6 repetitions(80% of 1 RM). Before, I used to do somewhere like 16 sets of 10 reps(60% of 1 RM). After I have shorten my total reps from 160 to 36~54, I feel that I am more explosive during lifting and become more exhausted after each set.<br /><br />In addition, Mike is very responsive. Once I asked him a question unrelated to the book, he answered within 2 days.<br /><br />Overall, Mike's book offers a lot of useful advises and a workout plan that you can instantly adopt. He also shows you a lot of mistakes he made over the years so you don't have to. If there is one thing I least like it is that I think the supplement part is too hardcore. For me I think spirulina and fish oil are good enough.
B002QE3CTY|3.0|The story is good, the premise is new.  The character development wasn't that great.  I realize part of the premise was that they last their memories but still, the characters weren't that deep
B000JCQCW4|5.0|This is an amazing movie! I would recommend it to anyone! The acting is absolutely fantastic, and unique. Great, great, movie!
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|I changed to Pulse as soon as it was launched, I pre-ordered from Amazon. It is brilliant, works really well (I was sceptical about the two-week battery life from such a tiny unit, but it does last). I have it clipped to my wallet in my trouser pocket and it goes everywhere with me. I also have the Withings Smart Scales and Blood Pressure Monitor and they, plus My Fitness Pal, have improved my fitness considerably, I cannot recommend too highly. Geoff
B000YHB7TC|4.0|I enjoy when they come out with a new idea for a horror movie. I enjoy the elaborate ways that death hunted all the people down. you think one thing will happen and then bam it happens another way. would recommend.
B0015DWLD0|4.0|The protagonist of this book is an oddly disgusting but likeable character. The story takes place in contemporary India and sheds some light onto the social/economic situation there. I read several reviews by Indians who said this is an accurate portrayal. I read this for a women's book club - a church book club - so I want to let people know there is quite a bit of profanity in the book.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|it is a good game. It is a good way to waste some time. I just wish that you could expand without the price going up every time because with all the animals they want you to have there is no room for them all.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|It was good for pay preview at $3.99.  Not good enough to pay for to see in theater. I did enjoy watching it with my 16 year old son.
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|I was surprised how funny and clean this movie was. It was great for the little ones in the family to also see and enjoy with the older kids. I recommend it.
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|I liked the preview, so I rented this movie. It got off to a great start, but the middle slowed and the ending was blah.
B00FPGV3RS|2.0|I had high expectations of this given the cast and the story line. It is a lot like the TV series Reaper. Except I actually enjoyed Reaper. This was boring. I love Sci Fi and I am easily entertained usually, but this movie just had no substance. You don't really care about the characters and nothing surprising or unpredictable really happens. It got a second star because it has a good cast.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|Loved it. Not a five, but it rocked. For the third movie it keep up. Not sure how I liked the ending. It kind of ended the movie so their might not be a Iron Man 4.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|If you love Ice Age you will love this app...very good graphics and fun to play. My kids love it.
B0084YAU86|5.0|loved it.  And can't wait for more.  And the lead actor was brilliant in the latest star trek!  He is an amazing actor.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The beginning of this story it a little slow, but once you are hooked you can not put the book down!
B008M7JODC|4.0|Good starting point....glad they ditched the sister and niece.  Love the star trek refrences and playing the observer game is fun.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game drives me crazy in a fun way....Very fast moving game must have good reflexes and hand to eye coordination but you find yourself hooked really quick. FUN!
B0053TMP24|5.0|I am 63 years old and I am greatly enjoying this &#34;so called&#34; kids book.  It is a fun read.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I'm kind of a sci-fi enthusiast, but wanted to read this book before it becomes a major motion picture. I'm not really sure how they can grab the emotional levels in the movie, and they definantly have their work cut out for them.<br /><br />However, I felt that this book really read very well. It moved along without getting too muddled down. I like the way CARD writes... he does a very good job grappling with some very difficult subject matter, and uses an expanded vocabulary without being too pretentious.<br /><br />This book has found it's way into the 'tween world, and it should do remarkably well. This book could have easy gotten extremely dark into the &#34;battle&#34; side of this world, or very cheesy into the &#34;poor little kid&#34; side of the world.<br /><br />This is a coming of age story, told in a new and exciting way... original subject matter, and original writing.<br /><br />I highly recommend it!<br /><br />flag
B00B32YK96|3.0|Nothing special. Would not recommend it, but it gave me something to do for a couple of hours watching it.
B00DZP3KJ0|5.0|Easy to read, well explained. This book is a must have for any photographer looking to improve her/his photographic skills, besides learning how to organize and develop a systematic work flow.
B006AZZPCM|2.0|Maybe it didn't load right?  I just couldn't get it to work for me.  I like to put songs on my Kindle and wanted a few extra for my hospital stay and it just didn't work.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|After Ender Wiggin completes the first book... This is what happens to the rest of his life.<br />And it's good! And it should be read!<br /><br />Like Ender's Game, I felt that this book really read very well. The subject matter is a little heavier, and you can see the time and changes in the author's life reflected in his writing style.<br /><br />His subject matter expands from a simple coming of age story, to dealing with many older (and more worldly concepts). I won't reveal any spoilers here, but this is a much more thorough, and adult-concept type of book.<br /><br />I've got to say... this was the book he wanted to write... and did and excellent job!<br /><br />I highly recommend it!
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|It reminds me of the ever-popular 4 Pics 1 Word games. It kills time, but I get stuck sometimes and don't want to pay for new coins.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|I love this game I used to only play it on my friends ipods but they finally made it for kindle!!! The only thing I'm dissapointed about is that when you play the moose shooting minigame, you can only hold up to 2 fingers on the screen at once so I always lose a life when I play it.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Just started playing this game and I am enjoying it so far. Need to play it longer before I can really rate it.
B003U0AHBO|1.0|I purchased 4 items in this order, and 3 of them work just fine. Robin Hood, purchased from Amazon LLC (IIRC), keeps freezing. You have to skip a part of the movie and wind forward to a place that will play to continue the movie at all. I played it multiple times to make sure, and it keeps freezing on the same spots (about 6 of them) throughout the movie, and that within both the theatrical and \\"director's cut\\" versions (included on the disk).<br />The Amazon offered troubleshooting help just says to check that I have the correct region version, which I do. There is a stamp on the foil covering the jacket of the disk that says \\"Made in Mexico,\\" but on the jacket itself it states region 1 and it also says it was specifically created for markets in USA and Canada (I am in the USA).<br />I have purchased this disk when I was travelling (as I did not expect problems) and I did not get to try it out until I came back to the USA (where I go to school) from my summer break, which is why the free return period has expired. But I wonder if there is still something that can be done...
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Never have been big on dramas.  One day a friend was talking about it and loaned me seasons 1-3.  Watched the first episode and was hooked.  Didn't stop watching til I was finished with all seasons.  With in days I was caught up with the series.  Couldn't wait till the next.  It only got better each episode.  Sad it's over but enjoyed every show till the end.
B00AHDXTIK|1.0|I left this cord plugged into my work computer for a few days. I had turned the computer off for the long weekend expecting everything to be ok. when I came back I discovered that none of my USB ports worked on my computer. I also noticed that the lightning side of the cable had burn marks and the metal tip had melted and completely disfigured itself. our IT person told me the repair would involve checking the motherboard and replacing all USB ports. repairs that would be more than the cost of a brand new computer. $500 later im regretting not spending the extra $2 to buy the actual apple product. now when I hear about a girl being electrocuted in China for using a 3rd party charger, ill believe it more.<br />[...]
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a lot of fun and challenging. The whole family loves it and tend to have fights over who's turn it is.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|The title is meant to be read in a snarky, teen voice. The kid of voice that the author captures so well. I can't articulate well enough how wonderful the writing is. Simple sentences that capture so much of what the characters are feeling, what is said and what is unsaid. What they can't even articulate to themselves. This book is raw, and beautiful, and brave and true. It captures something deep and universal about being young and in love. About being poor and powerless. How friendship and love can save you, can give you hope. And how sometimes you need to leave everything to save yourself, breaking your own heart in the process.<br /><br />I haven't been this emotionally impacted by a book in many years. Do yourself a favor and read it.
B00EMAGCJM|1.0|This album represents everything that is wrong with the music industry. Whether Cyrus has some talent or not (obviously she can sing and was groomed to be a celeb from birth), this album shows clearly that she is not a true musician that stands on her own. When you listen to these songs realize that everything from her voice to the drums is either programmatically created or done through replacement (where the drums are replaced later with pre-recorded or synthesized instruments). Nothing about the album is real. The generic progressions and predictable clubby electro-pop sound is the equivalent of eating synthesized soy burgers that taste like hamburger, but are neither soy nor real meat. These songs, the lyrics - all formulaic Cracker Jack sketches that took no time or creativity to make. This music is in essence a figment of your imagination. It is a sad trend these days that the music industry takes kids like Cyrus with pre-celeb status or Bieber who blew up on youtube and turns them into cash cows at their own expense. The kids don't care because they are young, getting rich and most importantly getting ridiculous amounts of attention. The parents are wooed by the prospect of riches. The moguls behind it all are sitting back watching the whole thing unfold, and generating sales and hype based on publicity stunts  - negative or positive at any cost to keep these people in the spotlight and keep up interest. The whole thing is pretty evil really. There are some good bands and musicians out there and there is nothing wrong with marrying some electronic sounds and other effects with music. In The Air Tonight by Phil Collins is one of the best examples of a song doing that to the greatest effect. Pink Floyd used amazing synthesized effects in their music. The Roots is another great example of using technology with real instruments and brilliant creative ability. Bangerz sounds more like programmatically generated music for a bad video game though, and will never stand the test of time.
B008Q08IV4|5.0|I love this movie. I have seen it many times and still enjoy watching it.Tom Hanks does so well being Forrest Gump.
B00F7YHDWC|2.0|This game is fun, but does not work on the Kindle Fire. The hunting game is impossible later on because you may only use 2 fingers on the kindle, so when I get to it, I don't even try. It is not worth it. Please fix or I will remove from my Kindle.<br />Thanks,  OManPhilly
B00E8TVHBA|5.0|My daughter is a huge fan.  We had a chance to participate in the Teen Beach Party at Disney's Typhoon Lagoon.  Totally brought the movie to life for her!!!
B0094M4R3Q|4.0|My kids have watched this movie many times, and love it! My seven-year-old daughter was motivated to read the book by Roald Dahl. She loved both, but still prefers the movie.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|There is something about the look of this cover that I liked as soon as I saw it.  I also have a Vera Bradley cover and I can't decide which one I like more.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I loved this book!  It drew me in very quickly and moved along at a great pace.  I am a King fan, but it has been awhile since I read a book of his.  Now I can't wait to read another.  I highly recommend this one.
B008Y768XO|5.0|Loved this movie. Heartbreaking and heartwarming all at the same time. I would highly recommend this story to dog lovers everywhere.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Love the game ..... hate the glitches!!!!  Freezes everyday!!!!!<br /><br />Might deserve higher ratings if they'd fix the game!!!<br /><br />Get a clue!!!
B00F91SCXC|3.0|Brad Pitt plays  a hero with a kind of  mysterious background which made me wonder how he could be so accomplished in all things. Production and photography well done  Sort of formulaic. Not bad in a &#34;B&#34; movie kind of vein. Watch it as a backup if you  already seen the better sumner movies.
1616551151|5.0|If you love the Dragon Age universe this book is a must have. From the artwork, to the actual canon story facts to the history, to the explanation of things previously unanswered this book is just fantastic. Very HIGH quality writing, very HIGH quality paper and very HIGH quality art work this book is the whole package. My only single complaint is, at just over 180 pages it should have been two to three times as longer. This is not a real complaint but just a testament to how nice it is. I really, really enjoyed this book even though I am NOT a fan of David Gaider's writing which I find very underwhelming, Luckily it is to my understanding that he only approved of the details in the book and wrote part of the introductions.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|I loved, loved  this disc it played fine I can listen to it all day. I will order again in the near future<br />I was very please with my orders. Thank you very much. email me when you have a sale .<br /><br />(madol67@att.net)
B008HJGPVO|4.0|I like this product because it is functional on several of my touchscreen devices.  I would love to see a stylus with a smaller &#34;tip&#34; lessening the number of times needed to press for smoother on screen activations.
B00867HDTA|5.0|This game is amazing spent plenty of hours on it now so very addictive would highly recommend it to everyone
1416524800|5.0|Well what can I say. Once again Dan Brown has told a wonderful story, full of intrigue and twists and turns.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Haven't had much time to devote but hope to soon.  It's lots of fun and there are many great projects and ideas out there.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is easy and fun. My kids like playing it when they are at the doctors office. Great way to cure boredom.
B00FEJIVRQ|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. is the ONLY Iron Man!  Love that Gwen Paltrow had a more active roll and kicked butt!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Whether you agree with Sandberg or not, she presents compelling points that should at least be considered by any woman in the working world.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|The new Kahn, way better! Stepped out of the traditional role and made him the perfect Anti- Kirk! They gotta bring him back! Does this mean Kirk will have his abilities now?
B0090KZDSK|4.0|Love this trilogy. But a bit disappointed at the ending of this book. No closure  after a long wait. Is there more???
B00BBW15R8|5.0|Good story of the &#34;new normal&#34; exploration after paralysis when rich man hires a<br />charming survivor/thriver from the other side of the tracks.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|I had never heard of this show before, but decided to check in out on my kindle...omg I love it.  I ended up watching 1 1/2 seasons in 2 days, and now 2 of my daughters are hooked on it too.  Very funny and enjoyable to watch.
B008JFLWLE|4.0|Very fun and useful app! Great for people to enjoy math a bit more. It would be best to use this app with a pen as using your fingers can be sloppy
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|pros<br />1.small<br />2.&#34;wireless&#34; (you need a usb conection for energy)<br /><br />1.you need a wi-fi connection,<br />2.second you need a router that handles very high speeds.<br />3.Only works with chrome navigator or youtube (maybe more programs, those are the ones I found that worked)<br />4.It doesn't show full screen, just the window.<br /><br />I rather buy the Netgear PUSH2TV HD PTV2000 . for a couple of bucks more, and works great (is more bulky)
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|Pepper looked great.  I always enjoyed humor.  good action.  could have explained the special treatment a little more as I enjoyed the scientific aspect of the prior two movies.  good overall and enjoyable.
B0031RS894|4.0|I'm not an avid book reader but I like reading Dr Who, the story line is good. I normally read westerns.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|At first it was slow to comprehend what was really happening but it is one of those movies that at the end everything seems to fall into place. Pretty good special effects.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a great game. I play this game more than my k ok we. I would recommend this game to everyone. It is fun for all ages
B004A8ZWVK|1.0|I chose this rating because it is not authentic , the language was not real<br />the book is humiliating of my Negro beautiful  friends.<br />The author was writing for Hollywood effect, comedy.My friends  are proud , they treat  all people the way they want to be treated.<br />For some years I was the only white lady on the street, my best friend was black, I worked for many years in a large hospital.,<br />The black people I know are kind ,thoughtful , because they have been thru so much adversity.this book was not about real people but a comedy.they would never mess their delicious pie for revenge , they are respectful etc.. The movie had great actors.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I really like my Chromecast and ordered another after a week of getting the 1st one.<br /><br />Pros: easy setup; renting movies, watching YouTube videos through Google Play is very easy; able to cast Chrome browser; play back quality is excellent after a short buffer.<br />Cons: limited applications that support Chromecast but hope this is temporary.
B00D2ZF3GQ|1.0|Bad reviews.Decided it wasn't worth it. Very disappointed. Will Smith is one of my favorite actors.I hope his next movie is better.
B00F7YHDWC|2.0|I think this game is very very inappropriate for kids and kind of disturbing. It has some things not good for kids.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Keep doing what you're doing with more frequent shows, if at all possible. Each actor is outstanding, believable, and consistently in character.
B0039OGGVQ|5.0|Hello I'm telling you the order arrived and everything is in perfect condition. I'll keep buying more stuff. They are of very good quality. 100% recommended.
B00EC7GRS6|5.0|This item works perfectly!!! All these reviews complain about nothing. It is a magnetic coupler! Once you put your phone on it, just move it left and right and it will click in place. Thats it!! There is no rail guide when putting it in so people miss the magnet... thats all.<br /><br />Anyone who buys the Z Ultra should buy this. Then you won't wear out the rubber seal on the USB charge port from opening and closing it all the time and help the phone stay waterproof longer!!!<br /><br />Only flaw is there is no outlet adapter, just a USB cord coming out of the dock. But still more then worth buying to help preserve the seal and looks great on the dresser holding phone up.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I enjoyed reading much f this. It is relaxing and enjoyable.  The characters are interesting  and at times I am curious enough to examine some of the people in the novel, a little more that would add to the novel.<br /><br />Bob Hammond
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game has entertained me for hours this game is awesome. It is meant for anyone who wants to play. I hope everyone else feels the same.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I think I spend too much time with this game!  It is fun and keeps you trying to beat the game.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Music and fade features are calling to test and wake. Best of all always goes off...power failure, cat tripped the cord, etc.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Excellent. A believable story coming from an expert brain scientist & former non-believer! Recommend this book written by a neurosurgeon.
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|I really  thought this movie was a waste of time and money, the plot was Childess and the actors seem to Struggle with their parts l would give this one star out of five.
B00631VJIC|5.0|This compilation is as good as the show.  All songs are covers but all are really good renditions of great hits
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|App was recently sold and format was changed.  The game no longer is as much fun.  With the changes, many crashes and system down.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this thinking about the movie that is coming, but now I wonder how close the movie will be to the book!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Afghans made really human , gives some insight into the country as it was and is today  ! I so enjoyed this latest book , definitely as good as his previous ones .
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|I loved Derek Trucks when he had his own band, but joining with Susan Tedeschi has really upped the ante on what was already great music.
B005PK57IK|4.0|This series offers great entertainment, including good story line, characters, acting, and cleverness of plots, Very well organized and presented.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Amazing book. It keeps you wanting more! The books captures you with the odd love story of two opposites who live different life styles.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Loved it getting ready to start second books  Worth it to buy omnibus edition. Then you don't have to stop reading
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Love the whole franchise. Next series... Men In Black Back To The Future &#34;Marty's Revenge&#34; Ya never know, it could happen, Have your people call my people and we'll lunch, okay babe?
B005XN31LY|5.0|Loved having a whole season to watch at my own leisure.  I will probably buy more episodes like this in the future
0062255657|1.0|I bought this book through Kindle, based upon the very positive reviews posted within.  After struggling through 20% of it I set it aside for several weeks.  After that I reread that part and tried to read on forward, looking for the excitement others professed for this book.<br /><br />I just didn't get it.  I did not finish it(read 26%), nor will I give it another try.  I'm happy for those who enjoyed it, I'm just not one of them.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved the rich characters, their intertwining stories, their faults and their strengths. K. Hosseini is a talented story teller.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great story!  After you learn the secret, the author keeps the reader in suspense, you will wonder what will happen next.  I couldn't put it down!
B008476HBM|5.0|I've always enjoyed this novel by Jane Austen, even more so now that it is digital and therefore portable. Allowing me to take it with me on road-trips and to school. I'm rather happy with this. :)
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I read this book because of the motion picture that is coming out soon. I have heard great things about this book yet I found it lacking in many ways. It is not a masterpiece nor a series that I will follow.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I bought this for my Kindle app and am so happy with my purchase. Makes for easy reading and I like having the option to buy my books on Amazon.
B009JZTP4Y|5.0|This was a wonderful,exciting and funny. Able share with family time this classicmovie and everyone enjoyed. Since it is getting hard to find family scifi that's not horror.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|I really enjoyed Iron Man 3 for the fact that it hailed back to the first film--a lot of the premise involved Tony's development as a person, dealing with issues which plague him. Unlike the narcissism from the I.M. 1, however, the PTSD Stark is now facing is the end result of the Avengers movie.<br /><br />I like the correlation between the movies, as they work toward building the universe itself as a whole so that it seems more real and also tangible--given that he is dealing with issues that anyone could have in real life.<br /><br />Excellent work with the acting and the plot choices. Action sequences were interesting and many times fun, especially in situations when he had to think outside the box.
B00FGM0IEU|5.0|LOVE THIS MOVIE! We are from Florence , Alabama , part of the tri cities that includes Muscle Shoals. We own a music store here, but this movie showed us much more than we ever thought we knew about our music industry here!  It's fantastic! If you love music, you need to see this!
141694737X|5.0|I bought this for my grandson.  The shipping was super fast and I was extremely pleased with the quality of the product. I would highly recommend!
B00DB31Y3U|1.0|Dumb game not worth it. Just a waist of time! Totally has no purpose. Delete the game! Delete the game!
B008469DGY|4.0|It's not difficult.  And a great time killer.  Fun is the name of the game.  There needs to be more simple yet pleasant titles out there.
B00C0NFMKI|5.0|When I found out Paramore had dropped a new album I knew I had to get it because I really enjoyed their older stuff. At first listen I didn't really know what to think of the album because it didn't sound like Paramore of the \\"Riot!\\" days. It wasn't what I was expecting and I waited a few days and listened again with different expectations. That listen made me realize it is actually an extremely solid album, just with a different but just as good sound, possibly even better in ways. I'd definitely say this year it has been the best album I've bought, definitely worth the money. The more I listen to it the more I like it, there aren't really too many poor songs on the album which was one of the things I liked about \\"Riot!\\" I can actually listen to the whole album without skipping songs. Looking forward to more of their music.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I THINK IT IS THE BEST SHOW ON T.V.  THE ACTING IS TOP NOTCH.  I HOPE THE SERIES CONTINUES FOR YEARS TO COME.
B00139XTG4|4.0|Excellent thesis and reasonably well written. I think it could have been richer in illustrative examples but I will probably read it a second time.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|Not as good as the first one, but then again, they never are. Was nice to see Gweneth P do some acting.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|I recommend this movie for families, couples, or anyone for that matter.  It's entertaining, even heart warming. I even recommend listening to the sound track as it scrolls through the credits.  I also want to thank those who gave their reviews for this flick.  That why I rented it, and it was totally worth it.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I am amazed at the quality of the graphics. The puzzles are fun,  challanging, but not to frustrating.  The story is a mystery that is very good so far.  I haven't bought the rest of the game yet,  but unlike others I do not think that $4.99 is too much to pay for all the effort that goes into making the good quality games that provide such fun.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Just finished reading for the second time. Wish book two was coming sooner.<br />I love the book and highly recommend it.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I really like it it is really easy to follow and I feel I am really  learning  as I go!
B003DTMUOE|5.0|No words can describe this book better than its own, it has help me since the first time I read it and specially now  that I feel down and depressed. Thanks Coelho, your books have influenced my life.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I liked this book because of the characters and the vivid details of the beautiful surrounding area. I look forward to reading more of what Jill Sanders has written.
B00932HEX2|2.0|Sheesh, what a slow-paced bore fest. The series started out with promise but quickly bogged down. I dislike EVERY!!! single character. There's not one I find interesting least of all Claire Danes whose character is totally unbelievable. Add the gratuitous sex and the foul language that would be totally unlikely for most of the real characters, and I quickly grew tired of the whole thing. And I didn't care if Damian Lewis's character turned out to be a terrorist or not. Who cares when you're falling asleep waiting for something to happen. Far inferior to 24.
0060926317|5.0|I have visited Australia and after reading this book I have a new respect for the Aborginal people and their abilities to survive in the outback.  This book also had great counsel on how to live life and let go of past pain and hurts.  It was a great book.
B004EPZ00C|4.0|I enjoyed the 2003 original \\"Johnny English\\" very much and was happy to find this sequel.<br /><br />If you've had a bad day and need a \\"funny break\\" to forget your troubles or if you are looking for a movie the whole family can enjoy together, Johnny English Reborn and Johnny English are both great picks.<br /><br />The stories in these two movies are not directly related so it doesn't really matter which one you view first. But do view them both, you won't be sorry.<br /><br />You can read my full review of Johnny English at: myreallifereviews . com
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|I preordered this book after reading the mostly positive reviews on Amazon.  The story is told from the point of view of a genetics professor with at least a moderate degree of Asperger's syndrome, and this is what makes the book engaging.  Don Tillman, the protaganist, is clueless when it comes to reading other people, and this is the source of the novel's humor.  I have read that good fiction gives the reader a rare opportunity to look inside the mind of another person, and looking at the world through Don Tillman's mind is a hilarious and eye opening experience.  He meets Rosie through his &#34;Wife Project&#34; and immediately recognizes her as the least compatable person imaginable.  Although she sees Don for exactly what he is, she is able to overlook his quirks and focus on his goodheartedness and total honesty.  It might be hard to imagine these two getting together in real life, but as a novel, it works.  A funny, touching and engaging book.
0783240287|5.0|Great music and very entertaining. I say the original stage play with the Ozmond family in the 90's and having this DVD in my collection is awesome!!
B002NXOQF2|4.0|It starts out pretty slow and boring, but as it goes on you really get into the story and action.
B008YU7IGW|5.0|Wonderful book. I listen to it daily. I would suggest it to friends. I have given it as a gift.
B004A2V3K0|5.0|Good song choices for the album. I have been a Bon Jovi fan since Slippery When Wet. Enjoy the songs.
B006GHA9QQ|3.0|This was a poor attempt at a sequel to the most awesome play ever. Although I did not fall asleep, I would likely never watch it again.
B00EDOS6IC|3.0|This review is not going to be one from a AB diehard nor will it be from a AB hater, I am a fan, but it will be objective. Let me begin by saying that I was  anticipating this release as much as anybody, but I can't help say that I am a little disappointed. Is it heavier than all previous AB albums? Yes it is. But that doesn't mean that it is the best of the collection either. I am of the opinion that Blackbird is their best record. Why? Balance. It is well balanced with heavier arrangements, delicate ballads, hopeful lyrics and an optimistic view of life to overcome your struggles. I didn't get this from AB III (which was pretty melancholy) or Fortress. Whereas in AB III you have Myles dealing with walking away from his faith plunging into the void of despair and Tremonti pleading with him to not give up hope in \\"Words Darker than their Wings\\", in Fortress you have Myles still coming to grips with this to the point of building up a \\"fortress\\" and finally trying to tear it down by the end. I have heard the Fortress concept before in Pink Floyd's The Wall. It still isn't as optimistic as One Day Remains or Blackbird. I really wanted to like and buy Fortress, but lacked the incentive. Musically, there are some great riffs from Mark, but it doesn't really sound like the band is challenging themselves exploring other musical styles or pushing the envelope to create something new. They sound much more comfortable dishing out the same old heavy rock stereotypes. I've listened to the record 4 times and I am still waiting for it to \\"hit me\\". It might take the 20th or 30th listen. Who knows...
B007A4SDCG|4.0|I saw his interview with Oprah and decided I wanted to read his book.  This was enjoyable and enlightening.  I recommend reading this book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is by far my favorite app. Posting random pictures and creating boards that keep similar items together such as &#34;Cat Pictures&#34; is addictive. The app allows sharing, picture comments and group invitations to post pictures to similar boards. Its a world of treasures. 8 hours goes by in a flash!
B008QTV3X0|5.0|I was a big fan of the early seasons of '24' and I think this series takes it to another level.  Great story, great characters, great casting.  Pretty intense all around.  If you have an interest in this type of story: espionage, world events, overly dramatized plot twists, etc.... then you'd enjoy Homeland.
0375869026|5.0|It is good for a 5th grader, My Son likes this book  ,easy reading. and the TI calculator Easy to use.

B00AQ72RM6|5.0|I was pleased with the product. It was in very good shape for being used. My daughter was missing that season and was very happy with it.
067101756X|5.0|Excellent reading. Tells a lot about our government and coverups. The people that are sworn to secrecy. We are not a lone that is clear in this book and never have been. This book puts all the speculations to rest, as the truth is out there. People like Philip Corso that wrote this book just need to come out and tell the world of the real findings. Government coverup about UFO and the likes are so in grained into our everyday. Thank goodness America is waking up to the fact we are being fed lies by our own government. Wake up America. Great book to read, you draw your own conclusions.
B009ZW9DU2|5.0|An incredible journey between Bob and James.  I truly believe they were destined for one another.  I have enjoyed both of James's books and only wish he could write more.  He is a brave man to open his soul to so many about his journey recovering from drug addiction with Bob's help.  You won't regret reading this book.
0679720200|5.0|I had to buy this book for my college English class. I was definitely surprised by how amazing this book was. I couldn't put it down and read it in a day. I definitely recommend this book for people in and out of school.
B00ABLJ5NQ|4.0|The concept of the book was great as it is written as if it  is retelling what a person experienced as a child. There are no heroics for the boy which is a welcome change as other people help him because of the persons age and inexperience. The hints of the age of the people that befriend him and their fight on his behalf make for fun reading and it brings with it in some ways a small hint of reality in the fact that it shows the powerlessness of younger children in an adults world
B003W0BYQ4|5.0|I am a western move and a John Wayne fan. I have seen this picture many times but still enjoy watching it.
B009WUBERW|5.0|I'm a huge fan of everyone of the stars in this. The reviewers 1 staring this are taking this tongue and cheek movie waaaay to serious. The one liners and antics alone will tell you the stars themselves were not trying to project a master piece. This movie is for all the followers of favorite action hero Icons. Had they sat them all in a room watching a clock for 2 hours us diehards (No reflection on Mr. Willis lol) would have watched to the end. For those claiming it had no plot? The plot was simple and obvious. Mercenaries for hire out on a job. One of their team is murdered so they go after the guilty parties to exact revenge. The movie did not drag at all and pretty much had consistent action throughout. My only complaint is I wish it had been 2 hours longer. I guess Steven Seagal (whom I did enjoy in Above the Law, and his earlier movies) turned down a Cameo in the first Expendables one claiming he did not get along with the producer so who knows whether or not they even asked him about this one. He has been offered a role in Expendables 3. I know he had a long standing grudge with JCVD and I don't believe Stallone has him on any of his Christmas lists. Anyway enjoy the movie and watch it for what it is an action filled escape from reality with all your old movie star favorites. Wish Chuck Norris had a bigger part.
B00130EVSS|4.0|Great watch, a Russian Mob movie, very well written and produced. Liked it very much been out for awhile I've watched it several x's and I'll watch it again . Quite possible Viggo Mortensen's best movie ever. Easily worth every penny
B005PK56TA|5.0|Very good series! Kept us yearning to watch more even when we were dog tired from work! We're looking forward to watching the next season soon!
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|The game is okay, but becomes difficult after you get the first 5 or 6 characters and there are some aspects that do not work on my Kindle Fire (airplane portion) although it can be disabled.<br /><br />The song is probably the most addictive and has a good message.

B00F91RYL8|3.0|Good plot but I felt rushed through the movie was this a zombie, action family what kind of movie was this ? not really good
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Every Christian should read this book.  It deepens and confirms one's love of Jesus to place him properly in the historical context of his time.  It is not an easy read, but more than worth the time.  Exceptional historical research.
B0045HCJSK|5.0|One of the best John Wayne westerns made. The cast is one of the reasons this movie is so great. With Dean Marin, the late Ricky Nelson, Walter Brennan and Angie Dickinson. And Ward Bond. Him and John Wayne were the best of frinds'
B009LMTDL0|3.0|I guess I don't know what I was expecting as per this book it was alright I guess I just wasn't inspired or moved as per the suggestions given. her only advice appeared to be at very executive high levels, I did not feel as though it was one relatable to that of a lesser position. Sure you were supposed to be able to but every likening ad example was to that of a COO or CEO or someone of a very high status position so it didn't elicit alot of confidence in me personally, she didn't seem to know a single &#34;every day&#34;woman that I could relate to.

B00FRAUVOI|5.0|Modern family provides us with a humorous snapshot of the ever changing face of the modern family.  This show effectively helps us see love in action amongst a group of people with very different personalities.  We see couples, teens  and individuals working their way through life growing and learning along their  path.  The laughs keep coming with the underlying message of don't take yourself or your life so seriously.  This show encourages us to look on the bright side of life, even the less enjoyable but inevitable sides like starting a new job, first days of school, dealing with siblings, irate kids. relationship issues between husbands. wives lovers coworkers; you name it.  It is known  at the very least to put a smile on your face and at the most give you a good belly laugh.  Try it out you may just like being a people watcher like me!
B00CEJ2H6K|5.0|Continuing in the style which I've grown to love about Amon Amarth, Deceiver of the Gods adds another great album to the collection. The EP was a nice touch but more so as a novelty; nice to have but not really a work that stands on it's own.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|ONCE AGAIN KAY'S MOTLY CREW BUMBLES ALONG TILL THE CRIME IS SOLVED.<br />YES THE CHARACTERS ARE TIRESOME AND NEED TO DROP THEIR PERSONAL HANGUPS. THEY ARE GETTING OLD.  MARINO ESPECIALLY IS TIRINGLY FOUL MOUTHED WHICH IS  BORING AND LOONY LUCY ISN'T FAR BEHIND. THE CHARACTERS HAVE THE CAPIBILITY OF BECOMING DECENT HARDWORKING RRSPECTABLE TYPES THEN THEY OPEN THOSE SEWERS AND SPEAK.<br />NEVERTHELESS THE STORY WAS INTERESTING AND THE END, UNPREDICTABLE, WHICH AFTER YOU ARE HAVING TO SUFFER THROUGH CHARACTERS YOU WANT TO SHOOT IS A GREAT READ. KAY NEEDS TO RETIRE MARINO, LUCY NEEDS VALIUM IN MEGA DOSES AND BENTON NEEDS TO STOP BEING SO CALMLY  BENTON.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|For $35, it's the best thing in wireless HD streaming since, erm .. MK809 II PCTV dongle. The convenience of wireless streaming coupled with sturdiness of Google's software makes is all the more enjoyable. The minimalistic design of the box and the cheap device itself, is a treat to look at. Feels quite premium!<br /><br />BUT what makes it less than stellar are the (IMO unnecessary business/product) limitations imposed by Google on how and what could be streamed. I could not play my local AVI files through the Chrome browser (with Chromecast extension). MKV files played video without the audio. I'm sure there are other issues as well.<br /><br />Definitely a deal breaker for those looking to replace their existing dongles or WDTV's for local video playback. However, since this little monster packs lot of power in terms of its Hardware, I'm hopeful of Google will sooner or later remove these irritants to make Chromecast what it really should be - a truly inexpensive, truly multimedia, portable device.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|however, I wasn't all that impressed with the story or the acting.  It seemed flat to me.  The tricks were neat, though.

1401942601|5.0|I have quite a few oracle decks and do readings professionally. This deck has become one of my favorites.  I love the brilliant flower images and the messages are clear and concise for people new to readings.

It helps me to get additional information for my clients and is perfect when I am doing readings for myself.

B00CHVJODE|5.0|I bought this for my daughter and family in the UK for a present. It doesn't come out in the UK until December. The grandchildren don't know I'm sending it, they have been playing or have seen a Croods computer game, they love, so they are bound to like the movie.<br /><br />I watched the movie first before sending, it was good, I really enjoyed it, but I don't think it's quite as good as the &#34;Tangled&#34; movie I sent a couple of years ago, they really loved that one. They've just bought a larger TV, it's going to look great on it. I'm waiting for my little TV to break down before I purchase a large screen TV. The colors and animation are fabulous.
B0076HNMU0|4.0|I have really enjoyed watching this series, I am currently watching the second season.  It was suspense and drama and the characters are great.  I have had a lot of fun remembering how it was in the 80's and the styles back then.

B006OFN0SE|5.0|Anybody who knows me at all probably knows that I'm a big Clint Eastwood fan - though I have never been and all-worshiping one. Clint's stumbled plenty of times in his long career, and he's quite capable of turning out a film that leaves me cold (see both \\"Changeling\\" and \\"Trouble With the Curve\\" among recent films that didn't do it for me). And though the story on this one was certainly interesting, I can't say I've been super-impressed with Leonardo DiCaprio up to this point. The reviews in general weren't so great, but many of the comments from reviewers and friends I trust have been better. And then again, I loved \\"Hereafter\\", which also got mixed responses. So...cautious optimism going in, at best.<br /><br />So I'm pleased to report that \\"J. Edgar\\", though it certainly isn't perfect and has a few significant problems, succeeded far beyond my expectations. If DiCaprio never gives another great performance in his career, he should be remembered for his thoughtful, enormously emotional and painful portrait of this rigid, more-tightly-wound-than-should-be-possible, permanently adolescent autocrat. The Hoover created by the actor, director, and screenwriter Dustin Lance Black is unquestionably a closeted gay (or bisexual) man, let's get that out of the way first; but he is the product of a conservative God-fearing mother, a society in which there's only one acceptable kind of sexuality and behavior, and he's ambitious and needs to be in power and control of everything, including himself. The film manages one of the most difficult feats imaginable - creating a thoroughly unpleasant and largely amoral character, and then proceeding to make him likable and sympathetic - something which will I'm sure be a turn-off for many viewers who either want a straight-arrow Hoover or a simple villain. This isn't anything like either, but rather a small, hypocritical and fearful man who can only find love in his work and an apparently sexless companionship with his closest lieutenant; someone who acts out of the pettiest of spites and ruins lives - because as a hollow shell of power surrounding a void of fear and self-doubt it's the only thing he can do to make a life for himself. Controlling and spying on others becomes his way to live the life he can't let himself have, so it's no wonder that spying on sex lives and an obsession with race (the rumors of Hoover's partially African origins are explored only slightly and rather subtly here) become defining characteristics.<br /><br />The film proceeds mostly in the form of flashbacks, as an aged Hoover recounts his triumphs to a series of stenographers in the 1960s, taking credit for much of the work on the Lindbergh kidnapping case, and the victories against gangsters in the 1930s. We see early on how a 24-year-old Hoover becomes obsessed with finding new techniques to defeat crime, using fingerprinting and forensics before they became de rigeur, and starting his lifelong crusade against Communism at the same time. One idea the film explores over and over is that the man always wanted to simplify things - always believed in easy answers, in a black and white yes/no world, and this of course becomes a great irony when we look at his complex, deceit-filled private life; and he also, from the first, was a man willing to take credit for others' ideas. Even when it came to dress, Hoover the fashion-plate got his sense of style from his assistant/companion Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer, just as good as DiCaprio), and when he admires the fireplace in Attorney General Robert Kennedy's office, it's no surprise that we later see an identical model installed in his own.<br /><br />Much of the film is built on rhyming scenes like the Kennedy one, sometimes several minutes or an hour or more apart, sometimes built as abrupt transitions, such as an elevator ride taken by the elderly Hoover and Tolson that ends with the 30-year-younger pair getting off the same elevator. Far from being just cinematic flash (not really something Eastwood is known for), these serve to emphasize the lifelong metastasis of the man - 48 years in the same job, living with his mother until her death, keeping the same office for virtually his whole career. 48 years, and though the powerful man is old and withered, he is at the end in almost the same place he began, frozen by his own fears and secrets and emptiness. Three times we see him look out his window, past the Capital, down Pennsylvania Avenue, and we hear cheers - but they are not for him. These scenes reminded me of the way in which Sergio Leone told \\"Once Upon a Time in America\\", and in fact there's a moment early on in \\"J. Edgar\\" where Eastwood's music seems to quote Morricone's score for that film, just for a second. It could be a coincidence, but whether it is or not, both films at their hearts are films of regret and unrequited love over decades of a lifetime, and both are, at the end, almost unbearably sad.<br /><br />I do have some issues with the film; though they aren't major for me I suspect both might be bigger problems for others. One is the cinematography; it's by Eastwood's regular DP Tom Stern, and it's mostly in that muted washed out look that we also saw in \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" (where I thought it was pretty appropriate) and even moreso in \\"Letters From Iwo Jima\\". I suppose in a way it reflects the bleak, colorless world that Hoover lived in, emotionally, but it often just looked dull to me. I wondered at first if it was the poor projection when I saw it theatrically, but having seen the film now again on DVD, it remains an issue for me. The second area is the period of young Hoover's life; it would I think help strengthen the story, the character, if there was a little more exploration here; then again, one gets the sense that Hoover had little nostalgia beyond his powerful love for his mother (Judi Dench), and little interest in or patience for children (except when they could help his image, as a brief photo-op with Shirley Temple attests). His life was the FBI, and so perhaps it is appropriate that that's what we see of it, and even Tolson, and Hoover's career-long faithful secretary Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts - fine, though the role isn't as much as it perhaps could be) are often just sprockets in that mechanism.<br /><br />A lot of people obviously are disliking this; it's a very divisive film for both those who hate Hoover the autocrat (too sympathetic) and those who admire him but don't want to deal with his (possible) sexuality.  And there are always complaints about Eastwood's un-flashy style, and about DiCaprio.  And of course, being a film about real history, any liberties taken will be too many for a lot of folks. Too bad I say. What the filmmakers have crafted here is both a sad portrait of a fairly pathetic - if very powerful - man, and one of cinema's great stories of unrequited, repressed love.  Whether it is \\"real\\" or not seems beside the point to me; the emotional power of the film resides in what is on the screen, not on what we think we know about the real people who we're seeing in artistic reflection and imagination.ot really something Eastwood is known for), these serve to emphasize the lifelong metastasis of the man - 48 years in the same job, living with his mother until her death, keeping the same office for virtually his whole career. 48 years, and though the powerful man is old and withered, he is at the end in almost the same place he began, frozen by his own fears and secrets and emptiness. Three times we see him look out his window, past the Capital, down Pennsylvania Avenue, and we hear cheers - but they are not for him. These scenes reminded me of the way in which Sergio Leone told \\"Once Upon a Time in America\\", and in fact there's a moment early on in \\"J. Edgar\\" where Eastwood's music seems to quote Morricone's score for that film, just for a second. It could be a coincidence, but whether it is or not, both films at their hearts are films of regret and unrequited love over decades of a lifetime, and both are, at the end, almost unbearably sad.<br /><br />I do have some issues with the film; though they aren't major for me I suspect both might be bigger problems for others. One is the cinematography; it's by Eastwood's regular DP Tom Stern, and it's mostly in that muted washed out look that we also saw in \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" (where I thought it was pretty appropriate) and even moreso in \\"Letters From Iwo Jima\\". I suppose in a way it reflects the bleak, colorless world that Hoover lived in, emotionally, but it often just looked dull to me. I wondered at first if it was the poor projection when I saw it theatrically, but having seen the film now again on DVD, it remains an issue for me. The second area is the period of young Hoover's life; it would I think help strengthen the story, the character, if there was a little more exploration here; then again, one gets the sense that Hoover had little nostalgia beyond his powerful love for his mother (Judi Dench), and little interest in or patience for children (except when they could help his image, as a brief photo-op with Shirley Temple attests).

B002GHHHKG|5.0|I am  replacing the copy I already own on VHS. I love this movie and bought the soundtrack just so I could listen to the wonderful music.
1781162646|4.0|I read this on vacation at a cabin on a lake. It was short  and sweet. Not as detailed as King's usual efforts but a good story. Even in such a short book he develops characters you care about.<br />A good 3 day weekend read. I recommend it.
B001JQM7TG|5.0|The book was easy to follow, step by step. Able to reread if needed to. Price was right. Can't go wrong.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|Great Movie. Lots of action. Just seemed that there were scenes missing.  Jumped over parts too fast. Would recommend movie to my friends
B00003CXRM|5.0|I am replacing the copy I already own VHS. I also bought the sound track on CD for my Zoon.

B003F3NDWG|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Castle but I've been going in order of the seasons and I have to say they just keep getting better. This season is funnier and even better than the last, and I'm sure the next one will be better than this one!
B00DQR26EC|5.0|This game is perfect! I purchased Doom &amp; Destiny last night, so I've played it for around two hours so far and it is already won a place in my heart right next to Final Fantasy Tactics, Final Fantasy IV and Kingdom Hearts, this game share some gameplay mechanics with FF IV, everything works wonderfully sometimes the movement can be bothersome but not often and not a big bother, the storyline is charming, everyone you talk to has something to say the only people that share text are guards, a lot of the text is hilarious, I laughed so hard in the first hour I had to put the game down and will away to catch my breath and let my side recover. I highly recommend this game, it is worth 10 times the cost. I also recommend purchasing Avernum escaping the pits (or something like that) and swapping between the two they complement each other well and they are both amazing games!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Sweet! I had started watching this series back when it first began, but had lost track since. I'd forgotten what a well-made show it is. And as a bonus, Anna Torv (AKA Olivia Dunham) is smoking hot! And she pulls off an American accent very nicely, even though she is an Australian. The character of Walter Bishop, portrayed by actor John Noble (another Australian) is, to use the actor's own description, deliciously insane. If you enjoy science fiction with a well put together blend of action and drama, then I highly recommend Fringe. My hat's off to J. J. Abrams and company.
B00ET47USI|2.0|I foiund this App very difficult to use on my Kindle..In fact it locked it up and I had to reboot. I finally turned off the animation and voice components. I would not but nor recommend it to anyone.
031623480X|5.0|As a PhD in medical anthropology (Harvard) I can confirm that Dr. Perlmutter's statements are based on sound evolutionary science. Prior to the invention of agriculture (10,000 years ago), humans rarely ate grains. Grains would have been considered \\"starvation food\\" by paleolithic people, that would only be consumed if nothing more nutritionally dense was available. Grains are not naturally nutritious. Wheat flour has to be \\"enriched\\" because it carries so few natural nutrients. Without added vitamins, flour is just empty calories. Grains only became known as \\"health food\\" because of clever advertising by the agricultural industry. The food that allowed modern humans (Homo sapiens) to evolve their large brains was meat and animal fat.
B00BFBSV72|5.0|It is really awesome but it crashes when I open it for some reason. I can't wait till sonic dash comes but please fix the crash because it was an awesome game.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Love SwiftKey. Have been using it for a couple of years and rely on it more than any other app.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I like true history in my books. I found this story somewhat disturbing from the truth of it. It left me wanting to learn more about the existance of the Orphan Train and the Orphans who were sent on it. I will do more research on the subject,
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Great for the family, my daughter is obsessed with super hero's.  We all got to enjoy a good movie that was not a cartoon.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game is a great stimulant for the brain. It is also good because it is not a constant play. You have to take a break to earn energy. I thoroughly enjoy it.<br />I also enjoy the detail in the pictures.

B00DVPN30A|4.0|While Amos Lee has always mixed his blues with a healthy dose of folk music, \\"Mountains of Sorrow, Rivers of Song\\" sounds like his folkiest album yet. There's still plenty of blues, like the vocal of \\"Stranger,\\" but the backing of banjo belies the new folk underground running through this album. Then there's the backward guitar solo. Lee is having his cake and eating it. He approached this a bit on \\"Mission Bell,\\" singing with the likes of Willie Nelson should have made that point obvious, but now it's more forward.<br /><br />His brand of roots rocking is a potpourri of styles, and Nashville, where Lee and his band recorded \\"Mountains of Sorrow,\\" weighs in heaviest this time. His guests magnify the area code as well, with Alison Krauss on \\"Chill In The Air\\" and Patty Griffin on the title track adding some high lonesome harmonies. But it's not all - to take from the album title - rivers of sorrow. The Dylan-esque and playful \\"Tricksters, Hucksters and Scamps\\" shows a sense of humor. Nor is Lee afraid of the new technology with the keyboard heavy \\"Loretta,\\" and the horns that funk up \\"The Man Who Wants You.\\"<br /><br />I like \\"Mountains of Sorrow\\" just a tad less than I enjoyed \\"Mission Bell\\" (which I rated 5 stars in a previous review). But with his soulful voice delving still in the blues and folk elements that he's so good with, Amos Lee's \\"Mountain of Sorrow, Rivers of Song\\" is a solid album from a man who does Philadelphia (and this time, Nashville), proud.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin makes history come alive in this book.  Unlike many history-related books this book is lively, personal and also full of facts and background.<br /><br />All-in-all - this is one of the most enjoyable books I have read in many years!
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Great spin on the ccg format -- gorgeous artwork, smooth animation and fairly intuitive controls = a free game into which I'm likely to pump some cash
B008ROF114|5.0|John Wayne is always good..  Good supporting cast also. Very entertaining and light with good clean humor.  Would have no problem recommending it to anyone.
B00B49GSQQ|4.0|The best thing about this disk (for me) is it's got English subtitles.  For the first time in years I can understand what they're saying.  And what they're saying is important, since it explains why all the murders are happening.  It's a proto-slasher (one of the Friday the 13ths actually appropriated one of the killings), but unlike the slasher film, the characters are killed because of the rights to an important piece of real estate (the bay of the title), not for wanting and/or having sex.  Well, except for the quartet of hippies that shows up just to raise the body count.  That and to inject some nudity into the proceedings.  (Brigitte Skay goes for a swim, finds a body, jumps out and after a moment or two finally puts on  her green velvet minidress -- a particularly unfortunate choice of wardrobe, since Ms. Skay is a big...girl, and the dress makes her look even more strapping.)  There's some nice photography (to be expected in Bava's pictures), the killings are inventive, and a mjajor plus is Stelvio Cipriani's score. He came up with an absolutely gorgeous &#34;Bay Theme&#34; that could be a reworking of a classical piece (there are echoes of Schumann and Rachmaninoff) but works nonetheless.  The only thing wrong with the score is the final cut, a hideous Euro-pop &#34;la-la&#34; number.  I'm really glad to have this disk; I only wish Kino had released it under it's alternate title, Twitch of the Death Nerve....
B00079FUI6|5.0|Love it! Perfect condition :) this was a great purchase. I could not be more happy with my first season!
B003BW0CB6|5.0|i have been reading the series with Mickey Haller.  It ties all the characters in each book so you feel you already know them.  The story line has a great build up and keeps you hooked.
B00E0SX118|3.0|It's very good and entertainment I really enjoy it, it's good for kids but also parents can enjoy the movie
0316078913|3.0|'[Y]ou don't want to see a Santa undress.' I'm not sure the naked David would be particularly appealing either, and  - here's the clincher - maybe not the clothed one either. I have one question. Do gays like him? Or does he only appeal to the self-hating kind of gay? He is occasionally lovable. In SantaLand Diaries, from his first book Barrel Fever, when, asked why he wanted a particular truckdriving job, he says 'because I like the brown uniforms', and when, as Santa's helper, he has to resist the urge to say to a waiting child 'I know a lot of people who would kill for that little waistline of yours'. Mostly, though, the bile takes the breath away. Take the mother in Santa's grotto. \\"Goddamn it, Rachel, get on that man's lap and smile or I'll give you something to cry about.. Now, let's get the hell out of here. Your mother has a headache that won't quit until you're twenty-one.\\" I'm afraid 'ice' just sums this up. Most painful of all is the thought that someone might find it funny. We've heard of the closing, the dumbing down of the American mind. Other cultures will also have remarked the coarsening. America, take care they are not laughing AT you. I foresee rough seas ahead
B006PIXKVW|4.0|Nicely acted and directed modern take on an old Shirley Temple vehicle. The art production reproduced the era nicely and the actors portrayed their parts well.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Brilliantly acted and highly suspenseful thriller. Keeps you on the edge of your seat continually. The suspense level is so high that it is difficult to watch more than one episode at a time.

I love her no-nonsense approach and all her quotes and anecdotes.<br />I was 24 hours into healing a right knee injury when I went to my Ortho appt and was embarrassed to find nothing really wrong with my knee.

B00BVMXBDO|5.0|Really liked this series and can't wait for the second season. The characters are well written and each chapter leaves you wanting to find out what is going to happen next. Admittedly there some holes in the plot, however the storyline is strong enough to carry it all forward. Enjoy the ride!
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|I read the book by David Mitchell and it was spectacular! Such brilliant writing. I laughed, I cried, I burned with the message of tolerance and humanity. So I thought I'd love the movie, because it was, after all, about tolerance and re-incarnation, and how we create our own lives through our thoughts and actions...very Buddhist stuff.<br /><br />I was so taken aback from the movie's divergence from that marvelous writing that still echoed in my soul. I didn't like the movie. So I put it aside and watched another month of sci-fi schlock...<br /><br />The second time I watch the Wachoski (sp?) Siblings version of Cloud Atlas, I was moved. I laughed, I cried. It's a marvelous, nuanced movie, and a lot of care was taken to be faithful to the book...in the language of cinema. Which is different. And this time I got it and loved it. Cloud Atlas, along with Oblivion are the two best sci-fi movies out this year on Blu-ray. They're deep and so well done. Bravo.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Although I do not like the premise of children fighting to the death for food, this story is actually about the effects of was on children,  I found it difficult to put it down. The descriptions are exquisite. Now, I'm on book two because I want to find out how the government continues their torture..
B008220C56|1.0|I could hardly wait for this movie to come out on BRay. Then I could hardly wait for it to be over. Joe Wright did such an amazing job on Pride and Prejudice I was eager to see how he handled this Tolstoy masterpiece. He flupped it completely. Nobody cares that you're a theatre buff, Mr. Wright! If I want a play I'll go see one. I wanted a MOVIE, with all the bells and whistles this deserved: sweeping Russian landscapes, an exploration of relationships that drive people toward their personal destinies. The costuming was good, but it was so disconcerting to be suddenly backstage or to watch sets revolve around the characters. It pulled you completely from the moment. I want to be immersed in a movie, to be there, like it's happening to me because I identify with the character. This mannerist movie-play disrupted my ability to believe. It was awful.

B00A81NFAS|5.0|I've seen it twice now, and it just got better and better. I've lived with bi-polar people and this movie tells the truth, but so light-heartedly and lovingly. The best rom com I've seen in years. Bradley Cooper was awesome and Jennifer Lawrence is beautiful and talented. They were so believable and touching. Love this movie!
B00005JPD0|5.0|I love Denzel Washington in any movie he is in.  I would buy all movies staring Denzel. He is a great actor.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|This was the season we missed, and I was glad to be able to get up to speed on the series. The story is like watching a train wreck, all the time wondering how in the world the producers were going to finished the story.
B00F8H0LM2|1.0|Glitches very badly.  The screen has blocks that pop up.  Looks like an old Nintendo game that is going bad.  I erased it from my sysmtem.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Very good book for discussion to see what you would do if placed in the same situation. Will recommend to my book groups to share. Look forward to discussions.
B00FEX1AA2|5.0|Love movies like this that scare you and make you wonder as well. Would tell people to watch it but best if it is seen in the dark.
B00BYM5I1O|5.0|It's a shame that all country radio djs are just too gutless to play what's really good, instead they just do as they are told.<br />So you will have to buy this to hear it. So buy this great cd and turn your radio off.
B0000524E5|5.0|Thanks for having this movie available for me to buy. My daughter really loves this movie and I bought it for her.

B005LJK3AC|1.0|This is less than low brow comedy.  How this script attracted such big names to the cast is a mystery.<br />All in all, I'm sorry I made the purchase and wish I could get my time and money back.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|Thank you for making this movie available for me to buy. I purchased it for my grankids and the really liked it.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Great to play. It doesn't seem to have very many glitches. It is challenging and it is a lot of fun to play
B0050N8N0Q|2.0|This album has more electronic riffs than I like in my music.  I really only like the main song that has garnered radio play
B00CHVJODE|3.0|what I liked about it was how hard the story showed it was for cave people to get a meal. That said, they all were so healthy and got so little to eat, no idea how they survived. The dad's extremely cautious nature explains why they weren't eaten by other predators, but story didn't show them as successful enough hunters to maintain their body weight. Liked the dad, mother in law dynamic which I found believable.

B0051MKMNC|5.0|This movie is an absolute rush! And thought provoking. Bradley Cooper has proven his range in acting and this movie really showcases it. One of my fav movies, probably of all time.

B0080SZ0V8|4.0|When I first played this app, it was on a Motorola Xoom tablet.  And I had numerous problems with it -- crashes, hangs, etc.  However, after I got my Galaxy S4, I thought I'd give it another try -- and it runs just fine there.  The Xoom is running Android 4.1.1, and the S4 is running Android 4.2.2.  Both are fairly &#34;uncustomized&#34; interfaces (and, in fact, the Xoom is virtually &#34;clean Google&#34;, since it was supplied directly by them).  Never did find out the problems, but when it's running, it's quite a good game.<br /><br />I have a little trouble with the fact that every section of the game is timed -- and I'm a &#34;relaxed&#34; game player.  I don't like to feel pressured, especially when playing &#34;brain games&#34;.  The good news is that if you miss a level because the timer ran out, you just start that level over.  (And most likely will be able to play more quickly through the sections you've already finished, giving more time for the rest.)
B005BRS8Z6|1.0|You will need a massive amount of suspension of disbelief to read this book. Over and over again the author quote \\"facts\\" that contradict science severely, such as: stars are made out of light (doesn't he understand about fusion reaction?), or human is the only living species with a language (chimpanzees and dolphins are known to have languages as well). The four agreements make some sense, but the author's total lack of credibility makes this book an absolute joke.<br />Fortunately Amazon has a return policy so I can just get my money back, awesome!
B00BEJOMIW|5.0|The older version is much better than the new version.  Stayed much closer than to the book. Like new condition. Fast shipping.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|Nice game, lots of fun. The graphics, sound & controls are very good. Works well on both my Galaxy S4 and my son's Galaxy S.
B004GYY714|5.0|I was looking for an app that would let me listen to live streaming radio stations.  I have other apps for when I want to listen to &#34;genres&#34; of music pulled from a music library -- apps like Pandora, and even iHeartRadio.  But many of the other apps don't do live streaming -- or don't do it well.<br /><br />I often base my initial satisfaction with an app on how quickly I can open the app for the first time and get to what I want to do.  When I installed TuneIn Radio, it was because I wanted my favorite local FM station -- WDAV, a 24/7 Classical music station -- available when I was not at/near an FM radio.  I was up and running, listening to the station in just a minute or two.  That's &#34;ease of use&#34;.
0307951529|5.0|I had always loved the idea of becoming an entrepreneur and a friend had suggested this book so while on vacation for a week I read it and that's all I needed. After a few weeks of finding my niche I started a website. Although it hasn't been up for very long I've enjoyed the process of at least taking the steps towards becoming independent in my future.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|I have been watching this film with my son since he was six months old.  It's never gotten boring or tedious to watch with him.  Even when we watch it on repeat for hours. The music can carry me through my day and the visuals keep him attentive. Also, how freaking cute is the concept of a robot love story?
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|Chris if you don't make a part three I will be so sad your work is amazing don't stop ever!!
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I've installed a handful of &#34;flashlight&#34; apps, and I think that Flashlight HD LED is the best.  I would also guess that each user's satisfaction will be somewhat dependent on the device they're using.  My Galaxy S4 has an incredibly bright LED; so when I  use it as a flashlight, it works perfectly well -- as good as any small flashlight.  However, I can see that it would be awkward (or unsatisfactory) trying to use it on a tablet, or a device without a really bright LED.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|There is another Uno app out there that is horrible - but this one is awesome!!  I love playing it.  You do need to wait 30 mins after using up your credits to gain more, but the game play is so fun that it's worth it!
B004LQI0HE|1.0|Terrible movie. Nothing like the book. Very jumpy, not smooth transitions between scenes. The description doesn't fit the movie. Don't watch
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|This device is great for casting youtube and netflix to your big screen tv. other than that it's worthless.<br />because most devices now has youtube and netflix app like playstation3, wii, xbox, smart tv, etc. so what's the need for chromecast?<br />i try to cast a live streaming from a website and i hate how chromecast perform, i believe it's still on beta, so i'm hoping google will make it worth to have.
B007TKT2SK|4.0|This app is definitely targeted to a very specific audience -- mostly younger grade-schoolers who are working on the concept of fractions for the first time.  For that audience, this is a great app.  Simple interface, and really helpful.  I picked it up because it was the FAOTD.  In my case, I graduated with a BS in Mathematics, so it really was just a &#34;passing fancy&#34;.
B000V5Y1SQ|4.0|Love the DSN series, they interwove it well with the TNG series- the characters are not fully developed in season 1 of course, but still excellent series
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|Very good disc! Strong songs from start to finish.. best album to date! A must have for any fan! A++
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is a very simple but effective device that does exactly what it says it does.  It's features are minimal however the price is so low that it's hard to find fault with this device.  I bought two and have both of them powered off built in USB ports which is great since if I had to connect this to an outlet I'd have reduced the star rating by at least one.  Rumors are that more services will be added beyond the current Youtube, Google Play and Chrome browser and this will make this even more useful.
B00AKO93JK|3.0|I saw this as a FAOTD, and thought I'd pick it up.  It's actually not a bad app -- and it includes videos that not only help with the exercises, but also define the &#34;timing&#34;.  I.e., you can exercise along with the instructor.  But that, in itself, is strange -- especially if you're running this on a phone -- because it's not convenient to go back and forth between your exercises and your device.  And I have difficulty &#34;getting into&#34; a good solid exercise regime.  I think this would be a good app for folks that can; it just didn't &#34;click&#34; with me.

B00DDXJRJG|4.0|A pretty nice volume EQ, and easy to use.  I happen to have a tablet and a phone that already have good volume and EQ control apps, so it doesn't really provide me a lot that's new.  However, for users who are looking for such an app, this one is quite good.
B004LROUNG|4.0|As usual for a Grisham book, well written and suspense filled. I would highly recommend reading this one. It provides suspense, drama and features a realistic story line.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|A walk down memory lane. Super, even if you aren't a diehard fan. Great history on an iconic group. Plus the Eagles have aged well!

B005BOHYW2|4.0|I gave it 4 stars, because I'm reading it again.<br />It shows how ineffectual the adoption and foster care system is.<br />And it gives you an enormous amount of information about the meaning of the flowers and how believing in something can change your life.
B008PZZYB2|3.0|Some laughs in the complete absurdity of activity. Lots of famous faces. Shows foolishness of smoking near gasoline fumes. Lots of silly/ugly posing and 'fashion'.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|i was thoroughly unimpressed by this book with it's undeveloped characters and totally expected plot lines.  this is no epic adventure.
B0001907DA|5.0|What is so great about this series is the fact that you have a wide range of charectors to draw comedic situations from
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|The story line was cute. I definitely wouldn't put this in the Erotica section which is where I found it.

B004EPYZSK|5.0|A must see movie. Very believable. I liked the story line very much. Very original.<br />I recommended this to all my family and friends.
B003B2C92G|3.0|When an assassin is trying to get out of his line of work, he is set up by his employer who has a contact from lets say the negative side of the afterlife. HE maikes a deal with the guy in charge to come back to the living world. He eventually is given a superpowered suit to lead the army of the dead. (spoiler alert) a man who also made that deal years ago but got out of it shows the main charector that he can fight against evil with the suit he was given
B005LAIIGW|5.0|I finally got to see the movie, and I thought it was amazing. For those people who want to shoot holes in it because the character's hair did not float as it would in space .. give me a break. They can't film in space!!! Are you daft? Yes, you have to suspend some things you know to be true. It's called entertainment. Seriously, if you are that picky don't go to the movies. You will find fault in most of them. For the rest of us who are able to enjoy a good movie, I have to say this one was stunning. If you do see it, I would highly suggest you see it in 3D. The shots are stunning, and the film had me so involved I was trying to help the character. I want this movie in my library, and as soon as it is available I want to see this again. Though, sadly, I will have watch in 2D. I don't have that nice of a TV...
B00F8H0LM2|3.0|This is an okay game. It gives you a lot of characters to play as, plus you can get more with credits. But it Dosent have many levels to do. It only has a few and then your done. But over all its a good game.

B00AZNEW5G|4.0|This is another version of the operation that took Osama Bin Laden down!  It is well done and accurately portrayed as far as the facts that the public is privy to.  The action is a little slow in some places, but that is how covert ops REALLY go.  They are not all action, in real life!  The background is well documented and included in a logical way.  The tension builds dramatically!  Worth it!

B005DC68NI|5.0|I never realised how simple the fundamentals of digital publishing were. A great guide for the first timer. Thank you.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|These are really good headphones for the money.  The tonality is flat and uncolored.  Your sound equipment needs to bring your listening experience to your liking.  The headphones just follow suit, and do that extremely well.  I haven't yet heard them clip regardless of listening levels.  I enjoy all manner of music (minus rap and hip hop etc).  These headphones can do them all justice.<br /><br />If there is a con, it is that they will make you sweaty around the ears after a while.<br /><br />The very long cord that it comes with makes it easy for you to move about if you need to.  It also allows me to sit back on the couch and have them plugged into my computer while watching movies and music at sound levels that I enjoy without bothering my wife who has extremely good hearing......<br /><br />If you want earphones that do not color the sound that they are reproducing, and if your equipment supports any need for kicking bass etc, the AKG K 240 delivers!<br /><br />Bernie
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app... I have it on my kindle and my phone.  I can have my bible with me where ever I go and I have the choice of several different bibles at just the push of a button.  I love The Message but like to be able to Kings James too.

B004MC0FO8|5.0|I am always thinking what is the name of that song or I really like that song and this app lets me get the name of the song and the artist that recorded it.  It's great when you are watching a TV show and they are playing something in the background or at the end of a scene and you want that... I've gotten tons of great songs this way that otherwise I would never have heard of before.  LOVE IT!!
B001Q5395Q|4.0|This is a Classic 80's style horror flick!  If you love Jason, Freddy, Michael, and the rest of those...add a little cheesy comedy, and this is what you'd get.<br />It's corny in all the right ways!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a fun game for young and old. I got it for my child and now I play it with her<br />I wish I could jump faster or have some dressage in it too.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I have binge watched this entire series through Amazon Prime. In fact, the series is the reason I signed up for Amazon Prime.  I do a good volume of shopping through Amazon, but this series sealed the deal. The video and audio quality have been perfect, and any device I watch it on seems to know exactly where I left off and starts right up. Anyway, the series itself is great. Very well written, riveting, character driven.  My favorite character is still Kalinda, but Will has certainly had his share of grief and has been intriguing to watch emerge as a maturing but complex character.  If you have watched this show, you can't skip season four and hop on the season five bandwagon. You must tune in!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I like this puzzle, the one that I like the most is the stationary position, you really have to work hard to uncover all of the squares and sometimes, they hidden behind each other and you can't solve it.  It's a fun game to play when you are waiting for an appt....
B00FFRAKRG|3.0|It's definitely better than their last album.  The 2 good songs are Really good!!!<br />But the rest of the album is just filler...
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 because it was very slow, almost boring, in the beginning.  I know the background of the characters is important, but I felt this aspect was drawn out  too long.  I generally don't read books that involve a lot of violence, but I decided to go beyond my comfort level & read this.  If you don't like stories with violence, especially targeting youth, then I wouldn't recommend this book.  However, the plot & the characters moved quickly & became very suspenseful.  I like the fact that it touched on many themes (war, poverty, love, to name a few) and that it portrays what the U.S. could be like post mass destruction.  I found the end to be rather disappointing, however, it also motivated me to read Book 2 (currently reading).
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Fun game I hate that you have to give a review that is the only bad thing about it good game
B0073LWEXK|4.0|This game is a lot of fun  Hard to put down or pause it.  This one they do have clues when you get stumped  The graphics are really good and once you find something it doesn't close back up or hang up the game.  Loved trying to figure out the puzzles.  Always something new to learn.  Finished the puzzle in few hours.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|What a great movie!  Comedy, action, suspense, more witty banter!<br />Great cast with good acting!<br />Like a good magic trick, the twist at the end will leave you saying... I should've seen that!
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Highly recommended app you should buy if you are looking for an app to take videos and pictures on it is an awesome app.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|This is a story about war, but thats really the background for a bigger story about life, death, and life
B009NY43NY|1.0|The season really went downhill.  This book was full of filler like I went downstairs and made some chicken and we ate it and it was good and I went to sleep. Come on and get to the story. I didn't like the ending as well. Glad it was the last book but sorry the series ended so poorly.
B00DHNBPA6|3.0|It's not bad... But it definitely didn't do the original justice...<br />They need to stop re-making old classics... Hollywood is going to make a worse name for itself...
B003JUGQ38|5.0|I loved Season 4.  It had all the normal things to love about Doctor Who and David T. does a great job of acting.

B001NHNG64|5.0|Just like the first book, this one keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Hard to put down, definitely not the book to put you to sleep.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|Not bad, but not great... It wasn't a waste of 2hrs, but it was a goth chick-flick...<br />Just a witch version of Twilight...
B004VFN7BE|5.0|I have seen this movie time and time again and never seem to tire of it - the plot is interesting and unpredictable, the dialog is sensible and clever - I recommend this movie to anyone who tires of the boring predictable thrillers - you won't be sorry.
1582701709|5.0|this is a really great book.  It helps you become more positive. it really does contain a secret that we can utilize in life.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I would recommend the Jack Reacher series to anyone who likes action heroes.  Well written, fast paced and an easy read.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|Cool idea, but very drawn out.  The effects were amazing, the plot was good, the acting was great.<br />Only down side... Very long...
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I really liked John Green's subject matter - it involves a very special relationship between 2 young people.  he is so good at helping you feel what they are feeling.
B003NS2T9G|1.0|I was excited to watch a high class series; the cinematography was great (as are most British series), but too many expletives (the worst type) in just the first few scenes of the first episode. I stopped watching without finishing.<br /><br />Too bad the producers didn't think to keep it classy all the way around.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Best game ever I have 5epic dragons and they even have guides for it this is sooo fun I reccomend this for anyone.

0312360266|1.0|Once upon a time, I gave this book a five-star rating. After doing a re-read this past week, I'm wondering why I ever gave it such a high rating. It definitely doesn't deserve it. Maybe I was just so enamored by vampire novels at that point that I thought anything with a little fang or a little blood was awesome. Obviously, I was wrong.<br /><br />As is typical with the young adult vampire novel, the heroine considers herself to be a freak and lives in some sort of broken home/recently remarried type situation. As is also typical, said heroine is having boy troubles. Apparently, vampire novel heroines are always having some kind of heartache/heart-break issue. Maybe it's actually heartburn and they need some kind of acid reliever. Honestly, that would make more sense in a lot of cases within this genre.<br /><br />I was intrigued that the story dealt with segregation. Once teenagers find out that they are vampyres, as they spell it in this book, they have to give up their old life and move into a special boarding school for other people who have been marked. I know that might sound a lot like Harry Potter, but instead of being just a tradition, this is something that seems to be legally required of newly marked. It is also apparent that this is different from the HP books in that the outside world knows about vampyres existing and they treat them as being lesser creatures because they are no longer human. (To be fair, the vampyres call humans 'refrigerators', so there really is no love lost.)<br /><br />Zoey Redbird, this novel's heroine and narrator, is a bit of a queen of exaggeration and immaturity. She says that she has limited math skills, but makes fun of her best friend's worse one when the friend exaggerates a number. It makes Zoey seem very haughty. It was the kind of attitude that you might see someone display right before someone punched them in the face. And she really has no right to be so, since, like I said, she's got some problems with immaturity. She uses words like \\"boobie\\" and \\"poopie\\" regularly. And she gets distracted whenever she thinks about those words. It's very annoying. She's also a hypocrite. She will ridicule someone else in one paragraph for a particular behavior and then turn around and do the exact same behavior just a few paragraphs later.<br /><br />Zoey and her friends like to partake in the hobby of slut-shaming. There was honestly more slut-shaming in this book than I was ever exposed to in high school. It was very alarming to see two female writers propagating the idea that girls who have sex or who enjoy being sexual in any way deserve to be treated with less respect and with continued ridicule. What does that teach the readers of these novels to think about sex and sexuality?<br /><br />Zoey also uses other ways of insulting people through slurs and stereotypes. Negative remarks that she makes about others often relate to the person's sex life or their body shape and size. And do not get me started on how Damien is described. Zoey actually mentions something about not hearing a lisp. And the story goes out of the way to make him seem like he's different from every other gay guy in the world. Instead of making the story seem more inclusive by having a gay character, it actually feels more like they're being even more ignorant and anti-LGBTQ. She calls another character a  \\"retard\\" and makes fun of friends of her stepfather as being \\"beady-eyed pedophile husbands\\". Both of these things disgusted me. There is even racist wording used to describe a fellow student's hair.<br /><br />I know that Zoey cannot and shouldn't be a perfect character. Flaws are what make characters great, but there's a point when it becomes obvious that it's more than just a flawed character--it's a flawed book. The writing quality of the book is poor. Before Zoey goes to the House of Night, there's a scene where her mother and stepfather are talking...and they seem to only talk in cliches. The mother actually makesa comment about \\"what will the neighbors say.\\" It was ridiculous. Throughout the book, it felt like the writers are trying really hard to be young and fresh. That was disconcerting to me because one of the authors is young enough that she shouldn't have had to try very hard to sound young. And, as I think I've pointed out by now, the book is filled with ignorance and bigotry. Instead of being an interesting story, it just comes across as disgusting.a comment about \\"what will the neighbors say.\\" It was ridiculous.

B007SGLZP8|2.0|This had good parts and others where the story dragged. Of all Grisham`s books I have read this had the most unlikely story line. This is the first Grisham book I would not recommend.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book will change your conventions about what it means to believe in something so strongly that you would die for it. Suprisingly in the pages of this book you see what true male friendship- real brotherly love is like.<br />Astounding book, all true.<br />I cried through the last chapter.
B0040I09RM|2.0|Too much violence and profanity for viewing.<br />I thought I would enjoy the series but I am not fond of having to view after bedtimes.
B00F56AZK4|4.0|I love putting these together. The time to do some of these are very hard. But there is lots of different levels to do.
B008476HBM|5.0|The language and the complexity of the story and the characters makes me want to read this again and again.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I've never hunted a day in my life, but am learning so much while playing this game. Love customizing guns and levelling up
B008TTPQXA|5.0|Proof of Heaven was just a confirmation of my own beliefs and a few years ago we had a similar experience in our family.  I loved the book.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works just as expected. Perfect for YouTube parties no matter the mobile platform you use :). Tab sharing allows to watch videos much more than just from YouTube.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Another great installment in the Jack Reacher series by Child. Good story twists and action. The lead character is great and you can't help but root for him!
B00CW665VI|5.0|Refreshing and amazing!! Loved reading from a guys perspective. I laughed and I even teared up...Drew would be so disappointed in me! fabulous read and I can't wait to read more from Emma Chase!!!
B004DLPXAO|1.0|This app is now crashing on my LG MS840.  Sounds like many other users are complaining of this problem.  How can just download a previous version?
B000E1YVZU|5.0|This is a favorite of mine, it always has been. I absolutely love the soundtrack and the amazing acting that is in this film. It's great, and a good one to watch on a rainy night, curled up with a blanket and a bowl of popcorn.
B00594XOZU|3.0|My phone broke months ago and I'm still earning money to buy a new one, not everyone has a Facebook or one of those social media websites. So Kik was great for me and my friends to talk to, until now, every time  I try to log in it says something like &quot;error, try again later&quot;. Uninstalled it a few times to, still nothing. This needs to be fixed now.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|one of the best movies i have seen hope number two is just as good looking to adde to my collection
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show really has not disappointed.  I feel that the third season of a large majority of show can sometimes be the toughest, in the case of The Walking Dead....it has exploded into a whole new territory of awesome.  The character development is amazing in this season, every episode of each season has seen new obstacles but I really feel the emotion comes through and my heart really weeps for the characters.  I really forget about the actors the set's the camera and everything, this show really grabs you in and delivers each time, in season three you really see how after time what issues a group of humans trying to stay together in a zombie apocalypse would face.  I haven't regretted any episode purchased on amazon and am likely to buy more in the future.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|This is the greatest show in the series.  I would like to have them leave it running it was fantastic
B000FC2L1E|5.0|She weaves her story without missing a stitch.  Can never put this series down and always start the next book within minutes.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Love this series!  It keeps you guessing and laughing most if the time.  Great story lines and fun characters make this a really worthwhile series.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|The visual effects in this movie were really well done.  The story line was pretty cool, without giving anything away I have seen a similar story made before.  That being said I still think this movie was well worth the rental, I would have even paid to seen the film in the theatre, although I don't see myself watching this film over and over throughout the years and nothing about it really blew me away, again though, this was a good movie and well worth the watch.<br />Tom Cruise does a great a great job in the film, very typical Tom Cruise action hero role for him.  Small role for Morgan Freeman but his delivers his quintessential Morgan Freeman speech and looks cool in the movie.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|This is my favorite of all the Jane Austen oeuvre. It is simple, direct, modest yet passionate, and follows closely the novel from whence it sprang. Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds are excellent in the lead rolls of Anne and Captain Wentworth, and really the whole cast matches them in ability and subtlety.
B00FF56IR4|2.0|When I heard that Joss Whedon's inspiration for this series was a certain Buffy episode (\\"The Zeppo\\"), I was excited. Unfortunately, traces of Whedon's style: witty dialogue, interesting characters, unexpected twists, are hard to find here. Feels like the show has been dumbed-down for a mass audience. Just average - kind of like watching a bigger budget version of Warehouse 13.<br /><br />Since this show has Joss Whedon's name associated with it, I must admit I had high expectations. Unfortunately, they weren't met. I loved the Avengers movie, but this show is just okay.<br /><br />After 3 episodes I have lost interest, which is sad because it certainly had the potential to be SO much better.
B00005MP58|5.0|Purchased this classic because I am a fan of Jane Austin, enjoy watching it. Costumes are correct for the period and the visual scenes are beautiful. Actors portray their characters perfectly
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|I mean look I feel when you watch a movie like this you pretty much know what you're getting into.  The acting is campy but really you shouldn't be expecting Oscar winning material to come from a G.I.-JOE sequel.  All this being said and the obvious perception of the film from the title and cover, it was a fun film to watch.  If you are one of those parents who is strict on their kids watching violence I would say be weary of this, but otherwise I have seen much worse acting and much worse films than this one.  If your bored and want to just kick back with a bowl of popcorn and watch something, you could do much worse than this film.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|It is a book that is hard to put down. Very entertaining beginning to the end. I highly recommend this book.
B004XQO90O|5.0|Wow, great show! Never heard of it until I saw it at a friends, then couldn't wait to order it! I'm pretty sure I was on my phone ordering it while the closing credits were rolling.
B000005RXH|5.0|I have always wanted this album and wished I had bought it while I was overseas as this particular cover was hard to find in the US. Supertamp has some pretty awesome music if you get into the progressive rock and rock genres. Some of their music could be classified as pop, but the early stuff like this is worth getting.
B00FEX1AA2|3.0|So I ended up buying and not renting this title because my girlfriend really, really wanted to see it when it became available.  As an avid fan of horror films I will say that I have seen much worse than this.  The movie has some very popular &#34;scares&#34; in it.  I won't give anything away but if you have seen the Insidious films you will find the similarities.  The movie is fun to watch, the acting is campy but in comparison to some other horror films I have seen the acting is decent and the story is pretty good.  I won't get into a comparison between real life and the movie because that matter little to me when watching a horror film.  I would say definitely worth the rental, but I think I should have tried to wait it out.
B002X6PTH8|4.0|Great movie. Very funny. It's a good movie in the sense that it is silly and gives a few good laughs.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|Enjoyable, classic Lady Antebellum! This band is a sure bet for dependable music that one can look forward to coming up on a playlist. Timely and timeless.
B004EPZ034|5.0|We love the characters and the fact that Dave is more involved throughout the movie.  The villains make the movie dramatic, but there's great laughs and music!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This story grabbed me at the beginning and didn't let me go.  I was surprised the story line was soo good!  I had been told otherwise!  I recommended it to all my girlfriends, Who have either read or are reading all three.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|I, personally, do not like the fact that I am constantly being tracked so I try to avoid using it as much as possible.
B007HO392S|5.0|A great cd, Carrie Underwood has a beautiful, classy voice, full of passion and compassion. Whatever songs you buy this for will be complimented by the others on the disc. Very nice.
B00E8TVHBA|5.0|They watch it all the time, and we do, too.  Can't beat the value for HD quality and we can watch it almost anywhere.
B00B89LZ4C|4.0|super detailed and well made. It comes with a duffle bag of money and his famous revolver. The only this is that it came with the bottom opened and re-taped. That was also from amazon
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this is a great game to get lost in for hours of amazing simple yet challenging gameplay with jaws amazingly fun for all ages
B008B8AOQI|5.0|I bought this cd after hearing &#34;Let Her Go&#34; and wanting to hear more soul touching music of the same kind for melancholy moments of my crazy life. This is beautiful music, very expressive and compelling, embracing the listener as if they're a part of the musics tale.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Sometimes reality is just the wrong flavor and only the simpler purer rules of childhood need apply. Like Alice in wonderland?  This is your kind of book. Take a walk down this lane. Narnia is on the farm next door. With just a touch of Peter Pan or Gilbert  and Sullivan, leave your luggage on the curb it will wait for you and you won't need it for this trip.
B007EC27QM|5.0|needed a calculator on my kindle this is very useful, and easy to use. I recomend it.  Like it alot
B00FPGSPQU|2.0|Not worth the time.  Saw the first 2 and this one was made just for money or something.  Not even worth the rent price.
0770437400|4.0|I really enjoyed the story, but not the writing style.  I wish there had been more focus on individual characters
B00004RYQW|5.0|Great movie in German with English subtitles. Perfect viewing and sound quality. My students enjoy it immensely.  I highly recommend it to any German club.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I disliked this book because it was B O R I N G! The plot was boring and they never introduced the characters.  There was about 999,999,999,999 characters. There was _no theme or plot. I think all the author tried to do was to put words on a page and define them. Over all it was stupid.
B0060CXN2O|5.0|This was one of my favorite movies as a child.  Love having it in my collection now...great movie! Fun to re-watch!
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Free portable RPG with some pretty sweet graphics.<br />Aside from, in the &quot;shop&quot;, the lack of regular game coin items, and the inability to rotate or adjust the view, it is totally worth it. Do wish there was a version that was a paid application, where you only pay once for the app, and the content is free. But, even with my cons, I still play this game almost everyday, so you can imagine that it must be freaking awesome to play, and you would be right... because it is freaking awesome!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This app is amazing. It always gives me a good chance to think while I'm having fun. They are pretty challenging so watch out. I love this app.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|such a fun game<br />I love you actually play this game without spending money or have to wait for energy to build back up... keep up the good work gameloft
B00AB7HESI|4.0|ok I love the game so I bought all the levels and was playing and finished level 7 and then all the levels I bought disappeared! PLEASE FIX THE GLITCH!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Another incredible story by Stephen King!  I found it impossible to put down, never a slow or yawning chapter!  Thanks for yet another thrilling journey into your imagination Mr. King!
B000UZPIAW|4.0|Nikki Sixx was nuts and this is well worth reading. You have heard of crazy rock and roll stars doing crazy things but this the truth about how amazing, scary, and sad life at the top is. It is a complete emotional roller coaster that is a blast to read.
B00B7ERH04|1.0|What kind of an idiot makes up CAMCOINS? Thats what i want to know. I bought this app thinking &quot;Thank the lords they made a camera with a PAUSING button.&quot; So I took my first video for YouTube, and I had fun with it. Then i decided to make another video. So I hit the play button and it says, &quot;could not complete the action&quot;  it told me that if I wanted to make another video I would need 10 camcoins. Why would you charge someone to make a video. It's stupid. I hope you take my advice and NOT get this app if you are looking for a camera with pausing button. I also hope that the creators of this thing so called app reads my review and does something about it. Because if they don't, I think they are not going to get anymore customers
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|4 stars for stream, 5 for overall. I need more words, so...ummm I watched this season on a laptop and xbox, both had about the same quality of resolution.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|It was everything I was hoping it would be! I would definitely recommend this to all of my friends. Loved it!
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I just love Fun.'s sound. I heard a lot of their songs on Pandora and love all that I've heard. If you like Carry On and Some Nights you'll probably like the whole album.
B008VBYN80|5.0|Kingdoms and  lords is a game for the pc and tablet it is a kingdom game  the Dasin is pretty  good  it's glass 2d  and amazing  and the music is pretty good  it's is  middle ages  so good  and it  has rpg elements  and I love rpg games so I gave it a ten out of ten play it  it's a good game that it kappa out
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|This is a fun album to listen to on the road or around the house.  Most times that I put it on, I play through it a couple times, it is that enjoyable.  Train has never taken lyrics or music too seriously,(especially live) in that they keep things light and fun most of the time.  This is more of that style.  They vary the sounds and feels a good bit on the album while keeping their sound.  Most will enjoy a large percentage of the album!
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|Wasn't as advertised could not watch  flash as u can on a pc or lap top was . Advised was not enough words needed 4 more words so poor poor poor poor
0439023513|5.0|Mockingjay by Suzanne Collins is a great ending to the trilogy of the Hunger Games.  I was immediately sucked in to the story when Katniss returned home from the second Hunger Games to find her home and her district fire-bombed by the Capital.  Just imagine you came home and stepped on the ashes of your house.  That's what happened to Katniss.  After surviving the Hunger Games twice, Katniss thought she was safe but she wasn't and neither were her family or her friends or the life she knew.<br /> The last book is about the revolution against the Capital and getting rid of the Hunger Games.  Katniss is the heroine who is feels like a pawn and is trapped between the rebels and the Capital.  It is a story about war, loss and survival.  I enjoyed this book because the story was captivating, violent and a story of deception.  There were many twists and unexpected turns like when Peeta tried to kill Katniss.  But that is just a little sneak peak of the entire, riveting story.
1579655327|4.0|I've loved Kinfolk ever since I found it by chance at my local bookstore.  The magazine is a journal filled with lifestyle, decorating, farming, gardening and food stories.<br /><br />The cookbook is more like an expansion on the magazine.  It isn't a straight cookbook, but more of a record of places and people the publishers have met and shared meals.<br /><br />The recipes are more along the lines of home cooking with a little bit of flash.  Don't expect anything too advanced.  As always the photography is lovely, the same as the magazine.
B00908DDZM|3.0|I picked up Macklemore after hearing all the singles and seeing him live.  This album shows he is very talented but not my taste the whole way through.  The singles plus a few others are great to listen to but there is a lot of filler in my opinion.  Might just not be my taste but most will enjoy a descent amount of the album.
B006GECE9Y|1.0|Ok if u r going to  use full time  I got this so I could download flash but found there was limitations as a tablet with android means flash didn't work with all types of web sites so delayed both after 6 hours
B00FEHXISA|3.0|Liked the movie, but enjoyed the previous two movies a little more.  Iron Man was made out to be way too weak in this movie.
B00577WFZE|5.0|So enjoy this. Even though it's recorded live, it's done with the BBC's usual quality. If you like great blues and guitarmanship, buy this.
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|This album was very solid from start to finish.  I got it for the singles with hopes that the album was as good/fun as the band in all their youtube videos.  It was surprisingly fun and I literally listened to the whole thing 3 or 4 times in a row.  The lyrics and some fun photos are in the artwork. You won't be disappointed if you like most of their stuff.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I give this book a five star rating because it is a well written book with an obvious moral to the story.  Ender is a great human being because he handles everything with the power of an adult even though he is nothing above a child.  Treat everyone with respect is what this book teaches you. Also, find your limits and don't go passed them too far.
B00847KFDS|5.0|Making new songs from oldies with different artists is a risk. This one is awsome!!!!!!<br />I can't stop listning. Everytime I play this one I'm happy. Ofcourse I own the<br />CCR hits, but in a 'new coat' , they sound perfect!!<br /><br />Heiko Wester.
B00A9X9VAI|5.0|Much better than expected. Sci-fi time travels movies are very intriguing to me, so I thought I'd give this a try not knowing exactly what to expect. What I got was well paced and well balanced story telling with just enough action to keep it moving along at a nice clip. Leaving me thinking that any of us can change the future.
B0090X4GJE|4.0|I bought this on the hope that Ellie's hype was at least partially deserved.  She does deliver a solid album, especially the singles.  Surprising to me, most of the songs are rather in the same category of sound - full of long-ish slow-ish ballads.  Not a bad thing, but after singles like &#34;Lights&#34; and &#34;I need your love&#34; I expected some more up-tempo numbers.  She is, as I said, very talented and shows a wide range of singing capabilities on this record.
B005DOJ68K|5.0|Not only does this bring back a flood of memories, it is quite frankly one of the only albums with real singing. You can feel it, and it is clear they all felt it as they put it together. You can't help feeling this is very very real when you hear it. It jumps out from everything around it,
B000JIHP88|5.0|I bought this for my grandson.  He was very entertained.  The characters are colorful and the music is soothing.  I definitely would buy again.
B001CB8NQE|5.0|I loved this season because it had my all time favorite episode - &#34;The Shrine&#34; in it. David Hewlett was AWESOME in this episode like he always is in every episode but this one made me really cry. I felt really bad for him and everyone else there. It was hard watching him lose his memories. The scene that got me the most was when he was talking about his mother and not recognizing her. That and the scene where he was saying goodbye to everyone. He is just a fantastic actor. I just love him!!!!!! I would recommend this season because it has a lot of really great episodes on it. I am however sad that they cancelled the show. It still had so much to offer and the people behind the show doesn't realize how upset all the fans are for them cancelling the show. WE WANT IT BACK NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00BRUPICM|5.0|Starts out with a kidnapping of a young women who appears to be quite normal.  However as you read on, there are so many twists and turns you don't know what to believe.  But by the middle of the book, it all makes sense.  There are moments regarding where the kidnapped person is kept that will be to harsh for a lot of readers.  For once the ending is quite satisfying and logical.  A great crime thriller.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Update kept driving me crazy...I deleted facebook by accident n I then figured out that it updated when I downloaded it again...solved my problem!!! This has worked for me twice
0425252868|5.0|Easy reading book. A lot of information. Very exciting book and more availible stories than a lot of other books I've read. Thank You.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I read this for a book club and in preparation for the author's visit to our community.  While I usually don't like books with so many characters, and I did lose track of two or three of them (who's who?), Hosseini did a masterful job of weaving their stories together.  While I might have wanted more about certain characters, or a slightly different ending, that's just because I was captivated by the characters and wanted &#34;happily ever after.&#34;  This is more realistic and a warm story of the interrelatedness of families in and from war-torn Afghanistan. He calls it a 'love story&#34;, but not in the romantic sense, and that love comes through.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|We cleared up space and tried to download several times. Says it is compatible but it will not download. bummer.
B002AS463W|3.0|Story was as expected, but the picture quality was not ok through most of the movie, and the sound quality was poor.
B0026OR1UK|4.0|This was a pleasure to read and had great examples in it. At first, I was very skeptical until the author acknowledged that his terms were comparable and sometimes synonymous with the terms used in research on experts. The stories are very entertaining and provide excellent examples of practice and master teaching. I am still not completely sold on the idea that myelin is as important as the book emphasized and there are some other concepts that were not mentioned that are related to the influence of biology but overall this was a good read.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|So glad that I found these cards I have been looking for them forever! Need them for my camera and they apparently aren't making them anymore!
B000002J6H|5.0|There is nothing NOT to like about this music!! He is amazing as always, takes me back to great times.You will love it!!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|An American classic.  I had not read in many years and really enjoyed it!! The book is somewhat different from the movie.  This actually added to my enjoyment.  One of these (about the china dolls) explains where that part of the new &#34;Oz&#34; movie came from.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game has some of the best table game graphics ever, it plays smoothly, and is great all around. The only downside is that it requires more and more money later on and is unbalanced when you are \\"making\\" your gun.
B004Q3RDVG|5.0|Couldn't put the book down! Far more interesting than the movie versions.  Did buy the movie version of 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo', didn't like the movie versions of the other two.
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|I watched this movie using my Amazon Prime account. The movie quality was excellent in HD. The movie overall was pretty decent :-)
B003QS9TKU|5.0|We watched this with our daughters 10 and 12.  They loved it too.  Great story takes place during WWII.  Landing on an enchanted island that is ruled by a lion and getting what they need to save the day.  A bit of history and a lot of fun.  Better than most of the new films coming out for kids.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|James Dasher is brilliant! As a young adult reader, this book was a perfect follow-up series to when I read Divergent and The Hunger Games.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I struggled with a diagnosis of Colitis, uncontrollable weight gain and a series of health problems for 10 years. I had eliminated alot of processed and fast foods from my diet, going whole foods. I still had problems. One godsend, believe it or not, was discovering I was Gluten Intolerent a couple of years ago. It made me hone in on foods that were anti inflammatory. I basically felt I was eating nothing and should be losing weight and feeling better. Unfortunately I was not. A few weeks ago, I discovered the 5:2 and started immediately! I have learned a lot about my body and finally feel I am on the right path for the rest of my life! Even though I was eating organic, whole foods...I was not giving my digestion time to process and recover!!!  I dont have to eat little meals all day long! I was overeating still! The fasting has been another godsend! My belly has finally felt less bloated, lighter, cooler and most of all...flatter!! My eliminations are more regular and most of all, I am losing weight! Thank you for writing this book!
B003M6OW4Y|5.0|I chose this rating because I loved it - it was so different! I would highly recommend this series to anyone who is interested in sci-fi or futuristic shows....lots of drama! And the choreography of many of the scenes was spectacular! Believable! And the ending was good! Did not make me mad that there wasn't another season.....Well done!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|A book that keep you interested and you dont want to put down til the end? Worth getting to read
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A perfect sequel to The Shining, satisfying, scary and a with a great sense of closure. Bravo, Stephen,and thank you.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|Exactly what I expected, and I love that. When I turned it on in front of my date, first softly and then slowly increasing the volume each time I tried to subtly fondle her shoulder after flail-looping my arm behind her, I could tell, by her slightly distressed eyes and grimace, she knew exactly what this song was about. I could tell she wanted it - to stop, possible - and that I was the lucky woman to give it to her, and, perhaps, to get it from her, luckily, by having sex with her. I called her back for the second date and she picked up the phone after seeing me on Caller ID - score for Daft Punk!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have read all of Stephen King and I have a bad habit of gobbling up the book. I slowed it down and enjoyed it from front to back. Great story. Great dialogue.
0307744434|4.0|When I first started reading \\"The Night Circus\\", I didn't like.  As I read on, though, the story became more and more intriguing, and I found it difficult to put down.  In the end, I'd say that it is a fantasy love-story (though not sikeningly so!), told in several chronological \\"threads\\", which do tie nicely together.  Recommend that you go on and read it.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|Love this doll. This doll is cute and snuggly. She has the sweetest face and smells so good.This should be every child's first baby
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like it its entertaining. the fact that the game doesn't have an energy bar so you dont have to wait for your energy to fill up again is a plus.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Just like all the rest this book is an amazing story that has a twist at the end that you would never suspect
B002KJX4IE|5.0|this is a great fun family friendly ghost flick. I loved sharing a childhood favorite of mine with my daughter.
068484267X|5.0|A story of survival in the poorest of conditions in Ireland as experienced by this young boy. Rips your heart out.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Great app, very addictive.  Will keep u busy for hours!  Great family fun. Would definitely recommend this app to others
B001I975AU|5.0|Definitely in fairytale land.  It's cute and whimsical about an 18-year old wanting her independence.  This mature young lady, Samantha, is the daughter of the President of the United States.  Independence from that type of family is impossible.  Being alone and making mistakes is part of the growing up experience and that is what Samantha tries to achieve to separate herself from the shadow of her parents' political life where everyone lives in a fishbowl.  This is a fun film with its heartaches and Samantha comes out into her own.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|This CD rocks! Gotye is creative and talented, something the music industry is missing these days. I'm so glad he has hit the scene. Hope he stays around for years to come.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|my granddaughter loves this songs and plays it all the time. It has a nice beat and she has learned the words to it already.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's  a very time consuming game but it's worth it because it's fun. I think anyone who likes animals would be very interested in this game. :-)
1848507836|1.0|If you are looking for a heart warming-spirit lifting book - keep searching. She spends 95% of the book telling you about her past upbringing and 5% about what happened up there. I learned more about other religions than about the &#34;Oneness&#34; in her book. She never mentions God - nor angels or anything really positive except for a 3-4 sentences about her dad... She pretty much states SHE gave herself cancer by being afraid of it and SHE healed herself by letting go of her fear...WTH??? Really? Pretty boring read, skimmed through most of it. If you want a good uplifting book that will make you think and your heart swell - read Embraced by the Light by Betty J. Eadie.... Now THAT is a good book!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|it will not load good but I love the game thank you very much this is the best game ever
B003I55BIA|5.0|This book was so good, read it in one day. The story line was so good ...didn't want it to end
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This author amazed and had me spellbound. The twists and turns kept me enthralled and her sardonic sentences at the end of each chapter wryly amused me. I am thirsty to read her again...fantastic!
B0090KZDSK|4.0|Love the story, but you know, A Trilogy, 3 books, and how long do I have to wait for the final book to come out.  NOT HAPPY
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I like th story, but it REALLY bothers me that so much Christian mythology was used without there being a God.  Also, Clary is kind of a jerk to Simon.
B008UZCZL4|5.0|Truly an ultimate collection for all matrix fans. From the movies to behind the scene videos.<br />Feature-packed collections. Follow the white rabbit!
B0097C8XL0|5.0|This is a really great app! My niece loves it so she plays it all the time. This app passes the time and is really fun! I regimens this to kids all ages.
080419257X|5.0|I really enjoyed this (book on tape). The author's view of the periods both before and after Jesus' death was revealing to me. He also did a great job of separating historical information and biblical folklore.<br /><br />Great read (or listen).
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I loved the watch! It is an excellent time piece. Great for a gift or for yourself. It is truly a nice watch!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this a really fun game that everyone should play great for all ages and is great for passing time I recommend this for everyone!
B00EJ9RIXA|2.0|I had hoped this would work just like my phone app does.  But it doesn't.  It is just another viewer.  I have that in as a regular feature on any of my kindles.
B00DW36G32|5.0|It was a good movie. Kind of slow at times.but all in all a pretty good movie.i give it a  good rating.
0393338398|5.0|A great book. So much better than the movie, but to be fair, there is no way the movie would have been able to cover half of what the book talks about. The book is great, I loved it and the last chapter really makes me think about how the business of the sport is executed.
1781162646|5.0|I love Stephen King's books, I've read them all. Don't know how he can come up with the stories but they are always great and keep you on the edge of your seat.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I had almost no storage, and with a touch of a button I had 3/4 of it cleaned! It works terrifically and I highly recommend it if you happened to be running out of room.
B0070DQZ86|5.0|It was fantastic, the actors were so good. Morgan Fairchild, out of this world, Kevin K, made me wish I was his lover, Nottingham deserved a special award, and his mom was the bomb-great. Exciting, full of love.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Very good, perhaps excellent, English period piece.  I want it to continue on-will it?  Mary will have a baby, I hope, and Downton Abbey will go on forever.
1878424777|5.0|simple but so true.  i found this book to be a good read and one you should read more then once.
B00459EZLW|5.0|This is a very underrated show. It was very different from from previous Stargate series, but in my opinion equal to SG-1 and Atlantis.
145210655X|5.0|I am a huge Star Wars fan and I know my son will love this book.  Very creative and a lot of fun to read
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Used it for the bathroom scale. Works great. Very, very cheap price. Time will tell how long it lasts. Quick S&H.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Going in I thought it wasn't something of my taste, but it's awesome on many levels! I highly suggest you watch this, you'll get hooked!
0785153942|5.0|Excellent back story with really great art, with a strong focus on the characters involved. I wish it had been longer, though.  It only took me 30-40 minutes to finish reading it. The Pacific Rim world has so much more potential for story telling, such that it seems like this graphic novel and the movie are just snapshots from that universe.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|this was a action packed suspenseful movie. I enjoyed it very much. Will suggest this to my friends & family.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is very fun but it is difficult to earn money. I think the games should be less money that would be cool. I this game is challenging which is very good for your brain
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I say that because it is very discourging. It is well written and story line is clear but I did not like the story as a whole. Having said that, I would recommend the book.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|The story line was tense though clearly well staged. Will like to see sequel. And will send this approval to my friends.
B0059DQHHI|4.0|I watched the movie with interest from beginning to end because it was fifficult to know wgere the direc t or was taking us until 2/3 of yhe way. The movie is enjoyable though with a sad and unexpected ending.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|It does the job! Using it to keep my Christmas list in order. So far so good. It is colorfull too!
B00D6BU8GG|5.0|Loved the action packed, eventful movie. I always love Bruce Willis as an actor. Will definitely suggest to my friends.
B00B6DTIGW|4.0|I don't want to say too much, but if you like to be frightened, this movie is for you.  The acting is good and the concept interesting...
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Be prepared to love and loose but to enjoy the journey. Its true testament that people do change your lives for the better.
B001TCHDPS|3.0|Just OK.  I liked the Cold Fact album a lot better.  Some of the songs are good enough to listen to over and over.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Skyfall is one of the best Bond movies.  Good story, great locations, beautiful women and (of course) plenty of action that can more than hold its own in this age of heavy duty action flicks.  Get it, you won't regret it...
B009LDCZDC|1.0|I love Amazon and have had no difficulty ordering a range of products over the years - all with high satisfaction;  however when I ordered the Second Season of Homeland, I was dismayed to receive a nonfunctioning disk.  The product was tried on the regular dvd, the blue ray dvd as well as my computer - all without success and just jibberish on the screen.  How disappointing!  However Amazon refunded our purchase in full on a very prompt basis!  As such I would not hesitate this type of product from Amazon in the future.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|If you saw the movie Looking for Sugarman, you have to get this album.  It's one of a kind.  Very good.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have had subway surfers on my kindle for a while now and it's one of those addictive little games that keeps you coming back for more. I would probably compare it to sonic when you couldn't save it so you stayed playing it. I have introduced several friends to it and they all log  it too.
B00499QUK2|5.0|love, Love LOVE this show! Clever, funny and tons of fun. The only downside are the 3 episodes per series. It is easy to addicted to this show!
B0074V3712|4.0|E.O. Wilson explains social insect development as group evolution, instead of 'the selfish gene' approach given by Dawkins and others. His view is that social evolution, in the form of evolution of small groups of hominids, was at odds with individual selection in humans, and that the tension between these two evolutionary forces explains modern human nature.<br /><br />Even if you disagree with some of his conclusions, you will be amazed by the astonishing array of evidence he brings in support of his thesis. You can buy it for the pictures alone.<br /><br />I was somewhat unhappy with the quality of the illustrations in the Kindle version, however, and would recommend buying the book instead.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Really love the show! Here is actually something you can watch that is not full of blood guts and violence!
B001NLKZZ0|5.0|The Inner Game of Golf and Zen Golf should be part of every golfer's library.  These outstanding books will help you escape paralysis by analyses and show you in spades why our mind and body will accomplish wonderful, sometimes unexpected, things when just get out,of the way.<br />Well worth reading again and again.
B000FC10MU|4.0|This book takes you on a journey through the world of gods, both modern and ancient, who inhabit America. It skillfully weaves an engaging narrative into a snapshot of this world, and uses facts from real mythology to enhance and deepen the developed panorama.
B001P06GX4|4.0|i like this game because it helps my kids 5 and 7 years old to concentrate and use strategies. they have fun with friends and its a great family game..
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I have finished first serial. It reminds me to x files. I like it very much and will keep watching.
B0081BU42O|4.0|The last entry in the series of 'culture' novels from Iain M. Banks. More of the same, if you liked Excession, Use of Weapons, Consider Phlebas, Matter, and the others, you'll like this one.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This may or may not be a fantasy. I choose to believe this young man's story. The cinematography was beyond compare. Lovely to watch. I have seen this many times and that may mean it will be a classic - perhaps just for children, but then it is really for adults to open their eyes, to believe in whatever they choose.
B00846REIS|5.0|Wow what can you say.  Awesome trilogy.  First trilogy I have read and must say it did not disappoint. Great storylines.
B008602KQI|4.0|There was lots of action and a modern twist to gladiator games.  You certainly couldn't fall asleep on this movie.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|I like this movie because it is based on a true story.  It has a great story line and even if you aren't a baseball fan, you'll probably enjoy this.
B00FEN000S|5.0|Oh my friggin goodness! Everything about Pacific Rim is just mind blowingly epic. Without spoilers, I have to say that skyscraper sized mechs versus skyscraper sized monsters taller than the Empire State Building? What's not to like?
B003TOMAPC|5.0|I loved the combination of the grit and feel (akin to Watchmen or Dark Knight) and the fun of a kid just going all out and dealing with growing up.  Overall just a fun movie if you don't mind gore.
B004QXJZXA|5.0|This is a movie that I will watch over and over. Some of the footage is just too good to miss if you are a fan of Le Mans
B00BY7NK96|4.0|A solid book. Plenty to think about. Good solid advice, with issues sensitively covered in a no-nonsense approach.  Get out there and lean in - do bow out before you try. I liked it.
B003UYV08E|5.0|Not quite as good as the first, but can't help but love Robert Downey Jr in this role.  He was made to play it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game! It's progressive....it keeps you interested with new challenges in each room! I can't wait for the other levels!
B005MLOKXA|3.0|I enjoy courtroom drama, and some of the courtroom scenes are well done and very original.  The main characters are well-developed and the acting is good, but I find it hard to identify with anyone.  My husband and I both groan when Alicia and Will try to come to terms with their relationship. That's one scenario that is B-O-R-I-N-G.  Some of the plot lines leave me puzzled, altho my husband seems to follow them. I have fallen asleep more than once in the middle of this series.
B00FVS3RZQ|5.0|YAY!!! LOVE THIS SHOW!!!! I so bought season 4 to save 12% per episode!!! Sweet deal can't wait to get home Oh and cross bows on amazon like Darrell's are like 365 prime, hahaha!
B005544V6A|5.0|Smart entertainment, good looking men & women. High enegery and great fashion.  I love it.  I can't wait to watch more.
1616550414|4.0|It came fast and like the book but did wish that it was a little bit cheaper and the shipping was a bit much
0307476073|5.0|I chose this book for my vacation read after  a great recommendation from a friend.  Inspirational, emotional, enjoyable!  Couldn't put it down.
6304711905|5.0|This movie is as close to reality as any of the movies made about the OK Corral story.  Most of the other movies aren't even close.  It still has a lot errors that I won't bother to write down (like Johnny Ringo), but for the most part the errors are small time.  &#34;Tombstone&#34; is a great western and the acting is excellent.
B001TH16DI|5.0|This boxed set contains all six of the original Star Trek movies re-mastered in HD. The movies themselves range from lukewarm to brilliant. It is a good gift for any Star Trek fan. I bought this for my father on Father's Day, but I get more use out of it because I actually remember that we have the set.<br />My only complaint is that the fourth movie was not that good. Unless Free Willy was your favorite movie of all time, you will be just fine if you skip the fourth movie.
B005721Y7Y|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites. I wish it was released to watch anytime for free.<br />As old as it is, I don't think I need tto pay everytime I want to watch it.
B00AEFZ2DG|5.0|I bought this because I liked the movie.  DVD was in excellent condition.  That is all I need to say.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was a fantastic story I cried thru out the whole book and the end I cried like a baby. Everyone should read this book
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Familiar territory ( a return to the Overlook) and somewhat familiar territory (Teenytown/Joyland) cool new characters and an answer to the long posed question &#34;what's up Doc?&#34;.  Sorry it came to an end, as usual.  Another great ride thanks to Stephen King.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|Loved &#34;Married With Children&#34;, funny from first episode to the last  The only problem I had with it is the 6 thousand minutes of viewing.  Still suffering burnout.  Will watch it again later.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Hcgvjbjhij<br />Vjvjvjvjvjvjvugigihihobkb giving backbench chick h ugh b I've big in. J<br />Crucifix by chubby v h chic chic church chic
B00C81AVNU|4.0|Kinky Boots<br />good music. enjoyed the cd.  cd worth the price.  makes you enjoy the show all over again.would recommend it. lively.
B001UV4XIS|3.0|Bought it because I have all the other Harry Potters and this finished the collection.  Don't know why I started collecting them.  Not really into the genre.
B002RI9ORI|4.0|Written in an entertaining yet informative, well thought through style. Enough in here to entertain, fascinate, educate and frighten the pants off you. Will read Bad Pharma for sure
B00004Y6NW|5.0|Yeah, I'll admit right from the start: I am crazy and completely biased when it comes to Dire Straits & Knopfler. He and I are about the same age. It all started when I first heard that guitar playing in Sultans, so long ago. There was simply nothing like it I had ever heard. The tone, the amazing dexterity, the facility, the versatility, the maturity, the phrasing, the sophistication, the sheer technical wizardry....and this was a NEW band? Surely this was one of the greatest and most technically amazing guitarists I'd ever heard. I bought it on vinyl immediately. The truly, truly incredible thing, besides the guitar pyrotechnics, was the maturity and poetry of the songs, from such a young man. This was wonderfully detailed, mature songwriting and storytelling, so sensitive, so beautifully crafted, and so far beyond anything out there at the time, worthy of Lennon & McCartney at their very best.<br /><br />If you want to rock out, he will do it. If you want it slow, he's got it covered. Loud, bluesy, classical, jazzy, restrained, folk, he runs the gamut. Such versatility and ability is without parallel in any form of music today, possibly ever.<br /><br />Down to the Waterline, At the Gallery, Six Blade Knife, Southbound Again, etc.,....fantastic songs which all have stood the test of time. And you can say that about every song on this epic album. Mark is a truly great songwriter and surely one of the greatest guitarists who ever lived. It started all those years ago, and we are still able to see and hear this amazing musician, who is still creating magnificent music.
B0045HCJQW|5.0|One of the best films of the thirties.  At least I think so.  If you're into old B&W comedy classics you must have this one.  I favor Jean Arthur more than Hepburn, but this is a great movie.
1416594795|5.0|Its a very good book that I didn't want to stop reading once I started, Richard Dawkins really explains evolution well and in a way that really grabs the interest of the reader
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I have loved reading this series, but, lately, they all seem to,be the same.  I am disappointed and want the old action back.
B005LAIIMG|4.0|We saw World War Z in the theaters (3D) and it was a really great movie experience.  This movie is pure action and suspense...never boring, never dull.  The term \\"fast paced\\" is an understatement when applied to this movie!<br /><br />However...perhaps therein lies the problem.  Could it be that this movie is a little TOO fast paced?  I think it might have been better if the movie had slowed down a bit in parts, so we could get to know the people a little better - know what they are feeling.<br /><br />In the movie, Brad Pitt plays a retired United Nations employee named Gerry Lane who is pulled back into service to travel the world in a race against time  (okay, a little clich&eacute;, but whatever...)  He must stop a zombie pandemic that is threatening to wipe humanity off the planet! In this pandemic, a person will turn into a ferocious man-eating zombie just 12 seconds after being bitten.<br /><br />Ahh yes.  More zombies!  More apocalypse!<br /><br />Brad Pitt does a fine job in this movie...but then, he always does.  It wasn't his fault that the writers did not include much character development.  In the movie, his character has a wife and two little girls - all wonderfully acted...however, I longed for more....I wanted to get to know these people better.<br /><br />Yes, the movie was fast paced.  The zombies in this flick are literally MANIC, frenzied masses.  These are not the slow lumbering zombies of past movies.  People could get away from those zombies!  Some might say that these \\"modern\\" zombies (reminiscent of the crazed creatures in I Am Legend)are scarier than those slow moving zombies of old.  I might politely disagree.  The old style zombies created more suspense.  Will the person get away or not?  The viewer didn't know.  Plus, the old style zombies seemed more disturbingly....human, as opposed to simply CG creations.<br /><br />However....that being said, the movie is still very watchable.  There is not a lot of blood and gore (like on The Walking Dead) so don't expect that.  This is a more \\"high-tech\\" zombie flick.  It's good - the acting is good - and the plot is suspenseful.  The first time you watch, you will probably be on the edge of your seat the whole time.<br /><br />So even though I had a few complaints about the movie, overall I would recommend watching it.  World War Z delivers great movie entertainment. I won't spoil the ending for you, since the element of suspense is what the film is based on. We even bought the movie after seeing it in the theater.) so don't expect that.  This is a more \\"high-tech\\" zombie flick.  It's good - the acting is good - and the plot is suspenseful.

B00CY0JY88|5.0|I Love this series, I have fallen in love with the charaters and just want the series to fullfil its self. I can''t wait!!
0689835604|5.0|Fun! Educational! Visual! Stimulating. Well put together! All around good buy! Great book for all ages. A classic must for any parent's baby book collection!

B000JIHP88|3.0|Not very easy to put together... There are many other mobiles out there that are better, require less assembly, are more visually stimulating... Stick with the baby Einstein mobile...
B00E7SFAAG|4.0|This is a pretty cute game and my 6 year old gets a kick out of it when he plays.
1476727651|5.0|I loved Stephen King's book, \\"The Shining\\" and I also loved the movie version of the book. Of course I am a big fan of Stephen King and also a big fan of Jack Nicholson, who did a great job of playing John Torrance.  I still remember what was written on the mirror and Danny Torrance saying over and over \\"REDRUM\\", which was murder spelled backwards.<br />I'm glad Stephen came up with this sequel of what happened to Wendy & Daniel Torrance after that horrible explosion at the Overlook hotel. That being said, I don't think any sequel could top \\"The Shining\\". Of the four people who were present the day the Overlook burned to the ground, only three survived. I thought, however, the Overlook's chef, \\"Doc\\" Richard Hallorann, had died in the explosion. I'm pleased to learn he survived, especially since he and Danny shared such an incredible bond. Both of them possessed powerful hunches and intuitions. Danny has this special gift but I learned from this novel that so does a little girl named Abra Stone.<br />Danny remembered his friend, Dick Halloran, telling him once upon a time, \\"If you see something bad, close your eyes and tell yourself it's not there and when you open them again, it will be gone.\\"<br />Readers, of all the dead things in Overlook, can you remember who might have been the worst?  Something from that destroyed resort hotel might be coming back to haunt us. Who knows? But, keep an eye out, my friends, for leeches who travel around in their recreational vehicles looking for children who have psychic abilities.<br />Who else but the master of imagination could recover from a car accident that almost killed him. In June, 1999 a motorist ran over Stephen while he was walking down a dirt road. I, for one, am glad Stephen recovered and kept on writing more stories. I have no doubt the master of horror fiction knows about shattered vertebra and broken ribs that never cease crying out.<br />Albeit- I didn't think \\"Doctor Sleep\\" was gruesome or evil, but rather a story that surprised and fascinated. I found it to be very interesting and a good read. Plus, I am really glad Stephen wrote a sequel to his exceptional novel, \\"The Shining\\".<br /><br />Jeannie Walker - Award Winning Author - \\"Fighting the Devil\\" - A True Story of Consuming Passion, Deadly Poison, and Murderory that surprised and fascinated.

B005WUHAX8|1.0|I loved my Lifeproof case right up until the moment I was told by the Apple repair genius that it caused damage to my phone.  The on/off switch at the top of my Iphone 4S just stopped working one night.  When I took it in to the local Apple store they told me that there was research done on these phones and that there were a few instances of them causing damage to the phones due to the constant pressure the case puts on the edge of the phones and because you have to use more force to turn the phone on or off.  This will damage the spring.<br /><br />Out of warranty so no help with the phone and Lifeproof of course said they'd never heard of the issue and offered to replace my case !!!  The case isn't broken the phone is.<br /><br />There is no warrant for damage the case may cause to the phone.
B00CJ32S74|5.0|soundtrack just as good as the movie. Writing these reviews is too much work. but really, how many words do i have to write?
B0042RJWTC|5.0|I recently finished watching the whole series of &#34;The Tudors&#34; and it has been delightful. I was living all the feelings that are very nicely presented in the episodes and the main characters are very nicely contoured.<br /><br />Even if it has some 18+ scenes, overall, the entire series has blown me away from the first episode. The action, the relationships, the costumes, everything just screams a great movie. Nevertheless, the last episode took my mind to &#34;A Christmas Carol&#34; because of the ghosts, but it is very nicely constructed.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this show for all the people that love history, but a greatly produced film too.
B0027MJU00|4.0|She's a great writer. I've read all 3 of her books and they're all page turners. I was a little disappointed with the ending, as I was with gone girl, but over all it's a good, entertaining read.
B008K8X0IS|5.0|This collection is a must have for any Game of Throne Fan! Tons of bonus content and features on these disks will have you immersed in the World of Westeros long after you've completed Season 1. Packaging is nice, and the Dragon Egg  Collectible is a wonderful addition to my collection. It doesn't seem that editions such as these have been made for the following season, at least not yet anyways, but one can only hope!<br /><br />Product arrived on time and in proper shape using Amazon Prime.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|My son loves this game.  He would spend hours on it if I let him. Good game to get :-)
1401917232|5.0|I pre-ordered Gary's latest book, Love Has Forgotten No One, because his previous two works were life changers for me.  These books have enabled me to understand A Course in Miracles, and I am currently in my 8th reading of it and still finding material that I never understood before.  As Arten and Pursah point out, we must have constant repetition of these ideas in order for them to penetrate the many layers of our subconscious and undo the ego.  This book also contains practical information that will help us enjoy a healthy journey through physical life, while we are doing our forgiveness lessons.  As in the last two books, there is the uncompromising reminder that we are not here in the illusion, and that our final goal is to achieve enlightenment and go home to God.
B000J4QWM2|4.0|When I switched to Blurays, what's available for Miami Vice is the director's unrated version. Though not much difference from the original one, I prefer what I saw on the big screen.<br /><br />Thus, when I found the DVD original theatrical version, I bought it. This is a hard find.
0312370849|1.0|Paris, 1942. The infamous roundup of thousands of Jewish families in the Vélodrome d'Hiver, an indoor bike racing track, through the eyes of a 10-year old girl. The same event investigated 60 years later by a Paris-based middle-aged American journalist. Sounds interesting? Well, don't let yourself be fooled. The theme had a great potential, but it was reduced to nothing but a whiny soap opera on nearly 300 pages.<br /><br />Technically, this book doesn't reach up to par with mediocre chit-lit. In its first half, the girl's point of view alternates with that of Julia, the American. Such approach, when done professionally, adds value to a book. In this case it was plainly disturbing. In addition, it takes an accomplished author to reproduce the voice of a child authentically, which is not the case here. It was still better though than the second half, which is narrated by Julia only and getting worse by the page.  The original story is nearly abandoned, only to be replaced with Julia's marital problems and her marriage-long effort to win respect of her French husband's posh family.<br /><br />The author's intentions are poorly disguised. She is desperately trying to create drama and mystery where there is none, concealing certain things from the reader as efficiently as a 3-year old hidden under a glassed coffee table.  Her intent to sound serious and/or arouse compassion usually sounds just pathetic. Characterization is description-based, not supported by actions.  Emotions are conveyed by statements and often exaggerated, especially on the part of Julia. There is a painstaking effort visible behind actions pieced together to drive the plot forward. All of the above combines into a reading experience comparable to watching a Mexican telenovela.<br /><br />I'm positive that the author meant to pay respect to Holocaust victims, but her writing skills just don't match the complexity of the topic.
B00354Y9ZU|5.0|Over the summer I was introduced to mr. Godin's book 'The Icarus Deception' and I have been reading/listening to him ever since. I WILL NEVER BE THE SAME. Seth Godin has changed how I will forever see the world. Thank you for your &#34;gifts.&#34;

B00CU9LHY2|5.0|Good stuff, A lot of music that I hadn't heard different outtakes. The live stuff is really good also. Definitely worth buying.
B00F6NKFQK|5.0|Quirky, fresh and funny. This book charmed me from the first page. A reimagined Greek myth? I'm in. I loved Medvedkov's use of language as much as his imagination. True to his promise, the author delivers short funnies you can read on a quick break from the boss or the kids. This is flash fiction done well. From Perseus at a press conference to space squirrels to time travel, Let's Conquer Paris has a little of everything and it will all make you chuckle and scratch your head. Don't be dull in the brainbone (as Medvedkov's Trojan warriors would say) buy this book before the author figures out it's worth much more than the 99 pennies he's selling it for. Well written, well edited and well done!
B00DSTBMMU|3.0|Just a couple of songs of note.  Not worth buying the whole CD.  If selling a CD all the songs need to be worthy.

B005WUHAX8|2.0|It took me a while to purchase this case because I really didn't want to spend more on my case than I spent on my phone, but I figured since it was waterproof it was worth it.  Right away, there were a bunch of problems. It's difficult to hear when you're on the phone so most often I used my headphones. Which brings me to another problem...you have to switch to the headphone adapter and take out the jack plug (which is nearly impossible to keep up with because of it's size, there was an extra one attached to the adapter, but it popped off and got lost who knows where).  The charging port is too small and most of my chargers and even my fm transmitter won't fit.  It it also too deep and I can't use any kind of dock so most of my previously purchased accessories are no longer useful.  It did actually protect my phone from water the couple of time I used it around water, but today's discovery makes me a little nervous and more than a little angry...after just 6 months, my headphone adapter no longer works.  I went to get a replacement but the warranty is just 90 days unless you register it (which I forgot to).  While looking around on their site, I discovered that my phone will not be replaced if it becomes damaged by water because I did not spend even more money on their water protection plan! (I never knew there was one...and the advertise it like it is included).  These people are liars and con artists and their product is really not worth the price you pay for it.
B009LDCZDC|5.0|Well written (except a Marine would never turn away from his country). Keeps you on edge at all times. If you haven't see the series it is worth buying back seasons to start from the beginning.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|As a working mom, I found this book to be very encouraging.  I struggle every day to  be the best mom I can, and still give my job 100% of my effort.  Sheryl Strandberg's advice taught me to put the job in perspective, value my professional worth, and making time to be with my family is perfectly fine.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Loved this movie!<br />Funny and yet tender to see how children can soften a grown man.<br />I suggest you go see it!
B008WOULPK|5.0|Grace Coddington's memoir is candid and filled with intriguing glimpses into a fascinating person who mostly managed to be in exactly the right place at the right time. The tragedies she encountered were shocking and the fact that she continued on, is a testament to human will and never giving up the pursuit of dreams and destiny. I so wish I could meet this amazing woman some day! Thank you Grace for being 'Grace' and facilitating so much art and beauty over the last several decades.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This was a very refreshing story, but started a little slow for me.  Once into the story it seemed to pick up, I would say just stick with it.

B00DJZR46G|4.0|For the last dozen years, Elton John's albums have been approached and marketed in pretty much the same way: He's eschewing the pop charts in favor of &#34;getting back to his roots&#34; and making good albums again. His albums are hailed as a return to form, harkening back to such classics as Tumbleweed Connection or, in this case, to his self-titled album from 1970. There's some truth in this, but I find it a bit inaccurate. (The narrative was modified a bit for his collaboration with Leon Russell, but it was still a matter of digging into the past to create something in the present.) Yes, Elton simplified his sound for The Diving Board. No, it is not the Elton John of 1970.<br /><br />I don't think it's fair to compare the Elton John of today to the Elton John of the 1970s. I have a strong preference for the early Elton John (if he'd done nothing but Goodbye, Yellow Brick Road, he'd still be one of my all-time favorites). He's become a great elder statesman, shedding the mishaps of the mid-80s through the 90s and producing a great run of albums. And that's what The Diving Board calls to mind to me: Rather than feeling like his albums from 40 years ago, it feels like a companion piece to 2001's outstanding Songs from the West Coast.<br /><br />That album had some modern flourishes, but overall it was the album where Elton and Taupin figured out how to make music at this stage in their careers. Before the vocal surgery he had in the 80s, Elton's voice was different. He had amazing range and loved to show it off, often going way up for those high notes. So, in his &#34;classic period,&#34; he wrote songs differently. In his middle period, he chased some trends, cranked out some good singles, but didn't make any truly great albums after Too Low for Zero. It's only been since Songs from the West Coast that Elton really got back on track.<br /><br />What they began with &#34;This Train Don't Stop There Anymore&#34; is felt once again, just as deeply, in the incredible &#34;Home Again&#34; on The Diving Board. Other songs put his piano playing above all else, even including some short instrumental interludes, making a strong case for Elton to pursue more instrumentals in the future. I'm not too big on the gospel-sounding songs, but they're appropriate and likeable enough. My favorites are mainly in the first half of the album, like &#34;Oscar Wilde Gets Out&#34; and &#34;The Ballad of Blind Tom.&#34; But it's &#34;Home Again&#34; that takes this album to the next level. It's the centerpiece, the latterday masterpiece, that makes this more than just some product from a veteran artist.<br /><br />If you haven't liked Elton over the past decade or so, I don't know that The Diving Board will be enough to bring you back. But if you liked SFTWC, Peachtree Road (not my favorite, but has a few good songs), The Captain and the Kid, and The Union, I think you'll welcome this one as another solid entry in one of the great catalog's in rock history.&#34;Home Again&#34; on The Diving Board.
