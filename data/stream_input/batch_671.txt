0743496728|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I was hooked starting at the very first paragraph. This is a very powerful book that really makes you think. Nothing is ever black or white. There are always shades of gray and Jodi Picoult does an excellent job of exposing those shades. She draws you into her characters to the point where you feel you really know them. Any one who knows a child should read this book. It's a must read!!!
0307165485|5.0|I had this book in the early 80's when I was a child, and to this day it is my favorite.  As a kid I asked my mom to read it to my sister and I everyday.  Mistress Mouse was my favorite story.  I bought it as part of a baby shower gift and I hope that it will be loved by that baby as much as my sister and I loved it.  I ordered a new one for us both, even though my mom still has our original.
1576754227|4.0|This small book reads like a \\"best of\\" summary of personal development strategies. Brian Tracey captures a ton of excellent techniques and ideas and cuts through the fluff to present actual ideas that you can apply (how to set goals, 80/20 rule, prioritizing, identifying and focusing on your key career strengths, etc.). I thoroughly enjoyed it and will keep it as a reference to refer to again and again.
0307277887|4.0|It takes a special reader to appreciate a book like this. As I was reading DARKLY DREAMING DEXTER, I questioned, again, the fascination I have for serial killers. Certainly, I could never be one. I rescued a severely diseased alley cat and brought her into my home because I didn't have the stomach to give her to a \\"no-kill\\" shelter. (There's no such thing, btw, as a no-kill shelter for severely diseased strays.) One of the telltale signs of a sociopath is a complete and utter disregard for life. While I was finishing this book last night, I looked at my alley cat, who was lounging gratefully on my stomach, and tried to imagine harming her. Of course, I was unsuccessful.    Yet I count The Silence of the Lambs as one of my favorite films largely because of Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Hannibal Lecter, and my enjoyment of this book wasn't hampered by Dexter's Dark Passenger who cam out to play and did interesting things with a knife and people's body.    Make no mistake - Dexter Morgan is a monster. He tells us this repeatedly, in whimsical, witty prose, and yet we find ourselves - we, gentle readers all of us (I hope) - don't see ourselves in Dexter. For a book to be considered successful amongst readers and critics alike, its hero or heroine must be a character that everyone can relate to. Yet...    Dexter Morgan is a blood spatter analyst for the Miami police department, and he is also a serial killer. His foster father, Harry, recognized Dexter's emptiness when he was young and dedicated his life to putting Dexter on a path that would keep him alive. The love, or perhaps pity, that Harry must have felt for Dexter! How easy it would have been to turn him into an institution when he became aware of Dexter's disdain for life. Instead, the Code of Harry (Dexter's term) is developed, a set of rules that even an emotionless depraved anything-but-human Dexter must follow. That Dexter follows them tells us a bit more about \\"empty-hearted Dexter\\" than even he realizes. Monsters don't follow rules.    Dexter and his Dark Passenger (as he names the evil inside of him) live by the Harry's rules, and the most important one is to stick to bad guys. Don't kill just anyone to satiate your hunger, make sure that your victims deserve to die.    In this, the first in what will be a three-book series (and hopefully more!) in September, bloodless body parts are being found, and Dexter finds that he is drawn to them, more so than usual. He has a reputation in the police department - not a good one! - for being able to figure out the \\"serials\\", for who else would make sense to him if not a kinsman? But as the body toll increases, Dexter finds himself plagued, for the first time in his life, by dreams that are almost foretelling. And he starts to wonder if his startling accuracy at predicting what to look for and where is because perhaps, just perhaps, the killer is him. That the Dark Passenger went for a ride without him.    I said that it takes a special reader to appreciate a book like this - as well, it takes a superbly gifted writer to write such a book. Dexter appeals to us because he is witty and charming, and as readers, we find that while we certainly don't condone the desires of his Dark Passenger, he - as Entertainment Weekly put it so well - solicits our love. With positively prancing prose, and a lively first-person narrative style, we find ourselves pulled in to Dexter's little world. We follow him as he investigates himself, and get to know his Dark Passenger. Lindsay wisely keeps us at a distance when the Dark Passenger has taken over, and only hints at what Dexter is \\"playing\\" with. That was a wise decision. Had we been given a closer look at the Dark Passenger's desires, and how they were fulfilled (read: gore), Dexter wouldn't have nearly so dashing and dear.    My only criticism is that the ending was unsatisfying. It felt abrupt and contrived. Nevertheless, it made perfect sense. Still.    The next book in the series is [[ASIN:1400095921 Dearly Devoted Dexter]].  In September, [[ASIN:0385518331 Dexter in the Dark: A Novel]]is being released in hardcover.    Showtime made a 13-episode serial out of this, and the first season largely follows the plot. Indeed, the only reason I knew of the book was because of the dark and daring series that Showtime is airing. I believe that Season 1 is still available OnDemand; if not, Showtime is running reruns, and there will be a Season 2. Michael C. Hall, fresh from his spot-on portrayal of a gay funeral director, plays Dexter in the Showtime series. The characters that Lindsay brought so vividly to life are very well represented.
0142000671|3.0|Look, I know people love this book. \\"It brilliantly captures the working man's life during the great depression....vivid pictures of the surroundings...one of the best things you will ever read...\\" and so forth.  <br /> <br />I didn't hate this book. It does tell a good story, and the overall feeling fo the novel is one I enjoy. I like some of the characters, Crooks is a particular favorite. <br /> <br />I just don't find Steinbeck to be a very good writer. Obviously he can weave a good tale, and he sets the mood well, but his descriptions are bland and unnecessary. He does exactly what one is not supposed to do when writing: he tells, he does not shoe. I don't need to know that the tar bucket hanging from the wall has a wrinkled old rag dangling out of it. The amount of flies buzzing through the air has no bearing on anything, and serves only to fill the otherwise descriptionless pages.  <br /> <br />Each chapter follows the same style. There is that needless and boring description, followed by an introduction to a character. Usually these characters are doing something iconic or performing an act that defines them. Whether it be solitaire, reading or petting mice until they die, there is an overly symbolic paragraph about each character. <br /> <br />Then comes the dialogue. There is much of it, and it pretty much fills all those 108(?) pages. The novel is written more like a play, with each character taking turns to speak and then listening patiently and apparantly thoughtlessly. You never get to see inside these characters heads. They simply speak and sit around. There are only faint allusions to the actual work that they do.  <br /> <br />But hey, this book is a classic, and all the intelligent people love it. Maybe it is cool to praise it beyond its merits, because look, it says Steinbeck on the cover. I want to fit in. I want to be considered educated. Let me try to slurp Steinbeck a little:  <br /> <br />This book creates a breathtaking backdrop of loneliness and hopefulness. The painstakingly detailed bunkhouse serves as metaphor for the isolation that these poor working men faced. As the characters fight to survive in a world of hardship and hard labor, they learn that friends are more important then money, and that dreams make life worth living. One of the top 3 books I have ever read. <br /> <br />That was difficult. Now I am simply a mindless drone, a sheep following the crowd. At least I fit in with the intelligent people. Maybe I should go reread THE SUN ALSO RISES. Another timeless classic, right

B00026WUBE|3.0|Yeah, it's a big shame that, despite their long history of collaboration, the only official studio album that Bob Dylan ever recorded with The Band is Planet Waves.  Unfortunately, the best qualities of each entity didn't surface in this album.  Just as unfortunately, though there's some worthwhile music on this album, and I love both The Band and Bob Dylan, I still can't rate it 4 or 5 stars--If Planet Waves deserves 5 stars, then how many stars do Dylan's true classics merit?  No, compared to what Dylan and Bandmates were obviously capable of, Planet Waves is a 3 at best--worth checking out if you're a fan, but neither groundbreaking nor classic.<br /><br />The most obvious predecessor of Planet Waves is [[ASIN:B0000024WJ New Morning]]--the songs are, for the most part, happy and focused on Dylan's family life and love for his wife and children, and the mood is loose and laid-back.  However, New Morning had much more memorable songs.  When it comes to Planet Waves, there are a few songwriting highlights--\\"Forever Young\\" is an obvious classic, though Dylan made the inadvisable choice of sequencing two different versions right next to each other (why???), \\"Something There is About You,\\" is pretty good, and \\"Dirge\\" is an interesting, dark number that sounds atypical for Bob.  Sadly, the rest is pleasant enough, but really not memorable--except for \\"You Angel You,\\" in which Bob and The Band come out of their coma long enough to prove that they're not really zombie impostors.  You can listen to the album a couple times, then look at the track listing and notice song titles that you don't even remember hearing.<br /><br />Much as I love The Band, they don't really put on their finest show here either; the only member who really shines is Robbie Robertson, who lays down some pretty gnarly guitar lines on a few tracks.  Where is Garth Hudson, who *made* The Band's first three albums pure magic, but here sits far back in the mix, only playing organ, rather than the excellent piano, sax, etc. that he was capable of?  Likewise, Manuel's piano is pretty generic, Danko doesn't have strong songs to tie good basslines onto, Helm is stuck with boring mid- and slow-tempo songs, and, worst of all, Dylan only employs the amazing vocal harmony abilities of his backup band members on one or two songs.  Add to that Dylan's harmonica, which sounds like it's playing in a different key from whatever song it's soloing in, and you're left with a mix that leaves little impression.<br /><br />Planet Waves isn't a particularly BAD album, it's just not very memorable.  When you know the breathtaking heights of which its musicians are capable of, such an album is a disappointment.  Admittedly, there are a lot of people who find this album very enjoyable--more power to you if you do!  I've tried to appreciate it and can't find an insertion point.  If you're pretty new to Dylan's albums, this isn't a great place to start.  If you're already a fan of Dylan's and The Band's music, check it out--you might be one of the people who enjoys its carefree, loose blend of folk rock.  Probably the best way to appreciate it is not to expect anything too earth-shattering, and maybe you'll appreciate it as an album with some worthwhile small pleasures.tc. that he was capable of?

0965604926|4.0|Author Chang has taken on a monumental task in trying to bring into world-wide consciousness the murder, rape and humiliation visited on the Chinese population of Nanking by Japanese soldiers in late 1937 and early 1938.  Despite the fact that a number of Japanese officers were ultimately executed for these crimes after war crimes trials in both Nanking and Tokyo after the war, a number of political events of the time lessened the notoriety this horror deserved. While a very well done effort to cover the who, why and what of these crimes, the book falls in between being an encylopedic study of the events with strong fact-based research, and a simply ancedotal compliation of eye witness testimony.  A number of very graphic photographs give truth to the story, yet the reader is never really able to completely comprehend the impact of the murder of perhaps 300,000 people. This is not a criticism of author Chang, rather a recognition of how difficult it is to elicit complete understanding of events of this magnitude.  For those who are not immersed in the detailed history of Japanese actions in China prior to WWII, this is a very good book to begin an understanding.
B0006GVJEE|5.0|I'm sick of so-called \\"director's cuts\\" of films that add little to nothing to the initially released version of a particular film.<br /><br />The director's cut of Leon: The Professional is not one of those films. This is a perfect example of how a director's original vision can make the theatrical cut pale in comparison. Even though I must admit that I can understand why the cuts in the film were made, at the very least they weren't lost forever. With the added 24 minutes, this film becomes a completely different animal. There are scenes which might make some uncomfortable that deal with Natalie Portman's character but upon watching the film, I thought it played out very honestly and not like some sicko's creepy fantasy. I think talking about the extra additions to this film in detail could ruin the viewing experience so I'll leave it untainted for the first time viewer. I will say that if you haven't seen this version and you liked the thetarical version, you should make it a point to.<br /><br />Technically, this disc is solid on both audio and video. I believe the transfer is the exact same one as the Superbit release and the audio gets a DTS 5.1 track as well, so no complaints there. The special features aren't as in depth as I would've liked, with no input by Gary Oldman at all. There is a nice segment where Natalie Portman and Jean Reno are reunited and a trivia fact track that you can activate to play over the film.<br /><br />If you like this film, this is the version to see and own.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|I would have liked to hear more analysis of the actual effect CO2 has on <br />trapping heat.  Gore does a very interesting presentation of the  <br />historical concentration of CO2 compared to what it's doing these days, <br />and compares that to the historical record of temperature.  However, I <br />think it would have been nice if he included a brief scientific analysis <br />of exactly how much added insulating effect we could expect from X amount <br />of added CO2.  I realize Gore's presentation was geared to the masses <br />and one doesn't want to get too heavy into the science or math, and <br />perhaps the effect isn't well known accurately, but still, more about <br />that would have been good. <br /> <br />Other than that, this is a good illustration of global warming.  The <br />reall pitty is that we saw this coming some 30 years ago, but only now <br />are we really taking an interest.
0007205236|4.0|Angela's Ashes is an excellent autobiography that describes the life of Frank McCourt, the author, and how he survived his Irish Catholic childhood in Limerick, Ireland.  The author's perspective of his life of is very depressing, especially for the reader. The story is very deep in description, which brings the reader into the mind of the author. This also allows the reader to be continuously interested. <br />As being the winner of the Pulitzer Prize award, I would certainly recommend Angela's Ashes to anyone who is interested in learning about the lives of many Irish Catholic people during the 1930s. <br />
B00003CXMG|5.0|Cameron Crowe's (Jerry Maguire, Vanilla Sky) light hearted comedy drama about a young teen spending months traveling around with a bunch of big-ego rising rock stars really hits home. <br /> <br />The beginning of the movie starts off with a very creative way of listing out the credits via William (played by Patrick Fugit). From the start you know that music - more specifically rock 'n' roll - is very focused upon because all the ticket stubs from rock concerts and stickers as well. You next get to see how William's mom (played by Frances McDormand) is very controlling and strict...and Crowe likes to make point of that as often as possible throughout the movie. <br /> <br />After his older sister leaves with her boyfriend, and he also figures out that he is eleven years old in the seventh grade while everyone else is thirteen the movie skips four years until he's fifteen. But, before the flash-forward, William is instructed to look under his bed from his sister. He goes to find a collection of (what we now know) as some of the best rock albums of all time. He puts on The Who's \\"Tommy\\" and then flashforward 4 years. <br /> <br />Anyway, William becomes incredibly interested in Rock 'n' Roll as you next see him as a fifteen year old high school student sketching the hot rock bands of the time on his notebook. He then gets a little job offer from Lester Bangs (Phillip Seymor Hoffman) to write a small editorial on Black Sabbath because they were playing a show that night. At the show, William runs into Penny Lane (Kate Hudson) along with Stillwater (The blooming rock band) and hooks up with them. Afterwards, the movie picks up and the story starts to unfold. <br /> <br />As the movie goes on, you really get to see Kate Hudson fill in a role that was so made for her its scary...actually, she was made to be Penny Lane. Billy Crudup really shines as the \\"hey, I'm the good guy who'll befriend everyone\\" but who really has a lot of issues of his own. William Miller is the kidin all of us as we watch - very relatable to the viewers. Cameron Crowe really makes William a solid character as the only solid member of the whole tour. He is what a lot of us are like, at least I really relate to him. He is an innocent fan in a world of drugs, sex, and rock 'n' roll - all foreign to him. The way he really grows up in the movie is awesome, and one of the most enjoyable character developments I've seen.  <br /> <br />I really enjoyed this film overall. The acting was so dead-on, It was like watching a documentary. The soundtrack tops most all other soundtracks in recent memory. Led Zeppelin is the highlight band in the soundtrack, as songs like Tangerine and That's The Way are played a few times throughout. Actually, its been said that Stillwater (the fictitious band in the movie) is actually somewhat molded after Led Zeppelin. This is Crowe's best achievement to date - topping Jerry Maguire. I have to say that anyone who is a fan of classic rock, or is someone who has always been the odd man out...watch this film.  <br /> <br />5/5 Stars <br /> <br />I'm Will Black, and that's my review of Almost Famous.
B00005JLD4|4.0|This movie tells the story of three aborginal children who were kidnapped from their mother and taken to a faraway school in order to be indoctrinated into white Australian culture. This was the policy of the Australian government towards \\"half-caste\\" children, meaning those born with one parent who was white and one who was aborginal. In some ways it was similar to how the United States built schools intended to assimilate American Indians into mainstream white society.    The rest of the movie depicts how the three kids escape and then, with tremendous bravery and determination, make a 1,500 mile journey on foot to home. It's an extraordinary story that covers an important aspect of Australian history that remains unknown to many people. So, on that level, I enjoyed the movie.     But what keeps it from reaching the highest level of cinema is that the movie is basically a simplistic \\"morality tale\\" with very little nuance or subtly. Of course, the three girls are inherently heroic. But I would have preferred that the rest of the cast were portrayed with greater depth and a wider diversity of perspectives. Instead almost all the white Australians are depicted as simplistic villans, with a few bad \\"sell-out\\" aborigines thrown in for good measure.     History teaches us that the interaction of cultures involves a complex dynamic with a wide diversity of personalities and both sides generally attempting to do what is in their own self-interest. This holds true even when one side is clearly more powerful and therefore able to generally dominate and victimize the other, as was the case between whites and aborigines in Australia.    I still consider this a movie worth seeing. But I do wish the movie had a bit more depth to it, particularly in terms of character development.
B0000630BT|5.0|\\"Painkiller\\" showed Judas Priest,like other metal outfits at the time, burnishng off the synth-heavy glam-metal of their previous CDs(1986's \\"Turbo\\" and 1988's \\"Ram It Down\\")and returning to pure metal with more speed,heaviness and vengance than ever before.Only in this case the veteran band sounds completely revitalized rather than desparete.Rob Halford's voice hits ear-splitting King Diamond-like notes on \\"All Guns Blazing\\",\\"Metal Meltdown\\",\\"Night Crawler\\" and the pummeling title track,as K.K Downing and Glenn Tipton trade in fercious licks with then-current drummer Scott Travis revving up the tempo up to 150 mph,right up there with the best of Metallica,Slayer and Megadeth.This grand return would not last(Halford would leave months after to form his own band Fight and would not return until 2004),but \\"Painkiller\\" would remain one of the best metal albums of the 1990's and still sounds as brutal,powerful and intense as it came out,thanks to Jon Astley's sizzling remastering treatment.Not for the faint of heart,but its just what the doctor ordered for any metal fan who want it hard n' heavy!
B000050FEN|5.0|everything good you've heard about this movie is probaly true. its plot is undeniably good, the way its shot and done are awsome probaly the best ending ever. the scenes arnt as bad as somem people make them out to be but there still bad, the man comminting all of the seven deadly sins is a great actor and makes you think when hes in the car tlaking about why he does them, it puts that in a way he's right (he could do it a little less ruthlessly) but it definatly is worht every penny you spend for it and its one of the best to add to your collection.
B000KRNF3W|5.0|\\"Marbles\\" is simply a masterpiece; and if you are new in the Jazz Fusion or the music of John McLaughlin, this CD is surely \\"a must own\\".<br /><br />However if you are an old fan like me, please consider that all the music on this album already exists on a previous release called \\"Devotion\\".<br /><br />So basically I recommend this album to anyone that does not have \\"Devotion\\" in his collection. It is a true masterpiece.<br />Highly recommended.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|Al Gore's movie about the affects of climate change and global warming is less an enlightenment than confirmation for people that have followed the intellectual discourse on the topic. Gore provides commentary and evidence that confirms, rather than discloses, changing patterns of planetary warming and mounting chlorine in the atmosphere.<br /><br />Gore has apparently been going around the world giving a spiel on this topic for some time, using video and other evidence to support his presumptions. Since there is little real controversy about the topic any longer -- virtually every naysayer belongs to some organization supported by either energy providers or another group with a financial stake in denying these worldwide changes -- the film is less a revelation than a confirmation of what others have said and presented for years.<br /><br />The film is full of visions of snow-capped mountains with their snow melted, ice cap diminution at the poles, charts of increasing temperature and pollutants in the atmosphere, etc. It is topically presented in a nonscientific way that makes the film more of a pop art than documentary experience.<br /><br />What is missing from this film? There are some things, of course. Gore presents no evidence to support claims that chlorine in the atmosphere gravitates to the poles, which is why the hole in the ozone layer is worst at the South Pole. For this reason, Australians and New Zealanders are required to wear extra protection agains the sun's increasingly dangerous rays. There wasn't anything about this in Gore's movie.<br /><br />Still, it is evidenciary and entertaining, probably more so the former than latter. While many of my friends were overwhelmed by this movie in the same way \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" bowled them over, I was moderately entertained and impressed. I don't deny its message, I just don't think it's the greatest thing since indoor plumbing. I've seen and heard much of it before.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Move over Pierce Brosnan and Timothy Dalton. Daniel Craig is the best Bond in 20 years and has resurrected the franchise that was on life support.<br /><br />The first thing you notice about Casino Royale is that it is absent of all of the cheesy gimmickery of the old Bond movies. The stunts and effects are believable. The acting is understated and real. The plot is fresh and new.<br /><br />Daniel Craig's performance gives a hint of Sean Connery. But it's not an imitation of Connery. Craig makes the role his own. This is a whole new Bond. The cliche is that this movie is Bond for the 21st century (the terrorist angle), when it actually just brings Bond back to his roots. He is cunning more than he is charming. (unlike Roger Moore) He is different, he is new, he reinvents what you think a secret agent in her Majesty's secret service should be.<br /><br />If you are looking for the trademark Bond staples such as the Martini (shaken, not stirred) - the easy women, the endless supply of Aston Martins etc... this movie may disappoint. Craig is rough around the edges but just smooth enough to make you believe that he deserves to be the newest \\"double-oh\\".<br /><br />I suggest buying this DVD in 1080p Blu-Ray because of the spectacular cinematography, shot on location in Prague. It won't disappoint.<br /><br />The best part about the movie, without giving too much away, is that the ending leaves you wanting more. Isn't that the goal of any great series?<br /><br />I give it 5 stars.
B000002H33|5.0|While many say this is the greatest metal cd of all time, I dont agree but its diffently up there. This is Metallica the way they should be. All songs are classics and not a bad track on the whole cd. I wish they could recreate a cd like this nowadays.
B000LC55F2|5.0|I bought this partly because of the story line, and mostly because of the three leading male stars, Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Caine. A First Class, highly detailed period piece set in the most part in the UK, it portrays at first the professional friendship, then the falling-out of that friendship becoming a battle between two fanatically ambitious--and sometimes unscrupulous--magicians each trying desparately to be the \\"Top Billing\\" in the field.  A mistaken effort at daring-do takes the life of Jackman's wife on stage in a Houdini-like \\"water escape\\" illusion which causes the falling-out between Jackman and Bale.  Then the conflict begins between the two in one after the other \\"new\\" on stage illusions as one magician upstages the other, learning the \\"secret\\" of the other's trick and improves on it which only makes the rivalry more intense and ultimately more criminal in nature.  The script writers partnered with the director really did a class-act job on this film using a finely crafted \\"flashback\\" technique, leaving VERY subtle hints/links throughout the story line that--if you've been paying attention--all come together at the wholly unexpected plot twist during the climax.  Michael Caine should get a Best Supporting Actor for his part in The Prestige, which is more than entertainment because of the intense rivalry, darkening as the film progress until the \\"Film Noire\\" shock ending which leaves but one magician going forward BUT without learning the secret of his rival's better illusion...\\"The Prestige\\". HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for ADULTS ONLY, this is a DVD to both view and buy for your own collection.
B000002H97|4.0|Even if Enter Sandman is played too much on the radio, this cd still offers many heavy songs. My faviortes are Sad but True, Dont Tread on Me, and Holier then thou. I cant say im a big Metallica fan, but I did get the cds they released after this. Cant wait to see why people think they are so terriable nowadays.
0671027344|5.0|Let me start off by saying that this book has got to be if not the best one of the best books I've read on fiction. I had this book for quite a while, but never really took the time to actually read through it. Until I recently picked it up and started reading it, I was instantly hooked on it and couldn't stop reading until I had finished the whole novel.  <br />BEWARE: Don't be fooled by the novels name, it may sound like a stupid book, but it's anything but that. <br />Highly recommend reading it!
1400079276|2.0|Am I the only one who finds it rather childish?  Like so much Japanese literature/film/animation/stories it seems yet again the magical tale of a gifted child with exceptional powers of bravery, strength and vision, who no one else appreciates, but who will burn through in the end.  For a smart guy, Murakami needs to challenge himself a bit more.
1582701709|5.0|While cynics, skeptics, pessimists and detractors all spew negative ideas about the book, I've found it to be full of great information and very inspirational. These principles worked for Thomas Edison & will work for you. Since we live in a negative environment, especially the news (which I stopped listening to), this book sheds light on one of the greatest true secrets of life. It's amazing all the things that have taken place in my life over the past month since I've read this book and watched the DVD and applied the principles. I highly recommend getting both the book & DVD, and carrying this book with you wherever you go. Instead of reading the newspaper in the bathroom each day, read this book again & again. It will positively change your life in record time!
B00005JO20|5.0|Characteristic of the brilliant Peter Jackson,this is a long movie.But it's so packed with action that you don't really notice.The CGI guys did an awesome job at creating Kong and the creatures of Skull Island.They are so realistic and the scenes with the dinosaur stampede and where Kong defends Anne from the T-rex are breathtaking.The scenery is amazing(even though it is blue screen,it's still amazing).The natives are freaky.The story telling is great.Character developement is great.Script is excellent.Violence is just right-not too much,but enough to make it believable and interesting(that sounds terrible).And the relationship between Kong and Anne is beautiful-very developed and deep.Over all a great movie.
B00005JPGO|5.0|I had expectations before seeing this film from the reviews that it was going to be a good film - it way surpassed my expectations - both in the quality of acting , realistic locations , superb action scenes , historical accuracy , the indepth compassionate look at all sides involved in the history of Africa both black and white .  <br /> <br />Being a white Rhodesian ( Zambian not Zimbabwean in my case , but also lived in Zimbabwe and South Africa )myself and around at the time of the changes taking place in Southern Africa - I have to say that the accent of Leonardo DiCaprio was perfect and all credit to him for studying the phraseology and Rhodesian slang - how he did'nt get an Oscar beats me - perhaps the subject was too politically incorrect - I will be a Leonardo fan from this moment on .  <br /> <br />This film was more than just a look at the problems of Sierra Leone - but looked at in great detail for the first time from Hollywood at the plight of the lost white race of Africa and how much they too love the continent and would die for it . A MASTERPIECE that everyone should see and BELIEVE !!
B000001FMX|5.0|i had just lost my little boy, my husband of 19 years had recently left me for a woman 22 years my junior, and i had a horrible rash all up and down my left side. i was DEPRESSED! i wasn't the old me anymore. kicked by life one too many times, if you know what i mean. then i heard this album. and suddenly i wanted to wear lipstick again. i wanted to put on lipstick and go out dancing. i was back! thanks, new york dolls.
B000NA28I4|2.0|I was really looking forward to this movie when they announced it after becoming a fan of the novels but it was a terrible let down. The whole movie is a complete mess, it rushes so fast you're just sitting there wondering if they accidentally cut out parts in the editing room. The beginning of the movie was the worst; rush, rush rush! Can't believe they released it like this, no character developement, important parts in the book completely left out of the movie, you don't care about any of the characters. <br /> <br />The only thing I enjoyed a tiny bit was the Eragon/Shade battle, I LOVED the Shade character, but like everything else, it just flew right by leaving you wanting so much more. <br /> <br />Give me a 3 hour movie, break up book one into two films, either way is fine with me...but please, NEVER rush through a movie like this.
B000J3OTSM|3.0|At first sight \\"Step Up\\" looks like some of the recent films with a dance theme such as \\"Honey\\" or \\"You Got Served.\\" In fact, the story of \\"Step Up\\" reminded me of \\"The Cutting Edge,\\" where the chemistry of the two leads somehow manages to carry the implausible story to the end. In `Step Up\\" same thing happens. The film has beautifully choreographed dancing scenes, and its soundtrack is also impressive, but don't try to find unpredictable stories or Tarantino-like dialogues. <br /> <br />While doing community service at the Baltimore's art school, street dancer Tyler (Channing Tatum) offers his skills to help Nora (Jenna Dewan), aspiring ballet dancer whose dance partner got injured recently. Through the events that follow, such as reluctant permission given from Director Gordon (Rachel Griffith), Tyler finds himself attracted to Nora, or vice versa. And this sure-fire boys-meet-girls scenario works better than you expect thanks to the two leads with enough chemistry, natural personalities and dancing talent. <br /> <br />Choreographer-turned-director Anne Fletcher successfully combines two different types of dances in the film's concluding part with amazingly beautiful dances, but \\"Step Up\\" takes too much time to reach there. Unlike Baz Luhrmann's hilarious \\"Strictly Ballroom\\" many scenes of \\"Step Up\\" covers the materials such as car theft and street gang, topics that have been used in other films in a better way. With more dancing, \\"Step Up\\" would have stepped up one more notch higher or possibly more.
B000N3ST7A|4.0|Stevie Nicks is one of the last of the greats in pop/rock and roll music. Here is a woman who lived the mythical rock story: sex, drugs and rock and roll.  Besides that, though, she is an excellent singer/songwriter who undoubtedly had to deal with the male egos of both Fleetwood Mac and record executives.  She's one of the few female artists to find success in both a music group and solo career.  <br /> <br />This collection may not have all the original versions of her hits but the live verisons and remixes that do replace the originals are still worthy of a listen. The recent live version of \\"Rhiannon\\" is powerful, and hearing \\"Dreams\\" in a dance version brings this timeless song into the millennium.  It's a treat to hear the original \\"Silver Springs\\".  It's hard to believe this track was not included on the original pressing of \\"Rumours\\".  It's simply brilliant, and it's easy to understand why Nicks was upset that it wasn't originally included.  But at least this song is getting its due.  It's become an important part of Nicks' legacy.  <br /> <br />And there are so many more great songs: \\"Edge of Seventeen\\", \\"I Can't Wait\\", \\"Talk to Me\\", \\"Stand Back\\", and \\"Rooms on Fire\\".  <br /> <br />It would have been a perfect collection if this compilation included \\"Gypsy\\" and \\"Sara\\", two of Nicks' finest songs with Fleetwood Mac, but ultimately integral to Nicks' own career.  <br /> <br />Small quibbles aside, this is highly recommended.
B00018D44U|5.0|I love the sound of her voice, there is no other like it.
0786182466|3.0|i am not so impressed with the guy who reads this amazing story. he has won awards, apparently, but his voice keeps me from listening to this not-inexpensive set of disks. this was a complete waste for me, as i will probably never listen all the way through. this is my all-time favorite novel, though. i am very disappointed. i would give it one star, but i just cannot do that to JKT.
B000NA28IE|5.0|I loved this movie so much I sent copies to my children for their families.  They received the movie on Saturday, and by Tuesday each family had watched it three times.<br /><br />My adult children and grandchildren loved it too.
B000A7DVR2|4.0|Usually, I find modern comedies quite horrible and mostly unfunny.  But The Big Lebowski I find to be infinitely amusing. <br /> <br />Jeff Bridge's character is a subtle characterization of a bum who likes to drink White Russians and bowl, and I always find myself wondering what exactly is his source of income?  Can't help it, but force myself to suspend my disbelief.  Bridge's character is fundamentally interesting and it's fun just to watch him being 'Dude'.  In fact, this is a guy I would love to hang out with.  His assessment of the Eagles music alone made me want to buy this DVD! <br /> <br />Actually, you have to suspend a lot of your disbelief since this whole story is a ridiculous farce from the get go.  And that's quite OK. <br /> <br />One thing I like about it is that it doesn't seem to have been written as merely one 'gag' after another but smoothly flows from one ridiculous scenario to another that are all brilliantly tied in to the main story line...if there is indeed anything that can actually be called a story. <br /> <br />John Goodman was surprisingly hilarious.  I can't say enough about his character and how he handled it.  Truly one of the finest bits of comedic acting I have ever seen. <br /> <br />I found it interesting that the writers included a rather deep, touching human element concerning the friendship of Lebowski and his two friends without being trite or sickening. <br /> <br />The 'making of' portion was mildly interesting and featured mostly the Coen Brothers discussing the film. <br /> <br />Personally, the mere fact that I spent my hard earned money in buying a copy of a movie that is shown quite a bit on TV should convey how strongly I recommend those who like offbeat comedies. <br /> <br />I gave it four stars since even a great comedy such as this doesn't make me laugh as much the second or third time around.  It is for me just a fun, entertaining film to watch.
0374105235|5.0|I was really moved reading Ishmael's story.   Having lost his whole family and watched friends die at such a young age, you can't help but think how can anyone overcome such horror.  To be forced to learn to use an automatic weapon and expected to kill without reason, except what was told to you, is so disturbing.  Yet, with the help of UNICEF and the NGO, Ishmael was able to work through his anger and fears and found his spirit again.    He was very fortunate to have found wonderful people who were able to support him even when he thought he didn't deserve it.   Starting with his nurse at UNICEF and finally finding a new \\"mother\\" in NYC, he was able to finally see that there is good in the world and went on to college and is now involved in organizations that help to protect children from such atrocities.  He is a great example that you can, with the help of wonderful people, be at peace again and know that you are deserving of being in this world. <br />I recommend reading this book wholeheartedly.    <br />
B000M3452Y|5.0|This album is just brilliant. I wasn't a massive fan of his last album but I think this one is sheer brilliance. Some incredible stuff on this and it glows from start to finish.
B00000IFWE|4.0|It has been widely circulated that Petty wrote Echo during his emotionally draining divorce. It is easy to think this as the strain in Tom's relationship had long been informing his writing. <br /> <br />Tom states in his book - \\"Conversations with Tom Petty\\" - a fantastic read - that the songs for Echo were written when he was in a happy place having met Dana which must have given Tom great therapy in overcoming his mid life blues that had plagued him during his mid 40's. <br /> <br />It is undeniable that he draws from his painful experience in the songs however the strength and dignity within himself ensures his \\"I Won't Back Down\\" attitude prevails. <br /> <br />The Heartbreakers joined Tom for this album which was a terrific move with the band again resiliantly backing and enhancing Petty's tunes with Mike's guitar the barometer for Petty's mood and the last real notable contribution from the slowly deteriorating Howie Epstein. <br /> <br />The result is a fine rock album with several excellent written tracks among the very finest Petty penned. <br /> <br />Tunes such as \\"Room at the Top\\" and \\"Swingin\\" - singles in the US, shine with a most resiliant spirit with Petty in complete control. <br /> <br />\\"No More\\" \\"One More Day, \\"One More Night\\" and \\"Echo\\" bring out his mellow and reflective side with the title track one of the greatest performances ever by Tom Petty. He is up there with Dylan with the phrasing and shows alot more emotion on that track.  <br /> <br />Mike Campbell gets a rare gig with the enjoyable but should only have been performed live and not put on the album - \\"I Don't Wanna Fight\\". After a career of brilliance and loyalty, we can forgive him for that. <br /> <br />Echo spawned a great tour, it hit the US Top 10 and earned the band mostly nothing but praise and respect.  <br /> <br />Rock fans who appreciate great songwriters will not be dissapointed with this purchase, in my opinion you get to hear Tom close to his very best on several tracks with the whole album one fine rocking experience. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />
B000LPS4BG|4.0|You all know the plot of Goodfellas; so what makes this worth getting on Blu-Ray?  This is a great transfer to Blu-Ray - with the Aspect Ratio at 1.85:1 this movie fills the entire screen of a typical LCD/plasma.  Watching it again was like watching it for the first time.  The colors were brighter and the picture sharper.  A must have to start your Blu-Ray collection.
B00005JPCF|4.0|Ok, Happy Feet is weird. It is nothing like the other computer animated films that have been coming out, and is mostly a musical involving penguins and 80's music. Another interesting thing about this film is it's strong message on enviroment, extinction and other things like that, (maybe a bit odd for a childrens movie?) Overal though, this is some of the better family entertainment to come out, and that is why I give it four stars.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|This CD shouldn't be called \\"Love\\", it should be called \\"Drugs!\\"<br /><br />It's interesting that The Beatles are still kept alive all these years after their initial breakup.  And sadly, two of them had already died. But George Martin should be commended for keeping the Beatles appeal going.  My own 20 year old daughter has truly become a Beatles fanatic this past year especially since she got this \\"Beatles: Love\\" CD for Christmas.  She remembers watching Yellow Submarine when she was very young and, of course, she's heard me playing my Beatles CD's over the years too.<br /><br />What a unique collage this \\"Beatles Love\\" CD is.  I didn't take to it very well at first because I'm generally a purist and don't like to hear original recordings being altered.  But as I played this over and over, I began to appreciate it more.  It really puts The Beatles in more of a psychedelic euphoria of sound.<br /><br />Your mind will be trying to focus on 3 to 5 Beatles songs at one time and seem to wanna change recordings every 5 to 8 seconds.  Some songs almost play in their entirety, but what makes these remixes fun are when George Martin overlaps some segments of other songs.  It's really cool when you play this CD through headphones.  You can hear all the detailed efforts of the mixing and you'll realize that this was no easy project.<br /><br />So, with or without drugs, this concept is quite unique. I think George Martin can get away with making a \\"Beatles: Love, Part Two\\" sometime in the future.<br /><br />I think it would be cool if they did something like this with The Doors, too.
B00003CXCW|5.0|Sunset Blvd. (Billy Wilder, 1950)<br /><br />Sunset Boulevard is noir at its best, a simple story of obsessive love gone wrong, but the characters. Oh, the characters. Gloria Swanson plays Norma Desmond, a silent film queen who's been abandoned by the studios as talkies have become all the rage. (Swanson-- and her circle of card-playing friends in the movie-- were, in fact, silent film stars who had been abandoned by the studios after talkies became all the rage. Among the card players is Buster Keaton.) By coincidence, a young screenwriter, Joe Gillis (William Holden, in the first of his collaborations with Billy Wilder), pulls into her garage while fleeing repo men, thinking the place is abandoned. The two meet, and Desmond convinces Gillis to do some editing on a script she's been working on. Erich von Stroheim has a star turn as Desmond's butler, a silent film director also left in the lurch. (von Stroheim was, of course, a silent film director, whose Greed is widely considered one of the best films ever made.)<br /><br />With all the similarities to real life going on in this movie, it's hard to examine it without a lengthy diversion into the movie being a savage satire on Hollywood itself, but that's not what most struck me about this movie. It's Joe Gillis, possibly the least effective manipulator ever captured on a screen, a man who desperately needs to become hard-hearted to gain his independence from an ugly, overbearing relationship. It's Norma Desmond, already half-mad at the beginning of the movie, rolling the rest of the way off the cliff as she tries, just as desperately to hold on to Gillis. It's Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson), torn between her growing love for Gillis and her engagement to his best friend, Artie Green (Jack Webb), coming under the withering gaze of Desmond's scorn. It's Max the Butler, so proud and so pathetic, who understands exactly where Gillis' road is headed, but is powerless to do anything about it. It's Cecil B. DeMille, who didn't have to do anything other than play himself. Satire can't work unless you've got the fundamentals in place. And in this case, the fundamentals are the characters and how they interact. And they're fabulous. Sure, Wilder and collaborator Charles Brackett wrote a great script, and Wilder, as was his wont, filmed the whole thing with precision and flair, and it wouldn't be as good a movie without those qualities. But you could put these characters, with these actors playing them, on a bare stage with a single lightbulb, and let them improvise till the cows came home, and I believe the audience would have still been deathly quiet and stock still. This is genius, pure and simple. *****o didn't have to do anything other than play himself. Satire can't work unless you've got the fundamentals in place.

0763621579|5.0|It's my routine to buy the gift set - boardbook with plush toy if it's available because I can read the book while my child is holding the toy listen to the story.  <br />The story is simple, fun and age appropriate. I certainly hope I can find more book + toy gift set, so that we can have a good collection of reading and playing material.
B000KX0IOK|4.0|This is a measured (some might say slow), extremely gritty (hand-held, soft focus) film, grounded by a low-key, mesmerizing performance by Ryan Gosling.  At one point, during a heated conversation, Gosling's character  exclaims \\"I don't know, I don't know,\\" and it's pretty much a metaphor for the performance.  This is a lost man, anchored to nothing, desperately in need of a reason to live, let alone get up in the morning.  He's utterly ordinary, which makes his drug addiction that much more disturbing and sad; this could be your brother or best friend.  In supporting roles, Shareeka Epps and Anthony Mackie give superb, if less nuanced, performances.  It's all very real, down to the women cast as Gosling's love interests; not one is particularly attractive, as might be the case if this were a studio film.  But then if it were, the filmmakers would have been forced to wrap up this ambiguous tale in a feel-good, trumped up, utterly false coda.  Instead, we're left with unanswered questions and no clear idea what the future holds.  And that's Life.  And that's what makes \\"Half Nelson\\" so effective.
032147404X|5.0|This is a good book for all DSLR users, whether you are a pro or an amateur. <br /> <br />This is one of the book I would read over and over again.  The way it's organized allows you to read any topic (or page) without any sequence.  Of course, similar topics or techniques are grouped together in one chapter, e.g. photos for wedding. <br /> <br />Another good thing about this book is it doesn't go into a lot of of the technical theory aspects, it just tells you how to do it (or prevent it). <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to my friends who own a DSLR camera.

0061122416|4.0|This is a very simple book to read. There are no real complexities to the book.  The characters are one-dimensional and it could easily pass for a younger person's novel.  It is a quick, comfortable read.  It is simple, but don't we \\"adults\\" sometimes want and need that?    I am rating this 4 stars because of the way this book satisfies a need we all have sometimes to read that one type of story which makes us feel as if we could reach some higher destiny whatever it may be.  This book does just that.  You will enjoy the short, little aphorisms and insights (even if they don't seem to be accurate all the time) amidst a story of a journey following one's dream and struggling to achieve it.    In a world in which many lead cubicle, service-centric lives, wouldn't it be nice to escape in a story reminding you life was meant to be more than just \\"settling for anything\\" and destiny could possibly be achieved if only you kept persisting?  This one will.  I loved it for that.  You will too.    *****  THE BOTTOM LINE  *****  We all need to read books like this every once in awhile.  It may not be perfect, it may not be the most complex, but it satisfies the need to feel part of something larger than ourselves.  Don't we need that sometimes?  Don't you remember a time when that was important?
0471702188|2.0|I used this book for an MBA finance class but I am not keeping it as a reference.  I felt it was convoluted and badly organized.  It was difficult to look up subjects using the index when you wanted to just crack the book and find a formula or look for something specific.  Since that's what I would do if I kept the book as a reference, the value for me is not there.  I'm looking for a different book that is better organized and easier to understand for my reference book.

B000KX0IOK|3.0|I had heard good things about \\"Half Nelson\\", and when I saw that Ryan Gosling was nominated for best actor for his performance in the movie, I decided to rent it. It has some good parts, but too many flaws to be really satisfying. <br /> <br />The plot is very basic. It's about an inner-city school history teacher and basketball coach, Dan Dunne, who's struggling with a drug addiction. While struggling with various personal relationships, Dunne tries to stear one of his best pupils, Dre, away from Frank, a small-time drug dealer. Dre lives in a single-parent household, and her mother is away most of the time. Since her father never visits her, the only strong male presence in her life, other than Dunne, is Frank the drug dealer. More character-driven than plot-driven, the movie starts out good but then just wanders. To elaborate, I thought that the first 45 minutes were very well-done; it showed how Dunne is a natural leader in the classroom, even though the principal is none too happy with his lack of sticking to the assigned curriculum. In addition, I thought that it was going to be a documentary-style drama, in the vein of [[ASIN:B00008DDHZ Bloody Sunday]] or [[ASIN:B000GH3CR0 United 93 (Widescreen Edition)]]. I felt like I was a fly on the wall, observing the lives of Dan and Dre. Unfortunately, the movie loses focus in the second half. I kept expecting some kind of development to happen, but it never did. Is it going to be a movie about how Dunne overcomes his personal demons? There's some hint of that, but it wasn't explored enough to be convincing. Or is Half Nelson supposed to be about how he learns to bond with the students? That angle wasn't even explored, except for his relationship with Dre. As for Dre, is the movie about her move away from Frank? This is explored, but the resolution of the issue was not convincing. Finally, I wasn't looking for a \\"happy ending\\" at the end, but I was looking for some kind of closure. In other words, the movie doesn't endso much as it stops. Frankly, the only thing that kept the movie from unraveling was Gosling's performance. Shareeka Epps, who plays Dre, is definitely promising, but not in Gosling's league. <br /> <br />Overall, I would say \\"Half Nelson\\" is worth watching, particularly if you enjoy dramas about inner city schools or drug addiction. Plus, viewers of the left-wing persuasion will likely be pleased with Dunne's teaching the students the dialectical method of history. I was just too disappointed with the 2nd half of the movie to give this a strong recommendation.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I have NEVER written a review for any DVD before but I am compelled to share my comments about this one.  I listened to The Eagles as a teenager in high school, have always liked their music, and over the years I have enjoyed all kinds of different bands.  The Eagles had somewhat faded from memory but I still remember their fine music so when I saw this DVD in the store a while back, I figured I'd check it out.    I have a great 50\\" plasma TV and a very good 5.1 surround sound system but when I popped this disc in my standard DVD player, I never expected images and music to be so clear!  This is the \\"cleanest\\" DVD video I have ever seen.  It borders on HD quality....free from compression artifacts and video noise.    The first time I watched it, I set my audio system to play the DTS soundtrack on the disc and the only thing I can say is that I was TOTALLY MESMERIZED!  The videography, sound mixing quality, and performance is enough to put you in a zone.  These guys are true professionals of the trade and it shows!  Even at their age (50+), I found them to sound better than I remembered them in their earlier days.  Vocals and instrumentals are spot-on.    It was 9 months ago that I bought this DVD and I'm sure I have watched it at least three dozen times by now.  I never seem to get tired of it so when I have an overly stressful day at work, I just pop it in, turn down the lights, and enjoy.  It still mesmerizes me to this day.    If you like music, appreciate true talent, and want to see one of the best mastered DVDs ever to come out, I recommend that you buy this disc.  You will not regret it!  It just may turn out to be the best one you own....it sure did for me.
0385720920|3.0|I'm going to keep this review short and simple. My guy friend recommended it to me because he said it was the best book he ever read, after Fight Club. As a teenage girl, however, it was very difficult to get through this book. Don't get me wrong - Palahniuk is one of the most unique and innovative writers of our time. However, unless you are an adolescent guy, this book will most likely be extremely hard to bear. The humor, style, and subject matter I cannot relate too, thus turning me off to any sort of plot that existed. THIS IS A GUY BOOK. The one book I would recommend of Palahniuk's that girls can also enjoy because of its deeper, more existential themes is Fight Club.

B0002DB0FO|2.0|I had high hopes for this series after all I'd read and heard, but found it to be disappointing.  The premise of the story is good.  I pretty easily was able to get into the plot and care about the characters, and can see why Everwood has its following.    BUT, there is so much not to like.  For one--the narrating.  It's corny, it's trying to be philosophical, trying to make this show into something greater than it is.  It's a bore.  I hear that they ditched it in future seasons.    Second--and my biggest criticism--it's clear that the writers had an agenda from the start.  Just in season one alone, they covered \\"safe\\" sex, surrogate motherhood, medical marijuana, [...], and abortion.  These things weren't touched on subtely.  They were thrown in your face, all with a far left slant, with the possible exception of abortion, where both doctors struggled with it.  But wouldn't you know, the more conservative of the two actually performs it.  Yet another statement made.    Third, there is not enough humor, and what little there is, usually isn't that funny.    The relationships are very soap-like--on one day, off the next.  It was exhausting trying to keep up, and became something of a frustration.  I ended up hoping Amy stayed with Colin, and Ephram with Laney, but finally in the end, I ceased to care anymore.  And this, just after the first season!  I know they dragged that saga out for the duration of the series.    The acting is only average for TV, which isn't good.  Treat Williams was especially substandard.  I thought the best was the actor who played Bright.  There are some very likeable characters, which is pretty much what kept me watching.  But some characters were exaggerated to the point of being comical, while others were understated.  It was hard to get a feel for the tone of the series.    It took me awhile to build up empathy for Ephram, who was incredibly rebellious and mouthy.  Call me old school, but I don't think, even in his situation, he had reason to yell and cuss like that at his dad.  That, along with the liberal slant to all social issues, made me wonder why on earth this is considered a family show.    Season 1 ends with a heavy duty cliffhanger involving Colin, and no further seasons were sold on DVD.  I've been told that Season 1 was the best, so if that's the case, I don't see much reason to invest any more time in this series.

Get it girl, your songs are annoying and irritating and it's obvious in this album you're also trying to sing/sound like Marc Anthony...stop!  You obviously have no style that's why you keep trying to copy others and wouldn't be surprised if you'll be trying to copy Shakira's moves!!  Please no more pretend music and recording studio exec...QUE HICISTES?? Even the album's title is awkward!!

Sometimes the valley is low, but once we manage to climb to the valley's high, we are more patient, compassionate and understanding towards humanity, knowing that the quality of life is more valuable than one could ever image.

B00005JO20|4.0|I went to this film with mixed expectations. On the one hand, it was a Peter Jackson film (Lord of the Rings), so I knew it would have high production values. On the other, with all the hype and over $200 M budget, I knew it was bound to be typically formulaic, slick Hollywoodland fare. As it turned out, it was formulaic and slick, but also an extremely entertaining roller coaster ride of a movie.<br /><br />When it starts out, we are treated to a wonderful re-creation of depression era New York City, a tip-of-the-hat to the original 1933 Marian C. Cooper film. We meet renegade filmmaker Carl Denham - played without distinction by comedian Jack Black - who realizes he's considered washed-up by his business associates and has to come up with a way to redeem himself. He discovers out-of-work actress Ann Darrow - played enchantingly by Naomi Watts - and talks her into going with him on an old freighter to Singapore, where he says he will be shooting his next film. In reality, he's headed for Skull Island, a mysterious, undiscovered place the superstitious crew have heard of and are convinced they won't return from. At this point, everything seems tame and predictable - but nothing could be further from the truth.<br /><br />Carl Denham has a plan to salvage his career, and he's willing to stoop to any level and sacrifice anybody to do it. He has mislead his leading lady; kidnapped his writer, playwright Jack Driscoll - well played by Adrien Brody; deceived the ship's captain, Englehorn - played decently by Thomas Kretschmann; and is fleeing his associates, his creditors and the law. Carl is an opportunist, a user and a liar, which was not true of the original Carl Denham. Everyone on board the freighter is ready to part company with the conniving showman, especially the captain, when they enter a fog. Where they end up - fortuitously for Denham - is Skull Island.<br /><br />Now the tone changes. The first thing our little party of filmmakers experience is an horrific ordeal with the island's natives, perhaps the most blood-curdling depiction of devil-worship ever. Now we realize what we're in for - but it's too late to extract ourselves because we're hooked. We, like Denham, have to find out what's beyond the great wall the natives have built.<br /><br />After Kong steals the sacrificed Ann, we follow him into the jungle and find out that it's a prehistoric world, untouched by civilization. One of the most enjoyable scenes is when the filmmakers and crew come across some grazing dinosaurs. Something spooks them, and the herd starts stampeding in the direction of our party. They try to get away, but soon find themselves all mixed in with this pell-mell mob, dodging giant feet and teeth and rushing headlong down a hill as the monsters step on and fall over each other. They finally come to the bottom of the hill, which ends in a hairpin turn over a cliff that many of them fail to negotiate - and so over they go. Then the cliff starts collapsing under the weight of all those gigantic beasts and people - so more go over. It has to be one of the most exciting scenes ever filmed.<br /><br />One of the least enjoyable scenes is when our party find themselves in a swamp, being attacked by giant bugs. The filmmakers used every means at their disposal to terrify and gross us out. When I saw that scene, I knew I would not be purchasing the DVD. It was too much and unnecessary.<br /><br />There were other thrilling scenes in the jungle, as well as touching scenes between the beauty, Ann, and the beast, Kong. When she tries to get on the good side of Kong by entertaining him with some of her vaudeville routine, it is both funny and pathetic. But of course, by this time, we're ready to get back to New York City with Kong and see what happens when he escapes.<br /><br />Once he's been captured, the filmmakers whisk us away to Times Square and the theater where Kong is going to have his big debut. This part of the film reminded me a lot of Phantom of the Opera. It was very effective, with Kong, of course, escaping and reeking havoc in Times Square. I loved the yellow cabs. A fun touch was having Kong find Ann, and together go rollicking through Central Park, ending on a frozen pond where they play around on the ice.<br /><br />The final scene on the Empire State Building is good, but as Naomi Watts is continually trying to climb to the top of the building to be with Kong, and he is continually trying to place her somewhere safe, I'm thinking, \\"He's got more sense than she does.\\" Nothing in the film explains her obsession with him, or her lack of fear climbing up the Empire State Building. The biggest disappointment of all was when Kong was finally killed by the attacking airplanes, and falls to the streets below. I didn't feel any pity for him. I didn't feel anything, and I'm a big lover of animals and a big crybaby at movies. I was really stunned by this, that the filmmakers had failed so completely to move me.<br /><br />For special effects and a good visual roller coaster ride, this movie is a success. As far as a good story with well-developed characters, interesting dialogue and meaningful plot, it is a flop. Once again Hollywoodland has proven that a big budget doesn't guarantee a great movie. Story, script and acting do.<br /><br />Waitsel Smitha lot of Phantom of the Opera. It was very effective, with Kong, of course, escaping and reeking havoc in Times Square. I loved the yellow cabs.

B00005JLKB|5.0|I was a really, really hard sell on this series, mainly because I didn't start at the beginning, which is critical.  I'll spare you the dull details of how I came to purchase season 1.  Suffice it to say that I now publicly retract every bad thing I ever said about Smallville.     This is an excellent show that appeals to all ages, both genders, comics fans or not, Superman fans or not.  The series builds on itself, and each subsequent season gets still better.  The first season is mostly freak-of-the-week, as Clark discovers his super-abilities and tries to understand them.    The Pilot is super and had me not only engaged, but loving the characters.  I still find Lana a bit annoying at times, but have sort of grown used to her.  My entire family, ages 8 to 53, half girls, half guys, love this show.    The casting of Tom Welling, Michael Rosenbaum, Allison Mack, Annette O'Toole, John Schneider, and John Glover, was genius.  They are all absolutely perfect in their roles.  Season 1 doesn't showcase Tom's acting talent as well as future seasons when Clark's journey grows in complexity, but he is still exceptional, very likeable, believeable, and gorgeous, much like the young Christopher Reeve.   He was a new actor when Smallville started, so it's neat to see him grow and improve over the years, the most notable leap made between the second and third seasons.    Feature film quality special effects and stunts abound.  The manipulation of time during action is truly fascinating, wherein time is slowed almost to a standstill so that we can actually see what Clark is doing (as he moves so fast!).  I love watching Clark and bullets, either standing there taking them, catching them in his hand, or dodging them in slow motion.    All in all, GREAT show.  Some episodes are stronger than others, but that's typical.  My favorites were the Pilot, Hourglass, Nicodemus, Stray, Tempest.  Least favorites were Hothead, Cool, Craving, Shimmer, Crush.  Even in the weaker episodes, though, the B-story makes it worth watching.  The Luthors always keep you guessing!    Special features in this set are okay.  The tour of Smallville is too brief.  The Storyboard was interesting, but by far the best of the extras are commentaries on the Pilot, Metamorphosis, etc.  Those are truly fascinating, and everyone is so honest about what worked and what didn't, and the problems they ran into during shooting.  Some of these are tricky to access, tho.  You have to go down to the tiny arrow next to \\"main menu\\" and select it.    I was going to give season 1 four stars, just to allow for an even better season 2 and 3, but it deserves five.  Future seasons deserve ten!
0783110871|1.0|Too bad I can not give Turbulence no stars.  This movie is just filled with way too many things that just stretch even the most liberal imaginations well past the limits of reality!  The whole movie just does not work.  The FBI agents are too easily overcome and out smarted by a self professed genius serial killer whose one dimensional actions make his IQ seem incredibly average to me.  Rather than being very smart the serial killer seemed a self absorbed slob who is overly impressed with his own lame exploits.  The rest of the airplane passengers seem like fawns or sheep.  Logic suggests when transporting a dangerous horde of hardened criminals the crew would be a select group of individuals hand picked for their skill at dealing with a plane full of diseased brilliant minded malefactors.<br /><br />The plot is obviously concocted to introduce fawn like ladies and foppish men into the mix so the audience has a heightened thrill factor.  Problem is the other non-law enforcement passengers seem inserted into the plot for no good reason other than their role as pawns to be used by the serial killer to drag an otherwise painfully predictable lifeless story along to its all too formulaic end.  Also the Christmas lights festooned all over the plane when you are carrying hardcore prisoners is so over the top that you must wonder what the heck were the writers thinking.  Most hardcore prisoners are quite intelligent and could certainly turn all those dangling Christmas lights to their advantage in some vile criminal way.  No FBI agent or corrections officer  worth his or her salt would let a prisoner set foot in a plane that had so many opportunities for prisoners to escape their direct care custody and control.<br /><br />Also the most glaring flaw in Turbulence occurs when even the most basic tenants of maintaining care custody and control of violent malignant inmates were overlooked again and again.  The Plane skimming over buildings through rooftops into structures was just plain stupid.  While most tall buildings roof top garden rooms and associated elements are lightly constructed they must stand up to high winds.  Add that buildings the plane was scraping had mechanical equipment towers where strong girders and supports reside that should have broken the plane up or at least damaged it more than was shown.  It is like the writers of Turbulence were a bunch of college drama students drunk and totally detached from reality got challenged to come up with a disaster thriller plot.  Drama for drama's sake without any plausible relationship to reality is not thrilling or action adventure it is just disjointed stupid garbage.  Turbulence is just garbage to watch when you have time to waste.  If you want real suspense on a plane get Air Force One.  Turbulence is an invitation to take a round trip to and from Palooka-Ville, the plane has plenty of seats available but who cares!. This Turbulence is just a bumpy ride that leaves you feeling sick.  I can think of better ways to spend time.uctures was just plain stupid.

B000IHY146|3.0|I took a gamble and got this album on the strengh of the rave reviews and favourable comparisons to other acts I like. The artist is also recommended by one B.Dylan, a certain N.Cave and others. I have to say I am always wary of artist endorsements since I feel they will often be looking at some quality in the music as it relates to their own or may be just know the person. <br />My initial reaction as the first track hit me was WOW the gamble paid off, very different voice and a wonderul delivery, almost cracking with emotion on each note, one of the most amazing performances I've heard in quite some time.Unfortunately I would have to say only a few other tracks match it. <br />It perhaps isn't made clear elsewhere that there is no self-penned material on the album so track selection is crucial.Her voice doesn't suit all the songs chosen and the comparisons to Billy Holiday, whilst I can see certain similarities, are a little over-done. <br />This is NOT a slating;I do not regret buying the album as the best songs are well worth the purchase price, just don't expect \\"a great lost album\\" or you may be disappointed. <br />A final word on the packaging, while the music is paramount and such matters count for little if it is lacking, it must be said the CD is beautifully presented, the chunky cardboard sleeve comes  with a substantial booklet featuring informative notes and some nice photos.
B000001GQU|5.0|Ferenc Fricsay, the first music director of the RIAS Symphonie Orchester Berlin, is described in the liner notes as a deeply religious musician who was absolutely determined not to make this Verdi Requiem recording sound operatic. Well, I'm not sure he succeeded, at least not to this listener's ears.  <br /> <br />The reason: the fast tempos. <br /> <br />At 75'28\\", this is undoubtedly one of the fastest Verdi Requiems on record. Perhaps the conductor thought this would provide a more spiritual sound, but in fact the opposite has taken place. The breakneck speed has instead amplified the very operatic drama that Fricsay was trying to suppress, resulting in one of the most electrifying readings of the Verdi Requiem around. <br /> <br />I was hesitant about the turbo-charged Dies Irae since I adore the choral and brass work. But to my delight, the lighting tempo really worked. The notes whizzed past my ear, of course, but I was still able to catch all the overwhelming power that Verdi intended. <br /> <br />The only part where I thought the fast tempos didn't work was in the Agnus Dei. This has always been a point of repose for me in a work already brimming with excitement. But Fricsay's Agnus Dei just sounded too rushed and frantic for my taste. <br /> <br />In general, I found the soloists quite satisfactory. However, I thought Helmut Krebs' \\"Ingemisco\\" sounded a bit lightweight. \\"Ingemisco\\" is a plea for divine rescue from undying hellfire. But it sounded more like an Irish ditty by John McCormack. <br /> <br />The recorded sound is 1953 mono, but still works well. The pronunciation is literally a mixed bag: the chorus sings in Italian Latin, but the soloists use German Latin (requiem \\"ray-kvee-em\\", luceat \\"loo-tse-at\\").  <br /> <br />This is a very, very exciting rendition of the Verdi Requiem that is sure to inspire repeated hearings. On top of that, it is available at a budget price. Liner notes include texts and translations and some interesting history behindthe recording. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
B00005ASOI|3.0|\\"Suspiria\\" is a well-guarded secret among the intelligentsia of horror fans.  If you aren't part of the Algonquin Round Table of literate fright freaks or clued in to the subtle genius of its palette, then you will probably be one of those people who watch it, scratch your head, and then say, \\"I thought this was supposed to be one of the greatest horror films of all time.\\"<br /><br />It's not, let's be clear.  It exists, now, as a relic of what may once have been frightening (I have the impulse to debate that, but we'll skip it), a fossilized remnant of a time when sheer style and technique were enough to sow, grow, and harvest goosebumps by the bushel.  Fans of this film point at the subtle interplays of the editing, the almost painfully raw use of color, the \\"greatest horror movie score of all time,\\" provided by \\"Goblin.\\"  Although there's a lot of room for interpretation in the term \\"horrific,\\" it is clear to see the eye of a maestro at work in \\"Suspiria.\\"  The directing, cinematography, and editing are indeed eloquent.  The primal color scheme -- while over-the-top -- denotes an eye for craftsmanship, its unrealistic and powerfully savage primacy as tangible in the movie as any character or prop.  But there are problems here, too.  Lots of them.  Not the least of which being the story.<br /><br />Suzy Bannion (played by Jessica Harper, a woman whose fine features and big, beautiful eyes make her look like a Japanime character) travels to Germany to start her schooling at one of the most celebrated ballet academies in Europe.  Before she's even walked in the door, strange things occur, and it is up to Suzy to figure out what is going on ... before it's too late!  The elements that are intended to multiply the movie's horror tend (at best) to confuse and (at worst) to bring the pace of the film to a withered crawl.  Statues disappear, animals become strangely aggressive, footsteps clack off to rooms unknown, and eyes hover in the dark.  Meanwhile, there's stilted dialogue to be endured, and long, trawling shots of people walking...very...slowly.<br /><br />I consider myself a patient man, especially with things like movies.  And the opening murder sequence leads one to expect from the rest of the film a slow, hissing reveal (it also sets the tone for a fever dreamish reality; the building in which it takes place looks like it was designed by a post-mortem Erno Rubik, and all of the blood involved appears to be sherbert-colored poster paint).  But by the time maggots and strange bats begin to haunt the school, it was clear that not nearly as much effort had been put into the story as had gone into its well-lit props.<br /><br />Still, I can appreciate serious stabs at serious art, and I was sorely tempted to give the film a four star pat on the back (a round up from the C+ I feel it deserves), if it weren't for one thing: the score.  That's right.  In every glowing recommendation I ever read, in every Top Ten Scariest Movies Of All Time list in which \\"Suspiria\\" is listed, I heard about this supposedly powerful and unparalleled musical soundtrack to horror.  Call me uncultured.  Call me short-sighted.  But all I heard was an obtrusive, inconsistently employed, and unnecessarily shrill series of screeches and moans.  Normally music to movies is like salt to soup.  \\"Suspiria\\"s soundtrack is so grating and weirdly wielded that it seems like it's trying to be its own story altogether, forget highlighting or intensifying the movie to which its attached.  There are moments when it works (the opening driving sequence and the final \\"battle\\"), but many more when it doesn't.<br /><br />Fear is a sticky wicket; there's no accounting for tastes.  One thing I do know: if you are a buff of the horror movie genre (or a film student) and you haven't seen \\"Suspiria,\\" I recommend you watch it, if for no other reason than to see the trippy tricks that are possible when a director gives the screen his undivided attention.  But don't expect to bescared or disturbed.  And to the rest of you, I'd say steer clear.  It's true that there's a lot of visual art to this movie, but much like the art you hang on your wall, this flick goes nowhere.xpect to be scared or disturbed.

B00005MAM2|5.0|It is 2019, 31 years after World War III, and the citizens of Neo Tokyo are plagued by crime, gangs, and terrorists. A teenager named Kaneda is the leader of his own motorcycle gang, and weakling member Tetsuo is one of his closest friends. On what seems like a typical night for the group, they find themselves in a high-speed battle with rival gang \\"The Clowns,\\" but the night takes a frightening turn when they cross paths with a powerful, mysteriously aged child moments after his adult companion is gunned down in the street. Kaneda and his gang soon find themselves in the hands of the police, and Tetsuo, injured, is taken away by no less than the army. Tetsuo escapes from their clutches with the help of some newfound psychic powers, but when the gang is reunited, it's clear that their old friend is not well. Plagued by pain and hallucinations, not to mention years of frustration from always having to be rescued by Kaneda, Tetsuo is slowly becoming something no one can predict or trust. He is soon recaptured by the military, as Tetsuo has become a very important and dangerous part of the secret Project Akira. Meanwhile, Kaneda has troubles of his own. His attraction to a young girl he met at the police station has led him into the dark underworld of anti-government terrorism. It seems the new paths of Kaneda and Tetsuo are linked, though. When Tetsuo escapes again with thoughts of discovering the mysterious child called \\"Akira\\" on his mind, Kaneda decides he must try to save his friend once again, before his ever-growing powers completely overtake him.     \\"Akira\\" is one of those films anyone with even the slightest interest in Japanese animation, AKA Anime, has at least heard of. It's widely known as THE \\"must see\\" Anime film. One need only see the \\"Production Report\\" (making-of featurette) in this 2-disc Special Edition to understand why. The amount of work and attention to detail put into this animated feature is phenomenal! Katsuhiro Ôtomo explains in the featurette, and in the included interview, all that went into the production of the 1988 film, which is based on his comic series started in 1982. The film is a fascinating and dark tale of post-apocalyptic, urban survival and evolution. While not hard to follow, some details may feel left out here and there (perhaps to be found in the pages of the long running graphic work), and aspects of the ending can be seen as slightly unclear. However, the excellent production values, including the most fluid animation I've seen from Japan and the most widespread on the picture screen, along with Disney style pre-animation voice recording, heart-pounding action and music, excellent performances, and no fear in the violence and gore department, will likely please most viewers to no end! Akira is Anime eye-candy at its best, except for one crucial factor: No gorgeous, big-eyed schoolgirls! Oh, well. This DVD 2-disc Special Edition has so many extras, it's about to explode! In addition to the Production Report and creator/director interview, we get a thorough glossary, an unbelievably huge gallery, sound topic clips and restoration topic clips, and a load of trailers too! This DVD set is on par with and in some ways an improvement over the typical Disney Platinum Edition release of one of their films (and this is coming from a Disney fanatic). I WISH Disney's \\"making of\\" featurettes were like this one, showing the creators actually working on the film rather than the after-the-fact stuff Disney has been giving us lately. Presented here in widescreen with subtitle, dub, and original language options, and even a capsule info version, \\"Akira\\" is undoubtedly a must own for fans of Anime, but also for animation and film fans in general. It's not like your typical animated feature, and not even like your typical Anime feature. \\"Akira\\" is something all film fanatics must experience!

B000NA77YO|4.0|All right!  Time for my two cents!  When they fired Ozzy (at Iommi's behest) as the frontman of Black Sabbath back in 1979 after the torturous Never Say Die album, the three remaining Sabs had a dilema and some pretty big shoes to fill.  Could Ozzy Osbourne, the face and voice of Sabbath, actually be replaced?  Was that doom in the air?  Well....in walks singer Ronnie James Dio (because of advice given to the Sabs from future Ozzy wife Sharon Arden Osbourne)staight off a stint with Richie Blackmore's Rainbow and Heaven And Hell is born.<br /><br />Now there are strict Ozzy fans and there are strict Dio fans and there are some who love them both.  I am the latter.  Sabbath with Ozzy was ground-breaking and essential to the livlihood of Heavy Metal with more killer, classic tunes than you could possibly imagine (along with some real stinkers as well)and a legacy that sill holds true today.  And then there were The Dio Years...  What Ozzy and Sabbath did together over the span of 9 years all culminated with the addition of Ronnie James Dio as Sabbath's new frontman.  The new Sabbath was more refined, concise, and straight-forward.  Heaven & Hell and Mob Rules combine to make up a lot of Sabbath's best tunes.  Now....Ozzy freaks chillax! The stuff with Ozzy was classic!  No denying that, but through Technical Ecstasy  and Never Say Die, Sabbath lost a lot of ground (mass amounts of cocaine will do that to you). The Dio Years were very fruitful, no matter how short(no pun intended)and scattered they were.  But we knew it would never last.  If the Sabs couldn't get along with happy-go-lucky Ozzy, what made them think that they would do better with egomaniac RJD?<br /><br />Let's see what they gave us for a song catalogue on this newly remastered compilation:<br /><br />Neon Knights -  Awesome!  Great opener.  Heavy and rocking.  This cements the new Dio sound on Haven & Hell from the start.  A classic.<br /><br />Lady Evil - An often overlooked tune.  Mystical.  Heavy.  The swords and sorcery aspect that Ronnie brought to Rainbow transcends to Sabbath well.  Great bass riff by Geezer.<br /><br />Heaven And Hell -A staple.  Must have tune.  Dio never stopped doing this one live for twenty years or more after, even though he hated the Sabbath dudes for a long time.  Signature. Classic.<br /><br />Die Young - Great Iommi riffs.  Definitely not worth omitting the studio version of Children Of The Sea for.  Still a killer, often misplaced tune.<br /><br />Lonely Is The Word - I prefer Wishing Well to this song but who am I to complain.  This song drags just the tiniest bit.<br /><br />The Mob Rules - They went out of order here for some unknown reason, putting Turn Up The Night after this song.  Obviously a classic.  Great tune filled with energy and anger.  Beautiful.  Dio belts it out.  A snipet of this tune was in the animated clasic Heavy Metal back in the day.<br /><br />Turn Up The Night - Great opening song to Mob Rules.  Eerily reminiscent of Neon Knights.  The remastering kicks out the older version's bass-heavy overtones, giving it a much cleaner feel.<br /><br />Voodoo - Another Dio/Sabbath classic.  As with some of the other tunes offered here, it's great to finally hear the remastered version.<br /><br />Falling Off The Edge Of The World - Another hidden gem.  This over-looked tune is an all out rocker.<br /><br />After All (The Dead) - When Sabbath reformed in '92 with Dio at the helm, the album was called Dehumanizer and I gotta tell ya, it wasn't very pretty.  The three songs they included here could have made room for the missing classics like Sign Of The Southern Cross and Country Girl.  Hell, even Slipping Away would have been better.  Now, of the slop that was Dehumanizer, they did include three of the better songs.  After All is dark and increibly heavy (as was most of Dehumanizer) but it's still a decent tune.<br /><br />TV Crimes - The best of the Dehumanizer songs, still not as good as anything from Heaven & Hellor Mob Rules. But I like it.<br /><br />I - Dark, eeire, with a strange mix of emotions and guitar riffs.  Not a personal favorite, I would have prefered Letters From Earth, but hey.  I didn't make this compilation.<br /><br />Children Of The Sea - This is the live version from Live Evil.  Even with the remastering, this album still sounded off.  By the time Live Evil came out, the Sabs were in a full-scale war with each other.  Iommi and Dio were ready to kill each other and the results can easily be heard on this recoring.  According to rumors (from both sides) Iommi snuck into the mixing studio to boost his sound and cut down on Dio's vocals and vice versa.  What you have is a very badly mixed album either way.  The studio version would have defnitely been better at all costs!<br /><br />The final three songs will be lumped together.  The Devil Cried, Shadow Of The Wind, and Ear In The Wall are all pretty much filler to round out the playing time on this complation.  Newly recorded, as most bands do to give the fans somethng new to chew on, these songs sound like rejects from Dehumanizer.  Heavy.  So dreadfully HEAVY.  It's like ODing on Nyquil when you listen to them.  This compilation could have definitely benefitted from their omission.<br /><br />There you have it.  The fnal word?  Overall, this is Sabbath with Dio!  Some really great stuff here and a few stinkers.  But the good outweighs the bad by a huge margin.  I still miss Sign Of The Southern Cross the most and Country Girl which is one of my personal favorites, but this will do until they just remaster all the Dio stuff in the U.S. (there are the imports, of course) including the solo albums like Holy Diver and The Last In Line.  Definitely, this CD is worth the cash, if just for the Remastered versions of the early stuff.<br /><br />Dig it!.  Not a personal favorite, I would have prefered Letters From Earth, but hey.

0312265859|3.0|I have listened to the majority of the Stephanie Plum series on audio, narrated by talented voice actress C.J. Critt.  Ms. Critt does a fantastic job with the voice characterizations, but even she could not make this a truly good story. I found this book a little \\"darker\\" and less humorous than the previous seven in the series. Stephanie began to get on my nerves in places. I enjoyed getting to know Ranger better and he has an even bigger share of this book than Joe Morelli. This is not a bad book and I will keep reading the series; however, this story is not as clever as some of the other Evanovich books.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|I purchased this DVD as a gift for my parents and they truly enjoyed the movie and all the bonus features.  I personally haven't watched the DVD, but since my opinionated parents raved about it, it is probably very good.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|I have never seem them before, saw this on tv and I thought they were great. The music was superb. The lady violinist was incredible. I had to order the DVD right away.
B000002UAX|5.0|The Beatles also known as The White Album is probably the most diverse and experimental from their catalogue. Standout tracks include: Back in the U.S.S.R, Dear Prudence, Glass Onion, Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da, Piggies, Blackbird, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Long, Long, Long, Helter Skelter, Honey Pie, Cry Baby Cry, Martha my Dear, and Happiness is a Warm Gun. Every one gets a chance to shine, even Ringo who sings two tracks, Don't Pass Me By and the album closer, Goodnight. Paul's material is more relaxed and simpler while John's writing is more confessional with songs like I'm So Tired and Julia. And how could I forget about the gorgeous and poetic, Mother Nature's Son, Paul's vocals are raw and quiet. Now I know why the Beatles fans go nuts for George's ballad, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, the song is completely original and special. I highly recommend this album, it has great lyrics, melodies, and a weird little track called Revolution 9. Enjoy!
1847370292|5.0|I agree with most reviewers that there is nothing secretive about \\"The Secret\\", and numerous philosophers, teachers and writers have endorsed the concept for ages. Moreover, there have been many popular(self-help)books written about \\"the secret\\" or the power of positive thinking to be more precise (e.g. The Power of the Subconcious Mind and What to Say When You Talk to Yourself are two excellent ones that I have read), and if you've read just one of the better ones, everything said here will sound very much like a repetition of a well known concept. Most importantly, if you've read the New Testament, you are, as a matter of a Christian principle, already familiar with \\"the secret\\" (see for example Mark 11:23,24).    That being said, there are millions of people new to the concept, and this book will do an excellent job in potentially providing them with a new way of thinking and living, for this book is very well written and thought-out. Even if you are one of those who are familiar with the concept, you can still benefit a lot by gaining some new insights, see particular principles from a different angle and get new inspiration to actually practise \\"the secret\\".      I know for a fact that the power of positive thinking works for everybody. Some people, however, may feel uncomfortable with it from variuos reasons. I also believe that there are people who are more efficient in manifesting their thoughts than others. Some people are more efficient in connecting to the subconcious mind and utilizing its enormous power. I know this from other people's experience - my sister has been so good in manifesting her thoughts into reality, that in time she chose gradually to distance herself from the concept. It sounds crazy, but it's worth thinking about it. She told me not long time ago - \\"I just want to live my life spontaneously and find myself surprised and excited every now and then, instead of engineering every detail of my life\\". Because, be aware - the concept requires you to be very specific about what you want and even envision every single detail of it. It's not enough to be vague and want happiness or a good job or a good marriage. You have to conceive and envision things very specifically and clearly. You'll have to create your realities, simply said. Some people, like my sister, might prefer to live more sponteneously and I can understand that, because I myself, firmly believe life is beautiful, and there's so much to offer or choose from. Some people simply do not know at the moment what specifically they want, and need to decide on their own terms.     Why are some people extremely talented/efficient in turning visions and thoughts into reality and other are not is an extremely interesting question, and one that I cannot explain. It's not a matter of simply choosing to do so. I am sure there are underlying scientific principles, it certainly has a lot to do with brain frequencies and perhaps even with brain chemistry and ways of processing and communicating information and thoughts. However, anyone can experiment and find ways that work for them, for this is a universal principle that applies to everyone equally. I belive the concept can be approached from different angles. This book will not provide you with this answer, nor will it address the issue or \\"how to\\" very well - how to connect to the (call it whatever you want) \\"universe\\", \\"subconcious mind\\", \\"source\\" or whatever. That is probably because there are no proven techniques that can be prescribed literally. All we know now are a few guidelines (decide, believe, visualize...)I am also certain science will address these issues one day (hopefully soon)in an objective way, using scientific methods of investigation. Science is already breaking many barriers of classical physics. People who dissmiss the concept readily are doing so because it is not endorsed by mainstream scientific thought. But that is not a reason  to ignore it. On contrary, there is so much anecdotal evidence, that the concept warrants scientific investigation. People once believe the world was flat, and the Earth was the centre of the universe. Or, they believed flying is impossible and judged and condemned visionaries and scientific minds who dared to argue the contrary. Imagine if we all adhere to the mainstream patterns of thinking all the time. There would simply be no progress, no hope for a better world. That's why, and specifically from my own personal experience, I encourage you to embrace \\"the secret\\".
B000MV9026|3.0|Cute movie.  Good for the whole family. Robin Williams is great in it. The thing I liked about this one is that there weren't too many gags, as a lot of family films have.  Just good music, and a great story line.  Enjoy this one! :)
0471267554|3.0|Let me begin by saying that I am a 100% believer in the paleo diet/ caveman diet concept.  I am a national-level olympic weightlifter and have tried every combination of high/low carb/fat diet to find something that allowed me to stay in the same weight class as I got older.  The only thing that has ever worked is the paleo diet. <br /> <br />For a good, concise description of the paleo diet, search for it on wikipedia. <br /> <br />Having said that, I will now be critical of this book.  I found this book to be very verbose and never provided a convincing argument for the paleo diet.  Very little evidence was provided that the diet described in this book was what was eaten 20,000 years ago.  Most of the argument for this diet was modern research on how ingredient X (e.g. omega-3 fatty acids) is good for you.  I have heard excellent evidence supporting the paleo diet during a few lectures by a scientist that studies coprolites (few thousand year old petrified excrement), unfortunately, similar evidence is not in this book. <br /> <br />Furthermore, there are a few technical issues I have with what is presented in this book.  I have a PhD in theoretical chemistry.  Having gone through graduate school, I know that just about anyone can get a PhD or become faculty if they are patient.  Because of this, I'm immune to the Doctor/Professor name dropping used throughout this book. <br /> <br />Repeatedly, the author asserts that chloride from salt causes the body to become more acidic.  Offhand, it is not at all clear to me how this could happen.  Chloride ions in solution are basically inert.  I have to believe that this conjecture is wrong. <br /> <br />The author also makes repeated comments about how bad salt is for you.  A few years back, there was an article in the journal Science (one of the two highest tier scientific journals) about the politics of salt.  The article describes a political agenda to show that salt caused medical problems.  A few hundred million dollars and a half dozen project leaders later, the program was shut down because the researchers could not prove what the politicians wanted.  I'm not suggesting that people should eat a lot of salt, since cavemen ate much less sodium and more potassium than we do today, but I am suggesting the health problems blamed on salt have sketchy research backing them up. <br /> <br />In spite of this book's problems, it is worth reading.  The description of the paleo diet is good enough to be effective when followed.
B000J103PC|5.0|The Devil Wears Prada starring Meryl Streep, Anne Hathway, and Emily Blunt is deliciously sinful. Streep has never played such a feisty, fearless, and bitchy character! And by the way honey, a size 6 is not fat (thank you very much!) Hathway brings vunerability and strength to her character, Blunt is hilarious as well as she tries to dodge unwanted criticism from Miranda (Streep).  The Devil Wears Prada can be mean at times but the somwewhat sappy ending makes up for it. Great fashion, clever story, and an outstanding cast is what you'll get from this summer blockbuster. Have fun!
B000N6U0E2|4.0|I will say this, the movie is a little long.  However, Will gives one of the best performances I've seen, he definitely earned his Oscar Nom.  I found this movie to be touching and thought-provoking, and inspiring.  What better message is there?  No matter what life throws at you, no matter how bad things get, if you work hard and put yourself out there with all of your being, then things can work out for you.  I would recommend this movie for the whole family.
B0009QTS1M|5.0|This is a great movie to watch, and the extra footage helps a lot to develop more character relationships, although the action is pretty much the same (I didn't notice any difference in the action secuencies from the original release).  The extra features are a real jewel, they let you into the world of Ancient Rome and the world of the movie.  It's a great addition to any collection.  Highest possible recommendation.
B0002IRXT6|2.0|ORIGINAL April 12, 2007: The If I Ain't Got You Remix where there is a jamming session on the Piano and some bass in the backround is the only good song to come from Alicia Keys since she hit the music scene.  Seriously, what a horrible collection of music she has made.  Boring \\"artsy\\" songs that could never qualify as REAL art.  I would buy this CD just for that one remix, however, amazon didn't put track samples on this page and I don't know if that remix is on here... Even then probably I am not gonna pay the outrageous lowest price of $9 (at the time of this review) for just that 1 track.  Can anyone who knows the version I'm talking about help me find that song Plz?<br /><br />UPDATE September 6, 2013: Every etertainer has their own very unique way of expressing themselves through their music and I think it may have been a little much to downplay Alicia Keys so much, she isn't so bad, even though I don't really get into her music too much... still havn't found a way to purchase that song of hers I am looking for only an upload on youtube, we will see where that goes...
0061020710|4.0|This is not a serious book, and it never pretends to be, and quite frankly thats why i like it.  My biggest question with this series is why it took me so long to finally pick up the series.  <br /> <br />Color or Magic is Terry Pratchett's first novel in the Discworld series, and its filled with the absurd humor that makes you want to read more and more. Pratchett takes the ordinary from our world and shows just how wierd it can be, the concept of insurance for example. And the \\"main\\" characters of this novel are great: Twoflower teh tourist with his naivete, and Rincewind the wizard with his pessimism. <br /> <br />If you enjoy reading Douglas Adams or John Swartzwelder, how have you not read this series yet? This book isn't laugh out loud funny, its make your brain think funny, and in my opinion this is the best kind!
B000M5B6Q0|4.0|I bought it as a gift for my daughter she totally loves it
1582701709|1.0|I totally believe in positive thinking. I'm sad to say that this book is more about superstition and voodoo. I know that seems harsh, but the more I read, the more disappointed I felt. There's so much talk about becoming a millionaire and getting all the stuff you could ever want. :(<br /><br />Happiness isn't about stuff. Positive thinking should be about being hopeful and believing in your potential. It should be about living without the boundaries of fear and prejudice. It should be about cleansing your spirit and channeling your true energy for goodness and health. Not using your brainwaves to control the world around you. Espcially not for gluttony and convenience (at one point this book implies that you can make all your crappy coworkers get fired and move away!)<br /><br />Also, to imply that the Jews brought on the holocaust because they were worried about it is just plain ridiculous. Then again, maybe it does work and everyone is so busy wishing bad things on everyone else that we can't ever get anywhere... hmm...<br /><br />Here's the only truth you need out of this book, and it's really a quote from Einstein. Is this a friendly world or not? Choose to love everyone. See the world as a friendly place and you've instantly transported yourself to a better place.
0385474547|5.0|Chinua Achebe at his best.  <br />Things fall apart is a masterpiece. A prominent feature of bookstore shelves all over the world. It may be a bit deep for the non Nigerian but overall, this is a work of art. I don't know if I have said enough but it was truly my pleasure to have ever had the chance of ever reading such a book.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|Having seen Hedwig and the Angry Inch, I was apprehensive about this movie.  After all, Hedwig is a classic and John Cameron Mitchell had a lot to live up to.  In all honesty, He really didn't live up to the brilliance of Hedwig and the Angry Inch, in fact, you can't even compare the two films as each is an independent, unique foray. <br /> <br />Shortbus attempts (and succeeds) at focusing in on the importance of sexual identity and happiness in one's life.  In a world where people are, more often than not, taught that self-sacrifice is the key to a happy life we are confronted with several characters who, somehow, manage to mirror our own lives in a way that exposes that hippocracy.  <br /> <br />For certain the film is graphic.  It depicts sexual acts (both homo and hetero) in unabashed reality as a device to help lure the audience into believing that what they are seeing is real.  By \\"docu\\"-filming in this manner, J.M.C., is able to connect with people on a level that a well-planned and thereby censored film could never achieve. <br /> <br />While this movie certainly reflected my life and feelings regarding relationships, honesty, sex, and \\"morality\\", I suspect that anyone who has struggled with these issues who watches this movie with an open mind will benefit from it.  This is the first and ONLY film, to date, that I have ever taken the time to praise.
1582701709|1.0|What a selfish charlatan this author is and it is unbelievable that so many Americans are such big fools to believe this tripe. Never look at fat people because that allows \\"fat thoughts\\" into your mind.  Don't visit your sick friends because \\"you are inviting illness if you are listening to people talking about their illness.\\" \\"I made a decision I would not watch the news or read newspapers any more, because it did not make me feel good.\\" <br /> <br />What a load of nonsense. Ignore fat people and be a bigot, don't visit the ill and be a heartless,selfish shrew and don't stay informed and be an ignorant American who let's a dishonest administration lead our country to ruin. <br /> <br />And this gem, \\"Why do you think that 1 percent of the population earns around 96 percent of the money that's being earned?\\"  Well, hello!  Could it be massive tax cuts given to the rich, markets rigged and controlled by the 1 percent, cronyism, country club business deals? <br /> <br />I have a brilliant idea how to increase your wealth, don't buy this ridiculous book.
B000G759LW|5.0|I am usually a classic rock listener, but was attracted to the sexy jazzy sound of disc two.  I discovered that there is a song on this entire album to suit ANY mood I am in.  Her voice is so seductive and her style is a class act.  This album was worth every penny!
0780622650|1.0|I assume that at some point this project had a much better script than the final one in order to get William Hurt and others involved. I'll hold that in my mind as the only way they would get into this mess. It has action and special effects enough for 4 movies, but the plot is all over the map and never congeals into anything special.With the talent and money  that they must have had this is one poor excuse of a movie.
0307346609|4.0|Studs Terkel wrote a book based on interviews he had with people who had survived the great depression in the United States.  He interviewed people from all facets of life and socio-econonic background.  He gave a voice to the pain and triumph of a nation going through an extremely challenging time in our nations history.  This book is based on fact. <br /> <br />Max Brooks took this idea to craft a fictional account of the survivors of world wide pandemic that turns ordinary humans into zombies.  Using almost the exact same format as Mr. Terkel, Mr. Brooks summarizes pretend interviews with the survivors of his fictional plague. <br /> <br />This is a very clever idea and, as with Mr. Terkel's book, works to draw the reader into the story. <br /> <br />The only negative point is that since this is not reality, the author tends to use characters to pontificate at times so that he may express his social and political views.  Some of these views I agree with, some I found quite interesting and some I thought pretentious. <br /> <br />All in all, this was a great read and I would recommend it highly.  If you want something based on reality, I would also highly recommend Hard Times.
6305678715|4.0|I like what M. Hartmann said> I to just like some movies and don't tear at them much. This is not the best movie ever made but I was involved and enjoyed the plot about past sins, mistakes, and learning from others. After a murder on the Presidio base leads to a chase into S.F. city limits Connery and Harmon(who dislike each other must work together to find the truth. Like I said, nothing special but I was entertained and that's what a movie is supposed to do. enjoy
1400031524|3.0|I found this book lacking in excitement and credibility.  I liked the character of Wallender but found the other characters not very well developed. And the plot was weak.  For instance, I can't understand why the detective was so driven to return to Riga and risk his life, if not his comfort, to get involved in something that did not seem compelling.  I felt the novel got off to a good start, but then lapsed into incredulity.  This was my first, and will probably be my last, Wallendar novel.  I just found the characters and the plot weak and unexciting.
B00009RDGA|5.0|This is the kind of movie that can not be duplicated. It is like lightning in a bottle. Ryan and Tatum O'Neal are pure magic as the \\"one step ahead of em\\" con artists, but it is little Tatum O'Neal who completely steals the show! Filmed in beautiful black and white which sets the tone of this depression era comedy. The supporting cast in excellent too, so the film never drags. The DVD transfer is great and some interesting extras.
B00005JPCF|2.0|The voices are difficult to understand, most of the dialogues are meaningless to the young audience.  Adult penguins are creepy (young ones are cute, though).  Penguin eyes look like they are made of glass.  Overall a very disappointing experience watching this movie.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|A great deluxe treament to an equally great film. Julie Andrews in her first film is just spellbinding as \\"Mary Poppins\\". The DVD has a great transfer and a load of interesting extras. One of Disneys finest moments.
6305291446|4.0|I liked it!  While nothing can top John Carpenter's original Halloween -- sequels and remakes almost always fall short of our expectations -- H20 is suspensful and good, and the musical score includes a variation of John Carpenter's classic, errie theme as a reminder.  Jamie Lee Curtis brings class and authenticity to the film, which is almost as scary as the original Halloween. The film's vibe succeeds without too much gratutious sex and gore, and keeps you on the edge until the end. I agree with the other reviewers who didn't like the other cheap sequels after Halloween II ... they just didn't have the same vibe as the first two films with Jamie Lee. This one is a worthy addition to anyone's Halloween collection.
B00005RRG9|4.0|This has always been one of my favorite Disney live action films. Haley Mills does a good job with her double duty and O'Hara and Keith are excellent as always. The Vault Collection version is a worthy puchase, sure they could have cleaned up the print more,but it looks pretty good and there are lots of extras. Disney has been guilty of not doing there films justice anyway. Other than a few of the animated gems, they have release sub par fullscreen and dirty prints for years.
B000GTLQXU|3.0|The most predictable of last year's box-office bombs, Poseidon was always on a hiding to nothing: a remake of the much-loved but frankly not that good blockbuster that kickstarted the 70s disaster movie trend, arriving a year after a reviled TV miniseries version, showing all the signs of burning cash as it was rushed through production to meet a summer release date (it looks like it cost $80m but cost nearer twice as much despite the less than stellar cast) and coming in at a very slim 98-minutes (twelve of them credits) was always going to be facing too many negative waves. Perhaps someone at Warners should have remembered what happened the last time they boarded the Poseidon with Irwin Allen's disastrous sequel to the original, Beyond the Poseidon Adventure, which sank with all hands. Naturally, this isn't anywhere near as bad.    Always having been disappointed with the 1972 version, I must admit I didn't find this nearly as bad as others did and probably enjoyed it more despite its many obvious failings. To be fair the much-criticized lack of characterization isn't a major issue here since the wave hits at roughly the same point in the running time as the original, which relied on the audience identifying with recognisable stars in clichéd roles rather than quality writing, although it's a film that's in too much of a hurry to work as well as it could. The pacing definitely is a problem, with some scenes not allowed long enough to establish any real tension before amping up: it's definitely a film in a hurry, whether due to re-editing (not particularly readily apparent, to be fair) or a desire to give the film a sense of urgency. It's not one of Petersen's better jobs of direction - better than The Perfect Storm or Air Force One, not as good as Troy or Das Boot - and the CGI is variable - many of the most criticized shots are pretty decent, while it's often the explosions that convince the least - but it throws in a couple of surprises (including one surprisingly brutal moment in an elevator shaft), has a much better than expected supporting turn from Richard Dreyfuss who steals what few acting honors are going and is much more enjoyable than I was expecting.    For a two-disc set, the extras are pretty light - aside from the 22-minute featurette and trailer on disc one, the extras on the second disc barely clock over an hour, with the half-hour documentary on Rogue Waves the clear winner.
B00005K3NR|5.0|This is such a strange movie as you wouldn't know it was a horror film until very late in the movie. When it gets there it will scare the you know what out of you! Most have seen this film,but for those of you who haven't, I don't want to tell too much. Truly a classic and one of Kings stories get a grade A movie treatment. Spacek should get a lot of credit as it is her at the prom in a trance like state that takes this movie to another level, she is magnificent. The DVD has a great transfer with some excellent bonus features.
B000A6T1KE|3.0|Star Trek: Nemesis killed off the movie series, and on a second viewing it's not hard to see why. While it's not quite as bad as its detractors claim, it suffers from a terrible screenplay by John Logan that never manages to integrate characterization into the action, leaving most of it to be found in the DVD's deleted scenes bin, while slogging through an incredibly undernourished but tediously dragged out and dull story that has one good but barely utilized idea in having as its villain a younger clone of the Enterprise's captain. How did they manage it? They must have got a hair off the bald captain's comb is the main theory offered (this may be a joke, but judging from how crude the comedy is elsewhere that's doubtful). Why did they do it? Part of an elaborate conspiracy they, er, gave up on years ago. But he's got a plan to make the Romulan Empire great again, of course. Probably. Quite what his nefarious plot to destroy the Federation is is never really explained so there's not much in the way of threat - especially since the villain only has one spaceship and quickly loses his allies because he keeps wasting time playing mind games or committing the odd psychic rape rather than getting down to delivering the conquest and pillage he promised. Oh, and he needs Captain Picard's DNA to stop himself prematurely self-destructing. Only, on second thoughts, he decides not to bother and to do something else instead. Quite what isn't exactly clear, but it involves filling much of the last third of the movie with a desperately unexciting space battle against a dull green background before yet another of the regular TV cast makes the ultimate sacrifice. Unfortunately this time round there is absolutely no reason for him to do so, and this being Star Trek where no popular character is allowed to stay dead (it even took two death scenes to kill off Captain Kirk in Generations) the ending is yet another copout. Koboyashi Maru indeed...  <br /> <br />A clumsy and half-hearted rehash of The Wrath of Khan and The Undiscovered Country, this voyage is clearly one for the money, with the regulars topping up their pension funds big time and the guest stars getting screwed. Even Ron Perlman makes no impression whatsoever in what looks like a cheap Halloween Skeletor mask (easily the worst makeup job in Star Trek history, and that includes the green chick and the plastic lizard guy in the 60s TV show). Still, you can have a few cheap laughs at the expense of the distinctly unthreatening Tom Hardy and the gleeful sadism of casting someone who can't pronounce his `r's as a Reman who has usurped control of the Romulan Empire, leading to lines like \\"Womulans feel thweatened by Wemen upstawts\\" or \\"We will no longer bow befawr anyone as slaves. Not the Womulans and not your mighty Fedewation. We are a wace bwed for waw... and conqwest\\" - at times it's like listening to Biggus Dickus addressing the crowd in Monty Python's Life of Brian. The usually reliable Stuart Baird, wearing his directing hat, can do nothing to liven things up, and even the great Jerry Goldsmith's score is distinctly professional but workmanlike. Incredibly dull stuff.  <br /> <br />The extras package on the 2-disc set at least is impressive, carrying over all the extras from the one-disc release and adding to them comprehensively with additional added scenes and more featurettes than you could possibly want - even the Easter egg featurettes are a decent length for once. If only they graced a better film...
0618680004|5.0|Realistically, one cannot prove nor disprove the past or present existence of a 'god' (superior being, force, entity, etc.), whatever form this 'god' would have taken.  The fact is though, that MORTAL MEN wrote ALL religious books, tomes, and manuscripts throughout all of history, not some 'pie-in-the-sky' 'god'!  So, as for a clearcut, definitive answer to that grand cosmological and philosophical question as to whether 'god' exists or not, one must be a realist and humble themselves, and take the stance that we just don't know.  One thing IS for certain though- mainly that ethics and morality CAN and DO exist and stand on their own independent of religion.  Ethics and morality are NOT predicated solely on one's belief or acceptance of religion or a 'god'.  End of story.    P.S. You MUST watch this hilarious George Carlin video on 'religion'! Enjoy!

0385334206|5.0|I learned tonight of Kurt Vonnegut's passing, at age 84.  I immediately thought of this book, Breakfast of Champions, as the quintessential Vonnegut novel -- not just for what is on the page, but moreso for what it meant to me, especially when I read it for the first time so many years ago. <br /> <br />It was 1979, just six years after he wrote Breakfast, and I was 15, a callow and precocious and dependable and rebellious lad, all at once in those crazy mid-adolescent years.  And no one's words spoke quite as eloquently or directly to my fevered brain as did this aging, iconoclastic, sublimely inventive and imaginative author.  He was only two years older than my father, and yet light years different in terms of his world view and humor.  And to me, this out-of-left-field novel, about banal, blase and boring car salesman Dwayne Hooper and his sudden awakening and transformation into someone so much more complex, is brilliant absudist humor. <br /> <br />I think even the oft-derided cartoon drawings Vonnegut peppers his writings with -- and he uses them liberally throughout Breakfast -- work to perfection here.  Vonnegut's drawings deftly set the tone and constantly remind the reader that this is not the overstuffed, pretentious stuff of Mailer or Vidal or any of Vonnegut's other contemporaries.   <br /> <br />Re-reading Breakfast a few years ago, I couldn't help but think that an adolescent of today might consider the style almost quaint, considering how much snark and absurdist humor has permeated popular culture over the last 20 or 30 years.  To some, I guess the discerning minority, it would be as powerful today as it was more than 30 years ago.  There is humor that makes you laugh, and then there are works that also make you think and help expand your horizons to boot.  To me, Breakfast of Champions is that kind of brilliance. <br /> <br />I found it deliciously ironic that it was my father's copy of Breakfast that I had swiped all those many years ago, a copyhe never opened as far as I know, but a copy that still sits in my library to this day. I loved my father then as I do now, but at age 15 was discovering (as all boys do) that he was not the perfect hero I imagined when I was 6 or 7. Reading Vonnegut's brilliant, out-there work helped put in stark relief that there were so many different ideas and experiences and universes than the suburbia in which I'd grown up.  And that was fine by me.  Farewell, Kurt, and thanks for sharing your brilliance; I for one will miss it.
B000N6U0DS|5.0|This is a heart warming movie with excellent acting and a wonderful (true) story. Will Smith and son were so adorable together (Jaden looks like his Mom:)). A fair warning for those with kids though - it has the F word near the beginning but other than that a clean movie- so maybe watch it first and then fast forward through it if you plan on watching it on family night.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|Alfonso Cuaron (robbed of a best director Oscar-- heck, he didn't even get a nomination!) took the skeleton of a premise from author PD James' dystopian novel of the same name and made a beautiful commentary on modern immigration, capitalism, and globalization set in the year 2027 where all women have become infertile. Cuaron doesn't really offer any answers to these problems, he just holds up a mirror and says: look what's happening in the world TODAY! If any answers are attempted at all it is with the film's simple and understated ending--there is always hope.      As for features: I usually avoid one-disc DVDs knowing that a 2-disc \\"special edition\\" is likely in the future, but rest assured this film's single disc is packed to the gills. The stunning documentary, Possibility of Hope, in which modern philosphers discuss globalization and immigration is truly eye-opening as well. Normally I whine when there's no director's commentary, but the featurettes and documentary say all I think director Cuaron needed to add to this truly remarkable film.
0374105235|5.0|I just finished reading A Long Way Gone by Ishmael Beah.  This book tells the authors story of becoming a boy soldier in Sierra Leone and of his later rehabilitation.  This was a heartbreaking story and very difficult to read from an emotional standpoint.  I read the book over a short period of time as it is so gripping that I did not want to put it down, but at the same time it brought an overwhelming sense of sorrow that I felt like weeping the whole time.  The horror that Beah so well describes, was unbelievably moving. <br /> <br />The book is well written and flows superbly.  However, the story itself is so incredible that, even if it were poorly constructed, it would have been worth reading.  Saying that it was \\"worth reading\\" is not really adequate.  All people should read it in order to remind us what the reality of life is outside of Western culture. It is partly because we block incidents like those described by Beah that they can continue to happen. <br /> <br />I would not presume to know how to stop the carnage that occurs in so many Third World countries, but I can not help but think that if we as a society, were more aware of them and had to face the emotions and gut wrenching sorrow that come with the knowledge of such atrocities, we would be far less willing to allow them to happen.  <br /> <br />Ishmael Beah has demonstrated that he is a remarkable individual with great reserves.  He shows what changes can come about when people are caring and thoughtful of others.  I would venture to say that Ishmael Beah feels guilt for what he has done.  However, I think he should be proud of the fact that he has endured and triumph over so much evil and pain in becoming who he is today. <br /> <br />It was an honor to be allowed to hear Beah's story, as it must have been as equally difficult to recount it, as it was to live through it.  Beah's courage in just letting others know of his past in remarkable also.
B000K7VHQ4|2.0|What ever happened to Edward Norton? He used to make great and daring films like Fight Club, Primal Fear, and American History X. I think he tried to get back to great and daring films with THE ILLUSIONIST, but unfortunately the director failed him. The films winter 2006 theatrical release was brief and thus I never got a chance to see the film in theaters and eagerly bought it when it came out on DVD. And the reviews were right, it was a great film--until the third act.<br /><br />Those who said The Prestige (which I loved) dragged on probably won't like THE ILLUSIONIST much better. The first 2/3 of the film move along at an interesting and quick pace, but the entire third act of the film drags and meanders to an obvious and rather weak payoff. And this is coming form a guy who loves twist endings. I never saw the Sixth Sense's ending coming for a moment, but the wonderful \\"twist ending\\" people rave about is completely obvious at worst and utterly lame at best. The films horrible third act pacing and execution coupled with Norton and Jessica Biel's utter lack of onscreen chemistry bring this film down to 2 stars for me.
B000MV9026|2.0|I normally like the animated movies that are coming out but this one just could not keep me awake. The music was fun yes but I could barely understand what they were saying when they were talking. Kids would probably be better off just having the soundtrack then sitting thru this snoozefest.
B000MXPE7O|3.0|Writer Eric Roth said he originally wrote this film for Francis Ford Copolla about 12 years ago, and the Godfather comparisons weren't lost on a lot of critics either. However, I don't feel as if we ever really get into the mind of the main character played by Matt Damon. One could argue that's the very essence of his character--he's so guarded that he is truly unknowable--but who wants to watch a 3hr movie about a guy like that? That being said, this semi-ficionalization of the Cold War CIA does have its interesting moments and sparked my interest in finding out more about this era in American history. <br /> <br />
B000JBWWRY|5.0|My niece watched this for the first time with my husband and myself and she loved it as did we.
B00005S6K8|4.0|The basic story is that the Chauffeurs daughter Sabrina falls in love with playboy David Larrabee. She tries to kills herself and is sent to Paris. When she returns as a mature woman David suddenly takes an interest in her. This would be great but David is engaged to another woman and this other woman brings with her a very sweet business opportunity for the Larrabee Industries run by elder brother Linus. Linus not a man to let a business opportunity pass him by because of his brother's female distractions sets out to distract the object of David's recent affections. Of course things start to go wrong when Linus develops feelings for Sabrina... <br /> <br />While I prefer the original I still think this version is a great movie. My main problem with it is that the younger brother isn't really good looking enough. I can see him being a playboy but honestly if I can't imagine anyone in their right mind choosing that Greg Kinnear over Harrison Ford. Did you see that guy when he was younger? Indiana Jones? Han Solo? Also when you watch this movie again it feels more dated than the original. That having been said this is a great feel good movie.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Loved this CD! so refreshing to hear a younger singer bringing back and/or reinventing these classic tunes.  The brass on \\"Save The Last Dance For Me\\" is fantastic.
B000F39M9W|4.0|Like some other reviewers, I was expecting to fall in love with Salonen's work (given how strong a performance he recently recorded of three major works by Hindemith, and the care he took with those, albeit recorded in a different concert hall with the LA Philharmonic).  This version of Le Sacre does have its moments, but I find Gergiev's performance more compelling (notwithstanding the sometimes recessed sound of the eight French horns), and surely more dramatic. Sonically, there's enough bass drum content in this recording to probably inspire some low rider to tool around town in a lowered Chevy playing this CD loud enough to crack his own ribs, a result that's highly desirable in his value system.  But the bass drum is more dramatic and even harrowing in Gergiev's recording, which is somewhat inexplicable yet nonetheless true. In any event, the hype over this recording is somewhat overstated: it is hardly revolutionary. <br /> <br />I also regret to report that Salonen's performance of the original version of Mussorgsky's \\"Night on Bald Mountain\\" does not compare to the premiere recording by Claudio Abbado, which still comes across as definitive interpretationally, in regard to balance, and with respect to sonic clarity.  This is something of a surprise, given how little competition Salonen has to deal with in bringing this work to the public's attention. My complaint throughout most of my listening was \\"where are the details? everything sounds muddy compared to Abbado!\\"  Maybe the engineers are still figuring out how to get clarity recording in this new hall -- they certainly haven't achieved it as yet. <br /> <br />The Bartok work is well-recorded, and although I own several other versions, this might end up being my go-to interpretation for the work: it is at least tied with the other top contenders (Abbado's on DG, and the Complete Bartok Edition version as well).
B00000099Y|5.0|It might be... Just buy the damn thing if you don't own it.  It is incredible from start to finish.  You might not get it right away, you might never get it... if that is the case, you are missing out and I feel sorry for you.  You will be hard pressed to find a rock album as good as this one.  It experiments but at the same time you can just groove to it... It walks a line between unlistenable noise and brutal metal and does it well.  Better than just about 99.9% of rock albums out there.
B000286RKW|5.0|GoodFellas is one of my 6 favorite movies. Whats not to like? There's violence, heist, lil bit of humor, and raw emotion. The thing that sets this mob movie apart from the rest is the fact that it's realistic. Movies like Scarface and The Godfather are romanticized or they seem like fantasies. Everybody in this film did a phenomenal job. Also, I'd like to mention that Martin Scorsese and Robert DeNiro are my favorite.  I would also like to add that the DVD extras were pretty cool.
B000JJS8TM|4.0|It seems as if the Grey Album may have been the inspiration for this- but what the heck! What makes this album nice is that with a little creative editing, you can have a preview of what the remastered versions of a few songs will sound like, most notably \\"Revolution\\" and \\"Yesterday.\\"<br /><br />My favorite mash-ups are \\"Tomorrow Never Knows/Within You Without You\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\" (with its inventive use of \\"Goodnight\\" and Yellow Submarine\\" snippets).<br /><br />It also makes sense to get the CD plus the Audio DVD if you're ever going to have a surround sound system. It didn't get five stars because it should have been more out there than it was, dig?
B000HCO8IQ|3.0|Scissor Sisters' self-titled debut album established them as the kind of band that really belongs in their own genre, complete with songs that although good, would really get little attention outside of dance clubs. Be that as it may, the quintet continues their exuberance with Ta-Dah.<br /><br />While I wouldn't rate this as high as most of the recent reviewers rated it, it's still a solid album. The first three tracks run into each other though; not that they're bad (well, \\"She's My Man\\" is as bizarre as its title), but they really don't sound that much different from each other. Because of this, I was wondering if the album would sound like one long single, but fortunately, things get more varied throughout the rest of the album.<br /><br />One surprising thing is that unlike on their first album, there are a few mellow tracks to be found on here, like \\"Intermission\\" and \\"Land of a Thousand Words\\". But the songs are still good, as are \\"Lights\\" and \\"Everybody Wants the Same Thing\\". And while \\"Paul McCartney\\" isn't a bad song, I don't quite understand where the title comes from (one reviewer suggested that the song is a fan letter to Sir Paul, but I'm not so sure).<br /><br />While you might find a strange lyric here and there, Ta-Dah is still a good album from Scissor Sisters. It's not QUITE as good as their self-titled album, but if you didn't mind dancing to that album, you should have no problem doing the same to this one.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert

B000IVW25M|5.0|Snow White and the 7 Dwarfs is simply enchanting. We got the DVD a few months back, but just saw it with a group of children that were visiting and chose this to be the entertainment of the night. The quality is superb, the sound magnificent. Soon we found ourselves immersed in the story of a queen who is vain and wicked, trying hard to forever be the fairest in the land. <br /> <br />Snow White grows to be a very beautiful princess and soon, the enchanted mirror tells the Queen that she is no longer the most beautiful, the title now goes to Snow White. <br /> <br />Jealousy and envy drive the queen to attempt to eliminate the fair princess. Snow White meets the seven dwarfs, who live in the forest, and we find ourselves singing right along with them... \\"Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho, It's home from work we go, Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho.\\" <br /> <br />The creatures of the forest are marvelous as they help Snow White with daily chores. Some of the most endearing moments in movie history. In the end, love saves the day... and Snow White has her dream come true. Unforgettable song: \\"some day my prince will come, some day we'll meet again, and away to his castle we'll go, to be happy forever I know.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Some day when spring is here, we'll find our love anew, and the birds will sing, and wedding bells will ring, some day when my dreams come true!\\" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000NA28IE|5.0|This is easily one of the best book to film adaptions I have ever seen. Newcomer Ed Speelers takes the role of the main character Eragon, while Jeremy Irons, Sienna Guillory,John Malkovich, and Robert Carlyle shine as the supporting cast. If you thought Harry Potter was good then Eragon will leave you speechless.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|Angus MacGyver, played by Richard Dean Anderson is a wonderful series. The episodes share the adventures of a man, rather knowledgeable and capable of confronting any situation, any danger, any adversary without fear because he seems to intuitively know what to do to escape or survive challenges. <br /> <br />From preventing major catastrophic events with the help of a simple paper clip, a roll of dock-tape, and a pocket knife, the hero allows us to safely travel with him to all corners of the world. He is James Bond without the help of high tech gadgets! <br /> <br />What we like most is the simple things that MacGyver turns into wonderful tools or weapons, and the explanations that permit us to learn and enjoy his fascinating expertise. <br /> <br />The first season has 22 episodes and each one is excellent. MacGyver works for the Phoenix Foundation, he is a spy, and always does good wherever he goes, getting involved with others and attempting to do what is right. <br /> <br />A treasure to own, especially if you have teenagers around in need of an education on survival skills. If ever in trouble, I wish MacGyver would come to the rescue! <br />
1594481938|5.0|I fell for this novel, excuse the pun. Hornby has a way of being comic and tragic at the same time. His characters come alive on the page, and the story is so engrossing, it's hard to put the book down for longer than ten minutes at a time. If you like comic writing, this is a must read. I won't go into plot detail here, because the other reviewers have done that adequately. Highly recommend!

0143038095|2.0|The author Amy Tan is an Asian female 'Uncle Tom' (look up the term) for her garbage called the 'Joy Luck Club'. It portrays all Asian men in a made-up, negative light, while causing her Asian female protagonists to marry White men, who even cheat on them in the movie, but that doesn't stop the Asian girls from staying with them.    Amy Tan is a self hating Asian female. She is like some Asian girls who grew up hating the fact that she looked so different from her classmates/peers, and fit in however way she could by acting White, and wanting only White men. Personally, she has been massively depressed most of her life (look it up), and has had a terrible marriage with a Caucasian. In her books, she tries to justify her life decisions by portraying White men as White knights, and Asian men as controlling and oppressive, when that couldn't be farther from the truth.    Amy Tan set Asian men and women back decades in this country. How come in Hollywood flicks we see mostly see Black-Black couples, or Latin-Latin couples, but the Asian women are always with a White guy? It seems like every TV show and movie in the past ten years pairs an Asian girl with a White guy romatically. Asian men are being completely suppressed in television and film. Amy Tan helped glamorize the exclusive Asian female/White male pairing that is everywhere on TV, movies, and commercials these days, at the complete suppression of Asian men.    These shows affect kids. Teens, especially girls, judge themselves on others' opinions, and are easily influenced. Young, insecure Asian girls are conditioned through social norms/media to 'act White' and want only White men, and young Asian American boys growing up in the US are conditioned to think they are unattractive.    Have you ever met any Asian families!? The Asian men are predominantly kind, quiet, giving, loving husbands, and providing fathers, and their WIVES make almost all the decisions (at least in Chinese culture). They direct the husband and kids, so to speak. I'm tired of hearing false oppression crap about Asian men from White people, and brain-washed Asian girls, just to make us unattractive in their minds. Also, here's a FACT, not a generalization - as a group, Asian men have the highest average education and income, combined with the lowest avg rates of murder, theft, infidelity, spousal abuse, rape, child molestation, divorce, and crime in this country.
0743298020|4.0|This is not your usual novel, at least not compared to other novels I usually read. It is clear that the author has a love for the \\"classic\\" novels which I haven't read (yes, yes...I've never felt the need to read any of them...perhaps in the future?).<br /><br />Anyway, I thought the story was interesting and it kept my interest for the most part. Sometimes, though, I did get annoyed with the main character (Margaret) and her \\"twin\\" rants. It seemed like anytime that Vida Winter wasn't telling her story, Margaret went on a \\"oh poor me...I see a reflection of myself and it's my sister's ghost trying to reach me!\\" rant. Margaret, sometimes a reflection in the mirror is just that...a reflection!<br /><br />Thankfully, most of the book is about Miss Winter's story, which I actually enjoyed reading.<br /><br />Overall, this was a pretty entertaining read. I'm looking forward to this author's next work.<br /><br />-Ater

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This is so far the best adaptation of the novel I have ever seen. The story is of course so powerful that one cannot help but reading the book all over again after watching this version. It is easy to see why people love this book, the characters are very intense and real. While some may say that Toby Stephens is too handsome for the part, he makes up for it by making the character utterly real. In the book, the character is lovable, but has to be \\"humanized\\" a little to hold when put on screen, and Toby is a master at this. He is an utterly chamaleonic actor, you can see in the different stages of the story. Ruth Wilson is the perfect Jane Eyre, she makes you see the tenderness as well as the self determination of the character, which in my opinion, is quite difficult. There are things in the book that have to be ommitted in the film for logical reasons, for the book is a first person account, and the film is not. However, Ruth Wilson is so expressive that you do not feel the film is lacking in information. They are a truly awesome pair, I honestly feel that miss Brontë would have been very satisfied with this version. It is very close to the spirit of the book, one of the best examples of Victorian literature, revolutionary and passionate. This is the story of two very real characters, flawed in many ways, who fall in love because they are \\"suited\\" to each other. In a way it is a triumph of the modern Victorian woman, who manages to tame a wild beast of a man, who in spite of being deceitful and selfish, proves to have a true heart. The intenseness of the story as well as its plausibility is what makes it eternal.
0894803123|5.0|I have had and used this book for about 8 years now.  I actually bought it from a Ben & Jerry's store when I lived in Vermont.<br /><br />I have made some great ice cream since then and used just about every recipe in the book.  In addition to ice cream recipes, they also include recipes for sorbet and other non-dairy desserts, as well as recipes for brownies and other \\"add-ins\\" for your ice cream.  And the recipes are GOOD!<br /><br />Just a couple notes to those of you who are expecting to not have to buy B&J again once you get this book.  There's a lot more to making ice cream than just the ingredients, which are very simple - I can tell you right now it's cream, milk, sugar and if you want, eggs.  That's it -- that's a \\"base\\" for whatever you want to add, like vanilla, chocolate, M&Ms, cookie dough, whatever.  But B&J has really perfected the art of *making* the ice cream - putting in the proper amount of air, freezing it in the proper amount of time to reduce the ice crystal size, etc.  I have found it very difficult to do this at home with normal ice cream making equipment.  I used to have a regular ice/salt freezer that turns as you add ice and salt around the bucket to make it cold.  Now I have one of those bowls for my Kitchenaid stand mixer that you pre-freeze in the freezer.  It works fine - but here's a tip:  After you make your ice cream mix, put it in the freezer for about 1/2 hour to make it as cold as possible (without turning to ice) before you put it in your maker.  The faster the ice cream freezes, the creamier it is.  Another thing, if you want more \\"volume\\" (less dense) ice cream, whip some air into it before you put it in the maker.  Some commercial ice creams have as much as 50% air!  Gee, no wonder when it melts there's only 1/2 of what I thought I had!  ;-)<br /><br />Just one issue I have had with the book is that it does not include a recipe for a custard base, which is basically the milk/egg/sugar mixture cooked until it's thickened, then cooled and churned in the maker.  Maybe they don't sell this \\"frozen custard\\" and that's why they didn't include it -- but I really like the texture of this type of ice cream better.d, then cooled and churned in the maker.

B000GFLKF8|4.0|\\"Inside Man\\" appears to be about a robbery at a large Manhattan bank, but there's much more to it than what meets the eye. Denzel Washington plays NYPD Detective Keith Frazier, who attempts to outsmart the mastermind of the bank robbery (Clive Owen). However, what appears to be an \\"ordinary\\" robbery/hostage situation turns out to be a personal vendetta to expose evil secrets from long ago. Throw Jodie Foster into the mix as a mysterious problem solver of sorts, and you end up with a very entertaining movie.<br /><br />There are quite a few holes in the plot, but \\"Inside Man\\" is definitely a lot of fun to watch, although I doubt I'll ever sit down and watch it again. It's much more refreshing than the so-called \\"thrillers\\" Hollywood has been cranking out recently, so that in itself is a relief. This is an entertaining film with a lot of great one-liners and an excellent cast. Check it out now while it's playing on Comcast On Demand!

B000F5GO0A|4.0|I love Balcanian music, and I also appreciate this album so much because it is a creation of a very young person.
B000001DV2|4.0|Seems like everyone either loves or hates this album.  Is it \\"Hysteria Part II\\", as some say?  Maybe, I would reply, but is that a bad thing?  Adrenalize is a solid rock release amidst a sea of the new grunge emerging at the time, so I'd say it lived up to its promise although admittedly it's not on par with Hysteria.  I don't know that that's a realistic expectation.  The death of guitarist Steve Clark had a significant impact on their sound as well as on the emotions and well-being of the band, I'm sure. It couldn't have been an easy time, yet they still put a great album out.
B0000009RT|5.0|This is just one of those classics that you could never get enough of, no matter how many spins it gets. A bizzarre and delightfully off-kilter assault on the ears.<br /><br />'Freak Out' is one of the more unconventional albums of its time. It has that unmistakingly late 60's acid trip vibe to it that really adds a nice touch to the Zappa insanity. 'Freak Out' is full of unconventional, off-kilter, mock-pop songs that really indulge in Zappa's bizzare sense of humor, such as 'Go Cry on Somebody Else's Shoulder', but then it also has its 'moments of clarity' as well. This album really reminds me of Pink Floyd's 'Saucerful of Secrets' except with more humor and less LSD. Even though the music is aimed in different directions, the production and mix are really similar in my opinion. Everything on this album is completely, delightfully, off the wall.<br /><br />From the almost instrumental arrangments of vocalizations that would later be the foundation of Mike Patton's Mr. Bungle, to the extremely long sound samples twords the end, everything fits together perfectly in its own, strange, Zappatastic way. The sound samples are really a key part to this album rather than simple filler. Zappa prove to be absolutely and completely original by preforming magnificant pieces of avant-garde art with seemingly mindless noise.<br /><br />'Freak Out' is truly a gem of the late sixties, and an absolute must have for anyone who considers himself the slightest Zappa fan. Scratch that, for anyone who considers himself a fan of avant-garde music itself, this album is totally classic.
B00000IYWH|5.0|A snapshot of an Elvis refining a mature and polished sound. Accompanied by musicians such as Floyd Crammer, Scotty Moore, D.J.Fontana,Homer \\"Boots\\" Garland and others, this studio session is made comprehensive by the inclusion of six extra tracks that were originally used as \\"B\\" sides to singles and left off the original L.P..  <br /> <br />My favourite extra is \\"I Gotta Know\\" which was the \\"B\\" side to \\"Are you lonesome tonight\\", a seldom heard gem of a track. \\"Mess of Blues\\" is another which backed \\"It's Now or Never\\" and never really featured else where. The stereo quality is dynamic, and here all together they make an accurate timestamp, a time capsule as it were of post G.I. Elvis in 1960. <br />This album is hard to find in this 18 track format, and I would suggest you get it when you can.
B00062RCBW|5.0|When I was young, the Star Trek, Next Generation episdes were on TV.  I recorded them each week for my father who was out of town, due to work.  I grew up with Star Trek as my model of proper behavior, and it provided a bridge that I was able to use to communicate with adults even though I was just a teenager.  I bought the DVD set to be able to share that experience with my children.  They love Star Trek as much as I do, and for the same reasons.  It is wonderful to have every episode on DVD, as the tapes I made didn't last as long as the 20 years my memory has.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|This concert is the reason why I fell in love with Neil Young in the first place. Vulnerable, simple, poetic, melodic. Beautiful across the board. There is no one like him.
B000002UA5|4.0|I bought this album right after it was released after hearing a cut on a newly emerged progressive rock station.  I believe it was the song Astronomy Domine.  I knew nothing of what had come before from Pink Floyd nor obviously what was to come.  I found the album to stand alone in creativity, style, approach, concept, musicianship, daring, and eccentricity.  It worked and worked well for such a groundbreaking double album.  Had Pink Floyd not gone on to greater, more accessible work, I do believe that this album would always be a favorite of mine for all times as it was for me on first impression.  It is not perfect but the material shows the  potential of a fledgling rock group having to restart after retooling for life without Syd.  David Gilmour is not Barrett and that is good, both as in showing all of us a definite demarcating style line in tribute to the all too short lived performances of Syd Barrett but also to show all of us what Pink Floyd now was and how appealing they could be with the urgency to have to take off in a new direction out of necessity.  This LP (now CD) is an old friend.   Haka pah cow... hi yee!
0515141429|2.0|The book's scam was really good. The problem was that you'll have to trawl it away from more than 400 pages.<br /><br />The way Jack found Hubble was overly far-fetched. I mean the way he explained to him why he thought he was in that specific city, in that specific hotel with that specific name.<br /><br />The love story was pathetic. A female officer just smitten with the supposedly killer.<br /><br />The 20 years' veteran cop that does not know what to do with a phone number just because is a cell.<br /><br />And I can keep writing on and on.
B0002KQNJU|1.0|There's a reason Polanski is not known as a comedy director.  I dont know.  Maybe this was funny by 60s standards?  Laugh-in?  This film certainly wasnt scarey.  And the cut erotic scenes are G-rated by 2007 standards.
B000I2J6K0|4.0|camera angles are a little funky but otherwise a good workout <br /> <br />she gives a really nice warm up then rhythmic movement then floor work and then a (almost too brief) stretch/relaxation at the end.  that being said she does not come off as perky or artificial or annoying and the exercises are challenging without being too hard
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Exceptional,  One of the best concerts I have seen.  Exciting performers, & great musicians.
B0000509C4|1.0|Not once has anyone ever seen such a collection of low-budget wierdness. You can't blame the actors; they are pretty good. Blame the lame storylines, lousy music, and stupid props.  <br />Just trust me. Not scary, not thrilling, not worth the time. The only thing great here was the cute topless girl, to be honest.
0060752610|5.0|During the last five years I entered the stock market and took a couple of seminars on investing in stocks, the seminars were valuable introductions to the market, after reading the book I discovered that what I had learned in those seminars was to behave like an speculator rather than a true investor. After many costly mistakes I know why I needed to read the book. The cases presented in the book of companies that in many cases no longer exist do not harm the wisdom and clarity of the basics needed to become a true investor. I recommend the book to every person who wants to enter the market. It is actually a must read beforehand. Now I know what Warren Buffet means when stating \\"this is the best book on investing ever written\\". Hope you will find it as valuable.<br /><br />Carlos Irving Rojas - Mexico City
032147404X|5.0|This is simply the greatest \\"how to\\" book on photography ever written. Scott Kelby knows his stuff first of all. Second, he lets you in the club. Many of these techniques took me years to figure out on my own, and others I had to reluctantly pry out of other \\"master\\" photographers. Still others I just learned reading this amazing book. Scott Kelby tells you like he is your best friend. I have multiple copies of only 2 books in my home. The Holy Bible and The Digital Photography Book by Scoot Kelby.
B000M5AJQS|3.0|I gave this movie 3 stars merely for the acting, which was handled effortlessly.  The problems here though exist on many levels: <br /> <br />(SPOILERS AHEAD) <br />1. How many cell phone calls does it take until someone notices they are being made?  Probably much less than depicted here. <br /> <br />2. Why does everyone have to die?  Very ridiculous, there were many other ways to finish this movie that would have satisfied many more people.  Too many \\"Pay It Forward\\" endings in a lifetime can really make a person bitter, you know? <br /> <br />3. Very hard to follow.  Heck, I didn't know they were moles until I read the back of the DVD case halfway through the movie, then I had to explain it to my wife, and we are people who understood Memento the first time through. <br /> <br />Should not have won all the awards it got. <br />DUD!
B000777J2S|5.0|You can't listen to this and not feel something.  Whether it's confusion, annoyance, or awe you are feeling - it's anything but your run of the mill music.   <br />I can't stop listening to Fistful of Love.  It gives me chills and makes me want to cry every time I hear it.  It's not often you come by music that powerful.
B000MGUZM0|3.0|3.5 stars actually, but I gave this 3 stars vs 4 (for some balance- too many gushing 5 star reviews here).    This is a decent follow-up to Funeral.  I loved Funeral the first time I heard it, but Neon Bible took several listens to grow on me...but let's not kid ourselves, it's no Funeral.    I took off 1 star because the album isn't as good as Funeral, and also because the production isn't too good (I know they recorded it in a church).  Also, I'm taking off 0.5 stars because of the totally unnecessary paper wrap for the cd jewel case.  Funeral came in a paper cd case, so I thought they were being very environmentally conscious or their label was cheap.  So I guess they're going to the other extreme now.
B000K4WPCC|4.0|Being a special effects junkie drew me to this movie. So I'd recommend it primarily to my fellow special effects junkies. Given, it isn't a super high budgeted film, so it's on par with any B-movie with decent special effects. I can't say the attractive cast dissuaded my choice at all, either. Eye candy is apparent. The plot was good, but I prefer the deeper storyline I could only hope to find in a book series outlining the history of \\"The Covenant\\" and whatnot. Bibliophiles be warned, if you prefer depth and the slow unraveling of a story, this probably won't be your cup of tea.
B000MCH5P4|3.0|A very dramatic emotional film about one incident that affects four families in different countries throughout the world.  I still haven't figured out the last scene between the Japanese teenager and her father <br />(she is naked on the balcomy of their apartment holding hands with her father).  Anyway, I don't know if I really liked this film or not - I will have to watch it again.
0618680004|5.0|I've read this cover to cover 5 times now, and I still don't get tired of this book. I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who has ever had any doubts about the God Hypothesis. I usually finish each page with a good knee slap and a \\"Yes! Dawkins is SO right!\\". <br /> <br />If you like this book, you will also like Carl Sagan's \\"The Demon-Haunted World\\", which I think should be required reading for every high school senior.
B000683VI4|4.0|For the first 30 minutes of The Notebook, I was wondering what all the fuss was about. All I was seeing was the sort of cheesiness that people groan at in any other movie. The sort of unapologetic lovey-dovey mush that usually gets laughed at. And although some of it is still laughably, hopelessly romantic fodder, it's so honest and intent on its \\"true love will conquer all\\" message that it starts to grow on you.<br /><br />This is due in no small part to Rachel McAdams, and to a lesser extent, Ryan Gosling. The two of them have the ability through their intense display of vulnerabilities to make otherwise corny dialogue seem deep and rooted in emotion. Not to discount Ryan Gosling's great performance, but without Rachel McAdams The Notebook would have been borderline hilarious for its presentation of relationships.<br /><br />Overall, thinking about the story it seems like such a played out love story, but the film is presented so beautifully and intently, that you can't help but be sucked into the world presented in the film and really feel for the characters as they progress in their life and their love lives, together and apart.<br /><br />James Garner is brilliant in the present day portions of the film and really helps ground the emotional core of the relationship and how important love can be. At two hours, The Notebook can start to feel a bit long and perhaps some of the 30 minute setup could be taken out but, as the story insists, some things are worth the commitment.<br /><br />The extras on the DVD are extensive, and include Rachel McAdam's audition tape and some information on the casting process. From her audition alone, which McAdams said she prepared the night before, you can see that she's got the emotional depth to carry a film of this nature.
B000H8SFMK|5.0|Still their best album. <br />Good bonus tracks! <br />These guys rock harder at age 50 than I've ever rocked in my life. <br />
B000KP62MA|5.0|I highly recommend this to any 30STM fan, even those who already have the album - A Beautiful Lie.  The enhanced DVD enables the fan to take a closer look at the making of 'The Kill' video, plus a full version of the video... and other interviews.  The enhanced CD is not to be missed ! <br />For anyone who isn't sure... be curious, dont miss out. <br />Provehito In Altum
074356619X|5.0|I not only have the book, but I have the CDs and the DVD.  It is well worth the time and the money because it gets you back on track or it will teach you how to be on track.  This has serious thoughts and the action will follow.  We have all practiced Law of Attraction even when we had no idea we were.  This book brings life to life on a whole new level.  We all deserve to be on a more spiritual level and go through this world on the plain we were meant to be.  This book can help you get to that level and get what you want and desire out of life.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|This is a dynamic DVD. Everything that Cher does is just Cher!  She is beautiful in her costumes.  Her songs are the ones that we have loved for years.  The entire casting is special and I know if you like Cher as she appeared on TV., you are going to love this DVD.  It truly is a collector's item.  I purchased three: one for myself and two for gifts and the two gift recepients absolutely love this.
B000NA2776|5.0|After reading a majority of the reviews saying that Mika sounds a lot like Freddie Merecury and the Bee Gees, everyone failed to mention Mika sounds exactly like Scissor Sisters. I love this CD , but i'm a bit disappointed that he sounds exactly like Scissor Sisters who i love very much. But i'll still give this CD a 5 stars. Great songs and catchy beats...the bonus song is great...RING RING. Enjoy!!!
B000IJ79UW|5.0|For someone that grew up on Superman, this release is worth every penny because it contains the ORIGINAL THEATRICAL RELEASE!!!!  I want to see the movie I seen as a kid.   Not one that has been adulterated.   I wish they would stop messing with films, and just give us the originals.   Or at least give us an option.
055358202X|3.0|I got about half way thru and starting thinking \\"This is kinda slow moving\\". <br />Lots of names and character and family histories. Martin commonly goes thru a character's entire lineage, even for characters that are barely relevant. <br /> <br />It took until Brienne's battle with Biter 1/2 way thru for me to start thinking \\"Now this is what I was expecting\\". But it doesnt last. <br /> <br />There are many very interesting plot lines, but its mainly all political, very little action. <br /> <br />Definitely worth a read, just dont expect the same level of excitement as in the previous books
B00005JNDZ|2.0|What happened?  Everything that was great about the first movie went terribly wrong in this one.  The first Bridget Jones film was centered on Bridget and Mark Darcy \\"finding\\" each other, sorting out their misconceptions, and ultimately falling in love.  It is a modern re-telling of the core plot of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice: Girl meets guy at party, guy makes disparaging remark to girl, girl spends majority of film (and miniseries) disliking guy, is briefly deceived by villain (Daniel Cleaver, or in the case of P&P, Mr. Wickham), and eventually realizes guy is truly her perfect match.  And to top it all off, girl and guy share passionate kiss at the end of the film (and the miniseries).  Great formula, right?  And then came the second movie... <br /> <br />Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason is supposed to depict the aftermath, or the \\"happily ever after\\" that in this case turns out not to go so \\"happily.\\"  Bridget and Mark Darcy have already been together for a while at the start of the film, but all of the chemistry that they had in the first film is completely gone.  They seem almost estranged.  Mark Darcy is just as icy as he was in the first film, only now that he's got the girl, there's no excuse for it.  It just makes him seem closed off.  Bridget is even more insecure than she was in the first film and gets into even more scrapes, only they don't seem as funny this time around.  Instead of making her feel more secure, her relationship with Mark Darcy appears to have had the opposite effect.  She comes off more as a train wreck than as a delightfully accident prone single girl.  Even in their more intimate moments, they don't really seem like a couple (the ski slope scene in which Bridget realizes that she might be pregnant due to \\"all the weeks of uninterrupted sex they've had\\" begs the question, \\"When, exactly?\\").  I watched the film thinking, \\"How did these two get together?\\" <br /> <br />And then there's the plot.  Gone are the hilarious conversations between Bridget and her friends in the pub, and gone is the subplot involving Bridget's parents.  The parents are hardly featured in this film, and the friends only sporadically. Instead, we have Shazzer, Jed, cocaine, Thailand, way too much on-screen time with Daniel Cleaver, and a beautiful young lawyer who turns out to be a lesbian in love with Bridget.  Huh?  It's like one of those films where they just throw everything in together and take whatever emerges from the mess.  To make it even worse, the mood of the film is inconsistent.  It starts off attempting to be funny, then gets very dark after Bridget is imprisoned in Thailand on drug charges.  All of a sudden we've gone from comedy to drama, then back to comedy after she is released.  The film is a roller coaster, and in more ways than one. <br /> <br />Overall, it is simply a bad sequel, as so many other sequels have been before it.  Stick to the first movie.  At least you'll still have the \\"promise\\" that something great will happen. <br /> <br />
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|i'm obsessed with three cheers for revenge, but i was surprised at how the band kept its creative integrity with this album. its like every song is a surprise in itself. i love it. i happily purchased the cd and consider it an act of supporting pure genius!

B000B0QOJA|5.0|If you are new to Trane this might not be the place to start but then again, understanding the enormity of his musicianship is part of the essence of knowing Coltrane's music. Personally, I have beeen listening to Coltrane since he was alive and thriving and pushing the limits of jazz. What you will find on this gem is exactly that, pushing the music, jazz music specifically, beyond the usual perceptions.  His legendary solos are captured here and one highlight of this disc is the extended version of the lovely and unique interpretation of \\"My Favorite Things.\\" Coming in at over 22 minutes this beautiful song allows Trane  to express the things he couldn't on his album of the same name. The driving drum beats pounded by Elvin Jones, the extended solos and  lingering piano work of McCoy Tyner and thumping, solid bass of Jimmy Garrison are perfect companions to the relentless notes coming out of Trane's horn. His improvisation is a lesson in the  technique of going out there and bringing it all back home. Melodic yet challenging, Trane's vision is never more eloquent than on this song. Your jaw will drop. The grunts and groans of the musicians, the silence of the crowd probaly from being in awe in the presence of greatness and the erruption of fans apreciation will put you in the Half Note some forty-three years ago. This is the classic quartet at it's height. The extreme \\"One up ,One Down\\" opens with Garrison reaching out for your ear as the quartet slowly fills in and goes beyond the limits of comprehension as to how long a song can be stretched. Coming in at nearly 28 minutes any musician can benefit from listening and a casual or rabid jazz can only marvel at the stamina, endurance and intensity of Trane's classic quartet and omnipotent horn. The spiritual quality of Trane's music is expressed in \\"Song of Praise\\", which is about as intense as it can get. I can only imagine the concentration, admire the effort from afar, many years since that night in New York but I can feel his energy anew with the release recently of this priceless masterpiece from the vaults.  The individual songs each have their own attraction but the complete performance is the way the disc should be appreciated; it is a study in the complex world of jazz outside the paradigm. The announcers voice and breaking up of the music offers a glimpse into the real world of performance where the breaks are barely long enough to wipe the sweat from one's brow; Trane and his quartet must have been sweating profusly and barely had enough time to quench their thirst before entertaining again. If you are a jazz fan you will love this disc. If you are a Trane fan you will experience nirvana listening to him blow again. This is recommended for any serious music fans collection; Trane lives on as his legacy continues to grow.It doesn't get much better than this.I can feel his energy anew with the release recently of this priceless masterpiece from the vaults.

B000AARKOO|4.0|Ok,I'm gonna list the things about the movie that I liked.    -Acting was fantastic(especially Bloom,who seems an entirely different actor than the one in \\"Pirates\\").  -Period accuracy(in warfare,dialogue,and overall actions).  -The score was compelling and totally fitting for the mood(Harry-Greggson Williams from Narnia was the composer).  -Moral obligation(Bloom's character is driven by an honest desire to do right.This rather sets him apart from many other characters of like movie genre who are driven by honour,glory,and basically to defend the innocent,which isn't bad.It's just a different perspective than his).  -Great battle sequences(Although there is violence to spare,the viewer is often spared the vision of beheadings,goring,and carnage in great detail,although there is quite a bit of blood.But I found that the viewer is often given adequate warning for other disturbing images.The battles themselves are brilliant with stunning choreography and a general understanding of war tactics.The besieging of Jerusalem is not unlike the storming of Minas Tirith in the Lord of the Rings).  -The love story(Bloom's character refrains from taking the woman he loves as his own because she is married and a queen.There is only one brief scene of \\"love\\" between them which is good.Her husband dies and he gets her anyways so it all works out).  -The growth of the main character(he goes from a grieving blacksmith to a student of a great warrior to a leader of a town to the commander of the army.His personal developement is gripping,too).  The things that I didn't like were early in the movie and soon dealt with(rapid progression and unrealistic circumstances),so I enjoyed the movie quite well.  Entertaining and enlightening,this movie is a really good one.It is a bit long and may take patience to finish it,but it is worth watching.Sorry if I ruined the story for you.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|A bit of a letdown, to be honest. The Chili Peppers pumped out two great albums in a row with Californication and By the Way, and we've been anticipating something new for four years, and then we learn it's a double album, and it ends up being a good two hours of music, but it's lacking that something that makes it great. It's possible it's just a fault with the multi-album format, it's harder to maintain a high level of quality for something that lasts that long. There are plenty of great songs to be found, but because of the sheer number, a lot of them blend together into solid, but unremarkable funky-pop-rock-whatever. None of it's bad, it's just stretched a little thin. Flea can still play bass like no one's business, and John Frusciante continues to hone his craft as one of the best guitarists in the world, and Anthony Keidis can actually sing these days. What they need to do next is go back to focusing on a smaller, more focused project. Not that they have to, with the mountains of money they must be swimming in. <br /> <br />Good songs: \\"Dani California\\", \\"Snow (Hey Oh)\\", \\"Torture Me\\", and \\"We Believe\\".  There are plenty more, but those all jump to mind.  I think the first disc is more enjoyable, but the second has its merits as well.
B000H3096A|4.0|if you're looking to add some vibes to your jazz collection, this is a fine fine album, and would make a good choice. mr hutcherson is a fantastic vibes player, and is joined here by herbie hancock on piano, bob cranshaw on bass, and joe chambers on drums. the entire album is special, but the tune that i really want to give a shout out about is \\"bouquet,\\" a stunningly gorgeous slow-tempo piece that has soul-stirring interplay between the bass and vibes. one of my favorite slow jazz numbers of all-time. if you are considering picking up a copy of this album, i say \\"do it!\\"
B000F3AAUW|5.0|Cee-lo, who I don't know much about, and Danger Mouse, who did the intriguing Grey Album, combine to form a band that isn't really hip-hop, but takes a lot of its best elements, adds in a distinctive, good voice and great, um... producing, and ends up making one of the best songs ever. No, really, \\"Crazy\\" is up there. It's just a good song. It's not the only one either, as every single track is at least catchy, and most are unique, well constructed, and truly interesting. I can see why it wouldn't be for everyone, but I enjoy the hell out of it. <br /> <br />Other great songs are \\"Smiley Faces\\", \\"Just a Thought\\", which is probably the most serious, the crazy \\"Transformer\\", and creepy-but-fun \\"Necromancer\\".
B000002UAR|5.0|i am 45 years old, and have been a music fanatic since about the age of 14. this is a band from the sixties that i somehow missed until about a month ago (which is very exciting for me, since the sixties is my favorite era of music). anyway, i saw a used copy of this at my local music store, and on a whim i picked it up (i'm like that, always open to try out something different). wow. what a find! this is a very good band. they sing nice, and have songs with very good melodies. there's a song here called \\"yellow submarine,\\" which i really love. it's about some people who live on a yellow submarine. nice. anyway, i recommend this group to anyone who, like me, is always on the look out for something different. next payday i think i might look for other albums by this group. i see amazon has some. i will probably buy some of them. thank you for reading my writing.
0321344758|5.0|With 342 mostly strongly favorable reviews by other readers as of the date that I write this, I have little to add about the content. I do want to applaud the author and the entire publishing team for the beautiful design of the book itself. (See publisher New Riders books by noted author Jakob Nielsen for similar publishing excellence.)  Chapter organization, page layout, typography, illustrations, paper stock, and use of color combine to make the content clear.<br /><br />Web and book design of course share many concepts. It is no wonder that legendary magazine designer Roger Black had written a foreword ending with, \\"The principles that Steve shares are going to stay the same, no matter what happens with the Internet... So pull up a chair and relax.\\"<br /><br />The book is a joy to behold as well as to read and would make an excellent gift.
B000MTFFZY|4.0|I discovered Delain one day when I was looking up more information on Within Temptation and it's band members. I discovered that Martijn Westerholt had suffered from Pfeiffer's Disease and thus had to leave Within Temptation in 2001 but that he had preservered and started his own band called Delain in 2002. I decided to look up this band. I found their official site where I was able to hear what they had to offer. It was very good so I got my hands on their first full length album, Lucidity.<br /><br />I love the music on this album. I'm a fan of symphonic metal and Lucidity is a very beautiful album. It has the beautiful guitars that I love so dearly, bass, drums, keyboards, *Deep Sigh* It's very rare, in my experience, to find a relatively new band that plays very well together. The vocals of Charlotte Wessels are unique and interesting. In a world where most of the female fronted bands have high soprano singers, Charlotte is refreshing with her serene yet spunky (poppy) sound. I recommend Delain for those who like Symphonic Metal but want a change of pace from the lovely high soprano vocalists. I also recommend they check out Delain's official website or look for them at My Space and listen to what the band has to offer before they decide to buy this item!
0060734191|5.0|The land of death opens up in front of the reader of this surprising fairytale. The author adroitly juxtaposes a realistically drawn modern world with an ancient magical kingdom where the doors between life and death open easily, and the perilous journey into darkness becomes more often than not reversible. The epic quest entices the reader with unique tools of enchantment, such as the charmed servants and paper planes, to explore the differences between the rational and the intuitive world, and dares them to trod the path not easily taken. <br /> <br />The character that readers can probably identify with the most of the triology is Lirael. As child and young adult she feels thoroughly alienated by her immediate surroundings, a feeling that no doubt is shared by many. In the end she discovers that much like the ugly duckling she has powers far beyond those of her peers, leading to a thoroughly satisfying ending of the triology. Lirael much reminded me of the woman in [[ASIN:1419660608 The Woman and The Raven]].
0780622553|5.0|I view this movie as a classic.  It is one of those that not everyone has heard of.
0812550757|5.0|I recently asked a friend who enjoys science fiction to recommend a title for me. Speaker for the Dead was his choice. I was deeply moved by the novel and plan to read more of Card's work. The last time I shed a tear while reading was with The Kite Runner. Different books, of course, but both share an emotional intensity, seriousness of purpose, and reverence for the mystery that is life. SFTDead knocked me off my feet.  <br /> <br />I'm not well versed enough in SciFi to comment on the book's structure, where it fits with other works. But it stands on its own as a moving novel. It transcends genre.
B00000K31V|5.0|I rented this a while back and wanted a copy for my library.  If you like plot twists and heavy sci-fi you will like this movie.  It is kind of grusome in several scenes and probably not for little kids.

B000JBWWRY|5.0|Very well done - it brings back childhood memories from long ago.
B000063JZQ|5.0|With the advent of DVDs, I've made it a minor hobby to compare various versions of Shakespeare's plays - especially Othello, Lear and Hamlet.  I did not see Polanski's Macbeth until recently but have been aware of it for decades.    In my view this is the single most powerful film adaptation of any Shakespeare play.  Though much too intense for children or even most teens,  Polanski's artful direction captures the insanity, mysticism, jealousy, hate, and horror of the playwright's most brutal work perfectly. The settings are gloomy but realistic and the acting is uniformly excellent.     If Polanski never made another film, he would still be remembered for vividly capturing the complex intensity of this play.  Even jaded modern audiences are emotionally exhausted at the film's end- which is not easy to do in this age of ubiquitous violence and sex.      This is no holds barred Shakespeare; definitely not for the faint of heart.

B000E97Y6K|3.0|I've just watched the first two hours of this and in another session will get to the end no doubt. This movie is simply too long, there is no justification for a potboiler like this being three hours long.<br /><br />The beginning was pretty poor, Jack Black overacts in the opening section of the film and only Naomi Watts performance kept me watching (less is more Jack). The appearance of the natives on the island changed everything, suddenly this was much more interesting, and eventually after a lot of time had passed Kong appeared.<br /><br />Kong is hugely impressive, this is a spectacular CGI creation and credit to all involved for this aspect of the film. However at this point the dinosaurs appeared and I'm afraid things started going wrong again. Our wonderful heroine (who has kept me watching) is now in serious trouble. She doesn't really trust Kong but the place is full of dinosaurs. But it doesn't matter she escapes, narrowly avoids being eaten by medium size dinosaur, outruns a T-Rex, avoids another T-Rex, is recaptured by Kong, who then fights three T-Rex's whilst carrying our heroine. They all fall into large ravine being saved by vines where the fight continues.... at this point I had to take a break.<br /><br />I know, this is a fantasy, and no doubt kids will love it, but come on some small attempt at realism would add so much to the film. So far the best thing in the film is the CGI Kong - and thats great because if Kong is rubbish then you are in serious trouble. So my ratings so far are:<br /><br />Kong - 5 Stars<br /><br />Naomi Watts - 4 Stars<br /><br />Jack Black - 2 Stars<br /><br />Script - 2 stars<br /><br />Direction - 3 stars<br /><br />See you at the end eventually.

B0000DZ3EA|3.0|Going back to Genesis in the early 70's I've been a big fan of Gabriel. If you've heard any of these tunes on the radio, or otherwise, you might want to start with this hit 2 CD offering. Can't comment on the bad engineering since I do not have this CD (no need since I have most all of Peter's previous offerings. Always great production and interesting textures, lyrics, arrangements in Gabriel's music. A few of my top album choices would be UP, SO, melted face, 1st album w/ salsbury hill. He's even better in concert...Amazing is the word.
0385333846|5.0|Though Kurt Vonnegut's most popular work has been called both Science Fiction and an an alternate view of how we should view time, I'm not so sure.<br /><br />I don't think Pilgrim was ever actually unstuck in time, but he did have flashbacks to his life in Dresden and often lapsed into fantasies about aliens keeping him captive with a playmate. As Pilgrim is unable to distinguish between fantasy and reality, he believes that the aliens who have him under their control are able to propell him back into the past as well as forward into the future.<br /><br />But it's hard to pin down the ideas of the genius who authored the work, and each reader will take what he or she will from the dark humor and social insights of the author. So it goes.<br /><br />This work stands out as both a pioneering work of modernist steam-of-consciousness techniques and a work of post-modernist chaos. It is ironic that it was a candidte for censorship in many school systems, in that Vonnegut was one of the twenty first centuries strongest champions of free speech.<br /><br />I also found the continuation of Hemmingway's portrayal of the \\"Great American Boyman\\" in the descriptions of the American POWs to be an important criticism of our culture...one that we should be aware of in the age of metrosexualization. I often suspect that Vonnegut's relation of how the American POWs dealt with their imprisonment in Dresden and his observance that success is \\"damn hard\\" in America, despite our being taught that it's the \\"Land of Opportunity,\\" were the real reasons why political factions wanted it banned.<br /><br />Like many of his old time fans, I was saddened to hear of his death today and a resurgence of the love for his work has once again awakened in me. I'm dusting his books off now, as I'm sure many others are as well all around the world.
B000H309Q0|5.0|Peter Hammill ( Van Der Graaf Generator ) hit the mark with this solo album. Strong Lyrics and songs that will catch your ear and make you stop and listen. \\"Vision\\" is a best of album that might be a better place to sample Hammill. Fools mate, Cameleon and Silent Corner are other great places when exploring progressive alternative music from the early 70's. Hammill has one of the most forceful voices you've ever heard anywhere!! He delivers each song with enough emotional conviction to draw you in. Some dark & depressing tunes and lyrics, as well as interesting ballad and experimental sounds await your here.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|I recently bought this movie for a friend of mine's three-year-old daughter not only because it is a beautiful story, it is also a nostalgic (but not saccharine) tale of a boy's innocence and imagination.  Moreso, it reminds me very much of the Wintertide's of my childhood in rural Warwickshire in England. At the sign of the first heavy snow we would rush out and beginning rolling the snowball that would form our snowman's body. It truly was a care-free time; a time without adult worries; a time devoid of adult cynicism.  In the words of Housman \\"That is the land of lost content, I see it shining plain.  The happy highways where I went, but cannot come again.\\"
B000MV9026|4.0|Warner Bros. are still out there milking the surprisingly popular penguin movies, and they continue the trend with Happy Feet. A charming video of how penguin use there vocal talents too attract mates, but when an unlucky penguin gets neglected as an egg, it turn his singing disastorus. But on the bright side, he devoples a quick talent of tap-dancing, which gets him labeled as a freak, and is exiled out of his flock. Now, he must find a way to come back to his flock to impress the love of his life. <br /> <br /> Happy Feet uses brght, attracting colors and animation that would even give Pixar a run for it's money, by giving you a charming cast of characters from love advise penguins to a click of mexican penguins, that will make the experience even more unforgetable. Besides the cool penguins and the pretty colors, the only reason I'm giving this movie four stars is that I didn't like the high speed chases between the sea lions and orcas, some kids in the theater were scared from those sences, so make sure your children(or you, if your a weiny) don't have an aphobia to them. <br />

0743496728|5.0|This is the first of Picoult's novel that I have read: I can indulge with the usual cliches about the material being a page-turner, the one you cannot put down, the kind that will give you a sleepless night in your attempt to consume the tome in a single sitting. Yet there is no charm in this novel ... aside from the beauty in a painful reading.   <br /> <br />Picoult's incisive insight despite moments of protractedness gives a glimpse into the world of confused and confusing youngsters as they move against a world all too cruel in its impersonation of pecking order and social norms.  The author's understanding that there is a thin line between good and evil -- in its best and worst forms -- provides sympathy even to what conformity can so easily prejudge as monsters and demons moving around us. <br /> <br />The corruption of innocence, the pain of isolation, the mockery that accompanies a society that does not recognize the different but only rewards the popular and the purportedly \\"beautiful\\" --- these are what make \\"Nineteen Minutes\\" last far much longer in the memory and consciousness of its reader.
B00023B1LC|3.0|If you haven't read the book, you'll probably enjoy the movie. <br /> <br />If you are a real fan of the Ludlum books, however, pass up this movie.  It wanders much further away from Ludlum than it has to, and the sequel is even worse.  Get the Richard Chamberlain version instead. <br /> <br />
B000O178BY|4.0|I've been a big NIN fan for years. I don't think I'll ever forget [[ASIN:B00001P4TH The Fragile]], because after hearing that album, my life has not been the same. I went back and the other three albums were pretty good (yes, I'm calling [[ASIN:B000001Y5J Broken]] an album). I have to admit that I was very disappointed two years ago with [[ASIN:B000929AJQ With Teeth]]. It had a few moments, but I didn't like hearing a guy into his 40's writing more middle school poetry. And also, some songs would've been finely arranged without the inclusion of some kind of annoying things. <br /> <br />\\"Year Zero\\" sounds nothing like the other NIN albums, really. It's hard for me to compare the record to what came before it. Although unlike \\"Teeth,\\" it all is kind of a coherent theme throughout. The music fits well with the concept as well, as some of this does actually sound apocalyptic. My favorite song of these is probably \\"Vessels,\\" an industrial classic on this record. Instrumentals come back here too, as in the short opening track and also \\"Another Version of the Truth.\\" There are lots of sounds and elements here that amaze me. The lyrics here are not seventh grade poetry, instead, it's more like a commentary of the direction of the world. Another great sonic track is \\"My Violent Heart,\\" which follows through the eerie intro of \\"The Warning.\\" There's still a kind of funky feel in some of the songs, like \\"Capital G,\\" and there's a nice trip-hop sound in \\"Me, I'm Not.\\" The record is excellent, and because it sounds nothing like previous endeavors, I'm hesitant to call it a \\"return to form.\\" Still, what you get here is above average, definitely. <br /> <br />If you like NIN, you should give it a chance, and probably will if you're loyal enough. While I don't enjoy it as much as the first three yet and probably never will to the level of \\"The Fragile,\\" it is a worthwhile addition to your collection.
B000NA28IE|1.0|When Eragon came out in the theaters I wanted to go see it, but didn't have time. When it came out on disc I was still too busy. My cousing let me borrow her books to read while at work. Loved the books so I wanted to rent the movie. I can honestly say I was sorely dissapointed. This movie is not \\"Faithfully adapted.\\" It's not even a good synopsis of the books. There is so much left out of the movie it seems as if the movie studio was concerned about time more than accurately portraying the film as a faithful rendition of the books. Don't waste your money on this movie.
B0007YMUZW|4.0|Ryan Adams is a truely talented artist.  Every album shows his depth in a variety of musical genres.  His voice has an almost chameleon quality that lets him sound like a completely different artist from song to song.  Influences from all over the musical spectrum show up in his music. <br /> <br />However....with the newly formed Cardinals, Adams seems to be harkening back to his Whiskeytown days.  This album (and it's acutally a double album) has a much more alternative country feeling.  This isn't a bad thing.  He even adds to repetoire of musical diversity pulling from the Eagles (Easy Plateau) and Van Morrison (Dance all Night).  I just personally think that he does his best work in the haunting melodies of albums like Demolitions, Gold, and Love is Hell.  This is still a pretty good album and definately worth a buy for fans.  This is the first of three albums he released in 2005.  The flurry of work kind of shows and takes it's toll in this first one.  The first half of this double album doesn't hold a candle to the second.  I almost wish Amazon let you use half stars because the first half is 3 and the second a 4.  All the real standout material like Easy Plateau, Let It Ride, If I Am A Stranger, and Dance All Night come from disc two.  Don't let the mixed singles put you off.  This is a good album with some real gems.  Just don't expect Gold of Love Is Hell.  Cold Roses is a very different album.
0156027321|4.0|I had been meaning to read this book for a long time.  It was nothing like I expected.  There were points of this book in which I forced myself to continue to read.  I am really glad I read the book and it did make me think a lot.
B000MGUZM0|4.0|The latest gospel by The Arcade Fire reads like a retrospective book of revelations criticizing the superpower of the US.  <br />Unlike their debut Funeral, which was akin to a seven-year-old Robert Smith going through an existential crisis / nervous breakdown, with a side order of child's vivid imagination and the horrors of discovering ones own mortality. It would seem our child has grown up and taken on a persona darker and bleaker than six Trent Reznors listening to Joy Division, discussing the Myth Of Sisyphus watching a Bergman film, re-edited by David Lynch being re-scripted by a less annoying, less faux sentimental, Michael Moore. Part political protest, part dark nightmare vision of what might be. Be under no illusion Win and friends have made a black album, saved by the fact that it never descends into the self destructive nihilism of Reznor et al, due to the fact it seems preoccupied with change and a yearning for a better world, though flirts dangerously close to either self indulgence or slight lack of variation (I can't decide.). Even tracks like the albums sure-fie hit and most obvious single `Keep The Car Running' is underscored by a dark lyrics tickling the belly of dissatisfaction with a tag team of Mandolin and Hurdy-Gurdy. It's steeped in the need to escape, a sense of loss of one's personal identity. Themes which litter the album, sharing shades in common with such albums as Pink Floyds 'Final Cut`. Whilst having the class and elegance to not name names and point fingers, unlike `The Fletcher Memorial Home`. Yes, I'm saying T.A.F. might one day be considered more relevant timeless and important than the Floyd.  <br />It's that good.  <br />Why? <br />It sort of falls into somewhere ethereal, and timeless. Somewhere it could speak to any generation in despair of what they will, not only represent in history, but what they might be responsible for, and not be able to stare themselves in the mirror for being part of. `Windowsill' captures this perfectly, asking the question, what do I represent? What have I signed up to? and have I become so apathetic that the bad guys are doing bad things in my name and I agreed to it? As if our generation has become one giant Homer Simpson smacking ourselves on the head yelping `D'oh!' <br />Due to this Neon Bible's greatest weakness becomes it's greatest strength, it's very reason why it is essential listening to anyone who believes in the power of music, and desperate to identify with our current political climate whilst like its namesake and inspiration by John Kennedy Toole shares thematic identity. It mixes the politics of Dylan with the rejected persona of Springsteen's Vietnam everyman generation. So much so later tracks go so far as to make Springsteen's style a skeleton to hang their muscles upon.  <br />Their choice to include the glorious `No Cars Go' is a master stroke. Almost taking place as The Arcade Fires anthem, and taking the climax of Neon Bible as their own glimmer of hope. A triumph of innocence over cynicism, and the materialism of politics and organised religion (presented here as firm bed fellows.) and the wars fought on their behalf. As a song it can be looked simply as a chance to record a live favourite. However, the more shrewd listener will notice its significance within the overall narrative of the almost inadvertent conceptual structure of the record. Which is also another of the potential flaws of conceptual music. Often it can become a little self involved. Luckily The Arcade Fire almost manage to sidestep (for the time being- time will tell) that landmine by not outstaying there welcome too long, unlike albums such as `The Wall'. At a mere 47 mins it more often than not leaves you wanting the 12\\" disco version of some tracks. Proving that Win and friends have managed the welcome skill of the ability to self edit. A skill missing ten years ago by loosely conceptual albums by a certain Mr. Corgan.  <br />There is however a question I have. Should Funeral have not been such an unmitigated success the world over, would it's follow up not have been a little more eclectic, would they have explored their French roots deeper, since Regine is relegated to half a song and a couple of phrases throughout. Feels a little unbalanced- but a minor quibble. <br />The one personal message I've learned from Neon Bible is that it's rare to fall in love with the same thing twice.  <br />Just as hard.  <br />Like a lover.  <br />Funeral, took us by surprise.  <br />Neon Bible, even though we knew it was coming, proved itself complex enough to invest ones self in and give in to completely.  <br />Do yourself a favour and clear your musical calendar for the next month. This is all you'll want to listen to.
0812550706|1.0|I know this is going to make me unpopular, but it must be said: It seems to me that this book has become famous for being famous. I can't account for the overwhelming popularity in any other way. <br /> <br />It isn't particularly well written, although others who disliked it gave it credit for technical proficiency. It is essentially a story about bullies, video games and cookie cutter characters bought for half price at the Stereotype Barn and jazzed up with reflective neon tape applied to their fender flares. The misery of plodding through page after page of what amounts to the Lazer Tag Semi-Galactic Finals is made incalculably worse by the glacially slow pace at which these less-than-riveting events unfold. It's like enduring a root canal in slow motion. Without benefit of anesthesia. While the dental assissant reads aloud the latest celebrity gossip congealing around Paris Hilton. Ok, to be fair, it's not QUITE that bad, but lord! it sure ain't good. I can suspend belief with the best of 'em, but I have limits, and nothing these children do or say strikes me as being authentic. The problem with so many novels that feature young children or teens as their protaganists is that the author is writing through a filter; he is attempting to reconstruct the thoughts, feelings and dialogue of childhood from the perspective of adulthood. Please read 'Tom Sawyer' again and compare it with 'Ender's Game'. The disparity is glaring. <br /> <br />Comparing this to the genuine classics of the genre does not improve Ender's overall credibility. Both Frank Herbert's 'Dune' and Joe Haldeman's 'Forever War' are so much more compelling and thought-provoking. If you rated this book 5 stars do yourself a favor and give the titles mentioned a shot--you'll be rating them at 10 stars or beyond. :-) <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />

However, my son was so anxious to finish the book that he took it everywhere with him for several days.  According to my son, Hugo Cabret is a very interesting character and anyone who reads the book will love it.
0385333846|5.0|Slaughter House Five was the first Vonnegut book I read back in high school. He had a knack for maintaining a readers attention while leaping to new characters and scenes without warning.  It's been a while since I've picked up a Vonnegut book.

BIG UP to the cast and musch respect to dem shotta mad max
B000069KGM|5.0|Chicago is a nasty city.  The sports teams always lose, the weather is that of extremes (bitter cold, stifling, humid summers), and it tends to get ignored in favour of NYC and L.A..  But some great music came out of that city, and Chicago (the band) is an example.  This is one of the greatest debuts in rock history, an album full of life, vigor, experimentation, intelligence, and rock and roll.  Terry Kath especially shines on this album, with his blistering guitar work on Introduction, Poem 58 (his best song here), and Free Form Guitar.  Most people who grew up listening to Chicago in the 1980's when they were making pop friendly, AOR music would absolutely freak at this song, and most of this album.  There are pop tracks, like Does Anybody Know What Time It Is? and Beginnings, but they are adventurous, complex pop songs, and Lamm's piano solo on Time (usually edited on the single version) is beautiful.  KAth's gravely voice is as amazing as his guitar work.  Their cover of I'm a Man is better than Winwood's original, and Liberation is an amazing track in which to conclude.  It's 14 1/2 minutes of jazz/rock fusion mayhem.  Chicago was as good as any jazz/rock, prog rock band out there for the first 4 albums or so.  Their pop songs, while not awful, certainly didn't have the adventure you have here.
0618680004|5.0|Very well written book with through understanding of the subject, keen observations, command over language and logically sound foundation. <br /> <br />Impressive work. I wonder what took Mr. Dawkin 30 years to say what he says in this book after he published his first best seller \\"the selfish gene\\". May be he was just evolving in his thinking ;-).
B0002HSECC|5.0|Emerson, Lake, and Palmer are my favorite prog rock band, and this is arguably their most balanced album as a band.  On most of their albums, Emerson and Palmer dominated the proceedings, while Lake diddled on his bass guitar, usually playing a simple riff or two while Keith and Carl ripped their instruments a new one.  Lake only really shined during the ballads, and probably resented Emerson and Palmer (Emerson especially) for their domination of the band.  This album strikes a beautiful balance between all three.  The opener, The Barbarian, opens with a killer guitar riff (yes, guitar), then breaks into a blistering version of Bartok's Allegro Barbaro (even though Emerson, Lake, and Palmer are credited with the song).  The second song, Take a Pebble, is Greg Lake's most underrated ballad, and it's a damn shame, because it is one of his best songs, and one of ELP's best songs.  It's an epic Greg Lake song running 12 1/2 minutes (usually the epic were courtesy of Emerson), and it boasts some great lyrics and amazing beautiful piano work by Emerson.  Knife Edge has some great bass playing by Greg, which blends it beautifully with Emerson and Palmer.  The Three Fates is mostly Emerson, until the final segment, when they all join in.  Tank is a great Palmer drum workout, with excellent keyboard work from Keith and another great bass line from Greg, and Lucky Man closes it.  It's Greg's signature song, and it's really all him.  The synthesizer solo at the end was an add on.  Greg wanted to give Keith something to do on the song, so Keith improvised the solo.  ELP would get bigger and better with longer tracks (Tarkus, Karn Evil 9), but here they share more of the music.  I'm not saying this is their best album (that's the triple live one), but it's certainly as good as anything they ever put out...
B000JJSRNY|5.0|This concert is a treat for all opera lovers. The selections are wonderful, the singers deliver as hoped and the sound is glorious. I admit that I am a huge fan of Netrebko and what more can anyone say about Domingo. Villazon is in good voice as well.  I certainly didnt know about this when it took place but what  a wonderful gift to us from DG.  Pick up a copy of the Netrebko-Villazon duet cd as well
0374105235|5.0|This book was an amazing and startling tale of a young boy and his horrific movement through Sierra Leone and becoming a boy soldier. This book is for the person who is interested in learning more about the continuous civil war and human rights violations brought on by the goverment and rebel forces of Serria Leone. I think more people should know about these violations, reading this book will break your heart but will leave you wanting to learn more and understand what we can't see and hope for an end.
B000NVIGC0|2.0|I'm disappointed too.  There are just too many mid-tempo mellow rainy afternoon songs strung together.  Nels tries to inject some lively guitar fills but it's not enough to get things going.  Glenn must have been bored stiff recording this album.    The band and all their personalities may have worked well together during the recording session, but the loss of any real conflict turned this album into a snoozer.    I still miss Jay's rambling piano playing.
B00005JMJG|4.0|3.5 stars.  Renting this despite the fact that my best friend hated this movie, I was pleasantly surprised that I actually liked this movie.  Definitely more of a art-house sort of feature, I was nevertheless intrigued by this movie's premises, just a tad bit underwhelmed by the execution.  I like Kate Winlet, but found her character kooky for kooky sake just a little under developed.  Still, I agree that it is an orignal piece and a different spin on romantic comedies, even if in this case you don't quite connect with these people as a couple.  Overall, it's worth your wild to take a look at this film.
B000F39M9W|4.0|This disc contains three of my favorite pieces of music, all extremely well played and in excellently recorded sound. That said, two of the pieces--The Rite and The Night--come in forms not usually heard. While one piece, in my personal judgement, suffers a bit (you can't really accuse Mussorgsky of pulling Stokowski's punches, since Mussorgsky wrote the piece, but that's what it feels like...) this disc makes for fun and adventurous listening.<br /><br />Maestro Salonen is the man. Let's get that out up front. If he's not the greatest working conductor today then he's damn close.<br /><br />Salonen and his forces get the job done here. So much is made of the fact that this thing was recorded at Disney's new music hall that one fears this music and the muscians who do such an excellent job playing it might get overlooked. That would be a shame.<br /><br />While I slightly prefer Ivan Fischer's Mandarin, the one found here is great as well. Usually on discs with programs like this you expect at least one lemon. In this case, I had expected that the Bartok would suffer.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised that I was wrong.<br /><br />This Rite of Spring stands with Stravinsky's own recording on CBS as one of my favorites. Yes, as other people have noted, this is the revised version. Still, this recording has all the thunder and emotion you could want from this piece.<br /><br />I've already kind of shared my opinion on the Mussorgsky. Stokowski was a much better arranger than Mussorgsky was a composer. Still, the spark of life that Stoki drew out inhabits the original--and either way, listening for those differences keeps you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />This is fun music. This is a great disc. You should not hesitate to get a copy.<br /><br />I give this disc my full recommendation.
B00006I53S|4.0|I really liked the lens but I received a bad copy and had to send it back. The front element was loose so it jerked when focusing each picture. The lens is a bit heavy but seemed very solid. Wish I could say more about it. I did get a full refund.
B000JJRIN4|1.0|With each passing album, her music gets worse.  The track \\"The Sweet Escape\\" makes me think of smiling dancing teddy bears with balloons and giant lollipops.  The yodeling in the first track is unforgivable.  The song should not be played under any circumstances.  I wish she would put out a new album with No Doubt - some ska-ish tunes would be nice.
B00008OE4W|5.0|Delightful caper flick enhanced by its deft handling of a rather preposterous plot. Great characters and terrific casting (Dan Aykroyd's conspiracy theorist perpetually sparring with ex-CIA agent Sidney Poitier, Ben Kingsley brilliant as usual, etc.) plus a really good score. The technology in the movie is completely dated but it holds up anyway. One of my favorites.<br /><br />This DVD comes with a clever and insightful though not earthshattering director's commentary.
B000FVQYZY|5.0|The best album of last year from the greatest band on the planet! <br /> <br />Need I say more?
B0007OASII|5.0|A sterling fusion of melodic power metal and classical orchestra.  The current pinnacle of progressive metal.  My favorite album of all time.  I've given this one to all my friends, and bought myself several copies to archive.  'Nuff said.
B000EHSVQE|4.0|This made a great gift for my 13 year nephew. He loved it!
B000003TAR|5.0|Kurt's voice was edgy and raw, yet still had a Americanized mainstream-like sound. I wish he was still around as I would have like to see where he would have taken his direction of upcoming releases.<br />I first heard this about 1995, one year after Kurt Cobain's death.<br />In Utero(1993) is one of the first Cds I ever bought, back in junior high school. I had \\"Nevermind\\" on cassette.  To me, Nevermind- a sleeker, more polished sounding release.<br />\\"Heart Shaped Box\\" - is the video that inspired me to buy this album. It just sounded so cool, w/ bright colors & death like themes (hospitals, man on a cross, black waters). \\"HSB\\" remains my favorite song by Nirvana.<br />From start to finish opening w/ \\"Serve the Servants\\" and ending w/ the closer \\"All Apologies\\"- this is just a more raw and mature and visual w/ lyrics of \\"umblical noose\\" - \\"meat-eating orchids\\" - \\"magnet tar pit\\" - \\"rape\\" among others, just more descriptive and real.<br />This also brings Nirvana a return to their roots & not conforming to what the media, record company & fans wanted to hear after \\"Nevermind.\\"<br />This was no mainstream grunge-accessible pop like everyone wanted, but to me it BLOWS \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" and the rest of their 1991 Hit, AWAY!
B000B8QF14|5.0|I love lots of different rock music, but I had never been sold on Green Day.  Something about their music, and especially the production of their sound on their studio albums, did not appeal to me.  This DVD/Cd combo changed my mind and got me listening to some songs over and over again.  It has a frenetic energy that I didn't find in their studio work.  I don't much like the unnecessary cussing, but I can overlook it when the songs are this good.  I find it amusing to see a punk band use so many pretty vocal harmonies.  Songs I couldn't bear to listen to on the albums suddenly were quite good here in concert, such as 'Basket Case' and 'Brain Stew'.  Most of the stuff from 'American Idiot' is great here also.
B000001ESP|5.0|Great album from our Canadian power trio, containing some of the best classic songs like Tom Sawer, Red Barchetta, YYZ and Limelight. <br />The other tracks, less known, are also great ones. <br />Impressive musicianship, Prog rock at its best, you can go wrong !
B000EULJLU|5.0|I am amazed at some of the comments I have read.  I would think by now most Tool lovers would know that you have to let some of their stuff simmer for awhile before you can pass judgement.  My first listen to this album did not impress me much, but I know now how wrong my first impression was.  It took a few listens, but I now consider this the best Tool album (though I don't bother to count a couple of the songs that are truly just bad, such as Viginti Tres- this happens on all Tool albums).  I have four of the songs from this album with 5 stars in my library, which beats out the brilliant Aenima and Lateralus.  I still can't tell which is my favorite song, though it is between 'The Pot' and 'Right In Two'.  'Vicarious' and 'Jambi' are also excellent, if not quite as amazing as the first two I listed.  'Rosetta Stoned' is interesting and creative, though I don't find myself listening to it nearly as much as the others.
B00006690G|1.0|Sorry, but this is exactly the kind of cd that I can't hear. <br />I just don't like it, really horrible !
B000006TSC|5.0|Breathless is a bit different from the previous Camel albums.  This one seems to be all about pretty vocal melodies, instead of instrumental jams.  While I'd call myself more of a jam person, I would NEVER knock this album.  The melodies are really good.  \\"wing and a prayer\\" is a pleasant upbeat song that takes me back to my childhood, and \\"rainbow's end\\" is SUCH a sad song and great way to end the album.  \\"down on the farm\\" is a great example of interesting and flawless vocal work.  Great album overall.  I love the album cover too.  A closeup of a camel!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I recently finished watching the series on DVD and enjoyed it, but I was blown away by this movie.  I enjoyed it so much that I immediately watched it again with commentary by Joss Whedon.      For me the standouts in a fine cast were Nathan Fillion and Summer Glau.  Glau's fight sequences were astounding and surprising considering that her character spent most of the series in a catatonic state.  There are also some surprises that will shock fans of the series.    Finally I was very impressed with the cinematography and lighting.  I highly recommend the Whedon commentary to gain an even greater appreciation of some of the intricacies of this very fine film.
B000002KB8|5.0|It's been a tradition of mine for years now to listen to either a Black Sabbath or Blue Oyster Cult album on Friday the 13th.  Of course, Sabbath's debut was released on a Friday the 13th (in 1970).   <br /> <br />The album cover is truly spooky.  Look at that thing.  It looks like a witch, or maybe some demon.  The grainy background with the trees and the house probably makes you think about the Blair Witch Project... except that movie wasn't scary or very good.  This debut album is fantastic. <br /> <br />It's been said a million times that Black Sabbath's debut gave us a much louder and darker version of hard rock that wasn't previously heard before then, so there's no need to touch on that. <br /> <br />Let's talk about why I love this album.  The production is incredibly good.  No other hard rock album released before 1970 ever sounded this clear, loud, and amazing (and trust me, I've heard them all).  Every other hard rock album had at least a *little* bit of a muddy sound to indicate it's an old album.  You'd never tell this album came out in 1970. <br /> <br />The best possible way you can open a hard rock album is found right here with the title song \\"black sabbath\\".  A quiet thunderstorm starts the thing, and then \\"duuuuuuuuuun DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN du-U-u-U-u-U-u-U-u-U\\" (with church bells!) riff appears out of nowhere.  An incredibly loud and influential guitar riff right there.  The part at the end when it speeds up gives the listener a feeling of incredible overwhelming fear.  What are you running from?  The devil! <br /> <br />\\"the wizard\\" has really good harmonica work, especially the solo in the middle.  The first time I heard this song I was taken back and confused how a harmonica and a guitar riff could be playing the same notes *at the same time*.  It's unlike ANYTHING I've ever heard. <br /> <br />\\"behind the wall of sleep\\" reminds me of the guitar-dizzy middle section of \\"war pigs\\" but with a more \\"army march-forward\\" kind of thing.  Any minute I expect Ozzy to scream I DON'T KNOW WHAT I BEEN TOLD.  \\"nib\\" is a cute little song.  Well, lyrically it's FAR from cute, hehe. <br /> <br />\\"wicked world\\" reminds me of Earth Day.  I can just picture people picking up trash along the highway while listening to this song.  It's a pretty cool song, too.  It's a loud straight-forward electric blues song that Sabbath have never attempted anything like it before or since.  You might want to hear this song and take special notice of it.   <br /> <br />The last 15 minutes of the album features a lengthy jam with all sorts of twists and turns that will remind you of Jimi Hendrix, Cream, Iron Butterfly, and all sorts of bands.  It's so good.   <br /> <br />I can't believe how LOUD, CLEAR and AWESOME Sabbath's debut album is.  Those are the three big important words used to describe this baby.  Buy it now.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|Will Farrell(nominated for a Golden Globe for his role as Harold Crick in this movie), Maggie Gyllenhaal, Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson, really shining crew and good performance. <br />According to Wikipedia, The film borrows heavily from Niebla by Miguel de Unamuno, a Spanish novel about a character who becomes aware he is being narrated by a writer and goes to visit him. However, in Unamuno's story, the main character commits suicide. Why this movie is categorized as comedy, at least, I don't think so. I recommend this movie, but I think if you want something \\"very comedy\\", it's not for you <br /> <br />
B000A6T262|5.0|Having all of these movies all together is wonderful and I have enjoyed watching the extras that I never saw when I had a few of these on VHS.  Great investment if you like Star Trek, now my children are enjoying Star Trek too.
B00004IC9G|5.0|Manowar's first and what a great album. It was awesome to hear this for the first time today. Dark Avenger and Battle Hymn are terrific. I loved hearing the two songs that set the foundation of Manowar's triumphant sound. I love the other songs on the album as well. It has a great 80's sound that I enjoy. Hail To The Kings Of Metal!
B0009IW98O|5.0|This is a forgotten gem. Seger makes these covers better than the originals and even on the slow numbers he's burning. The Bo Diddly workout is just a warm up. Love the One You're With wasn't even this soulful when the Neville Bros. covered it (hard to believe, but true!) Even the Four Tops couldn't do If I Were A Carpenter with this much heart and heat, nevermind Tim Hardin, who wrote it.  Leon Russel's Hummingbird is an improvement on the original as well. Then there's the cover of one of Chuck Berry's more obscure titles. Heavy Music seems to sum up what this collection is all about. I believe what makes all these covers so good is that frills (like strings) have been dispensed with. There's just voice and a bare bones backing band and they don't hold back. That, my freinds, is rock and roll.
B000NA2776|5.0|Looks like plenty of other people have logged in to either gush wildly about Mika, or complain bitterly about his last concert (rather than the recording in question).  As someone old enough to actually remember when Queen and Freddie Mercury were new instead of retro, I don't know if I agree with all the comparisons being made here.  Mika's clearly masterful at constructing seamless, highly polished pop, with a flexible, wide-ranging voice, and an ability to invent hooks that embed in your brain and stick.  That's not an easy thing to do: good bubblegum is not that easy to construct.  This music is a confection, and as delightful (and nearly addictive) as candy.  But I also hear a darker current in these songs: the \\"admirer\\" who keeps calling and calling on the phone, the person who prompts the line \\"I don't care if I ever talk to you again,\\" the ex who is encouraged to take that unfortunate emotional phone message he didn't mean to leave and \\"Erase\\" it, and the genuinely despondent \\"Happy Ending,\\" all indicate that the \\"Love\\" that \\"everybody\\" is in today has its problems.  I look forward to Mika's ongoing development as a songwriter.
B000001ES9|2.0|If Neil Peart hadn't come along we wouldn't be talking about Rush today. That's just how it is. This first album is fine if you think of it as an historical artifact. Here we see the raw talents of Lee and Lifeson first displayed. It's clear that Lee especially is a great talent on bass. However the lyrics are banal, when not silly, and Lee's voice just doesn't work with some of the macho swagger stuff like \\"In the Mood.\\" Is it any wonder we never here most of this stuff live? Now, we can listen to the music and look at the pictures in this album and see young men who are so obviously dreaming of being rock and roll stars and compare them to the older, wiser, and more musically sophisticated men who, 33 years later (!) are 'making memories' for us under the moniker RUSH.
B0000646UN|5.0|Be forwarned!  The US version of this film is 70 minutes shorter than the original version of 195 minutes.  You are missing a lot!  The PAL version, as far as I know, is only available in the EU.
B00003CXB2|5.0|This is a great movie. Brings out many aspects of TE Lawerence's life.
B00001QEG5|4.0|I liked the album to begin with, and I like it even more with the bonus songs. There is one thing everyone seems to agree upon. This is not the usual TS album. The 'Live at Wacken' extras, and I think the behind the music special, tell us that this was supposed to be a Dee Snider solo record, but the label wanted a TS album. In retrospect, after 'Come Out And Play' I think a change of pace was good for TS. That gives us 'Love Is For Suckers'. I thought the album cover was a creative illustration for the title. I have to agree that 'Wake Up (The Sleeping Giant)' and 'Yeah Right!' are the heavy hitters on this one. Wake Up could have been a huge hit had it arrived a couple years sooner. The overall content is different in its references to women/sex, but that goes with the theme of the title. The music does come across softer than previous TS offerings as well. Songs like the title track, 'Me And The Boys', 'One Bad Habit', and 'Tonight' are solid tracks. 'Hot Love', 'I'm So Hot For You', and 'You Are All That I Need', which are good songs, really represent the rock scene in the late eighties. Had Bon Jovi or Poison put these out they probably would have been hits... but Twisted Sister? Good songs, just out of character.    I really enjoyed the bonus songs. 'If That's What You Want' and 'Feel Appeal' are the strongest I would say.  I give this remastered album 4 stars. I would give the original 1987 version 3 stars.
B000002KBU|5.0|I remember when this album came out. I lived in a house with a group of friends. One guy was going through a breakup with his girlfriend and used to lock himself in his room and listen to \\"river\\" over, and over, and over again. Needless to say, it drove everyone nuts. However, this remains my favorite Joni Mitchell album. This flight tonight (later rocked up by nazareth) and \\"Case of you\\"...the whole album's great!! The title \\"blue\\" is very apt. This is, in many ways Joni Mitchell's equivalent of Clapton's Derek and the Dominoes. On this album Joni Mitchell achieves art of a true \\"blues\\" caliber while remaining within her own unique style. Not a small achievement!! She will move on to explore other styles, including Jazz. However, to me, this remains her greatest moment. Also, forget all those rumors about her not being able to \\"tune her guitar\\". Along with Richie Havens, Joni Mitchell was one of the most original and creative rhythm players of her generation. This album is essential listening for fans of any style of music.
B000GPI2EK|5.0|Believe the hype. This is one of the most important metal releases of the decade. Not only does it set a new standard for Mastodon, but it sets the bar higher for virtually every other band out there. I doubt we'll see another piece of music this brilliant before the decade is over. Guitar riffs as big as, well, a mastodon and vocals ranging from screaming to straight singing. They incorporate a lot of melody into the cd, but it doesn't lose any of it's heaviness. The musicianship is incredible. \\"Colony of Birchmen\\" is their current single, but the rest of the album varies in speed and style. If you love metal, there is no way you will not love this cd.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|This is the first CD that I purchased by John Mayer and I plan to purchase more. This is one of the most talented misicians that I have experienced in a long time. He appeals to all age groups. I have a 29 year old daughter and she is totally into him. I'm sure anyone who purchases this CD will like it just as much as I have.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|Are you kidding me? this movie is beyond the Amazon rating system, a classic, a MUST HAVE for any and all movie lovers. Get OUT!  James Stewart at his ABSOLUTE BEST! kisses and hugs and love abounds after you check this flick out. GET IT, WATCH IT, LOVE IT!
B000002KIK|3.0|I'm almost appalled when I see some people actually giving this album 5 stars.  'Black Sabbath' thru 'Sabotage' are five star albums.  The reason for giving this album a generous three stars is because 'Never Say Die', 'Johnny Blade' and 'Junior's Eyes' are all killer cuts  -- especially the latter with its killer rythem.  From there it's all down hill.  'Hard Road' is tolerable but gets repetitive. 'Shock Wave' and 'Over To You' are okay.  'Breakout' and 'Swinging the Chain' is fill material.  Which brings me to the worst Sabbath track of all time -- 'Air Dance'.  Sorry,  but my Sabbath does not contain the lyrics 'In days of romance, she was the queen of dance, she'd dance the night away.' Ugh. If I didn't know Ozzy's voice any better I'd think I was listening to freakin' Abba.  I'm embarrased I can even remember these lyrics.  <br /> <br />A sad ending to the Ozzy era and rightly so since they'd obviously run out of ideas.  While you can't expect another 'Paranoid',  Sabbath did rebound with 'Heaven & Hell' and 'Mob Rules' and Ozzy rebounded with two classics.

B000HEWEE4|2.0|In the movie they dance to a Paul McCartney song that Sandra Bullock says she knows, but the dance took place in 2004 and the song wasn't released until 2005. I guess love letters weren't the only things traveling in time.
0439813786|4.0|I am reading this to my 7 year old son and we're both enjoying it immensely. It is a well written story with hints and clues that pulled us in right from the start. We're half way through and it's not losing its appeal. Most impressive are the illustrations that take over the story telling from time to time. Sometimes we flip through quickly as we follow a character throught the streets of France, for instance -- other times my son lingers on an illustrated page, looking at all the details and searching for hidden clues.<br /><br />I heard the author on NPR and was completely charmed. I bought the book having only seen the cover and knowing that there was something wonderful inside. It has exceeded my expectations. Mr. Selznick's efforts have given us a wonderful gift -- my little family is certainly enjoying it.

B00005JMK0|5.0|1984 was a banner year for me for going to the theater for movies, This is Spinal Tap, Star Trek III, Gremlins, Ghostbusters, Dune, 2010 Oddessy II, Starman, The Never Ending Story, The Last Starfighter, the list goes on.  But one of my personal favorites was Electric Dreams, Virginia Madsen particularly and the music, while MTVish at times (remember when MTV Did music videos?) was pretty cool, even the Boy George songs.  I figured with the Virginia's Oscar nomination, this movie would be almost instantly on DVD.  Come on, it's a computer movie!!!!  It's geek heaven!!!!!!

B0002J4ZWS|1.0|I don't get this movie at all.  People say it's so great, but I'm always like, \\"what's so great about it?  It's like Stir Crazy, but without Gene Wilder.\\"  And, I'm sorry, but Gene Wilder is great in that movie.  Stir Crazy, that is--not Shawshank Redemption, which he is not in. <br /> <br />If you haven't seen Shawshank Redemption, don't bother.  Here's the story: two criminals are in prison in the 1960s and they become friends while they're in jail.  The end.  Sorry you just wasted your time and money, folks.  Not to sound like a broken record, but does that sound like a better story than say this one: A married man is tempted by an alluring woman in red, and practically throws his life away as his obsession with her grows.  That movie is called Woman in Red.  Now, which one sounds more interesting to you? <br /> <br />Meanwhile, back in prison, the two gentleman played by Morgan Freeman (Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves) and Tim Robbins (Cadillac Man) plan to break out of jail, but their plans are doomed.  That part starts to get interesting, until you realize that this is just another way that Hollywood glamorizes prison life and why should we be rooting for prisoners to break out of jail anyway?  If there were a movie about Jeffrey Dahmer and Charles Manson becoming friends and then they try to break out of prison, I would not be cheering them on.  That's what so hypocritical about the media, these days! <br /> <br />I won't ruin the ending where someone important is dead, but I will say that I have no idea why people get so involved in a movie like this that pales in comparison to, say, a movie with real action like \\"The Rock\\" or \\"Silver Streak.\\" <br /> <br />If you see The Shawshank Redemption, just remember that it is going to be a disappointment and you'll probably feel depressed about your life for weeks to come.

Ray Winstone also delivers a superb performance as the menacing, authoritative Mr. French, Costello's most trusted enforcer.  <br /> <br />The music of The Rolling Stones constantly drones in and out during the film, providing excellent atmosphere for a crime flick set on the mean streets.  <br /> <br />\\"The Departed\\" is a instant classic, a great movie for fans of gritty, violent crime dramas ala \\"The Sopranos\\". Scorsese continues to exhibit his mastery for this genre of film, his best work to date.
B000H305U0|4.0|First off, I don't like SexyBack. I never did, I never will. Its one of the most generic songs ever written, and it just does not make any sense, even in a cheesy, pop, fun way. Granted it had its audience that loved it, but for me it's the lowest point in Justins' music catalogue (even lower than the early NSync days - though musically I gotta say NSync did have some melodious and memorable numbers, for whats its worth).<br /><br />I'm looking at this record without SexyBack, and its looking like a four star record, which is certainly a good thing. My favorite song here is \\"What Goes Around Comes Around\\", which eerily reminded me of Madonna's \\"Easy Ride\\" from her \\"American Life\\" (that was a really deep, metaphysical song, to me at least). Justin accomplishes on this one song what he promised us throughout his first album \\"Justified\\", and delivers solidly.<br /><br />This album is fantastic, no doubt, but the great thing is that it embraces various genres without wanting to be any one genre. In the process, Justin creates a new identity for himself and does not get lost WITHIN an identity (such as Christina Aguilera on \\"Back to Basics\\" - which was an overproduced abomination if there ever was one). This is best exemplified on songs that have no apparent melody (such as \\"My Love\\") that actually transcend the weak material from which they were honed.<br /><br />Get this album. It may not change your life, but you'll have a great time listening to it, for sure.

0380002930|2.0|Few works of fiction revolving around animals ever become literature classics.  Animal Farm and the Secret of Nimh are two examples, this is another.  This daunting piece of \\"children's\\" literature tells the story of a warren of rabbits that leave their home after one of their kind has visions of doom.  Leave they do, and travel they must, eventually settling in another place.  But after settling, they must then find females to mate with in order to populate a new warren.  This of course they do.      Though written for children, the themes covered in this book are more appropriate for adults.  These include sex, reproduction, courtship, fighting over mates, death, visions of doom, life as a refugee, territorial conflicts, and inter-generational conflict.  Some of the dialogue and descriptions are quite graphic.  After reading this book, one discovers that many of the themes covered are quite similar to those found in human societies and covered in other classics of literature; though with one exception; humans don't get eaten like some of the rabbits do in this book.  This reviewer found the book boring and requiring great effort to get through.  I would not recommend it to anyone under 10 as the book quickly gets boring.

B000N6TX1I|5.0|I didn't know what I was expecting when I went to see \\"Children of Men\\". I heard a little about it but I wasn't thinking that it was going to be that good. I was pleasently surprized. \\"Children of Men\\" is an amazing film. It's the best Sci Fi film that I've seen in the past five years and one of the best ever. The plot of \\"Children of Men\\" is women can no longer have babies. Knowing that it's days are numbered, society begins to crumble under a wave of violence and anarchy. There is a ray of hope in the form of a teenage girl and her unborn baby.Enter Clive Owen, who's job is to protect the girl and the possible future of the human race from a group of terrorist who want her dead. The icing on the cake is definately the cinematography,the likes of which I've havn't seen sence \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" Many of the most intense action sequences were filmed with a single continuous shot which adds a really beautiful and unique feel to the film. \\"Children Of men\\" is Sci-Fi and action at it's best. Add it to your must see list now.

B00005JMAH|4.0|After experiencing the monotony of the first two films, I never expected I would go back to watch another.<br /><br />The only reason I started viewing this third installment is when Guillermo del Toro mentioned the film in a video interview posted on the website Rotten Tomatoes.  I found out that the director of Pan's Labyrinth, a superb film that revives and restores the original and true meaning of the authentic fairy tale, had either collaborated on this third Harry Potter film or was somehow connected to it.  If my statement as to the connection between del Toro and Harry Potter 3 sounds too abstract, that would be because the video on that site has since been edited down, so I cannot confirm or remember how he was connected.  I will provide indirect evidence shortly, but let me continue with my story.<br /><br />The year of 2006 has already become known as the year of the Mexican directors because the three most important films of the year were directed by Mexicans, as you would have guessed.  The first film is Babel, directed by Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu.  The second film is Children of Men, directed by Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n.  And, the third film is Pan's Labyrinth, directed by Guillermo del Toro.  These are the top three films of 2006, all directed by people from Mexico.  Guillermo del Toro was not responsible for directing Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban; that was directed by Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, of Children of Men.  Anyway, the name of this particular Harry Potter film had kept popping up one-way-or-another in my research, so I borrowed the film from a friend and watched it.<br /><br />I found that Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was remarkably similar to del Toro's new fantasy film Pan's Labyrinth, a film which had greatly impressed me for its dark and adult themes.  And, seeing that del Toro's name had not been credited on the DVD box made me remember the trailers I'd seen on Rotten Tomatoes for Pan's Labyrinth where del Toro mentions The Prisoner of Azkaban.  And so, this is my dilemma: one of the videos there for Pan's Labyrinth had been either altered or omitted.  I did not invent this story, but, admittedly, I probably don't seem too credible right now.  So, the only way I can explain is by talking about the similarities between The Prisoner of Azkaban and Pan's Labyrinth.<br /><br />They are similar.  The \\"Alice\\" character in Pan's Labyrinth goes under a tree trunk to take the key from the toad that lives there.  In Potter 3, it's Harry who goes under the tree.  In Pan's Labyrinth, the \\"Alice\\" character discovers a magical book that writes itself just before an action occurs.  In Harry, there is a magical book that tells Harry who is near him like a GPS monitor.  In Pan's Labyrinth, the \\"Alice\\" character draws chalk marks on her bedroom walls to create doors into another place.  In Potter 3, the house under the tree constantly moves with the tree.<br /><br />Pan's Labyrinth probably cost less than Potter 3, so del Toro wouldn't want to dump a lot of money into computer graphics, especially since he wanted to emulate the visual style of the stop-motion Harryhausen-animated fantasy films anyway, according to the interview still available on Rotten Tomatoes; in the Potter film, Hagrid shows to the students a creature called a hippogriff named \\"Buckbeak,\\" a creature appearing as a cross between Harryhausen's chicken in Mysterious Island to the Pegasus in Clash of the Titans.  Also, there are at least two darkness-related monsters in both films: the dementors and the werewolves in Potter 3; and, Pan and the Pale Man in Pan's Labyrinth.  There are also a few small--as in having a small size--characters in both films: the fairies in Pan's Labyrinth and the were-rat in Potter 3.  Additionally, they are both extremely dark films, especially for a fairy tale like Pan's Labyrinth, and especially for a film franchise that never used darkness in its vision until its third incarnation, directed by a man who, coincidentally, is also a Mexican.  The two visual styles have too much in common for me to ignore a memory because I can't corroborate it, or even fully understand the mode of their connection, but they are connected, regardless.<br /><br />Since I haven't provided anything but a choppy review so far, let me make some semblance of a claim here.  This Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the only Harry Potter film of the four so far that actually held an interest.  The first two, directed by Chris Columbus, were based on very superficial plots that bored me to tears.  His second one was much better than his first one, but the two still longed greatly for depth.  Chris Columbus must've been listening to the consensual advice which probably sounded something like what I'm saying now about depth, and so the second would've had to have been an improvement over the first, but it wasn't enough.  The fourth one is directed by Mike Newell who has occasionally done good work, like the Al Pacino-Johnny Depp film Donnie Brasco; but, this is a different kind of film altogether, and a different kind of budget, too, and maintains that status quo of two-dimensional superficiality preoccupying this franchise.<br /><br />With The Prisoner of Azkaban, despite sitting though some similar nonsense that created problems with the rest of the films in the franchise--action without substance--this one actually has a lot of substance and it uses it to express the action, most of the time, except for those occasionally lapses back into the \\"Potter-esque\\" brainlessness that seems done as though it were a prerequisite to the Potter name.  Except for this, it was much more of an interesting film than all of the others put together.  Forgive me for saying so, but I also wish to note that the work of John Williams would have to befit the same lack of intellectuality that accompanied many of Spielberg's earlier films, which I did not like; luckily, he has become slightly more tolerable over the years, but not much, in his attempts at imitating the great Bernard Herrmann who composed Citizen Kane and several peak-Hitchcock films.<br /><br />I particularly liked the scene on the train near the beginning which reminded me of the classic Hitchcock train sequences of films like North by Northwest, and the Val Lewton-produced film by the classic horror director Jacques Torneur, The Night of the Demon (a.k.a. The Curse of the Demon) where at the end of the film the psychologist-protagonist is trying to pass the runic scroll back to the sorcerer who gave it to him.  There's even an homage through an unrelated conversation on \\"Ancient Runes.\\"  The train sequence is very short, but it creates an immediate feeling of spookiness that is right out of the best of the classic horror films.<br /><br />The \\"boggart\\" is a monster of the id in this film, and this shape-shifting creature appears throughout the film, but the film generally doesn't delve in to the meaning of the subconscious mind maybe as much as other films like Forbidden Planet or Frankenstein, but it is integrated in with the story and more than a plot-based curiosity.<br /><br />One scene has all the students sleeping in a main room so the teachers can keep an eye on the students while the dementors are outside.  The idea for this part of the script might've come from Dario Argento's finest horror film, Suspiria, where, because of a student who is murdered, the teachers order the students of the dance school to sleep in the gymnasium, separated from the teachers merely by hung sheets.<br /><br />The ending with the werewolf fight in the forest at the end of the film is also very dark and an homage to the old Hammer Studio-styled visuals.<br /><br />The very beginning of the film, when Harry is having dinner with his family, reminded me of the Roald Dahl stories like The Twits or James and the Giant Peach, and this part seems done with some competence in its fantasy elements.Even here, the film provides more depth than its others in the franchise.<br /><br />Actually, the film is nearly nothing like the franchise in that everything can be associated to some form of depth, either by the visual imagery or by the subconsciousness of the protagonist, like the scene where the English double-decker bus picks up Harry from his home.  Additionally, the acting is much more quantifiable here than before, and the pedigree of the cast appears higher, or at least the roles and the dialogue do.<br /><br />Now that I've given just a little too much away, you can go see for yourself what I mean.great Bernard Herrmann who composed Citizen Kane and several peak-Hitchcock films.

0618680004|4.0|For those of us struggling with our disbelief of a superior being this book helps put in words that are simple to understand, the basis for religion, faith and a higher belief. In todays society, in which faith based initiatives seem to run all US policy it is nice to be handed information to combat the nonsense. I highly recommend Chapter 5 The Roots of Religion, if you only want to get a taste for how non believers think. I thought the final chapter was a little weak in what otherwise was a very well thought out book.

0553582453|4.0|This book is much better than the first book in this series, as it has much more to offer in terms of plot.  However, most of the substance of this book is dervied from small events, and small revelations, which fill the book up like puzzle pieces that provide little clue as to how the series will conclude.  Few things happen in this book that seem to have a lot of signficance in terms of the master plot (which is incredibly vague) or taken on their own account, but they offer lots of room for speculation (which some space is devoted to Fitz's own speculation as to what is going on) and on the whole it provides a slightly different form of entertainment.<br /><br />The other theme of this book (really the series) is relationships.  Fitz deals with the loss of the wolf.  Fitz's relationship with his estranged daughter.  Fitz's relationship with the minstrel Starling.  Fitz's relationship with the hedgewitch Jinna.  Hap's relationships with girls and work, combined with Fitz's fatherly relationship with Hap and his associates.  Fitz's relationship with the half-wit Thick.  Fitz's relationship with the queen Ketricken.  Fitz's relationship with Chade.  Fitz's relationship with the huntress Laurel and the Old Blood, and the Piebalds.  The Queen's relationship with the Witted.  Prince Dutiful's relationship with the Witted and with the Narcheska.  Fitz's relationship with Prince Dutiful. And, finally, Fitz's relatioship with the Fool.<br /><br />If that doesn't sound confusing, you missed the point.  There is a lot going on here, relationship-wise, and this, for this book IS the story.  Well, if you toss in spying and speculating and the Skill then that is pretty much the story.<br /><br />This series has a similar plot derivative of the first series.  If you compare both series, you notice Book one, 1) Fitz develops 2) Conflict is explained;  Book two 1) Conflict develops further 2) the Quest is found to fix it 3) Fitz nearly dies; Book three 1)Conflic climaxes 2)Quest develops and concludes.  Now in the first series, Fitz actually does die, but he is revived so neatly, you might consider it a \\"near death\\" experience like in this series.  I haven't read the third book in this series, but I pretty much expect it to be similar.<br /><br />As in all my reviews, I protest Fitz ever being classified as an assassin, but the use of that title is minimized in this series, and actually, Fitz seems more brutal in this series anyway.  Not necessarily assassin type, more of a thug, and capable of casual violence (in the previous series it was self-defense or defending the king)...  just not steathful like an assassin.  It's not that I love violence, but I like characters to be described accurately is all.  Assassins should at least seem capable of despicable behavior.<br /><br />My other qualm in this book particually is the magic of the Skill.  I don't understand:<br /><br />1) why it is common (in this book we learn that there are many weakly skilled people:  does this mean many royal bastards had illegitamate children who became common folk?  Remember Shrewd said that even Fitz should marry someone who was a noble?)<br /><br />2) why not everyone is trained (like in the first series, and I believe it was explained that it should be limited to royalty, but in this series there are many people who have it and develop it all on their own with no training, so holding back training prevents what?)<br /><br />3) why you can heal with it (isn't the Wit the one that has to do with \\"life-force?\\")  What does telepathy have to do with healing?<br /><br />I expect more explanation in the third book, and Hobb can be good at tying up loose ends, but overall the experience in these books pales in comparison to the live-ship traders series.  I feel Fitz never developed properly as a character, despite all his hardships.  There should have been more conflict in his life besides Regal's torture and his own problems dealing with his inability to marry the girl he chooses.  Conflict that could have brough out some inner strength, some heroic qualities, some more solid formation of Fitz's identity.  These are absent, and since Fitz takes a break from reality and postpones finding himself a purposeful life in the first half of Fool's Errand, Fitz is left with this bizarre array of relationships with no clear direction.<br /><br />The parallels in this book are there.  The parallels with what Fitz wants for Hap and what Fitz wants for himself.  The parallels with what Fitz wants for Dutiful and what Dutiful wants for himself.  Now, Fitz has a high born son and a common son, and does he want something different for both?<br /><br />Clearly the ending has something to do with both the Skill and the whole Robert Jordan inspired \\"wheel of time\\" type thing with the white prophet and the catalyst.  I must say, I am eager to find out how the series ends, because there are a lot of things here I am anxious to see resolved.<br /><br />The rating is high because of the anticipation created rather than my actual enjoyment of the book itself.  The book itself I would rate a three, but since I am overall harsh on the Farseer and Tawny Man trilogys, I will be gracious with my four star rating...he chooses.

B000MXPE7O|3.0|Top names cannot overcome this kludge of a movie, which loses one star for kludge and one star for not remotely honoring what the original OSS and the CIA clandestine service really do.  In fact, as a former spy who spent three touirs overseas including one chasing terrorists, this movie, while artsy and compelling in its mash-up of 50 years of mis-adventure, is very disappointing.  They would have been better off sticking to Mr. and Mrs. Smith, which I enjoyed very much as a parody.<br /><br />Until the 1980's, the chief characteristics of the Directorate of Operations of which I was a part, were alcoholism, adultery, divorce, and suicide.  I count 18 suicides in my professional career, beginning with the instructor at the Farm that blew his brains out with a shot-gun, and more recently the Staff Director of the House Permanent Select Committee of Intelligence, and a much admired SES (flag) officer who tried to drum the \\"Langley Strangler\\" out of the agency.  Now that's a movie I would be glad to help make.  Today we simply have too many puppies and dilitantes.<br /><br />There is one good aspect: the whole concept of not trusting anyone.  There is another good aspect: enemy opposites can be friends.  Indeed, I have found over the years that I like and trust my KGB and GRU counterparts more than I trust the drones in our own FBI (Agents IC Smith and Crowley excepted).<br /><br />A sideline highlight was the depiction of the Yale fraternity Skull and Bones, to which both George Bush Junior and John Kerry belong.  The overtones of homosexuality, men mud-wrestling naked, men in drag, is consistent with the public information undertones about some of its members.<br /><br />The bad aspect is that this movie tries to represent 50 years of history including all the apects of James Angleton, Kim Philby, and so on, but it is a fantasy, a poor parody.  You would be much better off reading my lists of intelligence and counterintelligence books.  Recruiting people to be traitors, stealing diplomatic pouches, installing audio devices, managing covert action operations are all more interesting.<br /><br />The entire theme of trying to interpret a video to identify the fan, the sounds, the voices, etc is over-hyped garbage, even with the revelation that the witness knows the video is of himself not so long ago.  CIA throws money in the air, and whoever reaches for it is recruited as an agent.  Let me be very specific: CIA is a global laughingstock, and does nothing for the Nation that is worth its cost.  It consists of too many young white males, and no amount of diversity hiring is going to change the basic fact that working out of official installations, and unilaterally (or worse, relying on foreign liaison headquarters for second-hand lies) is going to turn CIA into a mature clandestine and analytic service.<br /><br />The coldness of the business, and the distance between father and son, between husband and wife, is dated.  That is how it was up to the 1970's.  After that, wives were a part of the team and not only fully briefed, but used operationally on occasikon.  Children generally are briefed when they reach their low teens.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is a melange that melanges a bit too much.  Great stars, interesting script, for a real look at the old CIA, see Allen Dulles, \\"The Craft of Intelligence\\", and Miles Copeland, \\"Without Cloak or Dagger\\".  For the lies and politicization, see George Allen, \\"None So Blind\\" or Hiam's \\"Who the Hell are we Fighting.\\"  For CIA at the top of its game, see \\"JAWBREAKER\\" and \\"First In.\\"<br /><br />This is one instance where books are much better than any DVD.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|I don't care what anyone else says -- Daniel Craig is a GREAT Bond! The first chase scene is just spectacular! I don't know how those guys do it -- they must be in great shape. Judi Dench is always a favorite -- the whole movie is full of action and suspense. And the ending is just right for a Bond flick.

0440237688|5.0|After reading this book years ago, I came across the title when searching for a book for a younger cousin.  This book is capable of conveying several observations without requiring a thousand pages to do it.  This ability is very similar to how Billy Budd and Bartleby, the Scrivner(in my opinion)far surpasses Moby Dick as the best of Herman Melville, yet both are often overlooked for their compact size.  This book is far too oftern overlooked as being a \\"children's\\" book.  I believe as an \\"adult\\" it is these terms which narrow the mind.  It is as absurd as considering Oliver Twist just for children. As far as the plot goes, consider this the \\"youth-friendly\\" version of Ayn Rand's Anthem. It is an excellent read; heavy, yet hopeful.
B000069I1H|5.0|My friends and I have a longstanding argument to try and name the three best Eddie Murphy movies.<br /><br />And shucks, wouldn;t you know it, we can all only come up with two: 48 Hours and Trading Places. Afer that, there's a huge falloff and no one can come up with a film that gets more than a star and a half.<br /><br />We finally decided that this film would merit the third spot. But only because it had Robert DeNiro in it, not because of its quality.<br /><br />Anyway, I thought it was funny the way Eddie Murphy stormed out of the Oscars after he didn't win for Showgirls. It was very reminiscent of the way I leave the theatre after about 30 minutes of most of his films.<br /><br />God Bless You Eddie!
B000N3SS80|4.0|Jennifer Lopez first Spanish album is a solid effort.  She took a risk with this album, and I personally think it was a good one.  Her voice is stronger and the songs for the most part are good. They are well written and good production. I still do not like the song I can't belive this is me. In english or spanish, this song is just too big for her voice. Overall though, big improvement. Way to go J.Lo!!!
B0000012XC|4.0|Wilhelm Kempff is most certainly among the most humane pianists in recorded history. This cannot be denied - even apart from his luminescent interpretations, you will hear him play a Bach chorale on the organ in the Church of Peace at Hiroshima on the bonus disc of this cycle. Sibelius once told him that he did not play \\"like a pianist, but like a human being\\". From his personality, one may already see what to expect in his playing... <br /> <br />First I'll get through his late sonatas. I am one of the few people I know of who is neither absolutely enthralled nor put off by his renditions of the final five sonatas. The last five of Beethoven's are works almost infinite in their range of emotion, spirituality, and even technicality, and no pianist I have ever heard plays all five of them equally well. As for Kempff, I notice two big keys in the way he plays them, one positive and one not so much. Bad news first: When it comes to the slow movements, he simply plays them too fast and too lightly. While he lets every note ring out beautifully, he does not allow his listener time to soak in the slower parts, such as the beginnings of the final movements of Op. 109 and Op. 111 as well as (and much more imporantly so) the adagio in Hammerklavier. This Adagio is undeniably a masterpiece - it goes through periods where it floats along pensively and wistfully to points where it bleeds with dark eroticism. Kempff's adagio has credit as a nocturnal whisper, but I do not feel it fully captures these elements of that work, mostly because of the speed at which he plays it (only about 15 minutes long, as opposed to its average length of about 17 - 19 minutes). However, Kempff's luminenscence provides us with an almost unique experience in many other parts of the late Beethovens... he almost seems to capture in his playing of certain parts the hours Ludwig spent at the keyboard improvising until he was content with what he heard. The fugues of Op. 110 and Hammerklavier, as well asthe variations in Op. 111 are so magnificently and brightly portrayed, that it is impossible for me not to be taken by them every time I hear them.  <br /> <br />As for the middle period sonatas (in my view those are Nos. 12 - 27 with the exception of Nos. 19 & 20 which were written much earlier than they were published, though most academics start the middle period at No. 21), I have not a single complaint with Kempff. These sonatas do not share the same spirituality as the late ones do, instead they are the product of a unity of Beethoven's fertile mind and soul... the middle work portrays Beethoven's dreams and fantasies put to music, for example the Waldstein sonata starts out playful and almost bluesy and ends in a flash of sparkling divinity; Sonata No. 12 begins pensively before sinking into the strange darkness of its funeral march and ending on the waterfalls and moonlit plains of its quick finale. Considering the dreamlike and ever-changing spirituality of these works, it is clear that few are apt to play them better than Kempff does, and I would have paid the price of this cycle for Nos. 12, 15, 21, and 24 alone!  <br /> <br />In terms of the early sonatas, they are not as similar to Mozart as many will have you believe, though they do have their share of Mozartine moments. However, one of the reasons that they are seen as in line with the work of the 18th century classical composers is because of the way in which they should be played. These sonatas are like Beethoven's childhood dreams as opposed to his adulthood ones represented by the middle sonatas, and should be played with smooth flow and great intensity, where it is required (for example in the opening movement of Pathetique or Op. 10/1). In this case, Kempff's renditions do not bother me, but do not excite me either, and I must admit I rarely listen to the first two discs of his cycle... look to Emil Gilels, Solomon Cutner, or even Artur Schnabel for better interpretations of these early sonatas.<br /> <br />On the whole, this cycle is one of the best I own and the lovely box is already showing signs of serious wear and tear after only a year of ownership (I carry it around with me quite a lot), and I would even recommend it as a starter cycle for someone not well acquainted with Beethoven's sonatas. For the early sonatas, look for the pianists I listed above (as well as Grigory Sokolov for Sonata No. 4, unfortunately he has only recorded two Beethoven sonatas in his life). For different (and in some cases better) perspectives on the last five, I'd recommend Maurizio Pollini (ESPECIALLY for Hammerklavier), Stefan Kovacevich, Alfred Brendel (mostly for Op. 109), Claudio Arrau, and many others... <br /> <br />All in all, this cycle definitely has my enthusiastic recommendation.
0743496728|5.0|We've read about too many school shootings.  These are intensely sad events as young lives are ended and harmed while sickening fear is permanently released to further separate communities.  We all blame the parents for being so clueless.<br /><br />I wasn't sure I wanted to read a long novel about such an event.  But I'm glad I did.  Nineteen Minutes takes the bare facts of such an awful day and helps us see the whole experience from every perspective.  And the book does so with a kind and gentle heart.<br /><br />This shifting of the balance of our perceptions is accomplished by several well-performed techniques including many narrators (different students, three parents, the police, the defense attorney, and his wife), connections among the characters, and multiple back stories that reach literally into the womb.  The book's theme is far more universal than school shootings:  How we grow away from our real selves and the damage that does to us and others.<br /><br />I was very impressed by the way that Ms. Picoult viewed every character with mostly sympathy, even when you might think of them as being unsympathetic from the facts.  Each character is also mildly funny.  She doesn't let the tragedy pull us too far away from the realities of everyday life.  It's an extraordinary storytelling gift.<br /><br />If you are like me, you'll probably feel that your faith in people is increased by reading this story rather than the reverse.  That reaction also surprised me.<br /><br />No matter what your age is I think you'll find this book will draw you back into those turbulent teen years when being popular meant way too much.  It'll be an intense and self-revealing visit.<br /><br />Bravo, Ms. Picoult!  This is a remarkable book.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000LPS47U|5.0|Every now and then, a film comes along that remains timeless and treasured for generation after generation, awaiting to be discovered by new viewers.  This isn't one of them, for some people anyway.  Re-Animator is one of the best of the horror/splatter films to come out of the 80's.  Directed by Stuart Gordon and adapted from an H.P. Lovecraft tale (something of which Gordon would frequently do in his films), Re-Animator follows promising med-student Dan Cain (Bruce Abbott) who has it all: a hot girlfriend (frequently naked Barbara Crampton) and a good overall life with a promising future.  This all gets disrupted by the coming of Herbert West (Jeffrey Combs); a brilliant but deranged scientist who has created a serum that can re-animate dead corpses; with bloody violent results.  Regarded as one of the best films of it's type, the original Re-Animator features enough inventive make-up and gore effects to help it stand the test of time, and the pitch black humor only makes the film even better.  Followed by a few sequels, the original Re-Animator is a bona-fide classic.  This new DVD release from Anchor Bay features a new documentary, but for those who already own the previously released Milennium Edition, whether or not this new edition is worth picking up is entirely up to you.
B0006957SA|5.0|I've loved this CD since I bought the original relase around 1990, and decided to pay some more money for the remastered version.  Wow, what a job the studio did remastering it!  A lot of care seems to have gone into the process, and the sound is almost three dimensional:  the clarity of each instrument, the separation, the pounding bass...  The highpoint for me on this CD is \\"Thousands are Sailing,\\" and it's an absolute pleasure to hear it remastered. <br /> <br />If you love the Pogues, but already own the original release of this CD, consider repurchasing the remastered version; you'll be very pleased you did.

1582701709|2.0|The best thing about reading this book is that you'll find no shortage of opinions on it when you ask people. Mention of it has started fascinating discussions for me, although not one person has yet admitted to me that they like it in any way.<br /><br />This book is a bunch of over the top new age nonsense, but sadly it masquerades as a sensible self-help book. In the first few pages it blows past the benefits of mere positive thinking and what it can do for you. No, it continues to suggest repetitively, a la brainwashing techniques, that the Universe is answering your signals. This includes a charming explanation that mass murders and genocide happen when many people believe they're in the wrong place at the wrong time, so voila! Something terrible happens to all of them. No doubt cancer patients spent too much energy writing critical reviews of books they didn't like on Amazon.com earlier in life! Uh-oh.<br /><br />The book provokes good conversation, and it certainly has a target audience. I'm just not part of that audience. Many people love it. Find one who does, and get a personal recommendation for you. If you smirked or nodded your head at anything I wrote here, however, keep going. This is not the self-help book you're looking for.
B000N6U0E2|3.0|Typical Oscar garnering story...its not like you thought he WASN'T going to succeed at any point...I mean, would Dean Witter allow their name to be used if they flunked him and threw him back out on the street?!?!  OK, aside from the story (though based on true events) being overly melodramatic and Will Smiths one note acting (Was this REALLY one of the best acting performances of the year???  REALLY??) it was unoffensive enough to be broadcast on a plane flight with little to no editing...in fact thats what this movie is perfect for...passing a few hours without being asked to think too much...It has a great moral--work hard, expect nothing, don't ask for handouts, accept what life throws at you and move on--and for that, I applaud the film.  Will Smith's son is also very good here as a precocious little boy and the chemistry between the two is excellent...A good film with a great message...just not a GREAT film with a great message...

B0009X7664|1.0|This is a great movie, but this review concerns the packaging that the DVD comes in. Right on the cover it states that 12 reproductions of the original movie poster is included with this \\"special edition.\\" Well, when I opened mine all I found was an empty sleaze!  I was ripped off!  And speaking of ripping. The cover came covered with stickers for some bizzare reason. A advertisement for other Universal DVDs was glued onto the front glue and held on with several large round stickers. When trying to remove the huge ad, the front cover art was torn off and ruined.  <br /> <br />I will be returning this DVD for a full refund, and suggest that other collectors look else where for a DVD copy of this great film.
B000002I2G|5.0|I find it hard to believe that people don't take this album for what it is. A Transitional album were the musicians are attempting new songs and finding a new aspect of there music by introducing new sounds and styles. This album should be compared to The Rolling Stones Beggars Banquet. There are hints of Blue Grass and Country and blues both albums produced exceptionally long songs that are incredible to listen to and that can be squarely referenced in the time period they were created in and yet also sound timeless. Both Albums also sound different in many ways from the prior or later work. If you enjoy understand the whole catalog of a group or artist this is a can't miss album. If you just want the hits don't buy this one.
B000MQC9H4|3.0|Yes its predictable, no the acting isn't anything special, but the movie is good at what it is--an enjoyable, unoffensive, forgetable way to spend a couple hours with your wife/girlfriend...I have found Cameron Diaz to be nearly unbearable to watch in nearly every role she has had but here she is palatable and Jack Black, Jude Law, and Kate Winslet put in solid if unspectacular comedic work here...The film also benefits from the nice contrast between England and LA...while England comes across as a cozy warm blanket, LA comes across as too bright, too hectic, too...everything--as LA usually does...Anywho...can't really say a bad word about this movie, it was humorous in spots and pleasant enough without rising above the ordinary....
B000N6TX22|5.0|I was lucky enough to see this and Pans Labyrinth on the same day, it was the best day I ever spent at a theater.  While it is sci-fi, its not flying cars sci-fi, it exists in a very real world that was crafted amazingly by Cuaron.  Clive Owen is fantastic.  Playing a man who is simply exhausted of life from his clothes to the look of hopelessness that is present on his face, he finds something to truly believe in again with the task of safeguarding the only woman to be pregnant in more that a decade.  Julianne Moore also is great in her role.  The two of them for their interactions just seem so natural, its just fun to watch them perform.  The amount of work that went into shooting this film must have been HUGE.  Some scenes go for 10 minutes without a single cut.  This is what I want from my scifi, dont get me wrong I love light sabers and space fights as well, but this was a very strong film with fantastic themes and overall production.  Overlooked by many, appreciated by many more.

B000MNP2KI|4.0|Yeah, I know what some of you are saying about the timeline of the James Bond saga.  But, I suppose that they want people to see every James Bond film as it's own unique project and not a series of stories that you would think that should play end to end.  Casino Royale is supposed to be the story that started it all.  All us original James Bond fans think of James Bond being about 40-ish back in 1962, so if that were the case, and if all these stories were to play end to end, shouldn't the Pierce Brosnan Bond be someone in his mid-80's?  Where's the appeal in that?  No, I believe every James Bond story is designed to be of the modern day of today.  The only thing that seems to link all the Bond films together is that we know James Bond married once, and she was then murdered.  This crucial part of the James Bond saga was done in a James Bond film by a guy who only did one Bond film, George Lazenby, in On Her Majesty's Secret Service. And in the beginning of For Your Eyes Only, you see James Bond (Roger Moore) in 1981 visiting his wife's grave (and the date of her birth and death is on the tombstone).<br /><br />Yes, having Judi Dench as \\"M\\" for the first time James Bond becomes licensed to kill does seem a little awkward when other Bond film's exist with her as \\"M\\".  Then in \\"Golden Eye\\", we have her describing herself as the new \\"M\\" meeting the \\"already employed\\" James Bond (with a long tracklist of past assignments in his file), and \\"Q\\" already established in the James Bond timeline as well.  But, we're not supposed to link these things together.  We're suppose to enjoy these stories as individual stories and not focus on a timeline.  So, yes it would be difficult to try and watch these stories in a probable fabricated order.  Like watching \\"Casino Royale\\" first, and then try \\"Dr. No\\" as the next story.  It doesn't work, does it?  James Bond has a 40 plus year history, however, he never ages, does he?  He's always about 40 to 45 years old.  But, who cares?<br /><br />And to close, in my opinion, I though Pierce Brosnan's \\"Die Another Day\\" was an excellent James Bond film.  I liked it better than \\"Golden Eye\\" which was once my first favorite Pierce Brosnan Bond film.  But, like most people, I think Sean Connery will always represent the perfect James Bond.  Perhaps because he was the first.  Roger Moore was a bit stiff and boorish to me compared to Connery.  But, the Roger Moore/James Bond era had some excellent stories for the James Bond saga.<br /><br />What was starting to bother me about some James Bond films, was that they were starting to get well-known established actresses to play the women that become Bond girls.  I like the Bond films better when they use some unknown beauty from other countries to represent the new Bond girl.  That gives the story a more personal charm when it may be the only film you will see of that particular actress.<br /><br />The James Bond saga may go on for another 40 years, and James Bond will never age.  He will just continue to look different when a new actor is needed to keep the James Bond saga alive.  Who knows, we might see a black James Bond someday, and in this \\"honest opinion condemning\\" politically correct world, we're not supposed to have anything negative to say about it.

0060589469|5.0|This book can be a life changing event ,a literary bombshell, or a mild bore. Trying to get at the very essence of what life is, and what being alive is, a man and his son travel across the countryside on a motorcycle. The man trying to teach his malcontent son to live life in the moment. Ultimately they do work through thier problems, but still something remains unresolved. The lessons in this book are many but ultimately it, the book, questions wether quality is real or imagined. Trying to break down to get at the quality by reduction of the smaller and smaller theory ,you soon run out of smaller parts ,and may be left thinking ok where was the quality. The point being, that the quality of something is all of the big and small parts, and the space inbetween.  In todays world of, empty products with no paticular specialness, this book may mean more now than ever. Pirsig, I think was getting at the fact that the farther you dig into something, the deeper you go, the less you find, its only what you make of it in your own mind, ultimately its much ado about nothing.

B000O178BY|5.0|With Year Zero, Trent Reznor has finally stepped out of his own shadow. He became popular by describing turbulent emotions, mostly directed at a woman or a deity, and he portrayed these emotions through aggressive vocal performances and ear-splitting industrial music. In so doing, he typecast himself as an angry teenager, forever screaming about love, sex and betrayal and always focused on himself. Listening to Year Zero, it's difficult to believe that it was made by that same man. <br /> <br />This album has a strong sense of purpose, which hadn't been true of Nine Inch Nails albums in a while. For example, Reznor's 2005 comeback With Teeth sounded pretty good, but for the most part it felt like it wasn't about anything. Trent was railing against \\"them\\" as usual, but it felt like \\"they\\" were just some safe, vague fictional entity that Trent wrote about just because he needed to write an aggressive song. Trent even seemed to acknowledge this by adopting a light-hearted tone in a few songs. <br /> <br />Year Zero is even more deliberately focused on a fictional entity, but it feels much more real. The subject matter is informed by Reznor's political opinions, which he had started to express more frequently around the time With Teeth came out. But for the most part, the lyrics refer to current events only obliquely. Trent stated that he didn't want to come across as preaching, and so he came up with an elaborate alternate timeline, and the album is supposed to describe events that occur years into the future. This concept actually plays on one of NIN's great strengths, the ability to use simple allegorical images and persons to describe emotions (cf. \\"Head Like A Hole,\\" \\"Terrible Lie\\"). It also gave rise to Year Zero's brilliant marketing campaign, oriented around a series of extremely creepy websites. <br /> <br />Trent's lyrics still use some images that he came up with in 1989. Fans will immediately recognize such lines as \\"on hands and knees we crawl,\\" \\"found ourselves believing your lies,\\" \\"I let you put it in my mouth, I let it get under my skin,\\" \\"bow down in position,\\" \\"breathe us in slowly,\\" \\"our mother nature is a whore,\\" and so on. I have to say that this is a bit of a letdown -- I feel he could have done more, for instance if he had incorporated some of the disturbing writing from those websites (e.g. \\"Hollywood In Memoriam\\") into the album. Nonetheless, he does display greater lyrical inventiveness at times, and he makes full use of another of NIN's great strengths, the ability to write lyrics in very catchy rhythmic form (cf. \\"Sin,\\" \\"Closer\\"). <br /> <br />But the lyrics aren't really the heart of the album. This is already a departure for NIN, whose focus was always on Trent's vocals and persona first, and the music second. The music and lyrics of Year Zero are better integrated. Reznor always liked to jump between really soft and really loud, but here the abrasive and quiet parts blend together more. The album's most \\"traditional\\" NIN moment is in the chorus of \\"My Violent Heart,\\" with yelling and clanging straight from The Downward Spiral. Other than that, Year Zero is very restrained. Trent does almost no screaming. In fact, his vocal performances are more varied and subtle than ever before. He uses his concept to portray different characters (like the smug voice in \\"Capital G\\") or act as a narrator. <br /> <br />The music is much more electronic than on With Teeth, which was basically a hard rock album (complete with Dave Grohl). The rhythms sound overtly mechanical, often danceable (\\"The Beginning Of The End\\"). They have a harsh hissing production, but they're not really heavy. The closest point of comparison might be Massive Attack circa 1998. In fact, the drum breakdown at the end of \\"The Great Destroyer\\" is almost identical to the one in \\"Dissolved Girl\\" on Mezzanine. The echoing drums and pulsing bass in \\"Me, I'm Not\\" recall \\"Angel.\\" <br /> <br />The second main influence that I can see is post-punk (alsopresent in Mezzanine-era Massive Attack). In particular, \\"The Warning\\" has the best bass line that Peter Hook never played. It's very much in his style, stern and hypnotic. Other tracks like \\"The Good Soldier\\" and \\"The Beginning Of The End\\" also use droning post-punk bass lines. But toward the end of Year Zero, the music becomes more amorphous. \\"God Given,\\" \\"Meet Your Master\\" and \\"The Greater Good\\" segue seamlessly into one another, even though they're not much alike. \\"The Greater Good\\" and \\"Another Version Of The Truth\\" are moody dark-ambient pieces. Other songs have extended outros full of static and noise (which allegedly translate to images on a spectrogram), or sudden bursts of guitar. <br /> <br />Because of its thematic unity, the album has few obvious singles. \\"Survivalism\\" is actually one of the weaker songs. It has one of the more \\"typical\\" NIN choruses on the album and there is no distinguishing beat or riff. Songs like \\"Capital G,\\" \\"The Beginning Of The End\\" or \\"The Good Soldier\\" could be strong singles, but their tone seems almost too serious for radio. <br /> <br />But that tone is precisely why Year Zero is so effective. Reznor is deadly serious here, and no other popular musician could ever make a more convincing prophet of doom. It's worth buying the album just to hear the way he intones \\"Your time is tick tick ticking away\\" at the end of \\"The Warning.\\" Many songs create a disconcerting atmosphere, like \\"Vessel,\\" where the verses are set to a really strange stop-start razor-synth riff, and the chorus is the doom-laden chant, \\"My god, I don't think I can last here.\\" It is a powerful mood piece, and this is actually what makes it genuinely topical -- even if you don't pay attention to the lyrics or the dystopian concept, the album's sense of unease and uncertainty, the feeling of impending disaster, can resonate.
0743496728|5.0|My heart broke several times throughout this book. Whenever there is a tragedy such as the shootings at Columbine, henious acts committed by young people, my heart has always gone out to the mothers/parents of the perpetrator(s).  What pain to know that your son or daughter is cable of such an atrocity. How would it feel to be a mother to a murderer? I can't imagine anything worse. The remorse for moments when you should have noticed something, the guilt for failing your child somehow, and that is just one aspect of this novel. The perpetrator, Peter, a junior in high school has been himself a lifetime victim of social abuse by his peers  and his own older brother, the favored son, who gets killed in an accident one year prior to Peter's 19-minute-massacre at his school. The parents are good people, they love Peter but are grieving and unaware of his needs.  One wonders if this happens much too frequently in homes today.<br /><br />Ms. Picoult did an excellent job with this novel, allowing us readers to experience the emotions of all those involved in this sad and tragic experience.  As much as I love to read her books, this one I was glad to finish, her writing just puts you painfully \\"right there.\\"<br /><br />Bullying happens in our schools much more often than we realize and something needs to be done about it, and for some kids the effects of it never go away.  What happened to fictional Peter does not seem far-fetched.  Young people should be made aware of how hurtful their words and actions can be and what can happen as a consequence.  The ending had a twist, as Picoult often includes, and as usual Jodi did a wonderful writing job, with such a realistically cruel subject matter.
B00005JPKE|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Letters From Iwo Jima\\", from the standpoint of a well-crafted movie with excellent acting performances and casting, brilliantly subdued cinematography, and a haunting musical score. In all respects, this is a thoughtful and engrossing movie, and imbued with an ever-present melancholy about soldiers committed to an island battle that they knew would be their last.<br /><br />My only dissatisfaction with \\"Letters\\", as a student of military history and WWII in particular, was the decision to downplay the legendary ferocity of the 6 week conflict in favor of \\"behind-the-scenes\\" portrayals of the Japanese soldier's inner conflicts and longings for better times. I appreciate Eastwood's attempt to remind us that all human beings share similar longings for home, for family, and for peace- especially during the surreal happenings of war.....but one should also remember that much of the movie's direction came from letters written by Japanese soldiers on Iwo Jima during the conflict, unearthed many years later. All soldier's letters, from the beginning of time, reveal the common threads of humanity in Americans, Japanese, Germans, whatever....but they also rarely dwell on the brutal and harrowing realities of the conflict at hand.<br /><br />All the histories of Iwo Jima that I have read, including many with eye-witness accounts of the struggle, are replete with images of the ferocity of the struggle, and the tenacity of the Japanese defenders, as well as the unbelievable acts of individual heroism on both sides. 20,000 Japanese were sent to Iwo to defend it to the last- somewhere in the neighborhood of 1,000 or less survived. Most of the rest died fighting.<br /><br />My only complaint with \\"Letters\\" was that it gave little sense for the struggle itself. It portrays the defense of Mount Suribachi as almost a walk in the park for the Marines- though eye witness accounts are rather different- the top of the mountain was fairly secure by the time the Marines reached the summit for the famous flag raising(s), but the several days before that were ones of round-the-clock desperate fighting at the base of the mountain. Many Marine accounts recall those several days as the worst fighting they experienced in the whole Pacific theatre. The movie gives almost no sense of that.<br /><br />Likewise, after Suribachi fell, the struggle went on for almost 6 more weeks, filled with desperate cave-by-cave fighting, with the Japanese resisting to the end. Yes, there were many ritual suicides documented by the Marines(especially in the caves of Suribachi), but the rest of the island was a two-way death struggle that ultimately took 7,000 American lives. \\"Letters\\" dwells a bit too much on the \\"quiet moments\\" underground- my impression from reading the histories is that those moments were precious few. The movie does honor the humanity of the individual Japanese soldier, but I think it also sells the Japanese soldier's tenacity and bravery quite short.<br /><br />The letters that were recovered do tell a story, but only a small part.<br /><br />The letters that were never written tell a story too. Most of the 20,000 Japanese soldiers on Iwo were too busy to write.Marines reached the summit for the famous flag raising(s), but the several days before that were ones of round-the-clock desperate fighting at the base of the mountain.

0767819446|3.0|Skewed reality, or is it schizophrenia? <br />The line between the real & the imagined is criss-crossed & blurred countless times in this well-acted sci-fi movie.  It's interesting, fun, and quirky....but with Vincent D'Onofrio in it, could it be anything else?!
1400064287|5.0|As a left-brain-dominant person in a marketing culture that's logic-driven, data-driven and product-driven, this was an refreshing reminder that ideas don't stick because of superior logic, better data, or a longer list of facts. <br /> <br />Heath and Heath expose both the traps and best practices for generating and communicating ideas in ways that are both impactful and memorable.  <br /> <br />I read this book a week before a sales team training that focused on developing more persuasive presentations, and found the principles and ideas in the book extraordinarily helpful as we went through an exercise aimed at creating communications strategies for six client meeting / presentation / proposal scenarios. <br /> <br />You won't be surprised by the principles when you read in the book. But you can't help but apply them when you sit down to write a persuasive article, plan a presentation, or think about a marketing communications strategy. You don't read the book to learn the principles, you read the book so that it's impossible for you *not* to put them to work into practice.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to left-brained thinkers who want to improve the stickiness of their ideas and the effectiveness of their communications.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|This album is one of those albums that resides in a very special place for me. It has consistently well produced tracks, mood and 'quality'. It really could be thought of as one epic tale/song; a myth long forgotten. It's like glacier exposing the soul of the Earth after the collapse of human civilization. With time, you come to appreciate the brilliant sonic subtleties: the  textures, the changing tempo, the instrumentation. Sheer brilliance!
B000N4SHPS|4.0|I was all set to dislike this film.  I skipped the last Rocky installment, the last one I saw being when he fought the big Russian in Rocky does Glasnost. <br /> <br />However, Stallone imbues his aging South Philly boxer with such a sweet nature, weathered by his boxing years and now grieving for his departed Adrian, living a humble life in the old neighborhood, proprietor of a modest but decent family restaurant, obviously still beloved despite the fact that his championship glory days nonetheless inevitably are fading, that I was reminded why a huge audience was captivated by this character o-so-many years ago. <br /> <br />And so Stallone hooked me in for one final inspirational saga of an aging champ trying to find meaning for his life, at the same time trying to convey a message of passion and courage to his own son and a young single mother and her son.  Of course it's incredible, but realism was never the attraction of Rocky movies.  It's always been about the inspiration and the yearning. <br /> <br />So if you're beyond being touched by a sentimental flick about an iconic American character, give this a pass.  Stallone was wise not to make his opponent a villainous \\"bad\\" guy.  And that is indicative of the movie as a whole: Stallone displays maturity in both his story, himself, and his character.  He's aged gracefully, and so has Rocky, and both have their hearts in the right place in this one.  Nicely done.
B000J3OTSM|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. I finally got to see Channing Tatum show his true talent. Jenna is also awsome in this. Every film that I've seen her in she never fails to deliver a good performance. This movie touches on a group of kids from different sides of the track, but are brought together by common bonds, music and dance. I also enjoy the bonus features of this movie, videos and submission tapes.
B00001OH7V|5.0|Bowie's second instalment in the Berlin trilogy is a criminally underrated masterpiece, brimming with invention and vigour.    'Low' was most certainly an amazing achievement and an absolute treat to listen to, but unlike most, I feel that \\"Heroes\\" tops it in every regard.    The first side (like 'Low', containing the more conventional songs) has more urgency than the tracks on 'Low'. There is more energy and more depth to the song writing. Where 'Low' was fragments/ideas with magnificent textural framing, Heroes' first side shows really intricate song writing being beautifully combined with dense and innovative arrangements that take the clunky synth and electronic sounds of 'Low' and fuse them into a more sophisticated whole.    The lyrics are also much more intriguing. 'Low' was lyrically and vocally quite sparse, but on \\"Heroes\\", Bowie delivers some of his most compelling lyrics. Just couple of the fantastic snippets that pop up include:    'Your lips cut a smile on your face'    'There's slaughter in the air  Protest on the wind  Someone else inside me  Someone could get skinned'    'Sons of the silent age... Don't walk, they just glide in and out of life  They never die, they just go to sleep one day'    And of course we all know the gorgeous lyrics that the title track possesses. Not to mention Bowie's ultimate vocal performance on this track. In fact, the vocals on the \\"Heroes\\" album soar like on no other release of his. The songs climax and Bowie belts out some amazingly expressive and emotive performances. Overall, the first half of the record takes the best parts of `Low's' first half and 'Station to Station' and turns it into the most successful and engaging group of tracks that he has ever released.       The second half of the album sees Bowie reprising the ambient themes explored on 'Low' but once again this album outdoes its predecessor. The instrumental tracks on \\"Heroes\\" are even more evocative than those on 'Low'. Bowie and Eno once again strip away the clunky synth and electronic sounds and create more focused and more atmospheric pieces second time around.    Bowie feels like more of a presence on this album overall. Less detached, and not hiding away from himself as much. This is further displayed by the re-introduction of his sax playing on a number of tracks. He adds personality and flair to 'Sons of the Silent Age', provides one of many gorgeous melodic layers on 'V-2 Schneider' (which trumps both 'The Speed of Life' and 'A New Career In A New Town'), and his free-jazz styled, heavily treated playing on 'Neukoln' is oddly appealing. Bowie also plays the Japanese Koto on 'Moss Garden' giving a beautifully subtle and sensitive performance on what is a perfect ambient piece.    If you own 'Low', love it, and are wondering which album to get next... well I can't recommend \\"Heroes\\" highly enough. If you own 'Station to Station' and love it... ditto. If you have some of Bowie's other albums from some of his other periods and are curious about which of the more experimental albums to start with, this is the one. It's one of those albums that is experimental without compromising quality song writing. It takes the ideas first generated on 'Low' and expands and improves upon them, while introducing a highly unique and infinitely appealing aesthetic all of its own. It is also more timeless than 'Low'. It's sounds are still fresh and haven't dated a bit in the 30 years since its release.     It is not only the best of the Bowie and Eno collaborations (The Berlin Trilogy), it is also, in my opinion, the greatest achievement by this most amazing artist.
B000MG1YC0|5.0|I love gothic metal. It is the only type of metal music I will listen to. Unfortunately a lot of gothic metal music nowadays is rather generic sounding and sounds awfully like Leaves' Eyes or Nightwish. This is not the case with Sirenia. A friend recently gave me a copy of \\"Nine Destinies and a Downfall\\". This is my first Sirenia cd so I can't compare this album with past Sirenia albums. As a new listener to Sirenia's music, I immediately fell in love with this album. The album is chockful of radio friendly gothic metal tracks. The songs are extremely accessible. I immediately fell in love with the album the moment I heard \\"Last Call\\". I knew I was in for a treat. I especially love \\"My Mind's Eye\\". I find myself playing this song over and over again because of the infectious pop hooks that permeates through the entire song. One of the things that stood out for me about this album is Monika Pedersen's clean vocals. Her vocals has a hint of Liv Kristine influence but they are very subtle. The musicianship is tight and solid. There was not one single song on this album I did not like. As a new fan I am curious to check out the band's earlier albums. I am well aware that their other albums with their former vocalist is not as clean and polished as \\"Nine Destinies and a Downfall\\". I understand why some longtime fans are not happy with this album. I could say the same about some of my favorite bands.
B000KX0IOK|4.0|Another good movie about life,lessons and people. It shows that How two people from different backgrounds are drawn together and form a friendship,one that is viewed ackward,due to the fact that it is a close student and teacher relationship,but one that throughout the movie is shown to be a helpful one. The lesson taught sometimes we just need that one person in our life who doesn't give up on us, when everyone else does.

B000M4RG42|5.0|Why do we do this to our children? Our brothers? Our husbands and lovers? I'm no fan of war, to be sure; and I grew up in the military: an Army Brat. It provided security for my family when there was none to be had anywhere else - much like today.<br /><br />WWII was supposed to be the war to end all wars - so they said. They sold it then, as they sell it now; for profit. There are no heroes; there are only men, women, soldiers doing as they are told - and that should be enough to honor their lives more than we do by sending them off to die.<br /><br />The graphic battle footage reminded me very much of Saving Private Ryan only more so. More than I needed, but in cases like this I tell myself, \\"If they had to experience it, the least I could do is to bear witness.\\" From the comfort of my favorite chair, I don't feel I have the right to complain.<br /><br />Did they die for my freedom? I'm not sure what they died for. The politics of war: Freedoms are eroding all around us. The conflicting reality of the war between how it was portrayed \\"at home\\" and how it was experienced in the field is enough to make anyone crazy, I'm sure. The soldiers who survived lived those traumas for the rest of their lives - and for what?<br /><br />We have a responsibility, a duty as citizens, to pay attention. To hold our government accountable for these atrocities as they are committed each and every generation. They should not be based on a lie. They all too often are.<br /><br />This point was made powerfully by the character played by Adam Beach - a point he makes in all of his movies subtly, wisely, artfully. The stereotypes were not his - they belonged to the men around him, and he has every right to point them out, as do all of the many Native American actors doing such good work today. Adam Beach is a beautiful, talented, remarkable human being. I have followed his work since Squanto, Smoke Signals and Dance Me Outside. He is a gift to our generation.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0001I55YW Squanto: A Warrior's Tale]]:B0001I55YW Squanto: A Warrior's Tale]]
B00005BIIP|5.0|I ordered this CD from England after I had bought Lightbulb Sun, which included samples from Recordings.  Porcupine tree was so hard to find in the US then.  I am still amazed at the music when I hear it (often).  PT is perhaps the best progressive rock band in the world, and getting better.  These \\"culls\\" are better than most bands will ever produce.  Check out The Sky Moves Sideways and Signify, which I consider their other masterpieces.
6301640659|4.0|<br /> Cruising is an offensive thriller and that's precisely what Friedkin wanted it to be, despite the disclaimer at the beginning of the movie. I was 13 when this came out.  I remember it was the talk of the town for a few weeks before disappearing from theaters. Some of the scenes are so vile and make one's stomach turn. In 1980 homosexuality was not quite as accepted as it it today, and it was pretty much okay to call yourself a \\"homophobe.\\"  This movie played on those fears that people had- and some still have. While it's undeniable that this type of underworld existed- and I'm sure still exists- I think the movie implied that this is how most gay men probably live.  <br />I do agree with an earlier reviewer who said that the movie gets more interesting after watching it several times.  By the way, did you notice who plays one of the police detectives?? it's that guy from \\"Married With Children.\\" <br />
B000FS9FCQ|1.0|V for Vendetta. It hints at George Orwell's 1984 and various other Totalitarian State movies but that is not what it is realy about. In the past a Government (read George W Bush), caused a disaster (the attack on the twin towers and the Pentagon), that was supposedly caused by international terrorists (Al-Quada), but as has already been stated it was the countries own Government (read George W Bush), that did it so that they could pass draconian laws (read anti-terror laws), and have a reason to invade other Countries (read Terrorist supporting Countries), by pretending that they were only defending themselves. This is just another looney Conspiracy theory with no evidence to support it but it attracts morons by the bus loads, the only difference with this one is that they managed to make a major movie out of such pig swill. Now look into your conscience and see how you would feel if you lost a loved one to a terrorist attack and some corporate movie conglomorate made a fortune from your loss by twisting the facts to suit an army of idiot conspiracy theorists.
B000NA1OXY|1.0|I liked her first album, thought her second album was mediocre, and really don't like this one.  It's like she took all the elements I didn't like from the first two albums and used them exclusively for this one.  I guess I'm showing my age, but the first cut, \\"Girlfriend\\" reminds me of \\"Hey Mickey\\" by Toni Basil.

B000002O51|5.0|In the late 1970s, as a result of the success of their first two albums, \\"Boston\\" established themselves as one of the premier bands in the Rock industry.  I would even go as far to say that with the momentum they achieved with their debut album \\"Boston\\" (still one of the most successful debuts in history) and \\"Don't Look Back\\", that they might become the successors in Rock's line of royalty to Led Zeppelin (following the disintegration as a result of John Bonham's death).  However, the problems that would ensue would completely derail this road for Boston.   The 1980s would see the breakdown of the original lineup of the band and legal battles that would delay any future work by the band.  By the Fall of 1986, the band found themselves in a very different position - the comeback position.  This comeback would mark the launch of Boston's third album - \\"Third Stage\\".   For fans of the band who had waited 8 years for the album, they would not be disappointed.   The band assembles a terrific concept album that doesn't miss a beat.    For the most part, I consider Boston to be the partnership of guitarist Tom Scholz and vocalist (the late) Brad Delp.   Boston had a stable lineup for their first two albums.  In addition to Scholz and Delp were Sib Hashian, bassist Fran Sheehan, and guitarist Barry Goudreau.  \\"Third Stage\\" would not include Hashian, Sheehan, or Goudreau.  This was a result of a falling out the band had in the 1980s.   Replacing Hashian on drums would be Jim Masdea (who played drums prior to the debut album) and Gary Pihl would pick up the void on guitars.  However the partnership of Scholz and Delp was good enough to keep the Boston sound going.   While Scholz often gets most of the creative credit for Boston, I really feel it is the unique vocals of Brad Delp that give Boston its edge.  I always contend you can find another Tom Scholz on guitar, but there was only one Brad Delp on vocals.   It was no surprise that \\"Third Stage\\"'s follow-up \\"Walk On\\" failed because Delp wasn't on that album.   It is no surprise that Boston's career is currently in limbo (at the time of this writing) due to Delp's untimely death.    The nice thing about \\"Third Stage\\" is that it does integrate a loose concept theme around most of the tracks.   It uses an analogy of the setting sail on a spaceship to someone maturing by reaching thirtysomething in age.  The album reflects the maturity that a man hits when he reaches his 30s.   While not all of the songs use the spaceship theme, the songs in one form or another reflect this maturity in age.  It's not just the songwriting that is good,  the musicianship of the band and powerful vocals of Brad Delp really are in top form.    One important note to make is that most of these songs were written in the early 1980s.  The amazing thing is that Boston did not use synthesizers for this album.   This is amazing for two reasons: 1) Even though it sounds like there is a synthesizer component, there isn't (Organs, pianos, and the Hammond G-5 help to fill the gap left by the synthesizer); 2) The idea of abandoning the synthesizer was more of a late 1980s trend (i.e. 1987 onward), yet Boston conceptualized most of \\"Third Stage\\" in the early 1980s.   One must give Boston some points in creative and innovative thinking in the music industry for going with this trend early.    The Spaceship concept occurs on tracks 2 through 8.   On track 2, \\"We're Ready\\" the spaceship might be getting ready to launch, but Boston actually is talking about one taking the next step in a relationship.  Track 3 is an instrumental called the \\"The Launch\\" - it is divided into 3 parts (Countdown, Ignition, and Third Stage Separation). The music does sound like a spaceship launching.  Once launched, on track 4, the spaceship will \\"Cool the Engines\\", but this is referring to calming down from one's younger days.  On track 5, the spaceship arrives at \\"My Destination\\".  \\"My Destination\\" might be the most powerful track on the collection.  Most people are familiar with the radio-friendly power-ballad, \\"Amanda\\" - which is the first track on the album.  \\"My Destination\\" is a different spin on \\"Amanda\\" - and overall I find it a better song.  Delp's vocals are even stronger than \\"Amanda\\".  This song deals with arriving at \\"my destination ... by your side\\" in a relationship.  This again reflects maturity.    Tracks 6, 7, and 8 continue the spaceship theme.  \\"A New World\\" is a very short instrumental, but refers to exploring the new world that the spaceship set sail to.  Perhaps this is also the maturity of one in life.  On Track 7, \\"To Be a Man\\", the person who set sail now must prove he is a man in his new world.  This can also be reflected to everyday life as well.  Finally track 8, \\"I Think I Like It\\", refers to the person enjoying the new world he set sail to, but also reflective of liking the changes in his life.    While Track 9 \\"Can'tcha Say\\"doesn't fit into this theme of setting sail on a spaceship, it might be the best track.  It consists of two tracks - the powerful, hard-rocking, \\"Can'tcha Say\\" with a segue to the powerful power-ballad \\"Still in Love\\".  The titles of these songs describe what these songs are about.  Fusing these songs together really works.  This \\"double track\\" is my favorite track on any Boston album.  Delp's amazing vocals contribute to the power of this track.  There is also the tenth track, \\"Hollyann\\" - this is a nice track as well.    The liner notes contain not only the lyrics, but notes on each track and notes on the making of the album.  This is a great album - not a bad track in the whole lot.  Highly recommended.

0738206679|5.0|Networks all have a meaningful similarity. Whether the network at hand is a party, a cell's molecular reaction, or the puzzling old bridges of K&ouml;nigsberg, Prussia, you could describe each one by using a branch of mathematics called \\"graph theory,\\" invented by Leonhard Euler in 1736. His long-dormant concept bloomed in the 1990s with the advent of the Internet and continues to yield insights into many important problems. Sounds a bit dry? Don't worry. Albert-L&aacute;szl&oacute; Barab&aacute;si writes in a lively style (there's nary an equation in sight) with fun, informative anecdotes. The tale of how he and other scientists discovered \\"the laws of networks\\" unfolds like a detective story. After reading this book, you'll see networks everywhere and gain deeper insight into disparate phenomena, from biological systems to business organizations to the economics of \\"increasing returns.\\" We recommend this clear, accessible book to anyone who has ever wondered about the ubiquitous webs that encompass all things.

B000M341QE|5.0|The Departed puts a new twist on classic cop/gangster movies (think Scarface, Goodfellas, Carlito's Way & LA Confidential) with an all star cast (Matt Damon, Jack, de Caprio, and a Baldwin in a role you don't hate him for).  The Irish mob has a mole in the state police, and the police have a mole in the mob.  Who finds who first?  How are their positions mirrors of each other, and how are they divergent? <br /> <br />The name of the movie comes from a preoccupation with death.  Death of family, death of characters (guess what, some die!) and death as motivation.  This theme is one of the unique spots of the movie.   <br /> <br />The move also has the breakout role of Mark Wahlberg.  Despite having seen Invincible the night before, this viewer didn't reaize he was in the movie until after.  He disappeared THAT much into his role.  In a sense it was a subtle show stealer - and he showed himself an elite actor on the level (above the level?) of the other stars. <br /> <br />More than just a gangster/cop flick, this joins the gallery of the great gangster/cop flicks.
0385333846|5.0|No author's passing has ever affected me as profoundly as that of Kurt Vonnegut (1922-2007). Slaughterhouse Five is the most beautifully written and meaningful anti-war book I have ever experienced. I write \\"experienced\\" because this is a book you experience rather than just read.  I have re-experienced the book several times since first picking it up in high school, and its powerful ideas are more compelling and moving every time. Vonnegut's message about the horror and futility of war is so stirring because of the gentle sincerity and quiet simplicity with which he conveys it. Sadly, it seems the world has been in a constant state of violence and conflict in one region or another since Vonnegut wrote his book so many decades ago. We need to re-experience his message now more than ever.<br /><br />Thank you Mr. Vonnegut, and may you finally rest in peace.

I am recommending FlyLady's ideas to all I meet.   <br /> <br />If you have tried everything and feel overwhelmed, give it a try.  What do you have to lose?
B000MV8AE0|4.0|The best thing going for this movie is Ed Harris' electrifying performance as Beethoven.  He captures Beethoven's musical genius and his dark side, as a rude and crude man.      Other reviewers have done an excellent job of describing the story. What I want to comment on is the masterful job done by the screenwriters and the performers of capturing the compositional genius of Beethoven.    What I really liked about the movie:      1) The scenes of Beethoven composing his music    The transformation of Beethoven's egomania to one of thanksgiving:  Initially, Beethoven was mad at God for giving him a musical gift and then making him deaf. He would purposedly make statements about God that border on blasphemy.  Those statements showed his frustration at God for allowing him to become deaf so he could no longer listen to his compositions but had to rely on a earpiece or on vibrations.  Later on, as the film progresses, Beethoven discovers how God speaks to him through music and he makes his peace with God through composing a hymn of thanksgiving towards the end of his life.  His dialogue to Anna about how he can sense the voice of God through music were very moving.     The scenes of Beethoven composing are the most memorable scenes in this movie for me -- he clearly has the great gift of being able to piece together all the musical forms in his head.  These scenes reminded me of \\"Amadeus\\" when Mozart was able to see how all the different parts of different instruments come together in his symphonic compositions.     Through these scenes we get to see how God chose to deposit his musical gifts in a very common and ordinary man who is full of shortcomings and weaknesses.      2) Ed Harris does a great job of capturing the divergent natures of Beethoven -- on one hand he is a musical genius, but on the other hand, he is quite a brute of a man.  On one hand, he could be gentle and tender, but on the other, he could suddenly become \\"The BEAST\\" -- be extremely cruel and harsh in his ridicule and mockery.  While Beethoven is busy composing a new musical work,  he could also be pouring water on his disheveled hair and drive his neighbors crazy with his utter disregard for their well-being as he ruins their dinner times.     3) The wonderful music in the film:  Not only do we get to hear the wonderful movements of the 9th Symphony, but we get to hear excerpts of the String Quartet and other works.  The movie could have done without \\"Fur Elise\\" (which is overplayed to death) -- we could have had more of some of his sonatas and chamber works.      4) The wonderful featurette \\"Orchestrating Beethoven\\" which offered great interviews of the director, script writers, and cast members.  It was very insightful.  The featurette and deleted scenes are great.     What I didn't like about the movie:    1) The over-emphasis on the importance of Anna Holtz to Beethoven.  Other reviewers have rightly criticized the movie as having too much of a feminist bent in this story of Beethoven.  As the featurette in the Special Features explain, the story of Anna Holtz as the gifted female compositional student is a work of fiction -- Anna Holtz is an example of artistic license on the part of screenwriters;  she is a composite of all the different assistants that helped Beethoven.    For dramatic effect and for creating a strong female character, the screenwriters created Anna Holtz to be the one assistant that comes to the aid of Beethoven in both his personal life and his compositional & musical efforts.  As Diane Kruger portrays her, Anna is attractive, intelligent, gifted, and perceptive.  She is everything that Schlemmer (Beethoven's aging male assistant) is not.  She is able to discern the thoughts and feelings of Beethoven -- she is the perfect assistant to help complete and \\"correct\\" Beethoven's compositions. At the climactic close, she is perfectly in sync with Beethoven as he conducts the 9th Symphony.  She is able to conduct just as Beethoven does.In fact they become \\"one\\" in their conducting.      Historical and musical purists may be infuriated at these scenes.     2) It is highly doubtful that Beethoven conducted the 9th symphony with the help of a female assistant giving him the rhythmic cues.  Yet, this forms the climax of the movie.      All this aside, I felt that the movie was very worthwhile to watch.  It was a very moving and inspirational portrait of Beethoven.  In fact, I think it is the best portrayal of Beethoven for a feature film.  It is a much better film on Beethoven than \\"Immortal Beloved\\" (which I think was very chaotic and unorganized).    If you're a classical music lover and a Beethoven fan, this movie is well-worth watching.  I believe you'll be impressed by Harris' acting.
B00005JPCF|2.0|I was excited about this one coming out.  I love the cast, great actors.  It is very slow to start and is kinda mind-numbing!  Starts to get better once Robin Williams' character comes in because before that there is not even an attempt at a laugh.  Not much in the form of a villian either.  Not thrilled by the choice of music, not the normal great selection as with other cartoon favorites!  I did however like the integregration of live action with the rest of the animation without looking roger rabbity about it.  Overall a snoozer and not worth the time.  Rent, don't buy!!
B0002RQ2T4|2.0|Bluntly said Ghost in the Shell is ok. It's not spectacular. The premisis is normal for cyberpunk, the art is brilliant at times horrible at others, the voices are ok but far too quiet, and the nudity felt too tacked on and there was much too much of it. You should check out Stand alone complex before you resort to this. BTW for a special edition they don't put that much special stuff in, and the packaging is horribly annoying and impossible to handle.
B00027JYLC|5.0|This is really a one of a kind movie. Creepy atmosphere abounds in this carnival freak show setting, the use of real \\"Freaks\\" adds greatly to this bizarre tale of revenge. The DVD transfer is very good and a worthy purchase.
B0006A9FMI|3.0|That being said, GITSI is ok......Again. It is far better than the first film. THe nudity is far less annoying and prominent (simply because Motoko isn't present) and i think it's better that we get to explore the character of Bateu. It's an ok film, but the fact there is no english voices will infuriate some, and the subtitles have captions (if you don't know what captions are you probably don't want to know.)
B0000524CY|5.0|OK This is not only one of the scariest movies ever made, it's also one of the best! As much as I love the spider walk segment, I prefer the original theatrical version of the movie way more than this version. This movie is scary as HELL and needs no embellishments! Please release the original version re-mastered on DVD! If you haven't seen this film and call yourself a Horror film fan, you haven't seen one of the few truly scary films in the history of film making. Try this one late night by yourself with the lights out with no one in the house! If the hair on the back of your neck isn't standing I don't know what will get a raise out of you!
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|This was, by far, my favourite movie of 2006.  I saw it three times at the cinema, and borrowed the (single-disc edition) DVD, watching it twice more, before buying this two-disc edition.  The movie is great. <br /> <br />The first disc of this edition is the same as the single-disc edition.  It includes a \\"Making of\\" featurette; it does not include any commentary.  The second disc has about half a dozen other features, none of them particularly long, or memorable.  Most, if not all, could have fit on the single DVD. <br /> <br />I recommend the movie.  This two-disc edition is not much more expensive than the single disc but, even at that, it's hardly worth the extra money.
B000NDEZPA|5.0|I would actually give \\"The Story\\" 4 and a half stars...Brandi and the twins haven't released their masterpiece YET, but based on this \\"story\\", it will happen sooner than we think.<br /><br />This simply is a great record, with lots of layers, variety, emotion, power, subtlety, all in a great alt-country/roots-rock/folk sound, and well-written lyrics.  Thing is, these songs were written scatteredly over the course of many years, with Brandi testing her mettle as a singer-songwriter.  Looks like the great T-Bone Burnett, who produced this work, went over Brandi's (and the twins') stash of songs and picked out the best 13 (14 if you include the evocative final unlisted track), and sequenced them the best way possible.<br /><br />Simply, the album flows like a well-written novel, with chapters and a beginning, middle and end.  It's a nice evolution from her fine, self-titled 2005 debut.<br /><br />There are tons of highlights, like my fave, the rocking \\"My Song\\", the mood-shifting title track, the organ-flowing and megamelodic \\"Losing Heart\\", the plaintive and moving \\"Cannonball\\" (featuring The Indigo Girls, who add beautiful harmonies to Brandi's malleable voice...like Lucinda Williams, Kathleen Edwards, Anne McCue, even like a grittier k.d.lang or an American KT Tunstall...and you can tell the girls were impressed with Brandi's song)...everytime you pop on \\"The Story\\", you will come up with a new favourite.  I like this limited-edition packaging too, just like a mysterious book.<br /><br />What struck me first about \\"The Story\\" was I saw the album first ON VINYL baby!!!  The packaging fits the vinyl format like a glove, and it's a 2-record set...instant collector's item the way Brandi's career will take off.  Then I saw T-Bone produced, then I saw Brandi's & the twins' Leno performance of the title track, and I was blown away.<br /><br />This record will make an impression on you, guaranteed...it's one of the finest of 2007, and will make MANY best-of lists, you'll see.  People will be talking about \\"The Story\\" at year's end, it just might get a Grammy nod as well...I'm just shocked that Lucinda Williams hasn't been spreading the word, like \\"Brandi's my new fave artist\\", like she did Kasey Chambers.<br /><br />I liked Brandi on her debut...now I love her on \\"The Story\\"...<br /><br />VERY impressive record...a work of art really...you'll see.  People will be talking about \\"The Story\\" at year's end, it just might get a Grammy nod as well...I'm just shocked that Lucinda Williams hasn't been spreading the word, like \\"Brandi's my new fave artist\\", like she did Kasey Chambers. <br /> <br />I liked Brandi on her debut...now I love her on \\"The Story\\"... <br /> <br />VERY impressive record...a work of art really...
B00004RFFI|4.0|OK, digital special effects have come a long way in the last decade, but this movie still comes across really well.  I remember being surprised (when first I saw it) by the quality of the story, and the acting, and those also stand up on review.  I mention this because there've been a lot of movies that I remembered as being good that have not stood up to the test of time.  Three of the four leads are at least as good as I remembered, and Jami Gertz's performance is even better. <br /> <br />The DVD includes a commentary by director Jan deBont (who used to be a cinematographer) and the special effects supervisor.  It added to my appreciation of the film, but focuses (ouch) almost exclusively on visual aspects of the film. <br /> <br />I didn't notice it in the product description but, this edition comes in a snap case, less durable than an all-plastic keep case.
0743496728|3.0|As a fan of Picoult`s work, I admit to being a bit disappointed in this book. The book starts off with an interesting premise: How does a community deal with the aftermath of a Columbine-style school shooting? The adult characters, particularly Judge Cormier and the detective are well-developed and make the story interesting. <br /> <br />However, the high school characters were disappointingly shallow and stereotypical. The jocks and pretty girls make up the popular, overly cruel group. The shooter, a geeky and sensitive computer nerd, is constantly harassed. While there is some truth to the stereotypes, real life is never so cut-and-dry. The book loses its realism by following these character clichés so closely - it begins to feel more like a B-list teen angst movie. <br /> <br />The twist at the end was interesting, but very unrealistic. A twist should be an \\"ah-ha!\\" moment, but instead I was left wondering how it fit with the story. Overall, the book was a quick and interesting read that was a little disappointing in character-development.
0394800389|1.0|My wife bought this for our daughter for christmas several years back and frankly it is a terrible book. This coming from a huge fan of Dr. Seuss. It basically has no story or interesting plot at all. The purpose of the book is just to have a bunch of tongue twisters just to have them there. I really was surprised how bad this book was since I love so many other Dr. Seuss books (our child has at least 15 other seuss books we love). Honestly, my child picks this book periodically for bed time stories, and my wife and i will cringe when reading this. Also, our child doesn't really seem to care for it either.
B000G8NY4U|4.0|This is a spectacular Concert Event DVD, with dazzling light show, and awesome video/recording tech. The eclectic group of musicians are wonderful individually and as a group, and some of them greatly outshine Yanni as musicians. Yanni shines here mainly as producer and creative catalyst. As a whole, there is not quite enough musical substance to balance out all the pizazz, but it is certainly entertaining and enjoyable.
B000N3ST8O|5.0|I have to admit, I love the CD, but the DVD is beyond awesome with so much background information about the songs & videos, the band and Stevie's life.  I, too, was a little disappointed that two of my favorites weren't on the CD, \\"Sara\\" and \\"Gypsy\\", but the DVD more than made up for it.  Stevie's commentary is amazing and informative.  I particularly enjoyed the back story on her lyrics to \\"Edge of Seventeen\\".<br /><br />If you're a Stevie Nicks fan, this is a must own for your collection from one of America's pioneering Rock and Roll Princesses.  It's great to see her alive and well and still creating her magical poetry/lyrics.
B000NA77YO|5.0|The gems here are the new 3 songs, with Shadow of the Wind being my favorite. Of coarse anything this version of sabbath did was great.I can feel my doors shake when im driving with this one! Im just thankful of this tour and they dont have bands like this around anymore except tool of course! Let hope for that Live Evil dvd maybe someday before I die guys, please?
0060566108|5.0|This book can be aptly tagged as a textbook for Leadership 101. It is a must read for every career-conscious person, at any level of organizational hierarchy. The best thing about this book is that every reader will be able to get something useful and meaningful out of it. Unlike other run-of-the-mill leadership books/material which just mention stories for motivation, this book is completely based on real concrete data. Rather it is presented in the form a thesis/dissertation after about six years of research. Before reading this book, I did believe in some of the myths which are shattered in the first chapter and then proved to be only myths. The conclusions are completely data-driven.<br /><br />Choosing a set of companies as visionary companies on the basis of their overall past performance (not just financial) and an another comparison company, authors cite the fundamental elements of a visionary company. I will not go in detail of those reasons and would recommend one to read it directly as you go through the book.<br /><br />Authors have done a great job in explaining and justifying their research and data through the appendices and bibliography. A study of all the existing companies to find the visionary ones is really a daunting task and this research team has done a terrific job in establishing a definition of a \\"visionary company\\".

0765315246|5.0|Read this book in one day during two sittings. The story was great, reminiscent of Starship Troopers. The technology described or imagined by the author made me pause many times and think how wonderful it would be to live in such a time. The most interesting tech was sharing feelings over BrainPal.
B000MGVCFO|4.0|The \\"EGBDF\\" remaster is as pleasing as the previous Moody reissues. However, there is an extra bonus track, \\"After You Came\\", listed in the booklet. This track is not listed on the outer sleeve, and is not on the CD. Otherwise this reissue would rate a 5.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|I was already a believer, and this confirmed my notions about Global Warming. I like the way Mr. Gore presents the information...reminiscent of Carl Sagan in that it brings science to laymen in terms they can understand. There is a second disk included which provides even more anecdotes and evidence in the year after the film was made.
B000OWAFPE|1.0|Remember when Mary Poppin's said \\"a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down\\"?  This movie is saying:  \\"a spoonful of cute dancing penguins helps the policital propoganda go down.\\"<br /><br />This is not a kids movie.  It is a cartoon aimed at drawing a wide audience (especially kids), in order to force feed them the directors views on morality, homosexuality, and environmentalism.<br /><br />The political undertones and overtones in this movie are so blatant and obvious it is ridiculous.<br /><br />If you want Hollywood to be your moral compass, then this movie is perfect for you, otherwise stay away.
B00000JPH4|5.0|If you care about what your kids watch, this is good enough reason.  This is an epic tale of good vs evil, but also that others, no matter how seemingly insignifigant, can help you on your way.  I saw this when I was 7, and goobled it up right away.  With all the people claiming to believe in God, teaching religion, this is nowhere near as scary.
0385340540|2.0|I expected more from Grisham, but really this book isn't all that good.  Nice character development, but no action, no drama.  Third act wraps up with little suspense.  Pass on this one...
B000ICL3KG|5.0|It is obvious that Al Gore is driven by passion in his desire to help save the Earth from his book and movie, An Inconvenient Truth. Mr. Gore personally touched me by his passion when I mailed a review copy of my book, \\"Harmonious Environment\\" to him and he responded within weeks that he would read and comment on it.  He is an extremely busy man--but he selflessly found the time to personally type me a letter because my book deals with saving the planet and that is his mission.<br /><br />Although this is an extrememly difficult subject, it is a very easy to watch movie. Mr. Gore is engaging, articulate and warm. There are lovely shots of the earth and it is beautiful for a reason--Mr. Gore wants us to love and cherish our planet the way he does. The point he makes is just that--you care for what you love.  We--the stewards of the Earth--must take care of her.<br /><br />I always prefer the book version to the movie version, but in the case of An Inconvenient Truth, I loved them both. The advantage to the book is that it contains more insight into Mr. Gore's personal life, which I found fascinating.  However, if you are a movie person, rest assured that the book and movie cover virtually the same material.<br /><br />In 1968, as an undergraduate in Harvard, Al Gore was lucky enough to study under Roger Revelle, the first person to measure CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere. Mr. Gore writes: \\"I will never forget the graph he [Revelle] drew on the blackboard or the dramatic message it conveyed: that something profoundly new was happening to the atmosphere of the entire planet and that this transformation was being caused by human beings.\\"<br /><br />The movie concludes with valuable, practical and easy ways in which we can reduce our impact on the earth. These tips are meant to empower us, because we can help stop global warming--each and every one of us.<br /><br />Watch this book now and fall in love with Earth.<br /><br />Author of award winning book, [[ASIN:0977963306 Harmonious Environment: Beautify, Detoxify and Energize Your Life, Your Home and Your Planet]]nergize Your Life, Your Home and Your Planet]]
B000N6TX1I|5.0|Children of Men is the kind of film that you really don't see that often: the kind of film that keeps surprising you. From the very beginning we are thrown into a decaying, depressed world. We learn quickly that the human race has become entirely incapable of reproducing. Although the causes are unknown for the most part, there is much speculation throughout and conspiracy theorizing.<br /><br />The film covers all aspects of the human condition and currently relevant topics as well. Immigration, discrimination, loneliness, depression, hopelessness, government control, media spin: all of these topics are given ample consideration.<br /><br />The future that Alfonso Cuaron paints here is bleak and depressing. But visually, the film is stunning. Several shots last for several minutes and cover unbelievable amounts of distance and action. At times it's hard to imagine that the camera has been rolling continuously while buildings explode and people are mowed down by machine gun fire. This helps give the movie a sense of reality that only deepens the darkness of what we see.<br /><br />All the acting is phenomenal, and Clive Owen makes a great anti-hero, as a normal guy trying to navigate the perils of terrorist groups and governmental control.<br /><br />The special features are great and include a documentary about what the film represents and a look into what we are doing to our planet through pollution and our treatment of our fellow humans. Overall, this is just a solid DVD that belongs in any collection.
0843178086|5.0|Mr Funny is the 18th book in the Mr Men series, first published in 1976. This was a colorful favorite of mine when I was little. It features Mr Funny's unusual life, and a silly trip to the zoo, which is all nicely illustrated and fascinating to follow. Worth a look.
B000002GQJ|2.0|The Moody Blues were for my generation the Powerhouse Band that fused hard rock with classical to create dreamscapes.  Their signature sound enthralled millions!<br /><br />Yet they started to slip from their pedestals, beginning with this album.<br /><br />The Song \\"Question\\" was by far one of their most powerful, beautiful and brilliant pieces ever created.  Yet the other songs and ballads on this album are, in my opinion, mediocre.<br /><br />The blues resurfaced and climbed their pedestal once again with \\"Seventh Sojurn.\\"  From then on, they have never been as creative as they were on \\"To Our Children's Children's Children.\\"<br /><br />The best way to buy this album is to get on an online MP3  service and purchase only the song: \\"Question.\\"
B000LC3ID8|3.0|Saw II is that rare horror movie that is just as good if not better than the original.  Depending on what you thought of Saw, Saw II looks to be about as demented, and makes about as much sense as Saw.<br /><br />The film opens with another hapless fool waking up in another music-video-leftover room with another insane device attached to his head.  The serial killer Jigsaw (who has never killed anyone) informs him via video that he has about a minute to cut out his eyeball to retrieve a key to unlock the venus-flytrap device on his head.  Argh!  From there we are introduced to a weary cop with family troubles who is being personally called out by Jigsaw.  Before long, we find out that Jigsaw has kidnapped his son, along with a bunch of other idiots and placed them in a booby trapped house with poison gas being pumped through the vents and a time limit for them to endure sick, twisted, horror-movie-traps and tests in order to prove how badly they want to live.<br /><br />Don't think too closely about this one, as by the end it makes even less sense than the twist of the original.  And yes, there is a twist of sorts.  The movie looks like the original, meaning it looks like a Nine Inch Nails video and has all the editing of the ADD school of filmmaking which is now apparently a pre-req for making at least 50% of movies.  The ridiculous editing is getting out of hand now---why do they feel the need to TELL you visually that it's time to get tense, or scared?  Are the filmmakers too uneasy about the material and their ability to just rely on the situation, the script, the actors?  Do I need to see crack head editing and lights and that over-produced dirt and grime in every movie in order to feel anything?<br /><br />These movies are not scary in the least, masking a lack of imagination in the horror/fear department, but plenty of imagination in the 'how else can they die' department.  Cruelty and tastelessness are the new horror genre checkpoints, I guess it's a lot easier than creating genuine scares or fear.  How about babies in a blender, that'd be a good horror flick.  These films can be demented fun for 90 minutes and can be a lot of fun in a crowded movie theater, but they're overdone and over-stylized.  The visuals don't show you as much as tell you (with the same lighting, editing, colors) that this is a horror film.  The moral 'message' of the killer, or the writers, is perhaps the real reason this is a horror film.<br /><br />Plenty of extras about the making of the film and the traps, all the work that goes into this madness, new ways to torture and kill people, and other wonders.  It's always nice to see that artistic, creative people can make a living designing torture contraptions for fictitious serial killers (fictitious today, that is), and that those serial killers become 'beloved' characters to American audiences.  There's a 2 DVD set out there as well, though this single disc unrated widescreen edition should suffice for most folks.  I would bet the house that Saw becomes a video game or a series of them, the possibilities for interactive sadism are too much for them not to hybridize Saw.<br /><br />Followed by Saw III.  And IV.

B0007MWZEK|5.0|I love my swivel sweeper! I bought the two pack for $19.99 each plus shipping and handling from the main website which I think was $14.99 total. So overall I had gotten two for around $60. This thing does every thing the company says it does even though I think it's a bit pricy. I am so pleased with it! If you want it made right,go to their website. I've had mine for 3 months and gave the other one to my parents. My dad loves it and has taken over the vacuuming for my mom! My mom loves their old vacuum but she always wanted an upright cordless, now she has one.     When I say this thing does what the company says it will this means I've tried every thing the commercial says and it lives up to the commercial's garantee. This thing even picks up:    *Cat hair  *Kitty litter  *Kitty food (my cats are messy eaters)  *Small pieces of paper  *String (although if it's too long it'll bind up in the gears. It'll switch off automatically at a certain point. Then all you do is pull out the string then turn it on and keep on going.  *Dirt/Dust Bunnies (duh)  *Some different types of cereals (cheerios), etc.  *Food crumbs    You need to clean out the compartment after every two or three rooms because the only downside is it's a small compartment to hold the crap it collects. But it's easy to dump out and snap together and keep on going! My house is 1,000 sq foot so I can wait till I'm done with 90% of the house then clean out the tray. It's very easy to do.    Just do not forget to put it back on the charger for up to 8 hours. I've had mine for 3 months and love it still! My dad loves theirs and he asked his best friend and he said he has his for two years now and still loves it. Also, if you over charge it you'll wear out the battery, I haven't done this yet but I read up on it first before I bought mine. If you use it enough you'll know when it needs to be charged up again. The gears start slowing down to a hault fast.    This isn't a girly vacuum, it's for guys too!
0743298020|4.0|I have read quite a few of the classics, and this has such a feel.  Another reviewer called this a Gothic novel; I concur.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I have been lucky enough to encounter great films that I probably wouldn't have watched had it not been for Netflix.  I watched and fell in love with The Prestige and was curious about a movie that was being compared to it called The Illusionist.  Curious, I gave it a whirl.  First thing I have to say is that the stories of The Illusionist and The Prestige are nothing alike.  Content-wise, they have similar themes and setting (late Victorian, early Edwardian) and then there is the fact that the protagonists of both these films are magicians.  There are also some supernatural or magic realism elements in both films as well.  However, the similarities end there.  This movie centers on Eisenheim (Edward Norton), a famous and fascinating illusionist who is rumored to have supernatural powers and uses them on his magic tricks.  He reunites with his childhood friend Sophie, a young duchess who had planned to run away with him when they were teenagers (Jessica Biel).  They meet again and sparks fly, but Sophie is engaged to the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), who is corrupt and sadistic and has the power to get rid of anyone who gets in his way.  Leopold, suspicious of their mutual affection, uses Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) to find ways to get rid of Eisenheim.  Will Eisenheim and Sophie ever be free to be together?<br /><br />This is such a beautiful film.  The setting of Vienna during the turn of the twentieth century is truly breathtaking.  And the backdrop of magic and supernatural powers is just as eye catching.  This film is a feast for the eyes.  I absolutely love the twist at the end and it left me with a smile on my face.  This is a unique, suspenseful love story not like any other love story.  I have loved Edward Norton since watching him in Fight Club and he is absolutely wonderful here.  Biel and Sewell are also great in their roles.  Paul Giamatti, however, is a true showstopper here next to Norton.  He, like Michael Caine in The Prestige, plays a wonderfully complex character and you want him to be on the good guys' side.  The Illusionist has found a place in my DVD collection.  This is a must-see and a must-own for sure.  I love The Prestige for its dark theme, and I love The Illusionist for its magic and passion.  These films are similar and different at the same time, but one thing is for sure: they are both 100% recommended!erfully complex character and you want him to be on the good guys' side.

0385333846|5.0|I have always loved this author. Vonnegut's originality and humorous approach (deadpan., satirical, et al) to the absurd things humans do proves that there really isn't much new under the sun.<br /><br />Same old world. So we have better toys today than back in the 1960's? Are we any wiser?<br /><br /> I recently re-read this splendid novel(eerie given the news today) only about a month or two ago. It still stands. After all these decades,it still stands. Billy Pilgrim is the  modern, wounded-male archetype par excellence. We could easily transpose WWII for Iraq. Apt in any age but maybe even more so right now.<br /><br />You don't want to pass this one up, along with this author's more humorous works (BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS). I enjoyed re-reading this so much, I rank it as a favorite in the past year.

B000AYEL1A|3.0|The best part of this movie for me was the first half hour.<br />The hugely popular but superficial rock star played by Kristofferson is transfixed (as most viewers are) when he enters a small club after one of his concerts and hears Streisand sing.<br />Before he meets her, he is addicted to drugs and used to getting any girl he wants whenever he wants her.  He never has to work for anything.  His concerts are formulaic and uninspired, designed (as he puts it) to \\"give the fans what they want\\"... a series of meaningless stunts.<br />Streisand's character gives him something he can believe in.  Unlike his fans, she sees him for who he is, with all of his faults... and, unlike his fans, won't cater to his ego.<br /><br />The best moment in this film comes when Kristofferson's character gets up on stage to perform, repeating the same lines he uses in every concert, and singing the same song he sings that he sings at the beginning of every concert.  Half way through the first song, he stops.  Over the objections of the audience and his manager, he brings Streisand out on stage, and urges her to take his place.  What makes this moment great is not just Streisand's voice, but the contrast between her performance and his, and Kristofferson's recognition that his own popularity is based on something that is no longer important to him.<br /><br />After that moment, however, the film starts to go downhill.<br />Streisand's character falls hopelessly in love with Kristofferson for reasons that are never clear, and then asks him to marry her.  Why she suddenly falls for him I have no idea.  The entire dynamic between the two characters that is so entertaining in the first half hour is lost.  Kristofferson keeps trying to push her away.  He knows that he's no good for her... and he's right.<br /><br />Watching her falling all over him again and again as he self destructs is tiring.  There's simply nothing appealing or likable about his character.  After awhile, you just don't care what happens to him anymore.<br /><br />Streisand's performances, however, are certainly worth watching.  The scene in the recording studio (where she sings \\"Evergreen\\" to him) is classic.are what happens to him anymore.<br /><br />Streisand's performances, however, are certainly worth watching.

B00000J7J4|2.0|Okay, so Santana traded his integrity for those little green slips of paper with important dead guys on them decades ago, so it's no surprise he made out like a bandit by collaborating with the likes of Lauryn Hill, Dave Matthews and ROB THOMAS (why, Carlos? WHYYYYYYY????????????) playing the MOST commercial stuff imaginable. I mean, who's he gonna drag into the studio next? Scott Stapp? I hope not. That would be a dark day for Santana-dom.<br /><br />I know most kids my age were introduced to Santana via this album's 65.7234 billion hits. Not me, though. While I heard Smooth and the like before any \\"classic Santana\\", I didn't know it was by Santana at the time. So I was consciencelly exposed to 'Los through the classics: Black Magic Woman, Oye Como Va, Soul Sacrifice, No One to Depend On, Europa, etc. And did that stuff kick huge keister, or did it kick huge keister? I guess I did hear all the big-deal Supernatural/Shaman songs BEFORE Black Magic Woman and its compatriots, but again, I had no clue it was Santana. And that let me tell you, that stuff's a world away from this. I mean, this can't even lick Abraxas or Santana 3's boots. I like Smooth, though, even if we've all heard it thirty-five-and-three-quarters trillion times. Catchy song, even with ROB THOMAS (who I'd like to kick) doing his \\"soulful\\" moans and whispers. Honestly, that guy's got as much soul as courrogated cardboard. But that's okay, because of Santana's slinky, seductive six-string solo. (Like the alliteration?) Even better is (Da Le) Yaleo, a fun pseudo-instrumental with Latin lyrics; and the attack on U.S. immigration policies known as Migra. And Santana's still Santana, which means he can play his guitar like few others. One of the top guys in the guitar game.<br /><br />The downsides: pretty much everything else, starting with Maria Maria. What's Santana doing with rappers? I'll tell you what: laughing all the way to the bank as his fans buy the album in droves and are forced to put up with crap like that. And how many times can you mention \\"Spanish Harlem\\" in one song? No wonder these guys call themselves the \\"Product G&B\\" (which stands for \\"Ghetto & blues\\" - how ridiculous can you get?): they are, indeed, pure product. But why stop blasting this now? Africa Bamba is obviously an attempt to pull another Latin-sung smash. But it's not Oye Como Va or Guajira, I'll say that right now. Meanwhile, Put Your Lights On is invariably dull angsty rambling nobody in their right mind would listen to more than once, while Love of My Life wins the Least Original Title award AND the Least Original Song Award. Whoa, great winnings. Amazing. Or maybe I'd give both prizes to Do You Like the Way. I'm torn, somebody help me! And The Calling, with Eric Clapton, should be this godly guitar jam, because it's got ERIC CLAPTON! And he's a REALLY GOOD GUITARIST! And a COMPLETE SELLOUT! JUST LIKE SANTANA! My god, two massive sellouts on one song... the only thing that's missing is a Rod Stewart vocal spot, and they'd be all set. Getting back to the song itself, it's an extrodinary example of wanksmanship that goes on far too long.<br /><br />So yeah, it sold a bunch, but it's kind of bad... and really commercial... and stuff... and shouldn't be in the Definitive 200... yeah... don't know how to close the review...that.

0743298020|2.0|Ok, so The Thirteenth Tale is a modern gothic novel of sorts, and it is really not all that bad; however, it's a shame it has to be so formulaic and have that all too familiar \\"made-for-movie\\" flavor.  The story, the characters, the settings, the predictable twists and turns, even the title - it is all packaged in such an easily digestable manner that you wonder if the author can have any serious intent behind it. Nothing wrong with writing for pure entertainment; however, there remains a feeling that the author tried to give it a serious attempt before getting lured into the world of literary cliches...<br /><br />Yet again, overly eccentric women must have flaming red hair - funny how few ones have mousy brown locks.  Once again, twins have overly exaggerated cosmic ties to one another. And then we have the English moors for the proper somber backdrop, the dilapidated once-grand country manor, the dusty, but noble bookstore that exudes nostalgia, the conflicted narrator who feels the strange calling of her dead twin, the mysterious old Dame who holds all the secrets and slowly unravels the carefully constructed \\"mysteries\\"... and of course, the end is all neatly tied up with a happy conclusion for everyone who deserves it...<br /><br />There is a bleak resemblance to Spanish writer Zafon's \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" - another modern Gothic which has spent its share of time on bestseller lists and book club reading agendas. Although also slightly overrated, Zafon's book is a better compilation of gothic fare.<br /><br />All in all, it is a decent beach read; however, do not expect more than just that
B00070DK1E|3.0|Perhaps better known as \\"The one that won the Grammy\\", and Crest actually isn't all that bad of a record. I'd go out on a limb and say it's better than Thick as a Brick (yeah, I know if you dig deep enough in my profile you'll find a five-star review on that one, but it's only rated that high as of today because I'm too lazy to edit it - as of now, I'd give it two stars. Clearly, my mind's changed). Anyway, this is actually quite a good record for a band that walked off an artistic cliff after their FOURTH FRIGGIN' RECORD, and only reclaimed their former glory on occasion - think Minstrel in the Gallery, Heavy Horses and this one.<br /><br />This isn't as good as the group's two best: Stand Up and Benefit. (I'm serious. I think those two are their best). And the whole thing bottoms out on tracks like the ten-minute Budapest: I know Anderson regards it as their masterpiece, but it's snooze-inducingly dull and uncomfortably reminiscent of Thick as a Brick at times. Same with the war protest Mountain Man - I've always liked war protests, but the Far East gimmicks are grating (compare to Fat Man off Stand Up, which nails the Far East Sound and is pretty funny to boot). And the record's drenched in those stupid '80s drums. You know, the ones that play a straight \\"one two THREE four one two THREE four...\\" beat with absolutely no rolls, eighth or sixteenth notes, or anything else to break the monotony, to the point where they sound like metronomes? Yeah, those. You'd think they were drum machines, and for all I know, they were. But the credits list a live drummer, albeit one who sounds annoyingly like a metronome. To top off the complaint list, Anderson's voice ain't half of what it used to be, so he won't be doing the cool singing he did on Locomotive Breath and such.<br /><br />But when Crest's good, it's really good. I'm talkin' tracks like Steel Monkey, bolstered by Martin Barre (who still is so underrated it's shocking)'s guitar solo and a great \\"Can you guess my name/can you guess my trade?\\" refrain that stays in your head for ages; Farm on the Freeway, a nice little mellow environmentalist thing, classic Tull rocker-with-flute Jump Start, and especially the witty country-folk-rock Said She Was a Dancer, a Cold War espionage parody that works better than you'd think.<br /><br />So even though this sounds like Dire Straits (a band I despise with every fiber of my being - okay, I exaggerate, but I still hate them) at times, and even though it isn't creative, it doesn't wallow in egotistical misery like Thick as a Brick or WarChild, and there's some good music here.

0061015725|4.0|Prey is a classic Crichton thriller in that it takes cutting-edge science which the majority of the public knows little about, mixes it with taut action sequences and scientists too willing to step way past any ethical boundaries, and creates a foreboding sense of fear for the future of mankind.  Almost as much a horror tale as a science fiction piece, Prey has a coherent narrative and a chilling sense of dread about it that makes it a better read than Crichton's Next (somewhat scattered and over the top) or Timeline (not relevant enough to the average reader to be that scary).  In some ways it harkens back to and updates mood and the plot of Andromeda Strain.  The topic, nano-particles and swarm intelligence, has a futurist cachet, but still relates well to the average reader's experience and fears and, of course, makes Prey a less controversial read than Crichton's State of Fear (dealing with global warming).  While not quite at the level of Jurassic Park, Prey is a page-flipping techno-thriller which both frightens and educates.  Donald J. Bingle, Author of Forced Conversion.
0374105235|5.0|It seems that many people in the West, including myself, are largely unaware of what has transpired in Sierra Leone. This is a touching account told by a skilled storyteller. Lighthearted content, such as the author's musical tastes, is skillfully mixed with the grim realities of being a 12 year old solider in Sierra Leone. He portrays his involvement in the civil war in a fashion that is very compelling. The account is personal but also very maturely composed.<br /><br />Ishmael was thrust into this war when rebels killed his family. He then proceeds to slaughter and fight, and eventually discovers that revenge can be an endless cycle only leading to chaos and ugliness. After many adventures which seem unfit for a 12 year old, he was chosen to go to New York to speak at a UN children's conference. He is totally awestruck about New York and puzzled by the white things falling from the air. He then returns to Sierra Leone to more chaos, and then eventually moves to the U.S.<br /><br />The countless kids who get drawn into the war either by force, necessity, or familial revenge are all deeply impacted by the things they experience. It is hard to imagine what sort of horrible scars this sort of experiences leaves in the life of a 12 year old. And as if the emotional trauma wasn't enough, the author also documents the heavy use of drugs such as cocaine.<br /><br />There aren't really any sort of explicit religious, spiritual, philosophical, or theological statements in the book. Implicit in the book is a tension between pessimism and optimistic humanism. There are passing references to Muslim clerics and the religious practices of other people, but religion is not a central theme and there are no personal reflections that are obviously religious. The book leaves a few seemingly unfinished trains of thought. I sort of wish the author would have filled in a few of the blanks, but it did add a bit to the intruige.<br /><br />Ishmael has not only profound experiences to share, but also a great amount of talent as a writer. This is a memorable book. I highly recommend reading it.alent as a writer. This is a memorable book. I highly recommend reading it.

How else would the people who happened to be in the right place at the right time be able to gloat about their \\"accomplishment\\" in buying a thing when it was available?<br /><br />Hey, people should just EXPECT that things aren't going to be available for reasonable durations of time, and blow ALL THE MONEY THEY HAVE on them just to make sure they get these things before they're GONE FOREVER.<br /><br />Viva la glorification del consumerismo!
B000KWZ7VU|5.0|If any contemporary pianist can be said to \\"own\\" the Beethoven piano sonatas, it is Daniel Barenboim.  This is his third traversal of the complete sonatas, and by any standard, this latest is his greatest effort - bringing the distillation of a lifetime of living with this music that he has been playing since he was eight years old.  In the end, one comes away from these concerts with a renewed appreciation for the range, creativity, genius and sheer daring of Beethoven as a composer.   <br /> <br />The sonatas are presented in a series of eight concerts, often with selections from each of Beethoven's early, middle and late years.  For example, the first concert presents three sontatas - numbers 1, 18 and 29 (the Hammerklavier).  In addition, there are two bonus disks with Barenboim presenting a series of 55-minute master classes with six talented young pianists, each of whom plays a movement from one of the Beethoven sonatas and then Barenboim offers his observations and suggestions, often illustrating his point by playing on his own piano. He comments on a wide range of topics - the sonata at hand, music in general, piano playing and its special demands, life in general - replete with occasional anecdotes and stories.  He takes questions from the audience at the end of each session.   <br /> <br />For anyone who loves great piano playing, this set is a must.   <br />
B000002L42|4.0|I was looking around in a used music shop for some Donald Fagan albums a couple of months ago when I happened upon this little gem. Being a devoted Steely Dan fan, I decided to give it a try, and boy am I glad I did. I've now listened to it a number of times and it just gets better every time I hear it. That cool, jazzy sound that is inevitably Steely Dan is wonderfully accomodating for a live album such as this, with subtle variations on old favorites like \\"Reelin' In The Years\\", and a delightfully spontaneous drum solo in \\"Josie\\". Steely Dan generates a cool energy for this live album, and Walter Becker proves that Fagen is not the only one who can tear the roof off the sucker in his vocal performance of \\"Book Of Liars\\", my personal favorite.  <br />  This album is not just for the hardcore Steely Dan listeners. I would recomend it to anyone brand new to the funky, arcanic world of Steely Dan. And for those who already own every album, well, you can never have too much Steely Dan. A welcome new addition to any collection
B000JK8OYU|5.0|This is a great remastering of classic Beatles hits. Listening with headphones is the only way to really appreciate the remastering.
B00005K9LK|5.0|Forget all the negative stuff you have ever read about this album. This is the most commercially successful Priest album ever. 30 years later it still holds it's own. This album stands, like a sentry, at the gates of metal's golden era. When this first came out the local hard rock radio stations played this entire album, which was very unusual. The number of colossal cuts on here start with The Helion/Electric Eye, followed by Riding On The Wind, Devils Child and You've Got Another Thing Commin', which got major air time on every rock station. The rest of this release is also very good. If you like metal, you simply must own this piece of history.
B00006DEFA|5.0|Brilliantly conceived, movingly enacted, grandiose in scope, this epic fiction intertwines the life of the miserable but gifted Mozart with the envious, correct, but ultimately mediocre Antonio Salieri. The result is a showcase of cinematic talent set to the score of some of Mozart's finest music.<br /><br />Though recent Mozart scholarship tends to rehabilitate the man's reputation and distance him from the film's wildly eccentric bacchanal who ended up dumped in a paupers' common grave and mourned by few, the narrative path of this film is - apart from its dubious historical warrant - the product of genius.<br /><br />The scene where a dying Mozart dictates his Requiem to Albinoni is zany and impossible, yet still an adrenaline-pumping piece of dramatic fiction and one of the film's proudest moments.<br /><br />All eight of this film's Oscars were well earned.
B0000630BT|4.0|This may sound like heresy , but this is probably their second best album after Screaming For Vengeance . Just keep in mind that this is full bore speed metal . Tipton and Downing have never sounded better . Scott Travis lays down some of the best, and certainly the fastest , drum work ever on a Priest album . Ian Hill is as solid as ever and Halford still can belt it out with the best of them . So why not 5 stars ? Two reasons , the lyrics aren't as creative as other Priest albums ( sorry Rob ) and the three best cuts ( Painkiller , A Touch Of Evil and Night Crawler ) are all on Metal Works . If you are a Priest fan BUY THIS .
0679720200|4.0|So said Janis Joplin. She could well have been describing the freedom of this book's protagonist. One can read it as death by apathy, suicide by executioner.<br /><br />It starts with Meursault tonelessly addressing the facts of his mother's death. Even before that event, Meusrault had become anhedonic, judging the world in terms of its cost to him, not its value. Yes, he had straitened circumstances of a sort, but not dire. For whatever reason (and the irrelevance of that reason is itself striking), the scene opens on a man whose emotional fusebox is a scorched ruin. Whatever had once driven him, had long since burned out. In that state, even moral imperatives become mere habits - the cruise control of a mind that's lost its moral, feeling guidance. Then, possibly for valid reason, he kills a man.<br /><br />Racial politics of the 1940s could be invoked, or valid self-defense. It seems likely, though, that Meursault shot him, repeatedly, because his deadened mind could think of no reason not to. His thoughts had shrunk into such small orbits that they no longer encompassed any sense of future or any sense of person, even his own.<br /><br />A bizarre trial follows. The charge is murder, but the prosecution is about emotion. Meursault can not mount even his own defense in this capital case, to convince the jury that he is a feeling being. He is convicted, and awaits his transformation under the guillotine's blade. One last, devoted defender of faith and scourge of reason visits him in his cell. That final voice, entirely in tones and clothes of black and white, tries desperately to strike a spark on Meursault's sodden mind, and fails.<br /><br />All that's left is all that's left. I guess that's true for anyone, though. If you see more, it's because you see what's in you. Meursault saw what was in himslf, and just didn't care.<br /><br />Just couldn't care.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B000000JO3|5.0|The first half of the album is really great punk rock, played with great speed, and great precision too!  Then, by the second half you start to notice the progression in the band, and a little bit of the music gives hints about the future sound of Embrace and Fugazi, although still much more punk in nature!

0618680004|5.0|There are basically two ways of falsifying religion.  Historians prove that religion IS NOT true by tracing all claims of a god revealing its existence to the same Tanakh, Bible and Koran that assure their readers that the earth is flat.<br /><br />Philosophers prove that religion CANNOT be true by showing that, if the universe is produced and directed by an omnipotent, omnibenevolent overlord, then such evils as the 2005 tsunami and the AIDS virus could not exist.<br /><br />Dawkins shows that, for religion to be true,  then humans and other animals could not have similar DNA inherited from common ancestors, the universe could not be old enough for the light from the most distant quasars to reach us for a further 15 billion years, and the wasp that lays its eggs in the abdomen of living spiders (a la Alien) could not exist.<br /><br />Since religious dogma on such matters is observably wrong, it follows that religion's Big Daddy in the sky is as imaginary as Mother Goose.<br /><br />It is axiomatic among disinformation peddlers:  When you have no defence, attack.  It was therefore not unforeseeable that theologians, persons who claim expertise in the thing that is not, and prelates, administrators of the thing that is not, would denounce \\"The God Delusion\\" with unreasoned vitriol.  Since religion pushers classify going with the evidence as the ultimate heresy, and instead start from predetermined conclusions and distort the evidence to make it fit, they hate and fear Dawkins for the same reason Al Capone hated and feared Elliot Ness.  And so they should.  Dawkins is the pushers' worst nightmare.

B000001FDK|5.0|Although I'm not usually a fan of movie soundtracks, my one big exception is Grease! Who wouldn't love this collection of sing-along songs that brighten your mood no matter when, or how often, you listen to them? Since Grease is also one of my all-time favorite movies, hearing the songs automatically makes me recall the particular scene they correlate with, and I invariably start smiling.  <br /> <br />Grease consists of many talented actors and actresses, most of whom could sing as well as they could act. Therefore, each song -- including numerous solos by John Travolta, Oliva Newton-John and Stockard Channing -- is a treat to listen to.  <br /> <br />If I were only allowed to bring one CD to the proverbial deserted island, Grease would probably be it! This is one purchase that will pay off, time and time again.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|\\"Firefly\\" may have had a short run, but the boxed set does this excellent SF series justice.  The originally intended order of the individual episodes (including episodes that did not air during the original run) has been restored, and there are some nice \\"making of\\" extras on the last disc of the set.  While the (accurate) summary \\"SF Western\\" may not sound like much, the intelligent and witty scripts, clever worldbuilding, and excellent acting/characterizations make \\"Firefly\\" something special, and enjoyable.
B000LPS47U|4.0|As a teen and a horror fan in the 80's, I loved all things horror. Watched and enjoyed practically any horror film to come along and never got enough of them. Then the inevitable happened....I grew up and my adult tastes changed drastically. I will occasionally re-visit those horror films from my youth, usually laughing at them, but regarding them with fondness. When re-watching The Re-Animator recently, I realized that this was a great film.....period. It holds up extremely well in present times, and is superior to 99% of all the well regarded new horrors being released today. (yes, I still watch the ones that receive great acclaim)  Made on a small budget, The Re-Animator will amaze the viewer with it's impressive F/X.  Considering it's a  cast of 'B' actors, the viewer will deeply appreciate the great acting by the entire cast, for all horror fans know great acting usually doesn't surface in horror films. lol  The director of this film kept things going at a very pleasing and fast pace, and the editing was done with great care and skill.  Yes, this film has gore, lots of it, but it was utilized to perfection and complimented the story very well. The gory scenes all mattered, and weren't there just for the sake of having gore. They were handled brilliantly.  The score for this film was obviously an homage to the score from Psycho, and it works wonderfully.  The dark comedy of this film was also handled with perfection (a difficult accomplishment) never becoming silly or groan inducing. It's dark and it's FUNNY.  Again, I must praise the entire cast, from the leads to the bit players, for all performed with skills not usually found in \\"gory\\" horror films. The leads all had great chemistry together, and this is a huge asset to any horror film. A special nod to Jeffrey Combs (as Dr. Herbert West) for proving that a \\"hammy\\" performance, when done properly, can be a thing to cherish.  I would recommend The Re-Animator to all, even non-horror fans, because this little films holds up well and still packs quite a wallop to the viewer. It's proof positive that when a horror film is done right, it holds it own when compared to any genre. A ton of fun, indeed.
B000KC8O3S|5.0|Whether you're a fan of the new Doctor Who TV series or not, if you enjoy soundtracks this album is an excellent buy.  Murray Gold's cinematic-style orchestral arrangments range from dramatic to eerie to wistful.  I like to have this album playing while I type, read, or work on other creative projects since it's inspirational without the distractions of lyrics.  Also included are two \\"apocryphal\\" radio pop songs, \\"Love Don't Roam\\" and \\"Song for Ten,\\" written specifically for the program.  Both stand on their own merits quite well, and provide fans with in-jokes from the series itself -- the only downside is that \\"Song for Ten\\" is a re-recorded version, rather than the one that originally played on the TV series (and which I rather prefer).  Personal faves: the haunting \\"Doctor's Theme,\\" the meditative \\"Impossible Planet,\\" and the dramatic \\"Dalek\\" theme, complete with with an alien-language chorus.
B000F0UUIM|5.0|No doubt about it, The Searchers is a western masterpiece. It's the ONLY film that I can easily overlook it's faults that appear throughout the film. The faults I speak of are the scenes of \\"cornball\\" humor that are scattered all through the film. They simply don't work nor belong in this mature and intense film. Humor was NOT John Ford's forte, and he seemed to prefer the cornball variety, and granted, it did work in some of his films, but in The Searchers it was definitely out of place. <br />Amazingly, this film is so spectacular in every other aspect, that forgiving the cornball humor is a very easy thing to do.  <br />The Searchers is not only beautiful to look at, but it's beautiful to listen to as well. This film is one of a rare handful that completely captures a specific time, place, mood and atmosphere and will suck the viewer into it's mighty vortex and put them smack dab in the middle of it. It's truly a stunning visual experience with a very complex and absorbing story, and it possesses symbolic gestures that are utilized with skill and effectiveness, never resorting to pretentiousness like most \\"symbolic\\" films.  <br />What more can be said about John Wayne's perfect performance in the lead role ? He was absolutely, positively born to play this role, and he turns it into a perfection personified experience. It's hard to believe there are a few misguided souls who claim Wayne wasn't a great actor. (this performance especially and several more to his resume makes those naysayers seem like babbling fools) <br />The Searchers has rightfully been acknowledged as an American classic, and a true masterpiece of cinema, and thankfully, it's the film that many have come to admit proved John Wayne as an important actor. (his fans knew it all along) <br />Highly recommended.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I love this movie. If you dont like it then i dont have any clue why poeple need to understand that its not just a bond movie its actually a movie it breaks out of the usual bond formula and i think thats what makes it great. also the action is incredible
0440234743|3.0|This 533-paged book was my first John Grisham novel (and perhaps my last).  It was billed as his \\"best novel in years\\" and \\"a compulsory page-turner\\".  It wasn't a compulsory page-turner and I found it difficult to believe that John Grisham hasn't written better stuff than this, simply because he is so popular.<br /><br />The novel's mediocrity came from its predictable plot and newspaper reporting style of telling the action.  I was kept wondering when things would heat up in the plot.  Would the protagonist learn that the apparent suicide of Troy Phelan was really murder?  Would he figure out how they made Troy's murder look like a suicide?  And would he discover who \\"they\\" are?  Nothing as juicy as that - the old geezer really did jump out the window by his own volition.  Just a very predicable plot of spoilt brats and their lawyers fighting over the old geezer's inheritance.<br /><br />The protagonist was unable to draw me into the plot. He was too unreal to capture my sympathy.  When he drank himself sick in his Brazilian hotel room, that was the end of his story.  But he immediately and unrealistically goes on the wagon. His religious conversion was also wanting.  He had heard that spiel so many times before.  He had been near death so many times before as well, so that this time was no worse than the other times before.  What had happened that saved his soul from the evils of the bottle?  It wasn't there. And the woman he sought became unreal when she chased after him to leave him executor of her inheritance trust.<br /><br />It was also irritating when Grisham referred to Native South Americans as \\"Indians\\".  The Ipica Americans of Brazil's Pantanal region have never been to Delhi, Calcutta, or Bombay.  People from India are Indians just as people from Ireland are Irish.  People from the Americas are Americans.  Columbus was wrong in thinking that he had made three trips to India.  And it is wrong to call indigeonous Americans \\"Indians\\".<br /><br />In short, this was a novel that didn't live up to its billing.br />In short, this was a novel that didn't live up to its billing.

B0007PAMR4|3.0|Some fun facts:<br /><br />Dune was written and published in 1965<br /><br />Star Wars was released in 1978<br /><br />Dune the movie was released in 1984<br /><br />I first saw Star Wars in the theaters in 1978 and became hooked to the series.<br /><br />I never watched Dune or read it until recently and this is my take on the whole thing.<br /><br />When I sat down and watched Dune I was surprised by the cheap sets and poor special effects. Star Wars had this movie beat hands down.<br /><br />However, when it comes to the story of Dune: it is a great and amazing plot and adventure. I can now see where George Lucas was inspired for Star Wars.<br /><br />As far as this DVD it has lots of hours of entertainment. You just have to get past some of the cheesy sets and filming.<br /><br />All in all its a good DVD to have in your collection.
0374105235|4.0|Very interesting read....gave me a great sense of understanding and pictorial overview of the situation in Sierre Leone. Riveting and beautiful.  All should read
B000GIXEIG|4.0|I will be honest: I love Gerard Butler in long-haired warrior roles, and that's the main reason I bought this DVD. Critics seemed indifferent to it and, although I'm from an entertainment-journalism family, I'd heard nothing about the film, so I figured it would be a long slog. OK, yes, the film is long, yet it goes surprising places. The story you think it will be is not the story that it turns out to be. The landscape is bleak and yet oddly inspiring, and the terrific performances from Stellan Skaarsgard and Gerard Butler--in what seem to me extremely complicated roles, particularly Skaarsgard's--bring life to what looks like a suicidally bleak existence lived by these Danes. Sorry, but a pint of grog and a wench don't seem as if they'd put the average guy in a good enough frame of mind to survive a few decades in the blinding fog (never mind the women's lives). One correction to another reviewer's comment about the distracting \\"American\\" accent: Sarah Polley is Canadian. I do recommend this film. Go somewhere with this story you haven't been in a movie before.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|This is an aboslutely amazing movie. Being a teenager, you can really relate to this movie. But adults no doubt can too from their highschool days. You will laugh and maybe cry. The story behind it is truly beautiful. 5 stereotype highschool students end up in detention together and discover after pouring their hearts our to each other, that they have much more in common then they thought. \\"They only met once, but it changed their lives forever.\\"

B00030EEOU|5.0|U2 is truly amazing. This is their 14th, and one of their greatest albums. The sound is quite different from the earlier albums that most people are used to such as the Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby, but the songs have very deep meaning and are beautiful. This album is a must have!
B00003CXA6|5.0|Gettysburg may seem kinda long for most people, but it is defenitley worth the time! I have watched it many, many times over! Civil war buff or not, you need to watch it!
B000BMSU68|5.0|This is my all-time most favorite movie ever!!!!!!!... It is a true testament to taking life easy, and having fun. Some times we all just need to relax and take the day off! Ferris fakes sick and takes the day off with his girlfriend Sloane and best bud Cameron. They travel around the city of Chicago doing all sorts of crazy things. THIS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE. Matthew Broderick is totally awesome in the movie. You can't beat it!!!!! \\"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.\\" -Ferris Bueller

Hiromi is really on the path to laying new foundations for jazz piano, and piano trio...Check out Brain and Spiral, unbelievable!
B000001DTM|5.0|How can you beat U2. Just the fact that they have stuck together with all original band members for all these years is truly amazing. U2's music is really awesome, and this is one of their best albums.
B000850IHW|5.0|In reading the other reviews I must agree that this album is the place to start if you want to get to know GG. Fantastic musicianship from start to finish. Great use of instruments giving way to other instruments in linking passages of songs that... Yes! Are interesting in their arrangements and time signatures yet, in many ways, still find a way to rock. The music is mostly upbeat, intricate and changing. Without a doubt this album -from a musicians stand-point - is always interesting!!! If you like this I'd give \\" Power and the Glory \\" a spin next.
B00003XACV|5.0|I enjoyed reading D. Mok's review, but I am compelled to disagree about the invisibility of the score due to intricacy with the action, mood, and so on of the film.  The first time I watched American Beauty I noticed the score.  It's so gentle, patient, and gorgeous - I don't know how anyone can miss it. <br /> <br />When I go to watch this movie again - and I have more than once - I am always waiting for the music to move me into the world of the characters.  I cannot imagine the film beginning with a better tune than \\"Dead Already.\\"  I cannot imagine the plastic bag dancing without its music.  I cannot imagine Lester ogling Angela without his music (and her dancing).  And that is one of the secrets of great art - if one's work is so complete that the audience is incapable of imagining a better brush stroke or better placement of music, the artist is viewed as great and an authority. <br /> <br />To pretend that I don't notice the greatness of Thomas Newman's score every time I watch the movie is not only dishonest, but an insult to Newman.  I don't think D. Mok intended dishonesty or insult.  I believe that the score stands on its own, although in a different way than it stands with the movie.  With the movie, it flows easily and naturally.  Without the movie, pieces of the film and strong emotions filter into your mind; it's a different experience, indeed, and it's one I recommend to everyone.
0618680004|5.0|Excellent logical review and dissection of religeon.  A must read for anyone who has ever wondered why they were being asked to believe so heartfeltly in something that quite probably was not true.
B000NA77YO|4.0|Like many who have reviewed this album, I think the absence of The Sign of the Southern Cross is a serious flaw in an otherwise respectable collection.  That said, this is still a good compilation for anyone getting acquainted with the Dio led version of Black Sabbath, and perhaps that omission is meant to encourage a newcomer to seek out what's missing.  It is, after all, called The Dio Years, not The Best of the Dio Years.  In any case the only reason for a serious fan to own this instead of the individual albums from which most of the tracks are culled, is for the three new songs at the end.  They aren't necessarily for completists only, but I don't think these songs offer much in the way of new ground or a fresh start.  After this many years the Iommi/Dio approach is pretty well cemented, so the new songs fit comfortably with material written decades ago.  Only a noticeable improvement in sound quality distinguishes them from the rest.  They're also represented in the album notes as the preview to a forthcoming Sabbath album.  Given their history, I'm inclined to think that's all they could crank out before they folded up yet again.
B00005JNX0|5.0|Some people complain about the poor storyline,character developement,and say it's just a bunch of jokes compiled into a script.I say who cares?The movie is hilarious!It is one of the few animated comedies that I have actually laughed at.There are a few crude jokes and language issues for younger viewers,but not so bad.You'll be mimicking the penguins and singing \\"I like to move it move it\\"for days.Honestly,if you're looking for entertainment,look no further.
B00062IVKS|5.0|I don't think I could say a single thing about \\"Raging Bull\\" that someone else hasn't said before me. Even though it's acclaimed frequently as one of the greatest films of all time (rightfully so), it's unjustly billed as a sports film. A boxing movie. It's because of this that it took me so long to see it in the first place. Sure, it's a biopic about a boxer and boxing plays a big part in the film but it's not a sports film. It's a film about a troubled man and his sexual insecurities disguised as a boxing movie. Robert DeNiro (who won the Oscar for the role) plays boxer Jake La Motta; a man who lost a few matches but was never knocked out. A man who would take hundreds of punches just to land one. La Motta, who is vying for the championship, soon meets the 15-year-old blonde bombshell Vickie (Cathy Moriarty) whom he soon marries. Problem is, Jake doesn't trust her (or really anyone around him) and is constantly paranoid about what his wife does. In one pivotal scene, when Vickie mentions that a boxer Jake is about to fight is cute, he beats the boy to a pulp causing a man to lean over to his friend in the audience and say \\"he ain't pretty no more.\\" Even Jake's brother Joey (Joe Pesci, who should've beat Timothy Hutton for the Oscar) falls prey to Jake's paranoia. Anyone who says DeNiro's performance is incredible is understating it massively. This film displays the best performance I've ever seen by DeNiro and, easily, one of the best performances ever. The things he does for this role are absolutely incredible; From the way he makes his body look from the beginning of the film to the end of the film, to his fake nose, just everything about it...Tour de force has never been a used more appropriately than to describe his performance. Martin Scorsese is a magnificent director who has a long filmography filled with masterpieces, but I wouldn't be stretching the truth by suggesting that \\"Raging Bull\\" may very well be his best film. It's no wonder The American Film Institute ranks it as the 24th best film of all time and the reason it is still talked about today. It seems that even though \\"Ordinary People\\" beat it out for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, I'm almost positive that years from now \\"Raging Bull\\" will most be remembered. If you've never considered seeing \\"Raging Bull\\" because it doesn't seem like your type of movie, than you have no idea what you're missing. If you hadn't had a chance to see it yet, but want to, you should see it not. It's a masterpiece of cinema and truly deserves to be called one of the one hundred best films of all time. <br /> <br />GRADE: A <br />
B0000024K1|5.0|I'm compelled to provide a review. For one reason. Why the f isn't this a five star album? Some reviewers out their need their keyboards revoked. I've been listening to this record on and off for almost 20 years. Each time I get the same old buzz. My old (much loved) Pixies albums don't come close in terms of providing everlasting pleasure. <br /> <br />For those that don't own this, just \\"do yourself a favour.\\" <br /> <br />BTW - DJ Spooky Trojan Records excursion is a blast....(on the platter as I write)
B000AL5OZK|3.0|My ranking has nothing to do with the album itself. Of her four post abba releases, this one ranks as her BEST. Top vocal form, solid production. My beef with this cd is more technical than musical. Universal seems to have more issues \\"wrapped around\\" the release of this 2005 version:<br /><br />1. Faulty remastering. listening to track 1 after the 11th second gives you the feeling that you're listening to tape that's been mishandled. I'm not the only one who observed this. in fact, universal music germany acknowledged this by replacing my product with a \\"version 03\\". as one of the tracks on the tracks on this cd would put it...\\"shame, shame, shame on you!\\"<br /><br />2. while i'd give the folks in universal germany credit for replacing the cd quickly, the problem was never licked entirely - you would still hear the glitch, but its less audible this time. \\"can't shake loose\\" also suffered from the same problem. at one point in the song, you'd hear a slight \\"drop out\\" (like tape would sound when it is smudged) towards the end. the irony is, the cd was remastered by \\"masters of audio\\".<br /><br />3. poor a&r - whose idea was it to include such inane tracks like \\"p&b\\" and \\"it's so nice to be rich\\"? not only are they mismatched as far as sonic quality is concerned, they don't fit in musically. and where is the u.s. remix of \\"can't shake loose\\" which peacked at the u.s. top 30? why wasn't THAT included?
1582701709|1.0|I thought I was really onto something here.  It turns out this book is just \\"The Power of Positive Thinking\\" in disguise.  I don't mean to say it's a BAD book.  But it's nothing you haven't heard a zillion times before:  \\"Think nice thoughts and nice things will happen to you.\\"  And vise-versa.  I am totally bored and disappointed by this book. But it's going to make the writer a billionaire.  I guess she's been thinking \\"nice thoughts.\\"  I feel like vomiting.
B000N3T0DW|5.0|This is Pedro Almodovar's latest and possibly greatest screen achievement, but only if you are a fan of Mr. Almodovar.  Any user review, of course, will reflect the opinion and taste of the writer, but of the half dozen DVDs of successful and highly praised films I've acquired and watched in the past few weeks, I have enjoyed Volver far above any other.<br /><br />Mr. Almodovar has been redefining the term \\"Woman's Picture\\" for the past decade or so.  For some reason (possibly because he's an out gay man, who is not afraid of his feminine side) Mr. Almodovar excels at making films that seem to especially resonate with women and gay men, sort of like a modern Cukor.  I have noticed however that many heterosexual men are unable to warm to his style.  As far as I am concerned, that's their loss.<br /><br />Almodovar's deft, quick directing skills have never been used to better effect than they are here.  Although a little over two hours in running time, the popular director (who also wrote the screenplay) divulges information in each scene effectively and wisely, so that nary a moment of screen time is wasted on unnecessary detail or confusing extra narrative.  Much like the better films of Alfred Hitchcock, Mr. Almodovar rarely introduces data into his storyline without a purpose.<br /><br />Volver (which in Spanish is a verb meaning, \\"To come back\\") concerns a group of women in the La Mancha region of Spain, all of whom are close relatives, friends or neighbors.  Although many reviewers have classified Volver as soap opera, and many more as totally unbelievable, I had little problem imagining most of what is depicted in the story as absolutely possible; in fact, I found the script to be utterly rich in irony, drama and realism.  Although classified as a \\"comedy\\", it is only funny in passing moments, and I enjoyed it far more for its genuinely moving drama than its laughs.  The plot turns were frequent and always kept me wondering what would happen next.  The ending was highly satisfactory, and I always marvel at Almodovar's ability to balance sentimentality with credibility, without coming off as maudlin or manipulative in the slightest.<br /><br />As for the actual plot, I would like to give anyone who hasn't seen it a chance to discover for themselves the wonderful surprises Mr. Almodovar sets up in almost every scene.  Suffice it to say that Volver concerns the resolution of secrets from beyond the grave, but does not contain more than a hint of the supernatural.  Indeed, Mr. Almodovar's characters are completely of this earth, and very much concerned with real life, with its amusing or tragic twists and turns.  Its themes explore motherly love, revenge and forgiveness with a highly developed sense of irony, deftly layering one plot turn on top of another until it all gels in a perfectly seamless climax.  When it was over, I once again marveled at the director's ability to condense such a complicated story into what seemed like a fairly short film, while managing to keep the complex characters and subplots simple and crystal clear.  Too often when a screenwriter or director tries for a \\"feel good\\" conclusion it ends up as cheap or schmaltzy, but there is not a false note about the admittedly sentimental ending.  I would be remiss if I did not mention that virtually every member of the cast gives a solid, believable performance, not only Pen&eacute;lope Cruz, who has gotten so much attention (and deservedly so), as the rest of the cast is also outstanding.  If you liked Almodovar's earlier films, you are sure to love this one.  If you have avoided him up to now, I can't think of a better place to start.pen next.

B000JJSRNY|5.0|If you love good operaric singing but you're not in the mood for an entire opera, play this festive and informal DVD from the 2006 outdoors Berlin concert. Everybody-the singers,the conductor, the orchestra, the audience-is happy and having a good time. The informality of the concert does not diminish or affect the quality of singing or the orchestra playing. Domingo's almost exclusive involvement with the dramatic/heroic tenor roles has not affected the legato and timbre of his voice, and its expressiveness and lyricism are so beautiful in \\"Federico's\\" aria from L'Arlesiana. Villazon's clarion and top ring are glorious. Netrebko's voice is bigger, darker and sweeter. In the last encore from Lehar's \\"Merry Widow,\\" Netrebko overpowers both Doomingo and Villazon in the last high note the three are singing together! The video is sharp and first rate. The audio is well-balanced, and thanks to Armiliato's conducting and fine acoustics engineering, it produces a studio quality sound. This DVD deserves, unquestionably, 5 stars for entertainment and artistic value.  <br /> <br />Constantine A. Papas <br />El Paso, Texas
B000065V1V|3.0|Someone actually wrote a review and said this is as good as \\"Heroes\\", which is ridiculous. Not that this is a bad album, it's not.  But \\"Heroes\\" happens to be one of my favorite Bowie albums, and this frankly doesn't compare. In fact, I don't know how anyone can rate anything past Scary Monsters with 5 stars.  That being said, I like this album.  I believe this may be some of his best work since 1980. People soon forget how influential, experimental, and possibly ground-breaking Bowie's 70's work was, that they await another album of that calibur. It is very rare that any artist has a stretch of \\"important\\" music as long as Bowie's was. Accept it, he probably will not make another album as good as Scary Monsters or prior.   So, if you are a Bowie fan, you will like this album. I personally wish this album was more ambient or post-rock sounding. This album is much better than 'hours...'
0451209338|4.0|The spy thriller, \\"The Kill Artist,\\" by  New York Times bestselling author  Daniel Silva, is a tight, fast-moving, well-grounded  mystery/thriller. (Knowledgeable circles consider this American author's work to be accurate on its spy craft, and to be informed on the procedures of Israel's spy agency, Mossad; and America's Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).)  In it, Gabriel Allon, is once again the Kill Artist.  He is Israeli-born, kibbutz-raised; a spy/hit man for his people, while being, at the same time, a talented art restorer.  Thus, he both heals and destroys; I think we can all agree, that's a significant combination.<br /><br />In this book, Allon is called out of retirement by Ari Shamron, former head of the Israeli secret service, or Mossad, to combat a Palestinian terrorist killer, Tariq, before he can bring down an important target. A beautiful French fashion model, Jacqueline, is similarly called back on the same mission. The book is tightly plotted and engrossing; the action moves, London, Paris, Amsterdam, Jerusalem, Washington, Montreal. It is not, of course, always entirely realistic. But it includes a dandy standoff between Tariq and his famous target, and ends on a surprise you might never see coming; Shamron, surprise, has not been completely honest with either Allon or Jacqueline.<br /><br />There's also a newspaper tycoon who seems to be a combination of Rupert Murdoch, and the famous Robert Maxwell, English newspaper tycoon active a few years ago: Maxwell's mysterious death appears to be echoed in this telling. Furthermore, there are at least a half-dozen nods to John LeCarre, British spymaster extraordinaire, in the first pages.<br /><br />The author's characters are individuated and well-drawn, and his writing is resonant.  He's witty and terse, as well.  .  He has been called his generation's finest writer of international intrigue and one of the greatest American spy novelists ever. Compelling, passionate, haunting, brilliant: these are some of the words that have been used to describe his work.<br /><br />Silva burst onto the scene in 1997 with his electrifying bestselling debut, [[ASIN:0451209303 The Unlikely Spy]] , a novel of love and deception set around the Allied invasion of France in World War II. His second and third novels,  [[ASIN:0451209311 The Mark of the Assassin]] and  [[ASIN:045120932X The Marching Season]], were also instant New York Times bestsellers that  starred two of Silva's most memorable characters: CIA officer Michael Osbourne and international hit man Jean-Paul Delaroche. But it was Silva's fourth novel,THE KILL ARTIST, which would alter the course of his career. The novel featured a character described as one of the most memorable and compelling in contemporary fiction, the art restorer and sometime Israeli secret agent Gabriel Allon, and though Silva did not realize it at the time, Gabriel's adventures had only just begun. Gabriel Allon appears in Silva's next nine novels, each one more successful than the last.<br /><br />Silva knew from a very early age that he wanted to become a writer, but his first profession would be journalism. Born in Michigan, raised and educated in California, he was pursuing a master's degree in international relations when he received a temporary job offer from United Press International to help cover the 1984 San Francisco Democratic National Convention . Later that year Silva abandoned his studies and joined UPI fulltime, working first in San Francisco, then on the foreign desk in Washington, and finally as Middle East correspondent in Cairo and the Persian Gulf. In 1987, while covering the Iran-Iraq war, he met NBC Today National Correspondent Jamie Gangel. They were married later that year. Silva returned to Washington, went to work for CNN, became executive producer of its talk show unit including shows like Crossfire, Capital Gang and Reliable Sources.<br /><br />In 1995 the writer confessed to his wife Jamie that his true ambition was tobe a novelist. With her support and encouragement he secretly began work on the manuscript that would eventually become the instant bestseller The Unlikely Spy. He left CNN in 1997 after the book's successful publication,. began writing full time. Since then all of Silva's books have been New York Times and international bestsellers. His books have been translated in to more than 30 languages and are published around the world.  Conclusion: people know the real thing when they see it.be a novelist.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Since I saw the BBc 1973 version with Michael Jayston and Sorcha Cusack, and 1983 with Timothy Dalton i thought that there won`t be other great adaptations, but this new series is quite amazing. Ruth Wilson makes a truly Jane Eyre and the scenes with Mr Rochester are very, very romantic. Great photographie, very good characters and a story really faithful to the book make this adaptation a masterpiece that all people that loves Jane Eyre must see it!
B000N6TX1I|1.0|PD James wrote a very interesting book, but this movie is just awful. Why a director/producers cannot replicate a book with the same emotional intensity is beyond me. The book has an incredible plot which the movie uses as its central theme -the reality that man is now infertile and the population is going to die off. The movie, however, becomes a propaganda film for immigration issues and a political agenda that is so overt that it is silly. The acting is sub-par at best. Clive Owen looks like he could care less about being in the movie and the entire cast looks lost at times. The dialogue is sloppy, the acting is poor and the book that is an interesting read is ruined by this sorry piece of film work.  <br /> <br />Read the book. Don't rent this movie.
B00008PBZW|5.0|Windtalkers is an awesome action picture and I recommend this to those who like action, war and Nicholas Cage (The Rock). <br /> <br />It is not as realistic as Flags of Our Fathers (where people complained about the lack of action) and far more realisitc than Die Hard. <br /> <br />Compared to what has been going on at Hollywood productions (releases) in the last few years I can recommend this film highly, as I like Black Hawk Down, We Were Soldiers and Behind Enemy Lines as well. All these movies have something in common and that is they are based on History. While Black Hawk Down and We Were Soldiers were more accurate to history than Behind Enemy Lines and Windtalkers, I can say that these films are worthy action pics. <br /> <br />Well done to John Woo, and please more where that came from. How about a John Woo Berlin/Germany film (1945) with Nicholas Cage?
0374105235|5.0|This book was a heartbreaking, inspirational, page-turner.  For the past two days, I have read it at every possible moment - on the bus to/from work, during my lunch break, while walking on the treadmill, etc...that's how good it was.  What shocked me was how insulated the U.S. was to what was happening in Sierra Leone less than a decade ago - I barely remember hearing about this when I got out of college in the mid-90s. <br /> <br />After reading this book, I have so much admiration for Ishmael Beah and his resilience.  His childhood was destroyed, he lost everything and was forced to witness and participate in unimaginable horrors, yet he emerged with an even stronger spirit.

B00005U11Z|5.0|I stayed away from Journey due to Steve Perry being out of the band.  Wow, Angeli (lead singer on the DVD) can sing as crisp as Perry with more volume.  His voice is very similiar. What was I thinking?  All Journey fans definately want to purchase this.  Very Entertaining performance by all the band.
B000NA77YO|5.0|This is by far one of the better greatest hits collections placed out in the last few years.  Sure, there are a few tracks that are always left off, but the \\"Heaven and Hell\\" crew's new tracks are right at where they left of with dehumanizer, and reminiscent of Heaven and Hell.  The part that makes this disc even better is the packaging.  Great Art work, and a nice interview over several pages.  Plus, the pricing for the first several weeks makes this very easy to afford and add to your collection. <br />My hopes are they finish the \\"greatest hits collections\\" series (1st was ozzy's year, now dio) with a Tony Martin (tagged with glenn hughes and Ian Gillan) greatest hits.  Sure there is Sabbath Stones, a nice tony martin year review, but I'd like to see a more comprehensive one.   <br /> <br />FYI <br />There is also a major chain that features the VH1 30 minute dvd interview \\"Hanging with Heaven and Hell\\".  informative and enlightening.  They all appear to have thier chemistry back.    <br /> <br />You will not be dissapointed.
0399243860|3.0|We checked this one out of the library after buying [[ASIN:039924509X My Very First Book of Numbers]]. Unfortunately, it's not quite as good. First of all, although black, white, pink, and brown are represented, the color orange is missing - how can you skip one of the secondary colors?! Secondly, at least in the copy we saw, the fire engine is a muddy color somewhere in between red and brown (and definitely does not match the bright red color square). Finally, it would have been nice if the colors had been arranged in the order of the spectrum rather than randomly. This really had potential, but fell short.
B00005JPMC|5.0|I have to admit I found the violence, which was a bit excessive, to be an integral part of the story. In Shooter, the good guys win in the end by a landslide! Not only do the good guys win, but they have to win! The mass murder that took place in the name of corporate & government power in \\"Ethiopia\\" can not be allowed to happen all over again in Ecuador! In Shooter you are, unfortunately, left only with black & white, life & death choices.<br /><br />While this is supposedly a work of fiction, Hollywood, in my opinion, just substituted Ethiopia for Nigeria, or perhaps, Cameroon!<br /><br />It's a simple fact: There are so many mercenary forces around the world for hire, they are even currently employed, in a huge way, to fight in Iraq against the insurgents! So it's not so far fetched that they are being used in very poor countries to get rid of tribal/indigenous people who are trying to stop large development projects, like an oil pipeline. I know I would get a bit testy if some outside force, in cooperation with my central government, was going to force me off my land and/or harm the environment that my family is dependent on for wholesome food and clean water! (For further information on on this complex subject, see the documentary - \\"Pipe Dreams\\" by Terri Hathaway or read anything by the late Nigerian activist Ken Saro-Wiwa.)<br /><br />But what does this have to do with the American justice system? I couldn't think of a more scathing indictment than when the U.S. Attorney General, himself, throws up his hands in the air and says there is nothing he can do! How can the most powerful U.S. law enforcement agency possibly stop American mercenaries in the employ of corporate and government interests working both inside and outside of the United States? In other words - when it comes to extreme human rights violations, the lofty U.S. Justice system is powerless, and only the story's hero has the courage, and ability, to stop these foul villains from committing further atrocities in the name of progress!<br /><br />What a commentary on American society!<br />[[ASIN:1842778110 Looting Africa: The Economics of Exploitation]]  [[ASIN:1870716221 Genocide in Nigeria]]  [[ASIN:1586420259 In the Shadow of a Saint: A Son's Journey to Understand His Father's Legacy]]me of progress!

B00005JPAO|1.0|Helen Mirren imitated Queen Elizabeth rather than BEING her.  This was a dull, boring movie, which gave us very little insight into the character of this woman.  I do not recommend this movie at all...I don't care what the Academy of Arts and Sciences says.  Don't bother buying it.
B00005ATZT|4.0|Hollywood has welcomed several great crime drama films over the years,and one of those films happens to be,by far,\\"The Fugitive\\". An interesting and entertaining adaptation of one America's most successful televsion shows,it is always great to see good television shows being adopted into the films--something that this film proves quite well.    Based off a 1960's television series,this film is based in Chicago. Here,Harrison Ford plays Richard Kimble,a man who happens to be very fortunate:he is a successful and respected surgeon,with a large amount of money,good friends,and a beautiful wife whom he has a wonderful marriage with,Helen(Sela Ward). For Richard Kimble,things could not be any better,and Kimble himself is happy with the way that life is working out for him.    But,one night,things change for Richard Kimble and his life--in a negative way. After Richard Kimble comes home one night,he discovers that his wife is being murdered by a one-armed man. And,despite the fact that Richard Kimble is able to put up a good battle against this one-armed man,he is not able to win. Bad turns to worse when \\"certain evidence\\" falsely shows that Richard Kimble is responsible for the murder of his wife,and leads to Kimble facing execution on death row.    However,all of a sudden,things change. Once the bus that is carrying Richard Kimble and his former prisoners to the Death Row that they are going to be executed at crashes and ends up on a train track,Richard Kimble is able to escape. Fortunately enough for Kimble,he is able to return to Chicago. From here,Richard Kimble takes advantage of the opportunities that he has to find the evidence that he needs in order to learn more detail about his wife's murder,and to prove his innocence to the United States Marshals and the Chicago Police. But,will Richard Kimble be able to succeed in this,especially with the tight watch that the Chicago Police and the United States Marshals have over Kimble,and an intelligent and obcessed U.S. Marshal named Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones)leading the investigation to find Kimble?? Only time will tell!!!!    While \\"The Fugitive\\" may be very hard to follow and requires close attention to be paid to it,it is still a really good film. The script for this film is as suspenseful as it is entertaining,and makes you wonder what will happen next,with good surprises coming along the way. This film also has a lot of creativity in it,and despite the fact that it is based off of a television show,does a good job at not recycling the show that it is based off of (it is worth noting that a large portion of the events in this film are different from the events that occured in the telvision show)and being original--but at the same,not too original.  Also,let me add that Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones do a perfect job at taking on the action in this film,in a manner that makes it entertaining and suitable,without pushing it a mile to being an action film. There is a lot of strong acting to be found here,as well. In Harrison Ford's performance of Richard Kimble,Ford portrays Kimble as a laid-back and intelligent man. He allows this film to have an appropriate amount of drama,balanced out by showing who Richard Kimble is as a person and Kimble's determination to prove his innoncence,while at the same time,bringing who needs to be brought to justice for his wife's murder. As for Tommy Lee Jones's performance of Samuel Gerard,Jones is brilliant in his performance. In his performance,Tommy Lee Jones provides the no-nonsence personality that he brought to the characters that he has portrayed in other films (the role of Agent K in the \\"Men in Black\\" films,the role of Travis Lehman in \\"Double Jeopardy\\",etc.),and allows this film to have suspense. At the same time,he allows this film's viewers to understand the current status of the both sides of the story that are depicted in this film. Those sides are the side of Richard Kimble,and the side of Samuel Gerard and the men who are assisting Gerard in the search for Kimble. Also,while you will not see Sela Ward throughout most of this film,Ward turns in a strong performance of Helen Kimble. In her scenes with Harrison Ford,Sela Ward provides a lot of compassion and chemistry. This is a contribution to this film being as good and interesting as it turned out to be. At the same time,it helps this film's viewers to take a walk in the mind of Richard Kimble,and know how Kimble feels as they watch Kimble solve the wife of his murder. All of this allows \\"The Fugitive\\" to fully come together as the good film that it is,and are good examples of why the film turned out to be as successful as it was.    The DVD for this film has a lot of good bonus features on it,as well. Here,you get a commentary that was conducted with Tommy Lee Jones and this film's director (Andew Davis),profiles of the lead actors in this film (Harrison Ford,Sela Ward,Tommy Lee Jones,Joe Pantoliano,Andreas Katsulas,and Jeroen Krabbe,as well as a profile of Andrew Davis),the list of the awards that found Tommy Lee Jones winning best supporting actor for his performance as Samuel Gerard in this film,as well as this film's theatrical trailer. These are all strong and worthwile bonus feautures. But,what really does justice for the bonus feautures here are these:\\"Introduction\\" (this finds Harrison Ford,Tommy Lee Jones,and Andrew Davis discussing the good memories that they have of making this film),\\"Derailed:Anatomy of a Train Wreck\\" (this discusses the scene in this film that feautures this film's famous train wreck scene,and how it was put together),and \\"On The Run With The Fugitive\\" (this discusses the making of this film,and provides a thorough behind-the-scenes look into the making of it). These are all excellent bonus feautures for any film that is represented on DVD,and give this film the recognition and respect that it deserves.    Overall,\\"The Fugitive\\" is an excellent film. If you enjoyed the television show that this film is based off of,and/or you are a large fan of crime drama films,\\"The Fugitive\\" is one film that you do not want to miss out on.
B00003CXC7|5.0|It is difficult to not fall in love with \\"Rear Window\\" starring James Stewart and Grace Kelly. The film is a witty and strong testament about voyeurism without venturing into dark territory. In the case of Rear Window it concerns a physically disabled photographer's desperation to peak out the window of his apartment into the lives of his neighbors.  His new hobby while unhealthy, is an amusing, sympathetic portrayal of Alfred Hitchcock's reoccurring theme of how voyeurism plays a role for the viewer in cinema.<br /><br />Everything works perfect, the cast, the story, the direction, even the cinematography. James Stewart as the protagonist L.B. \\"Jeff\\" Jefferies and Grace Kelly as his love interest Lisa Fremont have excellent chemistry together in the film along with a strong supporting cast.  The story is a clever, fresh, and funny execution of how the male gaze (as the camera lens) can function as a source of voyeur pleasure.  As the audience we are captivated in Jeff's life as he gazes through his camera to solve a murder mystery that happens across his apartment window.  Grace Kelly remains a heartfelt beauty, the woman in his life who's only desire is to divert Jeff's gaze away from the activity outside his apartment to herself.  Lisa represents Jeff's real world in which he is distracted away from by all that does not concern him.  Jeff's disability becomes a mental one as well as physical.<br /><br />The movie is a film that should be watched while you are laying down with your feet propped up at night when you have the chance.  In essence you as the viewer become Jeff, sitting back and relaxing as Hitchcock invites you into another world.  I love all of Hitchcock films. Rear Window is among his best achievements.  Simply Amazing.
0374105235|5.0|So how should we think of this book?   <br /> <br />Ishmael Beah displays great range of emotion: from his description of shocking atrocities (many carried out by the author himself and graphically described) to the tender feelings between him and his nurse, Esther, in the rehabilitation camp, and his relationship with his uncle and the family members he's united with in Freetown. <br /> <br />Think of this book as a great and important story. Beah shows how we strive mightily to hold on to our humanity--even in the midst of terrifying  conditions. And we can recover. How regrettable that we live in a world where so many blood curdling stories are taken for granted. This isn't a movie.  <br /> <br />In Ishmael's first speech about the horrors he experienced as a child soldier he reminds his audience that children have the resilience to outlive their sufferings. Ishmael's tale is a story of great hope--something very necessary given the present state of the world. How eloquent he is, and how beautiful his story is! <br /> <br />I was pleased to hear Ishmael Beah read from this book in person recently in Washington, D.C. It was a great literary experience.  <br /> <br />Beah is at his best in describing the events of village life before the terrible civil war. I found the scene where he and his father recited passages from Julius Caeser in his village especially moving. Similarly his description of the first time he comes upon the ocean, and his impressions of New York on his first arrival there. When Ishmael asks his chaperone why it's cold, he's told that it is winter. He knows the word \\"winter\\" from Shakespeare and decides to look it up again. <br /> <br />The Sierra Leone rebels and soldiers who commit unspeakable acts are people like us. Loss of moral compass and the ability to engage in brutality against others is not unique to Africa--it can happen to anyone.  <br /> <br />Ishmael Beah defies the usual stereotypes of victimhood. His is a magnificent talent. <br/> <br />He does not ask for pity or place blame. He simply tells us his story. He tells us that he comes from a tribe in Sierra Leone that is known for storytelling. It shows. <br />

B0000035E7|5.0|I am a 20 year old black kid and no one would expect me to listen to Nirvana, but i've been listening to them since 92', the first song I ever heard was smells like teen spirit, i remember the son of the family my mother worked for gave me the nevermind cd and I was blown away, I was only five or six but I loved the hell out of Nirvana. Bleach was given to me as a cassette by the same person and this would be Nirvana's foundation, the best album they ever made, every song is listenable without skipping, unlike incesticide or in utero. If you are just getting into Nirvana start here this is a classic because it has that raw punk-metal sound, school has to be the greatest song ever. There are few rockers such as Kurt and Marilyn Manson, who have the most rugged and violent voices, this is a true talent, you can feel Kurt's voice not just hear it. His voice is the greatest in rock if you ask me, from sing-songy, to scream, to violent howl, he made the best rock songs ever, from his voice to his guitar playing (oh my god), to the whole melody of the song + lyrics=perfection. He is and was the greatest because he had fans of all races and im proof of that, even though i didnt live in a suburban area I was the only kid in the \\"ghetto\\" listening to this and I've been a fan since 6 years old. If you dont have unplugged you should be arrested and sentenced to life. R.I.P Kurt.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|The series is awesome! When I started watching the series on TDC I expected to hear Sir David Attenborough narrating.  After all, he is a legend in the world of nature documentaries and a BBC staple. Weaver does a good job, but I can't wait to hear it with Sir David.  I'm so glad to have found this version and with more footage and a better price too! Three great reasons to buy this set! <br /> <br />The episode \\"Ice Worlds\\" is my favorite to date. The plight of the male Emperor penguins taking care of their eggs is especially heart-wrenching. It seems like a truly horrible exsistence for such a majestic animal.  Their waddle is funny too.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|A female journalist once took Frank Zappa to task for sexist humour.  He replied that if woman do stupid things, they need to take their lumps along with the rest of us.   <br /> <br />Many people on the left object to this movie because, well, they don't like taking their lumps.   Many people on the right love this movie because Team America seems to win.   <br /> <br />Frankly, NOBODY gets off scott free in this movie---except, perhaps the cockroach who plays Kim Jong Il.   <br /> <br />When it's mimicked by a puppet, anyone's behaviour looks stupid. Parker/Stone have little patience for the stupidities of our time (but you knew that already).   Using puppets let them give everyone their satirical lumps in one fell swoop.  <br /> <br />The DVD set is worth it just for the making-of shorts.  Parker and Stone wax lyrical about how much they hate actors (another good reason to use puppets or animation, no?) and it makes their jokes about \\"powerful acting\\" in the movie that much more funny.   <br />
B00005JLEX|5.0|Theres not much to say about the dvds, they have bloopers, and extra material about each episode.  What is important is that you should shop around.  Target sells the first 5 seasons for $20!
B000N6U0DS|5.0|This movie was obviously inspiring in that it pictures a father and son coming through whatever is thrown at them - including each others' stress and consequent temper flare ups - and becoming stronger from it and eventually finding success. I think it was also thought-provoking at least to me in that seeing the main character find and make opportunity in very strained circumstances makes me wonder what I let go by from complacency. I loved his searching the meaning of the words of Jefferson on pursuing happiness. I think revisiting our founding fathers' thoughts and intentions is a good exercise for discovering a new or renewed way of looking at things that might work despite seeming impossibilities.
B000002OVJ|5.0|\\"Live at Leeds\\" was one of the best live rock LPs of the 1970s, and is currently available in competing expanded formats with different tracks. All of them have the original \\"Live at Leeds\\" LP as their core, but differ in the amount of extra tracks from the concert added to the CD. The current CD is the best value for the money; the longest version of \\"Leeds\\" is a two-CD set that includes a complete performance of \\"Tommy.\\" Call me a heretic, but I could care less if I never hear \\"Tommy\\" again. As for the rest of the \\"Leeds\\" show, I simply can't get enough of it. <br /> <br />\\"Leeds\\" features the Who at their ferocious best. It sounds almost nothing like their studios albums of the time. Instead, the fast and brutal playing lays the groundwork for virtually every heavy riff-based rhythm-guitar player to follow in the Who's footsteps. Try and track down the original versions of Mose Allison's \\"Young Man Blues\\" and Eddie Cochran's \\"Summertime Blues\\" and then listen to the blistering versions on this CD. The Who played like there was no tomorrow at the Leeds concert, and a very good argument could be made that this is one of the first true punk records from England. An equally good observation is that the arrangements on this CD are not too distantly related from what Jimmy Page did with Led Zeppelin on their second album. <br /> <br />\\"Leeds\\" is the CD many of us will remember the Who by, long after their many disappointing live reunion CDs (not to mention their increasingly weak studio LPs) are forgotten. This CD is proof of the power that rock and roll can have.
0140074317|5.0|This book is a wonderful book, but it has to be read in the original hardback edition.  The hardback edition is printed in two colors of ink, and this is integral to the story.

B000002KO1|5.0|I'd trust Chrissie Hynde driving; in fact, I want her behind the wheel in the driver's seat.  I believe she'd get me there fast and with a minimal amount of wasted time or fuel.  There aren't many people I'd feel comfortable relinquishing control to, but Chrissie is one of them.  Finally a band came along that has the scorching \\"raw power\\" of THE STOOGES, and the in-control Pop song writing ability of THE BEATLES, melds the two, and lays a cornerstone upon which the next 10 years of Rock rests, unmoved until the Grunge movement a decade later.  It had to take an American woman in an English group to marry these influences (and later, literally marry Jim Kerr of SIMPLE MINDS, after having leader of the KINKS Ray Davies' baby.  She later divorced Kerr).  With tongue-in-cheek, I must inquire: how could a band fronted by a girl get it all so right?  This album does not feature Chrissie Hynde, but rather the band she founded (though she is the genius who wrote most of these tunes including the sizzling \\"The Phone Call,\\" scorchers \\"The Wait,\\" \\"Up The Neck\\" and \\"Tattooed Love Boys,\\" the classic  \\"Brass In Pocket,\\" and the unforgiving \\"Mystery Achievement.\\")  The PRETENDERS truly were pretenders, in this case, to the throne of rock n' roll, vacant since ELVIS' death, the demise of THE BEATLES, and the soft phase of THE ROLLING STONES . . . and Chrissie Hynde is the Queen.  For a moment, the PRETENDERS were the greatest Rock n' Roll band in the world.  Also, I must correct myself, since the PRETENDERS could get away with referencing the \\"Space Invaders\\" game on the song of that title on this awesome debut album.  It is the record's weakest moment without doubt, and that's saying a lot for this incredibly strong, superb album (that \\"Space Invaders\\" track is not composed by Hynde).  My self-correction references David Bowie's timely 1977 LOW album and my Amazon review of same, a record which uses some of the same sound of that game 3 years prior to this release.<br />Loaded with strong rockers, hot pretension, and superb songwriting, this is one of Rock's best records by a band that came out of nearly nowhere.th strong rockers, hot pretension, and superb songwriting, this is one of Rock's best records by a band that came out of nearly nowhere.

074356619X|5.0|Since buying this audiobook less than a week ago, I've already listened to it a couple of times.  This book will teach you the Law of Attraction, which states that your thoughts, words, and actions ultimately determine what happens in your life.  It has completely changed the way I think.  Before listening to this audiobook, my favorite saying was \\"Life sucks and then you die\\".  I always knew instinctively that this was the wrong attitude, but now I know WHY it is, and the damage it brings.  This book will teach you that your thoughts and words are THINGS, and they have energy, tremendous energy. <br /> <br />All of this is, of course, obvious.  However, The Secret will not only teach you the importance of thinking positively, but how to do it the right way, which is not so obvious (for example, you DON'T want to say things like \\"I'm not going to spill this water\\".  Believe it or not, this is actually a negative statement that just may cause you to spill the water.)  Needless to say, I'm now much more aware of my thoughts, and when I find myself thinking negatively, I'm able to catch myself, and change what I'm thinking, which has had a profound effect on my life in the short time I've been listening to The Secret. <br /> <br />For example, my attitude has completely changed.  I now go through the day much happier, and my outlook has improved dramatically.  Good things have also begun happening.  Last night, I went out for dinner, and got treated like royalty.  Our waiter actually held the door open for us as my girlfriend and I left the restaurant.  This has never happened to us before.  The service we used to receive was usually disappointing.   <br /> <br />My stocks have also gone up, when they used to go down most of the time (I've replaced my old favorite saying with \\"The stock market is my bank account\\").  I realize that these things cannot be definitively attributed to the techniques taught in this audiobook, however, as I explain below, it's nearly impossible to do such a thing.  But I know how I think, and I know how I feel, and I know that this vast improvement is from the teachings in this book. <br /> <br />To the skeptics out there, who think that this book is just a bunch of New Age fluff, you're listening to it the wrong way.  This is not a science textbook.  If you're looking for facts and figures, you won't find them here.  It's virtually impossible to quantify one's quality of life, or happiness.  I would also say that I'm generally not a fan of self help or motivational books.  I work in the IT field, and I'm a very logical, well-grounded person.  The fact that I would go out and buy this audiobook and rave about it speaks volumes. <br /> <br />In addition to teaching positive thinking and the principles of the Law of Attraction, this book will also teach you practical techniques that are applicable to using The Secret in your personal life, such as visualization, meditation, positive affirmations, and developing a sense of gratitude for all you have.  Trust me, if you listen to this book with an open mind, it will completely change your life, and the way you think about things.  This book is destined to become one of the self-help classics, in the same echelon as Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill, and How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I highly recommend this show.  Its fascinating--and worth watching alone just to see David Bowie's hair and hear him sing!!  But perhaps its because its a childhood memory for me!
B000002KE2|5.0|\\"wheels of confusion\\" opens this experimental album from the Sabbath boys.  It's such a lengthy song that goes here, there and everywhere.  I love the final few minutes of the song where it turns into a 3-minute intense guitar jam.  The first part of the song is more along the lines of typical Sabbath sludgery that reminds me of an airplane ride, hot-air balloon ride, and a roller coaster ride, all wrapped in one!  This song is also the first time in Sabbath history where a WEAK guitar riff is played behind a MEMORABLE Ozzy vocal melody.  Hard to believe, but true! <br /> <br />I honestly don't understand the people who believe this album marks Sabbath's experimental period into progressive rock.  Really?  Didn't they do that with \\"hands of doom\\" and the Sabbath melody on the first album?  Sure sounds like it. <br /> <br />\\"tomorrow's dream\\" is supposed to be one of Sabbath's hits.  Why don't we hear it on the radio then?  Dunno.  Let's all make fun of \\"changes\\" for being a silly Ozzy ballad.  Nah, it's a good song.  It's just a pretty ordinary ballad, and that's the only thing going against it.  Are those mellotrons I hear in the background?  If so, that makes the song better.  I love those things. <br /> <br />Just what the HECK is the point of \\"FX\\"?  It sounds like in high school when I used to flap a metal ruler up and down on the side of a table to get the teachers attention.  However, immediately after this song, it sounds like Deep Purple's \\"woman from tokyo\\" is about to play, but it's actually \\"supernaut\\".  A song that reminds me of soaring to the moon!   Apparently it reminds Ozzy of the same thing. <br /> <br />\\"snowblind\\" is a pretty song about making snow angels, having family snowball fights, happily building snowmen... okay, it's not about that at all.  It's about drugs.  Drugs are not for children.  This is a really good song because the way the guitar riff is played, it actually *feels* like you're doing drugs just by listening to the way you can feel sensations in the music.  Strange, but true. <br /> <br />\\"cornucopia\\" brings out a VERY heavy and sewer-like maze melody that goes all over the place.  There's a really tasty blues rhythm somewhere in the middle of this song, right after Ozzy sings about going insane.  This song is so good *I* just might go insane.   <br /> <br />\\"laguna sunrise\\" is a pretty instrumental that reminds me of bright yellow images in the morning sky, and the next track is called \\"st. vitus dance\\" and, maybe I'm wrong, but I think the song is about relationship problems within the band.  The track that really catches my attention is \\"under the sun/everyday comes and goes\\".  Perhaps starting out with some of the heaviest riffs on record, it soon progresses into something much deeper.  Ozzy starts singing about how it's important to just live your life and not let anyone interfere with your thoughts and not to ever change who you are inside.  Ozzy must have been having a bad day when this song was recorded because he sounds very angry and serious and determined for us to pay attention to the lyrics.   <br /> <br />Overall, you can't go wrong with this if you like Master of Reality type heaviness.
0618154043|5.0|This book is for those folks who read the Lord of the Rings all of the way through, including the appendices. It collects several different stories that do not really fit into a narrative of their own. Yet they're in a more cohesive state than the Silmarillion, which was also released posthumously. If you like to read all that you can of J.R.R. Tolkiens creation you'll want this book. It adds extra depth to the underlying themes in the Lord of the Rings.
B000002KDO|4.0|Probably the heaviest album on the early 70's.  Oh heck, who am I kidding?  It IS the heaviest album of the early 70's.  It's like the band members wanted to see how heavy they can go.  Most people were probably thinking back then that it would be impossible to make an album heavier than Paranoid, but then, the band DOES it.  How?  Why?  I don't know.  Talent, an urge to be different, just for fun.  Who KNOWS why they did it.   <br /> <br />It begins with \\"sweet leaf\\" COUGH COUGH COUGH DU-DUN DU-DU-DUN De DO DO, DU-DUN DU-DU-DUN De DO DO.  Yeah, I can't stop singing that simple guitar riff that seems to repeat endlessly.  It's funny because Sabbath has never really created a guitar riff repeat THIS much before.  It's a good song too.  \\"Oh yeah baby!\\" <br /> <br />\\"after forever\\" is kind of boring with power chords and a weak song overall.  The lyrics are amazing to some people, but to me, they're just \\"alright\\"  \\"children of the grave\\" rules.  I love the lyrics \\"show the world that love is still alive you must be brave, before you children of today are children of the grave, yeah!\\"  Some people say it's been ripped off from the \\"immigrant song\\" (Zeppelin) but I don't know.  They're both good songs in their own ways, and need to be respected as separate beasts. <br /> <br />The second side is my favorite.  \\"solitude\\" is so pretty.  Everyone says it's Ozzy singing this track, but the dude sounds like Bill Ward to me (the drummer).  Maybe I'm wrong.  I've been wrong before.  More times than I've been right, in fact. lol <br /> <br />\\"into the void\\" is the greatest pounding dose of sludge that reminds me of the Grand Canyon.  I can just picture myself turning into a giant creature and pounding my way through the desert.  \\"lord of this world\\" is pretty cool, with a guitar riff that seems to pull me in as it pounds my brains out. <br /> <br />Overall, a solid effort.  Worth owning.
B000002MFN|5.0|Madonna sells EROTICA as she starts a one-women sexual revolution. \\"Erotica\\" is Madonna's defining work of art, and in a body of work that has lasted twenty-five years that's no small accomplishment. This album came out at a perfect time in America when society was very sexually repressed and homophobic. Maybe this was a gift from Madonna to enlighten the masses. Why is this CD so perfect? Because it mixes just the right blend of pop, dance, and R&B to form what
B000002KHH|5.0|It's a mystery to me that a band so heavy, so lyrically satanic and intense, and so musically interesting (by hard rock standards) actually existed.  There was a point in my life where I could have sworn Black Sabbath existed JUST for lil' ol' me.   <br /> <br />Paranoid is an album everyone knows.  Every one of the eight songs will surprise you in terms of quality.  \\"war pigs\\" is famous for those two guitar riffs pounding back and forth, and for the war lyrics (which are quite interesting if you listen to them- this band was good at combining fictional lyrics with real life situations to tell a story).   <br /> <br />The title track is a song everyone has heard, though I admit, I didn't know who did the song until I was about 15 years old.  Silly me and my slow mind.  \\"iron man\\" needs no introduction.  None whatsoever.  Just listen to that crunchy riff and absorb the fuzz. <br /> <br />\\"planet caravan\\" reminds me of hiding out in the woods during Vietnam War at nighttime.  It's a really quiet and jazzy song- entirely different from the rest of the album.  \\"rat salad\\" is a nice 90 second drum jam.  \\"fairies wear boots\\" features EVERY little thing I like about hard rock- jazzy, bluesy and melodic guitar playing, messy guitar solos, drumming played whenever, and a loud and fast main vocal melody.  I love singing this song (dun DUN dun dun dun dun DUN, dun dun dun DUN dun dun duuuun).   <br /> <br />\\"electric funeral\\" is a spooky song that reminds me of laser balls for some reason.  Giant laser balls floating through trees in a dark forest.  I must be thinking about \\"orbs\\" from a famous ghost haunting story about a family who video taped strange things happening in the woods right in front of their house, and a giant orb that looked like a bright white laser ball floated by.  \\"hand of doom\\" is such a great song.  It goes through a series of interesting twists and turns before eventually returning to the main theme.  It builds and progresses- what a great song.  I can sing that middle section a million times.  What a great album, in fact.  Let's do the right thing and BUY IT NOW!
0060976624|4.0|This is an entertaining film, worth watching. My main comment is that while called a satire, it serves as a very powerful public relations piece for the tobacco industry. Deep down, I think that tobacco money or influence was a big part of the reason why the film was made. If not, it is an unfortunate coincidence that the film is a strong criticism for anti-smoking activists and a strong justification for what the tobacco industry has done. And even worse, the film implies that the tobacco industry has been tamed by law suits and regulations, while in truth, the economic strength of the industry is greater than ever. While the film indicated that the \\"bad guys\\" have been punished, in fact, the industry boomed after the tobacco settlement. And the audience comes to love the man who advocates \\"trying yourself\\", \\"not being told what to do\\", and \\"choice\\" for a product that continues to increase nicotine in cigarettes even as it pretends to warn people of the dangers. As a film, this is very good. As a propaganda piece, it is a real work of art. Watch it and notice how you feel at the end. Who do you like? Who do you ridicule? If the film is done well, those feelings have been crafted by the story. The film is a real success, but I am sorry that this is the success that is sought. This is a film that promotes the tobacco industry.
B000002KET|5.0|Wow, Black Sabbath finally turned into Pink Sabbath!  Nah, they just went soft*er* with this album.  Yes, it's entirely true from everyone who has commented on this album that almost 80% of it is completely unlike what Sabbath has done before in terms of raw, relentless heaviness.  Yes, it's probably the wimpiest album from a hard rock band in the history of rock and roll.  But you know what?  Experiments are interesting, especially when it's coming from a hard rock band, because it's fun to see if a rock band who stuck to one or two formulas for years can somehow change and spice up their style, and have it all come across as believable and successful.  It worked because the public liked it.  They still do, years later. <br /> <br />The title song rules.  I believe Ozzy's angry emotions are some of the most believable ever.  I love the lyrics \\"and you don't care, if you don't see, again the LIGHTS OF DAY\\".  It really feels like Ozzy is giving a speech at some really important grand event.  Then, in the blink of an eye, the melody switches to something much lighter with acoustic guitars.  All this is fine and good, and then at the very end of the song, it's like Hell has finally reared its ugly head, and the song turns as dark and heavy as a hard rock band was capable of back then.  One of Sabbath's best songs for sure. <br /> <br />Wow, I really talked about the title song didn't I!  \\"a national acrobat\\" follows a similar formula, except there's a blues melody at the end of the song instead of something really heavy.  Also, the first half of the song reminds me of those little bubble-hooded cars the Jetsons fly around in.  It must be the space rock cartoon freak coming out of me.    <br /> <br />\\"fluff\\" is a delicate and beautiful instrumental.  It reminds me of Elvis Presley's \\"I can't help falling in love with you\\".  It's really good with guitars, and piano keys that seem to jam softly in the background.   <br /> <br />Oh yeah, \\"sabbra cadabra\\" RULES.  A fast-paced blues song that turns into some evil mystical adventure with Ozzy screaming \\"LOVELY LAY-LAY-LAY-LADY, she don't tell ME no LIES!\\"  The song is personally interesting for closing with a fine piece of jamming ability that might remind you of either Jethro Tull or Chicago.  I never would guesses Sabbath would try something like this.  They did, and it works!  Did I just say guesses?  I mean guessed.  I also meant to put the word \\"have\\" in front of it.   <br /> <br />\\"killing yourself to live\\" marks a return to the dark and serious Ozzy from the title song and \\"under the sun/everyday comes and goes\\" from Volume 4.  Pay attention to the meaningful lyrics.  Ozzy wants you to.  Wow, what the heck is \\"who are you?\\"  It's a great Who song, but this isn't the same thing at all.  This is like Marvin the Martian visiting Mars, and his friends are following right behind him.  The synths are either going to be really appealing or really annoying to you.  Guess what- they're good to me.  Yeah, it didn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that one. :) <br /> <br />\\"looking for today\\" is a pretty song with a pretty melody and pretty flowers blowing in the wind.  I love the lyrics \\"the pain begins to eat your pride, you can't believe in anything you knew, when was the last time that you cried\\".  Emotional vocals, and wonderful lyrics.  Finally \\"spiral architect\\" is memorable for its spinning 'round and 'round vocal melody, and landing safely on another planet chorus (but not Mars- that's Marvin's base).  I heard this melody before... Earthworm Jim!  The intro is especially good.  It's like a countdown to a rocket launching before the orchestration comes in. <br /> <br />Own this album.
B000MG1ZG0|5.0|If you want the same version of Morrison Hotel you had way back when, you might avoid this version. You might be better off with the remastered edition from 1999. But if you want to hear this classic Doors album with some unused vocals and instruments mixed back in, pick up this latest release from Rhino/Elektra. If you're a longtime fan you'll probably want to have both in your collection. I have been digging these in a big way. Highly recommended!!!
1932100660|5.0|Hands down the most important book I've ever read.  Completely changed my views on nutrition and health.<br /><br />Dr. Campbell does a great job of interpreting mountains of information and research into plain English.  Most of what he said completely surprised me, but left me excited about making major changes to my diet rather than feeling like I was going to be deprived.  My husband and I have been eating healthier for about a month now, and while I haven't completely gone vegan, I've shed a few pounds thanks to drastically cutting back on dairy products (I already ate very little meat before reading the book).<br /><br />When I finished the book (and it didn't take long because it was fascinating), I walked away feeling like I had been given the real facts for the first time in my life.  I thank Dr. Collins and his son for having the guts to take a stand and speak the truth in spite of all of the opposition from the meat and dairy industries and the not-so-open-minded and $$$influenced$$$ medical establishment.
B000MCIBB6|5.0|OK.....What we have here is a failure for some folks to have done their homework. This is the 40th Anniversary \\"remix\\" of Waiting for the Sun. It's supposed to be a bit different from the original. In fact ALL of the Doors studio albums have been not only remastered, but remixed. Bonus tracks added as well. If you want the Doors sounding like the albums you grew up with, then pick up the last set of remastered CDs from 1999. If you want killer sound quality, bonus tracks and a new take on these classics pick the 40th Anniversary mixes on Rhino/Elektra. If you're a big fan like me, you'll have them both. At any rate, these editions are great! They are the same you would have gotten if you bought the \\"Perecptions\\" box set (no DVD 5.1 mixes here or video content though). Don't be bummed out, just shop wisely and enjoy!! Once again, these editions are a must for longtime fans.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This video was both eye-opening and enjoyable.  I fascinated through the entire thing.  I've tried to share this with family, but unfortunately they've been less-than-receptive to the idea that global warming is happening.  How anyone can think otherwise after watching this documentary was obviously asleep through the entire thing!
B000N3STBQ|5.0|Thank God that this CD wasn't another victim of the \\"loudness war\\" that has recently permeated the CD mastering industry. The dynamics are well preserved and there is very little clipping of the audio. Those who are afraid that this CD would sound like \\"Playing the Angel\\" or the two Singles compilation need not worry. The engineers showed restraint with this one.  <br /> <br />In addition to the \\"careful\\" remaster, there's a nice HOUR LONG documentary included with this CD. <br /> <br />This one is definitely a very worthy purchase.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|I wasn't expecting to enjoy this film, much less laugh or be moved to an occasional tear. Honestly, Jack Black's face on the cover screamed: \\"Not in a million years!\\" Seriously, Jack Black, romantic comedy? Seriously, Jack Black - seriously? Well, there are four stars at the top of this review, so did Jack work? No, he didn't. I have a feeling that the filmmakers were aware of this as well because his screen time was ¼ that of his other co-stars. <br /> <br />Yet, this is a four-star review. So what worked? <br /> <br />This is a difficult movie to compartmentalize. Per the story line, it should be split equally into two parts. Amanda (Cameron Diaz) is a movie-trailer producer who lives in LA and has broken up with her boyfriend. She's looking for an escape. Iris (Kate Winslet) is in love with someone she works with, yet he has just become engaged, much to her unfortunate surprise. She, as well, needs an escape and lists her cozy Surrey fairy-tale-like cottage on a home-exchange board. Amanda sees it, is intrigued, and they agree to an immediate swap. The very next day, in fact. This seems a bit pushed, considering the time difference between California and England, and the suddenness, especially on Amanda's part, but it's easily set aside. <br /> <br />One would think that we have two stories. Yet we don't - at least, not in screen time. Granted, the movie is long (2:15), but it isn't until one hour and eleven minutes that anything of consequence happens for Iris in L.A. Prior to that, quite a bit has been going on in Surrey. Very oddly disjointed. <br /> <br />Amanda is disturbed in the middle of the night (which for her would be dinnertime) by a loud pounding on the fairy-tale-cottage's door. It's Iris's brother, Graham, in what can only be called a spot-on Jude Law performance. Because of the quick swap, many things were forgotten, such as Iris's brother who often comes over to sleep off a good drunk if he spends too much time at the pub, and that Amanda has aboyfriend who will be sending people (Jack Black and his girlfriend) over to pick up his stuff. <br /> <br />I'll sum it up: stuff happens between Amanda and Graham. Graham isn't quite the man he seems, and for once in the movies that's a good thing! There's a scene when Amanda surprisingly visits Graham at his house and they spend time in a, well, tent, that screams of the magic of Finding Neverland. Amanda and Graham have something together, and it's obvious to everyone. It must have been obvious to the filmmakers, because they seemed to grab a bit more than 2/3 of the total screen time. <br /> <br />When we flip back to Iris in LA, it feels jolting, but Iris is growing as well. Iris, we know from observation, cries frequently. Amanda, we know from being told, hasn't cried since she was fifteen. There's some irony in that they have swapped houses. Perhaps the affect of Iris's presence will loosen up Amanda; perhaps Amanda will have a cooling influence on Iris. <br /> <br />Sadly, only one of these plays through. <br /> <br />Iris develops two special relationships in L.A. One is with a ninety-year old writer of many Hollywood screenplays. The other is with Miles (Jack Black). Guess which is more moving and believable? <br /> <br />With Kate Winslet in the movie, it seems impossible to say this, but I will: if only she hadn't been in it. The filmmakers (I'm using this generally - who knows whose decision it was) chose to relegate her to a supporting role, when she should have shared the leading female role with Cameron Diaz (odd that her ninety-year-old friend, Arthur played well by Eli Wallach says nearly the same thing to her). Iris's L.A. story line could have been more believable, and it could have involved someone other than Jack Black. Let's keep him in Nacho Libre roles forever. He didn't belong here. <br /> <br />But oh, how touching and moving it was when the film swept back to Surrey, to Amanda and Graham. This was their film. Both characters saw real, concrete and believable growth. For everything they brought to this film, it gets four stars from me - someone who was sure they would dislike the film going in. <br /> <br />(Regarding the title of the review: I'm a guy.) <br />
B000K7UBTI|3.0|This is the third direct-to-dvd effort from Marvel/Lions Gate, and rather than giving us another superhero team, we get an origin story treatment on everyone's favourite shellhead. An ancient evil called the Mandarin has been unleashed, and only Tony Stark can stop it before it destroys the world.<br /><br />I like this one better than the two Ultimate Avengers efforts, though it's still lacking in certain respects. On the positive side, I like how the film doesn't feel compelled to show us the modern Iron Man armor until late into the movie. It's a gutsy move, and ultimately makes me respect the character history just a little more. The Mandarin is also an interesting choice for a first villain in that old 'science vs. magic' way. The elementals make for cool visuals.<br /><br />Really though, I just don't find myself caring for Tony Stark much. The script's attempts at giving him character come off as forced, and overall I just found Stark and his problems kind of bland. It seems to be the trend with all of Marvel's animated features, especially compared to the stronger DC Justice League material. When the character is weak, the story is weak. And when the story is weak, the bland animation doesn't help much either.<br /><br />The DVD comes with some featurettes that cover Iron Man's history, and also some interviews from the creative team. This is worth a rental for all comic book fans at the very least, but it lacks the re-watchability of Hellboy, Justice League, and the 90s X-Men/Spider-Man shows.
B000H0MKOC|1.0|because it is on fire in my backyard! Sorry, not into the feel angry because the tobacco companies are making a lot of money! When hollywood stops producing movies glamourizing thugs and drug dealing maybe then they should start trying to convict others of their bad decisions. Until then just keep your opinion to yourself! Junk movie!
B0000046KM|5.0|There are plenty of great female vocalists, technically \\"perfect\\" divas, out there, in all musical genres, but what the great majority lack are the genius, timelessness, artistic truth, and stylistic individuality that Shirley Horn cannot help but consistently exhibit. Her death last year notwithstanding, I couldn't possibly use anything but the present tense in referring to Horn's musical contribution. Samuel Chell's (the first) review corroborates my devotion to Here's To Life far more eloquently than ever I could. You do her legacy a tremendous service, Sir. <br /> <br />If the number of stars one grants to a work of art reflects the desirability of that work, I encourage all devotees of Here's To Life who are not acquainted with her 1997 masterpiece, Loving You, to get acquainted immediately. It will surely be the best \\"From $3.99\\" purchase in the \\"new and used\\" bin you will ever make. The album currently has but seven reviews, which is shameful, the first one a reprehensible two-star injustice that is repeated no less than THREE more times, reducing the overall average to four. If you already know this magnificent album PLEASE, join the rest of us, all of who have granted it five, and write a review to bump up the average! Mr. Chell, where are you? <br />
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Toby Stephens, to my taste, is the perfect Mr. Rochester.  True to character, he's certainly not \\"pretty\\" and he is gruff and brooding.  But many \\"Jane\\" versions have the ferocious, unattractive boss bullying the quiet governess, and when she speaks up in his presence her tone sounds offended and resentful--and the audience is left wondering what the heck the girl sees in this guy.  NOT this version.  Here we see the humour behind the dialogue.  When the characters argue, it's more like the teasing banter of equals instead of plain old bickering.  We see that Mr. Rochester definitely respects Jane, and she respects herself enough to hold her own with him.   <br /> <br />And this Mr. Rochester certainly isn't gorgeous--but he IS sexy. Though nothing \\"happens\\" when Jane rescues Mr. Rochester from a fire, the \\"chemistry\\" (read:  sexual tension) that occurs between the two main characters is incredible.  Toby Stephens is truly \\"hot\\" in that scene, with his shirt unbuttoned, silhouetted by the firelight.  Suddenly he's transformed from being mean, cynical, and unattractive to someone quite beautiful, vulnerable, and gentle.  Jane clearly sees this transformation, and we see her transform as well--she glows in the next scene, until she decides she had just been \\"imagining things\\" and tries to be plain and sensible again.  And of course we learn later that her calm sense and sanity are very attractive to Mr. Rochester--and why.    <br /> <br />This is a story I will want my daughter to learn about, once she is old enough.  One thing I always loved about the book \\"Jane Eyre\\" and its author is the fact that they dealt with things that we tend to think of as \\"modern\\" problems all those many years ago.  Bronte's brother struggled with a drug addiction and the book's characters struggle with the temptation of extra-marital relations.  In a world of divorces and affairs and people living together out of wedlock, it's hard for a \\"modern\\" person to imagine why Jane wouldn't simplyhave run off with Mr. Rochester to live somewhere else.  Who would have known??  SHE would have known, of course, not to mention the Higher Power in Whom she steadfastly believed.  Plus, the characters aren't flawlessly lovely fashion models and movie stars--they are ordinary.  Yet people love them for themselves, not for their superficial appearances.  In a world of shallow Disney Princesses and bombshells created by plastic surgery, young girls should have more heroines like Jane--passionate heroines who also possess independence, intelligence, morality, virtue, substance, and sense.
B000MNP2K8|5.0|Casino Royale is by far the greatest of the Bond films. This is a \\"get back to the basics\\" film, that features only the core elements of the oringinal films. This is a great buy!
B000FC2FVA|5.0|I dont know how they exactly did it but this band crafted a nearly perfect gem of pop songs.  There's some punk and 80's influences but the band makes music that certainly stands on its own.  There's also a mature sense of irony in several of the songs that makes replays of the CD fun if you're older than 16.  Very impressive singing in a \\"rock/pop\\" style.  The studio mixing brings out the strengths of the band.
B000NA2776|5.0|I heard \\"Grace Kelly\\" playing while I was browsing for new music and thought to myself that I really had to get this new CD. Iam not disappointed! I love European pop music for it's refreshing, playful sounds and hope that this CD gets good circulation in the U.S. As for myself, I intend to share this CD with all of my friends in the hope that they too have an appreciation for good, inventive music. Yes, Mika's sounds are reminiscent of Queen and the Beatles, but I loved them too, and who can blame Mika for having them as influences. Despite the partial mimicry, however, I think that Mika's talent is evident and that their music can stand on its own too feet. <br /> <br />
B00092ZAO0|5.0|I feel kind of strange writing this review.  I have already reviewed the CD of this version of \\"Das Rheingold.\\"<br />However, the DVD adds an additional element--the visual.  As noted in my review of the CD, this is a very fine version of this opera in terms of the quality of the cast, the singing, and the orchestra.  The DVD adds to the mix the visual element of Patrice Chereau's production.  A few comments about some of the things to note:<br /><br />The beginning is nice, as the camera moves up the road toward the Bayreuth Theater, where the performance is to take place.<br /><br />The Giants are well done and, indeed, loom over the gods.  This adds a nice element that the CD, of course, could not capture.<br /><br />The descent of Wotan and Loge to Nibelheim is nicely done.<br /><br />The hydroelectric dam at the beginning, where the Rhinemaidens care for the gold, does not convince me at all.  However, the liner notes discuss this briefly but ably.  Each viewer will have to decide if this works.<br /><br /> The magnificent music, \\"The Entrance of the Gods into Valhalla,\\" rings out and the visual depiction is interestingly done.<br /><br />In terms of the players, the one who stands out for me is Heinz Zednik as Loge.  The clever god is critical to retrieving the stolen Rhinegold, taken by the dwarf Alberich (who outwitted the Rhinemaidens).  His appearance is compelling, his voice works well, and his ironic perspective sets him off from the other gods.<br /><br />So, in the end, this is a fine depiction of Chereau's vision.  It allows the viewer to evaluate this version of the \\"Ring.\\"
B000B8QEYC|3.0|but I was disappointed with this CD. I have loved all the previous original Enya CD's. This one left me feeling flat.  Maybe I'd best stay will the previous ones.  I thought that the songs that were attributed to other authors weren't as good.  And in fact I didn't realize that they were other authors until after listening to the CD, I read the entire information to see what was going on.  I'll listen to it a couple more times to see if it \\"grows\\" on me, but I'm not looking forward to it.
B00002428O|5.0|Dead Can Dance's third album is arguably their masterpiece. Even though they continued to explore some of this album's sonic elements in future recordings, they never quite equaled the consistent excitement and richness featured here. Clocking in at a terse 39 minutes, the album delivers a complex and thematically integrated aural tapestry that stands up favorably in comparison to many classic works of orchestra and opera. <br /> <br />Having said all this, if you are a fan of their later work, when they incorporated more world music, drumming, and acoustic pop styles, you may possibly find this album not to your taste. It can be slow to grab the listener - the pace is generally deliberate and stately, and it took repeated listenings on my part to really appreciate the genius of the work. <br /> <br />Comprised of the duo of Lisa Gerrard and Brendan Perry, Dead Can Dance on this album took the approach of dividing it evenly between the two principals, with the first four tracks featuring Brendan, and the final four showcasing Lisa. By this time in their career, DCD had completely abandoned the 80s new wave roots evident in their two previous albums, in favor of a sound much closer to opera or chamber music than to mainstream pop. The overall tone is archaic and ominous, with sepulchral backing choruses, chilling Bulgarian-style wailing vocals from Lisa, chiming bells, moody strings, and dreamy, soaring vocals from Brendan.  <br /> <br />Brendan's opener Anywhere Out of This World echoes and surpasses the mood of Enigma of the Absolute from their previous album, building to a shimmering climax. This then shifts to the dark and hypnotic instrumental Windfall, one of the best tracks on the album, followed by what is arguably the weakest track, In The Wake of Adversity, which establishes a brooding mood but never really goes anywhere with it. Brendan achieves his pinnacle on his final track, Xavier, a mythic tale of tragedy delivered over a deep soundscape of keyboardsand climaxing in soaring romantic strings. <br /> <br />If Brendan's first half of the album is inspiring, Lisa's second half is dazzling. Her ethereal vocals were made for this kind of orchestral arrangement, and she displays a remarkable range on these four tracks, from spine-chilling operatic declamation on Dawn of the Iconoclast, to wailing middle eastern diva on Cantara, to angelic multi-tracked chorus on Summoning of the Muse, and finally to the amazing showcase of Persephone, which finds her running the gamut from gutteral alto to sweet soprano.  <br /> <br />Those who like the sound of this album may want to check out Lisa's later solo work, The Mirror Pool, which also uses some orchestral arrangements, as well as her amazing collaboration with Irish classical composer Patrick Cassidy, Immortal Memory.
B00005JPCF|1.0|I don't think I've ever hated a movie as much as I hated this.  Heavy-handed, all over the place with the message it was trying to convey, and just plain stupid.  I also have a problem with a movie that advertises as a light little romp about dancing penguins that veers into \\"Save the World from Humans\\" junk.  It was like Sybil, but less endearing.  A waste of time.  Now I think Cars was robbed even more at the Oscars.
0307346609|5.0|If, like me, you had spent your life thinking that zombies and great fiction were an odd combination at best and mutually exclusive at worst, Max Brooks's World War Z should be about as big a wake-up call as a bite on the arm from an undead killing machine itself.  All the rave reviews this book has generated are more than legit--it's as instant a classic as, dare I say, Night of the Living Dead must have been back in 1968.  Writing with incredible flair and a touch of dark humor, Brooks takes a seemingly silly and unoriginal premise--an assault on humanity by an incalculable number of reanimated corpses--and puts a new spin on it, in the process creating a narrative so absorbing that my first act upon finishing this book was to go back to the beginning and start reading it again.  An obvious comparison is to George A. Romero's legendary living dead films, and indeed Brooks does seem to take his \\"rules\\" for zombie behavior and physiology from Romero, but Brooks turns out to have a gripping style and knack for language all his own.  Brooks follows the world's war against the undead from the first outbreaks in China, to the Great Panic that saw the breakdown of the entire established order that the world took for granted, to the eventual and incredibly costly turning of the tide as mankind regrouped and went on the offensive.  Brooks actually manages to create a zombie-plagued world that seems frighteningly real, with no aspect of the war against the undead (aka \\"Zack\\") ignored, be it epidemiological, physchological, strategic, or technological.  With pinpoint accuracy and insight, Brooks captures how the very humanity of the living became their greatest liability, as people's rashness and panic in the face of an intractable, fearless enemy causes as much death and destruction as the walking dead themselves.  This being a book about a worldwide zombie holocaust, there are af course some descriptions of open warfare and the occasional bit of gore (can't deny the zombie enthusiasts *everything*), but at its heart World War Z is a classic piece of apocalyptic writing, and an astonishingly detailed and comprehensive one at that.  Brooks has clearly done his homework here, placing the zombie outbreak squarely in the context of the real world circa 2007, with the U.S. just coming out of a damaging and unpopular war, China taking steps toward becoming a superpower while still hampered by a blatantly repressive government, and Russia as mired in chaos and corruption as ever.  Naturally, the conditions in these countries all color their responses to the outbreak, which helps give the book much of its surprisingly realistic feel.  The oral history format was a stroke of genius, allowing Brooks to address the subject with the sort of breadth and worldwide perspective that no movie could provide while giving even the seemingly driest discussions of logistics or geopolitics a personal, experiential feel.  Still, it's when Brooks gets into first-hand accounts from surivors of the Great Panic and its aftermath, those who faced down the enemy personally and lived to tell about it, that World War Z truly emerges as a can't-put-it-down-unless-absolutely-necessary kind of read.  The survivors tell stories of courage, sacrifice, horror and survival that manage to be as affecting as anything you'd read in a similar history of a \\"conventional\\" war--an Indian engineer who recounts a legendary general's heroism at the height of the panic; a U.S. pilot whose narrow escape from a crash in the swamps of Louisiana turns into a harrowing, violent run for her life; and a blinded Hiroshima survivor who rediscovers meaning in his life while fighting off legions of the undead in the mountains of Japan all contribute to Brooks's creation of a dystopian future that still allowed some moments of light to creep in.  The dark side of human nature is, of course, covered as well--cannibalism, profiteering, governmental perfidy, and the bizarre story of \\"Quislings,\\" uninfected humans whose response to the fight-or-die predicament thrust upon them by the outbreak was to simulate the symptoms of infection as best they could, right down to the biting.  Overall, Brooks leaves no base uncovered, making World War Z the perfect experience for those who want a look behind the blood-and-guts focus that so often marks even good zombie movies.  Definitely worth a read, and probably a re-read as well.infected humans whose response to the fight-or-die predicament thrust upon them by the outbreak was to simulate the symptoms of infection as best they could, right down to the biting.

B000006TSC|3.0|I have to confess that this 1978 album is not nearly as bad as people have made it out to be - (the reviews of the album on ProgArchives are particularly merciless and vicious).  In fact, while Breathless may not necessarily present the band at their finest hour (especially in contrast with albums like The Snow Goose (1975) and Moonmadness (1976)), there is some good material to be found.  Then again, Camel was no different from the other English prog bands active at the time and suffered from the same confusion with respect to what musical direction they were supposed to head in.  Furthermore,(without naming names) Breathless is certainly no worse than other albums floating around in 1978.<br /><br />The lineup at this point included Andrew Latimer (acoustic and electric guitars, Yamaha CS80/50, Vocals); Peter Bardens (electric piano, acoustic piano, synthesizers, Hammond organ, Vocals); Mel Collins (Flute, Saxophones); Richard Sinclair (Bass guitar, Vocals); Andy Ward (Drums, Percussion); and Dave Sinclair (Keyboards (uncredited)).  In general the playing by all members is very good, with Andy Latimer contributing some fine playing.  I have always been a fan of Richard Sinclair's vocals and bass playing, so his presence on the album works for me.  Following this album, Peter and Richard left the band.  Apparently Peter and Andy Latimer were having problems (creative differences), which precipitated his leaving the band, and he was replaced by two keyboardists for the Breathless tour including Dave Sinclair and Jan Schelhaas.  For the I Can See Your House from Here album (1979), the two keyboardist approach was maintained, yet with Jan and ex-Happy the Man player Kit Watkins.<br /><br />The tracks on the album range in length from 2'59\\" to 7'17\\".  In general the music on Breathless is considerably different from previous albums and includes a greater percentage of mainstream styles, including a sizeable chunk of disco (Summer Lightning, You Make me Smile).  The inclusion of Richard's whimsical Canterbury track `Down on the Farm\\", while entirely appropriate for a Caravan album, seems a bit out of place on a Camel album - although his vocal part is very interesting.  Wing and a Prayer is not completely awful, and is actually just a very nice and well-written pop song, with great woodwind parts.<br /><br />Although this may all sound very unappealing, there are however some nice \\"Camel-ish\\" pieces on the album that are actually very good including the highly melodic title track, the vigorous progger Echoes, the delicate Starlight Ride, another atmospheric/proggy track The Sleeper, and the synthesizer heavy and gloomy closing track Rainbow's End.  I am of the opinion that the album is worth picking up just for those five tracks alone, albeit at a \\"used copy\\" price.<br /><br />Well there you have it.  While Breathless may not represent Camel at their finest hour, there is still some good material here.  For those of you that are new to the band, start out with any of these albums: Camel (1973); Mirage (1974); The Snow Goose (1975); Moonmadness (1976); and Rain Dances (1977).

B000002MM8|3.0|After an absence of three years which saw the release of a best of collection, Dead Can Dance achieved their commercial and U.S. breakthrough as well as yet another stylistic shift with this, their sixth studio album. Unlike previous albums which featured backing musicians, this one saw the DCD duo of Brendan Perry and Lisa Gerrard handling all the instruments and vocals themselves in their new private studio. While this mostly works, occasionally the synthesizers sound a bit thin and one wishes they had employed musicians playing actual instruments for certain passages.     Stylistically, DCD moved on from the medieval arrangements of their previous album, Aion, towards more middle eastern influences alternating with dreamy pop sounds. This album also marks an increasing estrangement of the duo's individual musical styles. Lisa's dramatic opener, Yulunga, sets the tone with her chilling multi-octave wordless singing over building percussion, followed by what was to become one of the unlikelier alternative radio hits, Brendan's The Ubiquitous Mr. Lovegrove, a bitter rebuke to an unfaithful lover delivered over a crisp background of tablas and period bagpipes. Lisa then startles longtime fans by delivering the next track, the Wind That Shakes the Barley, an actual traditional song with lyrics (as opposed to her usual wordless glossolalia).  Brendan's song of dreamy nostalgia, The Carnival Is Over, was another minor hit thanks to its being featured as the theme of MTV's Real World, and is as close as the group had come so far to mainstream pop. Less successful is his third original song on the album, Tell Me About The Forest, which lyrically strays into preachiness and musically provides little interest. His closing piece on the album is an arrangement of Berthold Brecht's How Fortunate The Man Who Has None, which achieves a kind of gloomy dignity musically but strains to sustain interest throughout its full nine minute length.    The rest of the album is heavier on middle eastern and eastern European influences. Lisa's Ariadne is a brief but lovely piece featuring multitracked vocals over organ, while her even briefer Saldek sounds like it came straight from a National Geographic special on traditional Bulgarian music. The title track is a meandering and ultimately not very interesting set of passages of middle eastern styled singing and drumming with synthesizer; the similar Spider's Strategem features the same musical elements but actually comes together as a more interesting and compelling whole. The medieval a capella choral piece Emmeleia sounds like an outtake from Aion.    This album marked a watershed in several ways for the group, and for many fans was their initial introduction to DCD and hence defined their sense of the duo's musical identity, but I can't give it more than three stars. Though it features some terrific songs, much of it sounds like filler, and the stripped production pales in comparison to their best earlier work. To get a sense of what this duo is really capable of, find a copy of Within the Realm of a Dying Sun, Spleen and Ideal, The Serpent's Egg, or Aion.

B00005JNS0|5.0|Before seeing this movie, and after, I am not a NASCAR fan.  But, this movie is done in such a way that those who even hate race car stuff can enjoy.  Like most Pixar flicks, this one has a mix of action/adventure, suspense, drama, comedy and family fun, with some adult innuendo that the kids don't notice.  Looking at how Pixar has evolved over the years, this is by far the best yet.
B000002GB2|4.0|I waited at least (gasp) over 25 years from the time that I had first heard of Styx (maybe 79-80) before I purchased my first Styx album (The Grand Illusion, 1977).  I enjoyed that album so much that I started right at the beginning with the Wooden Nickel albums and worked my way up through Pieces of Eight (1978).  This 1975 release was the band's first major label release following the final Wooden Nickel album Man of Miracles (1974) and shows the band beginning to develop the signature sound that was brought to it's fullest expression on albums like The Grand Illusion and Pieces of Eight.  In general, Equinoxe presents a good example of American hard rock with aspects of English Progressive rock mixed in that makes for a very enjoyable listening experience.<br /><br />The lineup at this point included John Curulewski (electric and acoustic guitars, synthesizers, vocals); Dennis DeYoung (acoustic piano, synthesizers, Hammond organ, vocals); Chuck Panozzo (bass guitar and vocals); John Panozzo (drums, percussion, and vocals); and James Young (electric and acoustic guitars, vocals).  All of the guys are solid players and there is some good ensemble work.  The flourishes on the synthesizers (mini moog I think) are reminiscent of some English progressive rock and add a lot to the overall sound.  All of the vocalists are great and there are some excellent vocal harmonies throughout the entire album.  Equinoxe would be John Curulewski's last album with the band and he was replaced by Tommy Shaw on the follow up Crystal Ball (1976).<br /><br />The eight tracks on the album range in length from 3'19 to the 7'52\\" Prelude 12/Suite Madame Blue suite.  In large part, the music on Equinoxe is fairly sophisticated hard rock with some progressive touches here and there.  All in all, this makes for a pretty good combination in my book.  There are nice dynamic contrasts between the spacier sections dominated by acoustic guitars/synthesizers and the harder rocking tunes dominated by heavily distorted guitars, a \\"heavy metal\\" vocal style, and a thunderous rhythm section, e.g. Midnight Ride, Born for Adventure.  Melodies are also used a lot on Equinoxe and leaven the heavier aspects of the music nicely.  I have to say that as a hard core prog fan, my favorite moments on the album include the rich sounding 12 string acoustic guitars on Prelude 12; the spacey synthesizers on Suite Madame Blue, and the tracks Light Up and Lorelei, although all of the tracks are pretty enjoyable.<br /><br />This album is recommended to those folks that like well arranged and well played hard rock, with touches of prog here and there along with The Grand Illusion and Pieces of Eight.  Other stylistically similar albums that might be enjoyable include two by Kansas (Song for America, 1975; Leftoverture, 1976) and two by Rush (Farewell to Kings, 1977; and Hemispheres, 1978).rted guitars, a \\"heavy metal\\" vocal style, and a thunderous rhythm section, e.g. Midnight Ride, Born for Adventure.

0743496728|3.0|The first problem I had with 19 MINUTES was the rampant author intrusion. For the uninitiated, author intrusion is when the author employs plot threads or has a character do things that would never happen in real life. For instance, on his first day of kindergarten, some fifth graders throw Peter Houghton's lunchbox off the bus. If through some miracle, this would happen, somebody would tell, or one of the many mother hens that accompany them would pounce on the offenders like Hulk Hogan on Kenny Jay. Picoult lets it happen at least three more times that year. The second example was Judge Cormier's unwillingness to recuse herself from the Houghton case. Even if the defense attorney had not called her daughter as a witness, Judge Cormier would've had more sense than that. Finally, there's the ending. Picoult must have been sick to death of the book is all I can say. The ending was totally unrealistic.<br /><br /> Then there are the cliches: Most jocks are bullies; even smart girls would do anything to be popular; computer fanatics are geeks. From my experience, athletes are too fixated on their sport to care about harassing some puny freshman. Besides, bullies generally are looking for validation, and athletes get plenty of that. Smart girls are more concerned with ACT scores and getting into the right college. Finally, just about every kid who goes to school these days knows computer programming.<br /><br /> Picoult also has the irritating habit of starting her book with seven or eight different viewpoint characters. I found myself paging back and forth trying to figure out who I was reading about. She also fools around with time. Throughout the novel, she moves from the school shooting to before the school shooting to after the school shooting. There were times when I didn't know where I was in this time sequence.<br /><br /> The above may sound like I didn't enjoy the book. I did, right up until the forced ending. Picoult kept me turning pages, and that's the test of any novel. I also liked the characters. Picoult visited many of the schools that have been traumatized by school shootings, one of them being Cold Spring, Minnesota, which is only thirty-five miles from where I live.

0880793589|5.0|From the book: Human beings occupy a special niche in the order of things. Because we have the ability to symbolize our experience, our thinking is not limited to the real or the present. This capability empowers our thinking in two major ways. First, it enables us to anticipate the future. We are able to ask ourselves: \\"Suppose it rains tomorrow. What would happen to our picnic? What alternative arrangements should be made?\\" By simulating such possibilities we can plan the future. Second, since our thinking is not bound by real world contraints, we can generate ideas that have no correlate in the world of experience.    This deck and the accompanying book were created by Roger von Oech. It calls itself a \\"creative thinking workshop in a box.\\" and I have to agree. Consisting of 64 cards, each card represents a way of thinking outside the box, and gives you a new angle to take on a difficult problem in your life.          More from the book: The practice of looking for the one right answer can have serious consequences in the way we think about and deal with problems. Most people don't like problems, and when they encounter them, they usually react by taking the first way out they can find, even if they solve the wrong problem. I can't overstate the danger in this. If you have only one idea, you have only one course of action open to you, and this is quite risky in a world where flexibility is a requirement for survival.    The cards are broken into 4 suits: The Explorer, The Artist, The Judge, and the Warrior, and each represent the 4 types of thinking in the creative process. The accompanying insert in the deck also gives an example reading using a 5 card layout. I was also fortunate enough to pick up the book entitled \\"A Whack on the Head\\" which made using the deck even more enlightening.    More from the book: There are places where errors are inappropriate, but the imaginative phase of the creative process isn't one of them. Errors or signs that you are diverging from the well-traveled path. A large part of creative thinking is not being afraid to fail. Remember these two benefits of failure. First, if you do fail, you learn what doesn't work. Second, the failure gives you an opportunity to try a new approach.    Lots of fun, and very insightful, this deck is a great tool for tapping into the creativity you're keeping locked away. My favorite technique with this deck is to draw one card each morning along with my daily reading, and try to incorporate its concept throughout the day. I have truly been amazed at some of the results!
B000062X90|4.0|Interestingly enough, my first exposure to this great album was through the Supernatural Fairytales progressive rock box set put out by Rhino.  The track presented on the box set was Warrior, an imaginative bit of hard rock that sounded \\"proggy enough\\" that my curiosity was piqued and I picked this album up.  All in all, Argus (1972) is an excellent concept album of hard rock that features some great playing and features creative arrangements.<br /><br />The lineup on the album included Steve Upton (drums and percussion); Martin Turner (Gibson Thunderbird bass guitar); Andy Powell (electric and acoustic guitars); and Ted Turner (electric and acoustic guitars).  Much to my surprise (and delight) John Tout of English progressive rock group Renaissance played a very \\"churchy\\" sounding Hammond organ on Throw down the Sword (although I swear that I heard a tiny bit of mellotron buried in there somewhere as well).  The guys are all great musicians and are capable of jamming pretty intensely.  I especially like the aggressive and trebly sound that Martin gets out of his Gibson - in fact it reminds me a great deal of the sound John Entwistle would get.  As a side note, Wishbone Ash had supported The Who on a few occasions, and their influence is felt on a few tracks (particularly Time Was, which would not have been out of place on Who's Next (1971)).  The twin lead guitar work is also great and a pleasant change of pace for me - as a progger I am used to hearing leads played on synthesizers or just a single lead guitar (two guitarists were highly unusual for most prog bands).<br /><br />The music on Argus is a great blend of hard rock jamming, nice acoustic passages, and thoughtful arrangements.  Dynamics are used pretty effectively and the quieter pieces balance the heavier tracks nicely.  The vocal melodies are also excellent and really contribute a great deal to the album, which seems to be arranged in a song-cycle suite of sorts.<br /><br />This remastered album features great sound quality and loads of liner notes.  The bonus tracks are all excellent although my favorite is 10'10\\" proggy workout entitled The Pilgrim - this is a fantastic track that features some intricate ensemble work and great playing by the entire band.  Another fun track is the high energy jam on the 17'05\\" Phoenix.  Apparently, the three bonus tracks were taken from an August 21, 1972 concert in Memphis, Tennessee, USA and were released as a limited edition promotional album.<br /><br />All in all, a great album of hard rock by this English band that is creative enough that it makes for a very enjoyable listening experience.d loads of liner notes.

B000J2FD7O|5.0|The acting was superb, the story was awesome and engaging, I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen the entire time, and it is filmed and directed with care, which is rare in films these days.  So what if the world was mostly inhabitated by teens in this film?  It did not flaw my enjoyment of this film.  While the film was obviously influenced by class Film Noir genre movies, Cache, Veronica Mars, and, yes, many mafia films, Brick is clearly an original piece, which is a great change from all of these \\"Bread and Circus\\" films that are plaguing mainstream cinemas as we speak.  What more can be said other than sit back, pop this dvd in, grab some snacks and enjoy.
B0001WTWCO|5.0|I cannot recommend this movie more than this.  It is, from my opinion, epic.
B00005JPOE|5.0|This film is focused on the little known, at least in America, but historically important William Wilberforce (Ioan Gruffudd) who played a vital role in putting an end to the African slave trade in Great Britain. The slave trade was abolished there in 1807, over 50 years before it was ended in the United States. This was especially significant because it was, to the best of my knowledge, the first time a political movement had succeeded in stopping the slave trade throughout an entire nation. It also went on to serve as an impetus and inspiration for the abolition of slavery throughout much of the world. Slavery, of course, being an oppressive practice that dates back to the earliest days of humananity and that has existed throughout world history, including today in parts of Africa, such as the Sudan. <br /> <br />Director Michael Apted does a beautiful job of accurately portraying this important era in British history, with a fascinating set of characters that include Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger (Benedict Cumberhatch), Wilberforce's wife Barbara Spooner (Romola Garai) and former slave and abolitionist writer Olaudah Equiano (Youssou N'Dour). I especially enjoyed the character of John Newton (Albert Finney), the ex-slave trader turned abolitionist preacher who wrote \\"Amazing Grace\\". <br /> <br />The movie is passionate without being self-righteous. It also manages to add some depth and nuance to it's characters, especially Wilberforce himself. He is depicted, later in life, as being disillusioned with politics and addicted to the opiate laudanum before his relationship with the young, idealistic Barbara manages to revive his hope and give him the energy to return to Parliament and eventually help pass the legislation that outlawed the British slave trade. An additional nice touch is that it shows how Christian evangelicalism has not always dominated by right wing Republicans. But instead were once leaders in the movement for progressive social change.<br /> <br />This is a very fine film worthy of a large audience. I hope especially that young people and African-Americans turn out to see this movie because, as Bob Marley once sang, \\"If you don't know your history, then you don't know where you're coming from\\". Go see it!
B000001ESJ|5.0|I really enjoyed this 1977 album (way back when) and along with the excellent Hemispheres (1978), Farewell to Kings finds the band at a proggy peak.  The overall sound of Farewell to Kings borrows heavily from English progressive rock, yet with a healthy dose of hard rock and heavy metal styles.  Overall, I find the combination pretty exciting and the album makes for a great listen.<br /><br />The lineup on Farewell to Kings includes Geddy Lee (lead vocals, Rickenbacker 4001 bass, Taurus bass pedals, mini-moog synthesizer, and 12-string acoustic guitar); Neil Peart (drums and percussion); and Alex Lifeson (6 and 12 string electric and acoustic guitars, classical nylon guitar, and Taurus bass pedals).  I think that of all the bands in the progressive hard rock/heavy metal genre (e.g. Kansas, Styx), Rush had the finest musicians.  Geddy Lee is a superb bassist and along with incredible drummer Neil Peart made up one of the finest rhythm sections around.  I recall listening to Neal's drumming in particular and loving the thunderous fills on his roto toms and the excellent double bass drum attacks here and there.  Neal also happened to be a superb lyricist and his lyrics on Farewell to Kings are exceptional.<br /><br />The six tracks on the album range in length from 2'33\\" to the lengthy 11'05\\" Xanadu suite.  Musically, this album borrows heavily from English progressive rock and the epic length pieces, odd time signatures, dense ensemble work, virtuoso performances, vaguely experimental sections, and sharp acoustic/electric contrasts are plastered all over the album.  Synthesizers are used a lot too, which makes the comparison with the English prog bands unavoidable.  There is also a prominent hard rock/heavy metal element present too - Geddy's vocal style really makes this come across, but the heavily distorted electric guitar also contributes.  Although I really enjoy all of the tracks, my favorites include Xanadu and the lengthy 10'21\\" Cygnus X-1 suite (which was continued on Hemispheres).  This track, along with Xanadu features some nice spacey, acoustic passages and the muscular riffs that featured prominently in a lot of their compositions.  Cygnus X-1 also has it's crazy moments too, particularly on the frenzied closing passage whereby \\"sound and fury drowns my heart, every nerve is torn apart...\\"  Of course, although I have been obsessing over the prog component of the album, there are some nice \\"songs\\" on the album too including Closer to the Heart and the delicate track Madrigal.  The title track and Cinderella Man are concise, yet complex prog statements.<br /><br />This remastered album features great sound quality and restored cover art.<br /><br />All in all, this album is highly recommended along with the excellent Hemispheres.

B0000029DD|5.0|Grace, as the first (and only) fully completed record by jeff buckley, is, as a whole, the most beautiful musical endevour i have ever run across. it's dense and addictive and haunting. his melodic sense is completely his own. the origional songs on grace are beautiful but not yet altogether defined, or at least that's how i interpret it now, having listened to the album hundreds of times. but that density and still forming quality is increadibly appealing to my youth. his words resonate.  <br />the album sticks together as a whole. his voice is beautiful, peircing, his range awe-inspiring. the bare simplicity of Haleluja is so beautiful as to be physically painful. Dream Brother is completely haunting and leaves me grasping at shadows. Last Goodbye has a totally bizzare melodic structure. Lover, You Should Have Come Over is increadibly true to youth. Eternal Life is loud and angry. Corpus Christi is sort of jaw dropping just because it's hard to believe he had the range to sing it. musically grace is, quite simply, brilliant.  <br />but what sets jeff buckley, and specifically Grace, appart, is something  beyond musical ability. he brought music his whole being it seems.  he didnt hold any emotion back. he sang becuase he truly loved to. and he could bring people emotion through his voice. anger, desire, sorrow, pain, love, joy, euphoria. listening to jeff buckley is like reading Cormac McCarthy. it brings one such a clear picture, or feeling, of raw humanity. it hurts but it's true to existance.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|To those of you who truly appreciated Connery and Lazenby, Daniel Craig has successfully filled in the shoes of James Bond.  No puffy, frilly effects with this, the first of the Bond series.   <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
B000001GS4|5.0|If my house were burning down, this is something I would try to save from the flames.  Not because it is the greatest piece of music ever performed - I have better CDs, lots of them, alone from Martha - but simply because the performance of the Nutcracker delivers more unadulterated pleasure than almost anything else I own (can't speak for the concerto - i listened to it once, and haven't done so again since).

031236198X|3.0|My favorite part of John Kotter's classic, Leading Change, is the cover image of a penguin leaping across a space between two blocks of ice while 10 other penguins look on from the side the penguin leaped from.  Here is one case where you can tell the book by its cover.<br /><br />Obviously, that wonderful image penetrated deeply into the consciousness of Holger Rathgeber in designing this penguin-based version of how a leader might deal with the problem in Who Moved My Cheese? (changing conditions affect survival)?  If you miss that connection to Who Moved My Cheese? there's a foreword by Spencer Johnson to make it clearer.<br /><br />The Emperor Penguins have lived on an iceberg in Antarctica for many years.  They planned to always live there.  But Fred had a different idea:  The iceberg was melting in a way that meant the possibility of a catastrophic collapse in mid-Winter.  The rest of the book explores how Fred's knowledge is translated into useful action for the 268 penguins that lived in the colony.<br /><br />The fable naturally draws on John Kotter's famous eight steps for leading change which I have paraphrased below into seven to make them easier to understand:<br /><br />1.  Get peoples' attention.<br /><br />2.  Establish a change-leading team.<br /><br />3.  Agree on the results you want.<br /><br />4.  Allow needed changes.<br /><br />5.  Show regular progress.<br /><br />6.  Stay focused.<br /><br />7.  Build new habits that will serve you well after the change is done.<br /><br />Fables are difficult to write.  I admire John Kotter and Holger Rathgeber for taking a crack at it.<br /><br />But if you pay attention to the facts, you'll find that their story doesn't quite make sense.  Emperor Penguins live on the pack ice that forms seasonally.  As the pack ice retreats, they simply move to the edge.  Seldom would they stay on an iceberg.  Why?  Because the ice breaks up when the youngsters are old enough to swim to the main ice pack.  If you read science articles, you'll also learn that what is more likely to threaten a penguin community is that their iceberg drifts into an area where the winter freeze isolates the colony too far from the open sea.  The penguins have to walk to the sea rather than dive in to get food.<br /><br />Also, most icebergs are going to eventually release into warmer seas and melt that way rather than be split by freezing water as described in this book.<br /><br />If you look at the leadership, it's also very male dominated.  The story would be more realistic if it included more male-female interaction.<br /><br />The problem of survival in the face of the environment seems more akin to what a town council might face in deciding to relocate away from a leaking dam that what a business organization might face.<br /><br />I could go on, but I'm sure you see the point:  A better fable could have been written (even if it had to involve penguins).<br /><br />I also compared the book to Leading Change and The Heart of Change.  Unless you are only able to learn by reading fables, both of those books are much better on this subject.<br /><br />My suggestion is that you let the iceberg melt and read about how people lead instead in Dr. Kotter's other excellent books.s, you'll also learn that what is more likely to threaten a penguin community is that their iceberg drifts into an area where the winter freeze isolates the colony too far from the open sea.

0143038419|1.0|I've read several of the reviews posted here and though I couldn't finish this book, it seems to me that what's wrong with it is not so much the author's hollow-souled narcissism but her lack of intellectual seriousness. Someone gave me this book as a birthday present. That it has received a lot of attention is no surprise.  Look at the drivel America reads.  Light, shallow laughs, sex, food, not much real thought.  That's the sum of this book.  Feel-good rubbish that inspires not one iota of serious thought.  Gilbert's slapphappy universe is one in which everything can be solved with pizza and fresh mozarella.  Every paragraph contains at least one stock one-liner.  This isn't literature.  It's stand-up comedy of the worst kind.  We've read it all before.  She claims she can make friends with anyone.  It's precisely that lack of discernment and depth that makes this story forgettable.  The prose is laced with one cliche, one trite and cutesy obvservation after another.   Some reviewer here said this book is not a book but a magazine article.  Exactly right. I finally closed the book when I read that while in India she wanted to \\"valet park\\" a destitue family into a new life.  It isn't just that the phrase is a silly toss-off modernism but that  there's no true emotion in it.  You'll never know how this woman really feels.  Don't waste your money on it.
B000NDI3SK|5.0|Of the three major British TV series in the past that took a 'big vision' of the development of civilisation in technical and/or intellectual senses: Clarke's 'Civilisation', Bronowski's 'Ascent', and Burke's 'Connections' by far the most conceptually penetrating and diverse was Bronowski's. <br /> <br />I would characterise it like this, with Clarke we get the Aristocrat/Scholar, superb and singular in his erudition and exemplary sensibility, with Burke we get the hip materialist university prof who with wit draws together individuals and science in easy-to-understand argument/narratives that make him look clever. With Bronowski we get depth and intellectual risk taking. I think this has to do with how Bronowski chooses to articulate a sense of oblique contemplation about the events he describes as he explains things - that is for him communicating his points is always tied into synthesising a symbolic language of attributes about humanity's progress with scientific or empirical facts. This comes from a variety of things, Bronowski's early interest in literature (particularly William Blake), his heritage as an eastern European Jew, and his experiences as an assessor of the effects of war both as a scientist and as a Jew. <br />His book on Blake, although at times meandering and searching, is the most original attempt at contextualising the poet I've ever read - in a way its a critical assessment of Blake and the associative implications of his writing that models Blakean thought to 20thc conclusions as if it were Blake himself writing it. <br /> <br />Bronowski just simply has more depth and a much greater originality of thought and ethical outlook than the other two. He's a real thinker rather than simply an academic and this comes out in his agility with shifting arenas of investigation during the programs. <br /> <br />Put your kids in front of this guy - its the sort of mind our education system should be producing. I certainly would not say that he is a bad presenter, he's just one that demands a different kind of attention than the shlock sound-byte cardboard cut-out presenters you get so much on TV today. You actually have to spend time observing him as he imparts ideas - his mannerisms are crucial to his public performance and if you can find a way to dig it its endlessly inspiring.
B000FVBLEI|5.0|Ok, all i can say is i saw these guys live in Houston on the 26th of January and they were absolutely amazing.  This album, along with Trivium's The Crusade is album of the year in my book, destined to be a classic, the riffs are amazing, the vocals are crisp, and the drumming is pure speed, nothing less.  And their new drummer is even better.  :) Every song is beastly, if you don't like this album you don't like good metal!!!!!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I was enchanted by Pride and Prejudice from the first time I saw it. You watch the whole movie enthralled, waiting for the next moment to come and at the end you think back on it and realize nothing much really happened. Just some balls and a lot of conversation and yet you watch it again with enthusiasm many times over. The characters are perfectly cast. Matthew Macfadyen as Mr. Darcy is terribly charismatic and proud and just a little bit sinfully delicious with that deeply resonating voice. Keira Knightly is a delightfuly cheerful and strong-willed Lizzy. Rosamund Pike as Jane Bennet is sweet and ethereally beautiful while Simon Woods as Mr. Bingley is heart warmingly akward and charming. You constantly want to cover your ears as protection from the grating trill of Jena Malone's Lydia Bennet and if Mrs. Bennet played by Brenda Blethyn was your mother you'd want to run and hide though she obviously loves her children which makes up for her overbearing manner in some small way. Mr Bennet (Donald Sutherland) is appropriately preoccupied and Judi Dench is coldly regal as Lady Catherine de Bourg. Each and every cast member was, in my opinion, perfect for the part that they played.

0671027344|4.0|After some school districts in my state (AZ) banned this book, I had to read it. In my experience, whenever anyone says you should not read a book, that's exactly what you should do. <br /> <br />The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a coming of age story, plain and simple. It is filled with drugs, sex, parties, friendship, etc. It is the sort of book a teenager can identify with, I think that's why the school boards are so scared of it. <br /> <br />The plot is not entirely original, but the book is interesting. It is a brief read, but a good one. Anyone feeling out of touch with the lives of teenagers in our society should read this book. The characters are well developed and easy to identify with. Good book.
0385333846|4.0|When writing about an enterprise as destructive and foolish as war, an author with a clear agenda must take an absurd approach to the subject in order to address just how ridiculous the entire enterprise is. Like Mr. Vonnegut, I also believe the beings from afar are looking at our silly little circus and asking themselves, \\"Why?\\" The book itself gets 4 stars. The man himself gets more stars then there are available to give.<br /><br />\\"Slaughterhouse Five\\", while not my favorite Vonnegut novel was the first I ever read back in HS. Unlike most other authors I encountered in those painfully formative years, he was saying something I felt I needed to hear.<br /><br />Now as a teacher myself, Vonnegut is the author I most recommend to my students who come to me looking for something different, something that will speak to them. I can't tell you how many times I've lent out \\"Cat's Cradle\\". I can't tell you how many sad teens I saw on Thursday as they all came to me to talk about the death of an author. None of them had ever mourned for a writer before. Many of them may never mourn an author again.
0451191153|5.0|I read this in 2 days and could not set it down. A summary of what the book meant to me: <br /> <br />All of us have something unique to contribute to life, to humanity. We have to dare to venture off the marked road and blaze a bold new path to present a new opportunity, a gift, to our fellowman. Examine yourself deep down to understand your gift, to know what you are meant to contribute in life, then live that purpose unwaveringly and let the naysayers be damned! <br /> <br />It's how I live my life and it's amazing how the Universe throws doors open to you if you just dare to live your life to it's true full potential. <br />
B000K7VHQE|5.0|The is one of the best movies I have seen in years.  It has been described as a movie about a dysfunctional family, but I disagree.  On an important level, these people are us.  Do all of us win all the time?<br /><br />True, in a sense, everyone in the family is a \\"loser.\\"  They do not succeed in that quintessential  \\"American\\" way.  The father isn't great at his job, the mother complains because there isn't enough money, the son is colorblind, Olive isn't \\"pretty\\" in that beauty contest kind of way, the Uncle is gay, has lost a prestigious job, and is unhappy in love, and Grandpa snorts cocaine to numb his pain.  These do not sound like unusual problems to me, but together, they do make for a lot of really funny and poignant moments.<br /><br />FYI:  This is not a Hollywood Myth about the underdog winning the day.  I say \\"Yay!\\"  Aren't you tired of those?<br /><br />I think the movie wants us to ask ourselves what the word \\"loser\\" means.  Each person in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE has failed in some important dream, but are we so enraptured with the American Myth of \\"success\\" that we would truly call this family dysfunctional?  The Myth tells us that \\"anybody\\" can do \\"anything\\" as long as he or she believes hard enough.  I think the movie is saying that the Myth is a dysfunctional myth. The problem with these characters in the beginning is not that they have dreams, but that they are afraid to fail.  Failure in America is a dirty word:  if you can't succeed in America, then where?<br /><br />At the end of the movie, although each character has failed in a significant way, each is a winner in a deeper sense.  And they certainly do not come across to me as \\"losers\\" or as a dysfunctional family.  I think they finally are seeing some things clearly for the first time.  This is a movie filled with humor and humanity.  It is a wonderful antidote to a myth that would make us all feel like \\"losers\\" when things don't go our way.  I wish there were more movies like this.<br /><br />And by the way, I don't laugh easily at movies.  But I laughed so hard at the end of this movie that my glasses steamed up.<br /> <br />And by the way, I don't laugh easily at movies.

0743455967|4.0|I'd like to preface this by saying that I have never been a big fan of Stephen King. I have never liked his style or his subject matter.  <br /> <br />This book, on the other hand, was a whole new monster.  <br /> <br />In this memoir of his craft, Stephen King guides the reader through the writing/publishing process, spicing the whole thing up with clever anecdotes from his life. This book was genuinely interesting. So interesting, in fact, that I read it in one sitting.  <br /> <br />The advice he offers is sound. Who better to tell the general public about the craft of writing than a bestselling author of all time? Even better than the advice is the readability. I challenge anyone to find an instructional book as easy to read as this. <br /> <br />For fans of Stephen King, there is plenty of information about the horror master. It's not all boring information about how to write a book. <br /> <br />A good read and a good reference.
0201721481|5.0|I had been programming in C for a long time already when I read this book. I had mucked around with C++ - reading other peoples' code - before reading it. So, I was not completely clueless, but clueless enough. I knew little about OOP, and had never seen templates before.<br /><br />This book does an excellent job of teaching C++. The book is organized beautifully. The first part gets you going with the basic sytax, but at the same time introduces some library containers almost right at the start. This makes it easy to play with non-trivial code even as you are just starting. The next part is an excellent coverage of containers and algorithms. Then comes a detailed discussion on OOP, which is well worth the price of the book itself. Finally, there is a section on advanced topics.<br /><br />The book is well written, and despite being discouragingly huge, is a breeze to read. Further, the organization above helps in quickly getting familiar with the key ideas of C++ and then zooming in.<br /><br />I have been told by C++ gurus that there are certain flaws in the book, and that at one or two points it may be misleading. I am no C++ guru, and I did not find anything amiss with the book. C++ is not an easy language to learn, but it is not as hard as it is made out to be either. It helps to have an approach to teachin the language that does not start with C, does not build on C, but starts fresh from scratch. This book does that.  For me, this book is sufficient as the only C++ book I need to have on my shelf.
B00005JPAO|5.0|It's hard to imagine a better drama. Although one of my fellow reviewers decided to spend the time sharing with us what asinine things he thought of while watching the film, I will simply say that this crew has brought us a wonderful, well-acted performance of a witty script. Watch this and just savor the chemistry between the queen and prime minister and it's so interesting being an American and watching how the monarchy functions.
B000001DV2|5.0|To me, Def Leppard's ADRENALIZE is so underated and every song on the album is a hit. I think more people would like the album if it came out a lot earlier than what it did back in the spring of 1992.  I have been listening to this album recently and it just gets better, and once again when it comes to Def Leppard every song is a hit from the beginning of the album to the end of the album.
B000MXPE7O|5.0|This film will disappoint anyone looking for a history of the OSS or CIA.<br /><br />However, as a study of character development in the 1930s Isolationist Period, and with a young man choosing an intelligence and counterintelligence career, it hits the mark well.  This is possibly Damon's best so far, as the young idealistid Edward who attends Yale (where, by the way a Gilbert and Sullivan Light Opera with a man in a woman's role is not a \\"homosexual\\" overtone, as this was a conventional way of doing Gilbert and Sullivan....).  He joins the Army and fledgling OSS, making a 6 year exit from his husband-seeking Bones brother's sister who gets pregnant before he knows what is really happening, meeting his son for the first time in 1946.  By this time, he is well indoctrinated and comfortable with the Black Arts.<br /><br />The film starts and ends with the Bay of Pigs debacle, by which time he has learned to trust no one and has no real friends.  By 1961, he is humorless and quite comfortable with this role.  What he and his Brothers have, you see, at the end of the day, is The United States of America, and all others a merely \\"visitors\\".<br /><br />A remarkable study, fictive though horrifying at times, and somewhat complex, as any operative likes life...

0525476881|5.0|The moment I finished, I wanted to rush out and give this novel to all my reader friends. Unfortunately, it is just too good to do that with - John Green deserves every one of those friends to buy it for themselves. <br /> <br />Green, the Printz Award-Winning author of Looking For Alaska, has definitely succeeded in his sophomore effort - Katherines is a charming mix of interesting characters, thought-provoking prose, and laugh-out-loud moments. Such a combination reads like a brilliant hybrid of J.D. Salinger-esque emotion with all the sideways humor of a Christopher Moore novel. <br /> <br />The major success of the book is neither its emotional arc nor its spot-on humor, but the characters themselves. Every single secondary character, no matter how minor, is drawn perfectly - there isn't a cookie-cutter in the bunch. Colin Singleton, the protagonist, is even better: an endearing mix of tremendous brain power, introspection, and a healthy dose of social awkwardness, makes him completely sympathetic to the audience. <br /> <br />As an avid reader of all genres and a YA writer, it is rare that I come across a book that truly wows me anymore, but An Abundance of Katherines succeeded. The 2007 Printz Honor this book just received is well earned, you won't regret this read!
B000LC55F2|5.0|Last year gave us two films about 19th century magicians.  Both were good films but quite different.  Where \\"The Illusionist\\" is, at its core, a love story, \\"The Prestige\\" is about obsession and the lengths a person will go to in order to overcome a rival.<br /><br />The story starts with Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rufus Angiers (Hugh Jackman) as friends working onstage for another magician.  After an tragedy onstage, the two men go their separate ways and become magicians in their own right.  Alfred is the best magician of the two but it is Angiers who is the best entertainer.  After Alfred comes up with a new trick called The Transporter Man, Angiers' jealousy kicks in and this sets the plot in motion.  Both men are determined to best the other's act, using sabatoge and deception if necessary.  The story takes several twists and turns, making the viewer question each man's goodness.  In the end, we are shown the true darkness of one man, who will do, at all cost, whatever it takes to be the best of the best.  In the end, we find out the prestige (or final act) of both men, which I think is quite satisfying.<br /><br />Bale and Jackman are terrific as the battling magicians.  Michael Caine also does well as a prop inventor who assists Angiers with his onstage act.  Scarlett Johanson plays a magician's assistant and also a femme fatale of sorts, becoming intertwined in the lives of both men.  And Christopher Nolan, a talent director, gives the viewers yet an enteraining and well made film.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie and highly recommend it to everyone.  Definitely worth adding to your dvd library.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|I bought this sweeper about a year ago.  At the beginning I was very pleased with it.  I bought it for those quick pick-ups in the bathroom and kitchen, so I wasn't expecting it to work like a big vaccuum cleaner.  Worked great.  After using it maybe 4 or 5 times, I noticed that the battery would not hold a charge for very long.  Now it won't hold a charge at all.  I charged it according to the instructions and never over-charged it.  I wrote the company twice and to date have not received any reply and that has been 2 months ago.
B000AARKOO|4.0|I'm writing this out of frustration. I saw the ending twice on HBO - Free week-end - liked what I saw so decided to order from Amazon. The only problem is that it arrived in a double dvd pkg that I have yet to figure out how to open. There is a red plastic piece on the right side. It can neither be pushed up / down - or flipped open. I tried to force it open prying with a knife - nothing has worked. Those discs are inside for good. I'm going to Best Buy tomorrow to see if their version has this same mysterious red tab. Obviously I'm the only one who has had this issue with getting the case opened. But, as I said before, what I did get to see of the movie, (the last half hour) on hbo . . . I liked. A slice of history that even if the details are made for the movie, was enlightening about the struggles that still continue in that part of the world today.
B000F8O4E0|3.0|Don't get me wrong, this is a great collection of songs! I love them! <br />I owned the vinyl, I bought the Gold cd remaster, too. I think the problem lies with the poorly recorded basic tracks, especially the drums, which are mostly distorted, and lack any dynamic range (cardboard boxes?). Drums, bass, guitars, and synths sound as if they were squeezed onto one track in order to make room for more guitar, synth, voices and string overdubs. I was hoping that Jeff would RESCUE and RESTORE this album, and free up all those elements with a nice stereo mix. Have you heard the restoration on 60's Beatles tracks that make up the remixed/remastered Yellow Submarine? Pet Sounds in Stereo from the original Mono? The awesomely improved sound of Aqualung? Who's Next? My G-G-G-Generation? It HAS been done. The sound is a bit better, but Jeff Lynne, I am disappointed, sir! <br />
B0002EXH4K|5.0|I bought Megadeth's 1992 effort \\"Countdown to Extinction (their 5th album overall) about 5 years back when I was a senior in high school, and this was the first Megadeth album I ever got into, and I suddently became a fan instantly. Then I would go on to buy other Deth classics such as \\"Rust in Peace\\", \\"Peace Sells But Who's Buying\\", \\"Killing is my Business, and Business is Good\\", \\"So Far, So Good, So What\\", and so forth. Sure \\"Countdown to Extinction\\" is not an all out thrash assault like their previous classics, but this album is Megadeth all the way through, and it's one of their best albums of all time as well. Frontman Dave Mustaine (who also has great vocals on here) is no doubt one of heavy metal's greatest and legendary guitarists of all time. Second guitarist Marty Friedman also rules on the guitar as well. You've got tons of great catchy riffs and awesome ripping solos from both Dave and Marty. David Ellefson has great heavy bass lines that will make your walls shake, and there's nice solid drumming courtesy of Nick Menza. The opeining track \\"Skin O'My Teeth\\" is a great addicting opener that starts off with a short but sweet drum solo then some catchy guitar riffs come in to play. The chorus is pretty catchy and the solo by Marty is great. \\"Symphony of Destruction\\" is one of the band's greatest songs ever written, and remains a true classic. Words can't describe how much I love that song. \\"Architecture of Aggression\\" is another classic which starts off with the sounds of war and gunfire, and is soon followed by some chugging riffs and heavy bass. This is a very political song too. Track four and of my all time favorite songs on here \\"Foreclosure of a Dream\\" is a sad and tragic look at the death of the American Dream and it also tells about the rise and fall of politics and economics. It also includes the famous \\"Read My Lips\\" speech from George Bush Sr. \\"Sweating Bullets\\" is another one of my favorites on here which includes a nice steady drum beat, some nice slow catchy riffs, a nice killer solo from Dave, and some pretty entertaining lyrics as well. \\"Pyschotron\\" is another favorite of mine in which I believe includes seven killer solos which were all done by Marty. Track ten \\"Captive Honour\\" lyrically tells about the prison system and the consequences of crime. There's also a mid song skit in where a judge and jury sentences a man to life in prison included as well. Great solos by Dave and Marty BTW. \\"Ashes in Your Mouth\\" is a great album closer with some good tempo changes, great fast riffs, killer solos, and a sick fast drum solo near the end. A great way to end the album. Every song rules, but the ones that I mentioned are my favorites. Please read on for the entire song list and the ratings (please note that the ratings on here apply to the original version of this album that I own)<br /><br />Jeremy's song ratings:<br /><br />1. Skin O'My Teeth - 10/10<br /><br />2. Symphony of Destruction - 10/10<br /><br />3. Architecture of Aggression - 10/10<br /><br />4. Foreclosure of a Dream - 10/10<br /><br />5. Sweating Bullets - 10/10<br /><br />6. This Was My Life - 10/10<br /><br />7. Countdown to Extinction - 10/10<br /><br />8. High Speed Dirt - 10/10<br /><br />9. Psychotron - 10/10<br /><br />10. Captive Honour - 10/10<br /><br />11. Ashes in Your Mouth - 10/10<br /><br />Like I said before \\"Countdown to Extinction\\" may not be an all out speed/thrash fest like \\"Rust in Peace\\" or \\"Peace Sells But Who's Buying\\", but it's still Megadeth all the way, and if you're an open minded metalhead like myself, you'll definately love this album.

B0000YEEGM|5.0|The first thing that pleased me about this purchase was the new cover, synchronously both the same but not the same as the original. Gone was the huge tree-lined drive of the institution from which Charlie was springing his autistic brother, and in its stead appeared a country road underfoot and a beautiful blue sky towering above them, stretching forever and ever. <br />The Internet is overloaded with reviews of the movie Rain Man that have missed the main point of the movie, but the Special Edition of the movie will at the very least have put paid to most of them. Just watch the featurette. It lasts only a few minutes but explains all that had hitherto been missing from those tens of thousands of words. <br />I remember watching the movie on its release and reading in the acknowledgements mention of the role that the autistic society of America played. Yet only concentrating on this and the fact that Hoffman won the Oscar for his role as the autistic Ray (not Cruise who played his brother Charlie) has led many to falsely assume this movie is about Raymond, and thus autism. The producer sets this sidetrack straight in the featurette when he states that the movie is not about Raymond but Charlie, as he is the one who changes. <br />Films communicate their stories through the metaphors they contain. Once you can understand the metaphors, you can understand the movie. By realizing that autism is the vehicle and Charlie's change is the tenor, we can finally get the story's meaning the right way around. <br />To confirm this fact, Tom Cruise comments that Charlie learns to live life again through his brother, Raymond, who is autistic, and that Charlie is an \\"emotional autistic\\". Most films' appeal is a character with strong emotions who changes. Although Charlie changes, Ray is not emotional and does not change. But it was Hoffman who won the Oscar for Best Actor, not Cruise, and he had even suggested that Ray be autistic for the final shooting script. The subject is Charlie's change which we measure by Ray's lack of one. The main metaphor is autism, more than the car or even the journey. Ray's immutability is the yardstick that allows us to savor all the more Charlie's transformation into a feeling human being. <br />The final word from the featurette must go to Hoffman as he made the movie such a major part of himself and vice versa. He spells out his own heart by explaining that, when we meet people whose lives are touched by autism, we can't help but to be affected by them. And we hope that if we could just give them enough love they might somehow be released from their condition. The movie wanted the audience to somehow feel the same way. <br />Charlie has to travel the breadth of America to find out that, though that's impossible, trying to do so can help us heal ourselves. And finally, returning to the box cover, another often missed facet of the movie is also made clear - from the puff of sand when Charlie u-turns at the news of his father's death, through the dead roses, dried up pool, then the rain that weeps into it like tears, the background also transmogrifies as the sky expands in ever deeper shades of blue, love blooming in the gorgeous greening, and the high point, the fountains shooting high into the sky outside the casino hotel after Charlie's new family, Ray and Suzanna are all reunited. <br />
B000MXPE7O|3.0|but several plot twists drop like bombshells in this movie.  Matt Damon's character seems like a closed box.  Felt like I never got to see his true character.  He is so darn reserved and somber -- even when a couple of the surprises hit.  I actually stopped the movie as the character development didn't hold my interest.  Glad I went back because the second half of the movie was worth it!<br /><br />The director took a lot of leeway with the history of the CIA, from what I've read.  It doesn't hurt the movie but historians might complain.<br /><br />Camera work and scenery are great.  The sets were authentic and made me feel like I was looking back in time.  The 1960s buses, taxicabs, clothing -- it added to the movie.  The 1960s era glasses were an especially nice touch.  The makeup used to age Angelina Jolie and Matt Damon was impressive.  They actually appeared to age throughout the movie.<br /><br />Was annoyed by the jumping back and forth in the movie.  Felt there was more than necessary.  First we are in 1961, then 1920s, then 30s, then 60s, then 40s -- the constant changing annoyed me.<br /><br />Still can't believe how stone-faced Matt Damon's character was.  Even when some of the bombshells hit, he kept his cool and didn't show any emotion.  Would hate to play poker against him.
B000MV9026|3.0|For an animated kids film, Happy Feet was unavoidably and overtly sexual--cute penguins sing about \\"making love all night long\\" and wanting each others' bodies for sexual pleasure. There's even moaning and sexual positions suggested.  Way odd (especially for the pre-teens).    The villain, you, is a surprise performer. You are the villain for paying to see penguins in zoos and aquariums. You are the villain for eating fish caught in oceans. You are the villain for producing plastics, sealiners, factories, and cities. So, if you like playing the villain, you will love this shockingly un-happy film. Happy Feet is a sad, depressing film. Your young kids will cry, your teens will be bored, and you'll regret having paid to be lectured to about how evil you are for existing. Save your money and take your pre-teens to Bridge to Terabithia.  On a positive note, Robin Williams is always funny.
B000H30B2C|5.0|I was around when the original King Kong played at the Malco theatre in the 60's. This version of King Kong was wonderful, especially the part where she dances for him, she played the part so well. I never get tired of this movie.
0062502182|4.0|This is a very simple book to read. There are no real complexities to the book.  The characters are one-dimensional and it could easily pass for a younger person's novel.  It is a quick, comfortable read.  It is simple, but don't we \\"adults\\" sometimes want and need that? <br /> <br />I am rating this 4 stars because of the way this book satisfies a need we all have sometimes to read that one type of story which makes us feel as if we could reach some higher destiny whatever it may be.  This book does just that.  You will enjoy the short, little aphorisms and insights (even if they don't seem to be accurate all the time) amidst a story of a journey following one's dream and struggling to achieve it. <br /> <br />In a world in which many lead cubicle, service-centric lives, wouldn't it be nice to escape in a story reminding you life was meant to be more than just \\"settling for anything\\" and destiny could possibly be achieved if only you kept persisting?  This one will.  I loved it for that.  You will too. <br />

B000F8O35U|3.0|The Little Mermaid is the kind of movie that everyone loves, it has wonderful music and usually colorful pictures. Although the music was good, I was in fact disappointed by the picture quality. It says that Disney cleaned up the film in order to make it clearer, but it seemed just way too grainy and foggy at times. I give it only three stars for the sound quality which was great, but lost the other two because of the poor color. Maybe they should have the original and new versions on DVD like in the Lion King, so we can enjoy both the old and the new!!
B00005JPGO|5.0|This is an awesome movie with very strong performances from DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou.  <br />Having lived in West Africa from 1993-1998...this film acuratly portrays the diamond trades and brings home many real situations, dreams and nightmares. <br />The viewer may see this film as a good and intense Drama which serves as a vehichle for DiCaprio and Hounsou...but in fact its a very bright and realistic view of the \\"haves and the have-nots....and the want-to-be's\\"... in Africa.
B000N3SS80|1.0|This woman is brave! Brave for continuing doing something she can't clearly do. SING. In here, she tries to reach the audience she left so far behind, the latin audience. I give her credit for her efforts, or who ever was behind this. If you want to buy a good product from a real singer who has never left his people in the dust, buy Marc Anthony, Jennifer Lopez's 10th husband. He can really SING and has real talent.Jennifer, dear, go home, cook or clean, stay all day looking in the mirror or something.
B00005J6UP|5.0|I never felt this film got the commercial exposure at the box office it should have because so many confused it with 'Ghoulies', which had been released the year before.  No Comparison!!.  I've read some of the other reviews and they're all pretty good, so I'll just add some personal trivia.  The house in the movie is in Astoria, Oregon. Thats the same town where they filmed Kindergarden Cops. Some of the scenes on the beach were near Haystack rock in the Cannon Beach, Oregon neighborhood. When Chunk says he saw the Jeep full of bullet holes and calls it an ORV, that was the slang (off road vehicle) before not so off road products were named SUV's.  Reminiscent of The Little Rascals that Spielberg watched when he was in  school, it's an appealing adventure story, a sort of 'Young, Young, Indiana Jones plot\\". Amazing how Steven Spielberg went from filming a color  silent film of 1965 senior sneak day at Saratoga High School in California to blockbuster mega-mogul film Director, producer et al.  Part of his success was in thinking big.  Although Goonies did not appeal to a broad age group, he didn't cut any corners, spending money on blowing up boats and creating a giant octopus, scenes that hit the cutting room floor.  (but can be viewed on the DVD)  In fact, I think the pirate ship was the largest indoor set ever built>(at that time)  And so Ghoulies faded into history while Goonies speaks to generation after generation, igniting a sense of wonder, speaking to the child in all of us.
B000007MVM|4.0|After leaving (or being dismissed from) Pink Floyd in 1968 due to his LSD use & erratic behaviour, singer/songwriter/guitarist Syd Barrett re-emerged in 1970 with his debut solo album, \\"The Madcap Laughs.\\" The album did not come easy, as Syd never fully recovered from his drug use, and it clearly shows in his ragged performances on \\"Madcap Laughs.\\" Producer Malcolm Jones did what he could with Syd for about half of the album, before handing the production reigns over to Barrett's former Floyd mates Roger Waters & David Gilmour to finish the job. Throughout the album, bum notes are played, beats are missed, and Barrett sings off-key. And on the rocker songs, the session players (from the group The Soft Machine) sound like they are struggling to keep up with Syd, who could hit a rough patch at any moment. For any other artist, this would all be nothing short of disastrous. And YET....in the case of Syd Barrett, any and all mistakes are immediately forgiven. Why? Because Barrett's songs on \\"The Madcap Laughs\\" are all wonderfully written, and although Syd's voice and guitar-playing are obviously not in tip-top condition, you can plainly hear on this album that he's trying. He's really, really *trying* to do his best, and his efforts really do shine through. For every bum note there's a passage that Syd plays beautifully, for every missed beat there are many beats that are hit right on schedule, and for every note that Syd sings off-key, there are many moments where his very distinctive, British voice is magical. And of course, there's Syd's lyrics. You may not know what all of them actually *mean*, really, but to my ears, they're still poetry. The rockers are still powerful (\\"No Good Trying,\\" \\"No Man's Land,\\" the rockabilly fun of \\"Here I Go,\\" and the classic \\"Octopus\\"), and the softer numbers still have great beauty to them (\\"Terrapin,\\" the passionate \\"Dark Globe,\\" the effective \\"Golden Hair\\"---based on a James Joyce poem---and \\"Long Gone\\"). Even the more ragged numbers like \\"Feel\\" and \\"If It's In You,\\" somehow still hang together quite well (amusingly, we even hear some brief banter from Syd in the middle of \\"If It's In You,\\" as his voice goes wildly off the map, he stops playing, prepares for another take, and finally gets through the song). When all is said and done, \\"The Madcap Laughs,\\" warts and all, is an excellent album. It is a flawed masterpiece, and it shows that Syd Barrett, even with his mind irreversibly fractured by this point, was still a genius musician.
B00000IGGA|4.0|The recent fuss over the Chocolate Jesus statue inspired me to pull out this CD, which I bought several years ago after a similarly random inspiration.  At that time it was a senior dancer in my daughter's dance company doing an interpretive dance to a gravelly, bass-voiced rendition of \\"Take It With Me\\".  I'd never heard anyone sing effectively in so low a register, so I asked around about the source and learned about Tom Waits. Until then, I was only aware of Waits as the writer of the song \\"Jersey Girl\\", which I'd heard Bruce Springsteen perform on his first live album.<br /><br />But enough preamble.  In \\"Mule Variations\\" I found an eclectic collection of humorous up-tempo songs (\\"Big in Japan\\", a great cut with clever lyrics from which I took my review title, \\"Eyeball Kid\\" and \\"Filipino Box Spring Hog\\"), ballads similar to \\"Take it With Me\\" (\\"Hold On\\", \\"Picture in a Frame\\", \\"Pony\\"), some low-down blues (\\"Lowside of The Road\\", \\"Cold Water\\", \\"Get Behind the Mule\\" and \\"Black Market Baby\\"), and a couple with a spiritual bent (the aforementioned \\"Chocolate Jesus\\", \\"Georgia Lee\\" (a darker song) and the closer \\"Come On Up to the House.\\")  Waits uses a lot of unconventional accompaniment--\\"What's He Building?\\" is a talking song that appears to be accompanied by power tools.  My favorites besides \\"Japan\\" are the ballads and spirituals, where Waits powerful, albeit raspy bass voice is the main focus, and he often provides his own accompaniment on piano.  I eventually bought Waits \\"Heart Attack and Vine\\", which features his (superior) version of \\"Jersey Girl\\".  Some day I'll add more CD's from this talented, edgy singer-songwriter from below even my bass vocal range.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Having recently seen and enjoyed \\"The Lookout\\", another film which features a character trying to piece together his life after a traumatic head injury leaves him memory-challenged, I was inspired to go back and see its cinematic sire of sorts - the now-classic mindwarp that is Memento.  And though I bought this DVD when it was released and had watched it twice (which is the minimum number of recommended viewings for this film), it's just collected dust for five years and I hadn't returned to it since.<br /><br />Aptly enough, I had forgotten much of it, making much of Memento seem newly fresh yet oddly familiar, much like most of its main character Leonard's daily doings.  Leonard, as we pretty much all know by now, is trying to get revenge for the killing of his wife, which is made somewhat more challenging (to say the least) by the fact that he suffers from extreme short-term memory loss and can't remember any more than ten minutes at a time.  As Leonard himself will tell almost anyone he meets: \\"I can't make new memories - everything fades.\\"<br /><br />All of which would in itself make for an interesting movie.  But what makes this film truly ingenious is the way it is constructed and edited.  You know, one of my dearly-departed favorite author Kurt Vonnegut's Eight Rules for Writing Fiction is: \\"start as close to the end as possible.\\"  Well, Memento takes this rule - written by one of the ultimate storytellers - and pushes it to its extreme, actually starting AT the end and then working backwards - which makes for one of the all-time greatest stories.<br /><br />Now, a lot of movies that are assembled in this kind of non-linear time-jumpy kind of way are gimmicky to a fault, and confusing for no good reason.  But in Memento, this style of editing actually serves the story and makes it better, because - by showing us Leonard's perpetually-perplexing world out of sequence - it forces us to experience the movie in the same disoriented way that Leonard experiences the world.  So as Leonard puzzles his way through his life, so do we.  This makes us empathize and connect with the film's central character in a way few other movies have ever been able to achieve before or since (whichever way you happen to travel through time in your search).  Of course, the fact the Guy Pearce's performance is so riveting helps us enormously with our empathy as well.<br /><br />Anyway, there are about a thousand (or so) other reviews here that will tell you more about what happens in the movie, but I think that this story - more than most - relies on the surprise that each new/past detail reveals, so I don't want to ruin any of this film's revelations if you are lucky enough to be contemplating seeing this movie for the first time.<br /><br />And if you are considering watching this picture for the first time (or even if you've already seen it), I would definitely encourage you to buy this DVD.  Because the great thing about owning a movie like Memento, as my experience will attest, is that it rewards multiple viewings.  And the depth and the detail (in addition to the design) of the film ensure that each viewing is made fresh with new insight and understanding.<br /><br />In the end, Memento is so much more than just a non-linear, well-crafted crime thriller.  It's also an exploration of what makes up a person's identity, and an examination of the malleability of experience.  Ultimately, Memento shows us how all our memories are fallible, and - to some degree - we all have to use devices like Leonard uses to remember things: whether it's jotting down phone numbers, taking pictures on our vacations, or (in my case just now) watching a DVD to remind you of all the things you loved about a movie in the first place.ences the world.

B0006L0LOS|3.0|It was a good, entertaining comic-book movie. Maybe comic-book flicks are supposed to be really deep nowadays, but this definitely isn't. It is entertaining and silly, though. It didn't deserve to get raked over the coals - its actually not bad.

B000BUYP4Q|4.0|Aside from setting a benchmark for other franchises (perhaps most notably 007) to follow, Batman Begins is a remarkably ambitious and mostly successful attempt to bring some real substance to the comic book genre beyond mere mood. It has a sense of the epic to it, as well as an awareness of the escalation of moral quandaries that come with taking the law into your own hands that haven't been seen in a big-budget summer picture since Clear and Present Danger. It's not just a case of a superhero fighting a supervillain either: the various mobsters, evil geniuses and crooked businessmen are all part of a much larger corruption that ensures that even a semblance of moral balance cannot be restored by the end credits as per other superhero flicks. Christopher Nolan even manages to get strong performances from actors who had long ago drifted into ham and volume like Gary Oldman and Rutger Hauer. It also has a few problems, not least the lack of depth in the photography or Nolan's deficiencies as an action director (not Michael Bay bad, but not particularly good either), but they're outweighed by the pluses.     The 2-disc set boasts an impressive array of extras (including numerous Easter Eggs), although the lovingly crafted comicbook art menu pages can get a little annoying to work your way through at times and it's a shame that only the brief teaser trailer has been included.
0099282410|5.0|Robert Harris puts academic has-been Fluke Kelso at the center of a tall tale with a solid foundation in the 'wild west' days of post-Soviet Russia. Hookers, mafia, a publicity-mad newshound, former Soviet tough guys, and modern Russian cops all play roles in this page-turner that delves back to the cult of Stalin - and brings that cult into today. The scariest thing about this book is that it's based partially in the reality that Stalin remains a shockingly popular figure in Russia today, which also lends the book an uncomfortable veneer of plausibility.<br /><br />I've read three of Harris's works now - Pompeii, Imperium, and Archangel. Contrary to some other reviewers, I enjoyed this book more than Pompeii and found it to be more of page-turner than Imperium (I thought Imperium was a bit more of a serious book - closer to literature than mass market paperback like Archangel).<br /><br />I suppose the ending, criticized by others as implausible, does require one to perform a sizeable suspended disbelief, but if you pull that off, the ending hangs together. It's just a creepy lot of fun to see how Professor Kelso is going to get out of this mess and the crazy company he's keeping.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000LC55F2|5.0|Christopher Nolan just seems to go from strength to strength. The Prestige may have inexplicably missed out on a screen writing nomination at the Oscars, but it's one of the best screen adaptations in years, its excellent and ingenious script displaying confidence both in its potentially outrageous material and its audiences' intelligence, hiding all the answers in plain sight from the very first shot. Even the dialogue pulls off the triple feat of being rich with double meanings which repay repeat viewing, right for each scene it appears in and, far from being clever just for the sake of it, naturally furthering the plot and the characters in entertaining and intriguing ways. But then, half the trick is making it look effortless (although in an inversion of that, both the film's on screen magicians are so accomplished they have to make their illusions look harder than they are to get the audience's approval).     Either deceptively elaborate or deceptively simple (either definition applies, and each in their most positive sense), Christopher Nolan's tale of duelling magicians manages to be both highly entertaining and surprisingly dark: this isn't a war of words, but one where people get hurt, fingers get lost, people die. The film is full of mirroring and doubling, so it's not surprising that the magicians' feud mirrored by Nikola Tesla's equally dangerous feud with Thomas Edison over the electricity that may or may not be the key to the mystery - if there even is a mystery.     Magic is the perfect metaphor for both storytelling and movie-making - in a way the film could almost be an allegory about why movie buffs usually make the worst movies. Each protagonist is an incomplete man in every sense of the word. Bale has the genius but not the ability to sell his illusions to an audience. Jackman has the showmanship but not the originality to create a truly great trick. In the middle is Michael Caine's ingeneur, the backstage genius with the surprisingly unconvincing cockney accent (too many years of high living, Michael?), caught somewhere between director and ghost writer in the scheme of things.     Not that it's without flaws. It is perhaps too easy to guess Bale's big personal secret simply by the manner Nolan chooses to shoot certain shots, although there are more than enough twists not for it to matter too much if you don't get them all. And, in another part that shows up Scarlet Johannson's weaknesses as an actress, the nominal leading lady is effortlessly outshone by Rebecca Hall and, yes, Piper Perabo in smaller roles. Still, Nolan does manage to pull off the amazing feat of getting an excellent performance out of David Bowie, through the obvious-now-you-think-about-it technique of focussing on the singer's voice as much as his natural presence.     Ultimately, it's a film that could be about everything or about absolutely nothing, one that is either led entirely by plot contrivances or one where the themes and storytelling dictate the characters' actions far more than credibility, and where the biggest trick is that ultimately there is no trick. All interpretations seem equally valid, which is part of the fun. And best of all, it's a delight to watch.     The DVD extras are, for once on a Nolan film, disappointingly mundane, but it's worth picking up for the film itself.
B00005JPOE|2.0|The target audience for this Michael Apted directed sleeper, best I can tell, are probably any reluctant conservatives out there who are in the market for the experience of, for just once, being on the side of something right and just. \\"Look honey, not only are they against slavery, but they are for free education! I'm lovin' this being a liberal thing.\\" As I've stated before, anybody can beat up on a conquered issue but it takes one brave soul to go after a pressing issue of the day. We need more movies like \\"Road to Guantanamo\\" and fewer movies like this. And there really is no mistaking who this film is aimed at. It is a throwback to the early 90's art house, when they were filled almost exclusively with little old ladies and proper entertainment like this. So as we wait around to see if slavery is actually abolished we get to watch rich white people enjoying their mansions. Our hero William Wilberforce (Ioan Gruffudd) flirts with a girl two times just so that they can justify throwing a wedding up on screen. We get death bed scenes that spew the virtue of faith. And we get a happy ending that is happy because it results in procreation. Yeehaw!<br /><br />I pick on my dad a lot because he refuses to see costume dramas (\\"Take and adventure\\" I say) but he does have a point, these things always tend to be stale. At the center of the story is William, who we learn led the charge in England to do away with the grand tradition of forced labor. It is a whitewash as Williams appears as saintly as can be which means that he is not a character but an ideal. He builds a coalition, collects signatures, and battles a very neutered opposition led by Ciaran Hinds and Toby Jones (or Julius Caesar and Truman Capote if you prefer). There is no drama because we know how history turns out, and since the characters are either bad or good we can't turn to them for excitement either. There is some sly humor mixed in, but unfortunately most of the jokes were duds (although I'm sure the gag where he pops out of the slave box killed with those aforementioned little old ladies). So there I was, stuck watching a movie that had no interest in doing anything so as not to offend anybody.<br /><br />I do find it disheartening that this film did so much better at the box office than Apted's last film \\"49 Up\\" ($19 million to $240,000) because that one was so much more intelligent than this one. Of course viewing habits in this country are disgraceful and the people only seem interested in showing up if you pander to them. In the middle of the film William tricks a bunch of stuffy pro-slave types into listening to his speech by promising them one thing and then delivering another. This gave me hope that, maybe possibly, Apted would pull a similar trick and deliver an unforeseen shot to the audience. But no such luck. On the plus side it does take a loving look at a true act of bravery in the campaign for equal rights for all. And Ciaran Hinds is always a welcome face. Still, those who are unseasoned in the art of sitting quietly through something of this type should stay home because it is exactly what the preview makes it out to be. I have no doubt that Apted's intentions were pure when he sat down to make \\"Amazing Grace\\" I just feel that somewhere along the way it turned into one big back patting session for Americans everywhere. **1/4e gag where he pops out of the slave box killed with those aforementioned little old ladies).

B00005JP97|3.0|One can't help but feel like a disappointed sideshow customer at the end of Black Snake Moan. Instead of two hours of demented sleaze as promised by the publicity (Christina Ricci chained to a radiator in her underwear!), it's yet another Magic Negro movie, in which a wise, asexual black man solves the white folks' problems. Despite the naughty language and the blues music on the soundtrack, Black Snake Moan is an incredibly undaring movie, the kind you go to see with your parents in order to get out of the house on Thanksgiving weekend (especially since elderly PBS viewers are the only people left who still listen to the blues).
0618477942|5.0|I've read all of Ms. Bechdel's \\"Dykes to Watch Out For\\" books and always watch for her monthly column (when I can find it). But I had no idea that she had the depth, insight, and clarity that is found in \\"Fun Home.\\"<br /><br />Of course, her delightful drawings are in evidence, as are her warm sense of humor and generous heart. But it's the searing anecdotes that have stayed with me - the trips to NYC, the thunderstorm, the yard boys, the college experiences. All speak so truthfully and with such universality that I thought I was reading about my own family.<br /><br />I don't know how long Ms. Bechdel was working on this book, but it is such an important contribution to the genre of memoirs that she could have spent a lifetime and I wouldn't be surprised. As soon as I finished reading it, I opened the book to the first page and reread it immediately. I know I will return to this book many times in the years to come.
B000N6TX1I|4.0|Although I liked the movie my advice would be to read the book by P.D James first. After having done so I knew right away what was going on as well as noticing the obvious ommissions. Others in the theatre seemed lost at first, but the plot is explained slowly not overwhelmingly. Children of Men presents us with a future that is not only plausible, it may be phrophetic. There are no laser guns, flying cars or silly alien characters. Having been filmed in the U.K it isn't ruined by the inclusion of a Hollywood pretty-boy as lead character. The action is non-stop and the story never drags right up to the final moment.
B000001ZS3|5.0|I really enjoyed this when I was a kid, many moons ago. It still does it for me.  <br />It was composed when the complex synth systems were emerging. What makes this work unique is not that it was one of the first, but that it is a lovely arrangement that offers an exploration of the medium. There are layered levels of musical complexity that when combined somehow do not overwhealm. I recommend you take the time in a quiet room with headphones and LISTEN. There is a lot to be found in the stereo mix.  <br />Enjoy!
B000MXPE7O|5.0|A great film to watch on a rainy night and worth owning.  <br />This one reminds me of \\"The spy who came in from the Cold\\" and would have been even better in black & white. Enjoyed it tremendously. <br />
B0007MWZEK|4.0|Update 1 year later;  believe what everyone is saying about the battery...it does not last and will not hold a charge after a few months of normal use....and the rollers are a complete pain to clean...don't let them go too far or you will never get them cleaned out totally!!<br /><br />After reading several reviews I was still compelled to purchase the product!  And after one use I was not totally disappointed.  Granted I did not expect too much from it, it surprisingly performed amazingly well.  And the better news is that it seemed to work better the 2nd and 3rd time!  I don't know how.  I have 3 dogs, 2 large and one small but they are always bringing mud and dirt into the house and on the furniture.  I have several throw rugs thru-out the house also.  I found that the Swivel Sweeper had just enough power to pick up (fluff up) my throw rugs without eating them as my regular vacumn does.  I did not have any problems picking up dirt or having it throw it around the floor.  I think if you take your time it will pick up the larger items....just like sweeping with a broom, you want to take your time!  Another trick I found is that if you DON'T clean the rollers the dirt won't get thrown out either...there is more gunk to hold it in the sweeper!!!  I have sheets thrown over my sofa and bed for the dogs and again it has just enough power to get the dirt but not eat the sheets.  Overall I am satisfied with the product...I usually am gentle with my appliances so I don't forsee the handle breaking as mentioned in some reviews.  I found it to be just as or more sturdy than a typical Swifter brand.  I just hope the battery makes it to 6 months as suggested.
B000002KDO|4.0|One can chart the rise and fall of every band that ever was simply by listening to each album in chronilogical order.  1971's Master Of Reality is the very start of Black Sabbath's decline.  Why?  Because they would never reach the masterpiece level that was Paranoid ever again and the excesses of popularity would start to infiltrate the members of the band.  Money, drugs & egos were on the rise.  After their second album, they would always be reaching for that pinnacle that was Paranoid. Is Master Of Reality a bad album?  Absolutely not!  This is one of the heaviest albums of all time.  But it's lacking.  Sorry to say it, but it's true.  There is a lot of experimentation here, which isn't always a bad thing, but you can feel the changing of power from Ozzy as the frontman/singer to Iommi.  Sad little instrumental outings start to pop up on Master where before they were just jam sessions by the whole bad.  Iomm needs the world to realize how great he is and he's showcasing it.  Where in later years Eddie Van Halen would do the same thing on all the early Van Halen albums, Master Of Reality is the beginning of the rift that would eventually tear Sabbath apart.  Singer vs. Guitarist.<br /><br />Sweet Leaf - The coughing intro is perfect.  One of the glorious Sabbath classics that will be forever remembered.  A great song about smoking dope.  The riff is infectious. Beautiful.<br /><br />After Forever - Sraight-ahead rocker.  The Sabbath sound had culminated ino a living entity.  Everything they did had their indelible print right on it.  You could hear a song and say, yeah, that's Sabbath.  \\"Would you like to see the Pope at the end of a rope?\\"  The lyrics are hilarious.  This is actually the first pro-God Sabbath tune.  Were they trying to clean up their Satanic image?  Most assuredly.<br /><br />Embryo - Tony Iommi doing volume swells on his SG.  Innovative?  Perhaps at the time.  This is just a little 30 second show off.  Not very necessary, but kinda cool.<br /><br />Children Of The Grave - An anti-nuclear war tune that became a Sabbath classic.  Great guitar riff.  Ozzy is great here.  Must the world live in the shadow of atomic fear?  Yeah!<br /><br />Orchid - Lethargic, heavy-handed accoustic instrumental that shows Iommi being incredibly repetitive.  Yawn! Another nail in the coffin.  Iommi's ego is starting to show through.  He needs attention. Dig me, I'm the guitar player! In the live shows of later years, Ozzy was off to the left while Iommi was at center stage.  That is not good.<br /><br />Lord Of This World - Great tune.  Ozzy belts it out.  The dreary, heavy riff is hypnotic.  Very Sabbath! Almost to the point where they have started to repeat themselves.  Some of the riffs here sound strangely familiar.  Still a good tune.<br /><br />Solitude - Strangely reminiscent of Planet Caravan.  Going against the grain of Black Sabbath.  This shows the Sabs trying to experiment with their sound, moving away from the traditional pounding rock.  The flute is creepy.  Ponderous.  Dragging.  Not one of their better songs.<br /><br />Into The Void - Back to Sabbath's signature crunchy sludge sound.  Into The Void is a sci-fi song Black Sabbath style. One of the better songs here.<br /><br />Overall,  Master Of Reality was a choppy outing for the Sabs.  Too many show-off Iommi moments.  Playing around with their sound.  There are classics here in Sweet Leaf and Children Of The Grave, as well as some overlooked gems.  But the content is mixed not flowing.  Were they trying to hard?  Maybe a little.  A classic  Sure.  Just not as classic as Paranoid.<br /><br />Dig it!. <br /> <br />Children Of The Grave - An anti-nuclear war tune that became a Sabbath classic.  Great guitar riff.  Ozzy is great here.

1416914285|1.0|I normally love fantasy, and I couldn't force myself to read past the halfway mark. <br /> <br />There was stilted dialogue, and flat main characters. Let's not forget the cringeworthy visual metaphors! Or the plot that seems like a bizarre lovechild of Rowling and Joss Whedon. <br /> <br />I don't know; the rest of the novel could be the best thing ever. Somehow, though, I doubt it, especially when supposed fans claim the characters are dull through the end of the novel.
B000002KHH|5.0|The span between their debut album and Paranoid was not very long (a little less than a year) but the difference was huge.  All the grinding, powerful riffs from their 1st album had been refined and tightened and the legend that was Blak Sabbath became solidified here on their classic sophomore effort.  Paranoid has so many truly great Sabbath classics that even the lesser tunes here are overshadowed by their greatness, erasing the few spots of mediocrity.  Originally to be titled War Pigs (hence the pink guy on the cover wth the sword and shield)this is the epoch of hard, dark, killer rock.  Moving forward from here Sabbath would never fully capture the greatness of Paranoid. If there ever was a must-have heavy metal album, this is it!  I grew up listening to this as a kid in the early 70s and I gotta tel ya, these songs are imprinted in my soul!<br /><br />War Pigs/Luke's Wall -  Orginally titled Walpurgis(The Witches Sabbath) with completely different lyrics (hear the original on Ozzy's The Ozzman Cometh) Sabbath felt the whole Satanic thing was getting too out of hand.  New lyrics and new title.  This is one of the greatest heavy metal songs of all time!  Absolutely perfect. I can never get tired of hearing it.  Tight, cohesive, astounding!  A true classic!<br /><br />Paranoid - This is Black Sabbath's signature song. Straight-forward rocker.  Actually only made it on the album because they needed another song to round out the playing time.  Ended up being the title of the album, even though the cover is geared to War Pigs, which was going to be the original title.  Wow.  A filler tune that became great.  Who would have guessed?  Ozzy to this day stil ends his shows with this Sabbath clssic.<br /><br />Planet Caravan - This weird little tune actually grows on you to the point where you wind up liking it.  Stange effects on Ozzy's voice make him unrecongnizable.  Eerie.  Haunting. Not their best, but cool enough to garner a Pantera cover years later.  Iommi's playing here is mature and melodic. Experimental Sabbath.<br /><br />Iron Man - Another Sabbath classic!  There are so many here! This became a car comercial jingle last year. Pounding. Metal.  In-your-face riff.  Another truly great tune. I AM IRON MAN!<br /><br />Electric Funeral -  Often overlooked, Electric Funeral is a great song.  The riff makes your head swim and the lyrics are kinda cheesy, but this song rocks.  Dark, politically-angry, sci-fi metal goodness!<br /><br />Hand Of Doom - Starts off mellow and moves along into a rocker.  About addiction and anti-Vietnam sentiments and, well.... Death & Destruction!  One of my personal favorites and another often overlooked song.<br /><br />Rat Salad - If Paranoid were said to have a weak point, Rat Salad would be it.  Nothing more than an instrumental to showcase Sabbath's jamming skills and Bill Ward's drumming prowess.  But...it still \\"Rocks out loud!\\" as my younger daughter would say.  And it showed us something as well: that Bill Ward was a highly-underrated drummer.  At a time were everyone was hailing John Bonham and Keith Moon and such as the essential rock drummers, Ward was strangely absent from the list of greats.<br /><br />Jack The Stripper/Fairies Wear Boots - Yet another Sabbath classic!  The lyrics are funny!  I'm sorry, but they are.  Still, this is a great song where most last songs on albums weren't.  'Cause smokin' & trippin' are all that you do.... Yeah!  Hilarious.  Classic.<br /><br />Overall, this is Sabath's most coherent, cohesive effort  Their perfect album. With so many staple songs on one recording, how can one not realize that this is the Bible of heavy Metal Albums!  Ozzy, Tony, Geezer & Bill became the Godfathers of Metal with Paranoid.

B000002KB8|4.0|Most people would herald Black Sabbth's self-titled debut as the true birth of the Heavy Metal genre and they're probably right.  Here were are treated to some of the heaviest, most darkly-clad hard rock of all time.  Recorded in 1969 in a little back-street studio in Birmingham in a 24-hour period, the newly dubbed Black Sabbath (formerly called Earth)took their year of pub-playing and tedious practicing and transfered it to vinyl.  This is near perfection.<br /><br />Black Sabbath - One of the all-time classic heavy tunes.  Their signature song (along with Paranoid).  Thunder and rain.  Churchbells ringing.  They set the tone for destruction, doom & devil-tinged macabre.<br /><br />Wasp/Behind The Wall Of Sleep/Bassically/N.I.B. - The better of the two song suites that grace Black Sabbath.  Filled with great, memorable riffs.  Ozzy belts through the mixed lyrics while Iommi shreds. May have been more coherent as individual songs.  Bassically is Geezer showing off. The best part of this is N.I.B. Many think that this stands for Nativity In Black, but Ozzy said it was actually a nickname for Sabbah drummer Bill Ward.  Nib, because his beard looked like the nib of a fountain pen.  Someone added the periods to make it look like an acronym and bingo, a rock myth is born.  The riff is heavy and hooking.  This is shades of Sabbath to come.  Iommi is one of the great riff-writers of  all time.  My name is Lucifer...please take my hand.<br /><br />The Wizard - Ozzy on harmoica  A playful, rocking sorcery tune. This was a long-time Sabbath staple.  Another driving riff by Iommi.  Classic.<br /><br />Wicked World - One of my personal favorites.  Iommi kicks out the jams and the steamroller that was Sabbath takes over.  Heavy, dark, and shredding.  This is a great song!<br /><br />A Bit Of Finger/Sleeping Village/Warning - The other song suite on Black Sabbath.  At over 14 minutes, this was is lttle too ponderous.  The accoustic into to Sleeping Village with Ozzy's haunting singing is eerie but to light.  Into A Bit Of Finger (don't ask me why they labeled Sleeping Village second when it's the first part of the song????) which is just Iommi jamming along with the band.  It rocks but for a little too long.  Seems like an impromptu jam session recorded for posterity.  Shrouded in pounding riffs with inteludes of creepiness.  Back to lyrics.  Then back to jamming.  The problem with this song suite is that it's very hard to ascertain what is what. It's one very long mixed song and that's hard to digest.  Where the previous suite was broken down into distinct sections, this is garbled.<br /><br />Overall, one of the greatest Heavy Metal albums of all time, and perhaps it's starting point.  But it's not perfect simply because the last 14+ minutes is too dreary.  Paranoid would refine the Sabbath sound to perfection sans the expanded jam sessions.  Dark, creepy, filled with every killer, pounding riff you could ask for.  Black Sabbath sounded like a band that worked very hard at crafting their material well and built up a tightness with tons of constant practice.  They honed their music playing live in the pubs of Birmingham and then recorded it for all the world to hear.

B000A6T1KE|3.0|Closing out another chapter in the epic universe that is the Star Trek franchise wasn't going to be easy because of the huge amount of Geek-Fan scrutiny.  No show that had/has that kind of fanbase was/is ever going to end in a way that all the fans will appreciate.Never going to happen!!!!Not LOST. Not Battlestar Galactica. Not 24.  Not The X-Files.  And certaininly not Star Trek The Next Generation.  The newer version of the exploits & adventures of Kirk & Spock, TNG was definitely more PC and yet still had alot of guts.  The SFX department had definitely improved and once the old Star Trek fans embraced TNG there was no looking back.  So,  as with the death of Kirk in the abomination that was Generations, the end of TNG wasn't ever going to satisfy everybody.  Or anbody.<br /><br />On the way to Troi & Riker's honeymoon, the crew of the Enterprise pick up a positronic signature from a planet near the netral zone, actually in Romulan space, that could only be that of an Android like Data.  They head down to a planet and pick up the pieces of a prototype of Dr. Noonian Soong that appears to be an early version of Data.  Meanwhile, the new Praetor of the Romulan Empire Shinzon,  sends word that peace is to be made between the Romulans and the rest of the Federation.  Another swing about to visit the planet of Romulus.  Shinzon is the clone of Captain Picard.  In actulity, he needs Picard's genetic materal because he's breaking down.  Apparently the Romulan technique of cloning leaves much to be desired.  Was Data's  android brother a plant by the Romulans to get the Enterprise into Romulan space?  Is Shinzon a psychotic puppet madman bent on the destruction of the entire Federation?  Do the Romulans plan to destroy Earth?  All signs point to YES!<br /><br />The movie is visually stunning as any Star Trek movie should be.  But the plot is weak and there is just an air of forboding encoded in each scene that leaves even the casual Star Trek TNG fan with a bad taste in their mouth.  Killing off a main character, a beloved character (Data), to signify the end of a series always seemed so ludicrous to me.  I can't imagine why the makers of TNG would want to leave their fans with that kind of morbid, thought-melting ending.  The fans want closure.  Not chaos.  Overall, Nemesis could have been done with more enthusiasm and originality.  Like I said, with that Geek-Critical fanbase, not everyone was going to be happy with the end results.  It seemed to me that the makers of the film didn't try very hard to please anyone at all.<br /><br />Dig It!in their mouth.

B000005ALN|5.0|What an album. Easily one of my favorites. It's one that deserves to be listened to on a high end music system. I have my albums that I like on my iPod, or in the car. This is one I like to dedicate my time to without distractions. Bought it the day it came out and has only gotten better with time. My musical tastes usually fall within the electronic/downbeat domain (Air, Boards of Canada, Herbert, Fila Brazilla, Autechre..etc) I do own Listen Without Prejudice, but Older is a much more sophisticated, well rounded album. Mr. Michael's vocals are smooth and lush. First review I've ever done on Amazon, couldn't have picked a better album to start with.

0395083621|4.0|If you can get past all the extraneous material (such as the highly negative introduction and footnotes) which seem to be working overtime to make sure you *don't* like this book, you will find it to contain many truly inspiring pieces of political wisdom, put forward with a rhetorical flair and energy that keep you turning the pages, even if you may not agree with everything he states. There's nothing \\"tortured\\" about the prose at all (try reading Spengler -- there's some tortured prose for you.) Of course, Hitler was writing as an ordinary, self-educated man: he makes no claim to be an academic or even a professional writer. We must remember that this was written in 1925 while he was imprisoned for political activism. He had served bravely in the disastrous Great War of 1914-1918, was severely wounded, no doubt saw many of his buddies killed on the front lines -- only to come home to economic and political chaos and despair. That would be enough to make any man highly angry and bitter. But Hitler didn't just sit around and mope, he did something about it; he became active in politics and put forward a philosophy that, though it has its detractors, is still \\"controversial\\" eighty years later. And despite the hypocrisy of those who publish this book (repeating how badly written it's supposed to be), it's still a worldwide bestseller, so *someone* must be reading it. And the publishers don't mind cashing the checks either -- if they were sincere they would put it into the public domain and wash their hands of it. BTW: go for the new black cover edition -- it's a huge aesthetic improvement over that really ugly old orange edition.
B000002UYZ|5.0|These CDs sound great and are great sounds.  If you do not have any Beatles yet and you know you will not buy all of their CDs then get this and it's blue brother 1967-70 and you can't go wrong.  This album has a special place in my heart.  I got the 8-track tapes back in 1973 when they came out and played them over and over and over.  IMHO these are the best songs released in the first half of the 1960s by anyone.  The state of Rock n Roll was on life support when these guys hit the scene in 1964 in the USA at least.  They jump started RnR all over again and the rest is history.  Like I said these are the best of the best so get these if you get anything.  Rock on.  Jim in So Cal.

B00005JPCF|1.0|As a conservationist, and a lover of movies, I was expecting a wonderful experience from watching this movie. I was sorely disappointed. The movie did wildlife a huge disservice by casting leopard seals and killer whales as little more than evil predators. Neither species is evil. Both do what they have evolved to do. Lending some moral superiority to penguins which eat fish (and hence is a predator), while not extending the same respect to seals and whales is wrong-headed at best. It confused my nephew and caused him to want to kill whales and seals. All in all, a huge waste of time. Plus the mexican slurs provided by Robin Williams should have been removed, very insensitive. Plus, I must add it also supports the sterotype of the traditional dad as little more than a close-minded fool. Avoid this like the plague. Oh, not enough music for me. Very sad!!!
0486282112|5.0|Somehow, 175 years after it was first written, this story keeps holding our attention. Not just that, it says more to our modern world than it ever said before.<br /><br />Popularized versions of this story lack all the depth of Shelley's original. Yes, her monster was physically huge, powerful, and respulsive. In her version, though, he's a thinking, feeling, and deeply intelligent person. He is deeply hurt by the universal, unreasoning loathing that judges only his face - even from the man who created him. The creation has a majestic capacity for affection but, in a credible transformation of emotional alchemy, that whole capacity turns to rage. He is not an image of hate, but a mirror of it.<br /><br />The hubristic biotechnologist has an immediacy today that Shelley could scarcely have imagined. So, I think, does the vengeful lashing out by people who feel they have suffered grievous wrongs, leading to a deadly spiral of increasing hatred by all parties. I just hope that current readers will take the time needed to absorb this book properly - it was never paced for today's ADD-driven generation.<br /><br />//wiredweird

For me, a bargain at twice the price. <br /> <br />
B00005V9IJ|3.0|When Tom Hanks cuts his hands while trying to start a fire, he screams and puts his hand up towards the camera as if to say \\"see I cut my hand just so you know what is going on\\", very cheesy moment.<br /><br />Other things that took away from the film are: how coincidental that one of the boxes was a ball. He uses this ball to explain key things in the plot since there is no other way to explain it. How convenient one of the boxes contained ice skates, he later used for cutting coconuts. Also the VHS tapes supplied rope for his raft.<br /><br />Other than this, a very entertaining film. 3 1/2 stars.<br /><br />p.s. why is that top reviewers have like 9 paragraphs explaining every detail of the film? DO we need 200 reviews that are identical?
B000N3ST8O|4.0|Who knew Stevie Nicks was so funny?  This entire collection is worth the money if only for the DVD commentary.   Stevie laughs at herself throughout the 80's, makes fun of her hair, clothes, and that ridiculous treadmill in \\"Stand Back.\\"  It's a joy just to spend time with her as she explains the stories behind her songs and videos.  Very honest and bittersweet.   However, the highlight of the DVD is the making of Bella Donna footage.  To see her having fun, flirting, and laying down the vocals for this seminal album is a rare gift.   And if you want to see and hear a woman at the top of game, watch the final take of \\"After the Glitter Fades.\\"  You can feel her singing for every woman in music who came before her.   <br /> <br />The CD collection itself is a good mix.  Mostly singles, it's a nice compilation for those interested in her music.  In the live tracks, she is in much better form than in the last Fleetwood Mac tour.  One of her greatest solo tracks, \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" is missing, but available elsewhere.   But for those really looking to hear her greatest songwriting, the Enchanted boxset features so much more.   Now all we need is a collection of all her work with Fleetwood Mac.  She remains the most enduring artist from the group, and Mick would do well to  honor her many years with Fleetwood Mac:  \\"Rhiannon\\" \\"Landslide\\" \\"Dreams\\" \\"Gold Dust Woman\\" \\"I Don't Wanna Know\\" \\"Silver Springs\\" \\"Storms\\" \\"Angel\\" \\"Beautiful Child\\" \\"Sisters of the Moon\\" \\"Sara\\" \\"Gypsy\\" \\"Fireflies\\" \\"Straight Back\\" \\"That's Alright\\" \\"Seven Wonders\\" \\"When I See You Again\\" \\"Welcome to the Room, Sara\\" \\"Freedom\\"  \\"Second Time\\" \\"Affairs of the Heart\\" \\"No Questions Asked\\" \\"Paper Doll\\" \\"Goodbye Angel.\\"  Put them all together.
B000AARKOO|4.0|This is a very entertaining DVD, full of action with very well constructed and filmed battle scenes of great scope. In some ways the film is very timely considering that there is a tension between the current Western civilization of America and Europe and the Islamic world that stretches across Asia. I found it interesting that the film depicts those Christians who are tolerant of a multicultural and diverse nation with those Christians that are not tolerant of other's religious beliefs. In this film, Balian (played by Orlando Bloom), his father, and the king of Jerusalem ( a pitiful leper hiding behind a silver mask) represent those forces that can live with diversity of spiritual beliefs.  The Templar Knights represent those forces that can not live with diversity and multiculturalism for it threatens them. In this film, the Muslims are a powerful military force that also is diverse in tolerance or non-tolerance for Christians. It is a beautiful film, with fascinating architecture, set construction, and weapon and costume design. The battle for the city of Jerusalem is exciting, a dramatic high point, and a critical aspect of the film. Saladin wins the battle and Jerusalem is handed over to the Muslims. Remember that after the death of Jesus, the apostles and disciples spread Christianity into Egypt and Ethiopia, into Rome, France, Spain, England, and Ireland. Also Christianity was spread into Eastern Europe such as Romania, Hungary, Germany. Christianity was spread into present day Syria, Jordan, Iraq, and Iran. Thus the sweep of Islam across the world in around the year 600 brought Islam to Christian communities and cities across the Middle East. It is in response to this growing Islamic power and dominance over the Middle East for 700 years that the Crusades were waged - which is a primary theme of the film. Yet this is not a Christians hate Muslims who in turn hate Christians type of film. Instead the writers and film-makers imply that the Kingdom of Heaven isattainable here on earth through the belief in tolerance for other's beliefs about God. This is actually a good message for our day and time - which director Ridley Scott obviously knows.
1594200823|5.0|I won't go on for pages like some of the reviews below.  I will simply say this:  I read roughly two books a week (although this thick on took me a bit longer, admittedly).  This book has changed my thinking more than any other non-fiction book I've read in recent memory, and I ALREADY was eating mostly organic.  I have recommended it to everyone I know, and now I recommend it to you.  Read it-- and although it might take you a while-- it's worth it.  You'll never eat quite the same way again.
B000JJRIN4|1.0|This is simply the worst, most inconsistent sellout album ever!  I will find a way to retract this statement someday.  There has to be something.  I got it:  all Milly Vanilly and Monkees[[ASIN:B0000033O3 The Monkees - Greatest Hits]] records--no, nevermind, THEY WERE ALWAYS THAT FAKE.  Why am I about to say, \\"Why couldn't she be more like [[ASIN:B000H305U0 FutureSex / LoveSounds]]Justin Timberlake[[ASIN:B00006JO4Q Justified]]?\\".  What I mean is:  she used to be good in the band and is bad now, he used to be in a bad band and is good now.<br /><br />Gwen Stefani is a complete joke and she has completely lost her credibility in musicianship and all of my respect for her (which was mistakenly quite high).  I even defended her side about the break-up of No Doubt, but this is rediculous.  She is completely terrible now.  Her husband Gavin Rossdale (formerly of Bush) should completely resent his decision to be her husband except for her looks (he has $--so so what about this much more).<br /><br />As for the album:  did I mention INCONSISTENT.  No two songs sound alike.  The only way you like them all is if you just love her voice, however, I do and i still hate most of them.<br /><br />Good luck in the future, I hope you create some good work, this is not that.  By the way, I hate the lead single (and the second, sweet escape, though mostly an empty track, has some upside to it).
B000MXPE74|5.0|To say that Scottish trio The Fratellis have had a meteoric rise in the last year is not too far from the truth. One the strength of several irresistable singles, the band released its debut album in the UK last Fall, and promptly saw it go platinum, not unlike the Arctic Monkeys just before them. Even that might not have been enough to put them on the musical map in the US, but then iTunes used of their songs for another one of their irresistable TV commercials. That was enough to then merit an offical US release of the album.<br /><br />\\"Costello Music\\" (13 tracks, 43 min.) packs a whole lot of energy in a short amount of time. The album opener (and 2nd UK single) \\"Henrietta\\" immediately sets the tone with its opening guitar riff, and off we go. It is followed by \\"Flathead\\" (5th UK single), which is that super-catchy song used by iTunes. \\"Whistle for the Choir\\" (4th UK single) is one of the few slower songs on the collection. \\"Chelsea Digger\\" (3rd UK single) is yet another hard to resits stomp-along song. \\"Creeping Up the Backstairs\\" (1st UK single) is yet another outstanding track, followed by my favorite track on the album, \\"Everybody Knows You Cried Last Night\\", which somehow has not yet been selected as a single. The band does not let up, even towards the end of the album. \\"Baby Fratelli\\" (6th UK single) is another exclamation point on the album, with an 70s-like sounding chorus. If I had to compare the feel of this album to anything, it would be to Travis' debut album \\"Good Feeling\\", and that's a compliment.<br /><br />There is not a minute of fat or excess on this album. Every song and every guitar riff belongs, and the album sounds like a greatest hits album, frankly. The Fratellis are touring the US shortly, and I will have a chance to see them here in Cincinnati, I can't wait for that. Meanwhile, this album is highly recommended. Buy it, you won't regret it,
B000J3OTSM|4.0|Channing Tatum as Tyler Gage gives a great performance in this fun movie. The basic idea is a bit contrived, but it works: a no-gooder teenager with a knack for rap is reluctantly coopted by a beautiful dancer in need of a partner. He will of course help her jazz up her act, she will make him a better man, and they will fall in love. Aside from annoying zigzags in Tyler's commitment (one slip is OK, but three?!), the script pulls us in. It is helped by a lot of dancing, not always great but always energetic. Rachel Griffiths is excellent in the minor role of the principal of the art school.
B000002UAO|1.0|I saw this album on sale on CD Now recently and purchased it to help round out my Beatles collection.  What a disappointment !  It bears little resemblance the the album of the same name released in the U.S. in 1965.  In this \\"import\\" version, the original first song, \\"I've Just Seen a Face,\\" is completely missing.  What a bummer, since it set the tone for a great album.  Unless you can find the original, don't buy this for posterity.  There are some good songs, but it's not the album I grew up with.  Sad !
0380789035|5.0|Gaiman as writer can be somewhat inconsistent, although he has a justifiably decent reputation, mostly due to his comics work on Sandman.  But what a lot of folks don't remember that for all the brilliance of Sandman, it wasn't perfect, with the moments of greatness countered with anticlimaxes and the feeling that he was showing you a lot of cool things in lieu of an actual plot.  His post-Sandman comics work has sort of borne that out, with both 1602 and The Eternals, while better than a lot of other comics, kind of \\"okay\\" as compared to his previous standards and matched or equalled by a lot of other comics work out there.  Which may just mean that the bar Gaiman set a long time ago is being hit by more and more people, but it does make his own work suffer in comparison.  He's been able to carry over his fanbase into his novel work, and then some (there are not enough people reading comics in the US to make anything a NY Times Bestseller) with stories in the same vein as Sandman, fantasy tales with a touch of reality, a penchant for inventive concepts and the occasional dose of horror (I think Sandman was at its best when it functioned as a horror comic, disturbing and like nothing else on the shelves from a major publisher).  Neverwhere, the first of his novels I read, I thought was decent without being spectacular, venturing too close to the \\"show you cool ideas\\" side of things but forgetting to actually making me care about the characters.  Gaiman rectifies the problem somewhat in American Gods, but also dumps an interesting concept of top of that to keep you entertained.  The story follows an recently paroled ex-con named Shadow, who gets out of prison to discover his wife dead and himself in the hire of a mysterious man named Wednesday who seems to know him all too well.  Wednesday, as it turns out, is the Norse god Odin, and before long Shadow is caught up in a shadow war between the gods of old who are now living in America, and the new American gods of technology.  By mixing his mythologies something fierce, it allows for Gaiman to produce a fascinatingly quirky cast of characters, his reinterpretations of the gods for the modern world are interesting, making them both godly and human, immortal and flawed, trapped in a new country that could care less about them anymore, as they desperately vie for power, knowing that with each generation their ability to hang on grows less and less.  The plotting of the book is best described as loose and ramshackle, getting back to Gaiman's favorite \\"travelogue\\" aspect of writing, with Shadow crisscrossing the country and going to so-called sites of power, seeing the ways in which the gods still interact with the world . . . but Gaiman's powers of misdirection are much more in evidence here, you may wonder why everything in this book too six hundred pages, but you won't wonder that while you're reading it because he keeps the plot moving swiftly enough and chances locales often enough that you won't be bored.  What helps is that he chooses Shadow as the emotional focus of the book, and not the gods themselves (who are interesting but a bit one-dimensional at times, bar a few, but then that's probably true of most historical gods) and while Shadow seems to take things just a little too much in stride at times, his subtle growth over the course of the novel, his relationship with his dead wife and how he interacts with people helps the reader connect to the book even when all the god-talk and mythological references start to make your eyes glaze over.  None of this helps the puff of a climax, but if you've been reading Gaiman for a while you know that he excels in the smaller moments and not the huge bombastic ones.  A step forward from Neverwhere and at its best recalling the mix of fantasy and horror that characterized Sandman at its best, this is probably the place you want to go to after devouring his comic epic, if you're still looking for more.hnology.

B000MTPANQ|5.0|What can I say. Truly one of Neils genuine from the heart to the people sessions. Neil has always connected with his audiences, and has been a welcome staple. The DVD was awesome as well. I am a throwback to the 70's, and seeing people and things from the 70's, including Neil doing probably the most original Old Man video, was the type of thing that gives a man goosebumps.<br /><br />Peace from Tucson,<br /><br />Mark
B000N3ST8O|5.0|This is a very solid compilation.It comes with a DVD and a booklet with photos which makes it a great buy for the money.
B000002GQH|5.0|This is another Moody Blues masterpiece.  it ranks in my eyes right by their ultimate achievement: \\"To our Children's Children's Children.\\"<br /><br />Few in my generation have not experienced the magic of this album.  Every song on it is gold, and the continuity between the songs is perfect.  The blending of classic orchestral instruments and rock and roll instruments is perfection.  Every ballad is a work of beauty.<br /><br />To feel good being seranaded by harmonizing voices blended with rich sonic tapestries is the delight of the Moody Blues that will never become outdated.
B000MXPE7O|2.0|As quite a number of other reviewers have said, here we have (unfortunately) a film brimming with good intentions, executed by first-rate people...that trudges along through the dreary, grey lives of some very unlikeable WASP blueblood types (the Yale/Skull & Bones set) who grow to adulthood taking for granted that they will occupy the privileged positions of power in the American political aristocracy.  Here we have the Chips, the Chazzes, the Chets, and the Skippers of the Polo-shirt set, along with their clench-jawed, desperate-eyed females whose primary purpose early in life seems to be to engineer mating themselves (love doesn't even enter into the equation) to one of these obnoxious monied frat boys.  Really, with their assortment of silly Masonic-style Olde-Boy's Club rituals--most of which have a distinctly homosexual underpinning--these oh-so-white Americans look exactly like what they are: transplanted 17th-century Englishmen with all the class snobbery, racism, superiority, and pooftery symptomatic of the upper-eschelon Brit.  While this is essentially a soap-opera melodrama with very little action or story-driven impetus, there is nary a well-developed character to be found.  It's a bunch of miserable privileged white people taking three hours to demonstrate their misery...oh, and by the way they hold the Fate of all of us in their clammy whitebread hands.  Yikes.  There are two things that stuck out in this trudge of a movie for me.  One is the way Matt Damon's horn-rimmed-glasses/short haircut character physically put me in mind of Robert MacNamara--which is probably no accident.  The other is what I think is the most resonant line in the movie: when asked by Joe Pesci's aging Italian gangster--currently under threat of deportation by the US back to Italy--what it is that bloodless, cold, anonymous, WASPy types like Matt Damon's character have as a cultural group, Damon's Edward Wilson answers, with chilling lack of emotion, \\"We have America.  The restof you (meaning Jews, Blacks, Italians, etc) are just visiting.\\"  If you know any of these Long Island/Washington/Connecticut types personally, you also know that's pretty much exactly the way they feel.  If this tedious non-thriller of a movie gets something right, that attitude is it.
0515141429|4.0|Like many others I heard about Lee Child but never read any of his works.  I decided to start at the beginning of the series.  In retrospect this is an unbelievable story with too many coincidences to be believed.  It just goes to prove that if someone can tell a great story you stay riveted and turn the page. At the end you realize that this could not have happened and that Jack Reacher is a super hero.  He can beat up anyone and never needs to sleep.  I could not feel myself thinking of another superhero, Jack Bauer.   <br /> <br />All I can advise is to enjoy the story and escape from reality.  I will read the whole series but take a break in between each one.
B00007GZR5|3.0|This film is a \\"bigger picture\\" film; it is a pick-me-up to when the \\"turkeys got you down\\"!  I liken this film to Grand Canyon; stranger than fiction....The type of film that points out there is more to life than what you see...I prefer the alternate ending as to the film's ending.
B000LXH0AE|3.0|Loved the movie - hate the new Sony Copy Protection that won't even allow Sony DVD players to play it.  Nice..... Thanks, Sony
B000MV9026|5.0|I wasn't going to review this until I saw all these one-star \\"it's political propaganda telling us how awful humans are\\" stuff.  Does Rush Limbaugh write reviews here?<br /><br />Anybody seen Planet Earth on the Discovery channel?  Kind of related - the polar bear not being able to walk on the ice and hunt because it's melting is poignant and scary.  We live in a gorgeous world, and this movie was a lesson in how humans have changed it and affected animals in places we never even thought of, and it's on a level that kids can understand.  But it's uplifting, too, because it shows people working together to come up with solutions.  If ONLY you could get people to agree to protect habitats as easily as they did in this movie!!  It had an inspiring ending showing what's possible when we all work together for the good of our common world rather than being too short-sighted to think about what our actions will mean for our children and grandchildren, not to mention the other species on our planet.<br /><br />Yeah, humans were the villain at first, but in the end we were the heroes because we recognized the importance of protecting the world, came together, and did something about it, and everybody was happy.  That's pretty inspiring to me.<br /><br />Oh, and I did think it was weird that there were so many sexual references in a kids movie - but it seems like there are sexual references everywhere these days, and since I'm not a parent yet, I didn't really think about it.
B000J103X4|4.0|I admit, I was pretty amazed when I heard The Game's sophomore album \\"The Doctor's Advocate\\". When I heard that Dr. Dre wasn't going to be apart of this album, I wondered how is Game going to handle working with other producers. But he didn't let it affect him whatsoever, because he used it to his advantage. The Game has shown improvement since \\"The Documetary\\", and has gone through some drama between that album and this one. The fact that he was able to work with that and let it all out on this album was good.<br /><br />As I said before, Game has shown improvement as a rapper. Listening to tracks like \\"Ol' English\\" and \\"The Doctors Advocate\\", Game shows that he is able to handle himself on the lyrical side of things. I really wasn't feeling the lead single \\"It's Okay (One Blood)\\" (check out the remix), but the second single \\"Wouldn't Get Far\\" is dope and features Kanye West.<br /><br />Production on here is a lot better than \\"The Documentary\\". Since you know Dr. Dre isn't on here, Game enlists producers like Nottz for the bumping track \\"One Night\\". will.i.am, Dion, Scott Storch, and Just Blaze (I'll give his props in a minute), as well as others drop in and add some production for \\"The Doctor's Advocate\\".<br /><br />Guest appearances are great as well. I mentioned a few guests earlier in my review, but like the song \\"California Vacation\\" which features vocals from Snoop Dogg and Xzibit. The Dogg Pound (Daz & Kurupt) do a good job on \\"Bang\\". Jamie Foxx lays down some of his R&B vocals for \\"Around The World\\". And damn, did they save the best song for last on this album. The almost nine and a half minute song \\"Why You Hate The Game\\" just blew me away, especially with that beat by Just Blaze. Nas and Marsha Ambrosius from Floetry appear on that song, and I have to say that it was amazing, that I hit the replay button on my first listen (I rarely do that on ANY CD). In fact that song alone warrants a higher score than what I was planning on giving. It's THAT good.<br /><br />Although \\"The Doctor's Advocate\\" is nice, we still have some residue from the previous album. Of cource, The Game does his name dropping. I can't count how many times he mentioned Dr. Dre or \\"The Chronic\\" on this album. It doesn't affect this album as much as his first, probably because we've all gotten used to it. Also I wasn't feeling the songs \\"Compton\\" and \\"Lets Ride\\". Other than that this is one excellent album from The Game. He didn't let any distractions phaze him when he made this album. He also showed that he can carry an album without Dr. Dre's production (lets see if he can do it without Dre refrences). This is one album I can recommend to your library. The Game's sophomore album gets much props from me. If he drops more albums like this, there is no telling what he is capable of.<br /><br />Lyrics: A<br />Production: A+<br />Guest Appearances: A+<br />Musical Vibes: A+<br />Overall: A+<br /><br />Top 5 Favorite Tracks:<br />1.

B000MQC9H4|4.0|I watched this movie four times in the past week and a half - transatlantic flights where the choice was either this or CSI reruns.  Anyway, I'm a big fan of Kate Winslet and Jack Black, and remember making a mental note to myself that I'd like to see it when it was new, and it was good.  The script was fun, Jack Black was great, Kate Winslet was her usual fantastic self, Cameron Diaz was Cameron Diaz, only slightly better than usual, and the whole thing was light and fluff.  I didn't get the whole \\"moving, tear-jerking\\" thing that some other people seemed to have experienced.<br /><br />The one thing that kept messing with my brain is that the timings just don't seem to add up.  To start with the vacation was going to be for 2 weeks.  And that was before Christmas, right?  BUT, everyone was meant to  be going home by New Year's.  So did the two weeks start like on December 15?  If so, how does that work?  Why was Iris' work place having a holiday party and talking about working the next week with a short staff because of the holiday?  And the timings just never seemed to match up properly.  So, I don't know - I'm obviously a freak about that kind of thing and it bugs me when it doesn't make sense or add up.<br /><br />All in all it was fun and feel-good but it wasn't anything spectacular.  Glad I didn't see it in the theater, but glad I saw it.  And Jack Black was great.  Or did I already say that?
B000063DFQ|4.0|Every one who was into Metal when this came out played this into uselessness. Remember, this was before CD's existed. The band STILL plays 3 cuts off of this when they tour. Where Eagles Dare, Flight of Icarus, Die With Your Boots On and Trooper are all classics. This, along with Ozzy's \\"Diary Of A Madman\\" and Judas Priest's \\"Screaming For Vengeance\\" altered the musical landscape. It's an important piece of history.
B000HCO8IQ|4.0|Our favorite retro glam boys (and girl) are back, and they prove once again that they are one of the few good young bands in the mainstream pop genre these days.  I must confess to still liking album one a little better than this one, but Ta-Dah has moments that work so incredibly well that I can't give it less than four well-earned stars.<br /><br />As Miss Amanda said, I was completely blown away by the first cut (co-penned by Sir Elton as you've no doubt read here a million times already), and it reminded me something of old Leo Sayer disco hits, only better.  It's addictive and fun to work out to.<br /><br />\\"She's My Man\\" decidedly sounds quite a bit like Sir Elton's \\"All the Girls Love Alice\\" from Goodbye Yellow Brick Road and is a bit grittier while \\"Lights\\" is almost Frankie Vallie \\"Grease\\"-styled sophisti-pop.<br /><br />\\"Kiss You Off\\" features Ms. Ana Matronic and kicks some serious kiester, but my favorite songs on here have to be all the melodic and harmony driven novelty-styled ballads like \\"I Can't Decide,\\" \\"Intermission,\\" and \\"Might Tell You Tonight\\" because Jake Shears has such a clear, fluid, and pleasurable voice.  The lyrics to \\"I Can't Decide\\" never fail to get a chuckle out of yours truly while those of \\"Intermission\\" leave one thinking about their life in general.<br /><br />There's plenty of old-school disco influence throughout this disc for the glittery fun factor, but the band also shows a bit more of their pensive side this time around.  My favorite song on this album has to be the beautiful, ethereal, and somewhat sad \\"The Other Side.\\"  It really is one of the best songs the band has recorded so far, right along with \\"Laura\\" and \\"Take Your Mama.\\"<br /><br />All in all, if you loved the first SS, obtaining Ta-Dah is simply a must.  This group is intelligent, confidently and admirably pretentious, fu\\"nny, and truly talented.  I love them and, by all rights, so should you.
B00000JPYD|5.0|...and have some fun. This may be the finest example of British Blues guitar work ever done. There is not a weak element anywhere on this disc. The vocal, bass and drum work is all solid, but this is about Robin Trower on the guitar. Everybody talks about \\"Zep II\\", but I like this better. It's just too bad that Robin Trower never found this kind of magic on any of his other solo releases.
B000G759LW|4.0|You can tell how much Christina Aguilera has grown in regards to her style when it comes to this new release. The old school, jazz/soul type music Christina used for inspiration in Back to Basics is sexy, sultry, and very catchy, but it still is very modern in flavor. ...In my opinion, there are only two or three songs that really capture the 40's, 50's, and 60's flair. I really love this CD, though - fans of hers shouldn't be disappointed, though some newer ones may have trouble adjusting to her new, maturer sound.
B000MXPE7O|2.0|This movie was called, the Godfather of Spy movies and a thriller. I question both. First of all, the only thing it had in common with the Godfather is that three people got wacked, DeNiro was in it and it was really long at 2 hours and 47 minutes. Oh, and it has Joe Pesci in it too, who has been known to cohoot with the mobster types.<br /><br />Thriller? There was absolutely nothing thrilling about it. In fact, it was very slow and tedious. It starts off interesting, showing how Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) was recruited and indoctrinated into the world of spying and the elite secret group \\"the Skull & Bones\\". It also has an interesting Love story between Wilson, Clover (Angelina Jolie) & a shy deaf girl named Laura (Tammy Blanchard).<br /><br />The problem with the film is that it didn't need to be nearly 3 hours long. It really didn't. The movie had no elements of intrigue or hook. It was just a series of events that showed how the life of a spy slowly and systematically destroyed a good man.<br /><br />The film is well filmed and well acted, I'm not knocking these elements of the film. It was just boring.<br /><br />To make a long story short, which DeNiro (who directed the film) should have done, the movie could have been shortened dramatically. After about an hour and forty minutes of the film, I found myself hitting the fast forward button and fully understanding everything that was speeding past my eyes.<br /><br />There's nothing wrong with long movies, but you better have something that keeps your interest. Had I gone to see this at the movie theatre, I would have slept or left. Seriously.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|I found the DVD to be very entertaining with a lot of energy attributed to the first \\"Celtic Woman\\" performance. The staging, the music, and the Castle as the backdrop was fascinating.

B000KQGX1Y|4.0|The music was fantastic. It was just as good if not better than the \\"Celtic Woman\\" Cd. It was the better choice for me since the bonus tracks cover the remainder of the \\"A New Journey\\" DVD not on the standard cd.
B000002UAU|5.0|Although I prefer Rubber Soul (so pretty, delicate and intricate), Revolver (a lovely balance between the beautiful Soul and the eclectic Pepper), the White Album (such variety and so many great songs) and Abbey Road (side two is THE greatest side of music on any LP ever!) Sgt. Pepper is without peer as the most interesting and innovative Beatles album.<br /><br />After Revolver this 17 year old anxiously awaited the release of the next Beatles opus. From day one in 1963, with each succeeding record, the greatest band of all time progressed musically and lyrically. The last track of Revolver (Tomorrow Never Knows) gave us an inkling of where they were headed. However, this was, after all, The Beatles. No-one knew what to expect. Would they head, musically, east to India? Would they tread water for a while?<br /><br />June 2nd 1967 arrived and so, here in North America, did Sgt. Pepper. What struck us all as we stripped off the plastic was the cover. It is now the most famous in history. On the day of its release it was, to say the least, startling. However, we didn't buy the record for its wrapping. I am sure that the vast majority of buyers hesitated only briefly before placing the vinyl on the turntable. What awaited us was a musical ride that no-one could have foreseen in his wildest dreams.<br /><br />Anyone reading the reviews here on Amazon is probably already familiar with every nook and cranny of this record. I won't bore with a recital of the individual songs. Anyway, what struck me then, and strikes me today, is the breadth of the music as a whole. The album careens from style to style, one moment it is English music hall, another it is pure psychedelia, then it is a delicate and heart rending ballad. The closing Day in the Life represents possibly the zenith of The Beatles imaginative song-writing talents.<br /><br />As I now listen to this record for the umpteenth time I'm not so sure that I prefer those other albums to Pepper! Isn't that the genius of The Beatles? I know that as much as I love Wish You Were Here and Piper, Dark Side will always be my favourite Floyd. With the Beatles I suspect that my favourite of the five LPs in contention will always be the one to which I am listening at any particular moment.<br /><br />I remember that summer very clearly. Jimi burst forth. The Jefferson Airplane took off. We heard Pink Floyd for the first time. The Doors, The Who, The Monterey festival, A Whiter Shade of Pale - the list goes on. But above all of this towered Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. I appreciate that one generation will often suggest that it has seen the be all and end all in some particular aspect of sports or the arts. Then a generation or two later it is proved wrong. However, I doubt very much that we shall ever again see a popular piece of music so influential in both the long and the short term. On June 1st, 2007, in England, it will be \\"forty years ago today\\".  Pepper has stood the test of time. I have no doubt that in forty years someone else will write a review of this album and commence with \\"it was eighty years ago today and.......\\"the genius of The Beatles?

B000002KOY|4.0|I recently visited a website where one of the topics for discussion was \\"little known classics\\". There were some interesting choices from the several hundred who participated. A great many picked albums that were far-removed from the class of hidden gems. Zeppelin and Floyd appeared in some lists! Crazy Horse, on the other hand, defines the category.<br /><br />Any band that includes the great Danny Whitten along with Ralph Molina, Jack Nitzsche and Nils Lofgren had better be good. And they are. The record bounces from hard rocking (Downtown) to affecting country ballad (I Don't Want to Talk About it) to catchy pop (Carolay) to the Beatlesque I'll Get By (even sounds like a Beatle title, doesn't it?). There is nary a missed beat. I fondly remember  riding in my beat-up '67 Pontiac, my eight track player hanging out of the glove box, wires everywhere, windows down, volume blasting, singing along with this album. Soon thereafter the car went to the wrecker along with my player. My copy of Crazy Horse sat in a box in a series of basements until I tossed out all of my 8-tracks a couple of years ago. Then, a couple of weeks ago, I bought a couple of new Neil Young DVD/Cds featuring CH as the back up band. My memory was jogged. Thanks to Amazon I am now the proud owner of this excellent recording on cd. Let there be no doubt about it, on the basis of this record alone, Crazy Horse deserved to be a leading hit group of the early 70's. Oh well, the list of over-looked masterpieces is a long one. There is no shame in standing alongside such stellar efforts as:<br /><br />Fleetwood Mac - Mystery to me<br /><br />David Crosby - If I Could Only Remember my Name<br /><br />World Party- Take your pick of any release!<br /><br />Big Star - #1 Record<br /><br />Camper Van Beethoven - Key Lime Pie<br /><br />Thomas Dolby - The Flat Earth<br /><br />Peter Murphy - Deep<br /><br />Boz Scaggs - Boz Scaggs (with Loan me a Dime)<br /><br />Almost any Go-Betweens album.<br /><br />Lewis Taylor - The Lost Album
0316010669|5.0|Blink is a very well-written collection of studies, stories and observations that helps readers begin to understand the power of our unconscious minds.   <br /> <br />Every day we make thousands of unconscious judgments and decisions that shape our present and future lives, and affect our relationships -- both personal and professional.  The more insight we gain into our deeply-ingrained beliefs and impressions, and the more we learn to gauge and respond to our physiological cues (to which we are largely estranged as a culture), the better-equipped we will be to steer our lives in a direction that brings us true individual success, happiness and spiritual fufillment. <br /> <br />Some of the later chapters in the book lost me a bit (possibly just because it was about military matters that are a bit over my head), but overall, reading this book was well worth my time. <br /> <br />I highly recommend Blink to anyone who desires to better understand human nature and the power of the multi-faceted human brain.  This book reminds me why I was a Psychology major and, more importantly, reminds me how much there is to know and see and do in this life.  Immerse yourself and enjoy it. <br />
B000002UDB|4.0|After the ground-breaking and heady Sgt. Pepper any new release by The Beatles was destined to be critically and publicly less well received. The fact that two of the best cuts on the LP had been released as singles (the two-sided hit Penny Lane/ Strawberry Fields) well before the album debuted inevitably diminished the excitement that accompanied the first spinning of a new Beatles album. Finally, and predictably, the \\"controversy\\" surrounding the \\"failed\\" movie allowed the naysayers some room to air their opinion that the momentum achieved by the band over the course of the previous two years had finally stalled. I cannot really argue with any of the foregoing! That being said, Magical Mystery Tour remains a brilliant album choc-a-block with interesting trippy songs. There isn't a bad song to be found. Although I have played Pepper more often than I have this record in retrospect I can't honestly say that I prefer one to the other. This is an amended review. The re-mastered mono is spectacular - 5 stars
B00007K02F|4.0|\\"Jane Eyre\\" seems like a slightly odd choice for the great Franco Zeffirelli, but he turned out a slow if excellent adaptation, full of exquisite scenery and picturesque gothic flavour. But what really makes it brilliant is a virtuoso performance by William Hurt as the tortured hero, even if his costar lacks the necessary passion.<br /><br />Jane Eyre (Anna Paquin) was raised by a nasty aunt-by-marriage, and later taken to a cruel minister's boarding school for girls, where she was humiliated and treated badly. Years later, the grown Jane (Charlotte Gainsbourg) leaves the school behind, taking a job as a governess to a little French girl, at a remote Gothic castle owned by the brooding Mr. Rochester (Hurt).<br /><br />But there are mysteries at the castle -- mad laughter can be heard from the upstairs, and Rochester is tormented by difficulties that have made him \\"hard as an India-rubber ball.\\" Yet Jane still falls in love with her fiery, reclusive employer, and he falls in love with her strange, strong ways -- until the nastiest secret of his life comes out, and threatens to separate them forever.<br /><br />Somehow I never expected this classic gothic novel to be the sort of thing Zeffirelli would have done. But he does an excellent job bringing Charlotte Bronte's story to life, and giving it an unearthly beauty -- lots of misty countrysides, sunlit graveyards, and a looming castle up on a hill like a medieval fortress.<br /><br />It's rather slow-moving -- Jane's nasty childhood takes up a lot of time, for instance. But Zeffirelli builds up suspense and suppressed feeling, all of which climaxes in a literally burning finale -- a magnificently taut and terrifying scene. And he adapts Bronte's prose into intense, vivid dialogue (\\"Even she is better off here than she would be in a lunatic asylum, but I have spent the last fifteen years in TORMENT!\\").<br /><br />Gainsbourg has the required unearthly plainness that Jane Eyre needs, but she lacks the essential intensity and passion that the character possesses. During the movie's most intense scenes, when Rochester's secret is revealed, she doesn't even blink -- she just stands and stares. A young Anna Paquin has a lot more hidden fire early on.<br /><br />But William Hurt is simply stellar as Rochester -- he's not young or handsome, but he has the dark, sardonic, embittered, sorrowful thing down to an art. He's especially great in the final lap, where he plays Rochester with all his bitter anger and love unleashed, and Rochester after a fire ravages his home. The final scenes are absolutely exquisite.<br /><br />The movie suffers from some lackluster acting at time, but Hurt's performance and Zeffirelli's direction make \\"Jane Eyre\\" an excellent, watchable adaptation. Definitely a good watch.ential intensity and passion that the character possesses.

0792165020|3.0|The entire time that I watched this movie, I felt as if I was missing something, that there was something I wasn't cluing in on.  I rented \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\" without the slightest clue about what the story entailed.<br /><br />Matt Damon portrays the mysterious Mr. Ripley, who, more or less, remains a mystery throughout the film. I was intrigued at how, when you first see him on screen, you are given the impression that he is nothing more than a shy, innocent, and intellectual young man who pretty much keeps to himself. However, this image is only visable for the first five minutes or so, and is virtually shattered once he accepts the offer to go to Italy in search of Mr. Greenleaf's son, Dickie. I was fascinated at how rapidly his personality altered, and suddenly I understood that he was rather odd, as he deceived Mr. Greenleaf in the first place by wearing a Princeton jacket and pretending that he knew Dickie.<br /><br />As the film progresses and it becomes more apparent there is something deeply wrong with Damon, you almost begin to root for him to get away with his malicious acts. He is so effective as the quietly psychotic Ripley because his actions do not seem planned. He just kind of takes what is not his without reason.<br /><br />The beauty of Rome, Venice, and Gwyneth Paltrow tends to hide the inner turmoil going on with Damon's character and Jude Law is oblivious to it most of the time. The madness builds slowly and Law, as the target of Damon's consuming desire, realizes it too late. Law has the looks and mannerisms of a 50's matinee idol which fits perfectly within the context of the film.<br /><br />Some people have said The Talented Mr. Ripley is like a Hitchcock film for the 90's. I would have to agree. Damon's ability to portray a fully realized, human leach is amazing at times and the fact that I actually had some sympathy for him proves it. There are scenes of utter shock and dismay, but it is the drowning build to the inevitable murder and mayhem that grabs you.rabs you.
B000002KXV|5.0|Ok, let me just start by saying-wow! I don't care who you are or what kind of music you're into, you need to check this CD out. <br />  I didn't think it could get any better than the wonderful sound of Steely Dan, but when Donald Fagen set out to create his first solo album released in 1982, I was proven wrong. This compilation of 8 cool Fagen beats is irresistable, and what a great image for an album look-late night DJ playing these jazzy bits all night long, aka \\"The Nightfly\\". I guess Fagen himself summed it up best, \\"The songs on this album represent certain fantasies that might have been entertained by a young man growing up in the remote suburbs of a Northeastern city during the late 50's and early 60's, I. E., one of my general height, weight and build.\\" <br />  This masterpiece begins with \\"I.G.Y.\\"(International Geophysical Year). Of all the songs I've ever heard, this one's got one of the coolest, jazziest tunes, with key synthesizers and upbeat lyrics. This song's got such a jaunty little tune, you almost don't need the lyrics, but of course they're great. Definitely my favorite track. <br />  The tempo picks up slightly with \\"Green Flower Street\\", and then drops down for jazzy interludes of \\"Ruby Baby\\" and \\"Maxine\\". \\"New Frontier\\" is fast paced, setting the tone for flagship, \\"The Nightfly\\". Here Fagen entertains the fantasy of an independent radio station, late night 'WJAZ, with jazz and conversation.' \\"The Goodbye Look\\" is a close second favorite of mine vying for attention with xylophones straight out of Havana, and another archanic story brought to you by Fagen's keen ability to write intriguing lyrics. The Nightfly is wrapped up with upbeat \\"Walk Between Raindrops\\" who's 1950's makeup is uncharacteristic of Fagen but great fun. <br />  All in all, this is a CD which just can't be passed up. It only contains 8 tracks, but these are so good that you don't need more. And don't be fooled by this album's debut year either, its way before it's time and simply one of the best albums I've ever heard. It needs to be checked out!
B00000K0DQ|4.0|\\"Dead Man Walking\\" deals with one nun's struggle to help a convicted death row inmate come to terms with his imminent execution. Writer-director Tim Robbins does something very difficult in this film, he makes us care about the unsympathetic character that Penn plays. Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn dominate the film in every aspect imaginable, they play a complicated chess match at times and eventually become close friends by the end of the picture. The fact that Sarandon and Robbins are openly against the death penalty in real life just adds to this film. Their strong opinion on the subject leads to an unforgettable motion picture that is made well and performed well by the two leads.  Of course, no film is 100% unbiased, especially when it comes to such serious issues as these, but I liked it. Features one of the most chilling and realistic scenes of an execution ever to be captured on celluloid. Based on the book by Helen Prejean (the real-life nun, who appears briefly outside the prison during a candlelight vigil scene).

B000KX0IOK|4.0|I check out \\"Half Nelson\\" because Ryan Gosling received an Oscar nomination for his performance, but when I sat down to actually watch the film I knew nothing else about the film (I was going to say that I did not remember the clip they showed of him at the Academy Awards when they did the Best Actor nominees, but suddenly I cannot remember if they even bother to do that anymore). So, while watching the movie by initial question was \\"What is this movie about?\\" That becomes a pivotal question because until the final scene, I could not really answer it because \\"Half Nelson\\" is a film that seems like it is going to be about several things other than what it ends up being about. At the end I was surprised, and pleasantly so, to find what I thought was the point.<br /><br />Gosling plays Dan Dunne, who is teaching history to eighth graders and coaching girls basketball in a Brooklyn junior high school. Each spring I watch Ken Burns' \\"Baseball\\" and when they get to the Dodgers leaving for Los Angeles in the late 1950s one of the points made was that the borough of Brooklyn had been transformed into a predominantly black community. So Dan's students are black and Hispanic. Then one of Dan's 13-year-old students, Drey (Shareeka Epps), catches him doing drugs after school one day after basketball practice. The rest of their film is basically about the relationship been Dan and Drey, with the exact nature of that relationship being open to interpretation, mainly because we cannot help but anticipate myriad ways in which this could all end badly. Drey's mother is an overworked single mother, which means that Drey has had to grow up pretty much on her own, which explains in part her attitude towards the world in general and Dan in particular.<br /><br />I have been teaching over half my life now and I watched this 2006 film from that occupational psychosis (as Kenneth Burke would label it), even though I cannot really say that director Ryan Fleck and his partner Anna Boden are making a movie that is primarily about teaching. Dan is a teacher and Drey is his student, but most of what is significant about their lives and their relationship clearly happens outside of the classroom. The chicken or the egg quandary here is which came first, Dan's drug habit or his failings as a teacher. To be fair, it is not that there is obvious evidence of Dan's failure in the classroom, even though the principal is on his case about his refusal to stick to the curriculum, especially telling when it is on a unit about the Civil Rights movement. His students seem enthralled by his insistence on the importance of understanding the dialectics of history, but we never get a sense that this is having an actual impact on their lives or at least their appreciation of history. They are bits where the students recite about some choice bit of American history, but one time a student immediately looks off camera and wonders if what they just said was really true, which might be just a joke, but it also undercuts the idea of Dan's effectiveness in the classroom. Of course I am eager to add to the problem because I keep coming up with ways that Dan can get his students truly excited about the oppositional forces he cares so much about.<br /><br />The third most important character in the film turns out to be Frank (Anthony Mackie), a neighborhood drug dealer with whom Dan has done business. Frank is related to Drey's family, so when Dan objects to Frank getting friendly with Drey and wants to rescue her, it creates a nexus of (you guessed it) oppositional forces. It also brings things to a head and what I really like about this movie is that it resolves both the conflict between Dan and Frank, as well as the relationship between Dan and Drey, in ways that I did not anticipate. I would say that the problem with \\"Half Nelson\\" is that it spends a lot of time skating close to assorted melodramatic plot lines while charting its own course. This is a movie that I think you will enjoy more the second time around when you can stop being distracted by what the film is not about to enjoy how it does set up its true thesis. You can still appreciate the performance by Gosling, doing a decidedly different take on a drug addict, but you will also applaud how Epps more than holds her own in their scenes together.k you will enjoy more the second time around when you can stop being distracted by what the film is not about to enjoy how it does set up its true thesis.

In spite of it being the final show of another long worldwide trek, you can tell they really enjoy what they do.

B0001HAISG|5.0|My six year old son and I are writing our first movie review together.  We were both so impressed with this movie that we felt we had to let the rest of the world know how fantastic it was.  First my son's review: \\"I would like to buy it because it is cool and exciting and adventurous.  I do not want to return it to the library.  I want to watch it 6,100 more times.  My favorite part was at the end when Peter and Hook were fighting.\\"  From an adult perspective this movie was visually stunning and well written and acted.  When it is so hard to find a movie that the whole family cannot only watch, but enjoy, this movie completely surprised and delighted me.  I hadn't heard of this version before, my kids were too young when it first came out I guess. I checked reviews after watching and found it didn't go over well with some critics.  I think you have to have a part of your inner child still alive and kicking to really get this much darker, realistic, film as compared to the Disney version.  Overall it was a far more rewarding movie in my opinion (and my son enjoyed it more too).  I think my son will win and we will order this movie on DVD to enjoy many more times.
B00012QM8G|5.0|<br />SCHINDLER'S LIST (1993, Universal) is Steven Spielberg's masterpiece and one of the most important motion pictures of all time.  Gorgeously crafted in every area and flawlessly acted, it won seven Oscars and got several more nominations for its distinguished cast.  (It also won Best Picture from seemingly every film critic group in the country.)  But this unforgettable true story of the Holocaust deserves more than Academy Awards; it deserves a Nobel Peace Prize for director/co-producer Spielberg. <br /> <br />How on earth did such an incomparable work of art and shattering drama get made in mainstream corporate Hollywood?  A 196 minute B&W downer with no big star names in its cast?  Maybe God willed it to be made--and made by a Jewish filmmaker with enormous power in Hollywood.  It tells the true story of Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a womanizing and chain smoking Nazi and a self-centered war profiteer who saved some 1,100 Jews from death at Auschwitz and other concentration camps during World War Two.  Ralph Fiennes, a thousand miles away from QUIZ SHOW and THE ENGLISH PATIENT, is a chilling death camp commandant who gets his kicks shooting Jews point blank at random.  And Ben Kingsley is amazing as Schindler's quiet Jewish bookkeeper, Itzhak Stern; I can't  believe this is the same actor who played Gandhi and Meyer Lansky in BUGSY.  It is beyond versatility. <br /> <br />The source here is Thomas Keneally's novel, inspired by fact and adapted by Oscar winner Steven Zaillian.  Schindler has a munitions factory in Poland.  He saves hundreds of Jews from nearby Auschwitz (chilling location filming makes an indelible difference) by telling Nazi leaders that he needs the Jews to work in his factory making elegant items the Nazis can use and sell.  The movie has a genius conceit--a Nazi cheating the Nazis and saving countless Jews who really mean nothing to him.  What makes him do it, perhaps risking his own life in the process?  Neeson makes Schindler a fascinating and compelling enigma. <br /> <br />SCHINDLER'S LIST is a very long movie and a very difficult one to watch at times with its Holocaust violence.  It runs three hours and 16 minutes, and Oscar-winning editor Michael Kahn gives it all an engrossing and smooth pacing.  It may even improve in intimacy on home video at night, with the viewer stretched out on a bed with a bottle of water and the answer machine taking phone calls.  But my own Christian parents and a lot of Jewish (and Christian) friends have never been able to watch the movie.  They don't feel up to it, and in a way I can't blame them.  You can never again view the Holocaust in the same way after seeing this film, especially the scenes actually filmed at Auschwitz and in Krakow sewers with kids hiding. <br /> <br />The film's look, by Oscar winner Janusz Kaminski, is exquisite--like no other B&W movie I have ever seen, except maybe a German Fassbinder movie.  It has velvet blacks and creamy whites and shadows in the scenes with the Nazis, and  bleached-out white skies and fog in the death camps.  I may never forget the scene where nude women are inside the packed Auschwitz \\"showers\\", knowing they are about to be gassed--and instead really get streams of water.  Are the rumors about the camps not true?  The women, walking back to crowded barracks with robes on, look back and see smoke rising from night shower chimneys, mixed with fog in Kaminski's matchless use of black and white; the rumors are true and the women just got lucky that night. <br /> <br />In a film that is 95% high gloss B&W, the opening shot (with two candles on a dining table) and closing scene in modern Israel (with the surviving Schindler Jews putting stones on Oskar Schindler's grave) are in color.  But in the middle of the movie, watch Schindler on horseback on a hilltop watching a little girl walking in a hand-colored red coat through an otherwise B&W town.  She will meet an unforgettably horrible fate, seemingly in the ovens.But Spielberg doesn't feel up to shooting such a scene (who can blame him?) and instead just shows the red coat on a pile of Jewish clothes later in the film. <br /> <br />SCHINDLER'S LIST is a movie masterpiece that has an devastating and indelible effect on a discriminating adult audience.  As the war ends, Schindler has to ironically go into hiding and bemoans the fact that he did not save more Jews.  You want to cry at the end, even with a tempered happy ending, for the six million human beings killed by the Nazis.  This truly great film is dedicated to their memory.  This is a dark and profound and very troubling movie, but do try to watch it in honor of the war dead, especially for Holocaust Awareness Day on April 15th.  Spielberg's movie should be shown in college history courses more than in movie theaters.  Who wants to watch this film in a suburban multiplex with a talky audience munching loudly on candy bars and slurping Cokes? <br />Fortunately, it probably won't play in any multiplexes anymore fourteen years after its initial release. <br /> <br />Home video seems ideal for SCHINDLER'S LIST because you maybe have a three-and-a-half hour time slot on a weekend evening, the movie all to yourself, a phone maybe unplugged, and a DVD/VCR pause button for bathroom and food breaks.  Treat this monumental film with that much respect.  The movie places Steven Spielberg in a pantheon for filmmakers who have made incomparable motion pictures that make a difference in the way we view world history in the 20th Century.  There can be no higher praise from me as a film scholar. <br /> <br />    <br />
B000MXPE7O|4.0|I really enjoyed The Good Shepherd.  I went into the film expecting a slow paced historical restrospective of the movie.  Althought that is what I received, for the most part, the difficult aspect of the movie was the feeling that the fine actors were aloof.  I had trouble connecting with some of the characters, especially the main leads.  Matt Damon did an excellent job, and I imagine he was directed in such a way as to seem a bit ambiguous.  Jolie's character could have been much richer; however, I think the complicated plot took such a long time to tell, that character development took a backseat.  To put this movie in terms of a novel, this would be a LeCarre vs. a Ludlum.  Do not go into this movie expecting a thrill a minute ala a Ludlum novel, rather expect a meandering complicated story ala LeCarre's Absolute friends.<br /><br />I have noted some very well-written reviews regarding this movie.  I agree with several of the reviewers.  However, I would argue with anyone who lables this a bad or terrible movie.  It is certainly not in my opinion.  This is a solid four star movie that falls short of a higher rating due to the inaccessibility of the characters.
B000MCH5P4|1.0|Where to begin in describing Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's latest multinarrative film, except to describe it as a self-involved, boring waste of time? \\"Babel\\" interweaves the story of a purely innocent American family (parents played by Brad Pitt and Kate Blanchett) who are basically the victims of bad decisions made by people from Japan, Mexico, and Morocco. As the movie unfolds, a young Moroccan boy accidentally shoots an American woman while she sleeps on a tourist bus during a vacation. Meanwhile, the shooting victim's Mexican housekeeper takes her two children illegally from the United States to Mexico to attend a wedding, and later gets busted while trying to return to San Diego. Then, there's a Japanese family somehow involved. As it turns out, the father in the Japanese family had given the rifle to a Moroccan hunter guide, who then sold it to a man whose kids end up shooting the American woman. The American family is purely innocent in this entire escapade, and are completely victimized by the stupid decisions made by people from foreign countries. Is the lesson for Americans to avoid travel abroad? To avoid hiring Mexican day laborers? To avoid anything involving the Japanese?
B00005B36H|5.0|I have always loved every song I had ever heard from Tool, so I decided to buy their cd recently. This CD is possibly one of the best CDs I have ever heard. If you like Tool at all, then you'll love this CD.
B000003TA4|4.0|&lt;takes a deep breath> Reason for the nervousness is that Nirvana, like the Beatles, is one of those bands that you almost can't even criticize. It's like you're born fans whether you want to or not and saying otherwise will bring about a cavalcade of angry Nirvana fans telling you \\"you don't know music, Nirvana was the greatest!\\". And I will admit, at one point I was a massive fan (and let's face it, everyone in the early 90's was so you must as well act accordingly and be one too). To that note, this is probably the best Nirvana record; not because it's the most popular but on a song-by-song basis, it's the strongest. <br /> <br />Smells Like Teen Spirit: If you hate that so-called grunge acts and alt rock groups of the 90's, blame it on this song. A dynamic opening track where everything just feels in its right place. Of course the thing's been overplayed beyond any song should have but still, quite the song. 10/10 <br /> <br />In Bloom: Despite the fact it's a well-known song from the album, I just never cared for it. I don't know why, the chorus is a big sing-along, the lyrics, as usual, are abstract and the guitar riff is there but for some reason I just never cared for it that much. 7/10 <br /> <br />Come as You Are: Literally the very first guitar riff I learned on guitar and thankfully it's attached to a good song. From it's memorable \\"memoria\\" pre-chorus to the drum beat giving the song a big dynamic, it's one of the better crafted songs on here. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />Breed: Good god I hate this song. Unlike In Bloom which I can tolerate if I heard it, for some reason I just skip this. The song is super energetic and fast-paced but I just never got into it. I do like the opening riff though. 7/10 <br /> <br />Lithium: One of the big hits and rightfully so. From it's low sounding guitar chords to probably the catchiest chorus on the record, it's easy to see why it became a hit. My one complaint? I never liked the \\"I like you I'm not gonna cry\\" section at all. Not 16 years ago and still not now...wow, 16 years. 8/10 <br /> <br />Polly: This song's so kitschy it's kinda funny. A weird sounding guitar, a song about a bird (although actually about a girl who escaped being tortured and imprisoned), the song to me just screams \\"odd\\". Of course it's a likeable ditty so all's forgiven. 8/10 <br /> <br />Territorial P*ssings: Not a big fan of this either. This is where the record kind of loses steam in a way. Big screaming vocals, a song with literally 2 riffs (the bridge riff is the most effective) but all that screaming gets grating. 7/10 <br /> <br />Drain You: Originally I didn't like this song. There wasn't enough to grab me but then the \\"drai-ain you\\" melody got stuck in my head then the song kind of got better. Some people will get hooked right away, others might take awhile. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />Lounge Act: One of the most underrated songs on this whole thing. From the vocal melody, the chords, then of course when Kurt screams part of the verse, it's one of those album songs album owners will probably gravitate to. 9/10 <br /> <br />Stay Away: I don't like this one either. There's not really much to grab onto. Some songs repeat certain things in order to make it stick in your mind easier but this just didn't do it. Some like it but I don't. 7/10 <br /> <br />On a Plain: It's funny, I like the version on Unplugged in New York better than this one but the basic core is a solid one. Melodies and guitar riffs are spot-on and while it may take awhile to properly sink in, it never becomes bothersome. 8/10 <br /> <br />Something in the Way: Another underrated song. Melancholy guitar and Kurt's voice almost sounding robotish in its tone, it's quite a somber song. If I can even remotely find a complaint is the chorus sometimes repeats too much. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />That's my non fanboy-ish/non Nirvana-hater review which is a good place to be in. You don't think everything they touch is good or think they were an overrated band with an abstract and vague lyricist having his \\"lyrics\\" called poetic, it's simply a fine record that for the most part, hits the nail on the head.
0140187537|5.0|In \\"The Winter of Our Discontent\\", Steinbeck has us step into the shoes of an individual that I would guess is of a pretty rare breed: someone whose immediate ancestors had wealth, significance, & pedigree but all of which was recently lost, reducing this person to scratching out a living paycheck to paycheck.  Ethan Hawley spends a lot of time deliberating on the greatness of his heritage and its contrast with his current situation as a grocery store clerk barely making ends meet for his wife and two children.  In the course of the novel, Hawley devises a way to augment his finances even though by so doing he must justify a breach of his high moral standards.  But as we learn, there's a price for everything...<br /><br />This is a really well written book that reads quickly.  It has a more profound impact than its length of under 300 pages would indicate.  I read this a couple months ago and the details are already fading, but certain scenes will remain with me I'm sure.  The sad ending of course.  The no-nonsense banker / businessman Mr. Baker discovering Ethan's plan.  Ethan's last meeting with his drunkard old friend Danny.  Ethan's foiled bank heist.  A few others.<br /><br />In truth I'd give this 4.5 stars, if only because Ethan himself is a pretty annoying character since one can never tell if he's joking or serious.  Everything else, very well done.  Highly recommended.  This is a serious book for adults, not light reading for kids or teens.
0780631684|3.0|Like music \\"scenes\\"; from hair metal to grunge to nu-metal to garage rock, films as well have their eras. 80's masked killers slashers (Halloween) to the 90's teen slashers (Scream) to the Japanese remakes (The Ring) to the current era which is the uber-gory films (Hostel). Final Destination plays with the teen slasher conventions a little bit (before they fell into the uber-gory camp with the sequels) but ultimately it still fits and despite some problematic script issues, it's still an effective horror film at times.  <br /> <br />Alex Browning is a kid in a French class boarding Flight 180 en route to Paris. Just after takeoff, the plane's side rips off and it explodes. Of course it wasn't real as Alex just had a premonition and his erratic behavior and rantings of planes exploding is met with hostility from 5 of his classmates, his teacher and the staff and they're forced off the plane. Imagine everyone's shock when the plane actually indeed explodes in mid-air. But Death is mad as the all-powerful beings grand scheme of when people die was disrupted so he's hunting them one by one. <br /> <br />Main issue with the script is that the premise is intriguing but let's face it: it's still an oddball concept. Why would Death have flaws in its plan, even if we could see the signs? You'd think someone who has such a foresight and knowledge of fate wouldn't have things mess up easily. Alex almost becomes a gifted crime fighter with his know-how on how to beat death but it's a horror movie and it never makes sense. Plus he catches on incredibly quick to the idea that Death is playing hitman now that it seems kinda laughable he figured it out at all. <br /> <br />In a way, Final Destination reminds me of the first 2 Jurassic Parks while its sequels are like the third Jurassic installment: there's a sense of seriousness with this one and the Spielberg films whereas part 2 and 3 basically made it a thrill-ride and the gore almost becomes the reason to see it whereas this film was based on atmosphere and it does have a sense of foreboding. Now the very environment is threatening and anything can bring about someone's doom instead of a dude in a hockey mask. <br /> <br />Is it enjoyable? Sure. It's maybe not a great film through and through but as a horror film, it does its job well.
0143034901|5.0|\\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" is one of those rare books that entice readers to face their existential fears with the power of human dignity. Rather than describe the content of the story as other reviewers have so aptly done, I want to focus on the psychological fabric that Carlos Ruiz Saf&oacute;n weaves for us. As a clinical psychologist and author of a psychological novel, I can arguably state that Saf&oacute;n is one of the most gifted wordsmiths of this decade. And I dare say that, if he continues to develop his craft, he could inheret the best of Dumas and Proust for the twenty-first century.<br />Through his cast of characters, Saf&oacute;n explores the depth of evil, the bitter-sweetness of our first unrequited love, and the invincibility of the human spirit when confronted with darkness. Rather than feeling pity for the emotional and physical traumas that his characters endure, Saf&oacute;n exalts them to serve as examples of how honor overwhelms shame, and how forgiveness subdues bitter rage.<br />Saf&oacute;n's book exceeded my expectations and inspired me to become a better writer.
B000N6TX1I|4.0|Although Children of Men is not entirely successful truthfully, either in terms of being a self-contained film narrative or in terms of insightfully addressing the larger social-political issues it is after, I wholeheartedly endorse seeing it for several reasons.      One reason is that the vision of the future it offers is always interesting and often quite compelling, even if it sometimes feels not entirely well thought out when you begin to dissect things underneath the incredibly rich detail.  The spectre of our current situation hangs over this film bleakly and the filmmakers clearly intend us to respond and compare this future dystopian world with the conflicts we find ourselves fighting right now.  Too few films make an effort to try to comment on big controversial issues of today on this scale, so this movie scores more points for me on that front.  Now, some people will probably see the parallelism, unsubtle as it is, as an attack on their point of view and probably resent the political subtext, but I think the movie is relatively fair in raising its issues actually and spreads its condemnation around to multiple sides, advocating for basic and relatively uncontroversial humanistic values at heart.  Leaving the specific immigration issues to the side, the childless future is pretty much a general metaphor for a world where innocence and optimism is being wiped out in favor of endless conflict and division, and who, really, could argue with that being a problem, whatever your individual take on what we need to do as a society from here.  Unfortunately, because the film moves quickly from location to location and situation to situation, many of the characters, good and bad, don't have much time to develop and remain rather thin stock figures.  The actors are generally quite good but, again, some don't have quite enough to work with to create multi-dimensional personas that might transcend their shortlived functional roles in the script. Clive Owen, who is onscreen for most of the film, really does a fantastic job holding the whole thing together.    But the main reason to see this is that this film contains some of the most jaw-dropping displays of camera work and staging you can find out there.  Cuaron has gone after a very realistic feel and so a number of scenes are shot with a minimum of CG and you get truly sucked into the suspense the way only reality really gets to you.  Fans of the art of the long take in cinema, you absolutely must see this movie immediately, as it has three or four truly remarkable lengthy takes which are startling in their complexity.  I had to immediately rewatch the sequence in the car twice after finishing this film, it is so astonishing and hard to fathom on first view.  As a technical achievement in filmmaking, it's hard to think of a more impressive film in the last year.
0340822783|3.0|It seems like all a book or movie has to do in order to be cool is to chop up the linear timeline and reassemble it.  Sometimes, yes it has a purpose, (like that movie \\"Memento\\")  but maybe sometimes it's an excuse for an author who obviously has no problem at all coming up with great prose to make a messy desk look chic.   <br /> <br />Great ideas, good science fiction.   What's up with the comet birthmark?
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Top Twelve Reasons \\"North and South\\" is a ten:<br /><br />PRODUCTION VALUES: Historic looms weave again. Lemon-yellow sunlight floods a garden's translucent petals and leaves. Made me cry. Gave me chills.<br /><br />MARTIN PHIPPS' HYPNOTIC SCORE: reminiscent of Gorecki; minimalism that drills past the kapital-K-krap of the last hundred years of pop culture and reaches something as fundamental as the beat of a human heart, the lungs' breath. Honors both one of the most wrenchingly intimate onscreen moments ever and yet also the sweep of the Industrial Revolution.<br /><br />SINEAD CUSACK: breathtaking as a ruthless matriarch; better, even than Nancy Marchand as a Mafia queen in \\"The Sopranos.\\"<br /><br />POSTURE: Never has so much drama been milked out of actors' vertebrae. Helen Hayes' czarina pose in \\"Anastasia\\" was good, but Sinead Cusack's carriage and Richard Armitage's spinal column earn special Academy Awards.<br /><br />PLOT TWISTS: I did not know where this one was going until the very last moment of the very last scene. Twists pulled me into the issues the plot engages, and made me engage them myself.<br /><br />IT'S COMPLICATED: Leftist academics' pinko-tinged glasses depict the workers as beautiful and bosses as diabolical. But tycoon Andrew Carnegie, who brutalized his workers, was an epic philanthropist; workers scabbed, drank, and beat their kids. N&S depicts historical complications with its heroic/brutal workers/bosses. All characters are sometimes sympathetic, and sometimes utterly alienating -  just like real life! A complex script works to earn our understanding, and our love, for complex human beings, the service, art, at its best, performs.<br /><br />CHICK FLICK: \\"Fight, flight, or fix it\\" is a male response. Guy flix: explosions, chases, gadgets. \\"Tend and befriend\\" is a female response. We restore the world by ministering to its root: human hearts. N&S presents its heroine and its viewer with misunderstandings she must address; doing so, she matures, and we mature with her. Margaret's blossoming is an integral cog in a shock striking the world even today: the journey from tradition and pastoral beauty to sharp-elbow competition and industrial ugliness. Margaret's flailing culture shock and attempts to find, remain, and cultivate her best self under a rulebook she hasn't yet seen mirrors millions' struggle. Daniela Denby-Ashe limn's Margaret's triumph with honesty and grace. She's not afraid to be unlikeable; she's not even afraid to be noble.<br /><br />MISOGYNY-FREE ZONE: We are so awash in misogyny, often fed by women themselves -  who can forget the blow struck for women's dignity by celebrities who go out without their underthings? -  that N&S is almost shocking in the respect it shows women. Margaret Hale has a front-row seat to one of the greatest upheavals in human history: industrialization. She takes on its rewards and woes. She makes decisions, engages with the powerful, grows and changes. And she does all this without once trivializing herself, or allowing anyone else to trivialize her. *And* she's accompanied by interesting women and girls, both rich and poor. That, alone, makes N&S worth more than a hundred critical darlings in which misogyny is an inescapable ingredient.<br /><br />MORALITY. CHRISTIANITY. HOPE. REMEMBER THOSE? Gaskell's book and this adaptation take on really hard challenges: workers v. capitalists, traditional rural life's poverty and its beauty v. laissez-faire capitalism's new opportunities, ugliness and anomie. N&S could have just exploited the Industrial Revolution as colorful backdrop; it didn't. N&S attempts to offer solutions and hope, based on fundamental Christian values like non-violence and sharing. Gee, what if the folks who had made the nihilistic downer film \\"Syriana,\\" about our dependence on petroleum, had tried something similar? When the N&S boss and his workers sat down to a meal together, I cried cynicism-free tears. But . . . what WERE they eating? Itlooked like sludge. The redemption in the movie's key kiss is not just about eros, it's also about agape. And that made me cry. (Cried many times.)<br /><br />BRENDAN COYLE AS NICHOLAS HIGGINS: Let's import Higgins, making sure he keeps that snazzy, puffy-sleeved shirt that displays his chest hair. He'd be a greater boost to the trade union movement than locating Jimmy Hoffa.<br /><br />NOT A SINGLE WASTED CHARACTER, PERFORMANCE, OR SCENE: A bereaved husband converses with his late wife, as a maid looks on, her facial expression speaking volumes. A desperate man gazes at running water dyed purple. The most amazing scene of all, every bit as stunning as the famous crane shot in GWTW: a woman, her straw hat and bumpkin gait rendering her an agrarian silhouette in an industrial landscape, drawn by a seductive, menacing, thrum, walks up to a large wooden door, pulls it back, and steps into the Industrial Revolution. \\"I have seen hell, and it is white, snow white.\\" Mebbe so. But that scene is cinematic heaven-on-earth.<br /><br />RICHARD ARMITAGE: I don't even want to go there. Let's just say that I've just purchased the latest ticket to his crowded harem of adoring fans, and this: even if I had watched N&S with the sound turned off; Armitage's performance was so exquisitely articulate I could have transcribed pages of dialogue and backstory just from studying his face. But if I watched with the sound turned off, I would have missed the most arresting screen voice since Orson Welles, and the dreamiest since Ronald Coleman . . . Ladies, cave.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|I was not surprised by this DVD at all!  Our world is slowly dying, like a cancer unless we help to do something about it.  I am an advocate because I could see the change just in my own life (of 46 years). I can remember summers at our house at the Jersey shore!  Many fun-filled summers where the air was cool, through the day and at night.  We never once needed to turn on an air conditioner.  In the past 10 years, we began to notice it was warm at night, we were unable to get air into the house nor was it good sleeping weather.  In the past 5 years, we purchased air conditioners (window units).  We felt cramped in, claustrophobic.  No more was there that wonderful breeze for a chat on the porch or a walk on the beach.  We also noticed there are no more gullys that used to form on the beach surf that formed during the middle of the day and where we used to dig for huge clams!  I have noticed all of this and attribute it to global warming.  I want to do something now and I am!  You should, too!
B000I5YCCO|5.0|Taylor Swift is amazing! Every single song on this CD tells a story in which you can relate to.  Taylor is now my favorite singer because of her new CD!

B000022TSH|5.0|You're going to spend the majority of this movie wondering why it has the title it does and I'm not going to spoil it for you by mentioning it, but what I will say is that it has one of the great surprise endings in the history of Hollywood. The plot is outstanding and it's hard to tell where its going based on the first hour alone. Nicholson is superlative in the role of J.J. Gittes. His performance is nearly as good as Bogart's was in The Maltese Falcon. Dunaway and Houston are outstanding as well. Chinatown is every bit as entertaining as it is excellent.
B000002U82|5.0|Although I don't agree with those who say that this is the best album ever made, I do agree that it is a classic, essential five-star album.  It is rather more intellectual than emotional, it is very trippy, it blends blues/jazz with rock quite well, and, above all, it was produced with excellence.  The sound effects lead into the melodies successfully and significantly, and the album as a whole has a soothing, peaceful effect on me.  My favorite track is \\"Brain Damage\\", which actually I find a little unsettling, but perversely enjoyable.

B000J103PC|4.0|This is the film adaptation of a best selling novel of the same name by Lauren Weisberg. My daughter, who loved the book, was home visiting and suggested that we rent the film. We did so and really enjoyed it. The film is a tightly scripted, well-directed one with excellent performances.<br /><br />The story turns around an aspiring journalist, Andrea Sachs (Anne Hathaway) who lives with her hunky boyfriend, Nate (Adrien Grenier), an aspiring chef. Having just graduated from college, Andrea is looking for a job and improbably gets one working for a top notch fashion magazine. Her job is to be second assistant to the Editor-in Chief herself, Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), a veritable dragon lady before whom everyone kowtows. It is a job for which many would give their eyeteeth to have. Andrea, however, sees it just as a way station stop to becoming a legitimate journalist, as she is not at all interested in fashion, as evidence by the way she dresses.  Meanwhile, for Emily (Emily Blunt), the catty and acerbic newly promoted first assistant that lives in fear of Miranda Priestly, her job is her life.<br /><br />Thrust into the fashion maelstrom and thought of  as a size six fatty by all the size zeros with which she works, Andrea begins to change as the perks that go along with working for such a powerhouse fashion rag become apparent. The magazine's stylist (Stanley Tucci) ultimately helps Andrea pull together a look that serves to quell all criticism about her fashion sense.  This affects the way she dresses and, ultimately, the way she acts, as she starts emulating, to some degree, the dragon lady herself.  Moreover, the suave, sexy, and sophisticated Christian (Simon Baker), who is a serious and successful writer, sweeps Andrea off her feet.  As her relationships with her boyfriend and friends start to head south due to Andrea's absorption with her career, Andrea gets a wake-up call. The only question is whether she will answer it.<br /><br />Ms. Hathaway give a coltish and engaging performance as our erstwhile journalist, and Adrien Grenier is appealing as her heart stoppingly hunky, personal chef. Christian Baker is dead sexy as the serious writer who has designs on Andrea. Stanley Tucci gives a strong performance as the stylist who helps Andrea overcome her fashion faux pas. Emily Blunt is terrific as the harried first assistant.  The standout, however, is Meryl Streep. Her coolly understated, low key performance as the ruthless and powerful Miranda Priestly gives conviction to the adage that less is more.  Her very whisper commands attention, as her performance is that powerful and should not be missed by anyone who enjoys top notch acting.  The film leaves little doubt as to why Meryl Streep merited an Oscar nomination for Best Actress.coltish and engaging performance as our erstwhile journalist, and Adrien Grenier is appealing as her heart stoppingly hunky, personal chef.

0694013889|4.0|This is a fairly good introduction for a little girl to potty training. I wouldn't expect any book to be a perfect how-to potty training manual, but this at least shows kids that this is something that all little girls go through. Like another reviewer said, I didn't like the parts where you're supposed to say \\"I, Prudence's mother\\" or similar -- it just seemed clumsy. I changed those parts to third person (\\"This is Prudence's mother...\\" .)    As a father whose two kids are now potty trained (thank goodness!), I might offer this advice to parents of toddlers: There's about a gazillion different approaches to potty training. Don't get bothered by some friend who tells you about what is supposedly the \\"right\\" way to potty train. Every child and every family is different, and you have to find what's right for you.
0743298020|4.0|At first glance, this was not a book that would ordinarily appeal to me. And yet, there was something quite intriguing about it: friends were discussing it, the cover interested me, and it is a debut novel. Once I picked the novel up, I became quite enthralled by the telling of the story, by the descriptive language and by the multiple twists and turns.<br /><br />I'm not sure how well each of the elements would work alone but I am certain that, for me, the whole package worked magnificently.  How to categorise the book?  I can't.<br /><br />Read it for yourself and make your own judgment.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith
B000000NN4|5.0|Back in the day i used to listen to a lot of rock on the radio. One day 'Pulstar' started getting airplay and i fell in love with this avant - prog yet hum-able style of rock. It was the begining of a journey i am still on. The discovery of bands like Yes (with whom Vangelis was associated), Genesis, King Crimson, etc. soon followed. But imagine a rock radio station actually pulling a 'weird' electronic piece like 'Pulstar' and playing it along side to Aerosmith and Steve Miller Band! Those were the days! Other reviewers have described this gemm all too well so i'll just add that this (IMHO) is the most prog and interestig album by Vangelis . Period. Grab it!
B000FS9FCG|4.0|The first time I watched V, I had expectations based on the trailer I'd seen when it was showing in theaters (I waited for it to get into cable rotation).  As is common, the trailer showed highlights out of context and led me to believe that it was action packed and meant to entertain.  This is of course not quite the case so the first viewing was spent waiting for what never came.  The second time around (of several viewings since) was when I began to get it, and it has since made its way toward the top of my list of all time favorites.  Some criticisms regarding a certain lack of originality are perhaps deserved, but the true power of this film is in the dialogue and in the wonderful performances of both Hugo Weaving (quite remarkable given that you actually see his face in only one short scene) and Natalie Portman who vindicates herself brilliantly after her difficult tour in the Star Wars mess.  The story itself is disturbing and meant to provoke serious thought.  Even if it is rather simplistic, it still offers a legitimate warning to those who accept \\"news\\" without skepticism and believe that all who have power deserve it.  This film's message is no less valid because of its artistic flaws.  Remember, remember indeed...
0143038419|3.0|Elizabeth Gilbert's book, \\"Eat, Pray, Love...\\" is written in her accessible, casual style; easy to read, in other words. And she is obviously a woman who cares about more than her nail polish, otherwise she wouldn't be traipsing all over the world looking for the reasons why her stateside existence is so chaotic. However, as is the case with most of us, answers to her questions about life may be closer to home than she thinks. <br />     It's an enjoyable read, this jaunt across Italy, India, and Bali, even though Ms. Gilbert's childish preoccupation with whomever (read: \\"man\\") happens to be in her life is unsettling. But she seems to have an inkling that her definition as a human being isn't dependant on male companionship, or the lack thereof. This hint of awareness was enough, when combined with her engaging style, to keep me from abandoning the book out of exasperation, at least long enough to help me get through to the end. And I'm glad I finished it.   <br />    To those of you who may be contemplating reading \\"Eat, Pray, Love...\\" let me add a few personal observations. <br />     Elizabeth Gilbert describes herself in a way that adds up to a scary total: she appears to be an alcoholic. Over the course of her narrative she mentions the prominent role alcoholism plays in her family history, describes a significant part of her life spent as a bartender, writes about buying and drinking bottles of wine \\"just for me\\" with her Italian meals, and within days of emerging from a three-month attempt at internalizing meditation as part of a new approach to living, manages to get so drunk at a Balinese bar that she can barely fight through her hangover the next day. All of this takes place as she crosses the meridian between thirty and forty years old.  <br />    Couple this observation with the beginning scenario of the book, in which she describes an emotional breakdown based on dissatisfaction with her marriage. She goes on to relate a history with four differentmood-altering substances prescribed for her and imbibed over what sounds like a significant amount of her married years. These are pills that she weans herself from over the course of her trip, declaring herself near the end of the book to be substance free. The illogic of making such a declaration shortly after describing the wine that she and her new male companion consume with their exotic meals appears to escape her. Apparently, to Ms. Gilbert, alcohol doesn't qualify as a mood-altering substance. <br />     It all sounds like classic denial. Only time will tell, of course, but it may very well turn out to be that Elizabeth Gilbert is one of the more than twenty million Americans who can't do the work it takes to live full, meaningful lives without running from the pain and trouble of everyday life. These people suffer from addiction and alcoholism, and they do massive damage to their friends and families.  <br />     There is a disturbing undercurrent through \\"Eat, Pray, Love...\\" running contrary to her self-described image as a jaunty, globe-trotting heroine in search of a better life. I hear the selfish, grandiose bravado of a frightened, immature woman who has yet to recognize that geographic cures, drugs and alcohol are all deadly enemies of self-awareness. She has yet to learn that living and loving, and doing it well, is the supreme challenge that we all share. And that without sobriety, we haven't a chance of success.   <br />
B00004RF97|5.0|#51 on the American Film Institute's Top 100 List, \\"The Philadelphia Story\\" is a 1940 comedy that has never lost its popularity. It's the film that rekindled Katherine Hepburn's then-ailing film career, the only movie James Stewart ever won an Oscar for, and a movie that Cary Grant demanded a huge salary for. Surprisingly, the movie is actually funny to this very day.  <br /> <br />Grant plays C.K. Dexter Haven, a millionaire who has recently separated from his wife Tracy Lord (Hepburn). Now, Tracy is getting remarried and Dexter has hired two people from the gossip magazine Spy to cover the marriage. They are Macaulay Connor (Stewart) and Elizabeth Imbrie. Neither one is happy to be there. Connor is on the verge of quitting his job at the Spy, as he fancies himself a writer and is sick of writing gossip articles. Elizabeth fancies herself a painter and is sick of taking photographs of rich people. Pretty soon, Connor finds himself falling for Tracy as Dexter finds himself falling for her again. <br /> <br />Stewart deserved his Oscar as he steals every scene he's in. As I said, the film is still very funny to this day (a rarity, since comedy has changed so much over the years). Anyway, \\"The Philadelphia Story\\" is not my favorite film of all time. It think there's plenty of films on the list placed beneath it that are much better, but \\"The Philadelphia Story\\" is a charming film that is definitely worth your time. <br />GRADE: A-
0307237699|3.0|Because of all the hubbub about Senator Barack Obama and his (too) early presidential campaigning, I decided to borrow a copy of his new book from the local library.  Although I had a preliminary notion that Mr. Obama would be more liberal than me, I came to the work with an open mind.  In many ways, the text was very enjoyable to read because the author seems sincere and appears to stand fully behind his convictions on the role of government.  In many places, I think that I agree with him even on policy issues (particularly in education).  However, this agreement is linked to one of the two issues which tarnished the work for me. <br /> <br />At one point in the text, Mr. Obama says that a cynical electorate is a self-centered one.   In the final analysis, he probably hits the nail directly on the head.  However, I think that he is a bit naïve in thinking that cynicism is nothing more than self-centered individualism.  While I can agree with him on some policy issues, I think that the text is by far too supportive of where the government has come to at this point.  A comment like this only affirms the fact that he is perhaps too pleased with \\"business as usual\\" or at least the reform thereof.  It seems a bit undiscerning to me that he doesn't ask the question of \\"why\\" the electorate could be cynical and then figure out that revolution, not just evolution, is necessary in the contemporary political situation. <br /> <br />Additionally, the text is peppered with relativistic though (in mild forms) throughout.  However, this is not absolute, for Senator Obama does indeed claim to have a firm belief in the rule of law and the Constitution's special place in political history.  I believe this claim to be sincere. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, his condemnation of an electorate which has been made cynical of government (because of a government which is much to be blamed) as well as his relativistic tendencies taint the work without destroying it.  I would give it a 3-3.5 / 5and suggest it if you truly want to look a bit into Senator Obama.  If you don't have a drive to do so, I would suggest staying away because the text can be a bit maudlin at times (and therefore can be boring if you haven't a personal drive to finish it).
B000O174CM|5.0|I think that anyone who believes this movie to be \\"hilarious\\" or Hudson's performance \\"overrated\\" and \\"over-the-top\\" in her singing just doesn't like musicals.  Or perhaps doesn't like an all black cast (I am not black) or is too young to understand the 60's world of music and payola and backstabbing.   <br /> <br />While touted to be similar to the experiences suffered by The Supremes with Diana Ross as its lead singer, it is close in some aspects and totally far away in others.  The key words here are \\"loosely based\\" on the story of the Supremes.  Why people, including Ross herself don't get that is beyond me! <br /> <br />Over the top? If anyone saw the original play with Jennifer Holliday (I did see it) then you don't know the meaning of over the top.  That character was supposed to be that way and Hudson did a wonderful job of that.  Her performance overrated?  Hogwash!  She deserved all the accolades she received as a novice actress. Murphy did one of his best acting jobs ever! Beyonce's performance was good but not great.  This was in part because her character while prominent was not the focus of the movie nor was it of the play. This was Beyonce's best acting performance thus far though she still needs some work and the \\"right\\" role.  This was not the right role for her in my opinion.  Hudson's character is the main and central character which puzzles me for the \\"supporting actress\\" win.  Though as lead actress she probably would have lost. <br /> <br />You people out there, don't take my word for this movie's greatness and take on a true part of history even if it was \\"white-washed,\\" no pun intended.  Or don't think its a bad movie like some other critics here.  YOU MUST JUDGE FOR YOURSELF.  I hope and think  that you won't be disappointed. There are some more than subtle references to The Supremes and Diana Ross especially in some of the costumes, Beyonce's images and album covers (CD covers for you youngsters)BUT only die hard fans of the Supremes and people who were there at that time would know that.  ENJOY.
0972169504|4.0|I finished my Ph.D. more years ago than I will admit to in public, but virtually all of what Jorge Cham writes about is true, including the long hours, the lack of money, the effect it has on your diet and even (especially) the way undergrads wear you down when you're a T. A.  (teaching assistant).  About the only difference between what he draws and the reality that I lived through (artistic license taken into account) is that PCs were not really around when I was in grad school (although they were just on the horizon).
B000FDFVZ6|3.0|I read Lucky, A Memoir by Alice Sebold and loved it.  It was so honest and captivating that I thought for sure The Lovely Bones would be similar in quality.  While I did enjoy the book, it was not the level I expected.  There are several small breaks in the story where she describes something or someone that seems to have little relevence to moving the story forward.  It is worth reading if you don't currently have anything to read, but otherwise, read Lucky instead and be done with it.
B00005JPCF|4.0|I have mixed feelings about this film.<br /><br />First, in a technical sense, it's absolutely great.  The animation is superb, the sound is excellent, and the editing is flawless.<br /><br />The actors-- particularly Robin Williams-- who do the voices are outstanding.  This is a classic showcase for the off-the-wall improvisation that Williams has always been so good at.  You have to listen very carefully, since some of the lines slip by in the action.<br /><br />The story is cute:  An adorable little penguin is born without a song, but he can dance; that is, he has happy feet.  After some heartbreak, with the assistance of loyal friends, he perseveres through many adventures and gains acceptance in the end.<br /><br />The thing that bothered me is the rather heavy-handed political message that was more or less grafted on to the end of the film.  It certainly didn't spoil the movie for me (and I actually accept the premise that humans are over-fishing the oceans), but it seemed misplaced enough to be jarring.  That is, one minute I was watching a very well done, cute little film, and the next minute, I'm supposed to feel guilty about having eaten fish and chips for dinner.  It just doesn't fit together well.<br /><br />So, I actually liked the film, though the way it was politicized disappointed me.  After having seen Happy Feet and Cars, I think Cars deserved the Oscar.  But Happy Feet is well worth seeing for the quality of its production.
B00004ZD69|5.0|I don't know how anyone can give this record a bad review.  From the second I heard the first note, I could tell I was in for a ride...just how deep and magical a ride was unknown.   <br /> <br />This album as stated before, is best listened to all at once...no interuptions, no lights...just you and the music.  People have also talked about 'God' in the same breath as Godspeed's music.  This is not far off.  I am not a religious person and don't believe in the traditional God, yet this music has a mystical and spiritual feel to it that is completely divine in nature. <br /> <br />Let it be said that this is not for everybody.  A lot of people will feel bored with some of it and feel it's too long.  These people have obviously been brought up on verse chorus, cookie cutter music for far too long and can't appriciate the amazing progression that is necessary for the music. <br /> <br />I know it is one piece of music, but my favorite track is 'Sleep'.  That piece just has a grip on me and wont let go.  Please do yourself a favor and BUY this record.  OFF.
0786856297|5.0|I held off buying THE LIGHTNING THIEF for a couple years.  The market seems glutted with YA fantasy at the moment, and I read quite a bit of it with my 9-year-old.  We've discovered several good series, but THE LIGHTNING THIEF seemed too long to hold his attention when it first came out.<br /><br />This year we noticed it in the book fair at school, then saw that it was an Accelerated Reader book.  So I picked it up and read a couple chapters to try it out.  I was 50 pages into it when I realized I needed to be reading this to my son.<br /><br />I did read it to him.  We FLEW through the book (375 pages!) in 6 days because he kept pestering me to read it to him.  We finished it up in a 5-hour marathon yesterday, hanging onto every page as Percy and his friends tried to save the world and put things to rights in their own lives.<br /><br />THE LIGHTNING THIEF is a great book for adults and kids.  I've already recommended it to a couple of adult friends who experienced the same kind of can't-put-it-down pull that I did.<br /><br />Percy Jackson, the hero of the book, comes across as every kid you'd ever meet or ever would.  He's no brainiac (he has dyslexia and ADHD) but he has friends who are.  But he is courageous and clever, stubborn and loyal.  He is the best he can be, and he's getting even better.<br /><br />Riordan works in many of the Greek myths in the novel.  There was a time when knowing Greek mythology was a pre-requisite for having a \\"classical\\" education.  Many morals and philosophies are presented in the tales.<br /><br />From the very beginning of the novel, we find out Percy is different when he ends up fighting a harpy in the museum while on a school trip.  He's been kicked out of 6 schools in 6 years, lives with his mom and step-dad, Smelly Gabe, an evil guy who deliberately makes Percy's life hard.<br /><br />Then, when he's on a well-deserved vacation with his mom, he finds out he's a Half-Blood, the son of one of the Greek gods.  But his mom doesn't know who his dad was and that's just one of the mysteries Percy ends up solving.<br /><br />The cool part of the book is peeling away all the mysteries of Percy's life and who really took Zeus's magic thunderbolt.  Along the way he gains powers that set my son's head to spinning with hope and delight.  Percy's a superhero without the costume, and there are plenty of villains in his world.<br /><br />Riordan is a teacher who obviously loves kids as well as the subject matter.  The Greek gods were a cantankerous lot, and Riordan delivers them well.  Not only does he give his readers the stories, but he also brings the gods on stage and gives them personalities.<br /><br />The series is supposed to run for 5 books.  I think it will go on longer.  I hope so.  I've already ordered books 2 and 3, and my son and I are looking forward to them.  The books take a while to read outloud to younger readers, but the effort is well rewarded.  The story is rich and deep, and will keep your child's attention.  In addition, you'd be surprised how much you can talk about even when you're not reading.  And your child may just want to wander around the internet learning more interesting facts about Greek mythology.<br /><br />THE LIGHTNING THIEF is well worth reading and is probably in most public and school libraries.t his mom doesn't know who his dad was and that's just one of the mysteries Percy ends up solving. <br /> <br />The cool part of the book is peeling away all the mysteries of Percy's life and who really took Zeus's magic thunderbolt.

B000I2JKFG|5.0|Although it seemed to compare the english government decribed within the film to our(USA) current day governmental issues/views, a view which I do not concur, it still was a well done piece of filming and approach to a complex political topic. What do you do with such a dictatorship which has been elected into power, the need to get back power to the people. It forgets about the external influences, outside terrorists, who desire to eliminate your way of life for \\"religious reasons\\". To compare the film to those who believe the US govt engineered the twin towers 9/11 attack is very much over-reaching. Still a good film. I liked it.
0486424545|5.0|A man's thesis on women's suffrage against a Dickens-like turn-of-the-century poverty backdrop, and curling the ending into the tragic death of one young impoverished man which culminates with the criminal conviction of a wealthy young man,  makes one think Russian novel -  makes one think that this was an extremely brave and ambitious project for a British author in 1910.<br /><br />The theme is basic: three children of wealth are led my the matronly eldest sister (Meg or Margaret) who monitors her younger-by-two years man-crazy sister (Helen), and their brother (Tibby) who is their junior by many more years.<br /><br />Over the period of about 6 years, she befriends Helen's beau's mother after the tryst is called off by his father.  After the untimely death of the boyfriend's mother, Meg attracts his father (Henry), weds his father, holds house for her brother, Tibby,  through his Oxford years, and tries to comprehend the wild antics of Helen. The marriage to the elder husband involves great politicking  - all in Edwardian civil obedience - with Henry's  two daughters and two sons.<br /><br />The adept ability of the Edwardian Meg to manipulate her senior and aristocratic husband displays how this \\"feeble\\" creature is in control in a seemingly \\"man's world.\\" She is the thoroughly modern Brit who discusses issues like suffrage rights and sexual equality - two topics deplored by her husband and his cronies. But, this independance is what attracts him to her.<br /><br />The civility breaks in the end when her character chides her husband - very legitimately - about how her husband's infidelity is not treated the same as her sister's adultery: \\" You have had a mistress - I forgave you. My sister has a lover - you drive her from the house. Do you see the connection? Stupid, hypocritical, cruel - oh, contemptible.\\" Wow! A woman's place was not to stand behind her man in 1910! And, sure enough, her sister stays and her husband acknowledges her harsh statements, as difficult as they are to hear, to ring true and to deserve acceptance.  In good gesture to his character, he swallows this very bitter pill.<br /><br />The last 200 pages move much better than the first 150 pages.  This novel improves as the character's personalities become more reflected in the rich and powerful dialogue presented by Forster - a master of dialogue.<br /><br />This book has much more depth than \\"Room With a View\\" and discusses issues still pertinent in this day - not something \\"Room\\" can claim.  I would recommend either book, but urge new readers to pick up and read this novel if one must choose between the two.as difficult as they are to hear, to ring true and to deserve acceptance.

0770430074|1.0|I thought this book was a waste of time when I read it. If you look at the author's past you'll see that he's from Spain and he studied a lot of philosophy. My theory on this book was that the author wanted to use his philosophic expertise in order to write an amazing book with a lot of themes and motifs. I got the whole nature, animal to human comparison or allegory. I think the author tried too hard by fluffing up his book with nonsense. It would have been a better story if he had made the story shorter, and more how do I say this, um... interesting and enjoyable I guess.<br /><br />All and all it was not a good book. I'm an AP English and U.S. History student, and i've read amazing books that use philosophy, and a lot of themes and metaphors. All I can tell you is that this book is no where close to the many accomplished works I have read.<br /><br />I think that is book is not worth your time,<br /><br />and you're better off reading anything else,<br /><br />Loran

B000LC55F2|2.0|If you like beautifully shot, well acted films with plot lines and twists that have more holes that one of those huge wheels of swiss cheese you find at the cheese maker, this film is for you.  The most impressive slight of hand here is that viewers thought this was a great story.  I don't get it.  The story fails so miserably I can't understand how this \\"thing\\" got made.  Speaking of cheese, watch closely (as the opening narrative instructs us).  Indeed.  This film does not stand up to even the lightest level of scrutiny.  I can't tell you why without spoiling the film but here goes, you've been warned.  The entire premise of the \\"scientific\\" trick (or Tesla's REAL magic trick) at the end of the movie makes absolutely no sense at all if you are the guy doing the trick you are going to die.  If you think about all those hats out in the woods and the cat, then who ever uses the device replicates himself (the person standing inside the device) and shows up in another place not to far from the device.  If you are standing in the device you are going to die as soon as that trap door opens.  Watch it and think about it for a few minutes.  It does not make any sense without killing the original magician.<br /><br />Also, there are far too many contrived scenes where the magicians are sabotaging one another after being picked to assist in a trick from among the crowd.  One will put on a disguise, go to the other's show, get picked to assist and then sabotage the trick.  How could they keep picking each other, even with the disguise, out of a crowd of volunteers in the audience?  Ridiculous.<br /><br />And that brings us to the identical twin that made the original transported man trick possible...  Are we to believe that the wife and the daughter could not tell these two apart?  Have you ever dated an identical twin?  I have and I could quickly tell one from one another.  So that aspect of the story is completely dumb.  Also, are you telling me that the guy's wife would not even know he had an identical twin?  Did a high schooler write this story?<br /><br />If the plot and twists are hard to follow (as one reviewer writes) it's because they don't make a darn bit of sense if you take a moment to consider what you've just seen.<br /><br />Again, well acted, beautiful imagery and costumes, it's well directed, and the story COULD have been good except the screen play writers didn't really think through the scenarios.<br /><br />This is a great movie picture wise, set-wise, and acting, IF you don't want to spend any time thinking about it.he had an identical twin?

B000N6TX1I|5.0|This is one of the most technically brilliant films I have ever seen. I saw it twice at the theatre and two times more as a rental.  I own only 2 DVDs at the present (which means that I rarely ever purchase them), but this film will soon become the third.  It absolutely captivated me from the beginning and never let up throughout.  The extremely long takes and innovative camera use add up to a truly unique cinematic experience.  In Entertainment Weekly, they mentioned Alfonso Cuaron on a par with Spielberg and Kubrick after this magnificent, devastating accomplishment.  Can not think of a recent film which has captivated and entertained me as much as this one.
B00001ZT6Z|5.0|Black Sabbath always pushed the limits of lyrics and the Blues. The Blues are about \\"DOOING THE DEVIL'S DUE\\", and Old Europe is full of Terror and Mystery, with Tony Iommi always having his powerful JD Guitar being played to great and classic Blues rifts, which dance to lyrics that are about such things. Remember that the band named itself after a film that was about \\"VAMPIRES\\".  <br />   On a few reviews they say that the album is superb but ignored. They are so right. Tony and the late mighty master of the Drum who was Cozy Powell wrote with singer and lyricist Tony Martin, some of the darkest and most high pitched music that they were to ever write in thier careers, of which it is said that this was the most frightining album that they ever wrote, in dealing with the Occult and other such Terror.  <br />    My favorite songs are Kill In the Spirit World and Call of The Wild, with Kill In the Spirit World being a song that makes me think about the old Mystery films, put in Clash of the Titans if one could say, while Call of The Wild for me has always been a Bond Song rejected. The sound is too remining of the Bond Theme, and as for the other songs one will have to hear them for themselves, but they are amazing.  <br />
B000F8O35U|1.0|There's no way to put a good spin on this bad plot. Little meek Ariel gives up her VOICE to get the man. Not too subtle, is it? The interesting woman in the movie - that wicked old wet witch - is the smart, intelligent, proactive and powerful woman. Why can't Disney offer women role models who are powerful, smart and GOOD?<br /><br />Powerful women are scary so they must be EVIL and seek to harm and diminish and denigrate other women. So much for sisterhood. It's very disappointing that in the 21st Century, we're still peddling this extremely negative message to little girls.<br /><br />And what must Ariel give up in order to have her man? Let's see...her voice, her talent, her home, her dreams, but alas, it's all worth it. Or so we're led to believe. Yuck.<br /><br />I am profoundly disappointed that these type of movies are still popular amongst parents and children alike.
B000MV9026|5.0|I saw this at the movies when it came out here, and was really impressed.   So I bought it on DVD knowing exactly that this will be enjoying to watch for all ages, adult and children alike.  Good Family Viewing.
B000MXPE7O|4.0|Was I the only one who had trouble following the plot of this film?  This is not usually a problem area for me, but there were so many characters and short, cryptic encounters that I found several scenes plain confusing.  The terrific cast is not given much leeway, and the Matt Damon character, in particular, has an emotional repertoire that ranges from A to B; while clearly the intent of the film, it offers few clues to his inner life.  And while the film did an an amazing job of recreating past eras (the suburban scenes looked exactly like of our old family photos) I was also troubled by the blending of factual context and fiction.  I give it 4 stars more for the production values than for the content.
B000067FYG|1.0|First of all this film is a mockery of the classic cartoon.  Scooby looks nothing like himself and Shaggy is played over the top by Matthew Lillard who looks nothing like Shaggy.  I could get over these points however but the movie was completely boring with no plot, just a showcase for lackluster special effects.  Then about half way through Scrappy Doo who is upset because he didn't get what he wants decides to take revenge and PEES all over the girls.  I could not believe they would put such filth in a movie geared toward families and children.  The people who made this film are really sick in the head and should think about working on more adult oriented films to satisfy their obvious \\"creative\\" needs.  I have no problem with adult material but it belongs in an R or NC-17 rated film.  Films like this are the ones giving Hollywood a bad name.  Kids might think its funny when a dog pees on someone but kids also think just about anything is funny.  Like it or not Kids learn alot from movies and TV about acceptable behavior and tend to emulate what they think is funny for attention.  How many children after seeing this film threw a tantrum and then peed on one of their siblings or parents?<br /><br />What a way to ruin a good series with an awful movie and then some dog pee.
B000IZJ1KC|4.0|I didn't really know what to expect when I bought this album. I knew i was a fan of Immortal's last album 'Sons Of Northern Darkness'. I figured it would be something along those lines. I was mistaken, and delightfully surprised. 'I' features members from Immortal, Enslaved, and Gorgoroth. It is heavy metal with a hint of black metal, and the crisp blackend vocals of Immortals own Olve Eikemo (Abbath). The songs are very catchy and extremely unique. It's a must for any fan of black metal or any one seeking out something new.
014027409X|4.0|Unlike most dystopian novels, which tend to focus on what may happen to government in the future, \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" focuses on the nature of the individual in the future. Our protagonist is Alex, only 15 years old but already a habitual criminal, roving the streets with his band of friends, taking advantage of every opportunity to wreak havoc on the world around him. The boys have no qualms about attacking the helpless. In fact, the more helpless the victim, it seems, the more pleasure the boys take in the act. The most interesting and disturbing aspect is that the boys manage to maintain a strange sort of innocence even as they commit the most heinous and violent crimes. They aren't doing any of this out of malice toward their targets; in fact, it seems to matter very little who they pick as a victim. They are creating mayhem just because it's fun for them.<br /><br />Everything changes, however, when one particular break-in goes horribly awry and Alex finds himself sentenced to 14 years in prison for murder. There, though he manages to create an illusion of good behavior, we see that the experience has no real impression on his sense of morality. Then, after two years, he is chosen for a new, experimental rehabilitation program, designed to rid him of any desire to indulge in, or even contemplate, any acts of violence. As we see, however, this \\"treatment\\" also leaves him without any choice in the matter of being good or not. He HAS to be good because he is programmed to be. This, of course, raises the question central to the book: Does good behavior actually mean you are a good person if you have no freedom of choice?<br /><br />The book can be a little difficult to get in to at first, predominantly because of Burgess's unique style. The story is narrated by Alex and thus, is written in the complex slang language, invented by Burgess for this book, that the youth of this society engage in. For example, a sentence taken from the opening chapter: \\"He looked a malenky bit poogly when he viddied the four of us like that\\" (pg. 5). There is no glossary, but if you stick with it, you will start to develop a feel for what most of the words mean after a couple chapters. However, if you find yourself having difficulty, a nice, comprehensive lexicon can be found on Wikipedia if you search for \\"English to Nadsat\\" (due to review guidelines I am not allowed to include a direct link). Unfortunately, it is alphabetized by the English equivalents, not by the slang terms, so looking up a word can be a little difficult.<br /><br />One final note of interest: The original British publication of \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" had 21 chapters, as does the current American edition. However, when the book was first published in the United States, the last chapter was dropped. As Burgess explains in his introduction to the restored version, publishers considered this 21st chapter a sellout. Whether it is or isn't is up to you to decide, but I can tell you that the presence or absence of the last chapter makes a huge difference in the overall feel and message of the book. Without the final part of the story in place, the book offers a bleak message, implying that human nature cannot really change. On the other hand, reading the book with the final chapter in place gives us a little more hope. Beyond that, Burgess tells us in his introduction, interpretation is up to you.<br /><br />This review refers to the restored, 1986 Norton & Company edition.malenky bit poogly when he viddied the four of us like that\\" (pg. 5).

B000002KFJ|5.0|Sabotage is where Ozzy and the gang did the ultimate thing- they made the heaviest album of the 70's.  The debut was heavy, Master of Reality was REALLY heavy, but Sabotage is KING of heavy, baby.  It's also a very emotionally angry album with lots of screaming and twisted lyrics from Ozzy. <br /> <br />\\"hole in the sky\\" opens the album with an almost orchestra-conducting like guitar riff, and the drumming is quite excellent as well.  Nobody knows what the lyrics are in the chorus- is Ozzy saying \\"take me to heaven\\" or \\"gateway to heaven?\\"  That's for YOU to decide!  After the song ends, \\"don't start (too late)\\" comes in next.  It's just an extremely brief acoustic bit that leads into the next song.  However, even though the song is not even a minute long, it's worth mentioning.  Why does it sound so familiar?  I think I heard that same acoustic melody on a PBS show, like Nova or something.  Really!  I'm not kidding! <br /> <br />The next song is not only an amazing song, but an extremely influential song as well.  It must have been responsible for Metallica and countless other bands forming.  What is this song, and why is it so important?  It's called \\"symptom of the universe\\".  It's a, and I kid you not, THRASH metal song.  Yup, in the mid 70's Black Sabbath created thrash metal.  Listen to that guitar riff.  It's unlike anything Sabbath or any other band had done before.  Also worth noting is how the song ENDS with a switch in melody (the \\"switching\\" point is ripped from a 10cc song, shhhh, I won't tell!) to an acoustic guitar.  Why am I mentioning this, you wonder?  Because every other metal band must have heard this idea, and thought it would be better to switch the acoustic bit to the BEGINNING of their songs, before the electric guitars kicked in.  With \\"symptom of the universe\\" the song actually ends on an acoustic note.  God, Ozzy positively SCREAMS throughout this song.  It's amazing how his voice was able to hold up! <br /> <br />\\"megalomania\\" is probablythe longest Sabbath song in history (well, besides the blues jam on the debut album).  It's nearly 10 minutes in length, and put together nicely.  One nice vocal melody that jumps straight into another one, with a short piano solo in the middle leading into a faster, angrier part.  \\"FEEL IT slipping away, slipping in tomorrow, now I found my happiness, from the depths of sorrow!\\"  Good lyrics.  At least, a girl I once tried to impress liked the lyrics.  We were meant to be together, but then, I chickened out and couldn't ask her out on a date.  Anyway, another thing about the song I want to mention is how the guitar riff you start hearing around the halfway point turns crunchier with every time it repeats.  I didn't notice it until a few listens in.  Also, really neat studio trickery with dark creepy voices repeating every line Ozzy says can be heard in the background.  What a track! <br /> <br />\\"the thrill of it all\\" has a nice riff in the beginning, before turning soft and Brady Bunch-like towards the end.  The lyrics are worth noting, with Ozzy talking about Mr. Jesus and believing in man.  \\"supertzar\\" is nothing but a bunch of Gregorian chants.  I don't even know what they are, but they dominate the song!  NO WAY Ozzy can be one of the male singers doing those voices.  I simply refuse to believe it!  Probably Bill Ward is one singer.  Really good song, and the electric guitar riffs that blaze nice and neatly behind those voices is something metal fans can brag about, too.   <br /> <br />\\"am I going insane (radio)\\" is memorable for that fuzzy vibrating thingy playing in the background.  It keeps vibrating back and forth!  Sort of like the song \\"paranoid\\" did, now that I think about it.  It may have been a hit at one time, but no more, says I.  I also believe \\"am I going insane\\" was ripped from an old Pink Floyd song on the Relics album.  Ozzy, care to share whether or not this is true?  You know it is. <br /> <br />\\"the writ\\" is a very angry song lyrically, andthe emotions this song delivers are especially interesting.  Actually, it's the way Black Sabbath manages to combine those lyrics with the shifts in musical direction that really amazes me.  For example, the song turns into a lullabye at the end with Ozzy wanting people to sympathize with his words, and then a sign of hope appears when the melody switches and the guitar comes in with Ozzy singing \\"a smiling face it means the world to me, yeah\\" and \\"but everything is gonna work out fine, yeah\\".  A hard rock band that was actually able to make the music match the lyrics, even when it kept switching around through different melodies and emotions.  Awesome!  That's the one thing Black Sabbath did extremely well. <br /> <br />Overall, Sabotage is Black Sabbath at their angriest and loudest.
B000EGDAI4|5.0|The other customer reviews of this CD criticize the audio quality, but they overlook the fact that this recording is a CLASSIC by any standard. While any criticism of the remastering may be valid, don't pass up this historic work by a true master.
B000002KIK|5.0|This is it.  The last Black Sabbath album with Ozzy Osbourne as their lead singer.  He had to go.  Drugs were getting the best of him, a solo career was unexpectedly ready to launch for him, and well, the band and the music scene was changing, and well, to sum this sentence up, everything must come to an end. <br /> <br />But luckily they went out with a bang, as Never Say Die is a surprisingly good album.  The title song is almost like Sabbath's PUNK song, and it's pretty good.  It's fast, heavy, and intense.  \\"johnny blade\\" is like a comic book come to life.  The song reminds me of buildings and Spiderman.  Ozzy has a weird sound to his voice in this song.  It's like he's trying to progress his voice into something else.  Well, it works. <br /> <br />\\"junior's eyes\\" is such a sad song about Ozzy's father.  I really like it.  The song reminds me of an open field that doesn't ever end.  It's strange how the band members supposedly didn't get along while this album was recorded, and yet, they all seemed to throw their hatred out the window when recording this song in particular.   <br /> <br />\\"a hard road\\" reminds me of that old Tommy James song \\"draggin' the line\\" with its chugging-along basslines.  It's strangely addicting the way Ozzy sings happy meaningful lyrics about never giving up no matter what at the very end, while the rest of the band chants \\"oooooooooh, it's a harrrrrrrrrd rooooooooad\\".  This is a really good song. <br /> <br />\\"shock wave\\" is a LOUD rocker, that doesn't really do much of standing out, but does its job of kicking my butt all over the room.  \\"air dance\\" maybe was ripped off from Van Morrison's \\"moondance\\".  Both songs have a jazzy and bouncy rhythm section going on, however \\"air dance\\" offers a very cocktail-ish like romantic adult evening party (beside the beach in southern California!) atmosphere.  It's a mature song with really neat guitar playing.  Oh, and the riff that opens the song is really sad. I kid you not!  It goes like this-\\"do do do, de do do DO do do\\".  Okay, words don't do the thing justice.  lol <br /> <br />\\"over to you\\" with its Price is Right melody (by the way, Bob Barker's retiring this year) is a really neat song.  I love the lyric \\"standing inside myself\\" because only Ozzy would sing a line like that.  Strange song.  What is \\"breakout\\"?  Does Black Sabbath think they're some kind of jazz band now?  Well, whatever they think, it's what I think that matters.  I enjoy it!  I DIDN'T enjoy it the first time, though.   <br /> <br />\\"swinging the chain\\" reminds me of a courtroom.  \\"to be a civil judge!\\"  Bill Ward really rocks out on this track.  I dig it, baby. <br /> <br />Maybe Black Sabbath hated this album, and wished it never happened.  I'm glad it did.  I love the thing.  I'll always love you Black Sabbath.
1582701709|5.0|The Secret was recommended to me by my Mom and it is now one of my favorite books.  I can honestly say that it is making a difference in my life. I have already read it several times and keep it in my handbag and re-read sections of it on my way to work ( I take the train to the office and can read to and from work). It is an easy read and after completing it the first time, filled me with hope and excitement of my own power to make things happen in my life. The hard part was training myself to get rid of the negative thoughts I constantly had, and my favorite part was writing down what I am grateful for.  Here are just a few examples of the differences in my life after applying The Secret and the Law of Attraction: <br />**Despite the amount of weight I have lost in the last few months, I would continue to focus on the weight I still needed to lose. I decided to be grateful for what I have lost and I imagined myself wearing my size 2 clothes (which hadn't fit in over a year) and looking great.  Needless to say, I am now wearing my size 2 clothes and feel better than ever. <br />**For at least 3 years I told myself that by the time I was 30 years old, I would have my own office, work for a large firm in downtown, and have my own secretary.  I didn't know how it would happen, but I held onto my faith and I am pleased to say that I am 30 years old now and have been working at a job that I absolutely love for close to a year now, with a great office overlooking downtown and an amazing secretary.   <br />**A little over a year ago, I had a nasty breakup with someone who is wrong and horrible for me in everyway possible.  My self-esteem was in the dumps and I barely recognized the person I had become. I successfully cut off all contact with him, even changing my cell and home numbers.  Still, despite the fact that I am (thankfully) no longer the same person I was when we dated and am so much happier and at peace that he is no longer a part of my life, I found myself thinking of him again, one year after the breakup.  2 weeks ago I was leaving my home for an early morning run when I found a note from him on my doorstep saying how he had been thinking of me a lot lately, and that he wanted to see me and provided a phone number to reach him. I truly believe he manifested (unintentionally) in my life as a result of the fact that I started to think about him on an almost daily basis... <br />If you have an open mind and are ready to make changes in your life, I highly recommend The Secret.  <br />
B000KCHZK6|1.0|I don't usually review music on Amazon as it is clearly such a matter of taste, but since I am (maybe \\"was\\") a huge Norah fan I pre-ordered this just assuming I would love.  I did not.  After three attempts to listen to it this CD has been put in a cabinet and forgotten.  The Little Willies CD was great, so if you haven't heard that and are dying for some good Norah give that a try.  This was just \\"ugggh\\".
B000002MFN|4.0|\\"Erotica\\" has to be one of Madonna's most underrated albums, and a lot of people turned on her after its release, which had nothing to do with the album's content, but that godawful \\"SEX\\" book.<br /><br />The majority of the songs are nothing short of amazing, but there is one track missing from this version (and rightly so). The absolutely horrid \\"Did You Do It?\\", a remix of \\"Waiting\\", was not included here, a motion which I second. As a matter of fact, it should never have been released. Madonna hardly sings in it, and the rapping is so incredibly cheesy and disgusting.<br /><br />I love tracks 2, 3, 4, 8, 10, 11, and 13 (or 14, depending on which version you're buying).<br /><br />I hope you can forget the \\"SEX\\" experience and buy this. It's not as bad as you might think.
0143038419|5.0|I see a lot of bad review here. The call the author selfish, egocentric narcissistic. Well, this IS about the author and her experience, both internal and external. It seems readers want the author to conform to their idea of what is \\"right spirituality\\". I suppose there is not enough  Christian belief, religious orthodoxy nor fasting. There is much projection going on from the critics her. Spirituality  can be found in simple things, believe it or not. It can be found in food, wine, youth, health, joy. As it can also be found in pain and suffering, fasting and sacrifice. Everyones path is valid and beautiful. This is wonderful book. And those that projecting their fears or ideas of right and wrong have found in this a tool too look deepen inside an rid themselves of deeply held beliefs that impede the flow of compassion and love. This book is great. Descriptive and a could almost enjoy that pizza, I could almost taste it! God is everywhere, consciousness is in everything and everything is in consciousness.
B000NA1Z1A|2.0|THIS REVIEW DEALS ONLY WITH THE EDITING OF CURSE WORDS FOR THE CLEAN ALBUM.    I bought the clean version of this album because she uses the \\"f\\" word in several songs on the other version and I have young children.  The edited version is a disappointment. The curse words are clumsily half-blotted out, leaving an awkward space in the songs, while the phrase, \\"You don't mean [...] to me\\"  remains untouched.  I will still have to press the skip button, which negates the whole point of buying a clean version! If the Black Eyed Peas and Jay-Z can come up with alternate lyrics for some of their edited songs, then certainly Amy Winehouse's handlers could have done the same.
B000LC55F2|5.0|The Prestige is the \\"other\\" film about magicians, which came out right around the time of The Illusionist.  Although on the surface the two films seem to be set in similar time periods about similar subjects, they couldn't be more different.<br /><br />The Prestige is about two magicians and their obsessive quest to one-up each other. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) is a polished American magician who performs with his wife, fellow British magician Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and gizmo inventor Cutter (Michael Caine).  When Angier's wife drowns during a trick, he blames Borden for the deed.  Borden's unsatisfying response to which knot he tied is, \\"I don't know.\\"<br /><br />That burning question (\\"How could he not know?\\") consumes Angier and sets the tone for the movie.  But this is esteemed director Christopher Nolan we're talking about, so nothing is that simple.  The movie has multiple layers.  It's broken into three parts (the Pledge, the Turn, and the Prestige).  But it's also a duel between the two magicians, consuming everything from their friends (Cutter) to their wives to their mistresses (Olivia Wenscombe, played by Scarlett Johansson) to their very children, retold through each of their respective diaries.  It's also a battle of magic vs. technology, illusion vs. reality, showmanship vs. stagecraft. Nolan poses the question: When does a single-minded quest for perfection become ruthless enough to commit murder?<br /><br />The twists and turns in the film aren't too hard to follow; astute viewers will pick up on the secrets behind both magicians' acts.  What's really terrifying is the little sins that magicians commit in performing their illusions.  What happens to all cute those bunnies and pigeons that disappear?  You don't want to know.<br /><br />If The Prestige has a flaw, it's that the movie takes so long to reveal the entirety of its performance and deception. Still, the gut-punch ending is worth the wait.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|This movie was a fairly realistic representation of life aboard a British Navy ship in the Pacific Ocean west of South America. You could almost smell the stench of the crew, and their food looked less than appetizing. The cinematography, editing, costumes, story, acting were all top-rate. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. There is little if any offensive language or sex. There are realistic battle scenes with appropriate violence which may not be suitable for children. The humanistic side of the movie was wonderful, for example the captain and doctor playing their music. Russell Crowe was a brilliant captain who has to make tough decisions.
B000002UWP|5.0|Besides the ultracool roxers like \\"Knockin' on Every Door\\" and  <br />\\"Physical Fascination\\" just to name a few,  <br />what stands out for me above all is the beauty  <br />of the songs; \\"Watercolors in the Rain\\", \\"Spending my Time\\",  <br />\\"Perfect Day\\"......all of them. <br /> <br />I am always surprised how much I still love this album after  <br />over 15 years of listening!  <br />I wonder why? And the answer is: I don't know. <br />
B000LXH0AE|1.0|The movie itself was pretty good - however, there is a good chance this movie will not play in your DVD player. <br /> <br />Sony added a new copy protection scheme to this DVD which causes the movie to be unplayable in many DVD players.  Many different players from different manufacturers are affected.  I learned of this problem after it did not work in my RCA DVD player, and searched on the internet and found many others with the same problem. <br /> <br />So, there is a good chance that this movie will not be playable, and I don't recommend purchasing it.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|This has to be the most touching score to a movie I have ever appreciated. <br />Watching the movie was one thing but then listening to the score blew me away. I could find myself crying just hearing the music and placing it at the point in the story. <br />What a range of music. So well done and so different. The song selection for the different scenes in the movie just fit. It is as if each song was the perfection for its placement in the movie. <br />The score can hold it's own in itself but together they are as one.
B000062YB1|5.0|War Ensemble , Dead Skin Mask, Seasons in the Abyss, Hallowed Point, Blood Red, basically every track is excellent. Slayer can play better then any band around, new or old. Sure Kerry and Jeff have to look at their guitars when they play, but who cares? No band can do it better then Slayer.

John Grisham writing about his trip to toilet in a form of a novel where a hero battles constipation?  <br /> <br />The days of Rainmaker, Firm and Partner are long gone.
B000M3452Y|5.0|LCD Soundsystem is more than your average electronica band, they offer far more than that. Like Underworld [[ASIN:B00006JBKQ A Hundred Days Off]] before them they are truly breaking new ground in the mix of punk, dance and indie music. You can hear more on the latest podcast over at [...]
6304806418|5.0|I haven't heard the original cast recording so I can't compare this to it but, I think this is a very good movie/musical. Madonna and Antonio Banderas did a great job! The music is really good.This musical is not as good as The Phantom of the Opera but it is hard to be better than Phantom. You MUST see EVITA!
B000784WMW|4.0|I recently rented this BBC version of Jane Eyre with Timothy Dalton. <br />I did see that the character of Jane is a closer version of what Jane in the book would have been like as well as some others such as Mr. Rivers. Timothy Dalton, in my opinion, was a very attractive Rochester when there were concerns that Toby was too attractive for Rochester in the masterpiece version as well.  All in all I liked it. There were the differences of course on the way the actors represented the characters but you would expect that. The scene that took place in the outdoors in the Masterpiece and taking place in doors in BBC when Rochester declares his love for Jane was the biggest difference to me. Both were well done. Just in my preference I liked the outdoor version better.  <br />I can see why this version is so well loved. Had I seen this one before the newer version (only my preference) I still liked the Masterpiece version. This is still the version that I would have watched first had I known about it. It would have made for a better appreciation for the differences.
1416503730|5.0|This was one of the first books I read that actually made me laugh outloud while reading.  It has suspense, romance and humor. And I wish I had a neighbor like Jaine's (main character).
B000F2C7TU|5.0|This has been one of Whitesnake's weakest albums IMHO, but the remaster has completely changed the sound of this album. The pumping bass of Neil Murray is very evident and gives the songs new life. Nice job EMI!
0743496728|5.0|I think that this is the best book I've read by Picoult thus far.  I liked the fact that the book details all sides of the story.  Another reviewer suggested that there is a surprise ending that does not make sense-this is not true.  The \\"surprise\\" is not really surprising, as it is foreshadowed throughout the entire book and makes for a good ending.  I would recommend this book!
0151013047|4.0|A riveting narrative that ends so abruptly, yet brilliantly, this is certainly a book that lingers with you with it's post 9/11 views. I agree with another reviewer that at it's slim 180 pages or so, it's best to try and read it all in one sitting for maximum impact.
0330351699|5.0|At first glance, the story would seem to have little significance.  A drifter from an affluent family spends a summer in Alaska living in the wilderness and ends up starving to death.  But Krakauer extensive research into the matter and great story telling skills allow the reader to see the motivations behind Christopher McCandless quest.  Clearly, Krakauer strongly identifies with McCandless, which drove him to write such a compelling book that is more than simply a story of someone who challenged nature and lost.  It's also a story about a family coming to grips with the loss of someone they simply didn't understand.  Christopher's father certainly had some human failings, but you sense his frustration in that he tried to do what was best for his son, and tried to be the best father he could, with results that left his son essentially abandoning him after college to discover the world on his own terms.  Krakauer describes the similar relationship he had with his father. <br /> <br />And yet, the book never feels like some sort of self indulgent vehicle for Krakauer.  He has too much sympathy for the story's characters, and is quite willing to explain the passions people like himself and McCandless have  in challenging nature to the reader who doesn't share them.  Krakauer spends a chapter describing a daring climb in Alaska where he nearly lost his life.  Krakauer knew going into the climb that it required a dangerous scaling of an ice cliff over a thousand feet high with only a couple ice picks to support him.  And yet this passage is not about Krakauer's bragging about his daring-do, but about his foolishness, the self-indulgent nature of the quest, and why he would risk his life for something only a few elite mountain climbers could truly appreciate.  Krakauer feels that McCandless acted in the same manner to attempt to survive in the Alaskan wilderness with few supplies, and it could have very well been Krakauer falling to his death, with a family left to grieve. <br /> <br />This book wouldn't work if Krakauer wasn't such a good story teller.  Someone going into the wilderness and starving to death is a story that doesn't have a lot of action to it.   The story is greatly fleshed out from McCandless's diary and interviews with people he met along his extensive travels prior to his fatefull trip to Alaska.   The result is very compelling. <br />
0060090383|5.0|I first read Rachel's Holiday waaaaay back in 2000, right after I started reading romance again.  I read Keyes's Watermelon first, didn't like it much, then was blown away by Lucy Sullivan Is Getting Married, then was dismayed to find nothing else Keyes on the library shelf.  Back in 2000 Keyes didn't have all that much of a backlist, even less in America.  I checked amazon.co.uk to see when her next was due, and found out it was still a while.  Then serendipitously, while browsing in a discount bookstore, I found a British copy of Rachel's Holiday just sitting there waiting to be discovered by an American reader.  I snapped it right up, took it home, and read it practically in one sitting.<br /><br />What I remember most is pouring over the Luke bits.  To my relatively unexplosed romance mind, they were scorching.  Luke was da man, even in his leather pants.  I was completely jealous that this other Rachel had him.  The rest of the book, all of the addiction stuff, was pretty good too.<br /><br />Anyway, this book has been sitting untouched  on my bookshelf since 2000, just gathering dust.  Then a week or so ago, I saw something on the internet, a reader's recommendation, that made me want to pick it up again.  I thought it was every bit as good as I found it the first time around, but for different reasons.<br /><br />Rachel Walsh is in a muddle.  Everyone in her life is upset at her, and her transplanted Irishman's life in NYC is about to come to an abrupt end and all because she accidentally took a few too many pills one night and ended up in the emergency room getting her stomach pumped.  This could happen to anyone, she feels, but her friends, her boyfriend, Luke, and her family feel differently.  Before she knows it, she's on a plane back to Ireland and, from there, incarcerated in a treatment facility, the Cloisters, for drug addiction.  Rachel went along with the hysteria because she'd heard of the Cloisters - its famous \\"clients\\" and its fabulous spa-like facilities - but now that she's there, things aren't quite as she'd expected.<br /><br />They're treating her as if she were like the other losers there - a real addict.  And that's not so posh nor so funny.<br /><br />What I'd forgotten about this book is how funny it is, in a dark sort of way.  The humor isn't black, but it's pretty tarnished.  A nice dark gray.  Rachel's observations about her surroundings and her problems are both cutting and self-deprecating at the same time.  I laughed continually throughout, so much so that Max finally got sick of it, and told me to \\"Knock ert off, Mommy!\\"  He wanted to know what the joke was.<br /><br />Keyes pulls off a pretty intereresting narratorial feat with Rachel, making her snobbish and humble at the same time, taking her time in revealing the true Rachel.  This is even more impressive as the book is done in first person which normally reveals more than it conceals.  Here, however, Rachel is so befogged by her addiction and her denial that she sees life and her history differently at different parts of the novel.  First person POV, when done well, is good for creating intimacy with the reader and getting the reader to side with the protagonist, which is why Rachel initially seems \\"just misunderstood\\" by those surrounding her.  But as the layers of Rachel's onions are peeled away during her Cloisters stay, incidents take on new shades of meaning, and Rachel herself becomes quite multi-dimensional.  There is one scene with her parents that manages to dig a well of character depth in just a few short pages and makes you ache for Rachel and understand her in a completely new way.<br /><br />The drug addiction and recovery process is examined fully, but not in textbook fashion.  All of the information Keyes imparts flows naturally from the narrative, never seeming false, but illuminating addiction and the addictive personality with a bright beam.  This is what I found fascinating to read this time around - how all of these diverse people Rachel meets have the same problems with addiction and all of the same attendant deviant behaviors.  Unlike lots of stories about addiction, however, this one ends hopefully, with the understanding that recovery is ongoing and a great deal of work, but possible.<br /><br />Rachel's romance with her boyfriend Luke is told mainly in flashback and is a significant portion of the novel, not so much because the romance is crucial but because the way Rachel interacted with Luke illuminates how much of a problem she truly had with drugs and alcohol and self-esteem.  Luke himself is pretty wonderful, very scrumptious, and provides most of the lighter touches the novel needs to keep it from being bogged down with weighty issues.<br /><br />All in all this is a wonderful novel about addiction and the long process of recovery, full of dark  (occasionally raunchy) humor and some nice tender romantic parts.  Two thumbs up from me.und - how all of these diverse people Rachel meets have the same problems with addiction and all of the same attendant deviant behaviors.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This is a beautiful adaptation of a classic.  The Clarke/Dalton version still holds pride of place in my opinion, but for those who are not Eyre purists, this one will definitely not disappoint (unlike the more recent \\"Hollywood\\" versions.)  The cinematography is fantastic and the casting superb.  This would be the version I would recommend to a non-Eyre-ophile due to the overall quality of the production.  It really was nicely done!   <br /> <br />

B000N6TX1I|2.0|\\"Children of Men\\" starring Clive Owen, Julianne Moore, and Michael Caine is rated R and was directed by Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n. The film opens on a decaying London street in the year 2027. Women are no longer fertile and 18 years earlier the last human baby was born. Great Britain is the last outpost of western civilization in a world bereft of hope and in chaos. It's in this dark version of the future where Theo, the main character, is coerced into escorting the world's only pregnant woman to the human project.<br /><br />I have two sons, 18 and 20, who wanted to see \\"Children of Men\\". On different nights each started to watch but, neither found it interesting enough to watch to the end. Billed as a Sci-Fi, adventure, thriller, it's none of these. The only aspect that even remotely made it a sci-fi film was the pretext that it occurs in 2027. As far as a thriller, it's a dud. I will give it two stars for adventure. There were several chase scenes and a couple of shootouts. The quasi Arab uprising in the Gaza strip being put down by the Israeli/American troops was well done though hard to believe. Where the heck did all those guns and rockets come from and weren't they supposed to be British troops?<br /><br />This movie was a waste of time and money. The misleading trailers set it up as a bait and switch. It's a political film about immigration that's badly done. The actors seem depressed and none of the characters were engaging. Had the manic refugee camp guard played the hero and the terrorist leader who betrayed Julianne Moore's character been his nemesis this would have been a much more interesting movie.<br /><br />The cover of the DVD refers to the revolutionary themes of the movie. I think this is one of the problems. The overall theme is one of moral relativism and that weakens the characters when they deal with underlying themes of rich and poor, capitalism, faith, immigration, illegal drugs, euthanasia, terrorism, betrayal, corruption, hopelessness, and violence against those who are different.<br /><br />If you want to make a pro immigration film great, just don't trick me into watching it.olence against those who are different. <br /> <br />If you want to make a pro immigration film great, just don't trick me into watching it.
0743496728|5.0|Yes, if only this book were in the REQUIRED reading list for  students perhaps in the ninth grade...there might not be so much school violence. Perhaps High School could even be a pleasant experience for the vast majority!!!(that's aiming high, I know!)Fiction has a way of drawing us in and making us feel what others are feeling. (even though this book is fiction, I know from hearing her speak that a lot of research went into it)  Parents should read this too. I've been recommending this book to many people.  It touches everyones's lives in one way or another in a way that no other fictional book other than perhaps \\"The Pact\\" (also by Picoult), does. Honestly, the FIRST thought I had after finishing the book was that EVERYONE should read it....It is THAT valuable and perhaps...necessary.  Thank-you Jodi! Sincerely, Arden Detweiler
B000MRA5NS|5.0|Blu-ray HD definitely gives 007 a whole new quality in action.  Aside from the awe-inspiring HD quality, the action is also great.  Take note that this is James Bond's first movie as a 00 agent so don't expect any high gadgetries.
B000244FDW|5.0|This version of Pride and Prejudice is the best of several good ones.  It follows the book closely and captures beautifully the spirit of Jane Austin.  Elizabeth Garvie IS Elizabeth Bennett! Mrs. Bennett and Mr. Collins are also especially well portrayed.  While acurately depicting the 19th century, the story transcends the times by the faithful portrayal of character, which is the central theme of Jane Austen. Not even the excellent 1995 BBC version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle quite comes up to this 1985 DVD edition (miniseries made by BBC in 1979).
B000MQ54OY|4.0|Good video to have and collect, especially if you have kids.  The HD quality is the actual selling point on this and you are not gonna get dissapointed.  My 2-year old son loves it and everytime the penguins dance, he goes along with them.  It also has a special feature on how to tap dance like Mumble in the movie.
B000002GQG|5.0|I own 14 Moody Blues albums and this is my favorite one . The band's ability to learn 37 different instument including Mike Pindar's mastery of the mellotron is remarkable all in and of itself . The album contains my favorite Moody Blues song , Voices In The Sky . While this album never received the critical acclaim that was given to Days Of Future Passed , it was more like the other 5 concept albums . Yes , the material is some what dated , but , this is the begining of the art rock era . Any one who likes the band should own this .

B000002GQH|5.0|I rate this as my third favorite Moody Blues album behind In Search Of The Lost Chord and Seventh Sojourn . Are You Sitting Comfortably ? is my second favorite Moody Blues song . The first half of the album has some of the most pop oriented songs that the band ever did in it's second incarnation . The last 4 cuts must be listened to as a single piece . This is the first of the \\"art rock\\" bands and they were paving the way for the rest of them . It's amazing to think that they were able to get noticed at all by the general public in an era when radio stations refused to play ANY songs that ran over 3 minutes in length . This album is a facinating part of history and should be in every Moody Blues fan's collection.
1400049628|4.0|My husband laughs at me because I discuss the logistics of zombie warfare.  We live above a Starbucks in a secure building; if zombies attacked we could saw a hole in the floor and drop into Starbucks (provided no zombies were made there while getting a grande mocha latte) and stock up on provisions and biscotti.  The narrow staircases could be blocked and the zombies would have to break the glass to turn the handles of the electronic secure doors, which they probably aren't smart enough to do.  As long as they didn't pile up at the base of the building and build a ramp up to the balcony, they probably couldn't get us.  If you think like this, \\"The Zombie Survival Guide\\" is for you.  My weapons enthusiast brother in law said the research was accurate.  He wouldn't comment about the zombie portion.  He thinks I'm a nut.
B000002GQL|5.0|While this is not my personal favorite , it is the most commercial of the 7 concept albums . It is a stylistic bridge to the band's later work . The weakest cut is When You're A Free Man . Even though it marked the end of the band's 2nd incarnation ( remember Go Now ) it really doesn't come off that way . I have 14 of their albums , including all 7 concept albums ( in vinyl and CD ) and this is the one I would recommend to the casual fan . This is the first art rock band that was commercially successful . King Crimson , E L P and Yes all came later . It is unfortunate that this , last album arrived at a time when the art rock era was just starting . It actually propelled sales of the band's earlier work . The band would have even more wildly popular had Days Of Future Past been released in 1971 instead of 1967 . This is the only album of their's to be released during tha art rock era and by the time they got back together , the era had passed .
B000DWMN2S|5.0|I saw this movie a year ago and was deeply impressed and moved by it. Today was Israel's official Holocaust Memorial day and seeing the movie  was on TV, I took a chance and suggested my 13- and 10-year old daughters to watch with me. This was a unique experience, the movie's bitter-sweet, understated approach to the holocaust horrors allowed them to have an entertaining experience (in the first half) as well as educating and moving (in the second half). All of us were driven to tears as the movie reached its heart-breaking climax. Overall, highly recommended
B000001ES4|5.0|This is by far my favorite Secret Garden CD and their only all instumental CD. I prefer the allegro selections , despite the fact that they consider them to be filler material . The musicianship is first rate and you would never know that the individual songs were recorded in pieces , unless you visited their website . This CD has , what the Grateful Dead refered to as , the X factor . Everything on each selection flows together as if all of the musicians were in the same studio doing it live . Fionnuala Sherry dominates the entire work as the featured artist , but certainly doesn't overpower the rest of the fine musicians involved . I find it remarkable that this CD has never received a major award .
B000IJ79WU|4.0|Hollywood is filled with stories about how movies were supposed to be...and then became something else.<br /><br />The Richard Donner cut of SUPERMAN II is a very rare chance to see what a movie was originally intended to be--or at least some approximation of what was intended.<br /><br />Richard Donner had been fired and Marlon Brando demanded more money (Brando was no stranger to this kind of turmoil since this was why he didn't appear in GODFATHER II either).  The Richard Lester version that was released in 1981 was more of a stand-alone comic book adventure with some of the original film left in.<br /><br />But the Donner version fits much better with the first film, developing the relationship between Clark Kent and Lois Lane as well as Superman with his father, Jor-El.<br /><br />Although some of the special effects look dated, and Christopher Reeves' hair goes from slicked down to blown dry in a single scene, this movie is definitely worth checking out to see what the filmmakers originally had in mind.  The final scenes may leave you scratching your head (a reviewer named Superman Fan has written an excellent review that asks some great questions: If Superman can safely have sex with a human woman, why would he need to give up his super powers?  If Lois says his secret is safe, then why does Superman go back in time--again--to erase her memory and keep the bad guys in the space mirror?  The whole time travel thing never worked in the first movie either!).<br /><br />Now...can they use the latest technology and other raw materials to make SUPERMAN III and IV worth watching...?
B000002UAX|5.0|After soaring to new heights with Rubber Soul, Revolver and Pepper, The Beatles journey stalled somewhat in late 1967 with Magical Mystery Tour. Between May and October the band recorded The Beatles (The White Album). As the release date, set for late November, 1968, approached, we fans waited with a certain degree of trepidation. There were rumours that the band was experiencing internal problems. Would this, together with the death of manager Brian Epstein and the disappointing trip to India, result in another record that would not quite live up to our lofty expectations?  The short answer is a resounding \\"NO!\\"<br /><br />Some have complained that The Beatles consists of music that is \\"all over the map\\". This is certainly the case. There are twenty-seven songs, spread over four LP sides. There are, essentially, four composers and four vocalists. I prefer to applaud the variety of style and sound rather than bemoan the lack of a consistent thread. I have never considered that this album sounds \\"thrown together\\" or \\"dysfunctional\\" as others have written. For me, The White Album competes with Soul, Revolver, Pepper and Abbey Road for honours as the best Beatles release. Only Revolution #9, which I have being trying to appreciate for almost forty years, and Ob-Le-Di, Ob-La-Da, detract from my enjoyment. George Harrison's Guitar Weeps and Long. Long, Long are stand-outs. Paul shows that he can still rock hard (USSR) and John that he can be a balladeer (Julia).<br /><br />The Beatles is a magnificent comeback - a stellar way for the band to begin the final stage of its career - and yet another record that earns its five stars with ease.
0385334206|5.0|I was a bookworm since I learned how to read books at 7. I read Vonnegut's \\"Breakfast of Champions\\" the first time when I was still a teen (in Polish translation) and this book was probably the most astonishing I ever read in my life. Funny (but also bitter), interesting, easy to read, even had some author pictures, sometimes strangely related to the text. But on the other hand, this book really make you think - about the world, about our civilization and where it is heading, about the people and their strange ways, about America.<br /><br />When I first read the book I was still in communistic Poland, so I saw some of the problems the author was talking about as a part of the western civilization. Now after I read it again, I see so much mild critique of excesses of America's life. I live in America ~ 10 years so it is normal that for me America would be always something different than my home country or Europe. I am amazed that Vonnegut still can look at America from the position of the external observer, who still can see some absurdity in many aspects of life.<br /><br />In spite of his critique of the world, country and society Vonnegut loves people, he loves them with all their weakness and defects. His books have great educational value.
B000002UB3|5.0|On February 11th, 1963 The Beatles entered the studio to record their first LP. After three sessions and nine hours they were done! Ten new songs had been laid down. Together with the A & B sides from their first two singles these songs comprised the album entitled Please Please Me. Exactly six years later they again entered the studio. This time it was to record their eleventh (official) and very last record. Abbey Road was completed six months later. How times had changed!<br /><br />The great NFL running back, Jim Brown, retired in July, 1966. He was just twenty-nine years old. During the 1965 season he scored seventeen touchdowns and was named the NFL's most valuable player. I mention Jimmy Brown because he is one of the very few athletes or artists to retire when at the peak of a career. Similarly, The Beatles recorded Abbey Road, perhaps their greatest LP, and then called it a day. The \\"official\\" announcement was not made for some months and another LP, recorded earlier, was later released. However, when the last member of the band left the studio after the last note of Road was done The Beatles, too, were done.<br /><br /> The Beatles were as a classic \\"pop\\" group rather than a rock band. Sure, they could sing ravers like Twist and Shout, Helter Skelter and USSR convincingly. However, they always balanced this type of material with equally appealing songs from other genres - R and B in the beginning, ballads, pure \\"pop\\" and then later songs incapable of definition - A Day in the Life, Strawberry Fields. For me The Beatles were always about balance. In the earlier LPs there was the balance between covers and original material. In the middle period the influence of Dylan and the Byrds became apparent. However, the band didn't become a folk-rock outfit. During 1966 and 1967 Eastern philosophy and music was introduced into their lives and music without overwhelming either. Sgt. Pepper introduced psychedelia without the album becoming a psychedelic record. Mid-way through the band's musical career John and Paul drifted apart in several ways. Notwithstanding their differences they still created magnificent records. Some tracks were clearly Lennon (Walrus, Warm Gun) and others McCartney (Bungalow Bill, Fool, Leaving Home). John seemed the dominant individual. Yet, right up to the very end, neither dominated the other to the detriment of the music itself. Abbey Road epitomizes this balance. Side one opens and closes with two strong Lennon pieces - Come Together and I Want You. George's contributions are perhaps the strongest songs on each side - Something and Here Comes the Sun. McCartney then closes the book on the band with the rest of side two. Although I was always a bigger fan of Lennon's contributions to the band I have to admit that side two is not only the perfect finale it is my favourite side of music on any record. Say the words \\"side two\\" to anyone who grew up during the sixties and he or she will unhesitatingly know what you are referring to. Enough said.<br /><br />And so the curtain comes down upon the greatest career in the history of popular music. The influence of the Beatles upon the music and culture of the time and that which followed cannot be over-estimated. Sure, the British invasion may have occurred anyway, with some other person or group at the helm. Some other \\"look\\" - the suits, the hair - would have emerged and dominated. Arena rock, music videos, artificial double tracking, feedback and sampling would have taken place. Psychedelic music might have developed. However, what may have happened \\"but for\\" the Beatles is a matter of pure conjecture. The simple fact is that we need not guess. In six short years The Beatles stood the world of music on its head. Almost forty years later their influence, remarkably, is still being felt.d-way through the band's musical career John and Paul drifted apart in several ways.

B000N6U0E2|2.0|the film and the extra scenes fail to make mention of what became of the son?  Did he finish college? Is he happily living with a family of his own?  Does he work for his dad, or what?  <br /> <br />He was a central figure afterall.  I didn't read the book, and maybe this has been addressed by someone in the other review postings, but I find it odd that the real son was left out of the ending.  This movie would not have been made if it did not have the son figure.  Did he not want to participate and why?  I fear that maybe he and his dad had a falling out.  That would be incredibly tragic and put a damper on the story.   <br /> <br />As for the movie, my lower than average rating is because I found the movie to be sooo depressing.  A good drama builds to a climax where the action requires a \\"drop-dead\\" event, decision or encounter, then a resolution.  Here, 90 percent of the movie was at a climax stage.  It was one horror after another.  Okay, maybe that was the real life, but I needed a break-a few actually.  My wife and I agreed that we were glad to have not seen this at the theater as it would have been too draining.  Also, the resolution was nice-although expected-but, the movie almost immediately ends.  It could have been done better.
B000LXHK2C|3.0|Russell Crowe plays an ambitious British stockbroker who gets his highs from making clever moves on the stock exchange, regardless of what effect his actions have on other people.  He inherits his uncle's estate and winery in France and goes there in order to prepare it for sale.  Instead his return brings back memories of happy times spent with his uncle and a reacqauintance with a kinder, gentler way of life.  The scenery is breathtaking, the acting is good and the premise is interesting, but some parts of the movie were hard to understand.  There is a question about the quality of the wine produced in Crowe's inherited estate, and whether it was the screenplay, the actors' accents or a confusing script, we were not always sure as to where the plot was turning and what was happening.  The best things about the movie were Russell Crowe and the beautiful scenery.

B00026WU7I|5.0|Even a cursed eighties born child of the disposible Killers-generation like me can appreciate the genius behind 'Blood on the tracks' In contrast to the commonplace acts of today, Dylans music has always sustained staying power and relevance and this record is still a great illustration of his amazing talent many years after its release. This is an important and poetic record which deals with real emotions (turning a failed marriage into a force for good) and contains some of his most eternal songs (such as 'Idiot wind' and 'Shelter from the storm') The virtuosity displayed on 'Blood' is rare and special. I would recommend this album to anyone. <br />

B000MXPE7O|3.0|This film is a not very successful attempt at combining a Cold War spy thriller with psychological realism.  A loosely fictionalized account of events in the history of the CIA and based probably on the life of James Angleton, the long time and controversial head of CIA counter-intelligence.  The Bay of Pigs fiasco, the CIA sponsored coup against the Arbenz regime in Guatemala, and the Kim Philby disaster are among the events used in the plot.  The movie shows the genesis of the CIA in the WWII OSS and its staffing from the heart of the American establishment with the role of the Yale secret society Skull and Bones featured prominently.  These episodes are fairly well done but not sufficiently well to give this film a truly historic quality.<br /><br />As a thriller, this film is a failure.  It is not particularly suspenseful, partly because the outcome of events is clearly known.  The characters, however, are not engaging enough to elicit sympathy.  Matt Damon's performance might be described as wooden, though the script doesn't give him much to work with.  The film's attempts at giving the Damon character some psychological depth through events of his childhood is a bit too pat to be convincing.<br /><br />A key plot device is a piece of audiotape that gives clues to the betrayal of the Bay of Pigs invasion.  This unclear tape reveals information that is unexpected by and provokes a crisis for the Damon character.  Movie-goers with good memories will recognize this as the key plot device of Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation, a very good film made about 30 years ago.  As Coppola is one of the producers of this film, its likely this is a conscious piece of derivation.<br /><br />Derivative, unhistorical, and lacking suspense is a bad combination.

0151013047|5.0|I went to a book signing for this novel the other night and was surprised to hear Mohsin Hamid's method for writing. He said that he wrote over 1000 pages to come up with this 184 page novel. The thing was, he didn't whittle it down from 1000 pages in length, it was that he re-wrote the premise in several different drafts without re-using the previously written text.<br /><br />He said it wasn't an efficient method, but one that ultimately worked for him.<br /><br />The structure of the story is different from most novels in that it is a monologue of one character speaking to another. The reader has to fill in the gaps, and wonder what the motivation is for the American man who winds up listening to this Pakistani man's life story.<br /><br />There is tension that builds in the story, and Changez the narrator uses politeness as a method to manipulate others.<br /><br />The style is clean, and it is easy to be drawn into the story and read in a single sitting if time permits. I recommend it highly.
B00006CXSS|5.0|It is hard to find words to describe the 700 minute, 10 part epic that is \\"Band of Brothers\\". Following Easy Company of the US Airborne through traing, D-Day parachute landings and onto Germany, the series is a wonderfully made depiction of the events of war as the men of Easy experienced it.<br /><br />The series combines the filmed parts with initial interview footage of surviving members making comments related to themes in that particular part. One part, with Albert Blythe, a scared soldier, is preceded by the interview footage discussing fear and dealing with it. These excerpts leant a great deal to the overall message of the films. Each part has an overall theme that is dealt with, such as replacements and so on.<br /><br />The execution and making of the parts was excellent throughout. The combat scenes are filmed with cameras bobbing about, as if the cameraman is running right behind the soldiers in combat. The choice makes these scenes all the more realistic.<br /><br />This is not a glossed over war movie, and the scenes are graphic and what the men did may not always inspire sympathy. However flawed the men were, the depiction is honest and real, and one still admires them their bravery, humour and loyalty to each other in adversity. A particularly moving part is when \\"Bull\\" Randall's men go back to a German occuppied village to find him after Easy had retreated from it. Luckily, he had already been found after the Germans had left.<br /><br />The special features are extensive, and add even more information to the making of the series and the men who inspired it.<br /><br />Overall, this is without doubt an excellent series on the invasions of Europe by the Allies during World War Two. It seems long, but I have sat through it many times and still enjoy it heaps. I always seem to end it with something new from it. It is definitely worth seeing more than once.
B000KX0IOK|4.0|When police officers watch movies about cops, they often snort in derision about how unrealistically their jobs are portrayed. So as a middle school teacher who has worked the mean streets -- er, hallways, for many years, I had a hard time letting go of my desire to yell \\"Fake!\\" while watching HALF-NELSON.<br /><br />Not that this is a bad film; in fact, it's a deeply intelligent movie that features lovely acting. (I know Gosling got an Oscar nomination out of it, but it was Shareeka Epps playing Drey who steals a lot of scenes.) The film was also unexpectedly funny, with any number of subtly wrought ironic turnarounds.<br /><br />But since I'm here to split hairs, here's a couple of cavils. Short of someone slipping Seconal into the school's water supply, the middle schoolers in Dan Dunne's class were unbelievably mellow. (I know, part of the motif of the film is how mature the students are compared to their teacher, but c'mon.) Further, after Dunne throws the basketball at a referee, he smokes crack in the bathroom. In fact, he would have had to smoke his crack elsewhere, as 99% of the schools in the country would have had him escorted from the building (and probably fired) for throwing the ball in the first place. Okay, I'll stop; I might give you the impression I didn't like this movie, when I appreciated it greatly.<br /><br />Also recommended: Maggie Gyllenhaal in the remarkable [[ASIN:B000JBXXYK Sherrybaby]].
B000000OPZ|5.0|First there was Deep Purple's \\"The House of Blue Light\\" from January 1987, and then, \\"Whitesnake\\" [the album] from March 1987. Whitesnake's turned out to be the more popular album, maybe the most popular album of the year because of it's commercial appeal, and the music videos that helped to sell it, but make no mistake it's a really good album. But Deep Purple's was even better in my opinion, a far less commercial rock album who's videos were unfortunately banned by MTV, which helped keep it out of the Billboard top 20.<br /><br />Finally, I'm so tired of reading about the Whitesnake songs from this album being Led Zeppelin rip offs. Coverdale has already confirmed that a lot of the riffs come from Deep Purple rehearsal tapes back in the mid seventies when Coverdale was their lead singer. These riffs are \\"borrowed\\" from Ritchie Blackmore, not Jimmy Page. Case closed!<br /><br />I advise getting both of these great rock albums of 1987:<br />*Whitesnake - Whitesnake<br />*Deep Purple - The House of Blue Light
B000J3EEBY|5.0|I read about people talking about Loreena McKennitt as if she were like Enya.  McKennitt was born in Canada of Irish and Scottish, hence the connection some people make with Enya, and the fact that some of her earlier material has a very distinct Celtic sound. However, in my mind Loreena McKennitt has always stayed at a safe distance from a mainstream sound (a little more common in Enya's work), and this album is another confirmation of that.<br /><br />After a ten year absence from the studio, McKennitt came back in 2006 with an album inspired by her trips through many Asian and Mediterranean lands. Her musical caravan in \\"An Ancient Muse\\" comes with a sound that often reminds of the Middle East. The end result of the album brings her closer to the likes of Dead Can Dance and further from her traditional Celtic sound. Still, this is an album that is bound to rejoice her fans, who will be happy with the well-rounded and balanced nine tracks on it.
B00005JLWN|1.0|OK - in the best interests of all concerned, for this review I've decided to take a different approach.  I mean, sure - I could easily rip this movie to shreds with my own words (and have a lot of fun doing so), but in the end you might not really trust my perspective and then you might end up actually seeing this film.<br /><br />Since I don't want that fate to befall you (or anyone else on this planet), I thought it might be more persuasive to instead use the words of this movie's director, taken directly from his commentary track.  After all, who would know better about the merits (or lack thereof) of this particular cinematic offering?  So, without further adieu, allow me to present Kurt Wimmer's very own remarks to describe this thing he has made:<br /><br />\\"Do I actually have the b@!!s to hang the movie on this concept, which may fail?  And it did fail.  The movie itself failed.\\"<br /><br />\\"Critics laughed at this scene, and for the life of me I don't know why.\\"<br /><br />\\"I failed to a large degree in this scene; it doesn't have the power or resonance that it could have or it should have.\\"<br /><br />\\"I have no idea how I could have made it better - I just think I sort of reached the limits of my filmmaking ability.\\"<br /><br />\\"In this scene, I had an idea that actually worked for once.\\"<br /><br />\\"I basically ran out of time, as usual...\\"<br /><br />The second editor on this film (who had never cut a film before) was \\"one of the few people who was actually an advocate of this film while we were shooting and was optimistic about what this film could be\\" (the first editor asked if he could leave, by the way)<br /><br />\\"Here's an example of creative bankruptcy at its best: I just couldn't decide what he should be wearing...so I put this decision off...until basically the day of and ended up sticking him in a plaid shirt, which looks kind of silly I think.\\"<br /><br />\\"It's interesting how sterile these split dioptre shots were.  I really, really don't like them.  I was just dying to do one of my own, and I doubt I will ever do them again.\\"<br /><br />\\"The composition has clearly fallen apart - that's what happened to me here.\\"<br /><br />\\"When I watch these fight scenes, I kind of cringe a bit because I know we could have done them so much better\\"<br /><br />This scene is \\"a moment of slightly flawed comedy which doesn't really work.  I've concluded I'm not good at it and I'll just stick with the action.\\"<br /><br />\\"In the final analysis, this film was eviscerated by the critics.  It was really vilified, and I don't fully understand it.\\"<br /><br />Um.  Kurt.  So as to aid in your understanding of the critics' vilification, might I refer you to your own commentary?

B000M4RG42|4.0|War and symbols of war have endured in the public consciousness ever since human beings began to throw stones at each other in the Paleolithic. The brutality that is war is horrific enough but when distorted images of that war begin to percolate in the minds of those who have not participated in that war, then the result is to recreate a false reality that brings shame to those who died so that we today can wonder what is true and what is not.  In FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS, director Clint Eastwood exposes one of the lingering myths of image corruption: the symbiotic relation between the need of the home population to create and revel in heroes who urge us to fight when common sense says not to and the heroes themselves who are called heroes but wonder why that is so.<br /><br />During the last few months of the war in the Pacific, the battle to defeat Japan was going well in a military sense, but not well in a financial sense.  Unless America became willing to dig deeply into its collective pockets to buy bonds to finance the war, then the warfare itself might grind to an ignominious halt.  Eastwood saw the raising of the American flag atop Mt. Suribachi as a two level symbol, of which the first level was plainly proclaimed by all concerned in 1945--that is that American power was invincible and inexorable.  The bulk of FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS, however, digs deeply into the subtext of that symbol to suggest that it is not enough for any culture to identify and elevate a soldier myth that will invigorate that nation's will to win.  In the sad tale of the three Americans who raised the flag but did not see themselves as worthy of all that hoopla, Eastwood implies that for a nation to be truly worthy of greatness, the heroes themselves must not be afflicted with self-loathing such that the result will be harmful to the war effort. The case of Ira Hayes, the native American who fought harder to stay out of the glare of publicity than he did to stay out of the way of Japanese bullets clearly shows the tragic consequences of elevating unwilling heroes to the pantheon of self-enlightened heroes.  As soon as that first photo (or second photo) was taken, it should have occurred to the Financial Powers That Be that these three American soldiers might not be able to survive climbing the paper-mache Mr. Suribachi any more successfully than their less fortunate mates were in slogging their way up on the real one.  In FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS, Eastwood skillfully depicts that the relation between our need to create heroes and the need of those very heroes to want to be needed is very tricky indeed, and we who see this film and those like it need to ask ourselves a series of troubling questions that bothered Ira Hayes even as he leaned into that iron pipe on that mountain top on Iwo Jima.bullets clearly shows the tragic consequences of elevating unwilling heroes to the pantheon of self-enlightened heroes.

B000JJSRNY|5.0|These concerts with excerpts from the great opera compositions make for a fun , light evening of great music. My whole generation, somehow, grew up thinking that opera was \\"square\\". The sad thing is my generation is now, practically, culturally underpriveledged, like so many peasants from vast, barren desert lands.  Some of the most gorgeous music ever written was produced by the likes of Rossini, Puccini, et. al. during a time when classical painting was also achieving the highest levels of expertise ever in the entire history of man. Why should this music be systematically passed over then? It should not. Thanks to the tireless efforts of the greatest tenor in the past generation, our beloved \\"Iron Man of Opera\\", Placido Domingo - who also happens to be the most genuinely likeable person on any stage, this great music IS being brought center stage; and is gaining popularity by leaps and bounds.<br /><br />  The new kids on the block, Anna Netrebko, and Rolando Villazon do shine nicely in this extravaganza. They bring a wonderful , and spontaneous joy to the works. Exactly what the doctor ordered. Yet it is interesting to \\"shop and compare\\" these artists, and their unique personal styles they bring to the stage..especially when compared to the inimitable maestro, Sr. Domingo. One would think, \\"Oh..65...old, shot, worn out, poor thing\\"....well,that's what you get for thinking! Au Contrare, mon frer. Just for fun, select Italian subtitles, and listen carefully who sings Italian correctly! Although Rolando ought to be able to do a good job with Italian, he falls well short of the mark.( Albeit he does do a very Italian job of Rossini's \\" La Danza\\" - close coaching from Placido perhaps?) Rolando's arrows sort of land all over the straw bull's eye...then listen to Placido doing a duet with him and see for yourself how he nails it- Placido's are perfect bull's eyes- every syllable, every note...and much, much more than that....the expression, the 'spinto' it is called; the many subtle nuances of timbre and emotive expression that causes the composition to soar, and majestically so. Once again, we all get a free lesson in how to sing by the greatest tenor of our age. Anna also pronounces the Italian \\"e\\" as a short \\"i\\", rather than \\"eh\\" as it should. But that is a small thing compared to the brightness and sweetness she brings to all of her beautifully done pieces. This DVD is worth the price if you selected only the Domingo tracks alone! I adjure you all not to miss this one. There are five encores, each one more tumultous and joyous than the last.  Also,it is wonderful to see an audience so animated. So often the audience makes you want to ask, \\"Are you an audience or an oil painting?\\" Thank you, Placido for helping us all to understand and to appreciate this great music...for getting an audience on its feet. Also I would be remiss if I did not praise the orchestra and its young conductor...absolute shining brightness.ny subtle nuances of timbre and emotive expression that causes the composition to soar, and majestically so.

B0000AMRJD|5.0|Still awesome after what, 100 plus times viewing? This film was panned by virtually all of the critics and has yet remained a classic for nearly 25 years! Pacino is simply brilliant, the casting is superb and even the tawdry photography and music (at times) is delicious. The critics never could quite get over the controversial chainsaw scene and the 160 some odd uses of the \\"F word\\" and therefore slammed the movie as a whole. But in doing so, they missed what millions of others haven't: a great film with great acting and pacing. If you haven't already, see for yourself whether the violence and language is obscene and over-the-top, or whether it fits the movie nearly perfectly in its context. Oh, and Michelle Pfeiffer is hot..
0517543052|5.0|When I first read this book in 1971, it was the bible of the new age movement. It synthesized just about everything .It was psychology, philosophy, poetry, religion, mysticism, and was non-dogmatic. It was inclusive. Spiritual jazz at its finest. When I read it again 30 years later, like a classic, it still held up. \\"Be here now\\" is not just a simplistic platitude, it is pure cosmic wisdom. Just about every recent book on happiness emphasizes the importance of embracing the moment. You don't find happiness in the past or the future. This is not some kind of a faddish pop culture, hippie leftover thing. This book has endured as a best seller for a good reason. It's applicable any time and any place. Wherever you go, you're 'here'. Whenever you go, it's 'now'. Read this book.
B000NA28I4|1.0|What a disappointment. This film barely skims the book. The characters are all underdeveloped. The dragon isn't even interesting. What a shame. This could have been a block buster of a film, instead, It's flat and just plain boring. The wonderful imagery of the book is completely missing.Parts of the film make no sense.Anyone who has not read the book will be totally lost.Those who have read it will be disgusted. A fifth grader could  have written a better script!  <br />Ed Speleers is pretty good as Eragon. He might well have given a good performance if the script hadn't been such a stinker. <br />The music, which should enhance a film, only annoys here. It is dull, lacking in subtlety and nuance, and intrudes  at odd moments. It tries to be noble and heroic, but it comes off as silly and lacking in depth. It sounds like a high school music student composed it....one who was failing band!  <br />Christopher Paolini can not possibly be pleased with this mess. Chris, go talk to Stephen King; he can tell you what Hollywood does to good books.  <br />It's a shame this didn't land in Peter Jackson's hands. This review might have been much different if it had.

B000MXPE7O|5.0|Wow.  This is one strong movie.  If you are seeking a traditional action-adventure film, look elsewhere; this film is cerebral and not brain candy.  It is a mostly fictionalized story of the formation of the CIA, from its distant relative the OSS during WWII, to more recent times.  The story revolves around Edward Wilson (played perfectly by Matt Damon) as a privileged Yale graduate that is drawn into the counter-espionage \\"business\\".  I must take exception to the comment by the Amazon.com reviewer when he states: \\"Viewers have to wonder why anyone, much less someone like Wilson who has everything going for him, would devote his life to a thankless job that brings so little happiness to himself and his family.\\"  Such a comment reflects on the reviewers failure to perceive Wilson for what he is, a committed individual with a strong sense of duty.  Wilson sees himself \\"called to duty\\" much, it appears, as did his father.  He places the interests of his country above his own needs and that of his family.  While you can argue the merits and dangers of nationalism, there certainly are such men and Wilson is clearly one.  I think this is a superb film, not perfect, but still superb.  It provides a fascinating window into the birth of the CIA and the struggles of the men that lived the experience.  It is a film you will watch many times.

B000059T1E|5.0|I was there when my older sisters listened to the vinyl version of Barleycorn on the turntable, back when the LP was only recently released. Even with the scratches and pops, the unique jazzy progressive flow of the music was immaculate.  Needless to say, the re-mastering of what is already a true master may be redundant or gratuitious, but go ahead--make my day...stretch the limits of the human capacity to experience bliss.  The other Amazon reviewers of this legendary work of art do not lie, are not using hyperbole, and do not exaggerate the point...this one goes to eleven...er, six...er, whatever.
B000002KKS|5.0|What can I say?  After decades of listening to rock-n-roll music...after purchasing hundreds of albums...after memorizing thousands of songs...there's one solitary album that I can put at the top of the list, and that album is \\"Heaven and Hell\\" by Black Sabbath. <br /> <br />Quite simply, this is the best album I've ever heard...my personal favorite.  From the first time I ever heard it, this was the best.  Check it out.
B000MXPE7O|3.0|Robert DeNiro has an obvious affection for the existential spy drama, ala John Le Carre or Len Deighton.  Ronin, which he coproduced was a respectable entry into the field until director Frankenheimer succumbed to filming the ultimate urban car chase.  The Good Shepherd attempts to cram a whole shelf of spy novels into a single narrative. The thin plot defies logic.  Why Matt Damon's character who has no character is entrusted with so much is implausible.  Why his spy character isn't lying at the bottom of the Thames with Michael Gambon's is a mystery.  And no one seems to age in this movie except Alec Baldwin and Matt Damon's son.  Thirty or forty years pass and everyone looks the same.  Just another day at the CIA. This movie is a mess!
0151013047|2.0|I had read Hamid's first novel and liked very much. This novel is a disappointment in comparison. The novel deals with an important topic, but it is neither well-written nor very insightful. In fact, Mr. Hamid's account does not come across as having much cultural understanding of his native Pakistan. It is a pitty that Mr. Hamid has not lived up the promise that his first novel held. If you are looking for a good read this is not it.
B000002OTL|4.0|I can't say anything about this soundtrack that hasn't been said a hundred times.  The known songs are great and the surf songs are better.  I just wonder why Tarantino didn't include Link Wray's \\"Rumble\\" that is played in the background during the Jack Rabbit Slims scene.  It is such a great song, it would have put this soundtrack over the edge.

Many of my books are in the fields of spirituality, psychology, therapy, creativity, etc. I say this to provide context to my comment on this book, which is that it is by far one of the most significant books I have read in the past 20 years. Tolle's book is clear, approachable, persuasive and powerful. It has definitely impacted and contributed to my thinking about life. I am buying copies for my adult children.

B000024L5R|5.0|Order was fast, disc was in excellent shape, very nice music.
B000O178BY|5.0|I bought Pretty Hate Machine when it came out and I allways felt that at least for the power of his singing, Trent Resnor never quite a chieved anything as good. Nopw I know that some of the later albums are harder buut soemthing was lacking. Here, he has managed to combine the harder sound with his previous pop edge. Indeed, besides being quite heavy on distortion and noise, there are actually even some tunes! It starts off brilliantly with the instrumental tour de force HYPERPOWER! It is clearly better than his previous efforts and is really recommended. On the other hand if you take heavy industrial techno, it follows a model and does sometimes lack in originality. A group such as Numb did this way before the first NIN album, but...It is still great for those who like this kind of stuff.
0618680004|5.0|God god god god god god god god.  God this.  God that.  Ohhh...doesn't it make you think people just say \\"god\\" to hear the word and convince themselves there ACTUALLY is something like that in the universe?    Listen, the absence of evidence against something doesn't necessitate its existence automatically.  Religious individuals don't seem to understand this very simple fact.  They argue that since we humans can't possibly deny the existence of a higher being we can't rule out it exists.  Umm...sure we can.    For a brief moment let us all just set aside our biases and concentrate on the hard science of probability.    First of all, ANYTHING is possible.  But not everything is PROBABLE.  It's POSSIBLE I could tomorrow grow wings and not have to pay Southwest $[...] for one bag of honey-glazed peanuts.  Or, maybe, I could suddenly discover a billion dollars under my mattress and buy Apple stock and get my hands on the newest gadget before all you schmucks.  But it ain't gonna happen.  The probability of any such fantastic thing happening is terribly low.    You see, probability relies on past occurrances, current trends, and then makes an educated (but accurate) guess as to future events.  No, it's not perfect, but it does indeed work.  I can't grow wings tomorrow because I haven't been able to since my birth, under varying environmental conditions; I won't find money under my mattress because it hasn't happened before and I don't earn enough to have anywhere remotely close to a billion dollars saved up...crap.    Same thing with this whole god nonsense.  Supposedly, according to Christian and Western religious dogma, the world is only a handful of thousands of years old, but in this short amount of time no god has made his or her matter of existence a fact.  That is, the Christian god has failed to present himself beyond the mystic world, beyond the shrowd of secrecy and darkness.  In all this time no god has come forward to persuade us of his power.  People don'twake up in the morning KNOWING there is a god.  People wake up HOPING there is a god.  That's a huge differene.    Faith is hope, pure and simple.  Someone who has \\"faith\\" is hoping for something.  Faith in a god is hoping said god is really out there listening to your problems.  Faith in a religion is hoping said religion can truly begin to answer your life questions.  But faith is not scientific, nor is it accurate.  Faith is guessing without precedent, without facts, without probability.  Faith is taking absurd notions and fantasizing them in the real world.    There's nothing necessarily wrong with faith, but too much of it blinds us.  That's what Richard Dawkins is trying to convey in this book.  Fanatical faith leads to fanatical beliefs and fanatical actions.  What difference is there really between a Muslim terrorist and a Christian fundamentalist?  Hardly any.  You see, in both cases the individuals want the destruction of the world.  The terrorist envisions forty virgins after blowing himself up in a hotel lobby, whereas the Christian looks forward to some world war that will usher the End Times and eventually bring back Christ.    What rubbish.  Is this what we want our children to learn--to demand the destruction of the world?  Now, are all Christians or Muslims bad?  No, of course not.  But all religious peoples (ALL religious people) are inherently dangerous in that they blind themselves from facts.  Take into account the current debates about the creation of the universe, abortion, and even global warming.  There is substantial evidence suggesting (to a very high degree of probability) that the universe was created from a single point in space smaller than the tip of a pencil, that a fetus truly is the property of the mother, and that temperatures are radically changing around the world and causing population displacements and even species extinctions.    But, being religious, individuals can ignore the facts.  They can turn a blind eye to astrophysics when it tells them that star dating does indeed factually tell us that the universe is BILLIONS of years old (roughly 14 billion years old), that since light travels at a fixed speed the light from a star ten million light years away takes ten million years to reach earth, in turn suggesting that star has been around for at least ten million years.  Religious dogma teaches to frown upon a woman's right to choose; it violently demands all pregnant women give birth, regardless of the facts: that a woman may not be capable or willing to care for the child, or that the child may have a very painful physical or mental impairment.  Where would these children end up if not foster homes or in garbage dumpsters?  Is that really a better alternative than aborting a non-living fetus in its early stages?  And global warming...well, let's not even mention that term if you're a Christian fanatic!  Global climate facts are inconclusive to these people.    This is the type of danger Dawkins is talking about.  Christian children learn their values from their Christian families and friends and schools.  Their radical views are getting more radical every generation, or are at least failing to lose grip.  Let us not forget the horrible wars taken up in the name of god or genocides committed against the unclean, ungodly.    Yes, Dawkins indeed comes across harsh but for good reason.  Even his contemporaries chide him for his tone, but miss the point.  You can't gently speak to delinquint children such as religious diehards.  Stern tones are called for and Mr. Dawkins should be applauded for his courage and straightforwardness.  His book is insightful and compelling.  And though he doesn't cover all the vast arguments against religion, he certainly makes a strong case and a concrete foundation upon which to build further.
0671799320|4.0|This is an excellent book on the role of oil in the world economy. What makes it better than many other books is that it has a truely global view of the oil industry throughout its long history.  Its also not written for experts. Its a very accessable book.  <br /> <br />Yergin shows how America dominated the world of oil in the first half of the 20th century and how managed its decline in the second half of that century. He shows that the basic problems of the oil industry (overproduction, underproduction and voliatile prices) have consistantly repeated since the beginnings of the industry.  <br /> <br />If there is a flaw, its that Yergin doesn't give enough coverage to the oil industry in Africa and its role in the global oil trade. It gets occasional mentions, but not the comprehensive coverage the middle east gets. The same comments apply to an extent to south america. He could have also done a better job in explaining how oil money tends to distort economies from Alaska to Norway to Saudi Arabia in the same general ways. <br /> <br />The final chapter of the book is dated and some of its speculation about the future didn't hold up very well. But if the reader wants an introduction into the history of the global oil business and how it affects the countries involved, this is a useful book.
B000000HHE|5.0|You know the typical gangsta/hardcore listener? A 15-year-old white boy from the 'burbs who wants to be a man but his mom won't let him have a really loud car? The kind who writes reviews like \\"u got 2 get dis its da shiz\\"? They'll hate this album. <br /> <br />Now, you know the musically adventurous, intelligent listener who avoids rap because they think it's all gangsta/hardcore? The kind of sentient being who can handle the concept of chords and knows the difference between *your* and *you're*? This is the person you should buy this album for. <br /> <br />Even if you don't think you'll like rap, this is an album worth checking out. It's not the stereotypical inmate-screaming-over-a-background-of-falling-skillets [c]rap everyone's sick of. This is smooth, clever, funny, creative spoken-word music. That's the key; it's *musical.* There are breezy melodic hooks under witty, deft vocals with just enough punch to be classed as rap. <br /> <br />Sure, it's Old School, but Old School's never gotten old, while a lot of the other genres have become derivative, repetitive, and stale. You'll like this CD from the beginning, and you'll keep listening to it, because it's inventive and creative. Whether you're new to rap or a fan looking for something new and interesting, this is a great buy.
B00008DDHZ|4.0|The director of Flight 93 shows his talent is no fluke with this mesmerizing retelling of this horrific peace march.
B000002UZU|5.0|As much as I love the 1989-1997 albums that closed out John Lee's amazing career (Healer, Mr. Lucky, Boom Boom, Chill Out, Don't Look Back), 1970's Hooker 'n Heat is a true crown jewel in the legacy. Just as Johnny Winter's pure sympatico hand of support guided Muddy Waters through his late-career Blue Sky albums, Canned Heat provides the most solid and driven backing I've heard on a JLH album. John Lee is in full-blown Crawling King Snake mode here...on this album he's not a kindly \\"elder statesman,\\" he's a dangerous man, and if you approach his flame, you WILL get burned. The late Heat vocalist Bob \\"The Bear\\" Hite limits himself to co-producer duties here, so the musical dynamics come from Al \\"Blind Owl\\" Wilson (his final recording), guitarist Henry \\"Sunflower\\" Vestine (get ready for the thoroughly insane 11 minute \\"Boogie Chillen No. 2\\"), Antonio de la Barreda on bass and Fito de la Parra on drums. The first 9 tracks are John Lee solo. Wilson joins tracks 10 and 11, and the full band backs the remaining 6 tracks.  Make no mistake about it...you WILL get cold chills when Hooker bellows \\"Alan! Alan! Blow your HORN, baby!\\" on \\"Let's Make It.\\"
B000002KFJ|5.0|There are a few things I gotta say about Sabotage, Black Sabbath's sixth album: First, it's one of my favorites.  Probably my favorite over Paranoid just because I've heard Paranoid way too many times in my life. Secondly, that this is the decline of Sabbath.  No doubts about that.  If you think differently and are a huge fan of Technical Ecstasy, well... you're insane!  This was the last time that Sabbah were all on the same page.  Sure there are little bits and pieces of greatness after Sabotage, but very little.  Sabotage is a grand and glorious rock epic!  This is probably the only album that Sabbath put out that flowed perfectly!  Where they started to experiment on Vol. 4 and Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath, Sabotage is the culmination of all that.  Whoa!  Taking a two-year hiatus from touring and recording will do that to you.  Everything falls into place.  Also, what a great album cover.  Ozzy wearing a dress and those really cool giant-heeled suede Elton John boots.  Bill Ward in his red spandex pants with his checkered underwear showing through.  Geezer with a cane.  The 70s!  Wow!<br /><br />Hole In The Sky - Great song!  I'm looking through a hole in the sky, I'm seeing nowhere through the eyes of a lie....  Great lyrics  Great riffs.  The productin value was probably Sabbath's best.  Rocking!<br /><br />Don't Start (Too Late)  - Iommi finally did it, he made his little instrumental show-off pieces fit into the rest of the album without throwing it for a loop! Cool little 50 second accoustic blurb that heads right into one of Sabbath last classic cuts.<br /><br />Symptom Of The Universe - All out metal goodness! This is one is one of those signaure Sabbath tunes that you will alway remember.  Yeaaaaaahhhh!<br /><br />Megalomania - Sprawling!  That's is what this song is:  sprawling!  What a killer epic tune!  This song is haunting.  One of my personal favorites!  Moody and dark and whoa!  I love this song!  The ghost of violence was something I'd seen.  I sold my soul to be the human obscene.... Great!<br /><br />The Thrill Of It All - Another personal favorite.  The lyrical content on Sabotage grew to maturity seemingly overnight.  Since Geezer wrote most of the lyrics I'm not sure you can blame Ozzy for most of the juvenile, hilarious lyrics of the past Sabbath albums, but these songs are definitely better written.  Perhaps Ozzy was lending a hand? Can I ask the final question if the answer could be sold?  Perfect.<br /><br />Superzar - Sprawling instumental with moaning chior in the background. This is epic.  No doubt about that. Are we in some dank, creepy monastery?  Sounds like it.  This is mood music for a human sacrifice. Beautiful.  Cohesive to the rest of the album.<br /><br />Am I Going Insane (Radio) - Pobably the most recognized song off the album becaus of it's induction onto the greatest hits collection  We Sold Our Soul For Rock'N'Roll. Great song.  Sabbath really clicked for the last time on this album.<br /><br />The Writ - Apparently Black Sabbath as an entity were having a lot of legal problems at this time and Ozzy said once that they couldn't go onstage without getting served with a writ or a restraining order or whatever.  Thus the birth of this lengthy album ender.  Killer tune.  Epic along the lines of the rest of the album.  Fits perfectly into the Sabotage lineup.<br /><br />Overall, Sabotage is the most consistent album Sabbath ever came out with.  All the songs mesh into a whole and that was very hard for Sabbath accomplish over the years. The fact that they tok a two-year break before recording Sabotage suggests that they needed to be away from each other to come back and make some good music. If Paranoid is their landmark album, then Sabotage is their perfect album.  What goes wrong after this is warring egos and drug-addiction and the end of Black Sabbath.  Sorry.  All good things must eventually come to an end.<br /><br />Dig it!.. Great!    The Thrill Of It All - Another personal favorite.

1845761502|5.0|The book is amazing and inspiring. And to answer NickNack: I happen to be a  CG artist and I can assure you that it DOES take a REAL artist to create awesome detailed CG characters, and it's way harder than sculpting by hand, but much more efficient from production's point of view. Computers do NOT create and animate characters by themselves, but they are a great tool for REAL artists. <br /> <br />A CG artist such as myself, beginner or professional, can find this book to be a great source of inspiration and reference for work.
B000002KET|4.0|Although their sucess was gettig to them & and their egos were starting to rise & their managers were stealing millions from them & feeding them all the booze and cocaine and groupies they could handle, Black Sabbath managed to overcome all that and come out with a killer fifth album. Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath is Sabbath matured. Produced by themselves, this is the begining of the end for the Sabs, but it sounds excellent.  There are a few fallbacks, of course, but Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath is cohesive and moody and just plain Bloody good Sabbath.<br /><br />Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath - Classic title track.  Ozzy belts out the pissed-at-you lyrics with bravado and angst.  Great riff.  Geezer pounds you with the bass line.  Awesome!!!!<br /><br />A National Acrobat - One of my personal favorites and somewhat overlooked.  Metallica did a cover of Sabra Cadabra an slipped in a chunk of this song and it was killer!  Grand and glorious!  Gets a little weird towards the end, but it, like much of Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath, is epic.  Genius!  You have to let your body sleep to let your soul live on...Yeah!<br /><br />Fluff - Yet another ponderous Iommi instrumental.  Laguna Sunrise is where he should have stopped with this kinda thing.  Set in between the rocking A National Acrobat and Sabra Cadabra, this song stumbles the entire flow of the album.  Enough of Iommi trying to show off.  This song sounds so forced, it's almost as if he's learning how to play it right there in the recording studio.  Boring!<br /><br />Sabra Cadabra - One of the coolest Iommi riffs of all time. This song kicks out the jams. One of the best songs Black Sabbath had to offer, ever.  Often overlooked.<br /><br />Killing Yourself To Live - As with most albums (being two-sided, remember that?) they put most of the killer stuff on side one so you didn't have to get up from smoking hot, tasty bong-loads to flip the album over. Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath falls into that category, but not in the good/bad sense.  On Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath it's more of a straight-forward/experimental duel.  Side one is straight-ahead Sabbath.  Side two is epic Sabbath expanding their sound.  The result isn't bad at all.  This song is sweeping and grand.  I particulrly like the part where Ozzy whispers Smoke It!  Get High!  Hilarious.<br /><br />Who Are You? - Sabbath with Synths.  Wowzer!  This is a weird, dragging, synth-heavy sci-fi tune about Big Brother.  Effective in places.  As a whole, not one of my favorite tacks.  Gets very swelling and grandiose.  Not really a Black Sabbath song.  Ozzy's voice grates here. Very 70s  Could've  had the 5th Dimension singing backup for them.<br /><br />Looking For Today  - Lighter Sabbath.  Grooving.  The only problem here is that it doesn't realy have a hook, so it's to easily misplaced.  Sounds like 60s Sabbath, Sabbath meets Herman's Hermits. Poppy!<br /><br />Spiral Architect - With the second side of Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath I think that Sabath was trying to get into the whole rock opera genre. Each song is multi-layered with strings and flutes and keyboards.  Very orchestrated. This would continue into Sabotage where the songs woud get even grander, more large-scale.  Spiral Archtect is layer upon layer of swelling grandeur.  Accoustic Iommi.  Violins.  Very elegant  Just a little far from the Sabbath way. Leave the rock operas to The Who.<br /><br />Overall, Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath is one of the better Sabbath albums.  If you're really into the power-crunch sludge of Sabbath, you may be disappointed here because they are moving away from that simplicity.  They are becoming master-craftsmen. They are geting too big for their britches.  Oh yeah!<br /><br />Dig it!straight-forward/experimental duel.  Side one is straight-ahead Sabbath.  Side two is epic Sabbath expanding their sound.

B00006LLNU|5.0|Sigur Ros is, without a doubt, one of my favorite bands of all time.  What these guys do can't be described; you have to hear it for yourself to understand.  I think the word beautiful gets thrown around too much these days, but if any album I own deserves the title, this one is it.  I mean, there isn't a bad track on the whole disc.  How often does that happen?  Sure, some tracks are better than others, but that's only because those tracks (1, 3, and especially 4 & 8 in my opinion) are so mind-blowingly good that they would put anything else to shame no matter what.  Track 4 has one of the most amazing introductions that I've ever heard, and track 8 is, through and through, spectacular.  It's like the whole CD is snow falling on a hillside, and the end of track 8 is the avalanche.  It gives me chills every time I hear it. <br /> <br />If you are already looking into getting this CD you're probably the type of person who will love it, so stop reading this and buy it.  You won't regret it.
B000002KIK|3.0|Ozzy said that he was ashamed of this album, that it took so frigging long to make Never Say Die! that the entire vision of the album was lost.  He's not far off.  Drugs!  Alcohol! Ego-Demons! The War was on!  Sabbath was in full-scale shambles.  During the recordng sessions for Never Say Die! Tony Iommi would lock himself away in a room to do cocaine all day, only to emerge at night to record his musical parts by himself. Ozzy would drink himself unconscious. How's that for a tight, nuclear band?  Never Say Die! gets three stars simply for two songs.  One is the title track and the other is Johnny Blade.  Everything else is far to the left or far to the right.  Let's check out the track listing:<br /><br />Never Say Die - The final classic Sabbath tune with Ozzy at the helm.  A solid rocker.  Clean.  Neat.  Metal!<br /><br />Johnny Blade - Future Ozzy keyboardist Don Airey gives us a peak at the diection Ozzy's solo career will take in this killer tune.  I don't know why, but this song is catchy.  A personal favorite.  Ozzy sounds alive again after the butchery that was Techncal Ecstasy.  Awesome.<br /><br />Junior's Eyes - Starts off like a mellow lounge jam.  Very low key.  Ozzy belts it out here.  The riffs start to flow.  Not a bad tune.  Teenage angst song.<br /><br />A Hard Road - Straight-ahead rocker.  Kinda light for Sabbath, but what's new.  Good, catchy chorus. A bit simple.<br /><br />Shock Wave - The opening riff is very promising, very hard and Iommi delivers it with passion.  The lyrics are kinda mixed and that detracts from making it memorable.  Sounds kinda like Sabbath trying to be Kiss. Sounds like something from The Elder.<br /><br />Air Dance - Good intro riff and then it slides into piano lounge music with over-delayed Ozzy vocals.  Boring. Don Airey is good.  But we didn't buy Sabbath to hear the hired keyboardist, right? Dragging.  Is this Sabbath or Tony Orlando and Dawn?<br /><br />Over To You - Iommi had some great riffs going on but they sounded mechanical and reheated.  The songs start blending together into the indistinguishable and that ain't good.  Ozzys vocals are too high and phased out.  They did that far too much in the later Sabbath years. Thought it sounded eerie and haunting. Probably hid some of Ozzy's setbacks as a singer. Hmmmm.  This song is boring.  Over to you.  What can I do?  Exactly!<br /><br />Breakout - Uh....What the f*ck is this?  Are we in a Jazz Bar for heroin addicts?  Or is this supposed to be a Black Sabbath album?  I don't know where this saxophone-laced jam came from, but it should have stayed there.  Unreal.<br /><br />Swinging The Chain - Bill Ward gets the last laugh on the last Sabbath album with the original lineup. And we're sooooooo sorry.  The worst progression change in rock history?  Close. What is this tripe?<br /><br />The end of an era.  A year later Ozzy would piss off ringleader Tony Iommi with his missing stints and his drunken lateness and that would be it.  Iommi would employ Ozzy's best friend, Bill Ward, to do the dirty deed of firing Ozzy as Sabbath's singer.  We should thank Iommi forever!  Not only does tha open the door for Sabbath: The Dio Years, but it also gives us Blizard Of Ozz, the greatest heavy metal album of all time!  Ozzy and Sabbath will fight publically for years to come, but Never Say Die! was not the way the most influential metal band of all neeeded to go out.  Blasphemy.<br /><br />Deal with it!sounded mechanical and reheated.  The songs start blending together into the indistinguishable and that ain't good.  Ozzys vocals are too high and phased out.

B0009UC7H0|1.0|Well, this won't take very long.  Warning!  Spoiler here! <br /> <br />Leading characters find themselves in a deadly, hopeless situation.  Characters find some ludicrously unbelievable way out of said deadly, hopeless situation.  One character makes a stupid joke, gives the others the high five and then Magic Carpet Ride starts playing.  Repeat 10 times, and there you have Sahara.  Wacky fun...if you play Little League and had less than 13 candles on your last birthday cake.   <br /> <br />Really, I usually put a lot of time in my reviews, but this one doesn't even deserve that.  Dumbest movie I've seen in quite some time.
0780619587|1.0|My father and I loved the movie \\"Shine\\"; it should never have been advertised or presented as a true story of an actual person or his family.  After reading David's sister, Margaret's, book on their family and David's mental illness, I will never be able to view \\"Shine\\" in the same way.  I believe Hollywood should have ethical boundaries in terms of what they portray as true or as a biography when the fictionalized account defames living people and misrepresents actual people and severe mental illness.  I recommend people read the book Out of Tune to correct misconceptions about real people portrayed in this film.  The cast for this film was first-rate and it would have been a boxoffice hit without stating that it was true or an actual biopic; without it tied to actual people in this distorted way I would have rated the movie 5 stars.  Bravo to all the people attempting to set the record straight!
038572179X|4.0|This is my second McEwan read in the last few weeks and I'm starting to think that all his books will be good, but not great.I found this book well worth the effort of sticking in there. It was slow going for much of the time with, for me, too much description of everything. But I made myself read every word and benefited. The story concerns a young girl in 1935, Briony Tallis, whose juvenile prejudices cause her to wrongly believe and then convince others that Robbie Turner has committed a crime. It is all set up extremely well. The first half of the book is set in a large country home/small mansion and reeks of upper classes. The second half is set in the Second World War after Briony's testimony has disrupted lives and broken up her own family. It is beautifully written though sometimes slow and overly descriptive. I found the ending extremely unsatisfying- I don't need to be told I'm reading a novel. I don't want to be given ending `A' and then be told that ending `B' is what `really happened'. I found that condescending. Nevertheless, the good things about the book more than make up for the bad. McEwan seems very close with this and Eduring Love (my previous read) to writing a great book but he slows things down far too much. But I would recommend this all the same.
B000077VR3|1.0|How the film-makers achieved financing to make this film I'll never understand.  The make-up, costuming, screen-writing, directing, acting, cinematography, editing are all over-the-top and way over-done.  It looks like an amateur film-school project.  Nicole Kidman is beautiful--the one bright spot in this film.  For some reason, a film set in the late 19th century had the male lead and entire cast break out singing \\"The Sound of Music\\" by Rodgers and Hammerstein.  Someone must have been smoking something illegal that lead to this manic, ridiculous parody? of a musical.  Nowhere did I read a review that said it was a parody and farce; it was supposed to be a musical.  There was no way I could view this film for more than 15 minutes, and that long just to see if the title character would awake from a drug-induced nightmare. I love musicals but this one should definitely be viewed free on television and not rented or bought until you see if you can stand it. Save your money--it is awful.  Note:  If I had read a review such as this, I would have saved myself time and money.
0060589469|5.0|This book weaves together a story about a motorcycle journey, commencing in the Midwest and ending along the California coast, with a \\"Chautauqua\\" - an inquiry into values, which delves into Western philosophy in a way that intends practical consequences. The journey west on a motorcycle is mythic in a sense, drawing comparison to going West a century ago or going West today, thirty years after this book was written. The journey also involves a rather harrowing kind of story: of a man trying his best to fit his life together in order to guide his young son through a particularly crucial and troubling time. <br /> <br />Some reviewers see the Chautauqua part of the book as excessive reflection and even condescending. That may be true as far as their point of view is concerned. But for all the abstraction in this purported novel, it does have a great deal of clarity; the ideas are compelling; and it is relatively straightforward and not that difficult to follow. Abstract thought is the predilection of the narrator, and he struggles with himself  to find a basis in Western thought that will help him come to grips with the whirling pace of technological change in modern life. Eastern thought comes into play as a kind of crystallization of his ideas. The word \\"Zen\\", as it is used here, is a catch word that refers to an Eastern point of view - a way of being or orienting toward the world that unites subject and object and centers on the word \\"Quality\\".   <br /> <br />In my opinion, this book is as timely as ever. The narrator begins the Chautauqua by noting the difficulties that people with a romantic point of view, such as the DeWeeses, have in adapting to the complications of technology. Thirty years ago, it seems to me, people like the DeWeeses - romantics who rebelled against technology - had a stronger voice than they do today. Today, technology has become so much more pervasive, and the opportunities to evade technology so significantly fewer, that their voices noware being drowned out. To me, finding a way to adapt to technology and still remain a whole person, who has not given up on the pursuit of \\"Quality\\", is a very compelling pursuit.
B000002H4C|5.0|I saw the movie when it came out, and a few times on cable over the years, and loved it. So when the DVD came out, I bought it. Major disappointment!! Apparently, the idiots who made the movie failed to secure the rights to use the music in the DVD release. The bland and generic rock they used just killed the film. So- I bought the soundtrack. <br />It's just as great as my memories! As I listened to Hagar's \\"Heavy Metal\\", I realized it was the music that made the film. Without it- the movie is flatassed boring. <br />Now- I just watch the DVD without sound and que the soundtrack at the appropirate moments. It works.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Such a joy to watch this version of Jane Eyre. Rochester & Jane are captivating! They don't make books and films very often nowadays to match this amazing classic. Two of the most wonderful evenings I ever spent with my wife watching quality television.
B000UOGHKS|5.0|Erotica by Madonna is a brlliant and much ignored album. Released in 1992, this album was written off as a kiss of death, at first I didn't like it either but over the past year I have grown to love this album as much as Like A Prayer or Ray of Light. Madge is at her best when she is angry and provactive. The best song on the album is Words, could be the best song she has ever recorded. Secret Garden, Where Life Begins, and Erotica are the only \\"dirty\\" tracks on the record, I like them all! We get some really beautiful moments on here like Rain, Waiting, In This Life, and Bye Bye Baby. The song that's pure camp is Thief of Hearts, I could listen to that under-rated gem all day. I am so glad I gave Erotica another chance, Madonna is the only pop artist that takes risks anymore, this oldie but goodie does not disappoint! Enjoy.
B000HT2P9S|5.0|Often when a book I am reading is coming to an end, I begin to feel down, knowing that the characters I've been exploring will soon part. The main character in Neil Gaiman's \\"American Gods\\" also had this effect on me, but at the same time, I was glad to see his story end. The characters name is \\"Shadow\\" and his adventure will take him throughout the U.S.A., with grifters, drunks, police men, hitch-hikers, and gods. He will converse with the dead, gamble against deities, drive with immortals, and eat some decent meals along the way. His path is one that you will be unable to guess where it is heading next, and that perhaps is Gaimans greatest strength as a writer; he entices you with imagination and leads you through a maze, and you cannot help but follow.<br /><br />\\"American Gods\\" explores the Lore of civilizations all over the world, and how they came to the shores of America, and once here, what happened to them. It is a fantastic read, I loved it.

B0000399WC|3.0|This is a good film. It is excellently shot, consistently well acted, interesting, and all in all good solid entertainment, and it is based on fact so there is that added worthy \\"eduatainment\\" feeling. In fact, if this film was based on an original script it would probably be the best prison film of all time. The thing is though, that it isn't. It is based on \\"Papillon\\" by Henri Charriere, and the book is so much better than the film that the film pales into total insignificance when compared to it. Its not that the film is bad, it is just that the book delivers 5000% more than the film could ever hope to, in scope, drama, plot, excitement, intrigue, breadth and ... pure distilled human spirit. <br /> <br />The book is a masterpiece, easy to read, and functionally perfect. The film is a pale imitation, and an entertainment. See the film if you want, but if you like the film, take my advice and read the book because the book will blow you away and live with you in a wonderful place in your heart and mind for the rest of your life. If you hate the film, give the book a shot as well, since I believe that \\"Papillon\\" is truly universal and easily, far and away, one of the best books ever written. <br /> <br />
B000J103PC|5.0|I used to work for someone who was exactly like Meryl Streep's character Miranda Priestly (although it wasn't in a journalism setting, unfortunately), so I could relate to this movie all too well.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway's character of Andy Sachs was exactly the way I felt while working for this individual, and I could see myself living with my job the way Andy did with hers.  I felt like a new person when I finally quit that hellhole.<br /><br />I never did have the time for individuals such as the shallow and self-important people featured in the movie.  Everyone is out for #1, everyone is the boss, everyone is the only one who \\"gets it,\\" and there's a tremendous amount of unnecessary backstabbing and cattiness that goes on.  And the ring leader of the circus (the head boss) just likes to see everyone jumpy and miserable (as Andy stated in a moment of frustration).<br /><br />Meryl Streep, as always, played a believeable mega-boss in Miranda Priestly.  She was so good that I had to remind itself it was just acting.  Anne Hathaway was her usual charming self.  She has worked very well with legendary actresses (who can actually act!) such as Streep and Julie Andrews and her movies with them are enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />\\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" is a great movie to show people the pitfalls of tossing aside everyone and everything that you know and love in your quest for number one - and how empty, lonely, and full of \\"drama\\" being at the top can be.  - Donna Di Giacomo
B000MTPANQ|5.0|Neil Young in his grungey prime - performing LIVE at Massey Hall.  1971.  Age 24. A beautifully remastered CD and DVD of Neil Young unplugged long before MTV coined the term.  Neil performs much of the Harvest Album solo on a darkened stage in his native Canada.  Switching between several vintage Martin guitars and a Steinway piano, Neil performs his haunting music with passion and artistry.  His Young voice is strong and clear.  His flatpicking guitar work inspired.  Drop-D tuning never sounded so good, as Neil re-tunes his guitars between each song. <br /> <br />Audiophile sonic quality in both the cd and dvd.  The acoustics of this intimate stage were beautifully captured from the original recording.  The Mixing of voice, instrument, and crowd are among the very best live recordings I have ever heard. You can feel the bronzed acoustic strings slapping and bending across well-worn steel frets.  You feel the strain as Neil reaches for a high note.   Album highlights include memorable renditions of: Old Man, Ohio, Needle and the Damage Done, Cowgirl in the Sand, Down by the River, and a lovely medley of A Man needs a Maid & Heart of Gold performed on piano.   <br /> <br />The DVD is artistically filmed by mixing still photographs with actual concert footage and a recurring vision of a vintage reel-to-reel tape player spinning its reels in front of a microphone.  The filmmakers ironic imagery suggests the origin of this wonderful soundtrack.  Neil is captured in the full glory of his youth.  Long stringy black hair covering most of his face as he performs from a quiet seated posture.  It feels as though Neil is performing for you in his own living room.  The DVD is dark and almost film-noir in its grainy newsreel quality.  Despite the obvious limitations of the archived film clips, the tight close-ups of Neil performing are emotionally moving.  The passion of this young genius is palpable as he pours himself into each of his musical creations.      <br /> <br />I cannot help but see a haunting resemblance between sight and sound of Neil at Massey Hall in 1971 and Kurt Cobain's unplugged performance on an MTV stage 30 years later.  A talent worthy of imitation.  A talent worthy of this beautiful reprise of his early work.
0596009208|5.0|If you are not already familiar with the \\"Head First\\" series of books, they are technical books on various subjects that feature an unconventional method of learning. They usually include crossword puzzles, Q&A sessions, fake conversations between different pieces of code, and even cartoons so that the subject matter will stand out in the reader's mind versus the format of a standard textbook. If you like the more conventional approach, you might be advised to stick with the old standard tutorial on Java, \\"Core Java\\" by Cornell.<br /><br />The book starts out talking about the history of Java, the various versions of Java, and what is different about each one. It then goes on to explain the very basics of writing a Java application and then illustrates with the book's first so-called \\"serious business application\\" - a Java version of the song \\"90 bottles of beer\\". Of course, as is typical in the head-first series, the book codes the application up somewhat incorrectly in its first attempt and asks you to find the problem. The second chapter is an introduction to objects, their value, and how they are implemented in Java. From that point forward, for the next eight chapters or so, you are not seeing content much different from what you would see in any thorough book on the Java programming language - just a difference in presentation.<br /><br />Starting in chapter 11, the book takes a series of subjects that can get involved and, as a result, often lose the reader, and makes it interesting by building a Music Machine - specifically a BeatBox Drum Machine. By building this application piece by piece the reader learns about exception handling, Java GUIs, Java Swing, and the interaction involved in all three subjects. The final chapters in the book deal with object serialization, networking and threads, data collections and generics, and releasing your code through packages and jar files. When it is applicable the BeatBox Drum Machine is toyed with to expand its capabilities and demonstrate the new concepts, but the author also shows some simpler applications to get the point across too. There hasn't been a really good book on Java distributed computing written in about ten years, and the next chapter goes over the basics of the subject for beginners. It does a good job of explaining the purpose and use of RMI, servlets, Enterprise JavaBeans, and even some Jini at a basic level.<br /><br />This is a good book for someone who is just starting to learn Java, and is very suitable for self-study. However, although most people really love the head-first series, there are a very few people that just hate this approach. Thus you might want to glance at any book in the head-first series and see if this style of learning appeals to you before purchasing this particular book.pabilities and demonstrate the new concepts, but the author also shows some simpler applications to get the point across too.

6304806418|5.0|This masterpiece of film-making needs re-evaluation since in hindsight it can be seen for the superb and masterful work of art and entertainment that it is. I have now seen the film three times and each time I am amazed that this film has not been recognized widely for its considerable attributes. <br /> <br />How does a director convey the oppressive nature of Fascism in a musical? Alan Parker succeeds wonderfully through his use of a muted brown, beige, black, and vanilla color range. He does it through the wonderful photography of riots, poverty, wealth, militarism, and the signs and symbols of power. The cinematography in this film is great. The art direction is super. The editing is perfect. It is a mystery to me why this film wasn't more appreciated by the public.  <br /> <br />I think one reason is that folks don't know history and understand the rise of fascism in Germany, Italy, Spain, and Argentina in the 1930s and 1940s. Peron's brand of fascism was threatening to the oligarchy in Argentina that had ruled a nation of farmers and cowboys and peasants. Thus there is no clear picture of good guys and bad guys in the film. At times Eva's appeals to the poor and underserved, the establishment of her foundation, and her ability to communicate with the masses puts her in the role of saint. However, the extortion of the rich to pay for her charities and thus maintain the popularity of Peron is a shrewed political power play. <br /> <br />Madonna is super in this film. Her acting is not naturalistic because she is playing an over-the-top diva and saint. It is Antonio Banderas who gives us a running commentary thorughout the film that continually grounds the viewer in the facts and the actions in this opera. <br /> <br />One last comment: there are very few songs that have the power of Webber and Rice's Don't Cry for Me Argentina. Madonna's performance is spotless when she sings this from her balcony to the crowd below.
B000N6TX1I|4.0|Clive Owen plays Theo, a reluctant hero. He's asked to get a young girl to a sanctuary called the 'Human Project'. When Theo realizes the reason behind the urgency, he plunges in to danger to protect the pregnant woman in a time when no babies are being born. She's a sought after commodity and many groups want to promote her for their own political or financial purposes. The film can be slightly predictable in spots, but it's worth watching. I'd recommend renting first to see if you really want to add it to your Science Fiction, DVD collection.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author
0553296981|5.0|\\"Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl\\" is one of the most significant historical records in the history of mankind.  It is a diary that leaves one forever changed for the better to have been through the emotional and heart-wrenching experience of sharing the thoughts, ideas, emotions, and observations of a teenage girl who died during the final days of World War Two.  Anne was a teenager whose keen insight and profound intellect speaks to the heart, soul, and mind of every reader....she has been widely loved and respected all over our world for the messages of love and hope she leaves to us from so long ago......<br /><br />  Anne Frank was born in 1929 and died of starvation, neglect, and disease shortly before her sixteenth birthday.  She and her family were forced into hiding by the evil force that mercilessly and relentlessly hunted them.  While trapped in a tiny set of rooms, Anne wrote what would become the most moving account of what it was like to suffer under Nazi tyranny that was to survive and emerge from this dark age in our world's history, thus leaving the world a vivid account of what the end result of state-sponsored prejudice and discrimination can spawn.<br /><br />  While Anne's diary still has the power to make people weep decades after her tragic death, this remarkable teenager's writing ultimately had the power to do what no other diary or essay of the time accomplished --- Anne Frank's work bankrupted the idelology of National Socialism.<br /><br />  It's almost impossible for those of the Twenty-First Century to understand that in the first half of the Twentieth Century the ideology of National Socialism had the support of some in the intellectual community.  While it took the combined might of the Allied Armed Forces to militarily defeat the military forces representing the ideology of National Socialism, it has never been possible for military force to defeat an ideology.  Anne Frank's diary accomplished what no other intellectual of her time was able to do.....her diary bankrupted the intellectual foundations of the National Socialist ideology that had led the world to such agony and grief during the Second World War.  Anne Frank's influence on future generations is multi-faceted..... she speaks to those who read her diary as an account of what it is like to cross the bridge from childhood to adulthood and to travel this bridge under the most difficult conditions imagineable, as well as those who read her diary as an account of what the ultimate result becomes when a nation embraces the ideology of hate, fear, and force.<br /><br />Anne Frank is one of the most influential historical figures of our era, and her diary is one of the most significant first-person historical accounts of tragedy and triumph that has ever been left as a priceless gift for future generations........Her diary will remain as a beacon of hope and understanding for all mankind forever and ever and always and always to the end of time!<br /><br />----- John Michael O'Loughlinime was able to do.....her diary bankrupted the intellectual foundations of the National Socialist ideology that had led the world to such agony and grief during the Second World War.

B000005RS0|1.0|DONT BUY it from AMAZON!   I got burned, I bought what was supposed to be the new delux edition and what I received was the original CD release.  I'd rather buy items like this from official stores instead of Amazon after that hell of an experience.  Over-all, its a great album
B000MR1V22|5.0|I'm going to be brief here.  This is just a darn good movie.  It has sort of a Wes Anderson feel to it, but no voice over or things of that nature.  This is the type of movie that makes you laugh in places where you didn't think you were going to laugh.  Just watch and enjoy.
B000O178BY|5.0|Absolute genius! Trent Reznor never disappoints. Year Zero is an absolute masterpiece, beginning to end. Trent continues to produce powerful works of art that kick the music world right in the chest. It the best feeling in the world to be able to trust in an artist, and know that each and every release is nothing short of genius. It is evident, the minute you listen to Year Zero, that the amount of time, effort and heart that went into it, was enormous. Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails always add a fresh, new, unique and powerful element to today's music. While there are some quality artists out there, there is also a large quantity of recycled crap. You never know what you are going to get, from one cd to the next. With Trent Reznor, you do know. You know you are going to get a quality, mind blowing work of art. Thank you Trent and please don't ever stop.
B000F2O4MI|4.0|Great look on cultural difference, with twisted humor.  Another great Adam Sandler movie, with great co-stars.  Gives you insight of americas' dysfunctial families.  I would buy this if you already own some adam sandler films
B000JBWWRY|5.0|This was always one of my favorite Disney movies.  I am happy to say that it is now one of my 2 daughter's favorites as well.  We got the DVD when it came out and they have watched it over and over.  All I can say is that I am glad that DVD movies don't wear out like VHS or Beta.<br /><br />The clarity of the images is fantastic.  Disney re-releases are always beautiful and this is no exception.<br /><br />Special features are great for the adults or older children.<br /><br />A definite must have for any family, but especially for those of us who remember or, more importantly, can't remember what it was like to be a kid.
B000MV8ABS|4.0|Well, I finally got to see what all the cult fuss was about when I picked up PHANTASM's newest DVD release. This is for the 2007 Anchor Bay release in the white-ish poster art slipcover. I won't dig too deep on plot points (Hell, were there REALLY any solid plot points? *as I begin ducking all the rotten tomatoes being thrown at me from die-hard fans*lol;-) so I'll try & stick to the product junk as seen through the eye(s)  of a PHANTASM newbie.    THE PACKING: I'm a packaging ho', so every little bit extra is always a plus in my book. Makes ya feel like ya got more for your buck. And in this case, being yet another movie I'd bought sight unseen after only hearing about it for years, well, that can only help. HERE, we get what's always welcome to me, slipcase/sleeve/jacket that slides over the actual DVD case. It's basically the same artwork as the DVD case label, so nothing special lies underneath. But the poster art is cool enough. I bought mine at (insert name of competition). And on the outer sleeve, there was a small -clear- sticky label....it looked like the printing company affixed it there to make a place for price stickers and such to be affixed so they didn't stick directly to the box. Weeeelllll.................that was a great idea, but when taking off THAT clear mask, it took off much of the PHANTASM foil logo that was directly underneath. So be warned especially if you are buying in a brick and mortar shop. Try and find one without, if this kind of stuff matters to you. Now the slipcover logo is red foil with 'silver accents' from where the sticky thing came up....and no.....it won't go back down either. Damage done.    FILM ITSELF: I said I wouldn't go over the plot, but a couple comments: As a late comer to the PHANTASM franchise, this was an entertaining way to kill some time. I was in school when this hit the theaters, and my Mom wouldn't let me see it, so I had only my friend's account of how cool it was back then..the sphere of course, was on everyone's cool-list. Well, now.......I kinda wish I saw it then, because I'd probably have a bit of nostalgia to tag onto my perceptions of the film. It was entertaining, but it certainly didn't knock my socks off. I kinda felt like it had such a huge overhead of low-budget-cult-legend-hype to live up to that it simply couldn't do it for me....and especially all these years later when we all know time softens the cult-film blow of many films no matter what budget and how big the audience is for it.     I could appreciate the overall surrealist feel to it. THAT was nice and effective. Unfortunately budget restraints stifled much of the impact and the rest, I had to imagine.....which I suppose, being a fan of old school ....REAL OLD SCHOOL horror from the 20's-60's, that shouldn't have been anything to be bothered by. But in this case....too much legend-ariness (lol! I swear that's a real word....I swears!;-) but it just couldn't meet the task in my book. And the acting? Well.......that was hit & miss.  However, I STILL enjoyed the film and won't be one of those viewers screaming about how I am so pissed about wasting two hours of my life. I'll actually watch it again in the coming months without a second thought, just to revisit the ATMOSPHERE, which seems to be the key to this movie from this outsider. And eeew.....just thinking about that chick 'turning' into the Thin Man........well, he/she WAS the other but the cuts there were effectively creepy.    PRINT QUALITY: I'm assuming the previous release was not anamorphic. This one is. On our widescreen TV here, it looks great. A few bits of junk here or there, but really, anyone complaining about this is really.....well....complaining too much I'd say. The transfer looks great. I had up until some of the effects shots thought they had a decent budget to work with, that's how good the film stock looked to me overall.....though there were some scenes where it was obvious they were re-inserted or something, maybe that's explained on the commentary. Sound-wise....no complaints, at least on our system, and we shake the walls here when the urge hits. We didn't wake the neighbors but the sound was sufficient enough for the Thin Man's sudden entrances to make us jump and make us wanna slap ourselves for being such girly men.. which we ......err..oh never mind..........hehe;-) ASPECT: 1:85:1 TIME: 88mins.    SPECIAL FEATURES: The PHANTASMAGORIA 30 min. piece was interesting and gave good insight as well as new appreciation for me not really knowing a damn thing about this film. I guess this(?) was not on the other release of PHANTASM. In it, the cast talks about the film (really?;-) and it's loaded with behind the scenes stuff. The good thing I liked about this, was no one was screaming in self importance like you see in some documentaries....you know... where everyone has to tell you how miserable they were but still managed to turn out a hit ....blah blah blah    OVERALL: I'm happy with this purchase. Nice low budget fun. Not scary-scary (but what is scary anyway?)....but more dreamy/nightmarish stuff that you fill in the blanks with. I really wanted to give this 3.75 stars but alas, I can't. It has a good mood to it, something that is lacking in many low budget flicks so a 4 isn't too much of a stretch. PACKAGING/PRODUCT-wise....they did a good job. It's interesting enough to look at....Hell, when even the inside opens up to more design (clear case/double sided printed label/screened disc), THAT is a good thing to see they didn't get lazy &  thought about all that too.
B00027JZ3E|5.0|First of all, im not going to get into the history of who's in it and who isn't.  Second, this movie is a DEFINITE! for Vampires fan. Third, Keifer Sutherland at his best, although Coreys are lame together, in this movie they did work together as best as they could.  Fourth, the Movie, the plot, the action, and the look of the vampires, are all Cool.  This movie is a must *HAVE* especially the 2 Disc Edition.  The Fifth reason is just that, the bonus CD is extremely what EVERY \\"COLLECTOR'S EDITON\\" should be.  This is the a great movie and a great buy any place for the price!
B000CC4GEW|4.0|\\"Waterloo\\" is the lavish 1970 Italian-Russian dramatization of Napoleon's return from exile in 1815 and his subsequent campaign against an Allied military force in Belgium, culminating in his decisive defeat at Waterloo.<br /><br />A brief prologue traces the circumstances of Napoleon's abdication from his throne as Emperor of the French in 1814 and his exile to the Island of Elba.  The movie opens with Napoleon's daring return, as the sheer power of his personality cult enables him to face down the very forces sent to take him into custody.  Napoleon's return to Paris prompts the Allied Coalition that forced his abdiction to reform and send British and Prussian armies into Belgium.<br /><br />The movie features excellent period authenticity.  Actors appear in the correct uniforms and equipment; the battle scenes feature large formations of infantry and cavalry moving over a battlefield that generally resembles the Mount St. Jean original in Belgium.<br /><br />The movie is superbly cast.  Rod Stieger is entirely credible as the aging but still fiercely ambitious and egotistical Napoleon.  Christopher Plummer is pitch-perfect as the aristocratic Duke of Wellington, highly capable leader of a British-Dutch Army, acting in concert with a Prussian Army under General Blutcher. Orson Welles has a nice cameo as Louis XVIII.  The supporting cast universally look their parts.<br /><br />The Battle of Waterloo has been challenging for generations of historians to describe.  Likewise, this movie dramatization can be very difficult to follow.  The movie faithfully depicts various dramatic moments in the battle, although it seems to presume some prior knowledge on the part of the viewer as to the context of those moments.  It repeatedly changes points of view, alternating for the most part between Napoleon and Wellington.  There are several supporting vignettes involving Marshall Ney and others.  The movie succeeds in building up enormous dramatic tension as the battle nears its climax, even if the viewer may not be entirely clear on what is happening and why.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended to fans of the Napoleonic era as perhaps the best-available dramatization of the Battle of Waterloo.le nears its climax, even if the viewer may not be entirely clear on what is happening and why.  <br /> <br />This movie is highly recommended to fans of the Napoleonic era as perhaps the best-available dramatization of the Battle of Waterloo.
B000MCH5P4|2.0|I just watched this film, and I thought it was irritating, which is why I gave it 2 stars vs. one (if it didn't even make me angry, I'd give it 1)  Besides the 4 \\"cool\\" inter-twining plots, we had a typical liberal bashing of being American and how selfish we are.  I read a few of the one star reviews and I agree with the lack of coherence, the meaningless storlines, etc.., but the one thing that really, really bugged me about the movie was the \\"American snob\\" message that was embedded.  The message being:  after all of the drama in \\"typical American fashion\\", since we are soooo great, the wife was fine, in but the poor son from Morroco was appartantly left to die and who cares, we'll just kill him (or not tell you what happens), and no one (especially Americans) cares, except maybe the dad, because all that matters is that of the American wife is so more important that she lives. And let's just dump the Mexian lady who has been here for 16 years on the other side of the border since that's how us American's think. <br /> <br />This movie is garbage.
B00000I3JO|5.0|I feel compelled to correct a reviewers comments that this is a Welsh band. They are most definitely a Scottish band and yet one more example of the greatness of Scottish music from Annie Lennox to Travis to Simple Minds to Deacon Blue and on to Blue Nile to name a few.On a more serious note, this is one of the most original and perfect albums of all time. It transcends time and genre. All these years later it still gives me great pleasure and really does cause goosebumps to appear from the mournful lyrics touching your musical soul. They have made only a few albums and although all have some greatness none of them reach the total perfection of Hats. A sure sign of its greatness is the amount of praise and versions of these songs you will find from other great musicians like Annie, Rod Stewart, Peter Gabriel and Craig Armstrong. These are people who know what they are hearing.
B000N6TX1I|4.0|***SPOILERS AHEAD!!!***<br /><br />Cuaron's bleak dystopic vision is an excellent film, full of good acting, striking imagery, and sheer technical mastery of the film medium. The production design and numerous spectacular long takes will amaze viewers even over numerous viewings. The take on the basic plotline of the novel by P.D. James has been considerably revamped from her book, and the resulting movie though probably a better piece of cinema than a more faithful adaptation of the book would have been, will nevertheless be mainly unrecognizable to fans of the novel. The revised focus and treatment may also strike some viewers as being both overtly politicized and also perhaps overly topical, which means this film may not have the long term viability of say \\"Blade Runner\\" as a view of the future imperfect, but it is still a great ride in the short term.<br /><br />James' novel speculating on the end of human fertility and the resulting societal disorder was a somber talky meditation on Christian eschatology. The Jamesian society portrayed grappled for meaning but in a way that clearly showed what you believed in determined how you would live in such a grim scenario. The movie has far less concern with Christianity as a world view and so assumes that society would rapidly fall into hellish disrepair with surviving governments rapidly becoming fascist xenophobic police states. This latter position both allows for more obvious cinematic application and also reflects a far more widespread body of secular belief as to the untrustworthiness of government and a generally bleak view of human nature. To Cuaron, humans are both sheep who need to be led and also dumb herd animals who make generally bad choices as to which brutal and manipulative shepherds will lead them.<br /><br />We are barraged with police state imagery. Riot troops wait at bus stops, immigrants are herded into brutal detainment camps and treated harshly by mainly Caucasian police and soldiers, and civil liberties have been completely discarded in order to secure the shaky peace and limited prosperity of the legitimate citizens of the state. We see detainees made to wear hoods and menaced with dogs in a virtual iconographic rehash of the Abu Ghraib prison scandal of yesteryear. This is the topical element of the film, and also the aspect that may make \\"Children of Men\\" seem a bit dated 20 years from now, if (as we should hope!) such images are no longer a part of our popular media and culture. \\"Brazil\\" for instance, another police state dystopia film, has aged very well primarily because Gilliam chose to avoid over-utilization of contemporary images and instead aimed for something both timeless and surreal. Cuaron's grittier presentation has more immediate impact, but may have audiences at retro film fests in 2037 scratching their heads...<br /><br />The anti-immigrant fascist state pictured here may also strike some as a typical leftist Hollywood style diatribe. It may very well be that, but we must also look more deeply at the underlying ideology of the setting. We hear only hints and pieces of the world's backstory here, but we do learn that both Manhattan and Madrid have been destroyed by terrorist nukes. We know there are various bombings occurring throughout England on a daily basis (and though some characters say the government is doing this, we the audience have no idea if that is true). We also hear about the collapse of many other nation states including the U.S.<br /><br />Given this global background of chaos and despair, and the relative order and prosperity of England in this scenario, it is not exactly the height of Marxist paranoia to posit that the UK government might behave aggressively to defend what its citizens do have, even to the point of emphasizing security at the expense of liberty. Many people and governments throughout all ages have done exactly that, so Cuaron's portrayal of this society should not necessarily be read as an indictment ofcurrent social and political trends, but rather as an unsympathetic meditation as to where those trends might lead given a huge societal disturbance, i.e. the end of women bearing children. And this concept of future society is in the end based on that unsympathetic rendering of human nature that is at the heart of most secular beliefs on both the political right and the left - mainly that people respond to stimuli by doing what is convenient, profitable, and most secure for them, no matter what impact those decisions have on others or the world at large.<br /><br />It should also be pointed out that the main baddies here are NOT the \\"fascist government\\" which is at some level responding to both the wishes of the public and an objectively terrible and hopeless set of circumstances. The main villains instead are the Fish, the revolutionary group that wants to overthrow the government, and that is content to murder both its own members and innocents, deceive sympathetic supporters, and put a pregnant woman and her precious child at risk in order to play politics with what may be the sole possible means of continuing the human race in order to serve their own selfish agenda. The leftist revolutionaries are the ones who murder Julian, Jasper the hippie character (who kills his wife and dog because he suspects the Fish would torture them), the refugee who tries to help lead Kee and Theo to the boat, and ultimately Theo himself. In the best Orwellian tradition then, the bad guys are not only the government, but also those who supposedly are fighting against the monsters who have themselves become monsters.<br /><br />Therefore I do not find Cuaron's artistic voice to be neither tiresomely polemical nor blatantly unrealistic. We have here instead a fine speculative scenario, crafted with a naturalistic focus, and not one that strikes me as being impossible. The path to goodness and virtue here, in Cuaron's apparently Christless world, is altruism and dedication to others, and Clive Owen's character arc shows that clearly, as does Jasper and the various other characters who assist Kee and her child on their pilgrimage.<br /><br />Although I may personally wish that the Christian theme of James' novel was more overtly developed in Cuaron's film, I have no objection to his alternate choice of theme and development. My one criticism is the ending, which at the same time creates a deus ex machina, raises a whole bunch of common sense issues (why are there boats in a prison camp next to the ocean and no maritime patrols off the coast?), and also shows Cuaron's leftist sympathies to be capable of overpowering the script a bit.

1401207529|5.0|Before he would write Sin City and 300, Frank Miller first achieved fame by his reinvention of Daredevil for Marvel before taking flight to DC.  In 1986, he crafted the masterpiece that is the Dark Knight Returns, and a couple years later, he would lend his talents again in his re-imagining of the origin of Batman with Year One.  The story centers around Bruce Wayne, who has just returned to Gotham City after spending twelve years honing his skills, as well as Lieutenant Jim Gordon who is new to town and apparently the only clean cop in the city.  Both have rude awakenings as they cross paths in their efforts to fight in this lawless, decaying, urban wasteland.  What really makes Year One so good is that Miller shows us a rookie Batman who has more than his share of troubles on his first forays in the costumed hero business, which in itself is entertaining.  His depiction of Gordon is effective as well; humanizing the stalwart cop to great effect.  You'll see plenty of familiar characters as well here in Year One, including Harvey Dent and Selina Kyle and her transformation into Catwoman; as well as many elements that were used in Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins film.  David Mazzucchelli's art is dark and dreary, which suits Miller's tone superbly and is wonderfully done.  All in all, if you've never read Batman: Year One, you have been missing out, and it more than deserves a place in your graphic novel library.

B00014K5TQ|3.0|It's worth seeing this movie if you like Seth Green. He's just adorable in it. It's an interesting movie that might be stuck in your head for a while after watching. Mostly you might be saying \\"Why did I watch that?\\". If you like watching different movies then go for this one. I wouldn't recommend buying it though.

B00005JNS0|5.0|\\"Cars\\" is the first Pixar movie I did not buy immediately. But finally I got tired of waiting for the rental copy, and I bought it. <br /> <br />The delay was due to the trailer not really doing much for me. Also, I felt that cars is a dubious choice for animated characters. Unlike bugs or toys, they don't have arms or faces, so it's a little forced, methinks. <br /> <br />That said, I'd have to say they pulled it off. Actually, looking at real cars after having seen this movie, I half expect them to move and open their eyes. <br /> <br />\\"Cars\\" is not the best or funniest Pixar movie. My faves are Monsters Inc, Toy Story 2, and The Incredibles. But \\"Cars\\" was still very worthwhile, I enjoyed it. And it is visually gorgeous. The scenery especially is amazing. <br /> <br />If you get the DVD, be sure not to miss the extras. The two shorts included, for one thing, are falling-over funny. <br /> <br />I also appreciate the basic message of the movie: winning is not everything. The western world is still a bit fixated on Being Number One. And contests can be fun and they can be inspiring, but ultimately they are just games, they are not life.
B000001DQI|5.0|This is Elton's best album, a double LP masterpiece without a wasted note or lyric.  From the epic opening suite Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding to the wonderful Harmony, every song is a pop masterpiece.  It's hard to pick out my favorite songs, because depending on my mood, I can listen to any song on this album at anytime.  So, here's a few.  I love the title track, This Song Has No Title, Grey Seal, Sweet Painted Lady, Jamacia Jerk Off, Roy Rogers, Social Disease, and Harmony.  I really like Jamacia Jerk Off and Social Disease, but then I can go for Grey Seal and This Song Has No Title.  Most people never give Elton credit for making some of the best pop music of the 1970's.  They treat him like an afterthought, which they shouldn't.  His music writing and playing talents are first rate.  The cover art is great, too.
0143036742|2.0|On the front page The Times is quoted to have written: \\"Extremely funny!\\". <br />I didn't have one laugh. Not even a smile. I think that says it all. Let me add that the writing is not bad, but the main theme of the book is almost stupid, sometimes disgusting and certainly boring. And the story contrived and exaggerated. The background story of the Ukrainian family having suffered through the Stalin's regime and WWII concentration camps is more interesting, but is too sporadic to improve the overall impression.
B000N3T0DW|4.0|In this complicated, absurdist and comedic saga by the Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar, five women from three generations negotiate the slings and arrows of life. Raimunda's (Penélope Cruz) husband Paco assaults her teenage daughter Paula, who in turn murders him with a kitchen knife. They stuff his body in a freezer. Raimunda's sister Sole lost her husband, and together they lost their parents in a fire, or so they wrongly think. But then their mother Irene \\"reappears\\" from her deceased sister's house (volver, \\"to return\\") as what the villagers think is a spirit, but turns out to be the real flesh and blood person who wants to settle life's business with her two girls and their friend Agustina--whose mother had an affair with Irene's husband. Thus, one reviewer compared Volver to high brow soap opera. My wife and I loved it, but agreed that the many plot trajectories require a second viewing to understand and appreciate it all. In Spanish with English subtitles.
B00005NVDF|5.0|It has almost been forgotten that this film was not directed by Woody Allen - but this makes no difference it is still one of his greatest films.<br /><br />We start the film with Allan Felix (Allen) watching Casablanca in the Cinema and feebly impersonating Bogart as he leaves the Cinema. The film proceeds with an imaginary Bogart advising Allan on how to deal with Women. Allan as you would expect is pretty hopeless!<br /><br />This film is consistently funny with the blind date scene being one of the greatest comedy scenes ever filmed.<br /><br />The script (based on Woody Allens own stage play) is full of great dialog, as you would expect.<br /><br />Diane Keaton is wonderful in her role, and Tony Roberts is very funny in his supporting role as the business man who leaves a telephone number so he can be contacted everywhere he goes.<br /><br />\\"I'll be at 362-9296 for a while; then I'll be at 648-0024 for about fifteen minutes; then I'll be at 752-0420; and then I'll be home, at 621-4598\\"<br /><br />Remember this film was made more than a decade before mobile phones even existed in brick form.<br /><br />The film finishes with a great recreation of the end of Casablanca.<br /><br />If you don't like Woody Allen then you probably won't like this. However, if you have any appreciation of Woody and haven't seen this, you should buy this DVD now.
B000LXH0AE|4.0|Harold Crick's (Will Ferrell) compulsively ordered and very lonely life is ruled by numbers, which makes sense because he is an IRS auditor. He brushes his teeth the same number of strokes each day, and knows exactly how many steps that he walks to the bus stop. A narrator voice-over gives us a running commentary, and soon we realize that the narrator is in fact Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson), a novelist who is writing the story of Harold's life and struggling to end the novel, and Crick's life, in a fitting way. His real life is her novel's plot. Harold also starts to hear Eiffel's voices in his head, and so he discovers that his life is unfinished and awaits her literary decisions as well as his personal choices. As his life approaches death Harold also falls for a delightfully quirky woman named Ana, who is his opposite--she sports tattoos and dropped out of Harvard Law School because she wanted to open a bakery. This is a very clever comedy that also stars Dustin Hoffman as a literature professor who functions as Crick's \\"therapist\\" to figure out the narrative plot of his life and the likely choices that Eiffel might make, and Queen Latifah as the novelist's assistant. This is a great comedy, love story, and poignant consideration of the \\"story\\" that every person must live.

B00005JPAO|5.0|I was not excited to view this film, but found myself getting slowly caught up in the fascinating story spun around the week of events after Princess Diana's death. Rather than taking the easy road and making Queen Elizabeth and the Royal Monarchy a target, this film chose to show both the new (Tony Blair) and the old (The Queen) in a fairly impartial light. It is much more interesting to see how both sides learn and grow from each other by being willing to communicate and learn in what must have been an extremely difficult situation. Helen Mirren gives a miraculous performance and actually appears to be channeling Her Royal Highness. As Philip, James Cromwell portrays one of the few characters in this film who is thoroughly unlikeable. As Charles, Alex Jennings gives the portrayal of a Prince who has spent his life in a state of limbo, and seems to be ineffective both as a Royal Leader as well as a leader in his own home. Beautiful story, well written, and stunning performances, not to mention visual perfection. Get this film!
B000ICL3KG|4.0|I really did not know what to expect with this movie.  I am not an Al Gore fan, and I am skeptical of the hype surrounding the global warming issue.  I must admit, though, that this movie is thought provoking. <br /> <br />Gore has definitely improved his ability to make a presentation.  He is much more likeable than during his presidential campaign, although I still had to wake myself up on several occasions to replay a scene or two.  He still has a tendency to treat adult audiences like a bunch of grade schoolers, and I did not think the side stories about his son's accident, his sister's health problems and the family tobacco farm added any meat to the message. <br /> <br />The movie made a very emotional case.  On further reflection, however, it delivered precious few hard facts.  The warming statistics were totally illegible, and my understanding from others knowledgeable in climate change is that at every opportunity, he took the most alarmist position possible. He also never deals with the fact that only a few years ago, the same scientific community that today embraces global warming was scaring us all with the coming of the next ice age. <br /> <br />Having vented all that, one cannot watch giant SUV's lumber down the highway or smokestacks dumping stuff into the air and conclude that they are good things. <br /> <br />Overall, I view this movie as an overdone, light on fact mixed bag that, in spite of itself, has increased my concern about our environment. <br /> <br />
B000HEWEE4|2.0|Chick flicks give me headaches to begin with; if there's a romance there better be either a violent, destructive car chase or an AK-47 gunfight interjected or I lose interest pronto.  But you throw in a space/time continuum component in a chick flick and I'm scratching my head and getting lost faster than a fourth grader in a quantum physics course.  Alas, such is the case with Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock, and THE LAKE HOUSE.  I watched this flick twice, and my head still hurts.  For instance:<br /><br />1.  If we accept the premise there are parallel universes (allowing Keanu and Sandra to correspond simultaneously, even though they are two years apart), how can the two actually interact in Keanu's universe?  If I remember my \\"Star Trek\\" factoids, don't people like implode when they occupy two universes at once?<br /><br />2.  (Spoiler Alert!)  And if Keanu dies on Valentine's Day 2006 (but then later on gets a heads up from Sandra not to cross that busy street) and then asks his brother what day it is (and his brother says, \\"It's Valentine's Day 2006\\") and thereby avoids his date with destiny, then at the end of the movie the two lovers finally meet and Sandra says, \\"You waited two years,\\" doesn't that mean it is now Valentine's Day 2008?  So this movie takes place in the future?<br /><br />3.  What's with the mailbox?  Keanu and Sandra both wait patiently at the Lake House, watching the mailbox. . .and then the flag mysteriously rises, indicating a letter will appear inside.  If the flag rises wouldn't that mean the parallel universes have again intertwined, whereby the two could interact (see Point 1 above)?<br /><br />4.  Poor Morgan (Dylan Walsh).  He really has the hots for Sandra, but she never gets more than lukewarm for him.  Yet he hangs on in the relationship.  Dumb Morgan.<br /><br />I could go on and on (and on).  Oh, and Keanu is as wooden as the desk I'm typing on, and Sandra is one ultra-depressed chick.  And Christopher Plummer is ageless.  That's it:  Plumber jumps from universe to universe; that's how he stays young.  Pass the aspirin.  2.5 stars.<br />--D. Mikels, beleaguered author, WALK-ONverse; that's how he stays young.  Pass the aspirin.  2.5 stars.  --D. Mikels, beleaguered author, WALK-ON

B000N6U0DS|1.0|I got this movie and found that it would not play on my DVD player (a Philips brand DVD recorder).  After returning it and getting a new version, the same problem happened. The same thing happened with the copy of \\"Stranger than Fiction\\" I got. After doing some research, I found that Sony is now using an encryption scheme that makes their newer DVD's unplayable on a large number of DVD players (even those that are under the Sony brand). What's more, they refuse to fix the problem. Stay away from their DVDs until they learn their lesson.
B00006JDVV|2.0|I found the concept for this movie to be fascinating and was very eager to see it.  However, even after excepting the existance of dragons in a modern world, I found that there were just far too many elements I could not find believable. <br />(And for anyone who wants to say - \\"It's fiction, it's not suposed to be believable\\" or \\"it's a movie about dragons, what do you expect?\\", I'll just say now that I expect a decent sci-fi/fantasy writer to make the impossible believable.) <br />1. The fact that the dragons only eat ash. Why? Ash would have no nutritional value. Are we supposed to believe that they are magic, and not real living creatures? Having them live on oil would have made more sense. <br />2. The fact that the dragons raw riot over the entire world while at the hieght of its military power but, some 20 years later, all it takes to kill one is a grenade tied to the end of an arrow? The worst part about this one is that they could have better explained things as the world had already suffered a massive war that allowed the dragons to roam unapposed. <br />3. Predators do not breed that fast, especially large ones. Ones that do wipe out the food supply and die themselves. (Just because they point that out in the movie does not make it good writing or a realistic breeding pattern for a large predatory species.) Of course, being that they ate ASH, why are they starving?!?!? <br /> <br />Dragon effects were quite well done, though. Of course, you can get Dragonslayer for a similar looking dragon and a better story.
B000002J6F|5.0|This album is Stephen Stills at his best. It is a great mix of different styles, even to the point where the album seems somewhat fragemented. There is a hearty display of the blues, country, bluegrass, and a Latin American touch. The countryish elements are nicely blended with the Latin American slant that is so often present in Stills' music. His time in Panama truly had influence on his music.  The album shows a great deal of emotion and is great musically. I think the best song on this album is \\"Jonny's Garden\\".

B000002AD0|4.0|Recorded well before Santana's classic 1969 debut LP, this hometown concert set is notable for several reasons. It features a stripped-down, five-man version of the band, with conguero Marcus Malone and drummer Doc Livingstone, both of whom would be gone before SANTANA was recorded. The jams here are lengthier and hotter than their studio counterparts, from the blistering opener \\"Jingo\\" (a showcase for Malone which makes one wish he'd stayed around a bit longer) and the jaw-droppingly prefaced version of \\"Persuasion\\" to the inevitable - but still tasty - \\"Soul Sacrifice.\\" Most of these pieces, however, would never appear on a Santana studio album, and I'm quite confused as to why. Gregg Rolie's evocative handling of \\"As the Years Go Passing By,\\" the sliding ensemble performance of \\"Chunk-a-Funk\\" and the psychedelic fury of \\"Conquistadore\\" make for what seem like sure-fire cuts from a band celebrated for its onstage flights. Carlos Santana has seldom if ever played with more flash, and the entire band's level of musicianship is exceptional throughout - though \\"Freeway\\" does get a bit long. Fans of the early, grooving Santana will certainly want this set, and all live album enthusiasts are encouraged to give it a spin. Great stuff from a very young and talented band!
B000MNP2K8|1.0|I now have two copies of the Casino Royal DVD and neither will play in my brand new Sony 400 disc changer. The product divisions at Sony have their heads so far up their own A...s that their products are not even compatible with each other. This issue is not isolated to the one movie. <br /> <br />The recommendation is, if it says Sony on the disk, don't buy it. It isn't worth the hassle since most places won't return a DVD or at best will only replace it with the same defective copy.
B000MV9026|5.0|I usually don't give this much information on reviews.  I know nothing about left-wing or right-wing propoganda or Hollywood moral compasses but here is my review of what I saw.  The color is awesome and the characters are adorable.  The music was terrific and I saw nothing that a child could not see while sitting alone unless you have a child with serious understanding problems. It is an animated cartoon movie that tells the story of a young penguin who can't sing like the others, but he can dance.  This makes him a misfit in a world where a singing voice is required to find a mate. One day the little penguin called Mumble, meets up with some type of bird that eats fish and penguins.  The bird is tagged on his left leg and the penguin inquires about the tag.  The bird explains it as \\"Alien abduction\\" and at the last minute the penguin is saved from getting eaten by them.   He's driven from his pack because he's different but he meets up with some blue penguins (they character tag them with accents like Mexicans)  The blue penguins consider him to be cool and he fits in with them.  The problem arising with all of the penguins is the lack of enough fish to eat. Mumble decides he will go out to sea and find out what's happening to the fish.  He ends up beached in a populated area and then put in captivity in a zoo.  One day a little girl taps on his window and he starts to dance.  This leads to publicity and requests to let him go back to the wild.  Environmentalists  put a monitor on him to track where he goes.  Then they find the habitat of all of the hungry penguins.  Then humans arrive on the scene.  Public issues over the welfare of the penguins leads to the humans leaving the area where they live and the fish become abundant once more. The way it is all done is brilliant.  When Mumble is caught it is told in the point of view of one who is abducted by aliens.  It's a thought-provoking storyline. It's worth owning in my opinion.  <br />
B000M5AJQS|4.0|Martin Scorsese is unquestionably one of the grand masters of american film and no one deserves to have an oscar sitting on their desk more than he.  But, of course, Scorsese really should have won for Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, or Goodfellas, and the multiple wins for this film seem rather clearly to be belated recognition by the industry for total career achievement.  This is a decent, entertaining picture, but it is not going to go down in history as one of his best, I think, or one of the best pictures of recent years.    The acting is all quite excellent as you would expect from this perhaps too overloaded cast: it almost feels like overkill with all the great actors crammed into this movie in sometimes rather small parts.  Damon is surprisingly good, capitalizing well on his inherent charming slickness, and Walhberg stands out, though he is on screen too rarely.  DiCaprio does a nice job, except that I think sometimes the pressure to have him play \\"vulnerable\\" and soul-searching ran counter to the moments of the narrative: that no one believes him to be the cop, given the visibly conflicted nervous way he reacts to pressure or violence, is a bit preposterous.  The basic storyline, which is almost exactly the same, scene for scene, as in Infernal Affairs, is a pretty neat one, with a lot of nice reversals and twists, though anyone would have to admit that it is a rather unrealistic and implausible series of developments in either movie.  But, somehow, for me, this film just ultimately didn't really all come together despite all the positive elements put into it.  Perhaps because I had seen the original version of this tale, the specific changes and updates made to it in Monahan's script to make things \\"Scorsesian\\" seemed to stand out too much and come off as weirdly mannered and formulaic.  In the end, I had this peculiar feeling like I had just seen almost an imitation Scorsese crime film put together by someone else out of scenes or moments or stylistic flavors from his previous ones, pasted onto the Infernal Affairs framework.  It may be that, after the mixed reception and financial disappointments of his most recent, more personal projects, a calculated decision was made to return to safer ground, to gangland loyalties in a heavily ethnic urban environment, and thus maybe even Scorsese's heart wasn't totally into this project; while certainly there's an energy here, the technical work doesn't seem quite as inspired or careful as some of his other work.  It may also be that, after living with the Sopranos for years and all the Scorsese wanna-be mob pictures, that I am as a viewer a bit burned out on some of the specific dynamics of the genre, that some of the things that originally seemed fresh and surprising are now after all these years finally turning into cliches for me.    So, certainly recommended for viewing, but the Departed is unlikely to be remembered as one of the true highlights of a fantastic career when all is said and finally done.
B000F5GNX8|4.0|\\"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\\" is one of those humorous takes on the \\"film noir\\" genre that wants to have it both ways: it makes clever comments and funny asides about the conventions of the genre (mostly via voiceover narration) while, at the same time, wanting to tell a genuinely involving \\"noir\\" story, too.  And I have to say that, for the most part, the film succeeds.  While I'm not as madly in love with this movie as many of the reviewers here, I certainly didn't feel that it's the train wreck some on this site describe it to be.  Discovering this on DVD, I found it to be slick, fun, and clever.  Robert Downey, Jr. and Val Kilmer in particular seem to be having a lot of fun.  The DVD features attractive, slickly designed menus, dynamite picture and sound, and some good extras (including a gag reel that for once is actually fun to watch).  Check this one out.
038533348X|5.0|I expected Cat's Cradle to be a hilarious satire, but what I got was a book that is mildly funny, but extremely deep with a true message about technology and science and what could become of it. One could call Cat's Cradle a number of things. Satire, philosophical literature, science fiction, even subtle horror. I call it a masterpiece. I finished it in a short period of time, but I still think about it, and what might happen in the future. <br /> <br />Slaughterhouse-Five, while great, is nothing compared to Cat's Cradle. Kurt Vonnegut was and is a brilliant man, and he will be missed, never to produce another masterpiece again. <br /> <br />If you have not read anything by this amazing author, Cat's Cradle is the perfect place to start. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK IF YOU ARE TERRIBLY DEPRESSED, as it will make you more depressed. This is one of the most depressing books that I have ever read. Nonetheless, it deserves five stars.
B000N3ST7K|4.0|Like the movies themselves, the soundtrack albums made from Quentin Tarantino's movies are always a great mix of quirky, edgy, and exciting, and the soundtrack to \\"Death Proof\\" (Tarantino's half of the \\"Grindhouse\\" double feature) is no exception.  Comprised of songs you probably never heard before and little known covers of songs you HAVE heard (along with Tarantino's usual sprinkling of dialogue excerpts from the film), \\"Death Proof, the soundtrack\\" will entertain you with its 16 bracing selections.  I had a lot of fun with this and I bet you will, too.
B000MNP2K8|5.0|Back before Timothy Dalton took over from Roger Moore, and the persistent rumors about Pierce Brosnan were all over the tabloids, I was disappointed, but thought Dalton's Bond was different and I still enjoyed both of his turns in the British Secret Service.<br /><br />Then came Pierce.<br /><br />I thought this was casting GOLD.  And while the Brosnan Bond films all did well, and were (by and large) fun and exciting, the series as a whole really had been getting stale.  Initially the thought of firing Brosnan in favor of somebody new and fresh was an act of outright lunacy.  It seemed even more so when it was announced the new Bond would be blonde actor Daniel Craig.  Let me OFFICIALLY renounce my previous observations and accept Craig as hands down my favorite Bond from this point on.  The only thing now that will ruin the most successful movie franchise of all-time is a poorly written plot.<br /><br />From virtually the opening scene, you can immediately tell there is something quite different from Bond films of the past.  Gone are the smarmy, half-witted jokes that became standard starting with 'From Russia With Love'.  Daniel Craig just isn't the type to pull that off, which is one of the chief reasons why I believe most people counted him out as even being capable of playing the role.  Instead the writers chose to give us an entirely different Bond altogether.  On the surface this borders on sacrilege, but TRUST me, it has infused some much needed adrenaline into this aging character.  Erasing all previous Bond movies and starting from scratch seems to have been a great gamble on the part of the producers.  The opening scene of any Bond film has always been one of tremendous thrills and action sequences, and I have to give credit to Daniel and everyone involved for giving us quite possibly the greatest chase scene yet--and get this: it doesn't involve a car, truck or any motorized vehicle of any kind.  Strictly on foot.  It was absolutely flawless and breath-taking.  Simply incredible.  And the film only got better from there.<br /><br />High praise, huh?  Indeed it is, and yet I wonder if I have accurately portrayed the film as good as it actually is.  All I can say is this: if you once believed that nobody could replace Sean Connery (or Roger, or Pierce or...) you owe it to yourself to see how Daniel Craig has quite literally not just taken over, but he's done it with brutal force.  If you took every actor who has played Bond over the years and while in their prime placed them side-by-side, it would be impossible not to see that Craig is the best of the bunch physically.  And he more than proves it with the action sequences.  Bond is no longer a guy who can seemingly walk through a hailstorm of automatic gunfire without so much as a hair out of place...nope, THIS Bond is the real deal who isn't afraid to get down and dirty and he DOES get hurt along the way.  A much more human Bond.<br /><br />In short, I loved it, and can't wait for the next installment.d breath-taking.  Simply incredible.

0007205236|4.0|The first thing you notice about Angela's Ashes is Frank Mcourt's ability to write in such a way that you feel like you are there in the room with him. His descriptions are incredible. They can make you feel sickened, make you laugh or make you want to cry. Mcourt masterfully explains his poverty stricken childhood in first America, then Ireland and then back to America again.  <br />    I started reading Angelas Ashes like many other people; as a mandatory book for history. I thought it would be very long and boring like many books about history and it seemed to be that way for the first few chapters. Later, as i read this book, I ended up reading more and more chapters at a time. Though it is repetetive how this poor Irish family lives in hunger while their father drinks away his wages, you begin to appreciate it and really get a feeling of how their misery feels. Because that is what their misery must have felt like; a never ending monotony of hunger and suffering. When you read this book, you feel like you've known Frankie since his birth. Mcourt ages himself in the book perfectly so that he has just the right personality from when he is born all the way to the age of 19. You travel through his life in the lanes of Limerick and share all of his experiences, whether terrible or joyous. This is a must read for anybody interested in Ireland or just for fun.
B00005JPCF|1.0|A shrill, sometimes dark, traumatizing leftist screed involving nasty religious penguins, good nonreligious younger hip-hop penguins singing about nappy hair, penguins with harems, young penguins singing about wanting each others' bodies, overfishing, dementia ... this movie is not for kids.<br /><br />The style is semi-realistic, i.e. not very cartoonish, which was strange - not a good artistic choice. You've probably seen the plot summarized already. This is not a good movie night for the whole family, unless these are the values you want to instill.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|I have been very disappointed in the swivel sweeper due to the fact that it kicks up an enormous amount of dust as it vacuums.  I need to sweep or vacuum my hardwood floors daily (two dogs, two cats), and if I use the swivel sweeper, I also have to dust the entire house.  Even a normal broom generates less dust than this thing.  So all in all, it has not saved me any time or inconvenience.  It's overpriced as well when you add in the exorbitant shipping charges.
0312323867|5.0|Few sequels live up to the first book! This book is just as good as the first! Funny and whitty. Continues the story of friendship from the first book! Would recommend for a group of girlfriends to read! Lots to discuss!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|sinceramente no lo he visto pero el trailer empieza con unos movimientos de camara increibles con el SALTO ANGEL DE VENEZUELA, si utilizaron este lugar para presentar una serie de la BBC y que escogieran una parte de Venezuela de todo el planeta tierra me hace sentir orgulloso. <br />Si empieza asi no me imagino como sera el resto de la serie. <br />Orgullo de Venezuela para el mundo.
0316010669|5.0|As a Psych minor in college I read this book to see what it had to offer. I discovered while reading it that I began remembering lectures from college that where along the same line. I think this is a great book that is very insightful. Could be read by psychology buffs or practically anyone interested in thought processes. Would recommend this book and The Tipping Point!
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I am not a fan of John Meyer's.  All of his previous singles just didn't grab me as groundbreaking or worthy of seeking out what else is on the CD.  I caught John Meyer on, of all shows, Oprah Winfrey (not something I typically get a chance to see).  He was talking to her about Waiting for the World to Change and I really liked what he was saying -- his politics behind the lyrics.  I caught him performing the song and I was hooked. To me, it sounded different than the other singles I've heard by him.  I bought the CD and I love it.  So much so, that I decided to write this review.  I just couldn't quit thinking about the songs once I quit listening.  I'm not one for song titles, so I can only tell you that i love Track 4.  There's not one song that is bad.  Each is unique and rocking.  The lyrics are introspective and I love the soul that seems to be invested in every track.  A great CD from someone that is not really a fan.  I'm curious now to see what I've been missing from this talented musician. <br />
0374105235|5.0|Great book. Easy read. This book is inspirational and a fast read. Author recounts his story of growing up in war torn country. He had to face many obstacles that no child should ever have to face in their lifetime. Would recommend to anyone of any age. Will proably reread time and again!
0763621803|5.0|We purchased this book for our 3 year old after enjoying \\"I am not tired and will not go to bed.\\"  We have enjoyed reading this book as much and it has an added perk....our very \\"fussy eater\\" now eats cloud fluff and green drops.  It was as easy as making a reference to the book one night at supper and all of the sudden he ate a whole bowl of cloud fluff and some green drops (he also tried some orange twiglets!)  The Charlie and Lola books are very imaginative and fun to read.  I highly recommend purchasing them.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|After forty years, twenty movies and five Bonds, it was reasonable to assume that the series had all the life ground out of it long ago -- how long, exactly, we could debate endlessly.  One thing, however, seemed certain: that Ian Fleming's original literary character had been washed away by a sea of cinematic silliness, giving only his name to a massive juggernaut of cheap thrills. <br /> <br />Thank god we were wrong.  At last, at long, LONG last, we finally, finally, FINALLY have the first no-B.S. Bond since \\"From Russia With Love\\".  That's longer than I've been alive.   <br /> <br />What makes this version of Casino Royale -- the third one filmed, but the only one really worth watching -- so immensely satisfying is the fact that the writers have done essentially what Jeremy Brett did for Sherlock Holmes twenty years earlier: stripped away all of the extra elements added by the movie studios and returned to the origins of the character.  Gone are the flirtations with Moneypenny, the snippy banter with Q, the stupid gadgets, the white-cat-stroking megalomaniac master villains with their doomsday weapons controlled from underwater volcano fortresses filled with armies of jumpsuited technician, and (praise god for this above all else) the women with porn-star names and \\"Oh, James!\\" repertoires.  Bye-bye to all that nonsense, as enjoyable as it once was. <br /> <br />Not to say that the action is lacking -- in fact, there are some terrific scenes in this movie, neatly combining cliffhanger thrills with down-to-earth locales.  An early chase scene involving dazzling free-running stunts is a particular standout.  But it never goes completely into fantasy land, a la Roger Moore's films.  Similarly, the plot, the villains, the violence, and even the gadgetry are well within the realm of possibility for a change.  Bond has access to the technology one might expect in the intelligence game: tracking devices, satellite uplinks and so on, but no lasers in the wristwatch or sport cars that turn into submarines. <br /> <br />Best of all, Daniel Craig is Ian Fleming's Bond in a way that no other actor ever has been -- no, not even the venerable Sean Connery.  I realize it's widely considered somewhat blasphemous to suggest that Sean was anything less than perfect in the role, but I'm saying it here.  To his credit, this is mostly the fault of the writers and producers who quickly sacrificed the Hitchcockian suspense and characterizations of \\"From Russia With Love\\" for the comic-book goofiness of \\"Goldfinger\\" and all subsequent entries.  Connery himself has called \\"FRWL\\" his favorite, and it's easy to see why: it's about the last time he was given the chance to play the character AS a character.  George \\"love-him-or-hate-him\\" Lazenby touched on it, and the unjustly underrated Timothy Dalton tried valiantly to get back to that level of acting in the series, but he was swimming hopelessly against the tide at the time.  Roger Moore never really bothered, but relied instead on his own brand of screen presence to carry him through, and Pierce Brosnan was too busy keeping his head up in a series of increasingly over-the-top explosions.  But now, with this excellent reboot of the series, Craig has the opportunity to start fresh, applying himself to the reality of Bond, instead of living up to the massive, overwhelming screen-image of what has gone before. <br /> <br />Critics of Craig's who claimed he was unfit or inappropriate for the role of James Bond have, I think, largely missed the point of the character.  He may well be the first Bond (except perhaps Connery) who was cast based on his skill as an actor rather than his potential as a matinee idol.  Certainly, he looks less like a pretty-boy movie star and more like a guy who can get the job done than most Bonds, and this is as it should be.  Bond himself, in one of the novels, resisted comparison to a movie star, claiming, \\"That's the worst insult you can pay a man.\\"  Craig's Bond deftly avoids the mistake almost universally made by the previous movies: his James Bond, like Fleming's, is a very sexy figure, not because he's handsome or charming, but because he is cold, hard, and very dangerous.  This is a man who does the British government's dirty work, and wakes up each day knowing he may have to kill someone before he sleeps again.  He's a soldier with a polish-job, a la 'My Fair Lady', to let him wear the tux and pass among the beautiful people, but all the Cary Grant charm and the Hugh Hefner lifestyle aren't who he is inside; his true passion is the work, not the women.  Craig's Bond, like Fleming's, is a man who doesn't enjoy the killing, but takes pride in doing it well. <br /> <br />And, at the end of the day, he is still: \\"Bond.  James Bond.\\" <br /> <br />
0060934913|5.0|Sure, I didn't work in New York or in any five star (or even two star) restaurants but I did spend a little over a decade in white shoes with a order pad for eight / ten  / twelve hours a day / night at a station that at any time included parties of twenty, rounds of ten, four tops, booths of families with crying kids, deuces (the dreaded \\"date\\" tables) and a counter of \\"I need this now I'm late already.\\"  I had a blast and made excellent money.  At every place I was sure to kiss up greatly to the cooks.  Treat them with respect like they were small gods with great powers.  Or more like mega gods with almighty powers.  If you got on their good side all went well for you, if you chanced not, you might as well hang up your pen and hock your uniform.  (although they'd ask for it back if they canned you)  I remember each and every cook that I worked with (chefs, that's stretching it) and as far as I can recall, jail terms, addictions, predilections, affairs, under the counter dealings, you name it, all of it was there and all fair game.  Every cook had a personality larger than life.  They cultivated it.  The unique appearance, the tattoos and piercings (at a time tattoos and piercings weren't \\"in\\") the hollering gruffness, the swearing, the throwing your orders up (literally) the pretend or real hate of you, just because you exist around the edges of their stratosphere.  It would make or break you.  And woe betide if you showed weakness in their presence.  You became in their all-seeing eyes worse than that bit of offal at the back of the walk-in that they were saving for the Tuna Surprise.  They played weakness like a violin.  And as for the coolers and the prep area and the way stuff sits and sits and sits and what ends up in the stew and chop suey special and stuffed peppers, it's better not to know.<br /><br />Reading this brought back memories of a good life, if a hard one.  I've heard it said everyone should wait tables and work retail at least once in their lives.  I agree.  It builds muscles into your character.agree.  It builds muscles into your character.
0345442989|5.0|Movie fans were thrilled that Episode I introduced Obi-Wan Kenobi's Jedi Master and wanted to know more about him and his relationship with his padawan.  This book focuses on Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan's adventures in the month leading up to The Phantom Menace.  The background for the galactic politics that rushed by us in the movie are presented here in much more detail, including the scandal surrounding Supreme Chancellor Valorum.  Senator Palpatine is active and his friend, Lt. Governor Tarkin, in involved in the plot.  We learn much more about the Trade Federation and their motivations.  And we see brief glimpses of Darth Sidious lurking in the shadows, manipulating events.  This book answered most of the questions I had after first watching Episode I.<br /><br />This book features one of my favorite Star Wars characters, Qui-Gon Jinn. It has plenty of action while being a political thriller. And this novel just about answered all of the questions I had after seeing Episode I. It serves as a lesson in galactic politics and economy. Now I understand the Trade Federation's role. This novel didn't show Maul or much of Sidious, but it shows a lot of Palpatine and others Senators, including even Bail Antilles of Alderaan. We learn what the \\"baseless accusations of corruption\\" leveled against Valorum were. And the events of the end of the novel explain why Valorum had to \\"secretly\\" send the two Jedi to Naboo in the movie. While we don't get to learn about Padme's family or past, we see Palpatine meeting the young Amidala for the first time just after she is elected Queen (after the mysterious abdication and death of the previous leader. Hmmm.) Lt. Govenor Tarkin appears in a larger role as a young friend of Palpatine's working his way up the political ladder of an Outer Rim planet. He is very antagonistic of Valorum and his connection to the plots of Palpatine is very implied. If you liked the story of Episode I and want to learn more about it, I highly recommend this book. (This book is also a prequel to Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter.)<br /><br />The excellent [[ASIN:0345435419 Shadow Hunter (Star Wars: Darth Maul)]] includes a short story at the end by James Luceno that features Darth Maul and sets up Cloak of Deception.<br /><br />I also highly recommend the following 5-star novels that are extremely relevant to the film series:<br /><br />[[ASIN:0345475739 Labyrinth of Evil (Star Wars, Episode III Prequel Novel)]]<br />[[ASIN:0345477332 Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader (Star Wars)]]<br />[[ASIN:0553574132 Shadows of the Empire (Star Wars)]]book is also a prequel to Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter.)

1416914285|1.0|As a high school teacher I am always looking for a good YA book to use as a Directed Reading Lesson for my students to get them more interested in reading for pleasure. I had heard good things about, City of Bones, so I bought it. <br /> <br />I wish I could give it a good review, but I cannot. Why? There are two reasons and I will explain them. <br /> <br />One, as a teacher, I could not in good faith say with a straight face to a parent that this book was age appropriate for *any* high school student, unless they were over 17 years old and in a Gifted and Talented program. Meaning I consider this to be an R-rated book (if we were going by movie standards).  <br /> <br />And before you label me some right-wing Bible-thumping conservative, I am the direct opposite of that. But I know what PARENTS want their *children* to read and I don't think this book is it. I think the book's target age should be 17 and up, so that lets out all my 9th, 10th and 11th (and some of my 12th) grade students. <br /> <br />And why do I think my students who are under 17 shouldn't be reading City of Bones? Because of the violence and sexual content (incest factor and  the homoerotic content). I would have a hard time explaining to any parent or my local school board why I was reading a book to my students about a boy who French-kissed his sister in a scene.  <br /> <br />And while *I* have no problem with homoerotic content in movies and books (see my other reviews *g*), I think most parents do not want their underage children reading about that topic without some discussion beforehand. And quite frankly it just isn't my job as an instructor to explain homosexuality to students, that is their parent's job.  <br /> <br />The second problem with the book besides not being able to use it in a classroom or school setting because of the above discussed problems, is that the plot lacks orginality. This is another factor I must have when I pick a book for my students. I want them to read aboutsomething exciting and *new.* <br /> <br />City of Bones is fast-paced, but its characters are all ones we've seen before. The main female character, Clary, is a cross between Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Leia from Star Wars. Just as Jace is Luke from Star Wars and Angel from Buffy. And if Simon isn't Xander from Buffy, I'll eat my hat. Plus Hodge is Giles (and a little Albus Dumbledore, complete with bird thrown in for good measure). Isabelle is Cordelia from Buffy and Alec is Draco from Harry Potter -- who is in love with Jace. Plus my favorite rip-off is Valentine, the bad guy. He's Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine all rolled in one. Get it, Palpatine = Valentine?  <br /> <br />As a huge Star Wars fan if I saw one more Star Wars reference I was going to write to George Lucas and tell him he should be getting royalities on this book! <br /> <br />So, if you were thinking of buying this book for your teenager, I would take a pass. If you were thinking of buying it for yourself and you are over 17, I would buy it with a grain of salt and know that you are not getting something new, but plots that have been used before (and much better in my opinion).
B00007J4SI|1.0|There are two performances that stand out in this set: The Op. 71 poems. The sound quality throughout is marginal (very thin old analog that makes Horowitz's muffled Third Sonata sound great), and one reviewer even said he/she thinks the piano was out of tune, which wouldn't surprise me. <br /> <br />Ponti's Scriabin is sloppy and umusical in general. Only the Op. 71 poems make this set worth getting. Start with Robert Taub's sonatas, Horowitz Plays Scriabin (on RCA and Sony), and Glemser Vol. 1.
B000JBWWRY|3.0|I don't remember ever being that taken with Peter Pan when I was younger, it certainly was never my favourite, but as I've mentioned in previous reviews, I'm collecting the special editions, and waiting (im)patiently for the ones that have already been out, and gone again. Convenient how they're releasing these special editions around every 6 years or so, just in time for the next generation to start clamouring at their parents that they want them!<br /><br />While I found Peter Pan funnier than I remember (Mr Darling, Smee, Captain Hook & the Croc), I couldn't help but see Bob Hoskins as Smee and Dustin Hoffman as Captain Hook - yes I've seen Hook way too many times! Apart from that, I noticed that, although not as much as the earlier Disney movies, there are still some references that I really don't think should be in a kids movie - the fairy dust for instance? That makes them fly? How many of you tried to jump off your garden fence or your garage when you were young? And also the fact they show John smoking what looks like very suspicious substances. But this certainly wouldn't be shown in today's very politically correct Disney. There's also some terrible stereotypes about American Indians.<br /><br />I found Wendy's voice as irritating as usual, but I definitely found it familiar, so I'm probably still remembering it from when I was young. Peter was never a favourite character of mine and like Walt Disney himself, I found it to be really cold and quite unlikable.<br /><br />This is a must for collectors, with the usual special features, although if you find yourself bored during the games, that's because they're aimed at kids. Not us old ones. Unless you fancy trying the 9x9 Suduko - I couldn't do it. The next special edition is the Jungle Book, out in the autumn, not particularly another favourite of mine, but I'm still looking forward to it.
B000GPIPVU|5.0|This entire cd is just absolutely incredible. Ray's voice is amazing, and he has the ability to make you Feel what he is singing. I love it! worth every penny and so much more!
B000005HBT|3.0|5 Stars for the great music but does anyone else hear the annoying \\"da duh duh da da\\" of someone, I assume Monk, humming or singing the notes in the background on most of the tracks?  It's not too loud but loud enough for it to be really disconcerting to me.  Seems like a real shame, to me at least - I'm taking off two stars for that.  If you're a close listener perhaps steer clear of this release (perhaps the newer editions cut out more of this?).
B000063V8U|5.0|The season really tests the intelligence of the audience by taking risks unheard of in a science fiction series. There are a few clunkers in this season (\\"Rascals\\" comes to mind), but overall, it really played with the format and took off in some bold new directions. Here are some highlights: <br /> <br />\\"Schisms\\"- A kind of UFO abduction episode, in which the crew members try to piece together missing gaps in time caused by clicking insect-like aliens who are taking away Enterprise crew members into another dimension.  <br /> <br />\\"Chain of Command\\" is brilliant not just for Patrick Stewart's harrowing performance as a torture victim, but also for Ronnie Cox as the hard-nosed substitute Captain Jellico. Not since William Windom's Matt Decker have we seen such a plausible Federation captain who does things a different way.  <br /> <br />\\"Face of the Enemy\\" is eminently re-watchable for Carolyn Seymour's brilliant performance as the cunning Romulan Commander Toreth. You can actually see how she thinks through every move on the tense attack on the Enterprise. With smart characters like these, it's really hard to hate the Romulans. Actually, you walk away respecting them even more the Federation crew. <br /> <br />We have two Klingon \\"cultural pride\\" episode with \\"Birthright\\" and its companion piece, the fascinating \\"Rightful Heir\\" with Kevin Conway (the unforgettable Doctor Haber from the old PBS miniseries \\"Lathe of Heaven\\" for those of you who grew up in the 70s) miniseries playing a Klingon version of Jesus, who fufills the prophecy a Second Coming. The episode explores the role of religion and mythology in a civilization. <br /> <br />Jonathan Frakes shines in \\"Frame of Mind,\\" another mind-bender who has Riker questioning his own sanity as he tries to wade through levels of reality, in another UFO-abduction style episode. <br /> <br />The interview with Levar Burton on the \\"making of\\" CD sent chills up my spine. Here is a fan of the old series who got to connectwith the Star Trek universe in a way few of us ever could. <br />

0767836286|1.0|Horrible.  Absolutely horrible in characters, story and atmospherics.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges' character is so inconsistent and contradictory that he is not only unbelievable, but grating.  The story fails in every way possible.  The bad guy's plan depends not only upon being able to predict (not just manipulate) actions of multiple characters, but to intricately synchronize them, even when they have only indirect access.  Even worse, their plan depends upon Bridges' character making critical inferences on a precise schedule.  But the cardinal sin is that script has as a key element of the bad guys' plan an ultra-sophisticated attempt to negate/disrupt another key element of that plan, that is, that Bridges' character by a stroke of luck/coincidence combined with a flash of brilliance will thwart the bad guys' effort to sabotage their own plan.<br /><br />Pacing and other atmospherics can overcome substantial flaws in the script, but in this movie, they are so amateurish that they emphasize and exacerbate those problems.
B000N6TX1I|2.0|I agree with J. Sorsby's review.  This film was simply aweful, and I don't say that often about films, as I usually find something good to say about the films I watch, because I am very particular to the films I'm interested in.  Subject material (or genre) is usually the only criteria I care about.  If I'm interested in the subject material, I'll check out the film.  I generally like sci-fi and/or apocalyptic films, so I checked this out because this film was billed as the \\"new Millenium's 'Blade Runner'\\".  Hogwash.  The only thing that would make this in the vein of \\"Blade Runner\\" would be the noir dystopia post-apocalyptic setting.  If you've seen the TV series \\"Dark Angel\\", you get the gist of the environment this is set in.<br /><br />However, here's the deal with this film (and story).  Instead of Blade Runner's Replicants, this story deals with the infertilization of human kind and then the sudden miracle of a illegal immigrant being pregnant and then giving birth.  Of course the police state is very fascist, and the heroes need to smuggle this woman and her baby to some sort of human experimental organization.<br /><br />The film is only 110 minutes long and only 10-15 minutes of the film near the end is worth watching.  The action scene in the streets and buildings of a bombed out city block or two.  But that's not what really ticked me off about the film.  Believe it or not, it's one of the extras on the DVD.  The 27 minute featurette \\"The Possibility of Hope.\\"  This featurette features about every prominent European leftist telling the viewer just how bad and evil individualism, globalization, capitalism, and ownership of personal property is.  One of the main speakers is a \\"Philosophy and Culture critic\\".  Now if that don't tell you something, nothing will.  Someone paid to come up with and say anything and everything about how bad humanity is.  It was a disgusting piece to put on a DVD as an extra.  Even though it supposedly tied into the film somewhat, the piece was totally one-sided.  That's propaganda folks...and I ain't buyin'.  Not one voice of dissent in the piece.

B00005JL3A|4.0|I really liked this movie. The sets were excellent, the acting decent, the action very good. I never played the game so I came into it totally unbiased. This is definately on my top ten list of movies to watch on cold winter days when I'm able to curl up in front of the tv and enjoy myself.<br /><br />You've already got the basic story line from other folks and apparently this is a 'love it' or 'hate it' type. Maybe if you can see the movie while putting aside the game you'll have a better time. Just sit back and enjoy the story and the action. You'll do just fine.
B000JJS8TM|3.0|The first complete sentences out of my mouth as a child were the lyrics to \\"Here Comes the Sun.\\"  Today, I have over 3000 cds, but there is no other group that comes close the Beatles (bet I'm the first one with that epiphany).  Regardless of how cliche nearly everything written about them is, I still feel a personal connection whenever I listen to any of their music...it's almost as if I am experiencing it for the first time as no one else has--it is music that still--after years of playing it OVER AND OVER--sends shivers up and down my spine.  Their music clearly has that intimate ability.  <br /> <br />\\"Love\\" is a fantastic cd and well worth getting.  Some of the \\"mashups\\" are interesting and it is fun to hear reworkings of songs that are ingrained in my consciousness.  The most exciting part of the recording is...the recording (as many have already said).   <br /> <br />So, why not 5 stars?  Don't get me wrong...I really enjoy this disc.  But it was so clearly created for a \\"spectacle,\\" like Cirque. Every break between the songs has this airy \\"ahhhhh ahhhhh\\" that is so obviously put in for the set changes.  I can almost see the performance for it in my head...and I have never been within 100 miles of such a performance (and hopefully never will).  That took away some of that \\"intimacy.\\"  Additionally, I was frustrated at the minimal mixing--which mainly is at the beginning and the end of the song--with the center unchanged.  The choice of songs is unexciting.  While some of my favorites are in there, some of my least are as well (do I really need to hear Octopus and Yesterday again?).  There are some trancendent moments (Strawberry fields, within you, that glass onion mix, a day in the life, fixing a hole...).  I also ended up liking songs that I had not liked much before simply because NOW I could hear the music! (Lucy in the Sky, Elenor Rigby).  The POTENTIAL for this cd is HUGE.  Imagine if this was done purely for musical reasons, rather than for an enormouscommercial enterprise.  Regardless of the heartwarming story about how much George liked Cirque, this aspect of it ruined the disc for me.   <br /> <br />I guess the main reason I gave it three stars is because I am a little angry....why on earth haven't their recordings been cleaned up like this?  ALL OF THEM!!!  Every time I finish the disc, I feel frustrated. Re-releasing their catalog with this sound quality would be like hearing the Beatles all over again.  I REALLY hope they do at some point.
B00005JPFQ|4.0|To clarify, I've never read this exact comic. But I think one could assume that this was a good comic/movie rendering, a simple plot without being old and recycled. The Mephistopheles character seeks out and tricks the hero, a daredevil motorcyclist from the carnival named Johnny Blaze, and he is subsequently sent to fight against other rival \\"baddies\\" of the underworld in the service of the Bug Guy. So in a sense he becomes the devil's slave even in a fight against evil.<br /><br />The effects are great. The transformation of the motor-cycle and the hero's head into a burning skull are very convincing. Also noteworthy is the effect whereby he can use his power to cause a human-being to come face to face with all the evil things he has done in his life. The action is somewhat over the top, but mostly in the zone for a super-natural thriller. Johnny is invincible when he is the Ghost Rider, of course, and fighting against virtually indestructible foes will cause major damage to the landscape.<br /><br />Casting was superb. Cage was a great pick for the Johnny Blaze, the understated soft-spoken daredevil. The love story aspect is a little flat, hence the 4-stars. Although both women playing Johnny's girl-friend are picture-perfect as ideal comic book babes, Eva Mendes isn't given much in the way of a script which is the main reason her character loses in the depth department. So it's no Spiderman II story-wise. Sam Elliot is tremendously fun to watch if you like him because he is basically playing Sam Elliot; he's pretty much reprising his last 6 or so tough guy cowboy roles, which he always does masterfully.
0060512806|4.0|I really wanted to give this book a 5-star rating. I enjoyed most of it more than most books I've read, and the enjoyment it provides is quite unlike any other book I have ever read. But I found a few glaring flaws (not those most are bothered by, it seems) that made it impossible to give it such a rating. Having said that, DO read this book. I don't care whether you know anything about modular arithmetic or computer science; everything is explained lucidly enough that you don't need to have any background. I have to admit that I probably enjoyed the math-heavy sections of the book (mostly those centering around Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse) more than most would , but that's okay, because those aren't even the best parts of the book. The complete realization of characters like Bobby Shaftoe are what make this book seem so vivid. <br /> <br />Having said that, his characterization can also be his weakest point; more specifically, his characterization of women. I am not the type of nitpicky PC-obsessed reader who normally lodges complaints like this, but there is not a single believable or fully realized female character in this book. Some seem to have been thrown in as an afterthought (such as Beryl), and play such a minimal role that they easily could have been left out. Others are crucial to the plotline, and could have been very interesting characters. America/Amy in particular disappointed me; it didn't seem like Stephenson had a firm grasp on her character, and as a result I found her later actions in the novel hard to swallow after her initial set-up. <br /> <br />In direct relation to the female problem this book has is its romance problem. Stephenson's descriptions both of sexual attraction and sex itself struck me as stiff and awkward. I found myself wanting to skip ahead through these parts, rather than savoring them as the culmination of tension established between characters. <br /> <br />I would be remiss to dedicate this review to criticism, though; its 910 pages flew by for me, and now that I'm finished with it I'm headed straight out the door to purchase another of Mr. Stephenson's books. It delighted the Alan Turing fan and discrete math nerd in me, and awakened an interest in history that I didn't think I possessed. It made me chuckle and chortle and long for Captain Crunch. It's a heck of a book.
0316010669|1.0|This book is more of a collection of short lackluster stories that have no real bearing with the true purpose of this book (even if there are any bearings, the author is done a poor job of articulating them) <br /> It's too late for me but you please save yourself some time and money  by not buying this book <br />
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|*no spoilers*<br /><br />The film is a very magical experience. If you like movies like \\"The Others,\\" \\"The Six Sense,\\" or \\"The Usual Suspects,\\" you'd love this film.<br /><br />Story:<br /><br />A magician Eisenheim \\"The Illusionist\\" (Edward Norton) creates turmoil with his extravagant but curious magic show in 19th century Vienna. While performing a magical act in a theater, he finds out that his volunteer for the magical act is a lost lover (Jessica Biel) but she is about to marry the arrogant and dangerous \\"soon to be king\\" prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell). Love comes again between them, but I won't be easy for them to escape from the evil aristocrat and his sidekick the Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti).<br /><br />Review:<br /><br />It is a brilliant movie in almost every sense. The film takes you back to the 19th century and it does an excellent job doing it. \\"The Illusionist\\" was beautifully shot with excellent custom design, art direction and photography. The filter used for the movie was a bit overdone I believe. The special effects--the magic acts in the theater--were about average. But all these technical factors become secondary to the most important part of the film and that is the story. The plot is paramount in this film. We cared for the illusionist and his lover, their struggles and their dreams. The acting is another highlight in this film. All the main characters are believable. Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti have good chemistry on screen.<br /><br />The ending will shock you, but in a good way we believe. After watching this movie you'll realize how clever the writers were.<br /><br />The Verdict:<br /><br />The title says it all, it's all illusion. \\"The Illusionist\\" is a very clever and enjoyable film where the real magic is in its plot and its ending.

B00005JPKE|5.0|*no spoilers*<br /><br />Clint Eastwood gave us history, patriotism and courage in his 2006 film \\"Flags of our Fathers.\\" He is back now to show us a different insight from that important battle, but this time we get to see behind enemy lines. The Battle of Iwo Jima is now shown from the Japanese perspective in his new film \\"Letters from Iwo Jima.\\" We recommend this film due to its excellent plot, realism, acting and drama.<br /><br />Brief story:<br /><br />The beaches look calm and peaceful in present day Iwo Jima. Groups of Japanese scientists are investigating a network of tunnels that their soldiers dug up before the battle of Iwo Jima in 1945. Suddenly they find something interesting in the soil and begin to dig up. As they dig, the movie takes us back in time to 1945, days before that fateful battle.<br /><br />Japanese General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) arrives at the island and begins to plan new strategies to protect it against the American occupation. Unfortunately, many of his troops believe that this battle is lost. They are going against a better equipped and more powerful military force. The General also knows that the war is not going well for his country--he is bombarded with bad radio news from the mainland about the war--but that doesn't stop him from doing his duty honorably. The battle begins and all the Japanese soldiers shift to surviving mode.<br /><br />Review:<br /><br />Clint Eastwood is back with another epic film where we witness the crude reality of World War II once again. This time around, we get to see the war through the eyes of Japanese soldiers. These brave men who sacrificed everything and fought until the end to protect their island. A small island indeed, but yet crucial for both sides, especially for the Land of the Rising Sun. The Japanese side gives us history, patriotism and courage of its own. We see some of their motives, fears and dreams through flashbacks--something that Clint used heavily in \\"Fathers\\"--but done better this time. We get to understand what the word \\"honor\\" means to them. Although these two enemies are from different parts of the world, they share similarities like; insecurity, fear of the unknown, patriotism, rage against their enemy, but they also share compassion for one another and strong family values.<br /><br />The acting is what makes this movie very realistic. Ken Watanabe gives us an excellent performance as the real-life General Kuribayashi. He is a man of honor who must fight his enemy as well as his own demons--his character reminds us a little bit of Katsumoto from The Last Samurai.<br /><br />The look and feel of the film is virtually the same as \\"Fathers\\" where Clint used a dark--almost black & white color--filter. The battle scenes are shown with intensity. The camera work is dynamic and the overall photography is impressive--something that you would definitely expect from a Clint Eastwood film.<br /><br />Unfortunately the movie suffers from the same illness as \\"Fathers.\\" Both movies feel longer than they really are due to the draggy editing and talky moments--we believe that the use of flashbacks is something that Clint needs to minimize.<br /><br />The Verdict:<br /><br />The Battle of Iwo Jima is remembered as a great victory for America--and rightly so--but there is more to tell. \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" gives us the opportunity to see beyond the American version by focusing on the Japanese one.

B0004Z33EG|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. For several years now, my dad and I get together and watch movies like Rambo, Predator, Terminator etc. Anyways, this has been a classic for all of those years, and still holds true. One of things that I found interesting about this film is it's creepy undertone. The way those cops obsessively chase and threaten John Rambo is a mysterious journey into the heart of violent obsession. The action is also top notch, with enough explosions and gun fights to make any adreanline junkie happy. Another strong point is the acting by Stallone which is superb, and the score by Goldsmith that helps make the film classic. <br /> <br />Definately a milestone.
0553804677|5.0|Locke Lamora is a brilliant thief and a legend in his own lifetime as \\"The Thorn of Camorr\\".   He, and the rest of his gang, The Gentlemen Bastards, steal only from the rich - but they aren't quite Robin Hood, and the underworld they move in is a brutal place to exist. <br /> <br />This is a complex, multi-layered novel that charts the life of Locke and his friends until they embark on a sting that will, unexpectedly, change their lives forever.  I very much enjoyed this novel and I am eagerly awaiting the next instalment in this projected seven book series.  This novel means that the author will need to keep a high standard for the rest of the series if it is to be at least as good as this book. <br /> <br />If you enjoyed this novel you may also enjoy \\"Mistborn: The final Empire\\"  by Brandon Sanderson which is another underworld/thief fantasy novel that is very well written. <br />
B000MCH5P4|5.0|An excellent movie dealing with globalization, elaborating on the effect of one incident innocently performed by a person, and how such incident would effect so many around the world...in fact, how such incident would effect the whole world and history for that matter. All actors have performed perfectly in a well directed movie that is freshly objective. A definite eye opener.
B000MNP2KI|2.0|First let me say i really like the new bond,I've always liked Craig,he does nothing to hurt this movie,but man what happend there has never been a bond movie I didnt like untill now,theres a good chase seen near the begining but after that its off to a poker tournament for 45min. or more..I dont understand the lack of action and the lack of any gadgets.Ok some might defend this and say well this is a new type of bond movie...I say B.S.When we watch a bond movie we like action,some hot bond girls,some gadgets and a save the world theme..With this movie you get none of that,zero.I dont understand all the great reviews,in a nutshell its really boring!
B000N3ST9I|5.0|What a killer CD. That makes two in a row for Machine Head. This CD is filled with heavy riffs and some great guitar harmonies. Robb's voice sounds great here. From growling & screaming to actual singing & soft vocals. This is also possibly the best Dave McClain has sounded since he joined MH so long ago. The drum work is awesome. All & all a great CD. Production is top notch. The best song is \\"Wolves\\".    My only small nitpick is that we didn't get the DVD & bonus track(cover of Metallica's Battery) like Japan & the UK did. I imported from Amazon Japan. Its a region free DVD for those who are curious.
B000HIVQK8|5.0|Para aquellos quienes tenemos la version en CD de 1991 de este disco, podremos apreciar una mejor calidad en el sonido; y la presentacion en  box set es impecable, digna de pertenecer a este mundo material. El DVD no ofrece gran cosa pero lo poco que tiene es respetable y se agradece por las imagenes ineditas que presenta, la version en vivo de \\"Give Me Love...\\", y la version alternativa de \\"Miss 0'Dell\\". Pero eso es todo. <br /> <br />El verdadero valor de esta edicion del \\"Living In The Material World\\" son los bonus tracks que tiene. No la vas a encontrar en ningun lado, salvo tengas los discos de vinilo de 45RPM, pero si eres menor de 30, dudo que lo tengas, a menos que sean de algun pariente mayor que tu. Es material importante, y mucho aun si eres coleccionista. El unico error fue no incluir Bangladesh, incluyen el lado B de ese single. Es muy probable que lo tengan pendiente para otra entrega. Eso espero. <br /> <br />Como dato adicional podria decir que nos estan presentando la actuacion que hizo George con Clapton en Japon por partes. Lo hicieron en el 2004 en el Dark Horse Box Set y lo hacen ahora en esta edicion. Creo que ya es hora que nos alcanzen el concierto completo en formato DVD. Muy pocos la tienen, y me incluyo en ese grupo. Piensen POR FAVOR en las nuevas generaciones. En especial en aquellas que nacieron despues de la separacion de The Beatles y la muerte de Lennon.
B00005JPCF|4.0|I adore penguins, so of course I couldn't miss this movie. I saw it in the theaters and bought it when it came out on DVD. Really cute story. Some plot holes perhaps, but it was adorable enough to make up for it. Only reason I gave it 4 stars was some of the music was too \\"hip-hopy\\" for me. Otherwise, it was great. <br /> <br />A must for penguin lovers everywhere!
141694740X|5.0|Laugh out loud, turn some pages and laugh out louder. In the process,  you'll come away lighter and more aware of those behaviors that keep you stuck. There were moments when I actually thought that Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo had tapped into my brain and knew all the reasons I had personally used to explain a guy's behavior. Some of my typical excuses ranged from \\"Oh, he's so busy at work...it's hard to call.\\" to \\"maybe he's intimidated by me\\". Alas fellow reader this funny, insightful book communicates a direct and simple message which lies directly in its title. I no longer wander in the murky land of excuses. I have more clarity regarding my actions and a guy's behavior. I have peace of mind and I'm smiling! The awareness is truly liberating.  <br />  <br />Fortunately, \\"awareness\\" has arrived in many different packages lately. Another wonderful book \\"How to Create A Magical Relationship\\" by Ariel & Shya Kane, has led me to believe that possibilities for relationships are actually out there! I've opened myself up to dating, to intimacy and to new people entering my life. These two books together opened my eyes and my world. They are a winning combo!

1416914285|3.0|Having read Cassie's fanfiction religiously, I expected a book that was witty, deep, and fun. City of Bones is a tepid version of what I expected. The continuity is lacking, the prose not as funny (perhaps because Cassie was limited only to what she could come up with, instead of sampling everyone else's funnies). The characters don't have depth. The incest thing should have been played out more (I certainly didn't see them falling in love with each other...) Great use of old fantasy themes, but both Cassie and Holly have disappointed me. DV was better than this! Perhaps my bar has been set too high.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|This film is based on Chris Gardner's autobiography ... it is a true-story. Sooo ...  <br /> <br />Ignore the one and two-star ratings which claim this film is \\"depressing.\\" Foremost, the film is uplifting ... it is (forgive the cliche) a film which clearly illustrates the \\"triumph of the human spirit.\\" It would have been a gross-misstep to \\"downplay\\" Gardner's challenges and hardships: this is what makes the ending as powerful as it is. Moreover, this film underscores that which is all-too-overlooked in our society: the unconditional love of a father for his child. Hollywood loves mothers, but often vilifies fathers ... it is refreshing to see a turn in the trend. And, that Will Smith's own son plays his on-screen son ... it is a tribute to fathers and sons everywhere. <br /> <br />The quality of the film itself is worthy of a four or five-star rating. The cinematography, the soundtrack, the acting (watch for a cameo by the real Chris Gardner at the film's conclusion), and the film-extras: all are near immaculate. Hopefully, this will help allay the fears that the one and two-star ratings may have instilled. And, also allow me to say, that I am not a fan of mainstream film ... but I did enjoy this honest portrait of an incredible man.   <br /> <br />When you purchase this film, be certain to watch the film-extra \\"The Man Behind the Movie: A Conversation with Chris Gardner.\\" Though the feature-film is entirely self-contained (you do not need this documentary-short to explain any aspect of the film), it is a treat to see the real-life Chris Gardner and glean some insight into this man's commitment to attaining the \\"American Dream\\" for his son (which was still possible in '81). <br /> <br />For a bit of fun, also check-out the extra \\"Inside the Rubik's Cube.\\" You will be stunned to see what a cult-phenomenon this \\"toy\\" remains even today!! <br /> <br />Watch this film if you have an interest in \\"triumph over adversity,\\" 1980's culture, or the oft-maligned, very-necessary role of fathers in our life.  <br /> <br />Suggested Reading: Gardner, Chris. The Pursuit of Happyness. New York: Amistad, 2006.
0618551050|4.0|There was a time when I was a ravenous reader of science books. I was fascinated by Quantum Mechanics and Relativity, marveling at the strange way reality worked at the very large, the very small and the very fast. I wondered if I would live to witness the completion of the `Grand Unification Theory'. I dreamed of a desktop quantum computer with true artificial intelligence. Unfortunately AI has been a huge bust and, as the author points out, physics has basically stalled for the last three decades (which is all of my adult life). The more science books I read the more they seemed the same and when String Theory came along the new physics became so detached from reality that I completely lost interest and moved on to other things.<br /><br />Science has been so successful because it has generally adhered to the scientific method. One of the most important demonstrations of a theories strength is its falsifiability. Unfortunately String Theory cannot be falsified because it makes no predictions. The author writes, \\"A scientific theory that makes no predictions and therefore is not subject to experimentation can never fail, but such a theory can never succeed either\\" The argument is that String Theory is a whole new paradigm that breaks the conventions of the scientific method. Lee Smolin's critique of the culture of physicists working on String Theory is extremely candid and blunt. He accuses them of exaggerating successes, downplaying failures and engaging in groupthink that produces an insulated \\"we-feeling\\" of solidarity. As the author described the situation it reminded me of the ultimate dysfunctional environment, the Bush administration. Then Mr. Smolin dropped the bomb, coming right out and comparing adherence to String Theory to the Bush administration in their rush to war over WMD's. ouch.<br /><br />The real strength of science is its ability to self correct. Unfortunately when a theory is non-falsifiable arguing against it can be like trying to box smoke. The author's larger critique is against the U.S. educational system that rewards lock step mentality and promotes physicists who can garner the most grants over those with unique or unconventional ideas. The technically proficient researcher is rewarded while the visionary or \\"Seer\\" is marginalized and theoretical physics is left floundering.<br /><br />This is not an easy book to get through. It's over 400 pages and much of it deals with theoretical physics on extra dimensions, m-branes, properties of black holes and a host of other topics that can leave the readers head spinning. Rather than approaching a unified theory, string theory seems to just show the immense distance left to go. If string theory turns out to be a dead end it's back to the drawing board and the question is, what's next? This was a depressing book because I like to imagine science as divorced from petty politics and greed. My idealized vision is of researchers who are driven by nothing more than the quest to find the truth wherever it may lie. The author shatters that image even accusing department heads of flat out racism and sexism in holding down blacks and woman as inferior researchers. In the end the author maintains an optimism that science is still the best system for divining truth because it generally avoids becoming ideologically driven but String Theory has clearly put strains on the system.The author's larger critique is against the U.S. educational system that rewards lock step mentality and promotes physicists who can garner the most grants over those with unique or unconventional ideas.

B00005MP58|5.0|I came across this BBC version as I was about to purchase the 2005 big screen version.  After reading the reviews, I was compelled to purchse this DVD instead.  I couldn't be happier.  This is an interpretation that captures Austen's world beautifully.  The length of the movie allows for wonderful character development.  The actors are not as overtly beautiful as the 2005 production, but seem more true to their characters.  If for no other reason, see it for the scenery.  The named estates are all gorgeous but Pemberley is breathtaking.  This movie is a treasure.
0007205236|3.0|In Frank McCourt's book, Angela's Ashes, he shows the world the conditions that the Irish people had to live in, and the fact that they would do anything to survive. He does so with many different stories from his childhood and some of these stories are charming and even funny. Yet at the same time, all of these stories are similar in that they show the povery in Limerick and after awhile, reading about the same idea becomes very repetitive and boring.  <br />Frank McCourt does a very good job of describing the book, and by the end of it, I felt as if I would know my way around Limerick if I were to visit. At the same time, McCourt almost has too many descriptions and will go as far as to mention everything that happens every day, which becomes very boring. Although I sympathized with Frank, especially when his father did nothing but drink the dole money, I became bored very quickly with the constant mentioning of it. Although his book was very boring at times, his descriptions of the living conditions got my attention and made me realize how lucky we have it here in America. The constant fight against the cold and hunger was heart wrenching and I could not believe Frankie and his brothers lived through it.  <br />If you decide to pick this book up, be prepared for the repetitive nature of the stories and the overly descriptive writing. All in all, the book was very monotonous and even hard to read at times. But if you read carefully, you will find short, charming and even brilliant insights into the world of Frank McCourt that will make you laugh and even cry. All you have to do is find these stories.
B000MXPE7O|2.0|Potential viewer be warned.  This is a confusing, dull, pointless, badly cast(Jolie) film.  But the worst sin is that the filmmakers had the conceit to stretch this thing out to 2 hours and 48 minutes!  Good production values are the only reason I gave this 2 instead of 1 stars.
B000FQ4M58|2.0|Firstly having made BAT 1 it was always going to be a miracle to expect that effort could ever be repeated. <br /> <br />BAT 2 is OK but doesnt even come close to the sheer power of BAT 1. <br />BAT 3 is Meat singing already released cover versions of Steinman songs tagged with some Desmond Child attempts to string an album together. Its OK again but it sure as hell aint BAT 1. Knowing most of the songs already doesnt help. Its deflating and you cant help but to compare with other versions. <br /> <br />BAT 1 takes the listener on an emotional rollercoaster packed with classic track after classic track sung with Meatloafs voice towering over the songs like his life depended on it. Even today its a sensational listen. <br /> <br />BAT 3 sees Meatloaf trying his heart out. You can hear the passion in his voice, giving these songs the best chance he could give them and frankly he does a great job. Whats missing are truely great NEW songs and the hand of Jim Steinman. BAT 1 has contrast and depth BAT 2 and to an even  greater extent BAT 3 sounds to \\"try hard\\" and just is not convincing. <br /> <br />In my view BAT 3 should never have been attempted without full Steinman involvement. No Steinman to me means quit while your ahead.   <br /> <br />Its a shame...2 out of 3 Aint Bad, 3 out of 3 is.  <br />
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|I bought this cd several months ago and have not stopped listening to it! I got to see the girls perform in NC and it was awesome. They sang every song from this cd and more! I love them so much! They are fantastic!
B000060MWU|1.0|I love David Lynch.  To be honest, he could properly poop in a DVD case and I'd give it 4 stars.  This movie, however, is terrible.   There's no tangent plot, no likeable characters, no nothing.  The first viewing of this ended with me and a friend concluding, \\"I'd like to watch the rest of the movie, but I don't care.\\"  The 2nd viewing felt like a marathon in self-control and patience.  This is an awful movie.
B00005V1B1|5.0|Funny thing about Camel. I started looking into them at a friend's suggestion at the end of last summer. Then one day I was listening to a medley from THE SNOW GOOSE on YouTube and my mum walks up behind me and says, \\"Who is that?\\" I tell her it's Camel. \\"Oh my God, I haven't heard them in ages!\\" Turns out Camel were one of her favourite bands back in the 70s. She had four of their LPs on vinyl: MIRAGE, THE SNOW GOOSE, BREATHLESS, and RAIN DANCES - the very four I had decided I needed to get myself, coincidentally enough. Since she had never gotten around to upgrading her Camel albums to CD, I had never heard any of it before, but I ended up discovering it on my own anyway.<br /><br />And I'm glad I did too. MIRAGE was the first disc I sought out, and I know of very few albums that conjure a more distinct, cohesive atmosphere than the dream-like mist that pervades this one. A bracing \\"Freefall\\" opens the set, a song whose multiple time and dynamic changes place the album squarely in the prog camp right from the get-go. Next comes the soporific instrumental \\"Supertwister\\", a showcase for Andy Latimer's flute playing, which acts as a delicate counterpart to the \\"dirtier\\" stylings of, say, Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson. Most of MIRAGE is instrumental really - the lyrics are few and far between, and delivered in a sleepy croon that only contributes to the hazy soundscape suggested by the cover artwork.<br /><br />Side I of the original vinyl concludes with what may be my favourite single entry (not counting THE SNOW GOOSE) in the Camel canon, the Tolkien-inspired \\"White Rider\\" suite. A musical impression of Gandalf the Grey's triumphant rebirth as Gandalf the White, the tune incorporates ambient keyboard passages, martial rhythms, galloping instrumentals, and ethereal woodwinds to evoke a true vision of Middle-earth. Seldom have I heard a better piece of progressive rock.<br /><br />Side II features another instrumental, \\"Earthrise\\", that continues in the mold establishedby Side I and gives the musicians a chance to strut their stuff - Andy Latimer's immediately recognizable guitar licks (shades of Dave Gilmour) and Pete Bardens' elegant keyboards especially stand out. And last but not least comes the other candidate for my single favourite Camel song, the twelve-minute \\"Lady Fantasy\\" suite. Opening with a suitably bombastic blast of keyboards and drum fills, \\"Lady Fantasy\\" calls to mind the Doors in its organ-tinged verses and progresses through three movements and a good half-dozen major themes, alternating some of the softest, dreamiest moments on the album with some of the loudest and most intense. Another masterpiece.<br /><br />Camel were never very popular, which is a damn shame, because they deserve a much wider audience than just progheads. If you'd like to delve into their uniquely dreamy brand of musical magic, MIRAGE would be a great place to start.
B000GFLKF8|2.0|INSIDE MAN - Russian menus, audio in Russian or English, subtitles in Chinese or Chinese<br /><br />And you guessed it. I'm still watching DVDs we brought from China. This one, for example, stars Denzel Washington and Jodiet Foster.<br /><br />I have no reason to doubt it is as advertised, but I only lasted 15 minutes. The English audio was a bit distorted, no subtitles, and I'm sorry to report that Mr Washington developed a case of high-speed mumbles here. And, after all, it is only a bank hostage movie. Hard to care. Sorry folks.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|I saw \\"Miss Potter\\" at the cinema and thoroughly enjoyed it.  With beautiful scenery, moments to laugh out loud, times to cry, and a few delightful animations, \\"Miss Potter\\" takes us through the joys and frustrations of being a talented female author and illustrator in London at the turn of the century but being unrecognized as such by her own mother.  I would heartily recommend this film!
B000A7S4B0|4.0|I love the first album but the second one really disappointed me.  Probably cause my expectations were so high. This cd hardly sounds like the same band but I love it.  BRMC take on a much more laid back acoustic sound and they do it well.
B0007Y08QA|4.0|*** This comment may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />\\"The Machinist\\" is a very interesting film with a simply stunning performance from Christian Bale as Trevor - what he did was amazing and I mean not only his physical transformation that by itself was a real sacrifice an actor can commit for his Art. Besides Bale's performance, the film is masterfully directed and what is very important, clever written. It is one of few films that get under your skin and stay there. The ending was very satisfying and put all pieces of the puzzle together.<br /><br />I read and heard that the film is a combination of \\"Memento\\", \\"Fight Club\\", \\"Angel Heart\\", Insomnia\\", \\"Thinner\\", and \\"Identity\\". \\"The Machinist\\" may bring all these pictures to memory but it is a masterfully crafted and compelling study of one man's journey from his crime to the punishment where he himself was a criminal, a victim, a prosecutor, and the executioner. (Trevor read the wrong Dostoevsky's novel - he should have read \\"Crime and Punishment\\") The one film I was reminded of while watching \\"The Machinist\\" - David Cronenberg's \\"Spider\\". Both films take place in the atmosphere of confusion, paranoia, guilt, and unbearable terror and both have the unforgettable performances by Christian Bale and Ralph Fiennes as two very disturbed individuals.
B000MQC9H4|3.0|The plot is kind of unbelievable.  In one night two strangers switch houses without knowing eachother at all!!  Cameron Diaz' acting was interesting, as if she just had begun her acting career.  Jude's two daughters in the movie were totaly freaky (\\" 'elo Amanda' \\", and were they having some sort of orgy in that tent?  Kate played her part very well I thought.  The movie wasn't that great, it was predictable, with happy ending and all....but it gave me a few laughs (mostly at it's stupidity), but still, I laughed.  Why was Jack Black in this movie????Enjoy the mind numbing experience with your freinds so you can make fun of the movie together ;) enjoy.<br /><br />p.s. scrooda-lee-doo

Michael Mann can't stop sucking. No surprise there.<br /><br />We begin with minimal dialogue and exposition through words, a MM trademark. Then they did finally \\"act\\" and were howlingly bad, another MM trademark. The writing, the delivery, and the overblown \\"action\\" scenes. Give me a medal for lasting 15 minutes. Okay, 10. It felt like many more. Please, MTV, give MM a job before he films again.
B000MCH5P4|4.0|In the Biblical story that the title of this film allegorizes, the people of the world spoke one language, and were building together a tower to reach the heavens. God didn't care much for this, so to hinder their ability to work together he confounded their languages and then - because one can't be too careful about these things - he scattered them all across the earth. Is it any wonder we can't all get along? We've had the Big Guy working against us since the eleventh book of Genesis!     We've seen Babel before: one complete story formed by smaller stories, all of which touch each other in different ways. We don't, however, always see it done this well. Director Alejandro González Iñárritu (21 Grams) takes one event, the shooting of an American tourist (Cate Blanchett) in Morocco, and brings the world together. Two boys, left to guard their father's goat, and given a new hunting rifle with which to shoot jackals, do exactly what two young boys would do with a gun - they shoot it, to test both the guns and themselves. The Americans, Pitt and Blanchett, struggle with being American in a foreign country. There is the expectation of immediate medical service, but they are hours from a hospital and, they find, that their own embassy may not be on their side. A deaf Japanese girl struggles with the loss of her mother and acts out sexually in desperate pleas for affection and attention. A Mexican nanny, in charge of watching two American children, takes them across the border so that she can attend her son's wedding.    I've seen this film derided for showing a (most likely) pre-pubescent Moroccan boy who watches his sister strip, and afterwards gives himself pleasure. I'll admit that the movie could have survived the excision of that scene, but the general reaction I've noted is disbelief that such events would ever occur. Well, they would. They happen in our country, they happen everywhere. The real question is what was Iñárritu trying to show us, and did it makesense? It seemed - to this reviewer at least - that he was showing us a child forced to grow up too quickly, and the difficulties that youth has when forced to age prematurely. His illustration certainly made sense to me. It could have been shown to us through different events, but ask yourself this: are you likely to ever forget the scene of that boy squatting between the rocks? Probably not.    Also, I've seen similar derision regarding the manner in which the deaf girl, Chieko, acts out. That, perhaps, is even more surprising. All teenagers, regardless of handicap, are beset by one thing: hormones. And almost all teenagers, regardless of handicap, have no idea what to do about them. The manner in which every teenager responds is unique. When you factor in that this girl does suffer a handicap that sets her apart from other people her own age - and let's not underestimate the effects of polarizing a teenager - and that she has suffered a traumatic event, it's easy to understand how she could be confused. Could this confusion have been communicated to us differently? Sure, but it wasn't. And it passes the test: it's a believable reaction.    The film speaks to us of the domino effect, how one small, seemingly innocent gesture can cause tremors that are felt around the world, and demonstrates that such things can come full circle. While it could be said that this film makes a good argument for gun control, it is not preachy, nor is it a polemic.    A solid cast of characters put in good performances. One reviewer raved about Cate Blanchett. Don't get me wrong, she's wonderful, but this film didn't ask much of her. Rinko Kikuchi, who played the deaf Japanese girl, was believable and was nominated for an Oscar, but to me, the person who stole the show was the American children's nanny, Amelia (Adriana Barraza).     4½ stars.
B00007G1ZC|5.0|I was advised by a friend that \\"Akira Kurosawa's Dreams\\" were just a series of pretty pictures without much meaning.  I was prepared to just enjoy the cinematography but I came away with an appreciation of a kaleidescope of vision that tells of harmony with nature and one another.  I don't necessarily concur with the whole concept expressed in  the movie but I'd rather watch this than \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" any day. <br /> <br />There are eight seemingly independent vision (dreams) that subtly tie together to give the director's vision clarity and impact.  The first story tells of the dangers of disobeying the laws of nature; even those we totally depend on cannot always help us when we break this taboo.  The second tells of the danger of destroying natural things that not only benefit our lives but improve the quality of it as well.  Once destroyed, natural treasures may only be found in dreams.  The third story tells of how man is helpless against the powerful forces of nature.  The fourth episode reminds us of humanity's self-destructive nature. <br /> <br />In a break in the logical process, the fifth episode reminds us of humanity's ability to create and understand beauty and harmony.  The path shown, in other words, can be altered within our own capabilities.  The sixth episode returns to the potential self destruction of humanity and the seventh shows how that same self-destruction can not only destroy ourselves but all of nature as well.  The final episode leads us back to a beginning point where, with a new attitude, the predicted doom and gloom need not happen. <br /> <br />All scenes are exceptionally well created on film.  The color, the impressionism, the gloom, all underscore Kurosawa's message.  Indeed, if you don't care for the message, don't skip this film.  Watch it to appreciate the technical talents of Kurosawa and his cameramen, artists, set designers etc..  Whether one is an adherant to the theory of Global Warming or other theories of apocalypse, it is hard not to appreciate the beauty of one man's artistic effort to make his statement.  It is coherent and profound unlike the politcal cacaphony of all sides of these issues.
B00005ATQD|5.0|I believe that Kubrick's swansong is a great masterpiece, it is one of my favorite films and has been since I saw it first time. I felt under the film's spell from the very beginning: the camera was so much in love with Kidman's gorgeous figure, her golden hair; the music by Shostakovich - so European even though the film takes place in NYC. The film was so clever and so mesmerizing. The more I watched the more I realized that there was something vaguely familiar and strangely comical in the film. I kept thinking and it occurred to me that Kubrick paid homage and parodied Joyce's \\"Ulysses\\" in the same way Joyce himself treated Homer's celebrated poem. For me, there are so many similarities between \\"Bloomsday\\" and \\"Billnight\\", between both men's journeys and adventures on the streets of Dublin and NYC that I am curious if anyone else noticed that. There are visits to the Kingdom of Dead, sirens, Cyclops, the sorceress that turns men in pigs (the figure of speech that is :)). Both Bloom and Bill try to run from but can't forget and eventually come back to the only woman they are attracted to for eternity - Penelope - Molly Bloom- Alice Harford. Both deeply suffer from her infidelity (Bloom from the real one and Bill from imaginative but it hurts the same). Both are very insecure men who doubt their own masculinity and try to prove to them that they are the real men but they can't. Both are married to the strong women who would give them hope in the end - both \\"Ulysses\\" and \\"EWS\\" ends on the affirmative note. The last word in \\"Ulysses\\" \\"Yes\\" belongs to Molly just before she fell asleep and the last lines in EWS are:<br /><br />\\"Alice Harford: I do love you and you know there is something very important we need to do as soon as possible.<br />Dr. Bill Harford: What's that?<br />Alice Harford: F_uck.\\"<br /><br />If that's not the happiest and most satisfying ending for a movie ever then I don't know which one is. For the great ending I can forgive a movie many sins. But to tell you the truth, \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" is perfect, it has nothing to apologize for. It is the movie that would be admired many years from now. It is a perfect conclusion to the trilogy of great journeys of a man for search of himself - \\"Odyssey\\", \\"Ulysses\\", and \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\".h, \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" is perfect, it has nothing to apologize for.

0312965788|4.0|Read the first page. That's all you need to decide you want this book. The author is a veterinarian in Yorkshire, and perhaps my American readers are aware of a PBS series by the same name. He's just an amazingly gifted storyteller. This guy is a veterinarian, but his writing puts most \\"professional authors\\" to shame.
0446614459|2.0|When cooking or following a recipe, there are few constraints. When writing a formula novel, there are many constraints. In addition to the author's work, the editor and the agent have specific constraints. We must have action, we don't need character development. We must have action, we don't need insight into the cardboard characters. <br /> <br />The Gaussian curve applies to writers as well as coin tosses. This author is not at the top end of the curve.

B0000A1HQP|4.0|A group of well-to-do snobbish and obnoxious professionals have dinner parties every Wednesday to which each of them is required to bring an \\"idiot\\" as a guest. The victims have no idea that they are invited merely to be humiliated and their boorish \\"sponsors\\" compare their notes later to determine whose \\"idiot\\" was the best. Pierre Brochant( Thierry Lhermitte), the smug publisher thinks that he's got a winner in the tax accountant François Pignon (Jacques Villeret, sadly passed away in January 2005 - great French Comedian whose performance in \\"Robert and Robert\\" I enjoyed very much) who reproduces the famous landmarks with the matchsticks and would talk about them with never ending enthusiasm. Unfortunately for Pierre (but fortunately for us, the viewers) he throws his back just before the dinner and has to rely to Pignon's sincere generosity. The tables are turned and look who is an idiot after all...<br /><br />With the modest running time of 80 minutes, the \\"Dinner Game\\" is a delightful and very funny comedy. I would not expect anything else from Francis Veber, the director of Le Jouet, (1976) aka The Toy , La Ch&egrave;vre, (1981) aka Knock On Wood, Les Comp&egrave;res, (1983) ... aka ComDads, and Les Fugitifs, (1986) and the writer for Le Grand blond avec une chaussure noire, (1972) ... aka The Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe.<br /><br />4.5/5

B00028HBKC|2.0|This movie is overrated indeed. Religious fanatics would disagree with me. I mostly feel asleep on this. Some of the storylines didn't make sense. For instance, I didn't get that one part where the one lady was acting like something out of the Exorcist. What was that all about?
B00009RDGA|4.0|I recently watched for the first time Peter Bogdanovich's early gem (how could I miss it?) with the family team, Ryan and Tatum O'Neil, and fell in love with this charming and touching road movie/comedy that takes place during the Great Depression. Tatum gave, perhaps, one of the best performances by a child I've seen for which she received the Academy award as Best Supporting Actress. Her Addie is almost never cute (even though she could be when she wanted to) but her Addie is very smart, very observant, and much better \\"con artist\\" than \\"professional\\" Moses Pray. It was sad to see how talented Tatum was and how her career went nowhere after this triumph. Madeline Kahn, as Trixie Delight, the seductive lounge singer and P.J. Johnson as Imogene, 15 years old Trixie's maid are delightful.<br /><br />4.5/5

B000N6TX1I|3.0|I was somewhat hesitant about renting this movie, as I had heard that it was just another left/liberal rant against corporate/conservative types. It's not. If anything, it's more of a Christian allegory than anything else. The protagonist is named Theo (Greek for \\"god\\"), the movie opened in the USA on Christmas Day, and the story is basically a Nativity story set in a bleak, fascist future. It's a bit ponderous and heavy-handed in places, but overall \\"Children of Men\\" does a great job of making the world it is set in real and frightening. On its own merits, I'd give it four stars.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have to dock this DVD a half-point or more for its inclusion of an unnecessary, irrelevant, and highly biased \\"bonus feature\\" called \\"The Possibility of Hope,\\" which is complete rubbish. It is nearly a half hour long, and consists entirely of leftwing wackos ranting against globalism, capitalism, and industrial society in general -- all of which has little or nothing to do with the movie!<br /><br />At one point during the movie itself, when one of the Fishes starts making political comments, the others tell him to shut up, that it's all irrelevant now. Too bad the movie's producers didn't follow that advice. If they had, I'd be giving this DVD four stars, but as it stands I'm downgrading it to three.
0440234743|5.0|I would have to disagree with anyone who thought this story was below par.  From the very first page, Grisham had me hooked.  Troy Phelan is a sickly old man worth $11 billion and the father of six very ungrateful children.  Nate O'Riley is a famous litigator, sent to a lush rehab center, Walnut Hill, to recover from his various addictions, all financed (and not for the first time) by the head partner of the law firm, Josh Stafford.  Rachel Lane is the unknown, illegitimate child of Troy Phelan who, upon his death, inherits the entire fortune.  The plot that brings all of these characters together is the search for Rachel lead by Nate O'Riley in the wetlands of the Pantanal/Paraguay River and the Brazil/Bolivia border.  Grisham takes us on an amazing journey, describing this area in such detail, you can almost feel yourself floating on the johnboat.  The events that develop involve six spoiled, adult children and their insatiable need to declare their father insane by contesting his will [after he commits suicide and leaves all $11 billion to Rachel] and the quest to find the missing heir who happens to be a missionary doctor in a remote third world country.  The conclusion is a jolt. If you are into adventure and geography with a mind-boggling story of the spoiled rich, then \\"The Testament\\" is definitely a novel you will want to read.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Hard to believe that this originally released in 1979 because I am still listening to it!! But then again this is what defines a classic -it's timelessness. <br /> <br />Plenty of reviews on this site cram as many facts about the band as they can muster in a few paragraphs to impress the other sicophants. It seems everyone is a frustrated rock critic. I'm not going to bore you with my rock knowledge of the Clash except to make this statement....This is one of the real 5 star albums out there..make no mistakes. The lyrics make a statement about the times and the music complements them perfectly.  <br /> <br />A quick appraisal of the highlights.... <br /> <br />London Calling needs no introduction as the killer track of the last few decades. It's powerful lyrics and chords thump it along until it reaches  its haunting conclusion..\\"I never felt so much alike\\"..... <br /> <br />Spanish Bombs...classic song with the spanish lyrics in the chorus...pure genius.... <br /> <br />Lost in the supermarket....great storytelling type song about consumerism with Mick Jones pumping out the lyrics and supported by Strummer singing back up as only he can.... <br /> <br />Death or Glory...when my 12 year old sang along to this in the car a few weeks ago I knew that this is the music that can transcend the generations. The line that starts \\"its been tested by research\\" still gives me a laugh <br /> <br />Train in Vain...Mick singing a melancholy ballad about being let down.... <br /> <br />In short, everyone should have a copy of this album in their collections. The best part for any new fans is that there are so many great Clash songs on their other albums that you will not be disappointed and maybe like me you will be listening and still  loving it 20 years later......
B000ICLRIE|3.0|Kingdom of Heaven is a decent crusade film. It's grounded just enough in reality to keep me happy, but changes enough to keep me interested, and the changes made are somewhat understandable.<br /><br />What's annoying is that the BD version of the director's cut does not come with ANY special features. Major disappointment. Picture quality is spectacular though.
0060887966|2.0|I agree with the person who called this book psychobabble. The story rambles and pretty much goes nowhere--old bromides in an reused package. This journey was an unsuccessful vehicle to deliver the wisdom of the ages. Dorothy discovered There's no place like home! on the way to Oz in a much more compelling story. So did the friends she picked up along the way. People who like the fantasy genre would undoubtedly enjoy it more than I did. A waste of time; good thing it was so short. Two stars because it was totally clean, otherwise only one.

B000001IQH|5.0|Just a great CD packed full of great punk songs. Sure the guy has a voice like a blown motor but it only adds to the brillance of their songwriting ability as it doesn't need to sound good to be good.  <br /> <br />The album does not have any duds on it although I think Junkie Man is probably the weakest track and that in itself ain't too bad.... <br /> <br />The highlights for me are: 'Olympia WA', 'Lock step and Gone', 'Daly City Train', 'Listed MIA', 'As wicked'  and 'The Wars End'. The bass introduction to 'Journey to the End of the East Bay' is an absolute classic and one of my fav basslines along with 'Guns of Brixton' for punk genre. <br /> <br />I think the best thing about Rancid (and previously the Clash) is that they take you on a journey with their lyrics...they are honest, realistic and punchy...I never get sick of listening to this and this CD is my first pick on my i-pod when I have to fly.... <br /> <br />If you are thinking what album to buy next ..buy this..it is pure quality and a deadset classic!!!
B000005HLV|1.0|This album is laughable. I have no idea why people have rendered Mayhem a classic black metal band. The instrumentals were, while not horrible, nothing to rave about. And the vocals sounded like some stoned and drunken bum making fun of the whole black metal scene while kicking a can down an alleyway. Probably the worst vocals in the history of black metal.    Also, in regards to Vorthog's comment: I'm a fan of Dimmu Borgir and Emperor (more so Emperor than Dimmu Borgir, but thats not the point). But on the other hand I'm also a fan of Darkthrone...and Xasthur, Mutiilation, ect. Darkthrone is definitely not a key-board oriented black metal band, and neither are the others mentioned but I still think they have some great CD's. The reason I dont like Mayhem isnt because they dont have key-boards, it's simply because they suck.    Do not get this album. You'll be wasting your money.
B000001EYO|3.0|This cd definitely has some good points. A great song by Dylan from the opening credits and my favourite, \\"Dead Flowers\\" done by Townes Van Zandt. But tremendously written by Jagger and Richards. Funny how my faves are from the start and end of the film. Between these two songs and a rousing \\"Hotel California\\" by the Gypsy Kings, I'm happy enough, but oddly, no Creedance. What am I gonna listen to while reaching for that joint I dropped in my lap in the car?
0316286850|4.0|The Book provides a new dimension in makeup application and techinique.  I've had this book for over year or so, and I find myself referring back to it quite often. It's indeed a indispensible read with stunning photographs and brilliant visuals. Being a novice in makeup application, this book gave me a a whole new insight on the variety of makeup techniques that was used to achieve a certain desired effect; ranging from goth, mod, hollywood glam, all the way to the neutral pallette (for simpletons like myself). Even if one doesn't wear makeup, this book will defintely inspire you to do so.
B000MCH5P4|5.0|Babel is a complex and stunning movie. The stories move slowly, and interconnect eventually, but they each stand on their own as well. The effect of a gun, a wedding, and a suicide on three different families, and their children, makes profound statements. There is a lingering tension throughout the movie, of something horrible about to happen, of people that cannot communicate, but, in many ways, the message is, that if we are to love our children we must learn to communicate. <br />
B000N6TX1I|5.0|I've seen a lot of movies in my twenty years on this planet. If you've seen my DVD collection and my movie poster binder at the apartment, you know that this is very VERY true. Most of my childhood was spent in front of a TV watching countless films, my favorite growing up being Child's Play, To Kill a Mockingbird, and Pink Floyd's The Wall (I was a messed up kid growing up and have since gotten worse some might argue). Before this movie came out, I considered Memento, Amelie, and To Kill a Mockingbird my favorite films (it was a three way tie cause I could never settle on just one being my favorite). Now, however, I can say I have one movie that's my favorite. Here's the summary:<br /><br />With this dystopian world ravished by war, paranoia and the frustrations of Man the Orwellian vision of Nineteen Eighty-Four, the totalitarian future is now complete and amongst us. With female fertility becoming obsolete, Man cannot reproduce, and no child has been born on the face of the planet for eighteen years. Man, and his future, is dying. Soon he shall be extinct. Theo, the beaten, downtrodden and middle-aged ex-political activist will, unwittingly, become involved in a war of an underground revolt. Here he is active once more, in the perilous journey across England's Home Counties, with a young girl, Kee, who, to Theo's bewilderment is pregnant. The first pregnant woman for more than eighteen years. This secret must be protected, at all cost, and mother and child must flee to the mysterious and enigmatic Human Project, across the seas. Their flight is a constant fight for survival. Who can be trusted? Who can keep a secret?<br /><br />This film does such a good job of showing us a future that dosen't seem so far fetched. You see how the epidemic affects everyone, from the high class (Danny Huston's character Nigel) to the lowest class (the fugees, who migrate to England in hopes of a better life). As well as being a wonderful original story, the film is an excellent example of social commentary in film. So many underlining themes are present that it is unbelievable that this film was all but ignored during award season.<br /><br />Another key reason why this film is so emotionally engaging is the way it is filmed. The Stedicam technique is used so flawlessly in this film that the audience grows attached with the characters so much that when any character faces their end, one is brought to tears.<br /><br />At this time, I have watched this film four times. I plan on watching it many more times cause there is that much depth to it. If you stop at the simple plot of Theo attempting to get Kee to the human project, you'll miss so much. There is Theo's personal struggle, there is the Fishes fight for what they believe is right, there is the country itself's attempt at keeping the world going. I wish I could put everything I feel for this film in word, but being that I'm in the computer lab, it's hard to think staright. Don't worry though, I'm sure there'll be another blog eventually devoted to this film. Until then, WATCH IT!example of social commentary in film.

0007205236|3.0|As with most books shoved down my throat by any English or History teacher, Angela's Ashes was merely another book that was going to consume much of my Spring Break in an effort to put more useless information into my brain. I was immediately turned off by just the sight of the three-hundred-and-some page memoir and as I began to read, it was clear that it was going to be a very long vacation.  Don't get me wrong.  This is, for the most part, not a bad book.  It is, however, very repetative and instead of feeling sorry for Frank McCourt and his family, I found myself merely reading it to finish it.  After about the first five chapters, you find yourself reading the same story over and over again.  The plot can be summarized easily in several sentences.  It is about a poor family who lives in Ireland at the time of the Second World War.  The father is a drunk and cannot find a job and whenever he has a job, he drinks his wages, gets fired and leaves the family hungry over and over again.  The plot does have a twist in it, though.  The father goes to work in England and drinks all of his wages leaving his family hungry back in Ireland.  However, aside from the blatent monotony of this book, I found that it actually held my interest merly for some of the experiences that McCourt went through in his childhood.  I found his school years mildly interesting but that also slowly became repetative as he progressed through his elementary years.  Another part I found interesting was when he contracted typhoid fever and all of his experiences in the hospital.  I won't say anymore, however.  If for some reason you want to read this book of your own volition, I don't want to spoil it for you.  Needless to say, many people have enjoyed this book and praise it for McCourtys artistic writing style and for its accurate interpratation of life in the lanes of Limeric.  Needless to say, I did not find it as captivating as some, probably because it was forced upon me as an assignment.  Had I read it on my own time, which I highly doubt I would have, I may have found it a bit more likable.  If you are planning on reading this book, be very sure that it is your kind of literature because if it isn't you might just fall asleep in the middle.
B0000WN0ZK|5.0|yes, this is a slow moving movie... and god forbid, you might need to think. This is a film, not a movie. People who like art house will enjoy this, if you prefer to be spoon fed, go rent one of the mainstream films.
0307276902|4.0|I'm surprised that anyone could read this book and not realize it's FICTION.  That should have been evident from all the stereotypical Hollywood characters: the troubled, but beautiful girl (who forms the protagonist's romantic interest), the emotionally-vulnerable and big-hearted gangster, the friendly Federal Judge, a groping Catholic Priest from the past, the emotionally-distant, but well-intentioned middle-class parents, and the cooly-inflexible Nurse Ratchet medical providers -- all written from the wailing perspective of a spoiled middle class junkie and alcoholic!  As somone who has participated in a Family Program at a Drug Rehabilitation center, I think this book captures some of the flavor of the experiences of an addict and his/her family and loved ones.  It may not always be this bloody, but it ain't pretty.  Addiction is a widespread problem in our society with far-reaching consequences.  Forget whether this book is true or exagerated or complete fiction; read it if you want to capture a flavor of the madness of substance abuse -- and some of the experiencee and aftermath of commercial rehabilitation centers.
1582701709|4.0|Even if you're a sceptic of unexplained coincidences or mind power, this book is a good read.  It will, if anything else, open your mind to new possibilities and give most people hope where it never existed before.  <br />More in the lines of a story, you MUST read the book \\"Her Name Will Be Miracle\\".  It follows alot of the practices mentioned in this book \\"The Secret\\".

B000MQC9H4|4.0|What happens when two love scorned women, one in Los Angeles and the other in England, switch houses in an attempt to spend some time alone and away from men? Why they fall in love with the first man they meet upon arrival. What else would you expect? Yes, the plot is predictable and the premise overdone. And yes, this is most definitely a chick flick. But take heart you testosterone laden Neanderthals in the audience, Jack Black is one of the male love interests so you're safe to watch.<br /><br />`The Holiday' released in `06 is a light, good-hearted, romantic comedy boasting four popular stars involved in two separate romances on two continents, Cameron Diaz and Jude Law in England and Kate Winslet and Jack Black in Los Angeles. Both storylines are engaging and the chemistry is believable. My only complaint about the film is that more time was spent developing the romance in England and less on the Winslet/Black relationship in L.A. which happened to be my favorite part of the movie. Oh well, still a lot of fun and a great date film. The Los Angeles romance also includes a wonderful subplot with Eli Wallach which is a great addition to the storyline.
0743289684|5.0|Ayaan Hirsi Ali's memoir of growing up female of Somalian parents is an indictment of the treatment of women that prevails in many Islamic countries, as well as among Muslims living in Europe. Her story is a harrowing account of domestic abuse, arranged marriage, and living as a refugee, set against decades of tyranny and tribal warfare in post-colonial Somalia. Claiming asylum in Holland, she becomes an outspoken advocate of women's rights and, in a storm of publicity, runs for and is elected to a seat in Parliament. Along the way, her outspoken opposition to Islamic views of women has triggered death threats and the murder of a Dutch filmmaker, Theo van Gogh, who made a film about her.<br /><br />While her story is an inspiring example of someone with enormous faith in herself and the determination to defy all obstacles to achieve her goals, it is also a story of self-education, as she learns through her experience and her reading to challenge and reformulate the beliefs she has held since childhood about the world, about herself, and about God. Her book is also a disturbing call to action to confront what she regards as the West's failure to fully comprehend the chief aim of Islam - world domination through complete submission to the God whose word is revealed in the Qur'an.<br /><br />Her story dwells at length on her childhood, lived in Somalia, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, and Kenya - her absent father, an educated man who has given his life to the political struggle to restore democracy to his homeland, her mother, increasingly embittered by life's misfortunes, her domineering grandmother, and her sister and brother. There are the countless members of her tribe, her friends and teachers in school, her father's other wives and children, and the young men who figure romantically in her life. With her eye and her memory for detail, her story becomes an immersion in a variety of widely different African cultures. That same gift for observation illuminates her experience of European culture when she arrives in Holland. For Western readers, her book opens a window onto an unsettling view of Islam mostly hidden from the media, while exploring the impact of Islamic culture introduced to Europe following years of immigration. Readers may also be interested in the novels of Somalian writer, Nuruddin Farah, whose works have covered many of these same themes.erience of European culture when she arrives in Holland.

0440418569|5.0|[warning - major spoilers] I loved this fantasy series, for the characters and generosity of spirit.  Some reviews on this site think the ending is a a let down but I was pleased to not have a cheesey Hollywood-style epic showdown in the final scene.  The biggest lessons for Lyra were those of the heart, and of work and knowledge, after all. And why do people complain that all the loose ends were not fully tied up?  Do you really want an epiogue saying how Will & Mary managed once they returned?  How Lyra's life turned out?  If anything happened to Mrs Coulter and Lord Asriel after they fell into the abyss?  Not all the threads in life lead somewhere neat and tidy so this book should not be jizsaw puzzle where everything is absolutely resolved.  I worry about how Will in particular will manage after we leave him and that gives added resonance for me to the book.  And the reviewer who said Mary did not 'act the serpent' is plain wrong!  She tells them stories which open their minds and hearts towards a sexual relationship.  Mary did start to help the Malfula with the spyglass, explaining that they needed to find someway of directing the pods towards the dust.  Perhaps they would have gone on to do so if Will & Lyra had not sorted things? Yes the book is anti-religion but is it necessarily anti-God?  The emphasis on goodness, kindness, building knowledge and universal consciousness, the interconnectedness of everything, the release after death into the universal ... There is a lot here for children, indeed readers of all ages, to consider.
B000N6U0E2|3.0|The recent '06 release of the DVD `The Pursuit of Happyness\\" provides the vehicle of yet another great performance by Will Smith, the next Denzel Washington. However the perfect vechicle for a one man tour-de-force does not always translate into the perfect movie.<br /><br />Not that this isn't a good film, it just isn't as good as Will Smith. Yes, the film is based on a true, inspirational story and Will's real life son Jaden, playing his on screen son is adorable. There are also numerous enjoyable performances by the supporting cast, specially the homeless guy (John Robb) looking for a time machine. Product values are superior throughout and the storyline possesses both depth and character. The problem is that Chris Gardner's (Will Smith) personal crisis goes on too long and by the time things are finally turning positive the film abruptly ends and the audience is denied the opportunity to sit back for a moment and relish the emotional high from his accomplishment.<br /><br />A good film, definitely something you should see. Repeatability factor? Once is enough for me. My rating 3 ½ Stars.
6303407161|4.0|This is a great film--the acting, writing, and directing are superb. Especially noteworthy was John Turturo--his performance was great! The others were also excellent. The story was believable and it developed at a nice pace. My only regret was that at times it slowed down considerably and unnecessarily, making the movie longer than necessary, especially in all the trivia scenes which were meant to increase audience believability in the characters. And yes, the characters were real, many dimensional, and this was nicely portrayed throughout. I highly reccommend this film, well worth seeing many times.
B000MZHW40|3.0|I mean if THIS film gets 5 stars, what on earth do you give something like a Raging Bull or a Deer Hunter or Schindler's List??  OK, DiCaprio was VERY good in this...he is establishing himself with The Aviator, Gangs of New York, The Departed, etc. that he can play a # of different roles and pull them all off very effectively....Is this REALLY the kid who started out on Growing Pains???  Amazingly, it is...Unfortuneately the rest of the film bites off WAY more than it can chew...the first half of the film is well paced and delves into many issues---Diamond trade, black on black slavery, white mercenaries, etc. with sufficient depth...the second half however is a mess....I mean what was the visit to the jungle sactuary/school for 5 minutes of film time intended to convey??  Edit that out!!!  You get the feeling that there are like 6 more hours of film on the floor somewhere that they had done but cut out to try and get it down to 2 1/2 hours...and did we need the cliche \\"saving the day by sacrificing ourself and dying alone and calling our true love by cell phone\\" scene??  In the end the film TRYS to be an action film, it TRYS to be a romance, it TRYS to show the horrors of African Civil War, it TRYS to show the links between Western materialism/Capitalism and the ravaging of 3rd world countries, but it comes out as a mixed bag of all and none of these at the same time....In the hands of a more skilled team the film may have focused exclusively on DiCaprio's and Hounsou's characters as they are the most compelling but we are not that lucky...Entertaining? Mildly...but one of the best films of the year??  Hardly...

1582701709|4.0|Count me among the throngs of people who have discovered 2 remarkable and spiritually fulfilling books: The Secret and Nexus: A Neo NovelIn fact, if you click on this Nexus: A Neo Novel link, you'll find amazon.com has paired this book with the also excellent Law of Attraction while amazon.ca has paired it with The Secret. It's an opportunity to buy 2 great books, as I did, at a low package rate.  <br /> <br />The Secret is all about focusing on positive outcomes to achieve desired results. It is also a spiritual book that emphasizes the overcoming of problems and fostering of goodness when channeling positive energy. It is not a panacea or cure-all, in my view. Rather, it offers very welcome and helpful approaches to assisting - not guaranteeing - the achievement of greater fulfillment in life.  <br /> <br />In contrast, Nexus: A Neo Novel is a novel, but a novel that happens to contain a great many highly effective spiritual teachings and selections from Deborah Morrison's earlier work, Mystical Poetry, that you can meditate to. Nexus also emphasizes the achievement of positive outcomes by reaching your inner core, or nexus. To read this book is to take a personal journey of self-discovery. Both books offer very sound advice and effective approaches and both are highly recommended. Nexus: A Neo Novel
B000BKJ78U|5.0|With all of the film captured on these discs, you can sit there for about 6 hours watching the Rebellion crush the Empire in strategic, intense, and fun scenes. Now, on to each episode. Before I start, I want to say these are originally episodes 1, 2, 3 but were made before the real episodes 1, 2, 3 but since these were written to be later on in the saga, Lucasfilm, the company in charge of Star Wars turned these three movies into episodes 4, 5, and 6. <br /> <br />Star Wars Episode IV (4) A New Hope: Luke Skywalker is just recognized in this movie, in which him, Han Solo, Ben Kenobi, Princess Leia, and Chewbacca fly in on the Millenium Falcon onto the Empire's project the Death Star, this large space station can destroy a single planet, as it did to Princess Leia's home planet Alderaan. <br /> <br />As Ben Kenobi gets struck down by Darth Vader, Luke sees and gets depressed, because Ben Kenobi was a mentor to him. <br /> <br />Review on Episode 4: Great! I am really impressed by all of the film captured on this disc, for me being 25, I wasn't around for the actual airing in the movie theatres, I liked this episode, because it got modified and is better than the original. <br /> <br />Star Wars Episode V (5) The Empire Strikes Back: Now, we look at the 2nd installment of the Original Star Wars Trilogy, and see that Luke is more wise, he is training to be a Jedi, just like his father before him. Luke heads to Dagobah to where he meets a Jedi Master, Yoda the Whill, Yoda for short. He then finds out that Yoda knew his father. But, as Luke travels farther in the Star Wars galaxy he heads for Bespin, to where Darth Vader waits for him. As both Vader and Luke engage in a powerful, epic, battle. As Darth Vader tells Luke a tragic line (Well, I will leave that for you to find out) Luke purposely falls down a large tunnel.  Han Solo then gets frozen in carbonite and sent to Jabba the Hutt a large, slimy, low-class, no manners, no good creature on Tatooine. <br /> <br />StarWars Episode 5 The Empire Strikes Back Review: Wow! This one was highly enjoyed, because of the epic action that deeply covered the larger parts of this movie! <br /> <br />Star Wars Episode VI (6) The Return of the Jedi:  Luke Skywalker has become an official Jedi Knight, and has returned to his home planet Tatooine, to save his frozen in carbonite friend from Jabba the Hutt's terrible palace. Luke succeeds, but also has to fight Darth Vader. Luke also finds out that Princess Leia is his sister and hears that Darth Vader will turn Leia to the dark side if Luke doesn't so Luke prevails and fills himself with even more preserverence and cuts Vader's hand off. <br /> <br />Star Wars Episode 6 Return of the Jedi Review: This movie was well written and I highly enjoyed the action filling the scenes of the movie! <br /> <br />Thank you, I highly suggest buying the Star Wars Original Trilogy Boxed Set.
B0007OY2P8|1.0|When I was considering buying this film, I read all the reviews and though alot of them were negative, I decided to get it anyway because I am a huge fan of Jane Austen's books and like BBC's movies. I was very disapointed after watching it! This was one of the worst movies I have seen. I could not believe it! The music was much to modern for time period, and they made the movie much too creepy, whereas the book is much more lighthearted, though there are some dark parts to it. If you're considering buying this, I would advise against it. I hate to be negative, but watching this movie was a waste of time.
B00005JK8K|5.0|Personally I view Windtalkers as one of the most realistic war movie, from the \\"horror of war\\" point of view.

Looking forward to your next War Movie.
044661758X|4.0|Michael Connelly is arguably the best, most consistent writer of police procedural crime novels - perhaps ever.  His previous life as a crime beat reporter has given him insight into the LAPD and as a result Connelly's novels have an authentic feel to them that is rare in the genre.<br /><br />The plot:  Harry Bosch is on trial in a civil case brought by the spouse of an alleged serial killer (the so-called Doll Maker) that Harry shot and killed a number of years earlier.  As the trial gets underway a new murder victim is discovered and is tied to the Doll Maker - the catch - the new victim was murdered after everyone thought the Doll Maker was dead.  Did Harry shoot the wrong man?  Is there a copy cat killer?  Did the Doll Maker have a partner?  The new Doll Maker killings raise serious questions about Harry's use of deadly force as the wrongful death suit brought against the City moves forward, making it even more important that Detective Bosch solve this mystery quickly.<br /><br />Connelly is a great story teller and The Concrete Blonde is one of his best.  Whether Connelly's story is set in the courtroom or in the glass tower, Connelly gives us dialogue and characters that are both realistic and compelling.  Connelly adds depth to Bosch's character in each new novel but without detracting from the plot or becoming overwrought and sentimental.  The City of LA is a character in and of itself, and Connelly has a great feel for the City in the post Rodney King era.<br /><br />The Concrete Blonde is a must-read for crime fiction fans.

0007205236|4.0|When I first began reading Angela's Ashes, my only concern was getting a good grade in history. As I kept reading, however, it turned into a book I couldn't put down. I would commit to reading a chapter, but I'd end up reading four. The scenes and events in the book were tragic to read, but there was a strange untruthful feeling about them. The events were so unlike my life that they were almost unbelievable. I've never experienced not having food to eat, or clean clothes to wear so those events are a little hard to believe fully-- even when I know there are plenty of people who deal with that daily. I think the sense of untruthfulness was what made the book sad, but not too sad to read.  <br />     Reading Angela's Ashes gave me a sense of a lifestyle unlike mine, and to me that was the best part of the book. When I was reading, I could visualize the streets of Limerick, the church doors being slammed, even the taste and smell of the fish and chips. I felt like I was in Limerick walking with Frank McCourt throughout his life. It was incredible that the description in the book was so well written that it allowed me to visualize everything and make me feel like I was right there experiencing it.  <br />     I would recommend the book for anyone who wants a good read that is hard to put down, or for anyone who wants a different or new perspective on life. Reading Angela's Ashes gave me a new appreciation for all the things I have in my life. Frank McCourt is a great author for writing this book and for being so honest about his tragic past.  <br /> <br /> <br />--Madison Ries <br />Sandia Prep <br />Albuquerque, NM <br />

Do I really need a book that tells me that self-discipline is required to control the spend-spend-spend mentality 'cause I want it even though I don't need it? NO! <br /> <br />Nothing new here, folks, that common sense and a wee bit of intelligence won't tell you. Also quite obvious is the fact that the discipline required to work for your goals comes within and not from the pages of a book. There are no magic formulas and no quick fixes. If there were, we would all be rich by now. <br /> <br />For those looking for one, this is not a 'how-to' book. It is not a book on economics, accounting, investing, etc. This is a book about a mind-set, and what that mind-set may get you. A mind-set that I believe to be obvious. <br /> <br />I don't consider this to be a bad book - just a book with no \\"AHA's\\" between the covers. This book may be beneficial to high school students. Adults need to look elsewhere for their reading materials. <br /> <br />Barely average. . . . <br />

And if the story bores you, well. . . .the illustrations/photos are beautiful!<br /><br />Granted, this is far from a masterpiece. But sometimes at the end of the day, I am looking for a form of entertainment that does not require too much brain power! So, enjoy the chase.<br /><br />And, oh yes!

I would have liked more closure on more characters, I guess is all.<br /><br />Ending aside, this book is amazing. I found that I had to force myself to slow down in order to savor it - she is such a gifted writer and I only get to read her once a year (now that I've caught up on all her books). Every time I recommend that a friend of mine read a Jodi book, I always tell them the same thing, \\"She's amazing, her books read like a movie!\\" I often find myself thinking while I'm reading - \\"Wow, I can totally see this scene!\\"<br /><br />All in all, not my absolute favorite of her books, but it's up there. I didn't cry like I did for Songs of the Humpback Whale or My Sister's Keeper.<br /><br />I must say though, Thank you Jodi for ending Peter the way you did...
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Let me start off by saying that it is worth it to buy an earlier album of Avenged Sevenfold, listening to it and then buying this most recent album. Unbelieveable! Syn Gates(lead guitar) and The Rev(drums) have no current competition. I've seen these guys in concert and they are the real thing. M. Shadows(lead singer) is a little above mediocre in his presentation, but I assure you, the singing is not why you buy this album. If you are a heavy metal lover like me, you MUST put this album in your collection. Absolutely insane riffs and approaching 1/64th note bass kicking will follow.
B000NDIAWO|4.0|Beyonce's album B'Day is really a good album. On April 11, 2007 I asked my Mom to pick up Beyonce's B'Day album for me and I'm glad that I asked her to do so. At first I didn't think I was going to like the album because I didn't like the song Deja Vu at first. Then when the singles Ring The Alarm, Irreplaceable and Beautiful Liar was released that's when I started thinking I should by this album. This album talks about the good and the bad of relatonships. If you're going through rough times in a relationships or your in a good place in your relationship you can listen to this album. I recommend this album!!
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|Okay, putting aside the gross inaccuracies in historical detail, my main problem with this movie is the complete lack of satire and wit that Austen is famous for. Hollywood made this a chick flick for the masses rather than a deep and hilarious jab at the ridiculous happenings in a society bound by precise codes of conduct. In addition, Austen, in Pride and Prejudice, was making gentle fun of the unbelievable amount of time people spent on making matches, thinking of marriage, and what people look for in a marriage partner. All of that is lost in this silly version.  <br /> <br />I don't think any of the cast is true to form--no one captures their character and so we are left with yet another flat romance that is meant to coo at you rather than shake you up with its pointed statement. In many respects, I think Hollywood believes audiences are  mindless and unable to tell the difference between a good adaptation of a classic and a travesty.  <br />If I had to make an analogy of pride and Prejudice I would say this <br /> <br />Jane Austen's original novel = Lobster with butter <br />BBC version = A prime cut steak, perfectly grilled and seasoned <br />This trite production = Spam in a can
1594481717|5.0|This is in my estimation an important book. I read it shortly after reading Friedman's The World is Flat. I highly recommend reading them closely together as they compliment each other nicely. Pinks three questions that everyone should ask themselves still resonate with me months after reading this work. 1. Can someone overseas do it cheaper? 2. can a computer do it faster? 3. Is what I'm offering in demand in an age of abundance? I regularly consider these questions now in my assessment in decision making processes. Look out if you answer yes, yes, no!<br /><br />The image of high concept high touch is similarly meaningful in how I look at the world and my industry.<br /><br />Finally the resources available at the end of each chapter are extremely useful for nurturing \\"a whole new mind\\". This work is both visionary and practical in its usefulness. These two seemingly disparate compliments are only possible because of the way Mr. Pink has crafted this text.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|I saw this twice in the theater, and I must say, I have never felt quite as moved watching a film as with this one.  It is not THE example of technical brilliance that many are claiming...but good night, it is very, very close.  So, for those watching this on DVD, make sure you've got Dolby 5.1 and a nice viewing area, or else many of the elements that make this movie so incredibly powerful will be lost on you.  There is a world in this movie that is so completely realized, and it does not dumb it down for you.  Argue about the subtext all you want, but frankly, I did not care as I was watching the movie.  Once you get to the car ride, the movie takes off.  It is one of the top ten sequences I've seen on film.  Truly brilliant stuff, and the end scene is not far behind.   <br /> <br />Just have a big TV and a good sound system.
B000006E4C|5.0|<br />This is no ordinary piece of music. It is hypnotic and beautiful, as most other reviewers point out. It can put all other music out of your mind for periods of time; you only want to stay in the trance. <br /> <br />There are light and dark energies at play in this music. The elements of light are held in the beautiful syntax of rhythm and melody. You might find yourself singing or whistling along very intensely, and even creating new layers to the music with your voice. The elements of darkness are represented as a sense of neurotic insanity, or obsessive particularity.  <br /> <br />To be hyptotized for its own sake is dangerous. What is behind this hypnosis? What energy is being expressed here? As you move into your third and fourth listen, ask yourself whether you feel expansion or contraction. <br /> <br />For those who are interested in trance states and deep inward gazing, this recording is definitely an experience worth having. If nothing else, it can remind us that music is awesomely powerful.
B000001ESF|5.0|[...]   Just sample some of Europe s still working prog bands and artists up to now .  Now , onto 2112 .  Rush , a band i have not had the time or privilige of reading much on , has been of my liking since my adolescence .  Now , about 16 years after changing ' musical ' paths i have come to value this great album again .     When i first heard this it floored me , as it did when I acquired it again not long ago .  It has great melodies , and does not bore for one instance .  It is amazing that it has that capabilty after ( now ) 31 years .     The prog - or music - world in 76 was going through intriguing stages .  Floyd had just delivered WYWH .  Genesis had begun working with Bil Brufford , and Gabriel was not singing anymore .  Frampton had just released comes alive .  It was an intriguing - indeed - time .  I was one year old ( in 76 = ) )  Ok ..     So , after letting you know relevant info on that year , in musical history let s just say Peart, Lee and Liefson made a Bona fide record .  There are albums that can be heard throughout without the need of skipping songs .  But this is one that really leaves the listener content .       On a techincal note , I d love ot know what kind of sound system Rush used in the late 70 s to promote their albums , and please their fans ( live ) .  Live rigs are always important .  Being an avid Grateful Dead fan , there is a wonderful book called GD gear that tells of all the gear the group used in its 30 year history .  If anyone knows any of this ( of Rush ) , feel free to comment on this data .     My other album of this group i recommend is hemispheres .  Well done album .  Rush s musical catalog for my liking should begin with any of these two albums .  Although there are the earlier ones that delight ( Fly by night ) .     The 2112 suite ( especially the overture , discovery and the dream ) and the song Tears , have to be among the best songs made in 20th century music history .  Like a good bottle of wine , this albumhas aged to an intoxicatingly ( good ) level .  Enjoy .  God bless Liefson , Peart and Lee for this ..
B000OCY7JE|4.0|Early on in Susanne Bier's Oscar Nominated (Best Foreign Film 2006) film \\"After The Wedding\\", Danish expat-in-India Jacob (the solid Mads Mikkelsen) is faced with the prospect of reluctantly returning to his homeland after twenty years to meet with a mysterious man who is offering the necessary funding to keep his school/orphanage open.  When explaining to Pramod (his adopted son-of-sorts) that he must leave, the precocious eight year old asks about the wealth of people in Denmark and finally concludes, \\"If I was rich, I'd be happy.\\"<br /><br />Soon after, when we delve deeply into the lives of the proposed benefactor and his family, we see that this proclamation certainly does not apply to all people.  Or, at the very least, it definitely does not apply to billionaire Jorgen (the authoritative Rolf Lassgard) or his family.<br /><br />Although it seems like it might at first.  The jump from the teeming Indian squalor to the lush green Danish countryside almost jarringly illustrates the contrast of cultures (and that contrast is definitely underscored by patriarch Jorgen blasting \\"It's Raining Men\\" in his SUV); the disparity between the Third World and the First World is indeed extreme (the difference is Two Worlds, by the way - I did the math).  It's quite comical to see Jacob, upon arrival, trying to adjust to the cushy confines of the hotel where Jorgen houses him, as he can't figure out how to work the electronic amenities.<br /><br />When Jacob finally meets with Jorgen, his pitch is given short shrift by the busy billionaire: \\"We're through,\\" Jorgen says impatiently, leaving Jacob's presentation video mostly unseen.  But he still leaves the donational door a bit ajar as he invites him to his daughter's wedding, where Jacob could get some more face time.  This seems like a good plan at first, as Jacob has nothing else to do while in town, but revelations at the ensuing reception reveal that all is not as it seems.  Indeed, when newly-betrothed bride Anna (played by perky Stine Fischer Christensen) rises to make an unconventional speech and says, \\"Mom's waiting for something to go horribly wrong,\\" well it turns out that Mom (aka Helene) (Sidse Babett Knudsen, in a deeply-layered performance) doesn't have to wait long, and all of their lives are soon turned upside-down.<br /><br />As an unabashed fan of Scandinavian cinema, I had high expectations for this film, and it didn't disappoint in most respects.  The crisp, naturalistic cinematography and unapologetic (although occasionally a bit melodramatic) exploration of emotions is all to be expected.  Also always welcome are the sardonic, dry lines of humor and the quirky characters (such as online gambler Grandma, who - according to Helene - is senile \\"only when she wants to be\\" and is mostly seen complaining about her laptop's wireless internet reception).<br /><br />A couple of aspects of this film didn't quite work for me, however.  First, I found the multitude (maybe between 20-30 close-ups) of shots of single eyes was a bit overdone and took me out of the narrative flow, without having enough of a symbolic upside.  Also, some of the scenes teetered just at the edge of being a bit too maudlin and soap-operatic, but I guess life sometimes does get that way, and the actors are never unconvincing.<br /><br />Finally, some of the tonal shifts were a bit too uneven in places, as the film careens from joy to sorrow in split-seconds that can be unnerving in such an otherwise slowly-paced film.  But about that pacing: others may complain that this film could have been a bit cut to a more streamlined length, but I personally love the lingering and the loitering that takes place in movies like this - I feel we get to know as much about the characters during their \\"down time\\" as we would when there's \\"something happening.\\"<br /><br />Ultimately, I feel this film ends up being an evocative exploration of whether or not to to tell the truth, of when to tell the truth, and of how to tell the truth even when it's difficult. And telling the truth when it's difficult is something this movie is very good at doing.  Four stars.<br /><br />(p.s. I'm purposely not telling you who says this review's title quote because I don't want to spoil it for you.)d of how to tell the truth even when it's difficult.

B000MXPE7O|2.0|The story occurs in a series of flash-forwards and flash-backs moving play by play like a chess game over many years.  If you miss a caption, you're struggling to figure out just where and when you are.  The film's an interesting bit of history, but hardly worth the thriller designation.  For the most part, it just ground on.
B000000Y59|5.0|This is my seventh Evans recording and it is like I am getting to know him all over again.  This album has energy, freshness and joy that just isn't there on later recordings.  The recording quality is more than satisfactory.  The group's playing is smart and engaging with a skillful balance between technical skill and understated musicality.  The playfulness brought to standards like Witchcraft is a welcome contrast to many of his later more brooding works.  LaFaro and Motian provide their legendary support and interplay with their typcial flair.  This was definitely a high point for Evans, before drugs, bad health and personal problems got in the way.  No Evans collection would be complete without this recording.

B00066N8JS|3.0|Seems like a good time to re-evaluate NIN's 1994 breakthrough The Downward Spiral. It's been reissued with digital remastering and a bonus disc of remixes, and Trent Reznor has a new and very different album coming out. And with time, it's become easier to separate the musical accomplishments of The Downward Spiral from the dark, emotional subject matter and the cultural impact it had in its time.    On the plus side, the music on The Downward Spiral is more varied than anyone ever gave Reznor credit for. Everybody copied the loud angry parts (Rammstein stole the riff for \\"Du Hast\\" right from the end of \\"Eraser\\"), but Reznor could also occasionally pause and reflect, as in the ambient instrumental \\"A Warm Place,\\" and he also put all kinds of sudden changes and about-faces even into the heavy songs. The loud/soft dynamic gets abused a lot in this album, starting with the opening track, where the loud guitars abruptly give way to an extremely quiet interlude after the second chorus. But occasionally there's a bit more subtlety than that. In \\"The Becoming\\" for instance, an angry chorus suddenly turns into a rhythm on an acoustic guitar with multi-tracked chanting in the background, and then Reznor's voice comes back in and quickly gets distorted even more than before.     Occasionally, Reznor dipped into other electronic styles. \\"Piggy\\" could pass for a song by Tricky, with a vaguely jazzy rhythm produced to sound claustrophobic and dangerous. \\"Closer\\" is built on a tight house beat, and \\"Heresy\\" is KMFDM-style techno, with sound effects similar to those in \\"Lust\\" and guitars like in \\"Juke Joint Jezebel,\\" and a screaming chorus not unlike what Sascha K always does. \\"The Downward Spiral\\" is a queasily off-key near-instrumental with all kind of spooky noises mixed into the ambience, much like what Aphex Twin did on occasion. The production doesn't sound dated at all. Musically, this album is a great improvement over Pretty Hate Machine.    Nonetheless, all these examplesare exceptions to the rule, and do not really represent the vast majority of the album, which is more than one hour long. In the second half, the music begins to sound flat. The beats are loud and aggressive, and yet somewhat awkward. Except for \\"Heresy\\" and \\"Closer,\\" these songs don't have the sense of propulsive energy and motion that one finds in really good electronic music (even in industrial music, like KMFDM's \\"Naive\\"). After \\"Closer,\\" a lot of The Downward Spiral consists of grinding, hook-less sludge. Even Reznor's vocals, which are arranged into catchy rhythms in the first half, become more formless in the second half. The rhythms slacken, and it often feels like he's just screaming irregularly over a loud but senseless pile of noise. Maybe each individual song isn't bad, but it's a bit tiresome to listen to the whole album from beginning to end.    The other big drawback of the album is that, even though the music can be detailed and sophisticated, Reznor's vocal delivery has no subtlety whatsoever. He has only two settings -- almost inaudible whispering, and unhinged screaming -- and he goes back and forth between them over and over with very little variation. This really takes a lot out of the shifts in the music, and it often prevents the lyrics from making any impression whatsoever. The worst offender is probably \\"I Do Not Want This.\\" First Trent screams, \\"Don't you tell me how I feel!\\" The louder he screams this line, the more it sounds like a seventh-grader's temper tantrum. Furthermore, the \\"I want to know everything / I want to be everywhere\\" bit at the end of that same song could only have an emotional impact if it were made to sound desperate and longing. But Reznor just screams these lines, making them sound petulant and boring.     Similarly, the chorus in \\"Heresy\\" might have been impressive if he had delivered it with a confident, En-Esch-like swagger (like in \\"Die Now, Live Later\\"), but instead he screams it yet again. Upon hearing it, onecan't help but notice what an easy target Reznor chose. Even in 1994, there was nothing controversial about \\"Heresy.\\" It was certain to offend the usual people and invite some finger-wagging from the usual talking heads, but Reznor was never in any danger of becoming a pariah or losing his record contract over this song. On the contrary, there's even something safe about the way this album depicts only personal emotions, which may be directed at some abstract entity but never at any specific event. In that sense, his latest album Year Zero takes more risks.     Reznor does a better job on \\"Hurt,\\" but even at his most vulnerable he's lacking in dramatic restraint. Johnny Cash got more out of this song by emoting less. And Reznor himself became a much better singer later on. On Year Zero, his vocal performances are far superior to what he displays on The Downward Spiral. These days he sounds much more confident, relies much less on screaming, and writes about something other than his own emotions. In some sense, The Downward Spiral finds him at his weakest. His angry snarling was effective on Pretty Hate Machine, because he was singing from the point of view of a disillusioned, but fairly ordinary young man who has to go to work every day and wants to make out with pretty girls. But on this album, he's attempting to recast himself as a suffering poet and artist rather than as an ordinary man, and it's really not all that convincing. Even though this kind of narcissism appeals to angry teenagers.    So, there you have it. This was a creative and even unconventional album when it came out. However, it has severe limitations, mostly thematic rather than musical. Reznor himself doesn't make music like this anymore, and it's probably for the better.
0743496728|4.0|I returned this book to the library 3 days after checking it out anxious that the next reader reserving this book will get a head start even as I had until April 24 to read it.  Unfortunately, one day after returning this book I found out about the horrific tragedy and massacre of 32 students at the Virginia Tech.  In light of Picoult's excellent and now timely depiction of a troubled student's psyche, I feel this book should be required reading at the college level as well as the high school level.  I thought I'd seen it all until today.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|This is far and away the best blues documentary ever made, and I have seen many.  I loved Cootie Stark, and would like to have known him.  A true genius.  All of the artists reached me in a very deep way, and it was clear that the project was from the hearts of those who created it.   The blues makes usfeel good about feeling bad.  When we listen to these old blues hands, it is like somebody else knows and understands what we are feeling. And they help us feel it.  In my opinion, Ten Days Out should be at the Library of Congress, and on record at the Smithsonian Museum of American History. If Kenny Wayne Shepherd never does another thing, he can still say he made an impact.

B000KJU182|4.0|Peter Ustinov directed this unambitious work and made a great film. Beautifully shot in black & white, the story is based on a play after Melville's famous story. Billy Budd has to leave the merchant ship \\"The Rights of Man\\" to embark on the British man-of-war \\"Avenger\\". He is all innocent and cheerful, he represents goodness itself. His good nature will charm all on board, but will he charm evil in person: the master-of-arms played perfectly by Robert Ryan? There's a philosophical undertone during all the film, a debate between good and evil, and between choosing to do what the law says and what one feels to be the right thing (that is, justice). At times this slows down the pace of the film as it becomes too obvious, to the detriment of the plot itself, which becomes too static.<br /><br />I am glad this film was shot in black and white, as it suits the theme perfectly: evil vs goodness; man's laws vs the natural law of God. There are a few moments that are really intense and beautiful. For instance when Billy Bud (Terence Stamp) tries to have a conversation with evil Robert Ryan, the master-at-arms. Robert Ryan is astounded at this young man's simplicity and inability to hate: \\"-Is it ignorance or irony that makes you speak so simply? -Must be ignorance, sir. 'Cause I don't understand the other word.\\"<br /><br />It's not the kind of film you would expect seeing the colorful poster: it has hardly any action. But it's a very good film. A little gem I hadn't seen until now. I bought it as part of the \\"Literary Classic Collection\\" package, and I didn't expect it to be such a good film. Worth buying the whole package.
B000KJU1HI|5.0|If you are a Dylan fan and don't own this, then run out and buy or order now. This is not to be missed.  Don't Look Back, shot by D.A. Pennebaker (who almost missed the chance to shoot the document, actually, when is partner, Leah was approached by Albert Grossman, Dylan's manager) to see if they would be intresed in touring with Dylan to shoot the documentary. Leah said, \\"Who's Bob Dylan\\"  When Pennebaker returned he was flabberasted, but thank god for all, the stubborn Grossman returned and the contract or deal was hashed out over a hotel napkin (true story).<br /><br />With a small budget, Don't Look Back is a lean, mean production of what the tour was really about, but it's not all sex, drugs, rock 'n roll. Hardly. In fact, it shows Dylan coming to terms with his own fame and how he negotiates this and how he negotiates his way through reporters, various interviewers (one famous scene with a 'science student' who Dylan toyed with in a game of cat and mouse, and who he asked, \\"Why should i want to know you? What could you ever do for me?\\" AT the time, maybe Dylan was right. As it would turn out, our young 'science student' went on to form Chrysalis Records, so that was a bit of a mistake - Dylan lacked some prescience here.<br /><br />Here we see Dylan as a thoughtful, philosophical young man - so many terrific scenes here, including a meeting wtih Donovan, who is a running theme and joke through the film (and a tidbit of imformation, it was Donavan, Baez and Dylan who wrote the cards you see in Subterranean Homesick Blues the night before in a hotel room - the better cards were done by Donovan because he was more 'artistically inclined' according to many reliable sources; regardless, the cards were done by all three...).<br /><br />Don't Look Back was the first \\"Rockumentary\\" in a real form that had ever been, and Pennebaker should be and has been applauded and rewarded for that.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|Have you ever wondered what events helped make James Bond into the man we have known for the last few decades?  Ever wanted to know how he achieved his `00' status or why he treats women the way that he does?  Well, if you do then you will no doubt want to watch the movie that is being called `the best Bond movie ever made'.  The movie I'm talking about of course is \\"007: Casino Royale\\".  After over 20 movies, the producers of the `James Bond' series felt it was time for a restart, a way to make Bond fresh for today's audiences.  So, what better way to do that than to begin this reboot of the franchise with the story that started it all, and let audiences everywhere discover just how James became Bond. <br /> <br />\\"007: Casino Royale\\" begins with a different kind of James Bond (Daniel Craig), as we are first introduced to him at a point in his career where he doesn't even have his `00' status as yet.  However, it doesn't take Bond long to achieve this level after he succeeds in assassinating two enemy agents in quick order, and the timing couldn't be better.  It turns out while James is becoming agent 007, a terrorist financier known as Le Chiffre is gambling heavily with his client's money.  It's a risky move for sure when playing with other people's money, especially when those people are terrorists, but it's a move that has paid off time and again with very lucrative profits.  But when Le Chiffre gambles his most recent client's money on the stock market and loses, he quickly realizes that in order to survive he will have to pay back the money in short order before the terrorists notice that their money is missing.  To accomplish this, Le Chiffre has organized a high-stakes poker tournament, and one he is confident that he will win.  That is until `M' (Judi Dench) the head of MI-6 assigns 007, who just so happens to be their best poker player, with the task of defeating Le Chiffre so that he will have no where to run except to the British government for sanctuary from the very terrorists that he used to work for.  To ensure that all goes smoothly, `M' has placed a Treasury agent named Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) to watch over James, but when they begin to fall for each other Le Chiffre sees this as an opportunity to stop Bond once and for all. <br /> <br />After more than 20 movies have utilized the character of `007', and 5 actors had previously played the part, it's hard to believe that MGM would want to just start over as if all that had never happened.  Especially if they expect audiences to go along with them on this little endeavor, and I'm sure the fact that the previous `Bond' movie \\"007: Die Another Day\\" being the most successful `007' film to date didn't make the decision any easier.  But as difficult as it was to understand MGM's reasoning, and as much skepticism regarding the casting of the first blonde James Bond, after viewing the movie I have to say all my skepticism, along with everyone else's was all for naught, and that MGM had made a very good choice. <br /> <br />\\"007: Casino Royale\\" is by far one of the best `James Bond' movies ever to be made, if not the absolute best.  The story for the movie was the most realistic of any `Bond' movie, and also had so much ground to cover, that it's surprising the movie didn't feel cluttered with the amount of groundwork that was laid for the already established franchise, but the writers delivered brilliantly.  One terrific choice, and yet was also one that was panned in the beginning, was the lack of gadgets that were to be included in this `Bond' movie, opting to go with a more realistic approach, and this decision proved to elevate the movie above its predecessors.  Assisting in making this movie become so terrific was the directing by Martin Campbell (\\"The Mask of Zorro\\"), who delivers an even better, more polished movie than his last foray into the world of James Bond when he launched Pierce Brosnan's career as MI-6's most famous agent in \\"007: Goldeneye\\", and proving that he was the right man to bring James Bond back to reality.  As far as the actor chosen to portray agent 007, Daniel Craig was superb, though panned by fans and critics as not looking the part, after the movie was finished I believe almost everyone is in agreement that he is one of the best Bond's ever in the franchise's history.  Craig's performance shows audiences a much more gritty, battle-hardened agent who will do what it takes to get the job done, while at the same time he can show a vulnerability that hadn't been seen before in these movies as a Bond that makes mistakes and sometimes loses.  It was nice to see Judi Dench return as `M', though for continuity this doesn't work since she didn't become `M' until the Pierce Brosnan movies, but that is a fact that can easily be overlooked, much like the various actors playing the title role.  Rounding out the main cast of characters is Eva Green as Vesper Lynd, the newest Bond girl, who James falls in love with only to have his heart torn apart, delivering him his most valuable lesson:  Trust no one. <br /> <br />Regardless of all the skepticism and nay-saying that surrounded this relaunch of Hollywood's most enduring franchise, in the end \\"007: Casino Royale\\" had the last word, proving to audiences and critics to never underestimate the man known as \\"Bond, James Bond\\". <br /> <br />\\"007: Casino Royale\\" is rated PG-13 for violence and sensuality.
B000N6TX1I|3.0|I had to watch all the special features before I could begin to appreciate the art of this movie, but I still can't say I enjoyed it. It's a dark, action packed, violently painful rendition of the near future of the Earth; a world that is so nearly destroyed that no one has been able to bear children for 18 years.<br /><br />You watch the violence and ugliness of the environment from one scene to the next only to find that there is one woman, indeed, who is pregnant, and who must be saved from those who would use her baby to enhance the status of those in power rather than admit that this baby is being born to an \\"illegal immigrant.\\" This is a miracle baby - it surely can't be an illegal immigrant, surely can't be poor, surely can't be Black! And yet, it is.<br /><br />The rest of the movie is about getting this mother and child to safety, and I wondered if I was watching a futuristic Mary and Joseph with the Baby Jesus - but I surely hope not. No child should have to be born in a world like that, nor should hope rest on said urchin's tiny shoulders. That is way too much responsibility to place on a child for damage they did not cause.<br /><br />Intriguing special effects in the case of watching the child be born. It's a high tech fetus with high-tech features that looks so real it fooled me.<br /><br />If any of this interests you, try it. As I say, I wasn't thrilled.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000092OVK Waterworld]]
B000LC55F2|5.0|The world of illusion is one that has entertained audiences worldwide for years and years, and now you will be taken behind the scenes to witness how some of these tricks are created, but also just how obsessive and dark this world can be.  The man responsible for showing you this side of magic, is none other than director Christopher Nolan, who has become one of Hollywood's most successful director's in recent years, with his films ranging from the confusing, sleeper hit \\"Memento\\", to the detective thriller \\"Insomnia\\", to DC Comics' caped crusader in \\"Batman Begins\\", and has managed to intrigue audiences every step of the way.  This latest effort \\"The Prestige\\", starring Hugh Jackman (`X-Men' trilogy) and Christian Bale (\\"Batman Begins\\"), proves to be no exception. <br /> <br />\\"The Prestige\\" tells the story of two rival magicians, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), who once upon a time had worked together to perform illusions, but after one fateful night tore these two friends apart, they are now the bitterest of enemies.  Desperately trying to learn each other's secrets, these two one-time friends will stop at nothing to defeat the other.  As their obsession grows more dangerous, sabotage and deceit become everyday affairs on their quest to be the greatest illusionist of their time. <br /> <br />\\"The Prestige\\" is one of those movies where you can't miss a second or else you may find yourself completely confused as to what's going on in the film.  There are several major twists within the story, with many minor ones thrown in along the way that will keep you on the edge of your seat wondering what will be coming at you next.  In some movies too many surprises or twists can bring about a movies eventual downfall.  For instance if there are too many twists that it appears the writers themselves lost track of where they were intending to go, and the movie suffers by becoming confusing and convoluted.  \\"The Prestige\\" avoids this pitfall,thanks to the excellent writing of director Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan.  Together they have managed to successfully craft a thoroughly engaging revenge movie that is unique, in that there is no clear cut hero in the movie.  Along with the revenge arc of the story, there are huge amounts of detail shown as to what went on behind the scenes of many of these magic tricks in the old days, which was really interesting, and surprising in some instances as to how far all of these magicians would go just to create an illusion for an audience.  This exploration into the somewhat darker side of magic is so intriguing because it's a part of that world that you haven't seen before.  Of course, the secrets revealed in this movie, may not have been all that secret of late, and are probably not even close to being how the magicians of today would create the same illusion, but it was still interesting to watch and showed me things I didn't know about. <br /> <br />Throughout this story the two lead characters, brilliantly portrayed by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale respectively, do so many underhanded things to one another that neither one is without a share in the blame for the destructive paths their lives have taken.  This makes the movie interesting to watch because you can't completely side with either character as the hero for the movie, which allows the audience to not choose sides and therefore see both sides to the movie more clearly.  The two main supporting characters are excellently played by Scarlett Johansson, whose character is hardly without her own moral shortcomings, and Michael Caine, who plays the one character that could probably be described as the moral center for the film.  The acting in this movie is truly excellent, and allows \\"The Prestige\\" to become another successful film for director Christopher Nolan. <br /> <br />By now, you have no doubt concluded that I really enjoyed this movie, and therefore highly recommend people to watch it.However, this is not a movie for everyone, as it is a much darker movie than even I anticipated.  So, if you're thinking that this is going to be a magical, special effects extravaganza, then you will be sorely disappointed.  But if you are looking for a very well-acted, dramatic, and intense movie-going experience, then \\"The Prestige\\" is definitely one movie to watch, and if you're like me you'll want to see it again once it's over. <br /> <br />\\"The Prestige\\" is rated PG-13 for violence.
0143038419|3.0|The premise of the book is intriguing. I love travel books, however, the author's need to be cute and possibly funny annoyed me too often.

B00005JPMX|5.0|This is my first TMNT movie. I was never really a TMNT fan but I decided to have an open mind and give it a try. My boyfriend convinced me to go see this and I was pleasently surprised. I thought it was very entertaining! The animation was great, the action was awesome, it had a lot of funny one-liners and I thought it had a strong plot. I liked the rivalry between the two brothers and I thought the movie carried a good message for kids about taking responsibility, working together and forgiving your family, etc. It's not the typical movie I am into but I really hope they make another one. This is more of a kids movie but good for adults also if you are looking for something fun and lighthearted. Another wonderful thing, in the theatre all the kids were so glued to the screen they were all SILENT! None of them made so much as a peep. Any movie that can make a bunch of 5-10 year old boys sit quiet with their hands in their lap must be pretty good! Simply amazing! Overall this was a great movie and I would watch it again!
B000MXPE7O|2.0|Rent, do not buy, this movie.  Glad I rented it and removed it from my wish list before purchasing.  Matt Damon sleepwalks through his role, with very little dialog.  Ms. Jolie is terribly mis-cast as the pregnant girlfriend/wife, but does her best with her role.  Lots of flashbacks, which are not always clearly communicated to the viewer.  I won't bother going over the story (which was told much better in \\"The Company\\" by Robert Littel (warning - get this in paperback -- it's a long but engaging story).<br /><br />And I thought the DaVinci Code was the most boring movie ever made . . .
B000LXHK2C|4.0|Taken for what it intends, this a great film.  Formulaic? Yes, but it's a formula done well.  Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe demonstrate that light-hearted romantic stories do not require a gut-wrenching tragedy or rivalry to propel a plot.  Pour yourself a glass of red wine (the good stuff) and relax as you enjoy charming characters in breathtaking scenery.  A good vacation from reality for a couple of bucks at your local vdeo store.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|I enjoyed this movie a great deal.  So did a great many others.  It took in more than $160 million in the U. S. and over $300 million worldwide.  Why?  Because everyone knows more about hard times than they care to admit.  We know what its like to be up against it financially, have a period in our lives when it is hard to pay the rent or make the mortgage payment.  While most of us haven't had to use a men's room as sleeping accommodations, we know what it is like to want to care for our children and have times when we can't provide for them as we would like. Most people know what it is like to have more meals of macaroni and cheese or ramen noodles than they would choose to have if they had more green in their wallets. Many more people know what a shutoff warning from the utility company looks like than would tell you about it.<br /><br />We know what it is like to have dreams and to pursue them under pressure and against tough odds.  We know what it is like to want to teach our kids about life and then later regret giving them our own disappointments rather than the truth and how that might sap their own dreams and vitality - the gifts of youth - and to want to take those words back.<br /><br />Almost all marriages have tough times.  Not every marriage collapses, but the pressures of life have killed marriages that could have made it under different circumstances.  We know what it is like to make a mistake in choosing a bad job and having to work our way out of it.<br /><br />For these reasons, and many more, we relate to this movie.  It is terrific.  And the performances by Will and Jaden Smith are something quite special.  Will Smith is always charismatic on the screen, but this time he wisely lets Jaden have that dramatic space and Will plays Chris Gardner, a real man under real pressure.  Chris is a brilliant man who didn't have the opportunities to develop his intellectual talents as he should have had.  He and his hard working wife made a tough business decision in trying to sell bone density scanners, but it was a product wasn't as accepted in the marketplace as they had hoped.  Now Linda (played with the right notes by Thandie Newton) has to work two shifts while their money gets spread thinner and thinner - to the point of evaporation.  A nice touch is when Linda pours the left over iced tea in their dinner glasses back into the pitcher.  Only people really hurting do that kind of thing.<br /><br />However, despite the hardship, this is a positive and heartwarming movie.  We root for everyone in the film.  We realize that a lot of the pain in the film is caused by mis-communication or a total lack of willingness or ability to simply go and explain the situation to another.  Maybe that was impossible and things would not have worked out as well if they had.  Still, we wish people would just say this or that to that person there.<br /><br />A terrific movie.

B000E5KJI4|4.0|I know I learned all about Greek history and mythology in high school, but that was too many years ago so I didn't know what in this movie was true to history and what was altered. Maybe my ignorance helped me enjoy the movie more than some. I thought the battle sequences were well done and the costuming excellent. Some of the characters didn't have much to do, while others we were given a good amount of depth to understand their motivations. Peter O'Toole owned the screen in his scene with Achilles asking for his son's body to be returned. Brad Pitt did a nice job with Achilles. The only complaint I have is the nihilistic way the character was written became a little irritating to deal with as the movie went on. Brian Cox is his usual nasty self as Agamemnon and it would have been nice to see Brendon Gleason have a bigger role as Menelaus. <br /> <br />My biggest trouble with Troy is the almost 3 hour length. It didn't need to be that long. A few scenes cut out or shortened would have made a tighter movie. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Troy and would recommend it.

0800141660|5.0|Born in Steventon, Hampshire in 1775, Jane Austen was one of two daughters of the Reverent George Austen and his wife Cassandra. She was educated in Oxford and in Southampton, finally attending a boarding school in the Abbey gatehouse in Reading, Berkshire. The environment provided by her home was conducive to writing and she often enacted plays for her family, something that gave her the opportunity to present her stories and develop the characters in depth.  <br /> <br />Jane Austen's works are imaginative, full of emotion and depicting relationships that transcend time. Jane Austen wrote about society, about propriety and about etiquette. She was highly critical of the snobbery with which the upper classes kept away from others. Her study of human flaws and personal relationships provide great material for the development of her characters.  <br /> <br />Jane Austen wrote Sense and Sensibility in 1811, this being her first published novel. This film provides a rare combination of a superb interpretation of the author's novel and a cast that turns it into a masterpiece.  <br /> <br />In the past, when a wealthy man died, for the most part, the male son would inherit his fortune. In Sense and Sensibility, Jane Austen brings forth the terrible consequences of this costume, for Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret, become impoverished after her husband dies. As it was expected, John inherites the estate, Norland.  <br /> <br />John promises his father that he will take care of his sisters and step-mother, but being married to a rather selfish woman, she stops him from doing he horonable thing. So, the Dashwood women are now seen as strangers in their own home and soon set out to find alternative living quarters. <br /> <br />The older Dashwood, Elinor is rather taken by the selfish sister in law's brother, a gentle and intelligent young man, who is to marry a woman of high rank, so given that Elinor has sense, she does not hope to see her love aspirations come to fruition. <br /> <br />The Dashwood women move to Barton Cottage, where a distant cousin rents them affordable quarters. Marianne is the romantic sister, who upon spraining her ankle, meets a handsome young man who carries her to safety in the rain, and romance appears to strike. But the young man announces that he must return to London on business and the hopes of Marianne are shattered. <br /> <br />As Elinor Dashwood, Emma Thompson is powerful, funny as the Dashwood sister that possesses enough sense to enchant us all. Her sister, played by Kate Winslet, is a romantic who attracts several suitors, while Elinor deals with Hugh Grant, the person who ultimately brings this romance to a sheer delight. <br /> <br />The costumes are excellent. The setting of the manicured English countryside allows us to see the environment the author intended for the development of her wonderful characters.
B00003CXCD|5.0|I remember the first time I saw this movie, as a child, with the absolutely radiant Audrey Hepburn in her first major role as the naive, protected Princess determined to have her day of freedom and to escape from her overscheduled, dreary routine.<br /><br />  How lucky Hepburn was to have Gregory Peck as a costar, a man who was gallant (and wise) enough to insist she be listed as a costar, right up there alongside him in the credits. The studio wanted to use the words \\"and introducing Audrey Hepburn\\" in the credits but Peck believed -and turned out to be right- that she would win the Academy Award for her excellent portrayal, which may seem a bit over the top to today's audiences but absolutely charmed viewers at the time (I still love the movie).<br /><br />  The story behind this movie is nearly as fascinating as the movie itself and it is worth buying this Collector's Edition to get some of that behind the scenes info in the special sections. Frank Capra was set to direct the movie but when he found out that the blacklisted Dalton Trumbo was the scriptwriter, he bailed. That's when Wyler stepped in, letting Trumbo do the writing but having another writer \\"front\\" for him. It took years for Trumbo to be duly recognized.<br /><br />  I do believe this film is best seen in black and white, as it was intentionally filmed this way. Why? Because it was shot on location, in Rome, at a time when movies were often filmed in Hollywood, with backdrops to give the illusion of another country. But not THIS time. However, Wyler feared that if the movie was shot in color, Rome might overshadow the story itself. As it is, some have called Rome the third \\"character\\" in this film and it benefits greatly by being shot on location.
B000GY729M|5.0|Nice album. I picked up Hot Fuss on an impulse because one of my friends was always singing somebody told me. The first time I listened to it only a couple songs stood out to me. So I listened to it again cause I figured I spent 15 bucks on this thing. I'm getting my money's worth. To make a long story short I loved it. So the day Sam's Town came out I went to the store and bought it. My first listen through I was looking for those songs that you know that you will hear on the radio eventually. Nothing really stood out to me besides When we were young until I got to Exitlude and I thought this one aint to bad. Then I let it cycle through again and was I hooked. It only leaves my car now when I want to listen to it in my room.<br /><br />I hear people saying that they rushed this albulm and that they need to take more time then 2 years to make a new albulm. I say Bull. Have they ever checked out how quickly the Beatles nocked out albums? They even recorded their debut albulm in about 10 hours. Please Plese Me and WIth the Beatles were both in 63, Plus the Magical Mystery Tour came out the same year as the legedary Sgt. Peppers, with the White Albulm coming soon after. Plus you have Rubber Soul which came out Dec, 65 and Revolver in Aug, 66. Did I mention 4 of those are in the Rolling Stone top 500 albulms of all time.<br /><br />Now I'm not comparing The Killers to The Beatles by any means, that just isn't a good argument to me.<br /><br />Sam's Town start off the albulm and is one of my favorates on the cd. Constantly changing but flowing smoothly. Flowers has some nice raw vocals on this song.<br /><br />Enterlude and Exitlude are both nice sing alongs thought they are both pretty short they hold that albulm together as book ends.<br /><br />When We were young is the first single and the one that I am sure many people bought the albulm. Some compare to Mr. Brightside but really has not a whole lot on common except they're both Killers songs. This is much more guitar driven the Brightside. Great track.<br /><br />Bling seems to me to be inluenced a lot by U2. Flowers voice has a haunting effect to me. Kind of like Lennon on &#34;A Day In the Life.&#34; I love the bridge on this song. It just kinds of repeats higher and higher but just soars to a climax before ending with a mellow outro.<br /><br />For Reasons unknown starts off reminding me of My Charona (which I am sure I didin't spell right).<br /><br />Read My Mind is another great track seems to get a lot of radio play. At least when I've been listening to it. Makes me think of my home town. &#34;On the corner of main street... can you read my mind.&#34; I love the sound in the background during the begging and end of the song that sounds like the wind blowing through a tunnel. Well written song with some very catchy lyrics.<br /><br />This is the only song that I have any gripe with, though it is still one of my favorate. . &#34;When everybod else refrained, Uncle Johnny did cocaine.&#34; Who saw that rhyme coming. Just sticks out a little to much for me I guess, but the rest of the song is well crafted. One of my favorate things about the band is when the others due some vocals together. It's just got this sing a long catchiness going on.<br /><br />Bones is yet another great song. It reminds me more of Hot Fuss then any of the others on the albulm. Great verses and an awesome chorus. Ussually I am not a big fan of saxes in most music out side of blues but it fits in so nicely with Synths. Flowers sounds great during the bridge when there arn't any drums or brass. Stands out at just the right point of the albulm.<br /><br />My List has some coolest synth work that I have heard in a long time. This is the slowest song on the albulm. But shows a depth that is more evident here then anywhere else on the cd.<br /><br />The river is wild is another of my favorates on the cd because of Flower's vocals. The song just has this energy that I like. Fast slow fast slow. Great Lyrics and bridge.<br /><br />My favorate is Why do I Keep counting. It is just so diverse in sound but all fits together seemlessly. Love this one.<br /><br />This albulm deffinenly shows a growth and maturity of the band in all the right directions. Flowers has nearly mastered his songwriting skills.  Their sound changed yet it is not different and if you loved the first one, than this one is a great move in their progression and is definently worth picking. I see a bright future.reat Lyrics and bridge. <br /> <br />My favorate is Why do I Keep counting. It is just so diverse in sound but all fits together seemlessly.

B000ELJBAK|5.0|Gilmour, of course, is best known as the guitarist for Pink Floyd.  In 1978 he put out this his first solo album of shorter songs mostly in the 4 to 5 minute range.  If I remember correctly the two guys he recruited to perform on the album with him had been in a band with Gilmour when they were kids.  The bass player is Rick Willis who has had stints with both Foreigner and Bad Company, and the drummer was Willie Wilson.  I have always liked this album.  The songs are relatively simple, but all contain that distinctive David Gilmour guitar that is uniquely his.  Gilmour's voice is also one of a kind with it's soothing quality that always gave Pink Floyd that special touch.  The album is a mix of instrumentals and vocal tunes that reflect a similar sound to what fans are used to in Floyd.  The lyrics, while not as profound as Roger Waters, are all decent and enjoyable.  Highlights include, \\"Mihalis\\", \\"There's No Way Out Of Here\\", \\"So Far Away\\", \\"Raise My Rent\\", and \\"I Can't Breathe Anymore\\".  The bottom line is if you like Gilmour's work with Pink Floyd you will probably like this nice little disc.
B000002WPI|5.0|Not many groups can make a slammin classic album and not many can carry a whole coast on their backs but Wutang was able to do that with this Masterpiece of an album. For starters everybody shines on here like ODB(RIP) rips Shame On A N***A to pieces and has an excellent verse on Protect Ya Neck. Inspectah Deck kills it on Clan In Da Front and Protect Ya Neck and others. Method Man of course was on fire back with Method Man. Raekwon and Ghostface murders Can It Be All So Simple plus Rae's verse on C.R.E.A. M. is still potent to this day. And of course RZA perfected the beats and his rhymes were superb on Wutang Clan Aint Nothing To F*** Wit and Tearz. Standout Tracks: SHAME ON A N****, CLAN IN DA FRONT, C.R.E.A.M., CAN IT BE AL SO SIMPLE, METHOD MAN(M E T H O D Man), DA MYSTERY OF CHESSBOXIN', PROTECT YA NECK, WUTANG CLAN AINT NOTHING TO F*** WIT, TEARZ etc. Filler: NONE! Bottom Line: Wutang Clan's first album is a classic that is one of the best albums of 93. The whole album can be listened to from beginning to end without skipping tracks. Its unfortunate that they got lazy after Wutang Forever but thats life. I suggest you pick it up if you can because albums like these are hard to find. Its like somebody is intentionally trying to erase our memory of what hip hop truly is.
0440539811|1.0|Why did I waste two months of free time on this novel? 805 pages of pointless ramblings that just left me scratching my head. This book is jam packed with explicit violence, impetuous sex, black masses, and unabashed drug abuse.     There was a plot at some point, or was there? How does everything tie together? Content that may have been thought provoking nuggets are lost in a sea of nonsensical circuitous paragraphs that would jump from one character's viewpoint to another.     This book started off slow, continued to be slow, and ended painfully slow. I kept waiting for a payoff, given all the time invested in this novel, but it never came.
0743454537|2.0|This is the first Jodi Picoult novel I've read, and I am not particularly impressed.  I was looking forward to delving into this novel, but after a few chapters it became apparent that this is \\"fast-food\\" commercial fiction.  It is a page-turner, but there is no depth to the characters.  The main weakness of the book is that it is a dialogue-driven narrative, but the dialogue is poorly written.  I was not at all convinced that the words and thoughts spoken by 13 year old Anna could possibly have come from a 13 year old girl.  They sounded exactly like the words that a grown woman would put into the mouth of a 13 year old girl. <br /> <br />The subject matter is interesting, and the plot is reasonably good, but the characters just don't ring true.
B000001E21|5.0|Wow.  One word for this album - AWESOME! <br /> <br />I just recently bought all the post-Hysteria CD's so I could play catch-up with this old favorite band of mine, and this release is really a shining star.  Def Leppard showed with X and Slang that they can blaze forward with the changing trends, but Retroactive is more of a return to their pre-Pyromania sound - but BETTER!  The very first track alone - Desert Song - makes the purchase worth it, and there are numerous tracks in addition to that that just blow me away:  Ring of Fire, I Wanna Be Your Hero, and the acoustic and electric versions of Two Steps Behind and I Miss You in a Heartbeat.  <br /> <br />HIGHLY recommended.  I'll probably buy another copy soon as a stand-by since I have a feeling I'll wear this one out pretty quickly....

B00000FCBC|4.0|There is very few artist that can cover songs and make them just as good or better then the orignals. Metallica falls in between. I thought there playing on the cd could have been better. What is with Lars in the booklet looking like Bam from Viva La Bam anyways? Did Bam steal the look from Lars? I love Motorhead and I thought the covers for those songs were terriable. So What is probably my faviorte track on this whole collection.
B000AGTPUU|4.0|Either you get on the train or you don't... And as long as you continue to get on the train, you'll grasp the meaning of Christmas. The TRUE meaning of Christmas. But you have to be willing to get on.<br /><br />This movie was a great adaptation of the classic story. I must admit I was a tad bit wigged out by the animation. It was just oogey in some ways. Realistic at times and, at other times, so unbelievably fake...<br /><br />I couldn't decide if I liked the animation or not. Still can't. But the story itself is worth the struggle I had with the animation.<br /><br />Get on board! You'll be glad you did.
B000002HRE|3.0|This album was a complete letdown. Load was an excellent hard rocking cd and I had faith that this band didnt all together suck after the black album....well this album wasnt that great. I dont like the orignal Unforgiven, so why would I like part 2? The rest of the album did have weird stuff, it didnt pan out but at least they tried it. Ill give it an anther spin to see how it goes.
B00005JM0B|3.0|I'd almost like to give this movie 3.5 stars...but not enough to upgrade my overall rating to 4 stars. The movie had great special effects and I enjoyed the T-X villain, but I felt so cheated by the ending. I also really felt like Cameron should have done more to bring back Linda Hamilton's character. Paid her more, given her more incentives or just written in a heroic role to which she couldn't have said no. Claire Danes is NOT an action star and, while I think she did okay in the role of action star, the movie was handicapped by her whiney presence along with that of the new \\"John Connor.\\"<br /><br />What I really hated was how the \\"Good\\" Terminator character got sent back... or should I say WHO sent him back. The circumstances surrounding it, etc. I really felt, as I said, cheated by so many things in this movie. It leaves you with a very hopeless feeling of the future, unlike T2 in which the viewer was left feeling incomplete but perhaps in a more positive frame of mind.<br /><br />Not a great way to \\"end\\" the series if this is, indeed, Arnie's last foray into the Terminator world.
B00000099Y|5.0|Awesome album. The outstanding musicianship of this band bring you to a new world. Its like getting high legally.
B000I2JKC4|5.0|I don't know what people are thinking giving this 1 and 2 stars. Chevy Chase is a comedic genius!! His delivery and Improv ability is spot on! He has a way of delivering an otherwise boring line that makes anything he says funny! This man can make a comedy out of reading the PHONE BOOK!<br /><br />Christmas Vacation reunites Chevy Chase and Beverley D'Angelo as they decide to hold Christmas Festivities at their house this year. When the two sides of the family come together, it's not Auld Lang Syne. It's not a \\"Wonderful\\" Life but it's a WONDERFULLY Hilarious Holiday Romp!! An undeniable part of my holiday tradition.
B000002H33|5.0|Honestly the only thing I can say about this album is that its the single greatest album ever produced. Pure musical genius. I wish i could give it more stars so i could express how amazing this album is. From Kurks outstanding guitar to Lars's thrash drumming i cant find any room for improvement. It saddens me to see them produce the [...] they did in the 90's. Long live the gods of thrash metal!
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|Many movies have been set in prisons, but none with the story of this magnitude. Not one with characters so endearing, so believable. I do believe it's in part due to the wonderful writing of Stephen King's story, from which this film is adapted, but some of the credit has to go to the actors and directors.<br /><br />Red and Andy are like peas and carrots. Like Peanut butter and jelly. They're yin and yang.<br /><br />An uplifting story with a great central message. The prison has your body but you don't have to let it steal your mind... or your heart.
B000G75AE8|4.0|This is the sound form the God Hates Us All album and even with the return of the old drummer, it seems the sound will stay. Im not complaining cause I love the raw anger of the \\"new slayer.\\" Although this wasnt as good as God Hates Us All its was still awesome.
B000O178BY|5.0|Year Zero is definitly the best work of NIN since The Downward Spiral. It is beautiful and very artistic, though it may be dark beauty. From the first track Hyperpower!, that pulls you in with a noisy drum instrumental, to the angst of Capital G, and the soft piano of Another Version of the Truth, this is worth your time and money. It has good beats and drum work by Josh Freese, and Saul Williams guest vocals on Survivalism, which reached #1 on Modern Rock Charts. If you liked The Downward Spiral and the hard to digest The Fragile, you will love this new installment of the NIN discography. It is something you never heard before.
B0000028M7|5.0|Sound, Sound, Sound. This band brings ear candy in plenty. From the distorted singing of Them Bones to the riffs of Rooster this album is definitely a treat for the ears!
0142000655|5.0|I really am not sure how I should review this book.  East of Eden is mind blowing.  It is, without a doubt, Steinbeck's greatest creation.  I have not read all of the Steinbeck canon but I have read enough of his major works to know that this tops them all.<br /><br />You'll hear everyone throwing around stuff like \\"retelling of Cain and Abel\\" but that is misleading.  Yes, it *is* a retelling of Cain and Abel (twice, actually) but it is so much more than that.  Don't constrict your enjoyment of this book based on its parallels.  Take it for what it is.  It's a magnificent epic story that has some of the deepest characters in American literature.  As an example, Kate is one of the most evil characters I've ever read, but she's not just a cardboard character that generally represents evil.  Underneath her vile loathsome exterior you can catch the stirrings of a great conflict within her, a desperate desire for love.  But Steinbeck doesn't spell it out for you.  He doesn't plop it in your lap and say, \\"Think this now about this character.\\"  He let's you figure it out.  He lets you fill in the blanks.  And it's not always too easy to figure out.  Don't expect a facile read.  But don't expect a boring read either.  I never wanted to put this book down.<br /><br />John Steinbeck's characters are amazing.  That is his charm.  Nobody is all good or all evil, nobody is unconflicted, nobody is always a certain way.  And isn't that how we are in real life?  \\"East of Eden\\" has characters that are so real that they almost seem unreal.  It's not until one looks deeper within the characters that one sees that what a character says isn't always what he means, or that what a character does is not always what he wants to do, etcetera.<br /><br />This book is absolutely mandatory for anyone who calls themself a Steinbeck fan.  This book is mandatory for anyone who claims to be a lover of American literature.  I would suggest this book to aspiring authors and even actors and directors to get insight into real characters, developed characters, characters that are so human that they don't make sense sometimes.<br /><br />Anyway, read this book.  It's worth all 600 pages and then some.directors to get insight into real characters, developed characters, characters that are so human that they don't make sense sometimes.   <br /> <br />Anyway, read this book.

B000062YB1|5.0|One of the great metal albums of our time. From the drumming to the guitar alls that can be said is amazing.
B000NA1OXY|3.0|WOW, Is this the same Avril Lavigne that Turned The Pop Music World Upside only 5 years ago? I am Shocked at how Glossy and Popish this Cd Sounds. Its like she died and came back as Britney Spears! I agree with the one reviewer who compared the \\"Girlfriend\\" song To that Toni Basil Song \\"Hey Mickey\\" from the 80's. When I first heard Girlfriend, I thought the same exact thing, its just like that 80's Mickey Song.Toni Basil is probably calling her lawyer now, LOL! Then Again,  Avril is 22 years old now , she is more mature and she is now a newly married lady Sooo, I take that all into account which is why I am giving the cd 3 stars(I am being very generous). I dont really care for any of the songs on this cd, Avril's vocals are fine, I just dont care for the style. I guess when one grows up , they lose their edge. Still, Avril Does Sound Happy on the CD(YAWN)! If you liked The Old Avril(tough punk chick) , you probably woudnt like this cd but HEY if you are into Britney, Christina and Jessica , This Cd is for you!
B000NA1OXY|3.0|This album is not the same as you may be used to hearing from Avril. The songs are not as \\"dark\\" as on her other albums. I find them rather annoying actually. I mostly just wanted to let all of you know who are thinking of buying it that.... <br /> <br />Wal-Mart and Target have only EDITED versions of this CD as far as I am aware. I found a quote from her online today stating that they did edited versions for Target and Wal-Mart. They are not even marked edited, so I didn't know the difference until I popped it in my car! A little irritated, but turns out I don't like the album anyway.
B000N6U0DS|5.0|Will Smith has acting chops! After the usual hero roles playing mostly himself, Will digs deep to portray a flawed bone density scanner salesman trying to keep his family together. The scanner business is not as profitable as he imagined and after sinking all his money in a venture to sell these machines he's down to his last few machines and last few bucks, the landlord is threatening to kick them out, his wife(Thandie Newton in a finely wired performance) is at the end of her rope, his car is towed away for unpaid parking tickets, his son(played by his real-life son, Jaden Smith is in a daycare center in Chinatown where he mostly watches tv). Can it get any worse? It does. This film does not pull any punches or play it for cheap maudlin sentiment, you take this man's journey and you feel his angst, disappoinment's and eventual joy. When you are down and out and everything is going wrong, hang on and never let go, Chris Gardner's life is an example of what perserverance can pay off. The man is now a multi-millionaire. I loved this movie.
B000KRN67C|5.0|Rotting Christ's \\"Theogonia\\" is definitely a contender for the best metal album of 2007 and who would have thought it?  I have known about Rotting Christ for about ten years however I have been a casual listener.  The last Christ album I bought was \\"A Dead Poem\\" which was about 10 years ago. I also own \\"Triarchy of the Lost Lovers\\" and although I enjoyed both albums they didn't strike me extremely hard.  At least not hard enough to buy more of their records, I was then browsing Metal Hammer magazine and I saw that Rotting Christ had a new album coming out.  Excuse my ignorance but I didn't even realize the band was still together.  I mean lets face it, finding an album of theirs in a main chain record store is not an easy feat.  Well the article caught my interest and I thought what the heck I'll check out their new album to see what the sound like ten years after \\"A Dead Poem\\".  Well to make a long story short I had to special order \\"Theogonia\\" I guess the name Rotting Christ scares a lot of record store salesmen away.<br /><br />From the first 60 seconds of the first track I was blown away.  This was melodic black metal in it's grandest form.  What is even more amazing is each track after the first seemed to get better and better.  Actually to be completely honest after listening to this album numerous times I can not name any highlight tracks because they are all that good.  The whole record is one complete epic metal journey.  Any band that is thinking about recording an epic album needs to listen to \\"Theogonia\\" first to see how a true epic metal record should be done.  Rotting Christ completely caught me off guard with this release.  I knew I would probably like this album but I had no idea I would enjoy it this much.  The musicianship on this record is top notch.  I would recommend to any one who enjoys black metal, epic metal, or just plain heavy metal in general to pick up \\"Theogonia\\" In my opinion it has the capability of being the metal release of the year although it will not get the recognition it deserves because of the band's name.  I do know one thing I now have a lot of back catalogue I have to purchase and catch up on from these Greek gods of metal.ugh it will not get the recognition it deserves because of the band's name.

B000K7VHQE|5.0|a road movie unlike the cheap thrills of RV or other junk like that..this movie aims higher then cheap laughs or happy feelings..there's a depth to it that earns every laugh you get and there are quite a few..a brilliant cast, led by Alan Arkin, the codgy old grandfather, Steve Carrel, the suicidal brother of Toni Collete, a mother trying to keep the family running, and frayed from it. The laughs do not start until after the family is on the road and headed to Cali for the lil Miss Sunshine contest, where Olive aspires to be a beauty queen. There's something wonderfully uplifting and heartwarming about this movie but not in your typical Hollywood bloated way, and laughs are real belly jumpers not those little chuckl laughs. Love it! Highly recommended.
B00078JZ92|5.0|If you are viewing this item right now you probably already know about the significance of this album. I wrote a review for 'Lola vs. Powerman and the Moneygoround' and I will state many of the same things about this album. I have owned the old domestic Reprise edition for years now and just recently picked up this pressing. The mono sound quality is superior and the booklet is handsome and much more informative. The stereo versions on this CD are a bit lousy in comparison to the first 15 tracks, but who cares? You will not regret buying this import in lieu of the older, more common Reprise pressing. I have not, however, heard the 3-CD Special Edition, nor do I plan to. This version is very pleasing for those who don't want two extra CDs that are likely to be stored away to collect dust.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|admit it, this Bond franchise needed some major changes after Pierce Brosnan and Timothy Dalton, who were fine in their own right but neither really measured up to Connery or the best of Moore. Talk about changes! Whoa, you got a blonde, blue-eyed James Bond going back to his roots earning his stripes as a 007 agent. When asked if he, wants his martini shaken or stirred? Bond replys, do I look like I care! This is of course right after he loses at poker to his target but he finds a way to get back in the game and get his man. This Bond has more depth, character and is a bit more raw then any Bond you know. I loved this film, it's a love story and action film brilliantly woven together to completely update the Bond series and give it new life. There are several scenes that just stay in my head, an intoxicating foot chase, a shower scene with clothes on that show more humanity then most Bond films, and the ending where you hear that famous line as the very last line of the movie. This is brilliant movie, Daniel Craig is Oscar worthy.
B000024D4R|5.0|Okay, I'm no stoner, but I'll freely admit you have to be in a very relaxed mood to enjoy Floyd's music. How you achieve said relaxed state is up to you (and probably is what led to their reputation as a \\"stoner-rock\\" band). I mean, you gotta be in a laid-back mood to appreciate their classic albums, becuase they're all about atmosphere.<br /><br />Except this one.<br /><br />Yeah, there's a lot of sound effects on Animals, but they're used in a different way than they were on Dark Side and the like. They're used to create a VERY unsettling, rather than relaxed mood. Example: that part on Dogs when Roger (yeah, it's Roger and not David singing), says \\"Dragged down by the stone... stone... stone... stone... stone... stone... stone...\\", and you're still hearing the word \\"stone\\" something like five minutes later (yeah, it's MUCH longer than five minutes - 17:08, to be precise). Scares the hell out of me. But is it not supremely cool?<br /><br />Another thing that sets Animals apart from the group's other '70s albums is that it's a guitar album. Dave Gilmour is a really great guitarist, and he gets PLENTY of chances to shine. Like on Dogs, where he's soloing for ten minutes or so. GREAT song, by the way. When I first heard it, I thought they should've tied it up a bit. I've changed my mind now, that's for sure! Sheep is another killer guitar song, especially those riffs he plays during the fadeout. He also busts out a talkbox (surprise!) on Pigs, which is probably the best moment on the album. Gilmour fans will drool all over Animals. And I'm a Gilmour fan. Hey, what a coincidence!<br /><br />Okay, onto the concept. It's sort of a rewrite of Animal Farm (very cool book, read it if you haven't), with the dogs being the ruthless, greedy businessmen; the pigs being the greedy, self-centered leaders who will stop at nothing for self-advancement, and the sheep are the common people who rise up and... wait, then I'd give away the ending!<br /><br />The non-concept songs kinda suck. Two of 'em, or should I say one divided into two parts. I speak of Pigs on the Wing. I don't see why this was added, completely unneeded. Get rid of them, and this is Floyd's best album. Now it's second to only Dark Side.of 'em, or should I say one divided into two parts. I speak of Pigs on the Wing. I don't see why this was added, completely unneeded.

B000O178BY|3.0|Year Zero is much more electronic and noisey than anything nin has done in a while. <br />I actually enjoyed most of the music in this album and I'd pay for an instrumental version, but the vocals are bland and the lyrics are trite and uninspired. <br />If you like hearing people whine about how bad they think the future will be, you're sure to love it.

0812550706|5.0|I am the daughter of a police officer and a college-bound student. I am warranted  <br /> <br />to speak about Ender's Game, because it was a requirement for my English class and  <br /> <br />unlike some of my fellow classmates, I actually read the book. I enjoyed the book,  <br /> <br />although I had my doubts at the beginning. It is a journey unlike any other I have  <br /> <br />partaken in. I personally am a fantasy-type girl and this was my first true Science fiction  <br /> <br />novel; so I read it with only Star Wars to compare it to. I have read many award winning  <br /> <br />books and unrecognized books in both categories. I found good and bad in both. I like  <br /> <br />new experiences, so when I was handed the book, I tried not to judge: although, I didn't  <br /> <br />really like the first two pages, but don't let that fool you; all together it is a ground  <br /> <br />breaking book, that changed my views on a few things. <br /> <br /> Now don't worry. I won't spoil anything for you, but I will give my insight on the  <br /> <br />book. I love the characters that Card created; souls tortured by: destiny, their strengths,  <br /> <br />and weaknesses. Another thing I admire is the twist and turns the author sends you  <br /> <br />through. I didn't like the book at times, because the author would ramble about  <br /> <br />unimportant information for a paragraph or two. I really like when Ender plays the  <br /> <br />fantasy game, because it gives you real insight into Ender's thoughts.  <br /> <br /> Card is one of those authors who right when you think you know where the story  <br /> <br />is going; it goes in a different direction by changing the characters location or situation,  <br /> <br />leaving you uneasy of the outcome. Although the characters do talk, most of the book is  <br /> <br />narration. Card explains so much that a page or two won't have any dialogue just  <br /> <br />narration. To Card it is important to capture what hischaracter is seeing or feeling. Card  <br /> <br />uses many literary techniques in Ender's Game: characterization, creative license,  <br /> <br />dialogue, dramatic irony, imagery, irony, parallelism, and symbolism. Most of the literary  <br /> <br />techniques are in the narrations. The audience that Card is targeting is more than science  <br /> <br />fiction geeks; he is targeting children with family problems who can relate to Ender.  <br /> <br />Ender's Game is an incredible book and you should read it! <br />
B00005YW4H|5.0|My baby daughter is a screamer, especially between the hours of 5pm and 8pm or whenever we are trapped on the freeway.<br /><br />I met an amazing lady who is an au-pair that recommended this CD as a baby calmer.  She said that none of the rest of Nora's CD's works quite like this one.<br /><br />Let me tell you, it is not a joke.  This CD has truly stopped many a melt-down within the last week.  If you have a screecher, try this album out, it works, I am not kidding!<br /><br />All of that aside, Nora's voice is just beautiful and the music really is mellow and relaxing.  So count me as well as my angry baby as two huge fans, would highly recommend this album!
B000EOTAM6|5.0|This is a really fun sci-fi movie to watch. This is a different story than movie in this genre and is a solid one at that. I did like the action of the \\"heroin\\" and does break all of the \\"sterotypes\\" of the \\"weak\\" woman figure. Bravo to the writer and director of this film for building a solid story with a strong woman as the heroin. The special effects were excellent in this movie as well as the acting of the actors. I do recommend this movie to anyone that loves sci-fi flicks with a little twist to the story.

0618680004|5.0|Dawkins stated purpose of his new book is to convert theists to atheists.  I've read the book and 150 of the (as of this writing)711 reviews posted on Amazon, and found 1 post of someone who said they had \\"deconverted\\" but provided no further details, plus a few posts of people who said they were agnostics before, but now are atheists after, reading the book.  I could not find any posts in this sample of people writing something along the lines of \\"I was a firm believer in God but this book has opened my eyes and now I'm an atheist.\\"  Many of the posted reviews were written by atheists already. <br />  Dawkins has written an excellent book, and I believe his arguments are unanswerable by theists, and although many of them have tried in their posts here, their responses (by the minority who have a modicum of literacy)reflect basic misunderstandings of science in general and what Dawkins wrote in particular.  The interesting question here is, why has the book failed?  Actually, the reason is simple--because Dawkins is right.  A delusion by definition is a fixed, false belief that can not be changed by the facts.  The reason WHY people hold on so strongly to these delusional belief systems is what is really intriguing, and although Dawkins does go into this to some extent, I think Pascal Boyer's \\"Religion Explained\\" and Scott Atran's book explore this issue in more detail.
159562015X|5.0|The strengthsfinder 2.0 is a wonderful extention of the strengthsfinder that we have all taken and learned so much about ourselves from.  Rath was wise to update the descriptions - narrowing the focus of the themes, yet leaving the themes consistent with the first strengthsfinder to create continuity from one version to the next.<br /><br />Nice job with strengthsfinder 2.0 - I will be looking forward to more great material from Tom Rath.
B000DZ7V7W|5.0|This is one of my favorite records from the best female piano player in popular music. These blues are played out and sung by Nina in her vocal prime and you can hear the sound of her southern roots, in her playin and her voice, better here than just about any of her other albums. Get it, you'll listen to it back to front, over and over. Complex woman, simple songs, great music, for those who like their music to be, well music.

0142000663|5.0|Oddly, I first read John Steinbeck's classic tale of the 1930's depression, Grapes of Wrath, as a result of listening to Woody Guthrie's also classic Dustbowl Ballads. In that album Woody sings/narrates the trials and tribulations of the Joad family as they get the hell out of drought-stricken Oklahoma and headed for the land of milk and honey in California. After listening to that rendition I wanted to get the full story and Steinbeck did not fail me. His tightly-woven story stands as a very strong exposition of the plight of rural America as they tried to make sense of a vengeful God, unrelenting Nature and the down-side of the American dream. For those who have seem Walker Evans's and other photographers pictures of the Okies, Arkies, etc. of the period this is the story behind those forlorn, if stoic, faces.<br /><br />The story line is actually very simple. The land in Oklahoma was played out, the banks nevertheless were pressing for payment or threatening foreclosure and for the Joads, as for others, time had run out. In classic American tradition they pulled up stakes and headed west to get a new start. With great hopes and no few illusions they set out as a family for the sunny and plentiful California of their dreams. Their struggle along the way is a modern day version of the struggles of the old Westward heading wagon trains-including the causalities. But, that is not the least of it. Apparently they had not read Frederick Jackson Turner's thesis that the frontier was gone- the land was taken. The bulk of the story centers of what happened when they get to the golden land-and it is not pretty. Day labor, work camps, strike action, murder, and mayhem-you know, California, the real California of the day. Not the Chamber of Commerce version. In short, as Woody sang, no hope if you aint got the do re mi.<br /><br />Grapes of Wrath was made into a starkly beautiful film starring a young Henry Fonda as Tom Joad. On a day when you are not depressed it is a film you want to see, if only for the photography. So here is the list. Listen to Woody sing the tale. Watch Henry Fonda to act it out. And by all means read Steinbeck. He had an ear for the 1930's struggle of the Okies and their ilk as they hit California. What happened to those people later and their influence on California culture and those who didn't make it are chronicled by others like Howard Fast and Nelson Algren.

But for this period your man is Steinbeck.
0790729385|5.0|This is simply a wonderful film. Everybody knows about the head-spinning and vomitting, but no-one ever mentions the brilliant direction, fabulous use of sound and stunning imagery, such as in the first 12 minutes of the film.<br /><br />The next section of the film develops the characters, and until at 75 minutes in the film Mrs MacNeil meets Karras and begs him to see her daughter. This scene (\\"And, how do you go about getting an exorcism?\\") is very powerful. Ellen Burstyn is outstanding, and should have won the best actress Oscar in 1973 for this film rather than Glenda Jackson.<br /><br />Most people will be familiar with the last section of the film and if the effects look a little dated it doesn't detract from the raw power of the film. There are great supporting roles from Max Von Sydow and Lee J Cobb.<br /><br />The UK film critic Mark Kermode (who is always right!) claims this as the greatest film of all time. Whilst it wouldn't be my choice it is certainly amongst the best I've ever seen and I strongly recommend it.
B0000AUHQT|3.0|THIS REVIEW WAS WRITTEN AS A REVIEW FOR THE BOOK BY F. SCOTT FITZGERALD. MOST OF THE MAIN POINTS HERE ALSO RELATE TO THE MOVIE. HOWEVER, IF YOU HAVE A CHOICE READ THE BOOK. ROBERT REDFORD AND MIA FARROW ACT TOO WOODENLY TO CONVEY THE REAL PATHOS OF JAY GATSBY'S STRUGGLE AND ITS CAUTIONARY TALE- THE VERY RICH ARE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM US.    <br /> <br /> <br />One would have to be rather pedantic not recognize that F. Scott Fitzgerald was an important novelistic voice of the Jazz Age in post World War I America. Certainly not the only voice of that age but the voice which best exemplifies the tensions between the mores of `old wealth' and the emerging sources of `new wealth' that were produced by the huge amount of money available, mainly through government contracts  as result of the war or riches gained through the illegal liquor trade. That is the sociological underpinning that drives Fitzgerald's work. This is no better example of those strivings than the Great Gatsby.  If nothing else it is a dramatic enactment of the strivings of the new money to `make it' in the world of high society, one way or another. And what better way to do that than in the age old tradition of buying one's way into that society through marriage. This is the modern American version of that story. <br /> <br />And the story itself? One Jay Gatsby, the former Jimmy Ganz, freshly reinventing himself after indeterminate service in the American military in World War I  and loaded with cash from questionable financial resources, attempts to win, or rather re-win the affections of one Daisy Buchanan his vision of the perfect life companion and exemplar of the `old money' crowd that he wishes to crash. One little complication, however, gets in the way. She has found herself married to a brutish but wealthy member of that `old money' crowd. Gatsby's fumbling but lavish attempts to lure her away from the high society of Long Island, then the summer watering hole of the `old money', forms the coreof the story. Gatsby's trial and tribulations on the way as narrated by Nick Carroway (and Gatsby's somewhat unwitting accomplice in the matter) keeps the story line going until the final deadly ending. The morale- the very rich are indeed very different from you or I. Moreover, someone else will always have to pick up the messes they have made for themselves. They merely move on.  This may serve as a cautionary tale for that time and possibly today. Certainly nobody has chronicled the end of the age of American innocence signaled by the Jazz Age better than Fitzgerald. <br /> <br />A word on literary merits. According to the inevitable changes in literary fashion as well as literary politics Fitzgerald, for long a leading figure in the canon of American literature has been somewhat eclipsed by other more post-modernist trends. While I firmly believe that the Western canon is in dire need of expansion to include `third world', woman and minority voices Fitzgerald's literary merits stand on their own. His tightly- crafted story line, his sense of language and the flat-out fact that that he knew the subject matter that formed the basis of his expositions merit renewed consideration by today's reader. Simply put, if you want to understand part of what was going on in America in the 1920's before the Great Crash of 1929 then you simply have to read the man. If nothing else read the last few pages of Gatsby. If there is a better literary expression of the promise of America as seem by the early Dutch settlers of New York  as the last best hope of civilization and the failure of that promise at the hands of the `robber barons' and their descendents I have not read it.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002MTU|4.0|This is what Eric Clapton has always done best - play the blues. On this album all the tracks (16 of them) are blues in all its various forms.<br /><br />Reading the inside of the sleeve made for refreshing reading as it says \\"THIS IS A LIVE RECORDING WITH NO OVERDUBS OR EDITS EXCEPT FOR DOBRO OVERDUB ON HOW LONG BLUES AND DRUM OVERDUB ON MOTHERLESS CHILDREN\\". What a change from his mid to late 80's albums that were vastly over-produced. Great credit to EC for realising that he needed to get away from being a purely commercial artist. If you are being critical you might have thought he could have found something more original to play than another cover of \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\". However I enjoyed it regardless.<br /><br />The band are some of Clapton's regular guys, Chris Stainton on Keyboards, Andy Fairweather Low Guitar, Jim Keltner drums plus a horn section. Again if you were being critical you'd ask why not some 'real' blues players backing him. However these guys are all professional musicians who deliver nothing less than professional performances and I'm not sure that anybody else could have done any better.<br /><br />The Robert Johnson sessions are probably better than this album, but you have to put this album in context. It was only a few years earlier that EC had released 'August', where his best songs had been removed by the record company and in many ways he had lost artistic control of his own record. In comparison to that 'work' this album IS a return to his roots that he since never really looked back from.
0793518326|5.0|This book is an overwhelming piece of work: every single Beatles song (not counting the Anthology material), carefully transcribed -- not arranged, but transcribed: every note played by every instrument, as nearly as notation can represent such a thing. <br /> <br />The transcriptions are generally quite accurate. There are some mistakes in the lyrics. Flaws in the notes, however, are very few and far between -- impressive, considering the sheer quantity of music in this book! <br /> <br />The notation is exceptionally thoughtful, and sensitive to the music. There are many situations where rock music is poorly served by notation, such as extended guitar technique, or rhythmically ambiguous improvisation. Most transcriptions fall flat in these places, but these scores manage to convey the music just about as well as notation could hope to. Like The Beatles, the transcribers who produced this book are masters of their craft. <br /> <br />The music is written out in full score (i.e. all the instruments together). This is a big plus for me, because it means that it's possible to see the interaction of all the instruments as a whole. However, if you are performing the music, you may need to extract individual parts. <br /> <br />This is definitely a study score, not a performance score. The print is clear and clean, but small. The book is too thick to sit on most music stands. The pages don't stay flat without help. The page turns are numerous. Performers looking to use the scores will want to make enlarged photocopies of the pages, or copy off parts. (And yes, that is legal as long as it is for personal use.) <br /> <br />The book does not list the precise instruments (was that a Fender or a Gibson?) or who played them. For that information, I highly recommend William J. Dowdling's [[ASIN:0671682296 Beatlesongs]]. It makes an excellent complement to these scores. <br /> <br />I have only three major complaints: <br /> <br />(1) The songs are arranged alphabetically, notin album order. If you want to follow through Abbey Road (and you do!), you're going to be doing a heck of a lot of page turning. <br /> <br />(2) On top of that, the name of the current song is not printed in the margin of the page, meaning that it can be quite difficult to locate a specific song in the book. I have 40 or 50 sticky notes coming out the side of my book, so that I can locate songs quickly. <br /> <br />(3) The four people who performed this monumental task get almost no credit. They are not listed as authors; their names are not on the cover, or the spine, or the back. No, they are listed in teeny tiny type tucked underneath the copyright notice on p.4. Their names are Tetsuya Fujita, Yuji Hagino, Hajime Kubo, and Goro Sato (a fab four of transcription!), and they deserve to have their names in giant letters and bright lights for what they have done. My 5-star rating goes to them, and not to Hal Leonard for pushing them into near-anonymity. <br /> <br />This is a fabulous book, both a staggering achievement and a wealth of information. I wish somebody would produce something half this good for the other non-notated musicians I love. (Hey there TF, YH, HK, and GS: want to tackle Yes, 1970-77? I'd buy it in a heartbeat!)
B000GRTQXY|5.0|I've been waiting for Primal Scream to make an album like Riot City Blues and they finally did it.  They tried couple of times before with their second self-titled cd and Give Out But Don't Give Up cd but couldn't pull it off with consistency.  I wish Riot City Blues was a double album though because the songs are so good.  I think every song on this cd is great.  It's just a fun cd to listen to and these guys can really play their instruments.  This album is a mixture of the Rolling Stones, David Bowie, Country music, Glam rock, pyschedelic, etc. Unfortunantely, Primal Scream is so good at making futuristic, electronic, intense garage-rock that most fans love(including me) that they might not like this style of music; but they just need to accept these songs for what they are because they are amazing.  I hope the boys continue in making this style of music but knowing them, they're going to go back to making  XTRMNTR and Evil Heat type of songs to please their fans.  I urge Primal Scream to continue on making all kinds of music for music sake, not to sell cds but the music business is all about money so we will have to wait and see.  No matter what though, Primal Scream will always be one of my favorite bands and it's too bad they are not popular in the U.S. because they are truly amazing and I just love their rebel image.
B000O178BY|2.0|I was not impressed at all by this album.  The songs sounded too much the same.  No stand out songs that I would really care to hear again.  Im not a HUGE fan, but if I was I could still be objective.  The songs are heavy on sound effects, beeps, scratches, etc.. and way too lite on creativity and melody.  Most people like NIN because they are able to make industrial music more than just industrial music.  They give it dynamics that others can't.  They have always taken it to the next level.  To me, this album sounds like it could have been made by anybody.  Nothing was memorable.

B00006IX0R|4.0|I will admit the title \\"Best\\" is deceptive, but the record company did many of us a favor who own the Cranberries albums. This compilation offers the single versions and created new edits, which is clearly stated in the booklet.  Imagine trying to buy all eighteen songs (pictured in the booklet) individually? The last two songs on this CD, making the total twenty were previously unreleased.  The Pop-Rockin'  \\"Stars\\" is no token throw-away.  It one of their better songs in the last phase of the Cranberries.  I like the single versions better on this CD and album versions better on the individual albums if that makes sense.  A true \\"Best\\" is owning \\"Everybody Else Is Doing It So Why Can't We?  - Complete\\",  \\"No Need To Argue - Complete\\" and this compilation.  The other indivdual songs is personal choice. The band also had the fans vote for their favourite non-single - \\"Daffodil Lament\\". So what is offered here is sampler of their five albums.  For a beginner, it's good enough.  For a big fan, it closes the book unless the band gets back together. In the 1990's the Dave Matthews Band and the Cranberries were Modern Rock's best.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Totally unexpected... but the best movie I've seen in years.  I'm not one to get overly emotional but I was cheering out loud and living each moment with almost all of the characters.  Excellent production with a GREAT set of actors and actresses!
B000MNP2KI|1.0|This movie was pointless and boring, and I consider myself a Bond fanatic.  Daniel Craig's acting is completely one-dimensional, has none of the clever wit of any of the other Bonds.  The decision to go to the \\"origin\\" of Bond gaining 007 status, while sounding like a good plot point, just falls flat.  No gadets! Wait, I take that back... a freakin' defibulator!?!  C'mon... And just when I thought I'd see that awesome new Aston Martin in action, this dill-weed crashes it in like 3 seconds! This film is a disgrace to the franchise.  The producers should just bring back George Lazenby before they use this guy again...
0060589280|5.0|I find it surprising that so many reviewers find this \\"unrealistic\\" and too \\"intellectual\\" for discussion of desire. This is not a nonfiction research text on prostitution, a sexuality manual, or a work of realistic fiction. In fact, it is just the opposite of all of those things. It is a simple parable wrought with symbolism, which makes a complex universal point. The story is engaging, philosophical, light, and familiar despite making an important and essentially human observation about the timelessness of love and sex. It is this wisdom and timelessness that captures the hearts of Coelho readers time and time again.

B000O178BY|5.0|The new Nine Inch Nails is an electronic mayhem layered beat pounding machine of catchy dance anthem one after the next! The previous album With Teeth felt more like a rock album, with a very \\"live\\" sounding feel to it. Almost every track on Year Zero comes equipped with a pulse pounding beat for all you electro and industrial fans. NIN hasn't had such an immense electronic sound since The Downward Spiral. I'm a huge fan of electronic music, so I find this album to be the best from NIN in a very long time.

B000O178BY|5.0|Trent Reznor has never really been a bundle of sunshine, but he reaches a new level of darkness in Nine Inch Nails' \\"Year Zero.\\"<br /><br />It's a pessimistic view of what the world might be in 2022, if all of society were to decay (which doesn't really happen, but still...). And he unleashes this nihilism in a sweeping, razor-edged concept album, full of pointed lyrics and ominous electro-rock.<br /><br />It opens with the rapid drums of \\"Hyperpower,\\" an intro that weaves in some fuzzy bass and spasmodic electronica. It segues into a tight, spare hard-rocker with squiggling synth, with Reznor being drowned out as he sings, \\"Down on your knees/You'll be left behind/This is the beginning/Watch what you think/They can read your mind...\\"<br /><br />The songs that follow are suitably bleak hard-rockers laced with synth -- the undulating creepy \\"Survivalism,\\" slow-burning hard-rock ballads, explosive muscular rockers, razor-edged electrorock, and the rapid smash'n'rapping of \\"Capital G,\\" which is unsurprisingly about a certain president.<br /><br />\\"Year Zero\\" is a tight coil of nihilistic rock, unwinding to show off its dark message as the songs go on. While society has never utterly crumbled all at once, this album sounds like the soundtrack to the ultimate apocalypse movie, with hints of oppression and corruption from all sides.<br /><br />His music is basically a combination of hammering bass and drums and a tight muscular guitar. There's also that classic electronic edge -- jabs of steely synth sometimes, squealing screeches at others, and frenetic squidges at others. It's all twisted together into ominous, unstoppable melodies.<br /><br />And Reznor howls out haunting songs, which are full of misery, numbness, some rather excessive jabs at religion, jagged political barbs, laments, and sometimes gleeful anger (\\"Come on down, my friend/It's time to meet your MASTER!\\"). The rapping sound was a bad idea, though -- it sounds too forthright for the rest of the album.<br /><br />But there seems to be a faint glimmer of hope in the final song, where he intones \\"May God have mercy on our dirty little hearts,\\" and relates, \\"And I guess I just wanted to tell you, as the lights start to fade,/That you are the reason that I am not afraid... as the heavens will fall,/We will be together soon if we will be anything at all.\\" It ends with windy synth and a delicate piano outro.<br /><br />Darkness and pessimism rule \\"Year Zero,\\" a blistering and tightly written ode to a bleak worst-case-scenario future.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|There has been a hype over global warming for a long time now.  Or is it just a hype?  I dislike taking sides - liberal, conservative and so on, it is much better to stay in the middle, as it's the only way to get a full view of both left and right.<br /><br />Al Gore is not one of the most entertaining people in the world.  We can all agree on that.  So I was worried that it would take me several days of fighting sleep to see this documentary.  I am very happy that I was wrong.  Al Gore's presentation throughout the documentary was precise, well-delivered, non-argumentative, non-confrontational, not to mention educational, informative and downright interesting.<br /><br />Political sides aside, viewing this film about global warming with an open mind, one can not help but have their interest piqued.  All who blindly discount theories and presentations are not really open minded, hence their opinions are of little importance.  Little knowledge is a dangerous thing, it has been said, and Mr. Gore offered us a lot more knowledge in a concise format than we previously had.  None of the information that Mr. Gore presented is elusive - to the contrary, it is easily verified.  Naturally, in our research we would be better suited to consider scientific sources, as opposed to amateur ones.<br /><br />A fantastic, very informative film, \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" is a must see for anyone who wants to be informed.  Look at the pictures, if nothing else, they really do say a thousand words each, and Mr. Gore presents the photographs very well indeed.  Hype?  Do we dare take a chance?  I wouldn't.  Enjoy the film.
0671042858|5.0|I've read \\"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon\\" at least a half-a-dozen times and it never gets old.  The story is both believable and compelling and well worth your time.
B000O178BY|3.0|This is the first NIN album I have heard, so I cannot put it in context with what has come before from this artist. Other newcomers to NIN will want to listen to this before purchase, advisable for almost every new album, but especially here. My musical and lyrical context is great pop music (XTC, Beatles) and progressive rock like Canada's power trio Rush -- that is the standard I am using for comparison.     The music is mechanical and fairly monotonous with beats, bleeps, bloops, other electro-mechanical sounds, distorted guitars, distorted voices. A few of the songs have interesting melodies, Great Destroyer for example, though this is marred by a descent into mostly rhythmic noise.      If this is an attempt at some artistic statement against the politics and religion of America, I would judge it rather pedestrian. As a Christian, I thought I might be offended, but Reznor never draws much blood as far as I'm concerned. He doesn't really compete with the visceral attack of an Andy Partridge (\\"Dear God... Did you make disease, and the diamond blue? Did you make mankind after we made you? And the devil too!\\"), or the straightforward anti-religion of Neil Peart's Fear (Witch Hunt being the most famous of the four parts of that work).     As a new listener, I have very little feeling about this. It isn't particularly good, it isn't particularly poor. Musically it is a little monotonous, but it isn't unlistenable. Lyrically it seems pale, and Reznor's delivery is often rather low-key spoken or whispered. If this moves anyone, I'm at a loss to know why. If Reznor worries about a religious [...] world empire, he should probably focus his attention more keenly on Islamism. In an Islamist state, he might not be able to make or hear music of any sort, or express any disquiet or dissent about the leadership. No alcohol, no free love either. Is it Trent's purpose to cast doubt on the only world empire ready to defend him from real fascism so that he can be free to whine about oppression? I'd say from Reznor's or anybody's point of view, that's a bad strategy.
B000002O1Q|4.0|This soundtrack is the only place you can find \\"Tonight Is What It Means to Be Young,\\"a cut that Jim Steinman aficionados rank among the man's best. Steinman songs can be taken as face-value celebrations of hormonal teenage glory, or , if you find the touches of humor sprinkled throughout, taken as well-aimed parodies of rock 'n' roll's grander impulses. When \\"Tonight\\"  achieves liftoff, though, it's hard to be a doubter. When Steinman's hallelujah chorus starts chanting, \\"Before you know it, it's gone,\\" you're slapping your pants pocket, searching for the keys to your old Kawasaki. Great stuff. However, a rock philosopher once said that the farther the music gets away from Chuck Berry, the thinner the pleasures become. To rescue you from that fate, the Blasters and Ry Cooder contribute terrific songs, as well as a pre-Lone Justice Maria McKee. Get a hold of this before it goes out of print. <br />
