B00DAPOHUQ|5.0|Fantastic Jack!  If you're a Jack Johnson fan then this is well worth your ear.  I can't get enough of it!!!  Jack is Back!!!
B0017XD3OY|5.0|This is a fantastic movie.  One of the best Will Smith has done.<br />Great quality.  Glad I rented it and would even consider buying it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I understand why this was a great hit at the movies now. Well written and always exciting. Read it straight through on a long flight. Could not put it down!
0316055433|3.0|The book went into tedious detail and was boring  skimmed the last third of the book ,<br /><br />Was not worth the read,
B001ILFUDC|3.0|The one disc was loose and rolling around inside the case the holder was crushed resulting in the disc to be scratched.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|everything seems to work fine. I just have to get used to doing all this on such a small keyboard.
0385720920|5.0|Loved this book. Unfortunately, after I read it, I saw the movie. I would give anything to get that time back.
1452651485|5.0|Product was received on time, very well wrapped, in excellent conditions and arrived promptly, before the expected date.<br />Its content is very informative, with simple but very well defined meaning. I hardly could put it away. I do believe that The Gerson Therapy is THE way to cure many degenerative deceases. Everyone searching for answers with any questionable medical illness should give this book a try, it will alleviate the uncertainty and bring hope to the cure.<br />I have recommended this product to people that has expressed anguish on their health-situation.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|i just rate it as a one star because google is not making it easy for us to use this great (in theory) gadget, this should be amazing but it is not basically if you have a smart tv with youtube in it you dont need this.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I love this game so much. it really is too addicting! I hope they come out with more games like this
B00DJ4PIBK|1.0|We have been getting the star wars advent calendar for my son for several years. We were really excited to see something different for our daughter. I was so excited until yesterday when she opened door #1 and we saw the mini figure. The mini figures in this set are skinny with breasts. We collect mini figures and it NEVER occurred to us that these would not be the same blocky figures that we have enjoyed since my husband and myself where kids. This kind of gentrification is very upsetting to me. I do not want my 5 year old wondering why her legos look different than her brothers. I do not want her concerned about body shape this early in her life.<br /><br />I do not mind the color change. We get pink, purple and pastel colored pieces from lego outlet stores all the time to supplement our lego collection for different looks to builds.
B000NU2CY4|5.0|An excellent movie, an instant classic worthy of the finest blu ray release.  It was amazing how the Colosseum was totally recreated and brought back to life.  This was a case when CGI was truly used to fullest effect.  The music was excellent, although the battle sequence music  both in and outside the arena was derived from the \\"Mars\\" section of Holst's \\"The Planets.\\"  But what an inspiration !  You cannot improve upon perfection, and the musical derivation was a wonderful variation nonetheless.
B0059R5Q08|5.0|This is a great movie, I can somewhat relate to it. I find it sad and beautiful, would watch it again!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A well written book well thought out and delivered in format for a large group of the reading public. Well done .......<br />...
B00AC8ZJ6K|4.0|I enjoyed the movie. Pretty good action packed scifi. Didn't care for the ending. One of those that leaves you hanging for a follow up movie.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|Awesome album! Deftones doesn't disappoint! The sound always evolves and the Deftones don't let you down!<br />AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Kind of fun. Have not played much but seems fun so far. Not to bad of graphics. Nothing too special good
B004YJMQCS|5.0|If you want to give your 3-D TV a good workout, this is the movie to do it!  Not the greatest plot in the world, but it was designed to take full advantage of a TV's 3D capability.  I watch it at least once every few months.  Remember though, you have to have a 3D capable BluRay DVD player to watch it.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|It has been a long time since I played FreeCell on my PC. Thanks for the tutorial. Works great. I like the auto play.
B001HIJYR4|5.0|I loved the movie and had to get this DVD.  Never regretted it!  Have watched it several times now.  Also love the music.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|When I wasn't actually reading this book, I was thinking about it or raving on about my obsession with it to anyone who would listen. It took the brilliant Brandon Sanderson ten years to write and I burned through it in three days. My apologies, Mr. S.<br />The Way of Kings is a work of art, and it had me laughing and sobbing and just staring at the wall in sheer awe. The characters are total studs, the story is absolutely and utterly gripping, and the way the plot was presented gave me chills. Stormfather, but this book is beautiful.<br />So it's probably obvious that I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone who values literature that has been saturated in genius. You will not be disappointed, of that I assure you.
B004UXUUDA|5.0|This is a WW II movie that will break your heart.  The characters are strongly drawn and Kristin Scott Thomas is an absolutely<br />amazing talent.
B000SEKNUK|2.0|The overall premise of the book makes sense.  The approaches seem way off base.  Also, the organization of the book is not helpful.
B000N6UERK|5.0|It is a good movie. I love temporal movies. Denzel was good as always. It's a good story line also.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|LOVED this series.  I would highly recommend it.  I could not put it down.  The story is expertly crafted and will keep you reading.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This true story is one of those from WW II that is just unbelievable.  You will not be able to reach the end without being strongly moved emotionally.
B008JDAC7G|5.0|Fun fun fun! I have had this game for nearly a year.  Its still as fun to play now as the first day I downloaded it on a whim.<br /><br />If you like Jenga you will enjoy Monsters.  The aim of the game is simple remove coloured condos from stack to feed the matching monster without collapsing the stack. Feeding the monsters the incorrect colour will make them angry quicker.  Certain combinations give you power-ups; bigger combos give you bigger power-ups.  Each monster has a special ability which can help you in the game:  Red puts everyone to sleep when they become too angry; green doubles your bonuses; blue makes a shield to keep everything from falling; and yellow gets you more condos.<br /><br />The farther you get in the game the quicker the monsters get angry and try to knock down the stack.<br /><br />A fun fast game I still enjoy playing even after a year.  Give it a try.  Nothing to lose since its the faotd today.  You won't be disppointed.
B00000DFTG|4.0|I have a hard time listening to live albums in general.  I would say this album is better than Live at Last or Live Evil with Dio.  One of the downfalls is that Ozzy didn't sing the final lyrics at the end of Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and this was probably due to the high notes.  I also thought the studio tracks were weak.  They could of done live versions of Killing Yourself to Live and Symptom of the Universe and made this a complete live album, but don't get me wrong this probably the best Sabbath/Ozzy live album.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The questions raised were thought provoking and the characters portrayed were real.  I could not put it down.  I have already recommened it to friends.
B002XXUWMI|4.0|Great sci-fi story line with good solid twists. I loved the cinematography - dark and foreboding for a reason. My son noted that JJ Abrams ripped off part of his &#34;Fringe&#34; back story from Dark City.
B003V4AK8E|2.0|Not crazy about the grip on this item.  It tends to rub sore spots on your hands/fingers. Other than that it works as expected.
B000001EUN|4.0|This may not be as good as Lovedrive or Breakout but it has great tracks like The Zoo, Make it Real and the title track.  An essential to any Scorpions collection.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Did I really buy this app or did it just come as part of the phenom bloatware package on my new smartphone?  Pretty sure it is the latter.  I'm trying to figure out why I get asked to rate apps in so many places.  I mean the app store or play store are where everyone goes to see app ratings, right?  So this is just a Kindle app that works like a Kindle, except it's not a Kindle, so don't be confused, it's an app.  Wait... you don't understand?  No, your Samsung Ecstasy Moan 7 smartphone isn't a Kindle, but you can get the app for it, which is what you are looking at when you read Kindle books on that phone.  Amazing!
B00F35BV64|2.0|If you've ever seen another sci-fi movie, and I mean ANY OTHER sci-fi movie then you can skip this one. If you've ever seen any Star Trek episode or movie than you could've written this one. It's all there from plot to dialogue to action sequences. I know the characters all have to follow form and not stray from their established identities. I get that. Still, did Bones really have to say &#34;Damn it Jim I'm a doctor not a torpedo technician&#34;? Trite and inane. Simon Pegg was the only reason this movie was bearable - the fact that he could talk to Kirk in real time via interstellar space with merely a walkie-talkie not withstanding...and it sure is convenient that the Klingons make no effort to guard their homeworld...At least the villain was different and original...oh, wait...never mind. This movie represents Hollywood in it's purest form. We keep buying this drak so I guess we deserve it.<br />  I still have to give it 2 stars because it isn't important enough to bother with hating. The Star Wars franchise has been handed over to this team! ...Sherman surely was referring to this fact when he stated &#34;I almost tremble at her fate&#34;. Indeed.
B00GIY5OGC|2.0|It was mildly entertaining to our 4, 6, and 8 year-olds. But it lacked the character development found in its &#34;Cars&#34; predecessor.
B002W24COO|5.0|Nirvana was the band that started the 90's with Nevermind.  This was a great follow up to that album.  It had several good songs.
B00170GXQ2|1.0|I recently read the book and looked on-line to see which Dracula version was closest to the book; this version was recommended.  While this appeared close to the book, Coppola had to screw it up with tawdry sex (fine in the succubus lair with Harkin, not fine with Lucy), and a complete story rewrite on the Mina-Dracul relationship and her feelings toward him and Jonathan.  Stupid script and, well, Keanu Reeves is in it, so there's that also.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Thought provoking story well told. Interesting characters-more so than the TV series, very loosely based on the book. Describes a journey of developing self insight. I found it hard to put down.
B000BNI99K|5.0|I am getting this for my mother for Christmas.  She has been dropping serious hints for the last two years.  I got this during the Black Christmas deals and it was worth the money.  The bonus?  You get a zipped file of the songbook.  Two presents in one!
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Really cute and funny. Very safe for kids and I would recommend for any family...all of us have been laughing and enjoying Shaun and his buds.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldnt put it down.  Ordered the 2nd and third book in the series and had them all read within a couple weeks.  Great story and characterization.
B00129H7VS|5.0|This is a must have for not only those that enjoy military movies, but anyone who needs a reminder of what sacrifices were made to give us the freedoms we have today.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book is a milk different things. I love (almost) everything but the ending. The epilogue and the two chapters before it don't really satisfy my needs. Like, what happened to Gale? What are the names of the children of Annie/Finnick and Peeta/Katniss? What were the fates of Johanna, Haymitch, Gale's family, the rest of the victors, Greasy Sae (I think is how to spell her name?), Beetee, Katniss's mother, and the other surviving victors? And, did Buttercup have a place in Katniss's future?<br />The book had an odd emotional part to though. I couldn't help but cry, over and over, and over again. Finnick, Prim, Cinna, and Peeta's family's death are all real slaps in the face. The book has so many plot twists, you will definitely NEVER know what's gonna happen. There's always a little bit of predicament, from knowing the characters so well, but this just explodes so much, you'll never put the book down.<br />The book touches your heart, too. From Gale, to Peeta, to Finnick, to Prim, to Katniss, to Cinna, to even Buttercup. You'll notice holding your breath, tears leaving your eyes, to just wanting to HELP.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|I have my own kindle but I didn't hAve money for it so I got it on my mom's kindle it is a lot of fun.I litterlitarly won't stop playing it .I will only play this game and tiny castle cause I need to check on it anyway I can go to worlds and save it on my best wold this game is better way than minecraft love love it
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was my favorite of the 3-part series.  I just couldn't put the book down.  What was really nice, is that I have trouble sleeping at night and so I down loaded it onto my ipad with a kindle application.
B00GLX1MG6|4.0|Funny, a little dark in places.  Jennifer Aniston can pole dance!  She always had such a good girl image I thought.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|didn't read much thought it was very nasty filthy book!!  WE really need to have some good family stores not smut
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This is his movie. The books are way better(as they always are) there is an EXTREME amount of hard core language,blood,<br />violence, and flat out sex. The story line is grand  I would rather read the books. KIds can't walk in on that and .....
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I've never read a novel by Stephen King before. Mostly because I was never interested in books about horror. This is not a book about horror. The only scary thing in this book, for me, was the consequences of decisions and behavior. From where I'm sitting, this is one outstanding book.<br /><br />It all starts in the diner of Al Templeton, somewhere in Maine. He convinces his regular customer, Jake, a high school English teacher on summer break, that he needs to go back in time to stop the assassination of President Kennedy. Al has found a way and shows him how. Jake goes back to 1958 to do just that.<br /><br />Yep, 1958, 5 years before the assassination. I'm sure regular Stephen King readers know what that means, a lot of exciting events are detailed in the meantime.<br /><br />There is a lot of history in this story, and it was all well researched. On top of that, you get an amazing, original story from the mind of a man that seems to ooze amazing, original stories. This one is a time travel story. The possibilities, the details, the dialogue, everything are so genuine that you believe that all of this, on top of the assassination, really did happen. There are a lot of details spelled out here, but it's written so well that you'll never find yourself flipping pages back to figure out who's who or when this or that happened. It's that well organized. I was surprised I read the entire thing as quickly as I did (it's 880 pages long) without wanting anything else or asking any questions about any person, place or thing in the story. It's complete, it's detailed, it's original, it's smart (very smart) and most of all it's a pure escape into another way of thinking. The moral of this story for me was 'behavior has consequences', each decision we make affects someone or something else. It made me think, and I can't ask for anything else in my reading life.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|I love this movie! You know you can't go wrong with a kids movie starring Danny Devito and Rhea Perlman. It is absolutely hysterical. And it often leaves you with your mouth hanging wide open. I don't even have kids and I own this bc kids will watch it over and over and I don't mind it either.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I absolutely enjoyed this book!  Stephen king books are always great but this one was so good that when I got near the end I slowed down reading it because I didn't want it to be over.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is very very very good awesome i love it<br />because I don't have words to say only i really loved
B003G4W49C|3.0|I enjoyed this book until the end,when the author seemed to just zip it all up suddenly.  Was he trying to make the book into something spiritual?  I just couldn't swallow the ending.  Perhaps the author's intent is revealed in the next few books, but the sudden way in which he summed up the first book didn't leave me with the desire to read more.  Perhaps his intent was to tease my mind to want to know more, but for me, the ending just felt like I had wasted my time.
B001V5CIFI|5.0|This is one of my favorite all time children's movies! Kids love to watch it over and over. You cannot go wrong with it.
B00G4I11YQ|4.0|Wasn't too bad. Exactly what I expected. Very sad to see what happens behind the scenes....I feel bad for the whales!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Cut the Rope is a good game and one of my favorites for kindle fire. It runs well and fast with no bugs. I like the fact that each &quot;box&quot; or &quot;stage&quot; gets harder as you progress in skill while completing the levels. This app is worth every penny you'll spend on it. Would recommend to someone who wants a game that not so easy you are done in five minutes,  but challengingvand engaging enough  and not frustrating so you want to plsy more later. Some of the levels can be difficult and even frustrating,  but most can be figured out through trial and error to find the &quot;trick&quot; to completing the level and getting 3 stars (a perfect score in this game). The only issue I have with the game itself is that if you qre stuck on a level you can use superpowers to complete it snd eafn extra stars. This costs money,  and I think it should be free with limited uses. Not enough to take off a star,  though. Overall this game rocks!
B00275EGX8|5.0|extremely well done - 5 star action throughout - maybe that's why it took &#34;Best Picture&#34; and if I remember correctly: it beat-out Avatar that year
0316322407|5.0|Malala's story is the story of many young women in Pakistan, with the exception of course of her targeting by the Taliban. This young woman is an inspiration to us all, and she presents her story here in the same manner she has presented it elsewhere - calm, cool, collected and unwavering from her principles. Her writing (ably aided by Christina Lamb) is both colorful and effective - as she tells of her upbringing in the Swat Valley, you feel transported there. The noose-like invasion of the Taliban into her home territory is painted in words that are chilling.<br /><br />It is amazing how a young woman can have such strength, and while I recommend this book for everyone, I especially recommend it for teenage girls. Each of us can learn a lot from Malala's story of courage and poise in the face of life-threatening adversity. Long may Malala live.
B009ZE27US|1.0|this does not tell your age im 14 but it tells me im 32 this is such a weird app i dont like it. well it would be cool if you did it the frist time and it got your age that would be cool but over all i DONT LIKE IT SO DONT GET THE APPPP
B000FCKIFU|5.0|ANOTHER GREAT BALDACCI BOOK.  It's good to read the start of the Camel Club.  I read the series several books in and was glad to read the origin of the Camel Club.  These are great reads for traveling or kicking back in those rare quiet moments you can steal at home.
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|This is just my Personal Opinion but I was somewhat Let Down on this season - the prior 3 seemed better
B00GTZJLAK|3.0|it was a little to childish compared to cars...wasn't expecting that. Will not be renting planes 2...no sir ree folks!
B00FXEL00W|5.0|Extremely well written with clever details. I really enjoyed everything about this book! I can't wait for another from Kristin Zimmer
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am absolutely addicted to this game. there are some glitches but overall it is wondrous. also needs more locations
1250038820|5.0|You don't have to be an art lover to appreciate/enjoy this book.  This is an amazing collection of photographs that will touch you in every way.  This collection shows how different and unique we are as a people yet still the same.  Everyone lives, laughs, hurts, cries and loves.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I loved Divergent fromthe begining and Insurgent wasnt too bad either. unfortunately though i HATED allegiant, i mostly disliked the ending with Tris dying, i feltblikebit was a easy way to end the story and the relaitionship between Four and Tris wasa huge part of the story that just got cut out. I MISS TRIS :(
0385349947|4.0|Sound advice. Name dropping is fine but there's way, way too much in this book. It just goes on and on.
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|This movie is a fun film.  It was really good!  If you don't laugh, you must be dead.  I gave it a five for clever content, great acting, and its fast moving humor.  Enjoy the film!
B006RZZ7HS|3.0|This is one of those movies where the sequel is better than the original, but it is necessary to watch the original to fully understand what's going on.
B00FOU1O3S|4.0|Great graphics in this game.the young and old like yo play it in my house. The bear is so cute and entertaining.
B00005JNJV|5.0|This movie one of the Best Batman movies I have ever seen and also it was a start of a trilogy that left fans happy and wanting more!
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Mockingjay is written for angsty teenagers to flip through on the school bus. The characters are 1-dimensional, the dialogue is a joke, and the action is more boring than Catching Fire, which was bad enough. I don't understand the popularity of this derivative series but I really don't understand how the same author who was capable of writing a decent first novel somehow crapped out this mess.<br /><br />Katniss is basically a psychopath throughout the book and in the end she just shoots the leader of the revolutionaries when she could've killed the President of the Capitol. Strangely, there are no consequences for this action and they let her go live happily ever after with the baker boy. I just can't think of anything else to say about this book other than it left me feeling completely empty and apathetic. I was just glad it was over. Don't read this book, it's horrible. Read the summary on wikipedia or something, it'll waste a lot less of your time.
B009NX1YT6|3.0|Good music and singing  from the 70's - but only fair acting. Actors in this are not looking so good now.
0071390111|5.0|If you want to but the bible of neuroscience, this is it. This book provides the best bird's eye view of all the major issues, and it affords a great deal of detail as well. It is one of the best uses of a hundred dollars possible, if your goal is to understand how the brain works.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I was not sure that I would like this, but after the first episode I was hooked!  I had to buy the rest of the season and watch all the episodes at one time.  Great surprise ending!  I have heard that David Tennant is both to star in a second season on British TV and to star in an American remake of this first season - seems strange, but I will keep a lookout for either or both.
B00GH4R95C|2.0|Once again we have another reboot of the story of Superman and to tell you the truth, it misses by a mile. What happened here was they tried to skip the whole beginning and jump into movie two of the series with General Zod. Sadly, by the end of the movie, no one knows who Superman is. Seriously! The only thing the public knows is two super guys with powers (aliens) have destroyed half of metropolis and surely killed tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people and at the end of the movie I'm supposed to believe that they will now accept the &#34;good&#34; superhero? Huh?<br /><br />Who was the genius who thought this up? The story has many flashbacks that try to explain the backstory but they do little justice to the original premise of the series. The fighting scenes are repetitious and are just a collection of me throwing you into a building and you throwing me into a building over and over again breaking stuff. This is the part of the movie where lots of people die but we never see the bodies. Hard to imagine all that building breaking without people being in the way and ending up squashed.<br /><br />Since the story of superman has been done over and over again I don't think I'm spoiling anything by saying that at the end of this movie, the real first movie begins. Clark Kent appears looking for work. Talk about a PR nightmare. There is no way in hell Superman will be able to rehabilitate his image now. Trust me, I'm the good guy. LOL!!!!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I chose four stars because this book is a fictional story geared toward young adults.  I enjoyed it very much, but it is not a classic novel.  With that being said, this book is very engaging for the reader.  It is hard to put down, and leaves you wanting more.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Yuck. Why did I download this? because I wanted to see if it was faster or different from visiting youtube.com via web browser on my kindle and boy I regret downloading this lol
B0063GORYU|5.0|I play this everyday.  .it's my evening game, not many I don't win, but can spend hours playing and keeps me alert
6304936362|5.0|You either love this movie or hate it. There is little character development which bothered me until it was explained that the characters were kids. There wasn't a lot to develop. DVD is very good with good sound. Would recommend this for anyones library.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This does not hold a candle to The Shining and I think King says something to that effect in the author's notes at the end. This is however a good book and it blows the books he has written the last couple of years out of the water. I am so glad that we finally get to find out what happened to Danny. True to King fashion there are some pretty disturbing things that happen in this book (involving little kids sadly enough) but what else do you expect from this man? He puts everything right in your face like he has always done.<br /><br />I am not going to give out spoilers here but if you are King fan read it, if you loved the Shining read it, if you are searching for a good book and you have a pretty strong stomach (remember this is FICTION) read it.
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|I chose this rating to get rid of this review thing from my to do section. So i give this 3 stars
B008JFUR10|5.0|if you grew up watching anime like I did, this movie is that movie japan never made in live action.<br />cheesy? sure, but its a giant robot punching a giant monster in the face, what do you expect?<br />its basically gundam vs godzilla, and if you are into that, this movie is the best live action anime ever made
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|He's a master at trolling y so many cliffhangers uncle Rick  be nice to my Percy Jason Frank HAZEL and all the other characters don't let them die<br /><br />  Love,annabeth chase <3
B001NKI60W|5.0|I saw this when it came out in the theaters; I rented it on Amazon and I purchased the DVD. I loved this movie, the music, everything.. and Meryl Streep was excellent!
B00F2362IE|3.0|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles daaaa daaa guitar solor......TURTLE POWER! I wish I could see the original TMNT movies back in theaters again from the early 90's because this movie was magical. Oh yeah this game? i got it for free
B0064MPXFA|4.0|An excellent series...it really keeps/holds your interest.  All actors are good but the role of the investigator for the law firm is especially intriguing.  Looking forward to watching the rest of the seasons.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun,exciting and interactive. Subway Surfers adds excitment to my life... I love this game. So try it for yourself..
B00F91RYL8|1.0|I love Zombies. I was so excited that I could rent this and not have to sit in a packed theater. Was I ever disappointed. 40 minutes into the movie, I turned it off. It was b-o-r-i-n-g and not at all what I expected. The only plus was that while $3.99 seemed too much but at least I didn't spend $15.00 on a movie ticket...
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|I got this game because it was free! Who says no to free? Not me! Wheeee!!!! Oh yeah, slender man is scary
B002PZ6XB8|4.0|Very nice story about the child writer/illustrator.  The story starts slowly but grows on you.  Really worth watching.  Animations of the drawings are an added highlight.
B003WWZ1R0|4.0|This is an excellent CD for yoga or just relaxing. Good blend of artists and sounds to help hold those poses or just get your zen on.
B00C2GJWNG|5.0|This is a really great debut album for British singer/songwriter, Jake Bugg. Obviously his inspirations are the musical stylings of a time gone by, but he brings a fresh sound and approach with personal and honest songs that are packed full of talent and no pretense. I see a very bright future ahead for this incredibly talented rising star.

B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love the &#34;Today&#34; verse feature each day, and also all the many choices in versions.  Just wish we could download the NASB for offline use--it's one of the few you can't, and that's what the church uses where we're visiting...  I've also enjoyed most of the daily plans I've used.
B00004XQ83|5.0|It's a fun movie and the music defines it.  great music, great sound.  If you like bluegrass and gospel, this soundtrack is for you.
B00GI13VYW|5.0|Jake Bugg is an amazing young singer/songwriter. So far I have not heard one song from him that I didn't like. This is a great follow up to his debut album that was released just earlier this year. I am really looking forward to a lot more great music from Jake Bugg. I highly recommend this album.
B0029ELDG0|5.0|I read this years ago and ran across this and am glad I did. Much better then the movie with Bruce Willis and ???
B00G4EXNNM|3.0|I thought it was a different Everly Brothers, I didn't know about this one and was disappointed that this was not the popular songs.  I think the music is great, if that that was what you were expecting.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|The first two in the series had me spellbound, and I couldn't sleep without finishing them.  It took me a while to finish Allegiant. It was a good story, but lacked the suspense of the first two.
B009ZFPQOQ|5.0|This is a very easy to use and very helpful GPS app. The directions are very accurate and it has a lot of social options that make it fun to use. It's one of my favorite apps. I use it all the time, even when I'm just going from home to work and vice versa just because it is so fun to use.
B00A7ZWUJC|4.0|This album inspired me to review some of Rihanna's previous albums.  I really like the dance tracks Pony, Numb and Nobody's Busy.  My favorite song on the album is What Now?
B00G8P27PM|4.0|Solid all around movie.  Really enjoyed watching it with the family.  Would do 4.5 stars if I could.  If you enjoyed the first, you will enjoy this one as well!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I have a big fish account online and am really happy to see their games on Amazon. This is a fun game where you are playing pyramid solidarity and you have to beat the pesky gopher in side bets. Good luck and have fun!
B00A6CT012|3.0|I struggled with whether or not to rate this at 3 vs 4 stars. Very informative, especially the chapter on making your own cleaners. However, I'm feeling more and more that it is lacking in details. And pictures! I needed---and still need---pictures of many of the topics described in this book.<br /><br />The cover of the book is a snapshot of a room---possibly the living room---of the author's home. I had this idea when I clicked &#34;purchase&#34; that I'd get invited inside for an intimate and personal tour. Both literally and visually. But the majority of the pages are filled with text. Interesting text but still just text. And some major details are missing.<br /><br />For instance, Johnson mentions that her and her family use compostable toothbrushes, and in an on-line video, she shows them sitting in a cup inside the medicine cabinet but fails to mention in the book how much they cost or where they can be purchased. And what about certain hygiene products? In the book and in on-line videos, Johnson talks about making tooth powder to replace tooth paste. I believe she even mentions using a menstrual cup, but she doesn't a) explain how that works (I'd never heard of such a thing until a couple of years ago), b) explain what brand she uses (there are several), c) show what it looks like, or d) tell you where you can get one, e) for about how much, or f) mention alternatives (such as Glad Rags or Willow Pads etc.)<br /><br />Some of this stuff can be figured out by combing through her website, Googling words like &#34;Zero-waste lifestyle&#34;, &#34;compostable toothbrushes&#34; or &#34;reusable hygiene products&#34;, but a lot of things can't. I would totally recommend purchasing this book---and even taking steps to adopt the lifestyle as much as you can. I guess I just wish that Zero Waste Home was more of a comprehensive &#34;bible&#34; type reference instead of an introduction that will require you to seek out a hell of a lot more information after you've read it.it.

B009JZSC9S|5.0|Great cast, plot lines, dialogue - pulls you in and keeps you coming back for more.  Love this show so much!
140006922X|5.0|Very well written and quite informative.  I read a lot of books about religion because I find it so fascinating.  There are quite a few new details that I  had not read elsewhere.
B00AAI7B7W|4.0|Well done. Theologically, it shows that demons do not go out by rituals or holy water, but by taking the authority of Christ and commanding - not kneeling before them. I am not aware of Christ or the apostles kneeling when they commanded demond to get out od someone's life. No wonder both priests ended up dead. The movie is very well produced.
B00D5LC4GY|5.0|This is such a fun game and can be played while waiting at the doctor's office or hospital or wherever you have a few minutes to spare.  I like it better than the usual Tetris game because you don't have to change the position of the blocks. you just put them where they fit -- it's easier than Tetris.
0783225547|5.0|This is a terrific movie. It shows clearly how common sense easily gives way to political correctness. Brosnan's character clearly has a better handle on what's going on. Yet, his boss doesn't want to start a panic for fear of ruining the reputation of his office. Brosnan's character feels it's better to overreact and be wrong then to underreact and be wrong. However, when all hell eventually breaks loose anything can happen. Great nail biter movie.
0307742997|5.0|All Harry Hole books are fantastic.  Story lines, characters-all of it is excellent.  I couldn't pronounce any of the names or city names but who cares
B00BEIYMTW|3.0|This movie is a good one but not the best..it's a lot like Lightning McQueen in my opinion...I have a 5 year old who watches movies all the time and it's not one that I would want to watch 5 times in one day...BUT...that being said,  it's not bad!!!  I would recommend this to any parent/grandparent/babysitter who needs a good show for little people to watch.
B004GJXQ20|4.0|Great! Sometimes have to jump back to find out what character was up to last so I can understand what is happening now but very well written.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|really like this game. very addictive. just wish you could get more lives and not have to wait unless you pay.
B000B8QG22|5.0|Just a fantastic film.  The out-takes are as good as the film itself.  I like to revisit this film every year or so as it gives me inspiration as a radio personality.
B005GVA2L0|5.0|Amazing!  I've always been a passive Evanescence fan over the years, but this album really pushed me over the top.  Each track is more rocking great than the next.  Amy Lee is in top form and that band is killing it too!  The bottom line is, I love this album and highly recommend it to even the most casual fan.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app so much I spend at least 2 hours playing on the app (when bored) The only problem is that the Apple doesn't let Minecraft have updates very often so I have the app on my iphone 5 and Ipad 3 shouldbi get it on my kindle?
B00FLDG5AA|5.0|Another out of the park homerun collaboration of killer guitar players laying it down. CLAPTON and company. What's left to say?
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Probably my favorite of all of the Star Trek films!  It has such a twist that makes a strong reference to both the original series and one of the earlier films.  There is nothing wrong with this movie.  Any Sci Fi fan would love this movie.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I bought a number of these as gifts and have heard back that they are universally loved.  You could not possibly hope for a more compact streaming media intelligent device.

B00EP0KBXM|5.0|I know this movie did not do well at the movies but I am not sure why.  I went to see it at the movies and I thought it was great.  I thought Jaden was great and it was a new Wil.  I was moved and I could not wait to buy.  You should give it a chance.

B0036EH40Q|1.0|Ok i rated this 1 because i couldn't rate it a 0 the movie is garbage 99.9% of this so called historically accurate movie is made up want you watch a 99.9% accurate event movie watch Wyatt Earp oh by the way Doc never said i'm your huckleberry or you are a daisy if you do. he never said anything to that nature and Ringo never died the way Tombstone shows either and Morgan was shot first not the other way around i know this because after watching Tombstone i went and looked up the facts the facts and this movie match up as much as i am seen in this film...not at all!!! this movie is a waste of film and a waste of money do not i repeat do not buy this movie ever!!!!!!<br />AND THE REAL SAD PART IS ONE OF THE 2 JACKS IS ACTUALLY A TOMBSTONE HISTORICAL EMPLOYEE AND THEY STILL COULD NOT GET THE FACTS CORRECT GREAT ACTORS IS ALL THIS MOVIE HAS AND THAT'S A CRYING SHAME!!!!
1401235425|5.0|For me it's a no brainer. Scott Snyder is killing it right now on with Batman, American Vampire, The Wake, and Superman Unchained. His take on Batman is awesome, extremely dark and gritty and the stories are really interesting. The stories are extremely cinematic in my opinion, I could see them acting as the perfect screen play for future film adaptations. To accompany Snyder's storytelling abilities is the phenomenal artwork of the one and only Greg Capullo. I didn't realize at first who the art was by, but I knew I loved it; once I realized it was by the same guy who illustrated Spawn for a bit, I was hooked in even more. This volume collects the first few issues of their run on Batman in the New 52! and is very very entertaining and a different portrayal of Batman and his adventures than I've seen.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|A one of a kind book, that tells us how to be one of a kind too. The Outliers are the atypical people who accomplish things because of circumstances as well as talent. I learned a ton from this book. Since I am flying on an airplane today, I am wearing buckled shoes rather than slip ons because of what this book told me about who survives airplane crashes. A must read!
B00EL8JCGU|4.0|loved the movie it is a lot more than just a zombie blood and guts good plot and action. Pitt was great too
B00DWVOPHI|5.0|sensational package<br /> all cd's interesting, book essay very informative it comes from a new angle, a nice large poster too

B00EUUJID6|5.0|Love their music!  Voices of Angels.have enjoyed their music for a couple of years and hope they continue to provide the public with this beautiful music.
B005544TRQ|3.0|It's a relative thing, The Good Wife is at least 2 stars better. Perhaps plausibility and character development are lacking.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|Good entertainment with great dialogue.  If you watch Before Sunset, you need to watch Before Sunrise first in order to know what is happening.  This is a unique series filmed 10 years apart.  Before Midnight is the third in the series.

B008LXZFH6|2.0|This is a somewhat entertaining movie to watch when nothing important is on TV.  It has some funny moments, but only deserves 2 stars.

0786891416|4.0|People who think that ABC just reproduced a script from the first season of 'Castle' will be surprised- this is a sprightly whodunit that departs from the weekly drama. There is an entirely different chemistry between Rook and Detective Heat. Sure, there is a groupie autograph seeker, and he lecherously signs her chest. Yes, Heat empathizes with every grieving family after a murder. But it appears Rook is only acting egotistical, and seriously observes the all-important details at the crime scene. Heat teases him like an ordinary co-worker. And, unlike a TV program, she is narrating in first person- concerning both the case and feelings concerning Rook.<br />In brief, a developer falls 6 stories, the trophy wife is high-maintenance, at least one guy tries to strong-arm her, the nanny looks like temptation, and the accountant says all the money is gone. The city is gripped by sweltering weather making clothing stick to the body. Critical evidence must be subpoenaed- and Rook knows the right judge to get it done (how Rook can submit the paperwork himself is overlooked).<br />The squad methodically follows clues and interviews witnesses to lead them to the murderer; although not before Heat engages in a vicious fight. The takedown is a satisfying end to the mystery.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved all three books and the fact that I could download them to my Kindle was a bonus.  Can hardly wait for the movie!!
B004B8DH98|4.0|My kind of spy movie. Realistic, non high technology, simple but action filled spy flick, that might be how the real spy world works.
B0018BB20W|5.0|Like the blend of the music with the London Symphony.  Sounds Great.  It is amazing that this recording came out in the 60's. And was more popular in the 70's.
B00BAXFJ5M|2.0|What a joke. Reads like a draft written over a weekend. All dialogue, little plot. If Baldacci actually wrote this he is really losing it. Completely idiotic slapstick and entirely unbelievable. Save your hard earned money!

B002TYZKIM|5.0|I Have been a lifelong fan of this musical genius. First with the jackson five then as a solo artist. I related to his struggle with the child abuse he suffered at the hands of his father. Raised by the strap or belt, it made for a traumatic childhood. I have yet to forgive my father for the beatings but I read that Michael was able to forgive his. His music truly represented the man he was. I am very grateful this final footage of Michael was captured on film. It was fascinating to watch him back in action. My only regret is that I never had the chance to see him &#34;live&#34; in concert. And yes the man was very gracious and kind to all who worked with him on the process of &#34;this is it&#34;. It is sad that the media would not let the man rest.

B00005JO9J|5.0|I love this series! The characters are so dynamic and interesting. My hubby first introduced me to it because I was taking medical terminology classes and he thought I would get more out of the &#34;medical speak&#34; and help to &#34;interpret&#34; what they were talking about.

B00FAT9W0A|5.0|Much like The Killers, Keane is celebrating their first decade together and The Best of Keane finds the band reflecting on their success and the music they've churned out over the past four albums and one EP. It's a good collection for newcomers but this one has something that makes it a must-have for the committed fans that shouldn't be missed.<br /><br />Let's start with the standard edition, which is a single disc comprised of their biggest hits. Yes, I said hits. Despite the title mentioning the &#34;best of&#34;, these are all pretty much radio staples. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as many of their most beloved tunes have climbed the charts at some period, particularly the songs from their 2004 debut Hopes and Fears. By now you've undoubtedly heard &#34;Somewhere Only We Know&#34; and &#34;Everybody's Changing&#34;. They're solid pop tunes that have lost none of the charm and energy they had a decade ago. Other notable hits like &#34;Is It Any Wonder?&#34;, &#34;Silenced by the Night&#34;, &#34;Spiraling&#34;, and &#34;My Shadow&#34; are all fine additions to the mix. There are no real surprises and that's one thing this collection is lacking. Some of Keane's finest tunes like &#34;The Frog Prince&#34;, &#34;Black Burning Heart&#34;, &#34;Neon River&#34; and &#34;Sunshine&#34; would have been nice additions, although I'll admit that's more personal preference and each fan is going to have their own ideas of what a perfect collection should look like.<br /><br />The two new tracks &#34;Higher Than the Sun&#34; and &#34;Won't Be Broken&#34; are both enjoyable, especially the former, which I loved right from the first listen. They're nothing revolutionary but they find the band doing what they do best: writing an engrossing melody that soars and leaves you feeling elevated. If you want just the hits and a good overview then this is a great place to start. However, collectors and big fans may find the bonus disc included on the deluxe edition to be worth the upgrade. Complete with 18 b-sides and various rarities, it's an absolute must-have for fans who want some of the band's more obscure material and it's nice to have them in one place. Those who have amassed these tracks through tireless searching and collecting may find it superfluous but for those like me who haven't hunted down these tunes it's virtually indispensable.<br /><br />In the end The Best of Keane is one of the better compilations I've seen in recent years. The first disc is a bit too predictable but clearly the group felt strongly about these songs and newcomers will find it helpful in following the band's hits in chronological order. The real draw for the diehards will no doubt be the new tracks, bonus disc, and insightful liner notes. When you add those things in it becomes clear the band put a lot of effort into making this bookend to their first decade more than just a rehash. Here's hoping they have plenty of great music left in them for another volume down the road.upgrade.

B002RHGYOA|4.0|&#34;The Girl Who Played With Fire&#34; is the second part of Stieg Larsson's &#34;Millennium&#34; trilogy. The events it recounts occur some short time after those of the earlier &#34;[[ASIN:B002RI9ZQ8 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]&#34;. Those who felt that the earlier volume was a long time getting going will find the same here in spades. This book is much more event-driven than the earlier volume and its mystery is less overtly stated. Rather, the author is content to narrate the unfolding events and allow the mystery to develop within the reader's own head.<br /><br />Once the action gets going, the book nevertheless becomes a completely gripping and compulsive read and is very hard indeed to put down.  The book's ending, whilst seeming to complete, nevertheless leaves many questions unanswered and issues unresolved and the need to read the third and final part, &#34;[[ASIN:B002RI9ZPY The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest]]&#34;, is far more pressing for those who require closure in their stories than was the case at the end of volume one.<br /><br />As with the earlier book, much of the pleasure of reading it comes from the author's unerring character portrayals, together with the insightful deployment of mundane details of their lives (although once again spoiled somewhat by the tedious obsession with attention to technical detail that borders on pedantry at times).<br /><br />All in all, then, this book is a worthy follow-up to the first and should not disappoint fans.  If you've got this far though, you'll definitely need to continue with the next one.

B002RI9ZPY|4.0|With &#34;The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest&#34;, Stieg Larsson's &#34;Millennium&#34; trilogy fair races to its inexorable and entirely predictable conclusion. Or at least, as close to a conclusion as the author's untimely death and the loss of the remaining planned seven volumes allows. And by &#34;races&#34; I don't exactly mean that the journey through this book is short and rapid -- rather I mean that the pace is at times relentless and the author permits himself -- and his readers -- no shortcuts along the way. And this book certainly has a course to run!<br /><br />Would-be readers need not worry the book is any less gripping for all that it is fairly obvious right from the outset where its story has to go; the journey is every bit as nerve-wracking and nail-biting as it could be. The book concludes the events that featured in &#34;[[ASIN:B002RHGYOA The Girl Who Played with Fire]]&#34;, in a way that indicates much was carefully set up right back in &#34;[[ASIN:B002RI9ZQ8 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]&#34;, Stieg Larsson being nothing if not a true master of the long game.<br /><br />Like its predecessor volumes, the book has some lengthy drawn-out sections that perhaps could have been improved with some tighter editing; one can't help wondering whether this is a result of the author's death, prior to publication. Whatever the reason, these books are what they are: a fitting posthumous testimony to a great writer, with an eye for detail and mind as devious as they come.<br /><br />Recommended.

B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Hmm, where to start... ARTPOP was the first album I had genuinely anticipated in quite a while. I don't know why I put off writing a review for it for so long. Either way, this is my first time reviewing something that's still relatively new. It might come off as a bit biased considering I've been a fan of Lady Gaga since her first album, but we'll see. This one was on the horizon for a whole minute, and wasn't nearly as heavily advertised as BTW. So, what do I personally think? I'll give my short thoughts on each song as usual, so if you don't like a lot of reading, you might wanna skip this one.<br /><br />Aura: This one actually leaked months before the album came out, but I didn't listen to it til the official release, and I wasn't disappointed at all! The overall feel of this song is hard to describe...&#34;epic&#34;, maybe? Lyrically, it refers to the &#34;real&#34; Lady Gaga behind all the insane outfits and stage shows; the girl behind the aura.<br /><br />Venus: One of this album's promo singles. It features some very interesting samping with a lyrical balance between physical and emotional attraction. This one really gets me pumped.<br /><br />G.U.Y.: That's &#34;Girl Under You&#34;, for the non acronym-savvy. A nice &#34;bedroom anthem&#34; featuring many explicit themes revolving around the act of sex itself. Features some great production work by Zedd.<br /><br />Sexxx Dreams: The perfect followup to G.U.Y., this song has some similar themes lyrically, but carries a much more sultry beat. It's one of those &#34;turn-on&#34; songs that I often find stuck in my head.<br /><br />Jewels 'N' Drugs: A good amount of hip-hop influence in this one. Gaga herself exudes quite a bit of sex appeal in this one despite that not being the subject matter, and it most notably features three guest verses by influential southern rapper T.I., old-school favorite Too Short, and the criminally underrated Twista, all of which I've listened to before. All three had pretty memorable verses in my opinion.<br /><br />MANiCURE: Easily one of the highest points on the album. What's it about? Well, just look at the cleverly-worded title and you have your answer. The driving, power pop-rock motif makes for one killer earworm!<br /><br />Do What U Want: Another romantically-oriented song, this time featuring well-known R&B singer, R. Kelly. I had really enjoyed his previous work on &#34;Trapped in the Closet&#34;, and he did surprisingly well on this song too! Of course, the Lady shone through with flair as usual!<br /><br />ARTPOP: The title track is *arguably* my favorite one on the CD. This one touches on the harmony of art and pop, as it might suggest, and also highlights one of the reasons I prefer Gaga over most mainstream artists; the raw passion she puts into her music and the focus she has on the art itself and her fans rather than money and commercialism. The instrumental is divine as well!<br /><br />Swine: My feelings toward this song almost mirror those I had towards &#34;Government Hooker&#34;. It sounds okay, but I don't always like to listen to it, and I don't fully understand what it's about. Maybe it's the screams that put me off? I see this as the album's lowest point, but it isn't a bad song.<br /><br />Donatella: Probably the most dance-oriented song on the album. It's a tribute to Lady Gaga's long-time friend and well-known fashion designer, Donatella Versace. It contains reference to Gaga's love for fashion, and feels like a pseudo-sequel to &#34;The Fame&#34;, with its many tongue-in-cheek statements.<br /><br />Fashion!: Another favorite of mine, and a great followup to Donatella. Again, she sings about her love for fashionable clothing, from the subtle to the insane in her case. This song gives her vocal prowess a good chance to shine through, and it really gives me chills sometimes.<br /><br />Mary Jane Holland: A bittersweet, synth-drenched tune about weed and indulgence, if the title didn't tip you off. This one changes itself up a lot. Not much else to say, but it's something I can always jam to.<br /><br />Dope: No Gaga album would be complete without one of her heartfelt rock/piano ballads, and damn, this one really hits home with my emotions. Lyrically, it serves as the perfect followup to &#34;Mary Jane Holland&#34; as it touches on redemption. It was made as an apology to her fans for having to cancel the Born This Way Ball prematurely due to her hip injuries.<br /><br />Gypsy: Lady Gaga really knows how to tug at one's heartstrings. This tearjerking, fast-paced, and undeniably catchy tune is one of her most emotional songs yet. Another favorite of mine.<br /><br />Applause: The lead single was, fittingly enough, the last track on the CD. It's a nice, powerful first impression of this album with a similar lyrical motif to &#34;ARTPOP&#34;; the love she has for her devout fans.<br /><br />As for my closing thoughts, I've noticed this album getting quite a bit of mixed and even negative reviews, almost none of which I agree with. I just don't see what's so bad about it. ARTPOP met my expectations, then surpassed them. It's the first of her albums that I consider to be as good as The Fame. Better? Maybe not, but certainly at equals. This album's relatively low sales can be partially attributed to the fact that, simply put, many people don't actually buy music anymore, usually preferring to torrent it instead. It was marginally outsold by its competitors, Prism(which I also liked) and Bangerz(which I personally didn't see the appeal in). I'll be the first to admit that this album was largely for the fans and not for new listeners. Its subject matter was a lot deeper and less simplistic compared to the usual mainstream pop fare, so it appealed to the adult audience more so than the teen crowd. Regardless of what other reviews say, I thoroughly enjoyed it and think it was well worth the wait.ges itself up a lot.

B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|It is hard -- and almost unnecessary -- to add to the countless accolades that have already been conferred on the late Stieg Larsson's \\"Millennium\\" trilogy, of which \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" is the first volume. In many regards, this first part is also the best, with what is arguably the most satisfying story lines, which follow a brilliantly structured series of arcs that make the book part political thriller, part psychological drama, part locked-room mystery and, it has to be said, a fair amount soap opera. Superbly devised plot-lines aside, the book's well-rounded and strongly developed main characters go a long way towards making the journey through this hefty tome seem much shorter than it is. The author also does a wonderful job of conveying many everyday details of life in Sweden, through the inclusion of many little mundane details - although his obsession with detailing every single technical specification of things like the characters' computing equipment does become a little tedious at times. One wonders how much tighter this manuscript might have been edited had the author lived to see that to fruition.<br /><br />We shall, of course, never know the answer to that question but there is no need to lose sleep over it; the book's shortcomings are minor in comparison to its many strengths.  The book may feel a little slow at the beginning, and its cast to vast and varied that it's hard to remember who everyone is sometime, but do stay with it -- once it gets going it really does provide one heck of a roller coaster ride.  It is even pretty much complete as a tale in its own right, and doesn't require the subsequent reading of the subsequent volume, \\"[[ASIN:B002RHGYOA The Girl Who Played with Fire]]\\", to bring anything much to a conclusion.<br /><br />Strongly recommended.
B007V65R54|4.0|This is fun to read and very well written. Good layman's approach to explaining why random variation (noise) doesn't provide good predictions.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game!!! Better than candy crush saga. Most fun I've had with a game in a long long long time. Is that enough words?
B007I2BZIE|4.0|The music on this album is quite good.  My favorite song is the Wreckers with the theme that things may not be as good as they seem.  This is a  concept album different than any I have seen in that the story is told in part along with the words to the songs in the booklet.  That helps keep the listener from getting lost.
B00FRMCYQ4|5.0|It worked great.  I love having video on demand when I need them.  Quick, clear, and no buffering.  Awesome! Thanks!

B00EY8BRGU|2.0|Do not be fooled. This is not a good movie. It is entertaining and unbelievable fun for the first two-thirds. But it gets really tiresome in the last third and the &#34;twist&#34; is unsatisfying and in fact quite irritating. I never wanted to punch Mark Ruffalo in the face before, but I did by the end of this movie.
B00BATG18K|3.0|I am a fan of writers who are wonderful story-tellers.  My favorite is Rosamunde Pilcher followed closely by Maeve Binchy and then Amy Tan.  I have read all of Ms. Tan's previous books both adult and children and found them to be beautiful flowing stories.  Unfortunately The Valley of Amazement does not match up to her previous works.  Like many other reviewers, I found the book overly long with parts difficult to get through - the the middle section about Moon Pond.  Several times I thought I would just put the book down and not finish it.  I did finish the book and felt lacking at the time I spent.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is an amazing book. I loved it even though it was very sad at times. I would recommend this to anyone really.
B00CDTSFF8|5.0|I enjoyed the story, the acting was good. There were some anachronisms in some of the church stuff.  But otherwise, I enjoyed it and look forward to the next season.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addictive!  I can't stop playing it.  Some levels seem quite easy and then some times, I have to try, and try, and try - well I'm sure you get what I mean.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was the first book I downloaded onto my new Kindle and it was a great choice. While I felt the vocabulary used by 16 year olds was a bit far fetched in its marturity (no 16 year old I've ever met talks like that. Are we on the set of Dawson's Creek?), the novel had lovely comic relief to ease the tension and pain of the heavy subject matter. It was raw, real, and depicted relationships so clearly that you can imagine yourself as the main character easily. I'd recommend this book to anyone.
B000URWYTS|4.0|Great story - a little slow at times.  Great insight into the life and times of Frank Lloyd Wright's life.

B0064MPXFA|4.0|We look forward to watching each episode.  The continuing suspense and great acting make it an excellent and exciting series.
B008ASGP3U|4.0|It started with great promise but sort of fizzled about three quarters of the way through.  It still better than any other detective or procedural series out there right now, and Rebus is still on top of his game.  However, the ending was a bit contrived.  Not only did It become far fetched; it all seemed a little rushed.  I have to wonder if Rankin intended to do more, but realized the book was getting overly long and decided to save the rest for his next book.  Fox and Rebus going head-to-head was great stuff and I can't wait to for the next round of that duel.  This was great fun to read.
B002N44XSG|4.0|This book gives you great short stories of the percy crew. I really enjoyed them they are easy to get into and fast reading.
B009RH9HDS|4.0|Sturdy case protects the Kindle well. I like the 360 degree rotation feature. Unfortunately the half off deal was only available for the orange (yech!) color.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Fasinating, multi-layered story.  Much, much better than the movie as many books are.  Cloud Atlas is a superb, story, must be read!

B00ENXBUR2|3.0|it's a wonderful metal case that will decorate your room, and his four discs and extras will give you many hours of entertainment, but, my acrylic stand was broken and it doesn´t fit well en the base. reason because I can´t exhibit that beautiful metal case, Very disapointing the cuality of this product

B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Worth every penny. I am very happy with this game highly recommended. Game play is smooth touch screen is awesome.
B008EKOO46|4.0|The content was interesting, but with a slow read due to the variety of names and peoples involved, I would have preferred more abbreviated content and comparisons.

B00C1LIYWM|3.0|Julianne Hough is Katie, a young woman on the run from her past. Katie boards an Atlanta-bound bus, and gets off impulsively at Southport, a beautiful coastal town in North Caroline. There she meets Alex (Josh Duhamel), kind-hearted manager of a grocery store, and starts a new life. Little does she know, however, that her past is slowly catching up with her in the form of a Boston police detective (David Lyons), who seems to know something about her.<br /><br />“Safe Haven” is a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, which may tell you a few things about the film. Directed by Lasse Hallström (who also helmed a Nicholas Sparks romance “Dear John” a few years ago), “Safe Haven” is not surprisingly very romantic, but his new film does not stop there.<br /><br />For “Safe Haven” attempts to be a “mystery” – in more than one sense in this case. There are a few surprises in the story, but they are just a little less impactful than they could have been, as the story is told with little to no build up or nuance. Several supporting characters, Katie’s neighbor Jo (Cobie Smulders) for example, could have been more intriguing with a few clues as to why she gets interested in Katie.<br /><br />The film is overlong and its mid-section drags, but the film is not boring for the most part of it. After all this is a Nicholas Sparks tale and he sure knows how to spin a romantic tale.

B000JMKNJ2|4.0|A very entertaining series with a slightly different twist on thw whole fantasy world concept.  On rare occassions Lynch's flash back insertions can be tedious but still overall worth the time and money to read.
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|I really love this game. Ive had it on my smartphone and been wanting to download it on my kindle. I was so excited when I saw it on the marketplace. I highly recommend this game for everyone!
006202406X|1.0|Start to finish, not as interesting as the first two books.  The ending is a HUGE disappointment.  If you are invested in the characters, don't read this book.  Just re-read the first two and be happy.
B004UID2LC|1.0|worst apps that I have download. Good think that I removed it from my kindle.<br />I was not happy with this product
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|I finished this book a bit ago but at that time, because I was so taken with the characters and their stories, I was unable to distance myself enough to write my impression -- not a review, for I don't have that analytic training (nor interest, really).<br /><br />A wonderful, wonderfully written, wonderfully detailed book about wonderfully real college undergrads. I loved it.<br /><br />This is the second book by Rainbow Rowell I've read: the first was the remarkable &#34;Eleanor + Park&#34; (wow). I'd put this off because what I'd heard about &#34;Fangirl&#34; made me think it might be too jejune for me -- a girl who is obsessed with a Harry Potter-like literary character named Simon Snow.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />It <i>is</i> the story of a girl, Cath, and she <i>is</i> obsessed with Simon Snow. She has spent (and continues to spend) countless hours writing fan fiction with (gentle, subtle) homoerotic undertones. Cath is a freshman at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, having matriculated there with her identical twin sister, Wren. Wren is using this opportunity to branch out and individuate, independent of Cath. Cath is a more insular girl and is shocked and scared to learn she has to make her own way in her dorm, with her abrasive roommate (Reagan), with her classes, and even in finding and going to the dining rooms.<br /><br />I think a lot of us are like Cath, or at least have some Cath in us -- shy, scared to try something new, afraid to make a mistake / be embarrassed / be made fun of. I remember as a freshman walking into a large lecture hall and feeling as if everyone was looking at me and hating it, wanting to disappear. I'd decided every other student in that class knew what was what and had at least one other friend in that class. That's how self-involved I was, to not be able to understand that the class was probably filled with people feeling similarly.<br /><br />Cath's roommate, Reagan, has a friend, a boy, Levi, who spends a lot of time in their room, hanging out / studying with Reagan as well as appearing to want to hang out with Cath. She accepts Levi but understands he's Reagan's boyfriend; she doesn't harbor a crush on Levi. Cath is sweetly immature about and inexperienced with boys, having had a boyfriend in high school who seemed to be more of a friend who was a boy rather than a romantic interest. Both because of her inexperience but also because of this elaborate, desperately intricate world of Simon Snow fan fiction in which she lives, Cath is more comfortable on her own, though lonely. She may like a boy, Nick, her creative writing partner, or it may be that they share their love of fiction writing.<br /><br />Levi comes to be an important friend to Cath, and their relationship is lovely to watch. Levi reminded me of Anne Shirley (of &#34;Anne of Green Gables&#34;) with his easy, open smiles and his easy, open demeanor. Like Anne, Levi is pure and earnest, without guile, and I liked him so much.<br /><br />I also liked Cath. I liked everything about her. She felt three-dimensional to me. I know her. I've met her. At times I've been her. At times I am her still.<br /><br />There was another book, a dreadful, embarrassing book I'd read based on a blog's recommendation; it, too, took place at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. Its characters were all hardcore partiers, drunk / high / sleeping with any- + everything all the time, in fraternities / sororities and embodying every single worst, entitled stereotype associated with the Greek life at a partying school. I have no respect for unis associated with serious partying, so that horrible book only undergirded my distasteful impression of UNL. Yes, I am an academic snob.<br /><br />But &#34;Fangirl,&#34; which was also set in UNL, gave me a different perspective and reminded me how myopic I often am ... and reminded me that all schools can have excessive partying as well as serious students. Let's just say the next time I drive along the80 and espy UNL I'll feel differently.<br /><br />More importantly, much more important than my modified impression of UNL is that the main characters, all of them, were &#34;normal.&#34; None of them were insanely wealthy. None of them were insanely gorgeous. None of them were insanely buff, insanely svelte. Cath and her twin sister, Wren, are pear-shaped. Normal. Reagan, Cath's roommate, is a bigger girl, perhaps Rubenesque. Levi, Reagan's friend, is thin with a receding hairline at twenty-one; Reagan works at Olive Garden and Levi at Starbucks -- these kids have to earn money. Levi has a learning disorder, apparently undiagnosed. (The Special Education advocate in me was really taken with this minor thread, thinking of all the programs in place to help him!) How refreshing is it to read about normal people to whom we can actually relate? Cath is also a virgin and unsure how she feels about having sex, but as she embarks upon a real relationship where she trusts the boy and he repeatedly makes it clear how much he adores her, she thinks about it. That's normal. That's real.<br /><br />I am vaguely familiar with Harry Potter -- again, my children are too young to have been a part of that scene and other than when the movies are on tv they aren't too interested in that whole mythology. The first time I ever heard of Harry Potter was in the early '00s: we were at Zellerbach Hall (Cal Berkeley) to see Mark Morris Dance Group. I was wearing the most magnificent opera coat I'd purchased in Belfast (Northern Ireland): it is cobalt velvet, covered in intricate patches of ethnic fabrics, some with elaborate symbols. A woman maybe ten, fifteen years older than I and her children came screeching up to me, asking to look at my coat. The mother explained to me it looked like something out of &#34;Harry Potter.&#34; I turned to my husband and he was as bemused as I: the mother explained it's a fantastic wizadry book for children. We politely smiled and let the children examinemy frock. *That's* as close as I've ever been to any kind of this fiction-adoration. I was never involved in science fiction, like Star Trek or Star Wars, so wasn't a part of those worldwide phenomena. The passages from both Simon Snow books and Cath's fanfiction heavily sprinkled throughout the book did little for me -- maybe I'm not built that way. And perhaps I'm too obtuse to have drawn connections between what was happening in said passages to what was happening in Cath's world.<br /><br />My children are still in their single digits, so college is a ways off. My undergrad years are long ago, and grad school is so different. Reading &#34;Fangirl&#34; made me feel nostalgic for an undergrad experience I never had, one I purposely did not choose -- that was a bit of Cath in me then. The ending was perfect, leaving us wanting more and with a wide open road. Anything is possible.<br /><br />This book was beautiful, beautifully written, with beautifully real, human characters. I am so grateful I read it and got to spend Cath's freshman year with her. It made me feel like a warm fuzzy.
0736430512|5.0|This is a really great little golden book.  I really loved it.  I really like the illustrations and I loved the writing.  And most of all, the cover of the book is beautiful!
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|The whole family loved this movie - children to grandparents.  It was funny, action packed, heart-felt, and just a really great movie.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|love this game but would be better if it didn't take so long to get power ups without it costing.  thanks for finally putting it on Kindle.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I read this a few months ago and when I am deeply moved by a book, good or bad, I find it difficult to write a cogent review soon after. So I rated this and waited.<br /><br />But I don't want to wait any longer because every so often a memory of Eleanor + Park will creep back into my head and I'll smile or I'll feel sad, or both. Bittersweet. This was a story set during my teen years -- I am their age, or we were in school the same time. That kind of thing. I understood the musical references, the clothing -- those were specific to the time. I also understood the sadness, the isolation, the bullying, and those are most emphatically not specific to the time or location. It was only last year when I drove through Omaha for the first time: I did not see the Omaha described in this story, and I am glad. It would have made me sad.<br /><br />I grew up in a megalopolis, in an upper-class neighborhood, attended a posh school with mostly caucasian kids. I was part of the brainy-cool clique, although that was mostly accidental, I'm sure, because I was pretty, smart, but mostly because I was terrifically funny, and people are always surprised by a pretty girl who's funny. I am now in my early-40s (!), and now more than then I often feel odd-man-out, not part of The Group (whatever that is) -- there seem to be all these rules to which I have not been made privy. At my children's schools I see these other mothers kibbitz with one another, plan activities, and I'm not part of it, we're not included. At one of the schools we are overtly ostracized: my husband is a different race (Japanese) and one of our children is profoundly disabled. We have been told (via an e-mail) that people of different races marrying and having children is wrong and against &#34;god's law,&#34; whatever that is. We are too different for these people to feel comfortable, I suppose.<br /><br />While I am caucasian I'd like to think I could understand Park's feelings of &#34;where do I fit in? how do I fitin?&#34; Since my children's births strangers have stopped me to ask from where I adopted my children (they are biologically ours), to confront my children about being adopted and from where -- one of our children has decided to tell people he's Mexican because his second favorite culture is Mexican. (His primary is Indian but he cannot really pass for Indian.)<br /><br />I volunteer as a children's advocate: my primary focus is Special Education, but I also work with English Language Learners, Free-and-Reduced Lunch students, and At Risk youths. This is my passion: I love these children and believe they deserve everything. Those who come with the least deserve the most. My heart and my head hurt reading about Eleanor's circumstances. Too many children are in similar situations. Too many children fall through the cracks. Eleanor and her siblings were some of those invisible At Risk children -- dismally poor, living in squalor and subject to abuse. Perhaps the counselor / teachers at Eleanor's school could see it, could see her abject poverty, but their hands are tied by promulgations and sundry restrictions, let alone we cannot personally save every child. How do we decide, how do we make Sophie's Choice? I don't know. And this is why when I am working with sad cases I occasionally am unable to sleep unmedicated.<br /><br />If one person sees us, really sees us, makes us feel special because we are special, then that can be a virtual lifeline. While Park was not particularly outcast based on his race, he was odd-man-out. He looked different; he dressed differently, and he listened to different music. He's lucky in that his parents have and form a loving dynamic, and his equally loving and supportive grandparents live right next door. But he still feels alone and is cognizant to not want to rock the boat, to not draw unwanted attention to himself. He sees Eleanor against his will, but he sees her nevertheless, and she makes him feel seen. He fights it because Eleanor and her quirkiness will paint targets on the two of them.<br /><br />Eleanor was dealt a horrible hand: parents who do not truly love her, who do not understand that having a child means putting that child first. For that alone it is heartbreaking. Add to that Eleanor's appearance, and we did then and still do live in a vacuous, vapid society. Me included. Her startlingly copious red hair and being chubby (and in the mid-80s it was anorectic chic all the way) were two more death knells. I don't know why she chose to put her outfits together the way she did, in part I assume because she had little choice given what her mother brought home for her to wear, what would fit. I also suspect she was making an &#34;eff you&#34; statement, pushing her limits.<br /><br />There are times I'd like to murder my husband with my bare hands, and that's part of the love I have for him. He understands me better than anyone. He gets me. He sees me. He loves me completely. I'd be okay without him, but I'm certainly better because of him.<br /><br />At that difficult, touchy, desperate time of life known as high school, Eleanor and Park were able to provide that for each other. Park literally saved Eleanor's life, and with her postcard, she gave him hope.
B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|This movie was recommended by a friend... I really liked the effects, but the concept, the execution and the plot... OMG the plot! Not really that good. I've read so many books and have heard so many stories that these days it's very hard to fool me into believing a plot is innovative and unique when I know I've read it before somewhere else. If you like &#34;big things&#34;, then you might enjoy it. Otherwise, you're better off watching Battle LA or Battlefield. It's kind of the sort of movie they compare to. Also, I don't know if I'm getting old, but I found there were way too much shouting in this film. Looks like all the characters were deaf or something, particularly one (the one with the glasses).
B00G3P6VA4|3.0|Falls far short of District 9. Very formulaic. Acting is all right and so are the special effects, but the plot is just too weak. Expected more...
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Off the hook When you think you have it figured out they put a monkey wrench in it. Love Love Love the show!
B00BTZN91C|5.0|Love this band and they produced another great record! It reminds me of their Dreaming Out Loud album, which is one of my favorites.
0007466064|5.0|This is one of the most intriguing series I have read in years. Dance with Dragons focuses on half the players and gives you twists & turns totally unexpected.
B00DI75SWM|1.0|waste of money,  tried downloading several times. it took my money but would nit download.  it kept giving me a error message. piece of crap
1936608898|5.0|After reading this book for the first time 9 months ago I have bought several other copies for family members. Everyone that I know who has followed the whole 30 plan has experienced phenomenal results in their health pursuits. People often comment on the difference in my weight and my skin and my energy but they can't see the health benefits that have been the biggest change in my life...those are what I am most grateful for.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|My daughter picked this out while I was browsing Amazon's website so I added it to the wish list and decided to order it! I'm glad I did, because I think she will enjoy this along with her new Barbie dream house I ordered her!! Also will be perfect to store her Barbie's in while she isn't playing with them!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Finally it's here been dying to play the mobile version and I can say I am not disappointed at all amazing game play and graphics .thank you for putting up the mobile app.
B0087ZG7HK|5.0|a fun movie.  have liked this movie since it first came out.  Great to add another movie to our growing collection.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|A friend told me about this app. I LOVE IT! I do alternative healing work with clients and use the app to help them relax. With the numerous combinations I am always sure to find the right music for my clients. It's a life savior too, as my stereo system has been acting up.
B00B0LPWU6|2.0|Glad this movie was &#34;free&#34; with Amazon Prime, if I'd paid to see this I would've been beyond pi$$ed.<br /><br />The only reason to watch this movie are the first 20 minutes including the full frontal nude scene with Nadine Velasquez and the crazy flying and crash. Hence the two star rating 1 star for epic nude scene and 1 for unique airplane crash creativity.<br /><br />The rest of the movie is weak on plot, reaching, and typical of modern Hollywood &#34;drama&#34; BS.<br /><br />That this movie averages above three stars on Amazon makes me doubt the IQ of my fellow Amazon users, I mean seriously doubt it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its really fun great for any one to play its fun for kids to...its. really easy to play so yea
B00BUAEYVK|3.0|It was good, but nearly as good as the other Die Hards. It was different due to the foreign scenery.
0316055433|5.0|This book touched me.  As a kid with his own parental issues I found the portrayal of Theo quite on point and I became impressed that Donna Tartt, as a female author, captured the feelings of a teenage boy to the extent she did. Bravo.  As other reviewers have posited, this book could be several books in one with different genres and different themes.  That said, aside from the very end, which I found a bit long-winded, I was left very impressed by the way all those themes corresponded and came together in a unified whole.  I've read some good books lately but this one took the cake.  The historical alliteration, the art scenes, Manhattan high and low brow, Las Vegas, Holland and the connections to the Ukraine and Russia all combined for a pleasant and flowing read that I felt I needed to return to and did in a quick and dirty five day read fest.  Both philosophically and beautifully written, our author must be keen on literature.  And her work, maybe Dickensian, maybe Faustian, maybe that &#34;novel of the ages&#34; alluded to in discussing the &#34;fundamental discrepancy of love&#34;, is definitely one I enjoyed and would recommend to anyone.  Nice work!<br /><br />I wanted to read this after reading the NY Times review of it and luckily, my wife bought it and did so.  The bo
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A must read for any married woman. This story brought tears of laughter, rage and sadness. Great book by Liane Moriarty.
B0094KF4WG|5.0|I loved this autobiography. As the name suggests it is truely a 1st hand account written by a navy seal. Although the Osama Bin Laden mission dictates the book it is still a detailed autobiography of the writer's life. Not only did I enjoy the entertainment value of the book, I also developed an admiration for the writer as a well trained and humble soldier.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Just an awesome game, great brain workout!  I love the problem solving and some of the funny things that pop ups when you spell your solution. Great game give it a try.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is awesome.  I love it.  Challenging enough to keep you interested but not so hard that you give up.
B003B02O0A|5.0|Grisham is a master at delivering a spellbinding story!  I can hardly wait to get into &#34;Sycamore Row!&#34;<br />something tells me it will be even better.
B00DBQ0E2E|5.0|This is probably the most original album I have ever heard. I never heard of Battle Beast before I bought this album but now I am a devoted fan! Every song is unique and each of the tracks fits perfectly. The lead singer has a very impressive vocal range, the lyrics are perfect, and the guitar riffs are amazing! Even the keyboard work fits in nicely and I am usually not a fan of keyboards. I can't wait to get their other album, Steel!
B00E00GWBM|3.0|I love the record, but the vinyl came scratched and skips around. Watch out! The music on this album is fantastic, but the vinyl came so scratched up that it's basically unplayable.
B003TTKB5I|3.0|Fairly entertaining series with an easy to like cast but frequently it has pretty far out - almost unbelievable - plots.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  I would have liked to see it have more chapters regarding Fifty's new family life as a father.
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|Not the best FreeCell game I've ever played, but still not bad. I have no issues with visibility, or the app being weird or buggy. I'm enjoying it.
B00GX598FO|4.0|My husband picked this one for movie night but I liked it.  A little goofy romance mixed in with violence and action in various European cities.  Don't be turned off by the opening scene in a big box store which was really odd. I saw the first one but you could probably watch this without seeing the first one.
B003R1B9MW|5.0|The photography is pleasing, story wonderful, acting so very fine, and it brought tears to my son's and my eyes. It is his favorite movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A very addicting and enjoyable game. Challenging, but not impossible. I like that you have the option of paying to advance faster, but you don't have to. I haven't paid anything and I am on level 40 something.....very cool game.
B003P2WO5E|4.0|The first half was a 3 - too much world building and not enough investment in characters, development, and forwarding the plot.<br />The second half was a 5 - amazing!!!  Suddenly I could not put the book down.  I was hooked.  The plot started charging forward.  Enough said.  :)
141694737X|5.0|I bought this as a gift for a new mom.  The book seems sturdy although the flaps are pretty thin for a board book. The story is cute.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|It works as expected and is a good value for the money. I'm using it to charge my iPhone 5 and works like a charm.  I've also received several emails from the seller making sure it meets my expectations so they care about customer satisfaction and service.
0870703781|5.0|As a William Eggleston fan, I could say that this book is THE book to everyone who love his pictures and also who wants to discover one of the greatest colour photographers of XXth Century.
0440245915|5.0|This is a must read for those of us who want to purchase and read Sycamore Row.  These two books are arguably Grisham's best works.
B00G4I1CLS|5.0|Blackfish is a moving documentary full of insider information that may not be immediately available to the public. Before you ever visit a marine park featuring any kind of cetacean in captivity you, and your family, need to see this film or you will be doing these beautiful animals a disservice.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|The training portion of the book was a bit long although I recognize it as backround. I found myself thinking okay lets get on with the rest of the story.<br />Speaking as a combat veteran I found that the need to make a moral decision which ended up revealing the Seal team to the enemy was on the team and wrongly placed on \\"liberals\\". That is sort of like saying that the Geneva Convention is the \\"fault\\" of liberals. To me it was the moral decision of the team and it turned out as a bad one. I cannot say I would have done differently. In a combat situation in enemy held areas, killing any man, woman or child to survive is always a possibilty. They were in a rough place on what to do. Regarless, the team made it and Luttrell should have owned it without blaming people who think different in a political sense. We faced similar conflicts with morality in Vietnam.<br />The ability of the Seal team and the story of their valiant attempt at survival was to me the high point of the book. The book demonstrated that Seals are supreme soldiers of the highest order. Pretty good read.

B00BEIYMTW|5.0|My grandson in Maine loves this movie.  Being in New Jersey it's often hard to travel up to Maine and I was so happy to be able to order this and have it delivered to him in time for Thanksgiving.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Almost always disappointed with the movie after reading the book.  This movie was spectacularly filmed and exquisitely produced. The costumes were spot on!
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|This is a great game. It is a very good pass time game to play. I'd very highly recommend it. 5
B009NF54ZE|4.0|Nice game, over all. I enjoy the mix of challenges but could do without lame dialog. That's okay though because I tap through them.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|Excellent! After reading all the Dan Shepherd's novels from Stephen Leather (a highly recommended series, which shares some similarities with Lee Child franchise, though with notable differences), I had nothing to put under my teeth. Therefore I gave it a shot to Lee Child's Jack Reacher series: I wasn't disappointed. If you like a hard-boiler/ mystery / action-packed novel, you will also enjoy it!
1250038820|5.0|I love love this book,  Its refreshing to read the quotes or thoughts from people.  I mean I wish I had a job where I can stop people and ask question and build a story!
B00915G6MG|4.0|This is a 'four star' review but I would actually rate it as more of a 3 1/2 star season. I'm not sure what happened exactly. It seemed as though there were too many new writers or that the writers from past seasons were becoming a bit tired. The acting was as good as it usually is. The cast is excellent. Yet some of the story-lines this season were poorly handled, the character development became much more stagnated, and there was less time given to focusing on the different characters in individual episodes focused primarily upon them. The season is enjoyable from beginning to end, but what happened, exactly? Tony is barely being 'funny' this season, even when making jokes. Yet one of the best episodes was one Michael Weatherly directed and I don't think it's an acting problem. The writing feels as if it's less inspired this year. It goes through the motions too much, and when episodes focus on character development and a larger story arc they become jarringly interjected with episodes that seem to be written as if prior episodes were not made so as to add 'filler' to the time, expanding the series by episode count but not in quality.<br /><br />I love this series. I love these characters. Yet I found this season to be a bit of a minor disappointment. I hope the writers have improved upon this season with the next (which I still haven't seen), but I'm not looking forward to the loss of a central character (I will avoid saying who in case anyone is 'unspoiled') and I am not quite sure about the current direction. There were a lot of missed opportunities this year - Ducky's health at the beginning of the season was glossed over, Jimmy Palmer was barely in the season, and Abby was reduced to only working on the various crime issues at hand with less development - there is only one episode this season where Abby gets a chance to really shine, and then she seems to be a background character more than before.<br /><br />Not to mention that the finale and the last few episodes were more over-the-top and less effective than past season wrap-ups.<br /><br />Surely there are more NCIS fans who found this season fun without being anywhere near the quality of the past few seasons? It was a mixed bag for me and I was really expecting more from the writing team.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I thought it was a decent book. I was entertained by the narrator's descriptive style. I cannot however, give this book 5 stars because I felt the ending was anti-climatic for the books length and the investment I put into many of the characters.
B0046RE5HW|5.0|Needless to write too much in this review, as this is such a well known case. A classic Poirot, compulsory reading.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Well written and thought provoking. Interesting and surprising plot. A little bit on the dark side- but that's only my personal impression.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|Chilling!  This is the pure-evil of No Country for Old Men variety.  Harry Hole has his hands full solving this one. I think Nesbo is so intelligent.........I have read all of his Norwegian crime novels and have not been disappointed. OK, Harry the character is flawed, but aren't we all?
0142403873|5.0|Great story.  This is very popular in the UK.  My daughter loves it and I've shared it with all her friends.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I'd heard a lot about this series, but most of what I heard was about zombies which did not capture my interest.  I decided to watch the show after seeing an interview with one of the series actors on television. The show host kept mentioning the zombies, going for the broader appeal, and kicking up cheap laughs every time the actor tried to introduce a seemingly deeper, more nuanced theme. I realized that there was something more, and that the show host had probably watched less than a single episode of the series, or else thought the audience was too stupid to look deeper. I decided to watch and was hooked on &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; during the first twenty minutes. It is about zombies, but it is also about human nature, choices, survival, relationships, and the adjustments people must make during a prolonged crisis. The characters are well realized, they go through change, they live, die, witness, struggle, love, hate and keep going, or not as the never ending onslaught of the zombies ebbs, flows, and rots on the bone around them. I haven't liked a series so much since &#34;Lost&#34; and &#34;Breaking Bad&#34;
B000002QWD|1.0|Very disappointed in this seller.  I purchased 5 of these to send as Christmas gifts to my adult siblings who live all over the U.S. (I always send music, it's easy to ship, a lasting gift).  The items I purchases were &#34;new&#34; items, not used.  When I opened the package, two of the CD cases were cracked.  I thought, oh well, this can happen in shipping, I'll save one of them for myself.  I just opened it up to listen to, and there is a scratch in the disk, which causes the music to skip.  Great.  Now I'm past the return date, I can't exchange it, can't return it and can't get a refund.  I hope the four unopened disks are ok - they are gifts.  Merry Christmas, y'all.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Lovely premise which has us joining the character Harold on his improvable journey.  The media bits and over-the-top hanger-oners, were too much for me, but the life lessons are shared truths and the flowers and weeds in the hedgerows are familiar and real. Could be great for a men's book club discussion!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I liked that in the end all falls into place somehow what I didn't like was what the author did with some of the characters
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Wonderful writing, outstanding performances and the pace is just right. The cast interplay is fantastic. Costumes and setting really help put the viewer in the timeperiod.
B00CS74W0C|4.0|I loved all 3 books.I love eve n Gideon.I cant wait till the 4th book comes out.I really don't see how someone could not love these books.
B008602KQI|3.0|I did not know anything about this movie. The other night we were passing by a movie theater and I saw huge number of fans for the sequel of the movie so later I watched it. It was entertaining and good. I liked it.
B00EVW0SA0|1.0|Full of &#34;buddy cop film&#34; clichés and yet they never seemed to be able to imitate one successfully. Jamie Foxx's comedic timing seemed off...and Channing Tatum isn't exactly known for his acting. There is a reason he was a stripper (and that his best role is playing a stripper).
B00FVZJUS2|5.0|So Adorable! Better than the first one! The minions steal the show, I would recommend this movie for all ages!
1449430295|4.0|Great calendar as usual I buy this one every year love it. Great office humor makes for a good start to the work day.
B008133MDK|4.0|Best, one of the best shows on Television. It might disappoint a little bit if you are a huge Sherlock book fan but still, it is very modern and contemporary.
B00A7CI82I|4.0|The best way I can describe this movie would be in an analogy. This movie is like torchwood is to Doctor who. It is based off of the two Damon movies, but it doesn't really bring that much closure to them. Granted, as a stand alone movie, it has it moments (lots of them) of gratuitous action scenes and eye candy. It was still an enjoyable escape.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read.  Bought it for my 12 yr old granddaughter, also.  Markus Zusak is an extraordinary word crafter!
B008602KQI|5.0|Loved it and I don't normally like show that have violence.  It is only a small, but exciting part of the movie.  Saw HG II yesterday and it was AWESOME!!!  Can't wait for #3!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another excellent story by John Grisham! It was simply a great book, whether you're a first-time reader or a long-time Grisham fan.
B00GTZN0X4|5.0|amazed at the talent and vision put forth in this story and visual delight. First time streaming from Amazon and it was almost as if i had a blu-ray..no buffering, no stuttering, sound quality superb. It was obvious there was a vision needed to seed this story, and such talent to technically put this together, but more importantly a refreshing storyline with quality for the young and the young at heart. This will go into my library so that hopefully I can share this kind of family positive story with friends and family alike. What a treat, attention to detail, sound accuracy and physics thru CG animation. Bravo.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I think that the graphics on this game is fabulous. They always have new updates and cool weapons for me to get. They always have new regions for me to hunt, and I love the energy levels on it so I'm not constantly glued to my kindle fire. I also got this game on my iPod touch and it wasn't working well so I asked my friends and they said it wasn't working well on their Apple products so that's is why I rated this game with four stars.
B00GLX0Z8C|5.0|Cute movie for light entertainment love JA!  Make sure to watch the out takes at the end they're enjoyable too.
B00FAI2IUM|3.0|I am fourteen and are doing rough sketches of new body,  interior, and parts designs.  Therefore,  I have an interest and craving for racing.  I am familiar with the effort and practice at takes to master the skill of being able to drive even a simple sports car at high speeds.  I, then,  would not call this a simulator, given the lack of effort the player has to put into the start of the game.  For example, my brother started with an Alpha Romeo wagon.  At nearly the same corresponding time, I bought the Chevrolet Sonic &quot;gt&quot; and gave it a go.  It turned out, he and I finished at approximatley the same time, yet the stats on the cars were entirely different!  Both cars were said to have terrible handling and speed, yet it turned out to be the most manuverable car I had in the game...yes,  it even was better at cornering than the le mans prototypes.<br />  Another thing I noticed was how quickly both my brother and I &quot;leveled up&quot;.  The races are extremely short (about three to four minutes) and it is almost effortless to overtake someone.<br />  Now we proceed to the better side of things.  In every game, no matter the type, there is always something to push you on through the game...usually at the end.  I won 't spoil it for you,  but an exciting oppertunity awaits.<br />  As for the graphics, I would have to say that. they are descently realistic.  They could have been better, but it is a free game.<br />  I have either been to or studied every track that is on this game, and I must say that I am very impressed!  The replications are extremely accurate.  TIP: At Leguna Seca there is a steep downhill chicane, or tight s-curve.  I have not seen anyone my age (and even some adults) take the apex correctly.  The trick is to aim at the tree that stands alone.  Steve McQueen actually planted it there because his teammate crashed and died, and his teammate was growing it in his backyard.  At the time, it was a young sapling, but it wasn't until twentyyears later that, after Steve died, Michael Sumaker figured out that if the nose of the car is aimed at the tree, the car will actually take the corner almost by itself.<br />  I know that you are either very interested in my reveiw, or very bored of it, and, either way, are thinking I am a complete racing nerd.  Let it be so!<br />Altogether, Gameloft has yet made another good game.
B000FCK65W|5.0|should be a requires read.  warm touching.  read it in two nights as I couldn't put it down.  my grandmother gave it to me 45 years ago
B004Q7CIFI|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed 11/22/63.  The time travel aspect was interesting as were the details surrounding the JFK assassination, but what really captured my attention was the main character, Jake Epping (a.k.a. George Amberson), and his adventures between 1958 and 1963.<br /><br />I have no direct experience with the late 50’s and early 60’s, so it was fun to follow Jake as he went back in time and lived there for over five years.  His travels included a short time in the fictional Derry Maine, down to Florida, and eventually the fictional town of Jodie, Texas.  I enjoyed King’s portrayal of small town life in Jodie, and the love story that King wove into this novel.  I was a bit surprised how well King pulled off this part of the story, but King fans should have some inkling of his ability for romance from the Dark Tower Series, and especially book 4, “Wizard and Glass”.  King did a great job with the relationship between Jake and Sadie, and I found myself caring more for them than I did the time-travel and JFK components of the story.<br /><br />Since JFK was really assassinated in Dallas on November 22, 1963, I did not have any expectations for how King would attempt to change history; however, I was curious to see King’s view on the event.  Would King focus on Lee Harvey Oswald as the lone gunman, or would he explore one or more of the conspiracy theories?  King touches on his view at the end of the novel.  Even though this is a work of fiction, there is a lot of historical accuracy to events surrounding JFK’s death as I’ve found from my own research after reading the book.  I even learned several new things about Lee Harvey Oswald including the mistreatment of his bride and an assassination attempt on General Edwin Walker on April 10, 1963.<br /><br />The novel includes the science fiction component of time travel, but it is not really a major element to the story.  Some people may shy away from reading the novel because of the time travel, but King spends the majority of the novel exploring the events surrounding Lee Harvey Oswald, and just telling a great adventure story.  Reading this book is not likely to change your opinion of the JFK assassination, but it is likely to provide an entertaining read!g spends the majority of the novel exploring the events surrounding Lee Harvey Oswald, and just telling a great adventure story.

B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|I found this book to be really interesting. I found that Malala's story is different, yet the same as the other refugees who wrote about their life in the middle east. I found Malala's passion for school would actually inspire other kids in first world countries to strive to do better at school, because she values school as a luxury that most kids in the middle east do not have. Whereas kids in the United States are obligated to go to school but do not take it seriously enough and do poorly. However, after reading this book it makes the reader want to learn just like Malala.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Not a disappointment. I am absolutely hooked on this series, both books and HBO. Please Mr. Martin, I NEED the next book!
B00BXLU1EU|4.0|I don't want to know what others pass code just want to check to see how well protected my Wi-Fi network is, it work does what it say. It is a great tool to use to show strength and weaknesses in your password. It gave me my password so now it have been reset.
0307593312|1.0|Very disappointing ending.  It seemed that the author lost interest in the plot near the end and went for a very very lame ending at the end of a extremely long but interesting story.

B00GTZN0X4|4.0|When it comes to a) storytelling and b) animation, Pixar has set the bar impossibly high.  So, as decent a movie as this was, it fell a little bit short of Pixar's paradigm.  To use an aviation metaphor, I found it akin to Howard Hughes' Spruce Goose:  A lot to look at but barely got off the ground.<br /><br />But please make no mistake, I have nothing but big love for the geniuses in Emeryville, CA.<br /><br />With all of my negatives out of the way, it's important to note that my kids loved it.  And at the end of the day, that's all that mattered with this rental.  As far as I'm concerned, with all of the magic that Pixar has created over the years (classics like Cars, Monsters, Inc. and Toy Story), they deserve a little leniency...just as long as they don't lower that bar.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|How do you say what you feel in your heart, that seem to be the question in Anne's mind through out the whole book.  A chance answer to a question solves the whole problem.  Yeah, don't we just wish.  Anne made a terrible decision when she was 19 and her whole life changed.  That decision was the right one but terrible at the same time.  I love the way that Ms Austen wrote this book, I also feel that it was her best work.  The emotions that ran through out was incredible.  The only thing I would have changed would have been, to have enjoyed more of the  refound love.  It would have been nice to know where they moved to and the problems they encountered.  That much time would have lead to changes, I would have loved to see them get through them!  A new book to love for me.  Don't miss Ms Austen's best work, highly recommended.

B001F6TXME|3.0|I bought one about 2 years ago - it's only had medium use.  I've noted that unless my battery in the camera is charged to the hilt, it won't always work.  Now, whenever I use it - sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  I have to keep plugging, and re-plugging it in.  Also, when it does work, I now cannot review my image, unless I unplug the shutter cable first.  I'm assuming mine is just getting tired, although again, it's only had a medium amount of use.  I'll buy one more and if this one is as unreliable, I'll have to move on to something else
B0067RQYNW|5.0|Great for viewing and editing word documents, spreadsheets, and slides! Plus It's Free!<br />I use it on a daily basis on my Kindle Fire.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I have enjoyed the Kingkiller series tremendously sand am very much looking forward to the next book.  I have read many fantasy and science fiction novels, and easily I categorize this series as one of my favorites. It is thoroughly thought through, creative, well written and a joy to read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Let the fantasy of this fictional romance begin!!!!! Get ready for a thrill, and enjoy the ride of 50 Shades of Grey!<br /><br />You can’t help but be a little surprised at how the author does not hide anything for the imagination and loved writing detailed description of exotic sex scenes we all dream of.  50 Shades of Grey, is about a young college graduate named Anastasia Steele who meets a young business, billionaire, Christian Grey and how the relationship between the two steams up with new and different scenarios.  It is notable for its explicitly erotic scenes featuring elements of sexual practices involving bondage/discipline, dominance/submission, and sadism/masochism (BDSM).  50 Shades of Grey, opened the dark desires of females fantasies. The idea of being submissive is so stressed and looked down upon to most women today and this book opened a world of what it can consist of with EDSM.  The book demonstrates the joys and excitement and being completely out of control during sex.  It has turned the direction of female minds in wanting to be in control in every situation (like most of us do, and sometimes not by choice) and of being completely selfless for a loved one can be equally satisfying.  Read it, enjoy it, have fun with it and let the erotic romance take you places you may have never imagined.
B006IR6NH8|4.0|I purchased this wheel on a whim after seeing it online. It is surprisingly easy to get used to and it functions well with many different games. It seems to be made well with a decent heft weight and high quality parts. I would definitely recommend this for someone who wanted a wheel but not the setup that goes with it.
B000ICXQOM|5.0|If you haven't seen it, watch it. Cringe, chuckle, point out all the flaws and terrible acting, and best of all, when it's over, you and your friends/SO/family will be happy. How can you not enjoy such a terrible cult classic? Shop smart, shop S-Mart!
B007MC8YLQ|1.0|This was only on my phone for 20 minutes, but it crashed 10 times. Since there are hundreds of other free cell apps out there I'm not going to waste my time fighting one that doesn't work. Glad I got it for free and didn't waste money on this useless thing.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book is really good.  You think you know what it's about but it's really so much deeper and interesting than what you would assume by the title.  Great book for a book club!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Loved Fall of Giants as well as this one-- the second in the trilogy. I had a little bit of trouble recalling what happened between various characters from FoG.  A recap would have been helpful because it was more than two years between the first novel in the trilogy and the second. Other than that, I was wrapped up in Winter, the second installment, all weekend. I am really looking forward to number three!
B003ZMF26W|2.0|My first gaming mouse. Imagine you have to be a first time mouse buyer to consider getting this one. I bought this mouse because I initially thought more buttons=better. If you read the bottom of my review, you'll find out that is absolutely not the case. Honestly, the G700 is the only mouse I have used that doesn't sacrifice buttons for tracking, precision, ease of clicking or ergonomic feel.<br /><br />Review: Some of the general buttons are easy to program. I like the position of the top left, top right and the middle (the ones underneath the scroll) buttons. I used them a lot. The only button on the left side I can really reach is the third one at the back (the big one). Probably because I use the claw grip. You cannot program wheel up or wheel down to be a button.<br /><br />Very Important: The biggest button on the middle left side is in a very good location and it would have been useful; however, for some reason, Cool Master decided to not give you the ability to remap it. The button can only be used for storm tactics. I didn't know before I bought it that I wouldn't be able to program a key to it or else I wouldn't have bought it. The big button in the center of the mouse (underneath the scroll) is not programmable as well. Again, that's something you tell someone before you buy it.<br /><br />Also very important: There is virtually no online support or how-to's on how to use Storm Tactics and I still haven't been able to figure how to use it. (Edit: There is NO ONLINE SUPPORT FOR THE MOUSE PERIOD.... not just storm tactics. The mouse has no Forums like the Logitech and Razer). Storm tactics is very complicated. I plugged in stuff exactly how it says and nothing happens. The manual only describes what storm tactics can do but it does not give clear instructions or examples of how to get storm tactics to work. There are no how to youtube vids or FAQs. You will waste hours trying to figure it out only to fail. Your only option is to email CM and hope they email you back. I am still wait for them to respond to my email. (Edit: They did response about a week after I sent it. All it said was \\"Please refer to the product's manual.\\" I'm done with anything Cool Master. There are too many competitors to have crappy assistance like that. You shouldn't buy stuff from the no names in the mouse industry. While cool master is big in some areas, mouses is obviously their weakpoint)<br /><br />I honestly would pick another gaming mouse. There are a few other mouses that have the top left and top right corner buttons.<br />buttons.ivers that randomly pop up in your device manager. Razer Synaspe..... I don't know anyone in the gaming commuting who likes having to log in so your mouse can use the settings.<br />Honestly though, at $40, the CM inferno really isn't worth getting. Generally the Logitech and the Razer's are a lot higher quality and show you that there is a lot more to a mouse than extra buttons.
B00GX598FO|4.0|Not as good as the orginal, but plenty of action.  The romantic story got in the way of the plot in this one but not so much that you couldn't enjoy it.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|It keeps you in suspense from the start to the finish. Robert Downey,s character as well as Jude Law is quite a good combination. I would recommend this movie to buy it.

B007TB5WE2|4.0|Reads like a novel, tragic story of a lost girl from a lost people.  The Peking of 1937 is indeed on the brink, and as with most civilizations under imminent threat they ooze with intrigue and decay.  Worth the read.

B00DWZHTOU|5.0|Make sure you pay attention for this one! Half the fun of the movie is trying to figure out the tricks before they reveal them. Had to watch it a second time a few days later looking for clues I missed the first time.

0374530718|5.0|While the basic story idea has the potential to be rather dull, the story keeps moving, and develops in a totally unexpected way. But that may be appropriate for a story written by a philosophy teacher.
0062082353|5.0|A very good read.  A very tragic end for Chris. A good soldier, husband and family man killed by a friend while Chris was trying to help him with PTSD.  Tragic.

B008M87GJK|5.0|American news is so freaking biased.  Most of them all have a strong liberal view so they consistently tend to hide or never talk about things that their liberal politicians continue to fail on.  I just want the news how it is! The news should be a mediation stance between both views of conflicts!  That's exactly what this news firm does!
B00FLDG5AA|3.0|Is it just me, or did I receive just a very bad quality CD?  I wonder.  I have, over the years buying hundreds of audio CDs, I rarely got bad quality CD, but it has happened --- those very few bad CDs confirmed bad because when replaced with a second copy, the second copy was much better quality.<br /><br />I have loved Eric Clapton as well as most of the other artists on this CD, and especially I love the blues that have been recorded here.  Yes, it is a live recording. It has been my experience to often avoid live recordings, not because the performances of the artists are bad, but because often the recording quality is unacceptable, and I do not like the audience noise in the recordings. But some live performances have been worth the listen, and especially for those expected performances on this CD, I reasoned that I could get past the lesser recording quality and the audience noise because the included artists are all superb. BUT, the recording quality on most of the songs on this CD is awful, at least it is awful on the CD that I received. Very unacceptable levels of distortion on most of the songs and excessive background noise that is not audience noise made this CD NOT the enjoyable experience that I had hoped for.<br /><br />Had the recording quality on the CD that I received been acceptable, this CD certainly would have received from me a BIG 5-STAR rating, the music should have been that good.  But if I cannot enjoy what I am hearing due to poor recording quality, distortion, and excessive background noise, 3 Stars are the best that I can give.  If I could return this CD for another copy, I would be grateful to Amazon, but since opened, I don't believe that is possible, I am just stuck with music that I will not listen to again.<br /><br />12/4/2013 FOLLOWUP TO REVIEW ABOVE<br />After a live chat with Amazon Customer Service, I was immediately shipped out a new copy of this CD, at no cost to me. To Amazon's credit it arrived the following day. Amazon needs to be commended on its customer service, probably the best of any online retailer anyplace. I immediately played the replacement CD. INDEED, the first CD was defective. GONE from the replacement CD was all the horrible distortion and unwanted background noise. While the replacement CD is not a perfect recording, it is more of what should be expected from a CD as to the recording quality. Everything is much more clear on the replacement, which does prove that rarely one can get a bad copy. Thank you Amazon for your service.
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|Huge Tolkien fan, and thought it bears some resemblance to the book, they are also doing a lot of backstory found in the appendixes and the Silmarillion. The movie makers did such a great job with LOTR I give them a pass on whatever discrepancies may be found, and there will always be some. There are some in the book, there will be some in films made from the books.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham finally has written one that lives up to his earlier works.  It is a real page turner and I would highly recommend it.
B003UESJHE|5.0|It are very sober atmosphere.<br />There are many different things between Hollywood and UK films.<br />UK script are very considerate.<br />Even if there is no action ,But I feel so good.
B00BXZ3D6Y|4.0|This app works as advertised. I have not had very much occasion to use it a lot but  it seems to work really just fine.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another fun, engaging read by John Grisham. Back to Ford County for a case with many twists and turns.  Good holiday gift.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great time-killer. I really enjoyed playing it with my daughter who is 12 year old. Only complain is that if you fail at a level, you have to wait a certain amount of time to retry, when you have exhausted a limited tries.
B007N85POS|3.0|A little hard for the younger and older player but. a good time passer for those with plenty to waste
B005COO1X6|3.0|I LOVE the writings of Stephen King, so I gave this a 3 star rating because he never disappoints.  This story was good but I've enjoyed other stories much more.  A little to predictable.  You know that evil lurks and the characters will not fare well.
0316055433|5.0|Far and away the best book I have read this year. Tartt is a mesmerizing storyteller. I am more than 2/3 through the book and am really savoring it.
B00EVQU1VM|1.0|It was not my intent to purchase the book in German. This was not clearly indicated in the book synopsis.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|It wasn't anything magnificent, hence the four stars instead of five, but it was charming. I laughed and I cried and it had a bit more depth than I imagined it would. There were some pretty intense moments and it sort of made me crave the day I will experience motherhood. I an very glad I watched this movie.
B00FAVRHBE|5.0|Having seen this in theaters, I can say that the 3d version is worth every penny. Who wouldn't want to see all that &#34;timey wimey&#34; stuff in 3d?<br />The storyline is better than the average doctor who episode in my opinion.<br />If you are waiting to watch the episode in the 3d blu ray release format, I wouldn't blame you!<br /><br />Overall... 3D+Doctor Who+Timey Wimey Fez= 5 stars
B00CUG8GAS|5.0|I love this family. Dry humor, self-ironic, hilarious. The mum seems to be drunk all the time, which in this pioneer family is of no greater concern. Who cares if mum likes her gin - unless it gets them killed by a Kalashnikov armed border guard, of course. \\"The valley could sent you into a spiral of madness overnight if you were white and highly strung. Which we were.\\" This family doesn't live in a pampered, materialistic world. They live in the real world. Both laughter and pain comes with the territory.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great fun but needs a lot more levels. Fun for all ages my 6 year old is great at this game.
B0038P59A0|5.0|I love Robert Downey Jr. and I love Sherlock Holmes. I couldn't be happier with this movie. I love the breakdowns of how he thinks and plans his next move. This is definitely one of my favorites.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game it is so fun for the entire family. Give it a try you won't regret it I promise.
B00F30S0Y0|3.0|Unusual music. it was not displeasing to me but it was very different.  the lyrics are sort of religious/historic in nature as well. i found that a bit surprising. More like rock ballads instead of just a &#34;song&#34;.  I may not be describing this well.  i enjoy so many types of music that this was surprising to me that i couldn't really categorize it.  A good thing?<br />listen to the snippets online first before you try.  like i said i like it, but not enough to purchase another by this group. They are English and i normally enjoy English groups as they are more to my taste.
B00C7DGQ9C|5.0|Story line kept pushing forward, great action scenes, and entertaining movie. Not gonna win awards, but is on my list of awesome kick-ass movies!

B0063GORYU|5.0|Waiting for any thing is a problem for me. This is a great way to exercise my brain while I wait.
B00000FC5H|4.0|Great walk down memory lane. Frankly, there were some songs on this CD that i didn't remember at all. they were good but in my opinion, they could have been left out. so i just push past them. Many may like them- no CD has 100% perferred songs for anyone.<br />THe music quality is excellent as well.
B004Q3UL2O|1.0|This movie is utter garbage. One star HAD to be given since zero isn't an option, because that's what it deserved.<br /><br />&#34;Real plot&#34; of this movie? 2 nymphomaniacs, with a minute or two involving one characters illness. If actors simulating sex scenes for 3/4 of the movie is your thing, you'll love it.  Lacks in absolutely ANYTHING intelligent in the plot.  I've seen enough of Anne Hathaway's breasts to last 300 million lifetimes.  It was like that to bamboozle the viewer into not realizing that there was nothing substantial to this movie.  I was really hoping for it to turn in another direction - one which I'd finally find interest.  Jake's butt scenes could not save this film either.  I (unfortunately) spent $4.50 on this DVD and it's in the trash. I couldn't in good conscience even give it away.  I don't want to do that to humanity.
B000001EXB|5.0|After listening to the CD, I discovered the sound to be of exceptional quality for a used CD. There was no noticible skipping throughout the playing of the music. A great buy!!!!
B0049H9NVW|2.0|When I first looked at Takenoko, I was quite excited.  It looks great, the figures are very high quality.  From there, it all went downhill.<br /><br />COMPONENTS<br />I can't say it enough times.  The components for this game are GREAT.  The tiles great, the cards are great, the figures are great, the custom die is great.  The art on everything looks fantastic and at the same time, conveys everything you need to know about the game very easily.<br /><br />GAMEPLAY<br />You're trying to complete objectives on cards to score points.  After enough cards have been completed, whoever has the most points, wins.  The objectives fall under 3 categories: getting tiles out there in certain patterns, having the panda eat certain colors of bamboo, or have the gardener grow certain combos of bamboo.<br /><br />Each turn, you roll the die to tell you what bonus you get that turn.  Then, you take 2 actions (add more tiles, move the panda who eats, move the gardener who grows, irrigate a dry tile, draw cards, etc.) and get whatever bonuses you got from the die.  If possible to complete a card in your hand, you reveal the card, leave it out in front of you how many points it's worth.<br /><br />WHEN IT'S FUN<br />The first few turns are mildly fun.  You have some cards, so you have an idea what you're going for.  Everyone is adding things, moving things around, trying to do what they need.  Everyone gets a card or 2 completed and players feel accomplished.<br /><br />WHEN THE FUN ENDS<br />Then, you realize, the game is about 4x as long as what you've played already.  You realize that people have been focusing on one area more than others, so either there's a ton of bamboo out there, tons of irrigated spots which the gardener can grow on, or a ton of land.  Everyone then floods to get the cards which will be easiest to complete and it's sheer luck if you get the right ones.  Any and all strategy is thrown out the door in a mad dash attempt to be lucky enough to complete cards easily and quickly.  And then the game keeps going....and going....and going....<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br />While it's pretty and starts off promising, there are so many levels of luck to this game (the luck of rolling the stronger powers on the die every turn, the luck of drawing good cards, the luck of people around you wanting complimentary goals to make your goals easier), that it quickly becomes obvious that you could have gotten the same fun out of a game of rolling one very pretty and well-made die, and seeing who has the highest number.  And at least then, you wouldn't have wasted 90 minutes of your life.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game, hours of entertainment! The different levels are really fun, and I like upgrading my boosts and costumes.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is so awesome you can build a lot I've built a castle and I've found OUT that the nether core is you need cobblestone,blocks of gold and make the nether reactor core
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I've waited so long for a game that's this awesome! Love it!!! I've been playing it non stop and can't get enough.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|fun and addictive!!! BEWARE!!!!! :) I play this all the time, so addicting and fun. The music is hypnotizing! You can also link it to your facebook so you can get lives from your friends!
B007T8BYWE|4.0|But all the sizes are fun. Good interface, works very well on Kindle fire. Puzzles are well designed, and it is fun to see how the puzzles represent the pictures.
B003YT5TGE|4.0|This is a classic film.  Techies everywhere love quoting it and making Office Space references.  It's a bit crude, but funny.
B0000025D0|5.0|This is Springsteen at the peak of his powers. The songs here are a little more polished than the sprawling anthems on Born to Run, and the raw emotion with which they're sung gives this album a lonesome feel. Best listened to when driving at night. I can't pick top tracks for this album, because all of them are great; my personal favorite is &#34;Racing in the Street&#34;. The only negative that could be said is that the album offers little in the way of high points, emotionally, even the more uptempo tracks (&#34;Badlands&#34;, &#34;Candy's Room&#34;, &#34;The Promised Land&#34;, &#34;Prove It All Night&#34;) have an undercurrent of ache or longing. This didn't bother me, being a fan of pitiful, introspective songs in the first place, but it could bother some people.
B0064MPXFA|3.0|This show is so amazing. Buying this on Amazion IPAD is the only problem really otherwise it would get 5 stars.  The AMAZON program buffers a lot and also if you go anywhere --- even if you download it keeps looking for online.
1438074085|5.0|Great pack to study. I just start now but I like the books and I think it will help me to pass ;)
B00BBYZ14E|5.0|I loved it and my 12 year old grandson enjoyed it as well. He'd never heard of the book, but read it for his AP reading class and enjoyed it.
B008BDZOZY|5.0|This is album is amazing!! It is one of my favorite albums of all time. I hope they do another album. I bought it because of david byrne and now I'm a big fan of both of them! Who is awesome, the music video rules also. Weekend in the dust is my favorite song on the album because it is really fast and I love the brass in it. They only problem is that the crappy package it comes out. Also there is random pieces of paper that have clay faces or something like that, but i'm sure that was was david byrne's idea.
B000FA675C|5.0|Loved the authentcity of authors research and his ability to build suspense!  Enjoyed reading this book down to the last pages!
0987300911|5.0|With a lot of tips. I just start now but I like the book and I think it will help me to pass ;)
B008PZZ9M6|4.0|the had some good parts..but overall the movie kept me watching. to be scared of the big bad wolfs.thank you
B005CRQ2DK|1.0|I did not like it can l get my money back  l hate it so much l just hate it
B004X6PRO6|4.0|Very well written and well researched. The plot is insightful but can be a bit disturbing and difficult to digest.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|It is my favorite game to play alone but at times I play with my 5 year old who loves it as well. When I am on my laptop I play it on Facebook otherwise I play it on my Kindle Fire and have it synced with my Facebook. One of the main reasons I love it is because I do not need friends to progress in the game but I can ask them for extra lives.
0670022950|4.0|Stephen Pinker was produced a treatise documenting and explaining the apparent reduction in violence that has occurred as society became more rational and enlightened. Pinker is Darwinian in his effort to provide evidence for a change that is not self evident given our psycological tendency to ignore things that don't meet our pre-conceptions and to accept uncritcally those that do. The media, politicians and other vested interests emphasise how bad things are, Pinker shows us how good they actually are. I did find Pinker laboured the point at times, he had me at hello.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|the owl is driving me crazy seriously I can't even get passed the level I am on not in dreamworld blah!
1609611543|5.0|You will loss weight and be healthier if you follow through with his suggestions.  I can't promise that everything he writes is as black and white as he professes but we eat very poorly.  I think that this book pairs well with other diet books.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Makes you laugh and cry! Bits of history...some things you want to know, some things you wish you didn't! Recommend highly!
B008JDAC7G|2.0|So I've been playing super monsters ate my condo for well over six months now and it has always been free...  why is this a FAOTD if it's normally free on the android market?
B00B5HQL50|3.0|The premise is absurd, too many pyrotechnics and not enough &#34;spying.&#34; Entertaining but just didn't grab me. Disappointed in destruction of Skyfall - even if Bond hated it.<br /><br />  SPOILER ALERT - stop reading NOW!<br /><br />Sorry to see end of M.
B00AQAA5TK|5.0|Wow!  Great story, lots of action, great camera work and some beautiful scenery as well (especially the closing scenes).  I was afraid that I wouldn't enjoy a Bourne movie without Matt, but Jeremy Renner did a great job.  I'm a fan!
B000GWE44U|5.0|Awesome movie!!  A classic you can watch over and over : )  No matter how many times I watch it, I always enjoy it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really love this app it is addictive and really fun I love temple run I do but there are so many things I like better about temple run 2
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I really enjoy reading this series. I did enjoy the first book more but I am glad to see that America is getting more of a personality. I hope she really does choose the prince over her childhood love since I believe he is only looking out for himself and is quite selfish as he puts her in secret situations that could be dangerous to her.
B000NPXMTS|5.0|Been wanting to read for a long time.....goo good book good book gooooooooooodbookbookbookbookd book good book good book gooooooooooodbookbookbookbook good book good book gooooooooooodbookbookbookbook
B00CH26TL8|4.0|This is a fun game that has kept me captivated. Stuck on a level at the moment and have been for what seems forever but still can't seem to stop playing.
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|The story of Alma, a botanist, not only reveals her discoveries as a scientist, but also portrays her personal growth over her lifetime.  This story is memorable.
0618680004|4.0|Don't get me wrong;  I absolutely love Dawkins and his workman-like style of prose.  However, to my mind, he oftentimes lapses into that preachy &#34;professorial&#34; style of writing that is often off-putting for a layman like myself.  I realize that for someone as erudite and analytical as Dawkins, this is second nature and rather beyond the scope of his intended audience.  Still, if he would lighten up a bit, I think his audience and sphere of influence would increase dramatically.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|This was a gift for our daughter last year. Such a great series to watch over and over again with her.
B003O86FMW|4.0|A lot of specific individual personalities with detailed goals. Which leaves the reader wanting to read more and become intrigued with the creative solutions for each predicament.
B005LTDPJI|5.0|ELO with some great music. Telephone Line, Rock&Roll is King, many others. Amust for the ELO fan.  A great complilation of the ELO hits.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|Well written, switching from personal narrative to research and study of running, however, engaging and thought provoking.  Makes on wonder what progress has really done for us.
B0002IQEHI|5.0|One usually can't go wrong with Hitch.  This movie is really good.  There are a couple of scenes that are sort of cheesy (like using fast motion to make a car seem like it's going fast).  Also, be sure to watch the extras...one being with Eva Marie Saint who points out a pretty funny blooper and other interesting things.
B00G21XNKU|5.0|Plenty of twists and turns. However, the graphics where better then usual and the cinematography was really cool. Was just as good as the show, but with a more polished look and feel. Can't wait for the Christmas episode.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I like the product.  It works well with my tv.  I have a serious problem with Netflix.  I have repeatedly responded to their \\"free\\" trial offers only to be met with a paywall that demands credit card entry before the \\"free\\" trial.<br /><br />This problem has once again reared its ugly head.  10 days before my three-month trial ends, Netflix is demanding i enter a credit card because i lack payment info.  i think i will dispense with netflix because they demand payment for \\"free\\" services and their HD content is so far below HD it is pathetic.  I have tried every setting i can find but only receive SD or worse picture with large blocks of pixelization in the darker portions of the screen.  Before you say it is my ISP, perhaps it is, but COMCAST claims it is not throttling video and my speedtest.net tests report  30Mb down and 5-10Mb up speed.<br /><br />Chromecast rocks -- NETFLIX sucks.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I love John Grisham's writing style.  I feel a little bogged down by the detail but I always learn something new about the law
B00F2362IE|4.0|I got it for my grandson and he likes it a lot, the only part that is aggravating is when he's tapping on it the screen enlarges. Not sure how to fix that.
006202406X|2.0|There are a lot of detailed reviews out there, and I don't want to be overly repetitive. My biggest gripes are actually not the phenomenal fail of an ending, but more structural issues throughout.<br /><br />First, like many others, I *LOVED* Divergent. And Insurgent was one I devoured but didn't love as much. But Allegiant was a complete and total disappointment.<br /><br />As many have said, it was nearly impossible to tell Tris and Tobias apart. Doesn't help that their names are so close visually, so a cursory glance at the chapter title doesn't suffice--you have to really look, and then keep reminding yourself through each chapter. But I do not remember this being an issue before. So....what happened????<br /><br />The science. I have a college degree in biology. Not a PhD, but I do have a BS and my favorite topic of study was genetics. What it boils down to is this:<br /><br />You cannot regain &#34;genetic purity&#34; by putting a  bunch of &#34;genetically damaged&#34; people in isolation and encourage them to interbreed. Oh, wait--they don't even really encourage it. You see, the factions are so bent on staying pure to themselves, most people stay within their faction and breed among the same population of people with the same genetic damage. It might be different if the law were that you HAD to CHANGE factions and breed with other factions.<br /><br />But really, the best thing would be to let those people breed with the &#34;pure&#34; population and water down the &#34;bad&#34; genes.<br /><br />Or, as others have mentioned, if this society has the tech to extract genes from humans, they have the tech to insert them, too. Also, most scientists these days ALREADY KNOW that genes very rarely work in isolation, so they would have known extracting genes for one thing would affect other things.<br /><br />Anyway, my science background is getting in the way here. So let's talk story.<br /><br />Again, the voice was an issue. Also, the character reactions were inconsistent. Places where there should have been MAJOR conflict, or at least inner conflict, were glossed over, and other places where the characters should have been more logical they got all emotional.<br /><br />Plot: No. Just no. None of it made any sense to me. The serums for everything, the way these people go about it all, the explosions. No, these people have access, and are hacker types and scientist types and they would have been much more sneaky and would have USED THE SERUMS THEY HAD on the guards and David in private and there would have been no death from explosions. Not to mention the timing of everything. The moment Tris or Tobias learned of a plan, it was immediately implemented.<br /><br />The pacing was all wrong, too. Long stretches of theological-disguised-as-sociological discussion broken up with bits of violence and/or kissing. I won't get much into the Christian message of this book, but it doesn't work. I'm a Christian, and I felt preached at through the whole thing, although there were times when I wasn't entirely sure *what* was being preached.<br /><br />Let me finish this off by saying this: I feel awful writing this review. I wanted SO badly to love this book. I respect the author and her talent that is obvious in Divergent. But I had to have my say on this one. I wish I were raving about it.consistent.

B00FWLTPU8|4.0|A fun movie from beginning to end! Being a &#34;mecha&#34; fan to begin with, I had high hopes for this movie. I was not disappointed. The action was believable within the framework of the movie, the pace and direction were top notch and consistent with what would be expected from  Guillermo del Toro.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to use when ever I want, where ever I want to play.  What else can I say about it?
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|This is a hilarious, laugh out loud movie. It's actually the funniest movie we've watched in a while. I wouldn't recommend it for children.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I was a big fan of the other two books but this one was so boring and very sad. Very disappointed, plus a few of my favorite characters got killed off. So glad I didn't waste my money on this crap!!! A great series destroyed by one awful book.
B00BEPVAV8|1.0|I do not really care for it but the grand kids seem to like to play it when they visit.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Googe Chromecast is my new favorite thing. Before i was using my laptop to connect Netflix to the TV and this is not only easier but much clearer. Also a great gift too!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I have only used it once so far, but I really like the feature that allows you to review everything you have entered. Advanced functions, like adding a percentage to your total, are very useful also.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This part of the Lincoln story is not as well known as most.  It humanizes President Lincoln and increases one's appreciation of this great man.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I reread \\"Catching Fire \\" just before I saw the movie. That book was so exciting along with the movie I just had to reread this book. Absolutely the most wonderful trilogy ever. Suzanne Collins has become the favorite of a 67 year old man.....me. Thank you Ms Collins.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book tells much about what happens to children caught in the system.  It is fiction, but could be a true story.  The writer has considerable insight.
B003F3NDWG|4.0|I've worked my way through season 4 on this show.  Having never watched it on regular TV, I find it a very interesting show.  Constant bickering & veiled romantic interaction between the two main characters always leave you wondering if there will be something that develops later on.
B00GLX0Z8C|5.0|Very funny movie. Not appropriate for younger children, but very funny overall. I recommend it to any adult viewer.  Good movie. (the word minimum for an Amazon review is a ridiculous requirement).
B00CUMM8LU|4.0|Nor sure I'd like it after watching the US version, but once I got used to the characters, it was most enjoyable.
B004XDYJRU|3.0|Got OTA firmware update to Android 4.3 and now need to force close (or it does it on its own) to get it back a couple times a day. Tried to update the app and get an error and then says it will uninstall the app. Not gonna do that then have to hassle with paying for it again if I don't know the update will fix the problem. Please fix, not like this was free.
B000F8DB4O|5.0|The improvement on the 2006 remaster varies from track to track. Some were just moderate improvements, yet other tracks were dramatically improved. The gain (loudness) has increased, yes...but I don't detect any compression or brightness problems.<br />  On the contrary...the new mastering emphasizes the upright/electric bass guitar and bass drum and gives it consistent authority. The layered recording exhibits a more distinct and defined sound of each instrument.<br />  The background strings seem to have been brought forward in the mix as well. When Pat plays in the highest of octaves..the remaster sounds less \\"screechy\\"...for lack of a better adjective.<br />  The first pressing seemed to be a bit lacking in the mid-range frequencies-giving it a sterile sound.On the whole, the recording now has a fuller mid-range..making it feel warmer now.<br /> No bonus tracks or bonus liner notes, but no worries...the music is all I need!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I missed this when it was on air - it's a good show - but be warned, it's addictive.  You'll want to watch the next season.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Much better than the first book! Could not stop guessing at the next revelation! My imagination was so challenged, trying to guess what/how/why all the characters meant more to the ending than I could ever have thought. Starting Mockingjay now!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Additive.  Have to go back and harvest the coins and algae.  I would like to see the reef enlarge faster.  Running out of room for all the plants.  I am having fun.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|The kindled and tablets haven't gotten updates for the roller coaster or the hover craft yet it's kinda annoying please update the kindle
B003O86FMW|5.0|Everything about this book is spectacular and is extremely detailed. It leaves you at an exciting cliffhanger that makes you want more. Honestly this is ,to me, the best and most interesting book in the trilogy is this one. GET IT IT IS AWESOME.<br />#hunger games lover
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is the best game in the  world! My brother told me to try it out and after one try I was in love. This game is also free. BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!
B007SGM084|5.0|Love, Love, Loved it.  I cannot wait for the movie to come out.  As with most movies, I am hoping that it's not a disappointment after reading the books.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|Love James Rollins stories, this did not disappoint, a continuation of the Sigma Force family, I also enjoy his other books as well.
1843106698|4.0|This is a good source book for those who live with or know someone with Asperger's. I highly recommend Kathy Hoopman's excellent, accurate books, such as [[ASIN:1849053340 Inside Asperger's Looking Out]], and [[ASIN:1843104814 All Cats Have Asperger Syndrome]].<br /><br />I hope further, objective research is done to describe and study this Asperger's syndrome, as there is a wide variety in how it manifests. There are a lot of self-diagnosed folks out there who apparently want to hop on the Asperger's bandwagon because they think it has cache; those who are simply rude and make a big deal out of not washing, wearing dirty clothes. They prefer to call their issues Aspberger's, since they think that sounds more intelligent. In contrast, a real Aspie can be especially particular about body and clothing cleanliness; they are often quite sensitive about texture and scent (and sound). And many are not rude or insensitive; in fact, rules of etiquette are another safety-boundary that they cherish. There are severe forms of Asperger's that fall more deeply into the autism spectrum, where lack of empathy becomes a serious issue, but that is almost another condition entirely. Good luck!
B008JDAC7G|1.0|&#34;Allows verification of Google app Entitlements&#34;<br />&#34;Access the list of accounts in the Accounts Service&#34;<br /><br />Spyware is spyware and does not belong in a game/app that the seller is charging the end user a fee to own. I can somewhat understand greedy programmers putting sypware in free games, but once you start charging a fee for a game/app, all spyware should be removed. Ratings will suffer for those greedy programmers who insist on putting sypware in paid games/apps. Fair warning!!!
0307704076|2.0|didnt like the book. He's really condescending and critical. My alternative that I very much enjoyed was named Switch. Check it out
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|I give this 4 stars instead of 5 simply because the cost seems very high for the product. It of course works great but the price is excessive for a cable. However if you need a replacement cable for you Kindle this is it.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|Great! It was just like in theaters, the 300 we all remember, its nice to own this one on blu ray.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|I love it, the baby loves it.  This is the best investment I have ever bought for my kids!!  Better than all of the rest of the jumperoos, definitely.
B005NFJAT4|3.0|I love this movie, but i didn't realize it was the directors cut so there are many scenes in the video that were edited out (for good reason). There is no way to turn them off, your stuck with them all. The movie is 5 stars but had to give this blu ray 3 stars due to the missing 'theatrical version'
B00C8USQEM|5.0|I was actually really nervous about purchasing this after reading all of the reviews. I did contact the seller to confirm return policies etc as I didn't want to spend $60 on discs that were copies or didn't work. However, upon arrival I was pleasantly surprised to find the box wrapped and each disc looking brand new--no pirated discs!
B005BRS8Z6|3.0|Although, this was a quick read, it gave me a wealth of information, and made me reflect on past relationships and my current. This book was recommended by a friend, and a great recommendation it was.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Best electronic device I've bought this year hands down. Can't image life without my Chromecast. Completely does away with those horrible remote control navigation screens!
B000056BOR|5.0|The DVD, though not in original box, was just as advertised-in good condition and played well. It came in a unmarked plastic box to protect the DVD.
B00D7NWTSI|4.0|Solid entry into the Iron Man saga. Stay tune for the after credit scene. Now we just need a Hulk movie.
B0056C6XIA|5.0|My son is a fan of Bear Gryllis, so I knew he'd be excited to see it. I gave it to him rigt before he left for his first hunting trip with his dad, and he is still using it. He just used the flint to start a fire while we decorated for christmas......not being used for survival at the current moment, but at least he's getting practice in using the different tools.
B00G6YH6G0|4.0|Engrossing book....really draws you in. It is very lengthy, but am enjoying the story and the intrigue! It does read like Charles Dickens - but the story lines are captivating.
0061733199|5.0|Bought this for my 11 year old son, as he is fascinated with anything military/survival related. While it would never have been my idea of a great story, he loves it and the things he's teaching me from the book are so interesting i'm considering borrowing it from him sometime soon.
B00AFEY354|3.0|A cult classic for the millenial generation. Not my cup of tea, but the younger girls love it a lot.
B009GEYX5E|5.0|A birthday gift for my grand-daughter and it delivered,  she got great pictures at the party.  They had a good time with this.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|My son asked for this for Christmas, and who am I to deny him? A great movie for young and old.
1452101248|5.0|Absolutely wonderful. Beautiful book, great instructions, out of the ordinary recipes, interesting cultural tid-bits.  Dishes come out bursting with flavor and color.  Some ingredients are a bit hard to find, but substitutions work well.
B00GH4R95C|5.0|I. LOVE. THIS. MOVIE.<br /><br />I love the hell out of it.  It was amazing and moving to watch in the theater and I was just as moved at home.  One of the most inspiring and epic versions of the Superman story told.  Diving into the age old question:  why am I here and what is my purpose?  Man of Steel is much deeper than &#34;Superman smashes sh&$&#34;.  It covers the clash between two cultures, one based on predetermined order and purpose and another that embraces free will and the being trapped in the middle with the power to move the needle in either direction.<br /><br />Ignore any of the negative remarks on about this, they are from inconsolable nerds and the feeble minded who have no emotional depth beyond being hungry, horny,  And this is an emotional movie, sophisticated enough that your average child and emotionally stunted adult will have completely missed the nuances as well as the on the nose tells.  Pa Kent's gentle smile as he realizes that he's going to die, that he's choosing to sacrifice himself for a young man who just yelled at him and reminded him that he's not his father.  Ma Kent's broken heart masked with a smile and false excitement when Clark tells her that he's found his parents.<br /><br />There's a lot going on in this movie, and it's sad that so many people and critics were blind to it all and just complained about things that were simply stupid.  As I've said from opening day until now, &#34;how much more do you want in a film??&#34;<br /><br />I have seen this movie 4 times and I still love it.  Should you rent or buy this I hope you feel the same.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Daniel Craig is a great James Bond. Javier Bardem plays an utterly creepy bad guy.  With a little Idaho gun humor thrown in, how could you possibly go wrong?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Seriously this game is so addicting. I am quite thrilled that I can finally play it on my kindle. SWEET!
B00C7D3TRO|5.0|Awesome return for Fall Out Boy. Perfect work-out Album, finish your warm-up just in time for &#34;My Songs Know What You Did In the Dark (Light Em Up)&#34;, and plow through those weights!
B00BC5I6Q2|3.0|It's upsetting to think this is probably what congressmen really do. Hope that only one party does this stuff, but I expect it's true of both.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I love series and hunger games was my first teen lit read.  Found this after checking lists.  Loved the first two.  The ONLY reason to read this is to see what happens when a) you read th  worst ending ever and b) see what happens when publishers push new writers to finish a Series they obviously weren't ready to do.  It  painful to read how bad the writing is.  I mean...it's bad.  But you kinda have to read just to see how bad a writer can screw up the whole thing.  Also I saw the movie  trailer this weekend an  none of it looked right to me.  The movie is going to be bad.  They shouldn't have rushed it.  Did I say bad? Yes. Bad.  Worst ending I've ever read in all the years I've been reading series.  Worst.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|It was just a good Bond movie not great one which is alright because they all can't be great movies
B00G32TD98|3.0|Very scary and reasonably well acted. Plot and dialogue a bit goofy at times, but this aspect may be acceptable for this genre. Owes more than a little to The Exorcist.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Funny and intense look into North Korean life and thought. My first look into North Korea. It was disturbing but Johnson brings some humor to the lens we see his characters through.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I learned about this game when I purchased my ipod touch last year at this time. I had so much fun with it on that device that I was hoping it would become available for the Kindle. When the application was released for the Kindle I was so excited the screen is a little bigger on the Kindle so I can see when the trains are coming before they are right on top of you. This is an awesome game to play if you just want to play a game without a lot of brain power.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|Understanding to the transition into the darkness of Alzheimer's disease.  Reads like an autobiography from Genova's expertise on the subject.
B008NW67E0|3.0|My wife and I were really excited to hear this new CD from Mumford & Sons since their first CD just blew us away. I'm a musician in a street folk band (Don't Forget Your Shoes), and so I know how hard it is to write music and keep high standards. But this CD feels like it was just churned out to meet a record company deadline, and it lacks the innovative instrumentation and lyrics that so captivated us with Mumford & Sons first album. All the tracks are very similar sounding and are hard to differentiate with a few exceptions... Hopefully they'll be able to mix it up for future albums-- we are still fans of this band, even if we felt disappointed by this CD.
0446560065|5.0|Anyone knowing and loving cats or even dog lovers will roar with laughter . . . all cat owners empatheticaly through these wonderful books.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I thought the first two books in the series were very engrossing and couldn't put them down.  This third one- I'm sorry but pretty boring.  I didn't like the dual narration of both Tris AND 4.  The writing was so similar for both characters I couldn't distinguish between the two and kept getting confused who was actually talking etc. The end was totally predictable.  And I felt the author put in an &#34;obligatory PC&#34; side story that was not necessary to the story line,  it felt forced like she was trying to curry favor with that political/lifestyle group.
B000ICLRIE|5.0|Best movie about medieval times so far. The cast includes famous actors: Orlando Bloom, Jeremy Irons, Edward Norton. The music and  scenery just amazing! As usual, the plot is different from history facts, however, Scott created a masterpiece.<br />I will recommend the director's cut.
039916409X|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Margaret's work and this book is more proof of the power of EFT. This book was well-written, clearly explained, and I am positive that this will be a book I will keep coming back to. I also loved the bonus videos that accompany this. The only think better would be an in-person session with Margaret, but for the price of admission, this book is fabulous. I can't stop raving about it!
0385335989|5.0|This is my favorite from Outlander series! I truly think there is no better writer than Diana. Fiction and history twisted so well together!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing I could not put it down. If your looking for an exiting book read this one it's great
B002ZG976U|5.0|It was just what my daughter wanted. Was shipped quickly.  I know she will be thrilled Christmas Morning.  Can't wait to see her face when she opens it!
B004SOR4H6|3.0|It's okay, it's hard to get contacts to show up or to navigate to see other pages.  would rather text.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I'm so sorry that Vince Flynn has passed away.  I've read all his books with great enthusiasm and was hoping for more when I read of his death.  His characters are vivid and his stories, while predictable after a while, kept my attention and made me even more aware of the terrorism we live with in the world today.  Not only were the stories timely and often reminded us of events in the current or recent headlines, but also they unfolded in a way that often kept me reading far into the night.  Thank you, Vince Flynn, for entertaining and enlightening us for many years.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it!!!!!  I could play Candy Crush all day!!!  So could my kids!!  I hope they make more than 500 levels.
B00589AYWW|5.0|Barbara Tuchman is such an outstanding writer.  She synthesizes a great deal of historical information and presents it as an approachable, interesting story.  My only difficulty with her writing is that she assumes a lot of knowledge of history that I, as her reader, don't always have, so I am encouraged to look into more and seek more information about historical events, which can be a challenge.  I found that I would stop reading this book and turn to something lighter for a break and then return to the challenge of continuing my reading of &#34;The March of Folly.&#34;.  I've been curious about Viet Nam for many years since I lived through that period in American history as a young adult and had trouble gaining a realistic perspective on all the events leading up to and during the Viet Nam war.  I have learned so much through reading this book and I know that although this is my first Barbara Tuchman book, it definitely won't be my last.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love It!  I love the imagination opportunity it gives my kids to do!  It's great for on the go and waiting in places!
B00GSAC1UI|5.0|Wonderful harmonizing. The 7th song, Little Drummer Boy is my favorite. I first saw the video of that song on Youtube and knew I had to buy the mp3 and when I saw they had a whole Christmas album, I couldn't wait to download it from Amazon.
B00D1DBO1C|5.0|I Love it!!!  I like the fact that it can sync more than one calendar, and that I can use it to send my family reminders of days events! through google calendar too!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Game. Definitely recommend getting this. I just wish it had captain marvel in it. How can you have black adam but no captain marvel
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|My kids love to play this!  Not the best Angry birds to down load, but we love the variety of Angry birds apps to get!
B0084TWN9K|4.0|This is an uneven collection of stories, some better than others and disappointingly some I had already read before though I couldn't remember where. Alice Munro is  a master at the form so it was overall very worth reading.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I think it's a rocking good app free or not. I just wish the load out time for the energy core was faster. Puts me in mind of the same mainframe used for mafia wars and mobsters
B008476HBM|5.0|Can't beat the timeless story of miss Elizabeth and her crazy family or the snobbish Mr Darcy who almost let's love slip through his fingers when miss Elizabeth takes Mr Darcy's prejudicem to heart and let's her pride get in the way
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I didn't like this one as much as the others. Hard to follow chapters going back and forth between characters and was to predictable. But you have to read it to see how it ends.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Well first of I would say this game is very intriguing and interesting but however some times the app will just stop working but must games do that so it is acceptable. Congrats zynga game network you have one again created an excellent game so if you are reading this review I say get this and the best part is that it's free and a good game
B0055B7IPE|5.0|We enjoyed watching the movie. It's such a cute animation movie and so much to learn from. Worth a watch
B00G6ZTM3Y|4.0|First off I must say this is an excellent game even though it isn't free it is good but  at some parts very complicated good job 505 games on terraria you have just made a new fan whoever is are reading this review buy this game it is excellent
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Fun game sort of expensive if you aren't patient but the game is addictive and my kids love it too
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Does not get me to my notifications. I guess if I can't get in to my fb page with a quick app, then they need to give directions.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game will keep everyone in the family entertained for several hours. It has new content often enough to keep from getting boring.<br />Good game for every age group.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|omg this update for Ninon rush did a pretty awesome job I really love this app so I recommend this app and a little tip to the fans you should get the mall.area beacause. its really funny when you bump into the mall people andagain I recommend this app for kids ages 6 and up xoxo to fans
B00GGEV828|5.0|Awesome movie, I cannot wait for the next The Hobbit!!<br />Instant video service is really useful and convience!<br />I would like to use it again!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|So far a good game, but know one of my quests is to buy a barn and for some reason is not letting me do it :(
B00F2362IE|1.0|I can't give it an accurate review because it wouldn't install correctly. I tried to install it on my Galax Note 3
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|This is one of the greatest sequels in Disney history. Great use of rivalries, fraternities, and all the little extras that make Disney movies like this one amazing.
B00DPH7QFM|5.0|Fantastic, This is Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow last tour and He has gone in a different musical direction with Blackmore's Night. This was a great tour and this concert captures it very well. It Rocks, Blackmore was especially on fire during that tour, perhaps knowing it would be the end of his hard rock career. The DVD looks and sounds great and its a great set. I saw a show on this tour in Las Vegas NV, at the Huntridge Theater, it was an old Movie Theater they converted into a concert house and it was a great venue. Plush seats small and interment and Blackmore was just on fire that night. It was one of the top three Guitar performances I did ever see. This is a must have for all Blackmore Fans.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Injustice is the just amazing.It really has awesome graphics and game play.You can play as heroes as well as villains. Playing as the villains is awesome. I finished Arkham City Lockdown and thought it was the best but this is better than the best. The console version is awesome and mobile version has almost the graphics.More than 50 characters to play and customize. This is an epic game for players who enjoy fighting.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Wow.  This is an extraordinary book.  Long ago, I was an avid Stephen King reader.  He kind of faded away for me, although &#34;The Stand&#34; was an epic novel that I still find as one of my all time favorite books.  However, this book may actually surpass that one.  King intertwines fiction and fact for a novel that is all-consuming.  I couldn't read it fast enough.  His characters are well-developed, the story is fantastic.  This one is more drama with a little sci-fi blended in (time-travel); do not expect a horror novel here.  Read it and enjoy it.  I certainly did.
B00CCR9P0U|4.0|The best spiralizer I've used yet...it does take some pressure to press down the vege, still a good product for the price.
B003G4W49C|3.0|I enjoyed this book but it dragged in parts and lacked action.  Hard to see how this could make a good movie.
1439170045|5.0|I have a friend going through progressive dementia and this book was recommended by another friend for us all to read.  We began noticing little things about 4 years ago but talking with her husband didn't help in the least until another friend got his attention and we contacted her children to intervene - they live out of town.  The book is accurate and I feel is an important description of the future of the person with dementia.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it I'm definitely addicted<br />It's got great color and the levels are fun yet some are difficult<br />Love it
0756686970|5.0|Great resource for us Lego fans!  Lots of good information and descriptions of clothing, hands, faces, etc. and what years and sets they came in.  Especially good if you are reselling or trying to find all the parts of your child's sets.
B0084IG8TM|1.0|I don't know what the rave about this movie is all about.  I watched this movie because Hunger Games 2 was coming out and I wanted to know part 1.<br /><br />The story is predictable if you've seen a lot of movies (including foreign movies).<br /><br />The story is analogous to Rome and its gladiators fighting to the death as entertainment for the citizens and the contestants are on stage (or in this case, kind of like the Truman Show movie) where there are cameras watching every move that the contestants make and the people behind the tv show can interact with the contestants through computers.<br /><br />However, kids killing kids is just tasteless. Hollywood is encouraging real-life massacres like COLUMBINE school, SANDY HOOK Elementary School, University of Texas.  I hope Hollywood feels responsible when school massacres happen because it is perpetuating it.  At least the romans used adults whereas Hollywood used kids.  The parents of these kid actors are pimps prostituting their kids to Hollywood for a buck.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: Not recommended, I was bored and I was disgusted that so many people participated in this movie about kids killing kids.
1440503257|5.0|Very British recipes - I now know what Spotted Dick is and that the English refer to &#34;pudding&#34; as just about any dessert.  I have only tried a few recipes so far but look forward to trying some more in the near future.  Fun book to read.
B00DW1WR14|4.0|I cannot stop listening to this album.  Every song stands out in a different way.  For me, it feels like a beautiful blending of what Pearl Jam was in its origins and who they are today.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|There are a lot of differences between the book and the movie, both in terms of plot and in terms of characters' personalities. The overall idea is the same though. There was a lot more talk about God in the book, but it never came across as preachy, it just came across as an aspect of Pat's character. If I had to choose, I would probably say I enjoyed the movie more, but both the book and the movie are great.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The hunger games is a really exciting auction packed series by Suzanne Collins it's great for teens and adults  and I love the whole thing!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I have this inky kindle and I let my brother play it and it really entertains him! So this means more time to my self:)
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Greatly deviates from the classic Bond formula with great success.Continues the Craig films' style of modernizing Bond while not completely abandoning what made him so successful to begin with. With all the great things I'd heard before watching this I figured I was bound to be disappointed, not so. Definitely one of the best Bond movies I've ever seen. I'll probably eventually pick this up on blu ray, highly recommend it.
B00BXDOSXS|5.0|I have downloaded over 10 video players to find  this one it's the first to not freeze or crash using bdrips and mkv files
B000FC2OHA|5.0|I bought this book a few years ago and immediately got engrossed. We all go through tough times in our lives and though this book doesn’t necessarily make any huge revelations it uses a friendly encouraging tone to help you get back on your feet.<br />(OFF TOPIC: Before I read this book I wouldn’t even venture in the financial world. Thanks to some of its references I picked up a book “Rich Dad, Poor Dad” and though I enjoyed the reading I must discourage anyone from enrolling on their seminars as they felt like high promising scams.<br />Not to discredit their programs, I am sure some people use that knowledge and find a way to cash in but from personal experience it felt like they were just trying to collect loads of money by testing how committed you are to learning.)
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I gave this series 3 stars because it was a very creative story, with engaging main characters. The post apocalyptic world Roth created was an unusual and well thought out place with corrupt governments, generations of history and lies, and people who are so real you don't know whether to love them or hate them. The first book of the series was by far the best. The second book keeps you on your toes like the first. There's much to be said for the first 2 books. They truly are well written and exciting. But Roth loses me in the 3rd installment. By this time, Roth leaves our main character with very few people she truly cares about. So when the ending of the series comes around, I was left feeling a little empty and confused as to why the main character gave her life for something that we (as the audience) feel disconnected to. Tris has no one left she really cares about in Chicago, which causes the readers to lose interest in the need to &#34;save the people of Chicago&#34;. I enjoyed the series, but the end was a disappointment because I felt like Tris died for nothing.  But like I said, I enjoyed the first 2 books and if I was simply reviewing the first 2 I would have given it 5 stars.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This movie looks spectacular on my HDTV and I got it at a great price! I love the lighting deals!
B001QWBM62|4.0|Good portible device, but has some really big flaws for people looking for a portible recorder.<br /><br />If you are a musician looking for a good portible omni-directional microphone with a built in recorder, this is a great device. It is very simple and easy to use.<br /><br />If you are looking into this device for the XLR inputs with a recorder, this device leaves much wanted for its pre-amp...<br /><br />This device XLR inputs are noisy and do not amplfy well as the white noise from the device/pre-amp is quite in satisfactory.<br /><br />I have been looking for good devices for boom mics, and if you really have to this device does it okay... but I would consider finding/renting a good portible feild recorder to use instead.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Can't put it down whenever I start it. I've read the series multiple times. It's a grrrreat book. Read it!!
B00CKH9WOQ|5.0|Amazing. These dolls are so beautiful and the quality is very good.<br />I strongly recommend this product. Children will love it.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|This is a great update on an old favorite. I lost many hours as a child playing this on windows. Now with achievements its so much better.
B00FHB7398|5.0|I enjoyed this game a lot it was fun & captivating. I like the hints, they were great. Don't forget the extra games at the end.
B00GWEPPE4|5.0|This show is so awesome. Every season just keeps getting better. In every way there are twists and turns and it shocks me. TWD is riveting.
B00FHATBGW|3.0|I am stuck on this game & can't seem to get around the symbol of the flowers. The game won't let me install the rose, which is what the game is telling me to do
0805092447|5.0|A CLASSIC THAT EVERY CHILD NEEDS!  i READ IT TO ALL MY PRESCHOOL CHILDREN AND TO MY OWN CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN
B0087IT8LO|5.0|Excellent movie!!! I wish this movie had more advertisement over in the US. It touches the soul in a wonderful way! It's sort of like Remember the Titans, RADIO, and the Blind Side. We watched the original French version with English subtitles.  We had no trouble reading and following the story!!!! GREAT MOVIE!
B002NZK5QY|2.0|this is the 2nd copy i've purchased recently that doesn't allow me to see the end of the movie.<br /><br />some pimply-faced computer nerd who knows how to continue these movies probably needs to interceed.  i can't seem to do it!!!!<br /><br />i've purchased my last dvd from you folks.<br /><br />with the luck i've been having on vacuum tube purchases from you lately,  i don't think i'm discounting issues!!!<br /><br />yes.  this is the 2nd amadeaus i've purchased from you.<br /><br />i was peacefully watching the movie when it stopped for no reason.<br /><br />what appeared was that mindless interjection on what should be done next.  i repeatedly selected return to movie,<br /><br />which it did.... starting from the beginning. i was given no opportunity to continue the movie where i left off.<br /><br />whoever dreamed up this format should be taken out and shot!!!<br /><br />i'm a staunch believer in eliminating people who create frustrations like this...... before anymore like them are bred!!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|A disappointing end to the series. what a waste. It was really a bad ending. I am sorry I read this book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|At first I wasn't sure I'd like this game but it turned out to be challenging.  :) I can't wait to get farther in the game<br />T
B004UID2LC|2.0|I love this app and I have been using it for awhile but recently it has been crashing when I try to download a song. I've tried restarting the app but it doesn't help. It starts to download a song then it just closes, and when I reopen the app there is no indication that it had been downloading. Will give a better review when the issue is resolved...
B0002HWQEE|2.0|I am very disappointed in this toy. Good grief it is tiny. I guess I should have paid more attention to the dimensions listed. This thing is too small for anything but a baby. I'm pretty sure my toddler grandson will smash this in no time. Be warned it is not worth the price. Way too small in my opinion, the picture is deceptive.
B008C20TDG|3.0|Hartwig makes some good points, but some of the legitimacy of what she seems questionable in my opinion, i.e. I've never heard of anybody who ate kind of &#34;healthy&#34; by her definition and still developed heart disease and diabetes. The first half of the book was interesting while the second half was hard to keep my attention going.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Such an incredible book series WITH SUCH A HORRIBLE ENDING!!!!!!! WHAT WERE YOU THINKING VERONICA???? SIX DAYS OF MY LIFE WASTED!
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I absolutely loved this season.  The ending was totally not as expected.  Can't wait for the next season to come out on DVD.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Awesome movie, I read the book first and I think the movie followed along well. I'm glad they tried to censer as much of the violence as possible to provide for a younger audience. Jennifer Lawrence is such a good actress, she makes the movie!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I check the weather every morning before I get dressed for work.  This app keeps me informed about upcoming weather issues in my area.
B000VBIGD6|1.0|Finally got the chance to sit down and watch the entire movie.I would catch bits and pieces of it when it's on tv every Christmas.Not interesting then,not interesting now.Not even remotely funny.It is rated PG-13 but it's a Chevy Chase movie,what do you expect?Offensive language(F-word,s***,G--D---it) and inappropriate scenes(female store/mall worker).I  don't get the humor/hype but to each his/her own.Like one of the reviewers said,don't bash people who didn't like the movie,make your own review.You want a real Christmas movie,watch The Nativity Story starring Keisha Castle-Hughes.Jingle All The Way(Arnold Schwarzenegger)is a cute movie and one of my favorites.The Santa Claus trilogy(Tim Allen) is another favorite in my household.You want drama try Mrs.Miracle or The Christnmas Shoes.Noticed how people are giving this one star all because of picture quality instead of reviewing the movie itself.
B00GH4RKYM|2.0|The Return of Superman was much better.<br />Even the 1978 version with Christopher Reeve at the helm in the title.
B004GYY714|5.0|Great App! Opens the airwaves again. No more dealing with the stations that overpower the station you really want to listen to.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was a quick and easy read at a time I did not want to get involved with a &#34;heavy&#34; book.  Interestingly, enough the book stimulated long and interesting discussion at my book club. The book was well-written with a storyline that is relevant in terms of living with the consequences of our actions every day.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|This book shows us the future....<br /><br />Do we really want to go there??  I think not, but see no way to stop.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I think its a cool game. but think it crazy to have to get help to cross over to the next phase. but love this game .
B003K15IF8|5.0|I just finished reading Stoner and found it a real joy to read.  I thought the author did a great job of developing the character of Stoner.  In the first part of the book I thought Stoner was a loser who just let life happen to him, but as the story developed I saw that Stoner was a man who had convictions and feelings, but he was a plodder.  In the end I somewhat admired him because in spite of all the obstacles he faced from his wife, and from the college administration and the head of the English Department, he continued to do his best as a teacher.  I am surprised this book has not been more popular.
B001V7SME2|5.0|Great movie! A new twist to the traditional vampire story. Very well directed.  The setting and cast is perfect. Highly recommended.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|Sure it works but some reason it refuses to actually load up a video and let me see the video
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Possibly one of the most unique fantasy books I've read in a while. Definitely gives the genre a breath of fresh air. A bit slow at times, but I attribute that more to the complex world Sanderson has created (which requires a lot of explaining) than to poor writing. Looking forward to digging into the next one of the series.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|This flash works great. It is easy to use and has more features than I will probably ever use. I had a less expensive flash but was not happy with the photo results. This one did not disappoint.
0399255370|5.0|Adorable book. Fun for adults to read. My 3 year old loves it and so do I. It will be a book we can read for many years.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|Excellent movie. Whoever did the synopsis named the narrator as Jack. Actually his name is never revealed. Watch this classic movie!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Let yourself into this world... It changes you.  The narrator was simply amazing and captured me entirely. I will think of him always now...
B00B2166BS|5.0|Have had this item for close to a year now and it works very well.  Charging is noticeably faster than the standard microUSB cable, well worth it!  Doesn't come with the actual plug in portion, but you don't really need it, since you'll never need to use your stock cable again!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great! I play with my five year old grandson and my three year old granddaughter. We take turns playing for hour.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|mindless video games I hate them.Takes away time that kids and adults should be spend outside.have a nice day inside.
B00GP0G0IK|4.0|Pretty good game. Good story line but a little confusing at times.  But over I really enjoyed the game and will look for more like this.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|mindless video games I hate them.Takes away time that kids and adults should be spend outside.have a nice day inside.
B00F2362IE|3.0|When my 9-year-old tries to use Turtle Time the game quits and he lands back on the home page of our Kindle Fire, otherwise he loves this game.
B00GX59QO2|5.0|Love the cast.  So much fun.  I get a little tired of all the &#34;pretty faces&#34; these days.  Give me character every time.  Beauty faids, character grows.
0307730700|5.0|Fearless is one of the most inspirational books I have read in a long time.  It's the story of a man who struggles with addiction, who overcomes to do some of the most heroic and amazing things for his family and this country.<br /><br />His struggle with addiction is very real and not sugar coated.  He wrestles with abusing drugs from the moment he becomes an addict.  Fortunately, he finds more to live for, and he discovers purpose for his life.<br /><br />Get a copy of this book - it will be hard to put down!<br /><br />I reviewed a copy of this book, and the opinions expressed are mine alone.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I thought this game was a kids game but was I wrong.<br />This game takes a lot of skill and I love the characters roles.
B004AFFZNI|5.0|makes recording sound a lot cleaner  and clear. EZ to mount on my home made go pro stick. I would buy it again
B00C5R7B0I|3.0|Maybe it's because I read the book at night before bed over the course of a week, but I found this one interesting at first then more tedious at the end when all of the story threads were finally woven together to reach the conclusion. One thing I will say though, it must be tough for these characters to go from the high drama of solving complicated serial murder cases to the rather pedestrian family holiday meal.<br />Would I recommend this one?  Cornwell remains one of my favorite authors, but I don't think I'd recommend this one - no.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Taylor Swift, enough said! Always a pleasure to listen to and enjoy! If you like country music you will like this CD!
B00ET9T2WK|2.0|I love the idea of this game on my kindle, but it boots me all the time. Far better on my phone
B00CL1SR7O|4.0|This was a Christmas present, so I can't rate the music, however I am sure the recipient will not be disappointed.  I was surprised as to the bonus of the free cloud download. Nice addition to my music library.  Thanks Amazon, you never fail to provide excellent service and fast shipping.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|my 4 year old grandson MAX loves this game....,. he has no trouble with the hunts; but he has been using kindle and xbox since he was 2 years old.......
0316322407|5.0|What an inspiration! It is a shame how a young woman's courage demonstrates to adults what is truly important in life. This should be REQUIRED reading for every world leader. Thanks Amazon for making this story available.
B00G91Z8AQ|5.0|Such a good movie. The back story scattered throughout the movie gave it meaning. The fights were epic, on a scale fitting only Superman. I loved this movie.
1401938906|5.0|Excellent read. I've never been much of one to read books, but the law of attraction is something I recently discovered. I ran across this book and thought, &#34;that sounds interesting.&#34; I ordered it on my Kindle and read it in a few short days. I know it takes longer to actually do the experiments, but I thought I'd give it a once through, doing a few of the experiments while going along. I believe it works, and am reading it a second time at a slower pace to properly absorb and fully do each experiment. Reading this felt like something my best friend wrote. I wasn't bored at all. In fact, I could hardly put it down.
B00B5HQLMI|1.0|Bad.  Realism has to be suspended when watching this movie.  Falls that would kill don't, shots that would kill don't and on and on.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|It is a lovely adventure novel, a fantasy adventure that I might like to have in my 90's and beyond.
B00DMK6WN4|5.0|This is such a cute move.  Everybody that watched it with us just sat there and giggled and had such a good time.  Thank you.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|It allows me to look up all the new words that the Scrabble app plays against me.  I still don't think some of them are words.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I don't think I have ever heard a story about Nazi Germany from the perspective of an average German living in a little German town.  Not all Germans supportd Hitler.  The little book thief and her foster family were caring and wanted to do what was right.  A very sad time in history.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Terrible interaction on the web - every time I try to connect it goes to &#34;Thai&#34; language page.  I can only connect via my phone.  Asks for verification of everything. Poor docmentation.
B00899F0G8|5.0|Pretty Little Liars is so addictive and has been from the first show.  This season has revealed much and also brought up many more questions.  We are looking forward to the new Spinoff starting in January.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I love these guys! Great album with nice album work.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Great music<br />Great album case<br /><br />Cons:<br />none that I can see.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Had to get the beginning to go see the latest release.  Wasn't sure I would like it, but it was great, really got me interested.
159463176X|1.0|Did not care for this one I am tired of febles and is getting old I would chose a different style of writing than continuing on the same way.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|The game is pretty awesome. It's the same as the Xbox live edition, but cheaper and portable. The only downside is that the world is smaller than the Xbox edition. Other than that, it's great. Worth 4.99
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Great book, from beginning to end. Made for several late nights. Can't wait for the next book in the series, can't come fast enough.
B000MZHW40|4.0|I usually do not like Leonardo Dicaprio as an actor, but he played this role well.  It is another good history lesson of the diamond trade in Sierra Leone.  What is still happening today and what you think about how a simple gift causes so much pain in many areas of the world.<br /><br />Nothing is free or cheap when you think of human suffering as shown in this film.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|Great movie!  It captured the attention of both our 3 year old son and 6 year old daughter for the entire movie.  Plus even my husband and I laughed and enjoyed it.  I would definitely recommend this movie.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Once the ACA is in place, this will be looked on as a primer for what could and should happen in the US.  The US is so far behind much of the industrialized countries when it comes to health care.  Greed is definitely a major factor in our decline.
B00DXPC1U6|1.0|Dexter was a long running and mostly good show, until this bummer of a final season.  They had their stumbles and problems along the way, (some hate season 6, some hate season 3) but I followed along with the show, trusting that the writers knew what they were doing, and for seven years I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />Season 8 changed everything, and they have no excuse.  The writers knew this season was going to be the last 2 years in advance.  So before they started production on Season 7, they knew they had two seasons to tie everything up, and after a pretty good build up in season 7, I was expecting season 8 to knock it out of the park, but it failed on every level.<br /><br />Each season through 7 had a loose theme, such as &#34;parenthood,&#34; &#34;faith,&#34; &#34;friendship,&#34; etc, and Season 8 tries to do something with the theme of &#34;family,&#34; I suppose, but this theme has already been exhausted after seven seasons, so there wasn't really much left to explore.  Side characters get subplots that last for episodes that end of going literally nowhere (CS Lee and his agent should be pissed as hell) other plots and guest stars that appear for a few episodes and disappear and reappear as if at random, and for no discernible reasonthe major mystery/villain is an afterthought and boring, and the ending is...abysmal.  The most brain-dead monkeys clacking on typewriters for thirty minutes would have been able to come up with something more plausible and more true to the characters than what these jokers wrote.<br /><br />Honestly, I feel terrible for Michael C. Hall, and really all the actors, who worked hard for eight years to be rewarded with this crap.  They deserved better.<br />Much had been made about the last episode, but let me be clear.  Every episode is wretched.  Even the early ones that are bearable are soon ruined by the plotting that comes next.  I honestly got to the point where I just didn't want to watch anymore because I just knew the next episode was going to be worse.<br /><br /> Please don't waste your money.  The end of season 7 is a much better finale than this dreck.  It may have even ruined the brilliant early seasons for me.next episode was going to be worse.<br /><br /> Please don't waste your money.  The end of season 7 is a much better finale than this dreck.  It may have even ruined the brilliant early seasons for me.
B001GZ6QBU|4.0|Great flick.  Although Bale is good again in this episode, Heath Ledger was phenomenal.  It was sad to hear that he took his life.  Ledger had a promising and great career ahead of him.<br /><br />Definitely worth the purchase due to the acting, writing and directing.
B002JVWR0Y|5.0|The stand out of the entire series.  John Lithgow is perfect, and the whole season manages to balance the philosophical underpinnings of psychopathy with human nature and fun vigilante thriller action.  Plus, you know there's that thing that happens.
B00005U122|3.0|Good music. The Wall was better, but this music compilation was more interesting when it comes to the Pink Floyd group.  I think Roger did a good job in the order of the music.  Nothing original except for the orchestration.
B000URWYTS|5.0|This gave a very intimate view of a great architect.  His relationship with a woman he could not make his wife is well told.  The manner in which FLW went about his work and how he viewed everything is fascinating.  The ending is rather shocking too.  He does live a long life.  There are also interesting looks at the Women's Movement in it's infancy.  A most satisfactory read!
B002RSDW80|3.0|My wife enjoys this more then I do.  The characters and acting are very good but the story line is not my type.  But I would recommend you see the movie even if you don't think buying the DVD is worth it.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Fun and exciting you can't put it down. Going back and forth gives you a lot of ideas. It's great for the entire family to play.
B000AU9UYC|4.0|This was a good purchase.  I have watch this DVD about 3 times.  I think Bale plays the comic hero the best.  I enjoyed the story better then previous versions/adaptations.  It was well directed with a good plot.  Not the top of my list but still a good few years on the shelf.
1401324649|5.0|I READ IT BEFORE IN GERMAN THEN AGAIN IN ENGLISH AND I MUST SAY IT IS GREAT IN EITHER LANGUAGE.AND I CAN<br />NOT WAIT TO READ HIS NEXT BOOK
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|This is the greatest Pixar movie made.  The creativity is exceptional.  It is fun to watch and great for any age.  I can't recall all the times I say the word &#34;squirrel&#34; just for a joke.  I continue to hope Pixar creates movies like these.
B007C9N4H8|3.0|A cute, forgettable Muppets caper. Not &#34;The Muppet Movie&#34; by any stretch but certainly watchable. Some of the songs really stay in your head. The plot does not, and the Muppet &#34;star&#34; isn't anywhere near as interesting as most of his puppety colleagues.
0684833395|2.0|Should have waited until the local library had this book available to read.  I read it in HS but thought I should read it again in later life.  Did not appreciate it the second time and was a waste of money.
0307913090|5.0|It's a gift so I haven't actually listened to it to see if I like the reader, but it arrived promptly and in perfect condition!
B005IQZB14|4.0|I enjoyed her  need to excel at something. Her ability to stick to her challenge even though she would have some challenages that she had not counted on. Her honesty regarding her feet and the shoes. Her lack of money but the grit she had to make her goal these were all the things that made her a shero.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|So far it seems to be working just fine. I downloaded it so I would feel more secure that my kindle fire is free of any little threats.
B008JFUP0I|5.0|Fast and furious 6 is the best movie ever!!!!!! Don't rent it. BUY IT!!!!!! It's the best out of the series and of all time. You will NOT regret it at all. It has so much explosive action that pops right out at your face! Great plot. Great story. GREAT movie!!!!! I've pre ordered it already. It is so awesome!!! It is my favorite movie.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|great actors,  great story,  well placed,  nice change of scenery.  A great way to extend the DIE HARD series.  :)
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It's excellent, easy viewing from a number of devices. Hoping for a few more features in the future, but for now it's a cheap and effective way to put content on the big screen.
B00EL8JCGU|3.0|it was good acting and a great story line but for the length of the movie I was hoping for more action
B003YL4LYI|3.0|On the whole this book is enjoyable, but it's definitely lacking in the excitement of the first three novels. Some of the chapters seem to drag on and on, but Martin always manages to recapture my attention and imagination. I do hope the next novel in this series isn't as drawn out as this book and the previous one.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The basic theme of the book is thought provoking, which makes it worthwhile as more than a simple story.  However, I  found the plot too dependent on coincidences to be realistic.  The Epilogue is interesting as it addresses the many &#34;what-if's&#34; and unknown factors that often confront us when we must make important decisions.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is beautifully written about a time that is difficult to fully comprehend.  The point of view of a German family living during the Nazi regime was different from any that I had read before.  I highly recommend this book.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Really fun and addicting :)it's really easy to use. Fun for everyone. Works great for kindle fire. Amazing game need to buy :)
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie can't wait to see the next one in the movie the theater  loved the special effects and the plot
B008JFUPK8|2.0|But I could barely watch it. Only a few cool scenes, mostly just standard action movie stuff with Superman showing up now and then. Such a wasted opportunity to do something really great with this stale character. This is not Batman Begins or The Dark Knight quality. It's crap. Two stars for some of the cool action. Wish there was a good story and some actual characters to go with it.
0307165485|5.0|I purchased these as gifts. When my children were small, each had their favorite stories in this book which we would read again and again. The illustrations are a treat.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|First one seemed to have some connectors that were too tight and too loose -- the distributor (AnkerDirect) expressed some concern and offered a replacement.  The new one seems to be an improvement.
B00DJ4PIBK|4.0|this product needs to say that the whole box is important - it is not just packaging. it is the calendar.
B008602KQI|5.0|Loved it.  True to book.  Read the trilogy.  It's a must read.  Catnus is the up expecting heroine in the story
1451666179|5.0|She is a brilliant writer and love her humour. Have been following the blog for years. Allie has a very dark sarcastic approach to writing which makes the book very entertaining for me at least
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Have read most of Grisham's books and this one is another of the same quality as previous works. Grisham is not as prolific as some authors but that really works in his favor.<br />Sycamore Row gets a little bogged down, in the middle, but stay with it and you will see how it all ties together.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|Great set and a cheap way to get all the HP movies. It looks like random extra discs were used to fill this set (i.e. they don't match and one disc lacks a cover picture all together), so if you are looking for a timeless, beautiful display set, this is not it. Serves its purpose for me, though.
B001GKJ2FW|3.0|My family likes the movie but we did not get the digital copy. We were sent the movie + sound track. We ordered the movie + digital copy but we did not get the digital copy. We got the movie + sound track. WE ORDERED THE MOVIE + DIGITAL COPY. WE RECEIVED THE MOVIE + SOUND TRACK. WE DID NOT GET THE MOVIE + DIGITAL COPY.<br />I guess I can't rate the digital copy. We didn't get the digital copy. We got the sound track. We ordered the digital copy.<br />The sound track might be ok, I don't know, I haven't listened to it. I imagine it's the songs you hear in the movie.
0525953728|5.0|A real account of what it must have been like to take part in the anhilation of Osama bin Laden. Chilling in some respect, yet so very real and heart-wrenching.  My God, these Seals are larger than life!!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book is the book that finally converted me from a &#34;paper book&#34; to the Kindle. I have tried for 3 years and just could never enjoy the book without holding it in my hand. This should say something about &#34;The Kitchen House.&#34; Some have complained of a repetitive nature in the book. I disagree, and instead, found myself looking forward to two different people's perspective on the same incident. This is a fast moving novel about an Irish girl who, on her way from Ireland, loses her entire family. She is picked up by a plantation owner who brings her back to the plantation where she lives between two worlds...that of the slaves in the &#34;kitchen house&#34; and the white family in &#34;the big house.&#34; It is interesting to see that to a child, so young and impressionable, that color means little to one's heart. The novel is fast paced, emotionally intriguing and certainly worth the read.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Over all this app is good but sometimes it won't let you log on or go to the next level.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Life of Pi  This is the best movie I've seen in years.  I watched it 3 times. Its the kind of adventure and fantasy I love to watch. I just wish that Tiger would have look back for Pi as he went into the jungle.  Very sad.

B008K6HN8I|2.0|I liked this app a lot when I first installed it, and it lived on my Kindle Fire quite happily for about a month. But a short time ago, my virus checking app reported that it contained a virus, so I removed it. I tried to confirm a virus presence using an internet search, but all I could find is that this app is a Chinese product and that it has a malware package that is causing problems in China at this time. Basically, it supposedly makes unauthorized purchases online.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love this app. I don't have to have an ugly clock near my bed and I can take it with me where ever I go.
0385486804|4.0|I bought this book for my daughter to read in her English class.I got a great deal and the book was in great condition looked very good very gently used.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This book was recommended to me so I read it.  I was baffled by the name of the book but decided to give it a try.  I really ended up enjoying this book.  It was mysterious and whimsical.  I loved the characters and it was very smartly written.  Fun read that made me smile alot and I learned a lot.
0062107313|4.0|I loved Amy Tan's earlier works, but I was less enthralled with some of her later efforts.  I thought that she needed to get away from her mother-daughter themes.  When I saw her latest, The Valley of Amazement, I thought that I'd give it a try.  I found it enjoyable although with a few issues here and there.<br /><br />It is early in the 1900s and Lulu Minturn runs a first class courtesan house in Shanghai.  This American-transplant is an astute businesswoman and fairly well off.  She is raising her young daughter, Violet, in the courtesan house.  Violet is a head-strong girl who thinks that she is better than those who work for her mother.  But her world is shattered when she discovers that her father was actually Chinese.  The changing political framework in China has made it difficult for foreigners, and Lulu decides to return to the states.  But an unscrupulous man tricks Lulu and steals Violet and sells her to a courtesan house.  Without giving away too much of the plot, let me just say that Violet's life and experiences start to mimic those of her mother and Violet does what she needs to survive.<br /><br />I was enchanted with the descriptions of the courtesan houses in China.  They were more than just brothels and years of training went into educating the women who worked as courtesans.  I also enjoyed reading how the Boxer Rebellion impacted both Chinese and foreigners alike.  And Amy Tan eloquently writes about dealing with being half-Chinese and half-American.  \\"No matter what I did, I feared the stranger-father within my blood.  Would his character also emerge and make me even more Chinese?  And if that came to pass, where would I belong?  What would I be allowed to do?  Would anyone love a half-hated girl?\\"  Unfortunately, I found that The Valley of Amazement was too long and drawn-out in many spots, making this story longer than it needed to be.  Also, I found that the plot was rather implausible in many spots.  For an educated woman, Lulu turns out to be pretty short-sighted in protecting herself against a con.  The same goes for Violet.<br /><br />Still, The Valley of Amazement will take the reader to another world and another time, which is something that I always enjoy when reading.  Overall, I think it worthy of four stars.o be pretty short-sighted in protecting herself against a con.  The same goes for Violet.<br /><br />Still, The Valley of Amazement will take the reader to another world and another time, which is something that I always enjoy when reading.  Overall, I think it worthy of four stars.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|The whole story seemed totally implausible that he was the only one who could land the plane having been a drunk most of his life and the fact that he was drunk the night before and the day of the flight.<br />The ending was so forced and moralistic.  The best part of the whole movie was John Goodman's drug dealing character.<br /><br />It was free for me because I have Amazon Prime but I wouldn't have paid for it.
B0084AYLK8|5.0|I couldn't put the book down till i finished reading it! A very special relationship between two male characters , Henchard and Farfrae , is in the center of the story and it is hard not to relate to it..
B000I9YLWG|5.0|Still as creepy as ever and Fun to watch even though we all know how it ends and what happens in the middle. Tony Perkins was cheated out of an Oscar nomination.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|People who complete this in an hour or two must be either very very good at puzzles or more likely constantly hit the clue button. it is a great game and I can happily recommend it to anyone. works fine on kindle fire.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Fun game but very frustrating since you only get 5 lives per day to start.  Once you use those 5 lives,  you have to wait at least 30 minutes for one more life, so it is the game you want to play for hours, but can't, unless of course you buy lives at $.99 for 5.
159102594X|3.0|Starts off slow and feels like a grind but after about 60-80 pages it starts to pick up and get interesting. There certainly is a feeling that not much happens in the book and that there's a lot of build up with little payoff. That said, there are certainly many worse fantasy books out there and while the writing isn't entirely my cup of tea, there's no denying it's good enough.<br /><br />The Blade Itself is arranged by several different character PoVs similar to something like A Song of Ice and Fire. I, personally, am not a fan of this style of writing; it destroys suspense at many points when you start getting interested in something it just sort of ends in a cliffhanger while some other character trudges on with something mundane. It also takes a really, really long time for some of the characters to really shine. Logen Ninefingers, for example, is called the Bloody Nine, but the significance of this isn't shown till the LAST Logen chapter in the book.<br /><br />One saving grace for the character design is that all of the characters have significant flaws and none of them are without some counter-balancing feature. Sometimes the author relies on fairly banal tropes when employing this but for the most part things are interesting.
B005ERIRZE|5.0|had to really think about what I was reading and how it applied to me.  Author suggests you read a chapter a week and apply it, got impatient and had to go back and do as author suggested.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is an excellent game.  I have not seen any glitches.  Kudos to you programmers that made this game.  I have been playing this for months and I always come back to it after playing the new games because this one is so much fun.
B003F1WM2K|5.0|Patti Smith was able to convey the atmosphere and spirit of the times without sinking into &#34;good old days&#34; nostalgia and sappiness.  Reading this book was like hanging out for a weekend with an interesting artsy friend.
B008B8AOQI|5.0|This music toughed me so deeply, would recommend it highly. Everyone should at least sit with a good drink in hand and listen.

B005LAIIJY|5.0|This was a gift.  The really enjoyed the movie.  Thank you for having it in stock.  I would recommend for someone who is into horror.  Very bloody.
B004GYY714|4.0|Nice app, but it would be nice if you could tag favorite podcasts as well as favorite stations.  This is a small matter, because the app is fine.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This was a great game.  My husband and I loved it.  Haven't been able to find a game like it.

B000A0GYD2|5.0|The definitive book on Man's greatest achievement; ranks with The Right Stuff as superior movies of that genre only this was more space and less acting.

0345529057|5.0|Excellent series for fantasy fans. Even better on the second reading. Fun to see how the television series differs.     For the love of the Seven, no one ask George Martin when the next book is coming out. He swears he will kill a Stark every time it happens.    Highly recommend. Thumbs up from this reviewer.    Product as described. Fast and easy transaction. Good price.
0399161287|5.0|This is one of the most moving autobiographies I have read in a long time.<br />A page turner from beginning to end, from lows to high then lows to highs, a rollercoaster ride for both Tyson and his reader. One cannot escape the pain of his journey, and his struggles to reach maturity.<br />Heart warming and motivating, this goes on my shelves as a must-read. Tyson has proved himself a hero both inside and outside the ring, and will outlive his detractors.
B001EO748M|5.0|Product as described. Fast and easy transaction. Good price.<br /><br />Excellent production values. An interesting story retold.<br /><br />Highly recommend. Thumbs up from this reviewer.
0736092269|5.0|This book has changed my life. I would recommend it to anyone who is tired of their gym routines and is not seeing results. It really helped me to diversify my workouts.
0262731541|4.0|Very technical book.  I was looking for something a little less scientific but as I started reading it was rather interesting.  A lot of it did go over my head though and reminded me of a college text book more that a coffeetable book, which I suppose is to be expected as its an MIT publication.
006202406X|1.0|*NO SPOILERS*<br />I read the first and second book, and was excited for the third. I read the reviews and everyone said it was horrible and not to read it. I didn't listen and read anyways.It was an amazing book I didn't know what everyone was talking about, until the last 7 chapters.  The author completely ruined the ending!  I would NOT have read the books if I knew it ended in a horrible way! I say save your tears for a better book. DON'T READ THE BOOK UNLESS YOU WANT TO CRY FOR DAYS AND FEEL DEAD INSIDE!
B00AFROVQC|1.0|This is probably one of the worst written books I've read in a while. I can't even finish it because I find myself shaking my head or getting bored halfway through a sentence. It uses a lot of worn out fantasy tropes; the outcast son, who also happens to have special powers, who is also the chosen one mentioned in prophecy, who gets adopted by the king, who falls in love with a princess, etc. This reads like something written by a high school student, and the story shares the same level of maturity. A lot of things happen in the story with no plausible explanation, or something amazing happens and nobody pays attention.<br /><br />I honestly don't know why this has so many high reviews, but it sucked me into buying it. It's like these 4-5 star reviewers have never read any of the great fantasy authors that this book borrows so heavily from.
160774273X|5.0|THIS IS A MUST HAVE IN YOUR KITCHEN IF YOU ARE A BAKER!!! Every time i pick it up with the intention of baking, another lesson finds its way into my view. This book is more than just being able to make great, its the bakers lifebook for desiring the correct ingredients from Flour, Water, Salt, and Yeast, as there is so much more to the science of baking. I felt the need to order it as I wanted to become educated on the science.. Ken Forkish tells all the trials and tribulations, and is very common ground with his explainations. I would post a picture of my breads, however I cannot seem to find a way to do so here... unfortunatley!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Fantastic game with lots of details to remember and piece together. Lots of separate mini games and hidden objects to solve
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I did not think this was my kind of book being over 70 years old, but I was so taken that I read the other two books when they came out.  Hope to see the movies.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Good book. Can't wait to read \\"The House of Hades\\"<br />Rick Riordan is a good author for teenagers and young adults.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Loved the book and the pickup where A Time to Kill left off.  One of Grisham's better later books. Would definitely recommend.
B007N85POS|5.0|My daughter started playing it first and said it was the best, most entertaining one yet. Love the birds, etc.!
B004N6369Y|5.0|Very good book and enjoyed very much. Ms. Steele rarely lets you down - she didn't on this one. Thanks
B005VPRDAY|5.0|great GIFT, MY 6 YEAR OLD PLAYED WITH THESE FOR HOURS~ AS A MATTER OF FACT OUR WHOLE FAMILY HAD FUN WITH THEM
B00EGMHKBA|3.0|Not up to Mr Eggers usual high standards for writing, unfortunately - but loved the big concept and the proximity to reality.  Characters seemed a bit shallow and the story &#34;elementary&#34;, but will be giving it as a gift to a woman very near the same age as the protagonist to provide a different angle on the brave new world of social media....
B005VPRETE|5.0|GREAT CONDITION, PACKAGING WAS PERFECT,  VERY FUN ACTIVITY TO DO WITH MY CHILD! GOOD TOY TO HELP WITH SMALL MOTOR SKILLS
B00BAXFECK|3.0|Some absolutely brilliant writing, particularly in the first and last third of the novel - the middle was perhaps not so eloquent and beautiful, likely due more to the lead character's circumstances.  Frustrating at times in the amount of time spent on certain aspects of the story, but compelling and thoughtful stuff nonetheless.
B00FG1Q5J8|4.0|Great game lots of fun just wish it was longer.  It was a really quick game but lots of fun.  Would give it five stars if there was more levels or the ability to have bigger ships.
0316069906|5.0|Excellent book to know what you eat and feed your family.<br />Pluralism of opinion is part of the writing. Read, and then make your own opinion.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham is a &#34;story telling genius&#34;. The characters are straight out of the Deep South. The plot builds beautiful towards an amazing conclusion.
0767836324|5.0|Who doesn't love totally solid movies from their childhood?  I cannot wait to watch this with my son.  He loved Goonies so much that I'm now gathering up all of my favorites for him!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|If the author does not bring back Jo snow I will delete all these books. Just when I think all is going well VARYS comes back
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Ico was one of the most engaging and immersive games of its time, despite its lack of popularity. Still, its haunting design and groundbreaking system of having to take care of a companion that couldn't do anything without you has made it an enduring classic. Now in its updated glory, it's a game worth buying even for those who have fond memories of the original.
B0081336FO|5.0|This updated Sherlock still carries the brilliance of the original without trying to be hip. Cumberbatch is so good at the &#34;all in one breath&#34; rapid fire analysis of the situation that it forces you to pay close attention to every detail. Can't wait for the next season!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Fun game. However, I wish it was not so expensive to buy more crowns. I would recommend this game if you like completing quest and building cities, or in this case rebuilding a kingdom.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Extraordinary.  First few chapters, I thought it was a young adult novel, then it turned more and more complex. It is a compelling story that makes you rethink the very concepts of 'right', 'wrong', 'good', 'bad'.
B00FGFVMGA|4.0|Good puzzle-keeps me guessing. I like the help feature as it assisted me in getting past one or two of the tasks. Without the hints, I would be stuck because the answers given to me made no sense! I like these types of games. Keeps me thinking.
1476727651|5.0|Having read The Shining and a few others of Stephen King's works, I found Doctor Sleep, not scary, but certainly thrilling and suspenseful. Having read this book in 5 days, I was unable to put this book down until shocked or when tears had filled my eyes. When I had finished The Shining, I was stuck with the question of Danny Torrance and his mother, Wendy; Doctor Sleep certainly answered that and did way more then expected. Wonderful piece of work, and certainly worthy of being placed on a bookshelf next to its' predecessor.<br /><br />This book made my muscles grow tense, made me lean further, and even made me put it down for a few minutes just out of shock. Danny certainly has overcome his fears, and came out so much better than before.
B009PAETCG|4.0|Overall it is an ok game. My son who is almost 4 plays this which is why I downlaoded it. He can play it ok but sometimes the game has glitches and won't open or stops working in the middle of playing not sure why. We have to stop and reset the game but then it comes back on without any issues. Overall it is alright but i think i would look for something else that is like this but maybe more kid friendly, which is my fault for not doing the research.
B00BMKH5NW|4.0|I actually came upon this book because my friend suggested I read it because I have a huge obsession with the boyband One Direction. I literally eat sleep and breathe them everyday by tweeting about them, making vines about them, photoshopping myself into pictures with them and reading/writing fanfics. So back to the book-I found myself relating to every page. I love how Cath's fanfiction brought her closer to Levi. The story was very charming and cute.<br />-Emma,14, CA
B00AESN8XY|5.0|It's a fun game and you tend to get really into killing the world haha. I haven't had any problems with the game and enjoy playing it every once in a while.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a great read and a good start to the trilogy.  If you are looking for an easy ready without having to put too much thought, this is a great book!
B00F1W1SQW|5.0|Best band ever! I absolutely recommended it! Great sound excelent great quality! Featuring songs fron dramatic turn of events and some from older albums.
0307476073|5.0|this is a courageous memoir.  Cheryl writes honestly about her life and the way the journey through the Pacific Crest trail helped her recapture her true self. I applaud this writer.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Awesome Book!  I have to seen the movie yet.  However every time I have seen a movie based on a book it always better to read the book first.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Used in my Kindle...great...because most of the document you can read it only with .!!!..want to used in my iPad soon!!!
B007MC8YLQ|2.0|1) Flurry analytics for a card game? Really?<br />2) Why do I need to give all personal information stored on my phone for a freaking card game? There's no sense in it I tell you.<br />3) A great card game is 24-7 Solitaire series with Freecell built in, or just break out a deck and play [then no one knows or invades your space].<br />**It could have been great- all other permissions are not invasive
B008JFUP0I|5.0|RIP Paul Walker!!  No one could possibly replace you if there should be a Fast and Furious 7!  Truly a sad day in Hollywood!
B0013FSXSC|5.0|One of the best King Arthur movies we ever saw.  The acting is very good believable and enjoyable, romantic, a real hero. I watch it all the time with my husband. I's a winner! Must have it for Christmas.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|Do love all the songs in this album. It´s fantastic. All the songs are wonderful, Definitively a must to all who likes Pearl Jam music.
B00A2H9PLG|5.0|I chose it for a Christmas gift for hubby. H loves the action in it and it's very real. Good entertainment and plot! Better than Olympus.<br />It may be a guy thing but the action keeps him out of trouble.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|I loved this game! Some of the other reviews were wanting instructions but I disagree. If you've ever played a game of this time, instructions would be completely pointless. Not to mention, there is a hint feature! My only complaint is that the game was too short. Great game overall.
B0080BFWE0|5.0|This movie reminds me of high school. The real losers and hero's. I laugh out loud every time I watch it. These two leading characters remind me of my best friend, Sandy who was killed in an auto accident. Her and I did a lot of these things and I will never forget it as long as I live. Please take the time to buy it and get ready to laugh! I have passed it on to my granddaughter!. She loves the 80's when these guys were football jocks and geeks were geeks! Buy it.
B008GGA5EQ|2.0|This book dragged on and on mainly because the author kept flashbacks coming . Way too many of the girls former life . I skipped over pages at a time. There were many hot sex scenes, whips, f/f,  but I cannot recommend this book. Also, the ending just plain sucked. After reading all that at least it should end better.
B001NVIZ3E|5.0|Greatest movie ever! Watched it 10 times. This is a movie for the people who love a good old fashion acting.
B004WR125O|5.0|Works right out of the box, set-up is simple. I just plugged it in, went to internet setup on the receiver and did a manual setup and typed in my wireless password. The standby feature is great because I can use my smart-phone which is connected to the Wi-Fi to control the receiver via the Onkio cell-phone App.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I love this game.  it is not boring but it isn't mind consuming either.  story line is cute and the puzzles are challenging.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|A  'Just Perfect' application for uploading and preserving photos, with fast accessibility from multiple devices (your computer, your iPhone, iPad, or Kindle). And best of all, I don't have to worry about photos disappearing from one album when I do something with another album, as too often happens with my phone's photo storage app.  If you have ever lost an entire album of online photos - and worst of all, if you thought you were deleting only the online copies but deleted the photos from  your computer - you know what true angst is. You WON'T experience that with THIS Amazon photo storage app. This app is simple and straightforward, and entirely reliable!
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Very cool game, this is the first game I have downloaded that I am hooked on. The graphics are really good and the sharks movements are really good. Very enjoyable. I would recommend it.
B000URDE2Y|4.0|Never heard of this before ,my honey heard it on his radio station and wanted it'''So now he has it we enjoy it''
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a wonderful series and I hate to even think of when they will end it.  Sit on the edge of your seat and hold your breath through the whole episode type good!
B004H7V6C8|4.0|This is a very cute idea...however its alot smaller than i thought. make sure you read the dimentions prior to purchasing. i bought it for my nephews they are 2 and 5 so  i think that it will still work...any older i would prob return it.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Continues the story of Danny from the Shining and shows what happened to him after the events in the Shining and how he coped. I enjoyed the book and the storyline and would recommend it to readers who are curious about Danny and who also like the works of King.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|Down loaded game to have something to do. Kept me thinking. Challenged by trying to figure game . Didn't read all directions usually like to figure things out on my own.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thankyou for finally making available on kindle. I. enjoy playing and the convienience of having it on my kindle and not just my phone. no problems. with crashes.
0385351399|5.0|This is not equivalent to 1984 - I would compare it to A Modest Proposal.  Contrasting the last scene, where Orwell shows a broken Winston Smith and saying something like &#34;the bullet had entered his brain.  He loved Big Brother&#34; with Mae still dissatisfied with the information she could not obtain IMO shows this point clearly.  The small elements - the endless surveying rendered meaningless by the search for a perfect score, the pseudo-Socratic method questioning riffing on the overused &#34;Does that make sense?&#34;, even the disconnect of Bay Area tech philosophy with the rest of Cali - all very well played.  By bringing all of these elements to their &#34;logical&#34; conclusion, Eggers has created an enjoyable satire, not a warning on the dangers of technology or privacy invasion
0061906220|5.0|My favorite character. My Kinders love him too! Can't go wrong with Pete the Cat. The repetitiveness is great for the students to connect to reading skills.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I really enjoyed this book it took me a few chapters to really get in to it but once I did I couldn't put it down I certainly would recommend it to everyone

B005D9MUWY|5.0|Way better than the stock keyboard for my gs3. Very responsiv.  Love how it learns or predicts your next word or phrase. Saves a lot of time.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|I love this app so much I get to race dirty and knock other competitors out of the competition literally... this app is awesome.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Enjoyable book! It became really intense toward the end making it difficult to put the book down. I recommend this to anyone.
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|This game is really good but the driving could be better.  Besides that this is the best game on kindle in my opinion.
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|Beautifully written. Poetic, poignant story woven around the tightrope walk between the Trade Center buildings. Worth reading slowly and rereading many phrases and pages. Wow does the worl spin.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I can't even get into the app without it saying it is not working right now I really do not like this app.
B00FEMJF6O|2.0|Crowns are way too expensive and only earn one or two at a time.when a character  costs 350 crowns you are going to spend some money.I reached level 18 and still didn't see anyway to earn more than 2 crowns at one time. I gave up.I'm not willing to invest that kind of money in a game.
B00GTZN0X4|5.0|Good family entertainment. Was fun to watch. Gets kids interested in airplanes and has a good message about sticking to things and seeing it through.
B005OYKI1I|3.0|It's a decent popcorn flick. Watch it for the action, not the story. The title sounds like a quick sexual act involving hands.
B00EGMQIJ0|1.0|I find it hard to believe that this book would have gotten any good press whatsoever if not for the Eggers name. The book was dull, predictable and obvious. It was unbelievable and lacked any subtlety. Avoid.
B00FVZJYK6|5.0|Fun Family Movie! The entire family watched this after Thanksgiving and it was perfect family movie - fun for adults and kids.
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|Good book.  If you have read all the others in the series this is a must.  Interesting and keeps your attention
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Excellent condition. Quick Shipping. Nice gift for my son since he looooves the mine craft video game! We also got the other 3 sets by Lego. Very Very Nice!
B008LXZFH6|1.0|Absolutely terrible, unfunny, and idiotic. Please, Amazon, give us a chance to give zero stars when it is warranted.<br /><br />When Jack Black, one more talentless \\"actor\\", kicks the dog over the bridge into the water, we decided to not torture ourselves further. There is no hope for our society if scenes like that are supposed to be funny. The sexual innuendo and outright obvious sexual \\"jokes\\", like an erection in the newsroom that is paraded around ad nauseum, makes this appropriate for stoned college boys and anyone who finds the Jackass movies entertaining. The fact that many 5-star reviews talk about how much their kids loved it shows once again the sorry state of parenting in America.<br /><br />Sorry, Will. I loved you in Elf, a charming movie, but you are no Bill Murray.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|My seven year old loves this movie, the cast is fun and energetic.  The DVD is perfect and came quickly.  Thank you for a wonderful purchase!

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Oh Candy Crush. Why oh why must you be so addicting.  If I were to give advice about Candy Crush, it would be the same advice I got before playing.  DON'T DO IT!!! However, I didn't listen and I'm glad I didn't.  I love the mind stretching game to it's faults.  I hate Chocolate and Licorice and I love Chocolate covered candy bombs switched with striped candies.. those are the best.  Be forewarned, it's super, highly addictive.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It is a wonder action book. You could read out everyday. Don't forget what happens because there is a movie.

B0015DYIH2|3.0|first half of book is boring. it picks up second half. i wont read it again but if you can get through the first half its much better
B00ESY77LO|5.0|This is a beautiful movie. Leo does an amazing job as always, and the movie truly portrays what the book instilled in me many years ago when I read it for the first time. Very well done! Rented via amazon prime and it came through perfectly clear, too
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|I love terraria and when my laptop died my folder died. When I heard about it being on the kindle I wanted to cry. It's the best. It's not at 1.2 but it gives it nostalgia. What else can I say except BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT. STOP READING THIS AND BUY IT WHY ARE YOU STILL STANDING AROUND BUY IT. BUY IT BEFORE I TURN INTO THE WALL OF FLESH AND EAT YOU.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Bravo Neil Bauman. You understand children, adults and the universe as no other. To read your work is to leave this earth.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love the Pinterest app. Because I don't have to get on it on my computer. I can get on it on my Kindle Fire instead. I don't have to carry around my computer, just my Kindle Fire.
B0042MEQVG|1.0|Terrible movie. acting, storyline...blah.  special effects good. everyone said the books were better.  Read those instead of wasting your time here.
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|I love this game! It's so much fun, it's like GTA, you kill people, you buy cool weapons and vehicles, you can even fly jets :D. The story line is really fun to follow. You can race, you can go into casinos, you can party in the night club (can't dance though, one downer), drive through the city, shoot up gangsters, and lots of other stuff, I haven't gotten that far into it but I can tell its gonna get even better, I HIGHLY recommend this game. However as a fare warning, this app takes a TON of space on your device so make sure you have enough room, I had to delete almost everything off my Kindle Fire just to get this app, but omg it's worth it. Enjoy!! :D
1579128149|5.0|As a professional PhD chemist, I have found this to be the best book about the elements &#34;as they really are&#34;.  Pictures of what they are used for, pictures of the pure elements,  along with the scientific data on each entry makes the book a bedtime or coffee table read as well as a reference text.  I have purchased 8+ copies and used them as presents.
B00G5G7EXY|4.0|If you know the Disney tropes by now, you know what to expect: girl suffers tragedy, boy overcomes great odds to rescue her, boy and girl get married, the end.  That's exactly what &#34;Frozen&#34; expects you to think, and it cleverly plays against every standard trope to upend our expectations about what true love is all about.  In this case, it's sisterly love.<br /><br />In the kingdom of Arendelle, Elsa (Idina Menzel) the elder has Ice Man-like powers to create snow.  Her sister Anna (Kristen Bell) thinks this is the best thing ever and encourages her to make snowmen in the palace ballroom, including a little guy who &#34;likes warm hugs&#34; named Olaf (Josh Gad). An accidental use of her powers nearly kills Anna, which causes Elsa's parents to lock her away and forbid contact with the outside world.  Shortly thereafter, the king and queen are lost at sea, leaving Elsa to come out of her shell on coronation day.<br /><br />The rush of new experiences is too much for the sisters.  For Elsa, her powers (tied to her emotions) are unleashed in a big way, creating an unending winter and causing her to flee into the mountains.  For Anna, she falls instantly in love with the first prince she meets, Hans (Santino Fontana) and plans to wed.  It's all very fairy tale standard...and then Frozen takes an unexpected turn when Anna, not Hans, decides to go after her sister.  This is a tale in which the women are firmly in control.<br /><br />Along the way, Anna meets Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and his reindeer Sven.  Kristoff mostly just stays out of Anna's way, all the while acting as a foil to explain how marrying the first guy she meets is pretty much the dumbest thing he's ever heard. It's a gentle attack on decades of Disney lore, but it's about time.  The finale revolves around a lifesaving act of true love -- but it's not what you think.<br /><br />&#34;Frozen's&#34; special effects are gorgeous, particularly the snow and ice crystals in 3D. The character designs are distinctly reminiscent of &#34;Sleeping Beauty,&#34; an intentional parallel to show how different the characters are from their archetypes. Anna looks and acts a lot like Rapunzel, complete with verbal and physical expressions that are far more modern than previous princesses.  The songs are cute but not nearly as catchy as say &#34;The Lion King&#34; or &#34;The Little Mermaid.&#34; And Olaf is there to keep the kiddies entertained -- the high point is when the little snowman imagines how awesome summer must be (nobody has the heart to tell him).<br /><br />And that's what's so great about &#34;Frozen.&#34; It could easily be a cynical, cold-hearted approach to its subject matter, but instead it manages to be both earnest and sincere while still maintaining that ignorance is not bliss.  A warm tale for a cold season.distinctly reminiscent of &#34;Sleeping Beauty,&#34; an intentional parallel to show how different the characters are from their archetypes.

B008JFUS28|3.0|So at this point, comic book movie fans are watching every Marvel movie to keep &#34;The Avengers&#34; flame alive.  It's certainly why I keep watching &#34;S.H.I.E.L.D.&#34; despite its mediocre plotlines and acting, and it's what lured me to &#34;Iron Man 3&#34; (even though Iron Man didn't need any help).  So watching &#34;Thor: The Dark World&#34; has become a necessity just to get all the inside jokes from the Marvel marketing juggernaut. Despite the world-shattering implications, not a whole lot happens.<br /><br />&#34;The Dark World&#34; begins with the dark elves, an evil race hell bent on reclaiming the universe with dark matter using a magical weapon of mass destruction called the Aether. These elves are led by Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), and he uses dark matter to create killing machines known as the Kursed. Defeated by Odin's (Anthony Hopkins) predecessor Bor (Tony Curran), the dark elves have since gone into hibernation, waiting for the right moment to return and wield the Aether once more.  In case you're wondering, these dark elves do not wear a hooded cloak and wield two swords -- and until later, their skin is pale white, not dark black.<br /><br />Stumbling into this mess is poor Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), our super-smart damsel in distress who just happens to pass between worlds and absorb the Aether.  It seems the Aether likes to live inside people, making Jane a Distress Ball -- a character to be batted back and forth between Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Odin, and Malekith.  Girl meets god, bad guy steals girl, god saves her and the nine worlds.  You get the idea.<br /><br />Where &#34;The Dark World&#34; rises above its mediocre plot is when Thor teams up with Loki (Tom Hiddleston).  Loki chews the scenery with glee, and the half-brothers' shared pain makes them a snarky combination that's a pleasure to watch. It doesn't last nearly long enough, and in no time Loki's back to being sneaky and Thor's back to hitting things with Meow-Meow -- Dary Lewis' (Kat Dennings) name for Thor's hammer, Mjolnir.<br /><br />The special effects are excellent, including Hemsworth with his shirt off, but that's simply obscuring the fact that despite a planar conjunction and a battle for the universe, &#34;The Dark World&#34; feels trite.  It's not that &#34;The Dark World&#34; is bad, it's just that it's not up to the quality of the other Marvel movies.w -- Dary Lewis' (Kat Dennings) name for Thor's hammer, Mjolnir.<br /><br />The special effects are excellent, including Hemsworth with his shirt off, but that's simply obscuring the fact that despite a planar conjunction and a battle for the universe, &#34;The Dark World&#34; feels trite.

B00A2H9OZS|3.0|I've been a fan of Riddick (Vin Diesel) since his debut, way back in &#34;Pitch Black&#34; when the glassy-eyed badass from the underworld of space first showed us that his streetfighting skills were more than a match for sound-sensing aliens.  Three films and five years later after the last installment, he's come full circle with a movie named merely &#34;Riddick.&#34;<br /><br />Where last we saw Riddick, he followed the Necromonger motto of &#34;you keep what you kill&#34; to its logical conclusion, which led to him killing the Lord Marshall and taking his place, Conan-style, on the throne. But it turns out Riddick didn't quite fulfill the oath required for the office, and with assassins lurking everywhere (particularly in his harem), things simply aren't fun anymore.  Riddick wants out, and strikes a deal with Commander Vaako (Karl Urban) to take him back to his homeworld of Furya (fans will remember Riddick is a Furyan, the last of his kind). Vaako gets to be Lord Marshall in exchange.  Sounds simple, right?<br /><br />It's perhaps no surprise that the Necromongers are not content to let Riddick walk off into the sunset.  Krone (Andreas Apergis), Vaako's right-hand man, tries to kill Riddick off.  And for a brief moment we see Riddick with the same superpowers the previous Lord Marshall had in the last act of the previous film.  Exactly how one acquires these powers (given that he didn't take the oath) is an open question -- as well as when he loses them.  But needless to say Riddick survives the betrayal at great personal cost on a very hostile planet that isn't Furya.<br /><br />Despite some leaps of logic, for the first half of the film &#34;Riddick&#34; is near perfection.  It's Riddick, being his badass self, against a host of vicious creatures, ranging from jackal-like canines to mud demons.  The mud demons are the most innovative part of the film, and Riddick's discovery of their ecology is part of the joy of &#34;Riddick.&#34;  His eventual friendship with a jackal beast even makes Riddick a likable Davy Crockett of outer space.<br /><br />Then everybody else shows up.  To be fair, Riddick invited them there, brazenly showing his face on a distress beacon to lure mercenaries with the intent of hijacking one of their ships.  It's at this point that &#34;Riddick&#34; takes a turn for the worse as every sci-fi macho stereotype shows up to strut and spit, mucking up the elegant beauty that was the first half of the film.<br /><br />The first group is a bunch of space pirates led by a filthy and violent fellow named Santana (Jordi Molla).  The second is a military-style operation led by the crisp Boss Johns (Matt Nable). It's of note that accompanying Johns' team is sniper Dahl (Katee Sackhoff).  Riddick proceeds to play a cat-and-mouse game with the mercenaries, offing them one by one, interspersed with some pretty bad dialogue in which Riddick laughs at his enemies and promises to do things to the women.<br /><br />There are some ties to the previous films, most specifically in Boss Johns' connecting to a character from &#34;Pitch Black.&#34; It's also worth noting that the religious figure here, instead of being Muslim, is firmly Christian -- and that's a shame, as &#34;Pitch Black&#34; was willing to differentiate its future with a non-European perspective.<br /><br />In a sense, that's the flaw of &#34;Riddick&#34;: there's a distinct string of misogyny running throughout -- at one point, Santana tries to rape Dahl but it's no big deal because she fights him off. The fact that &#34;Dahl&#34; sounds like &#34;doll&#34; and that Sackhoff takes off her top are certainly not related.<br /><br />Riddick's stealth and killing skills border on Batman-levels -- which he didn't have when facing down against the mud demons.  And of course, those mud demons show up in great numbers due to a natural phenomenon. Or to put it another way, &#34;Riddick&#34; is a lot like &#34;Pitch Black&#34; only with more nudity.<br /><br />That said, &#34;Riddick&#34; isn't a bad film, and is still arguably better than &#34;The Chronicles of Riddick.&#34;  But setting the bar low doesn't make it an improvement.  This is a bridge film to get us to a bigger budget in the next installment. Hopefully it's worth the wait.at said, &#34;Riddick&#34; isn't a bad film, and is still arguably better than &#34;The Chronicles of Riddick.&#34;  But setting the bar low doesn't make it an improvement.

B005LAIIGW|5.0|&#34;Gravity&#34; is the latest in a long tradition of films in which survival in a hostile environment is a series of hops from one slightly habitable sanctuary to another.  It can be in a desert, underwater, or in space, but the premise is the same: one person against all odds tests her own mettle to (hopefully) survive and in doing so, come out a better person in the end.  In the case of Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), it's a form of rebirth.<br /><br />Stone is on her first mission aboard the Space Shuttle Explorer with veteran astronauts Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) and Shariff Dasari (Phaldut Sharma). It's not long before things go horribly awry in the form of a Russian missile strike on a defunct satellite, which triggers a recurring boogeyman: floating debris pierces everything in its path every 90 minutes.  The cloud of debris is catastrophic, and it's not long before Stone is on her own doing her best to survive.  But does she want to?  Lurking in Stone's past is the death of her daughter due to an accident, and she has been sleepwalking through life up to this point.  Kowalski (one of the few characters in Stone's literal universe) challenges her on this point.<br /><br />And so begins a desperate struggle for Stone, alone and only partially trained, in the most hostile environment imaginable.  She battles the triple threat of asphyxiation, hypothermia, and insanity. On the third point &#34;Gravity&#34; distinguishes itself from other films, led by Bullock's excellent acting as a woman under extreme pressure.<br /><br />Bullock (nearly 50, if you can believe it) is stripped to her core, both emotionally and physically, until there is nothing left.  And then, like a babe, must struggle her way out of tight spaces and cramped airlocks in a battle to return home.  Expertly shot and breathtakingly choreographed, &#34;Gravity&#34; is a thrilling spectacle in 3D.  It's a heavy subject, but well worth the ride.
B006JD48NM|4.0|This documentary has tons of interesting footage from the 3 years Senna was world champion of formula racing.  It brings up valid questions to what degree money and technology should be allowed to change the performance of the cars and if there should be a full year of grace period for mechanics and engineers to comply.  It also shows rules may be arbitrarily changed depending on how many points behind and what nationality the 2nd place driver is .  When you consistently defeat other cars by a full lap, even the nicest person may draw jealousy and hostility from the organization.
B008JFUS8M|5.0|&#34;The Hunger Games&#34; series is theoretically a young-adult series about one girl's struggles in a post-apocalyptic world where food is scarce and children battle for the entertainment of the upper classes. &#34;Catching Fire&#34; gives us a window into that world that &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; only hinted at.  It is an alternately thrilling and depressing view of a world burning with hope that Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) inadvertently started by simply surviving her first Hunger Games.<br /><br />It all starts with President Snow (Donald Sutherland) openly threatening Katniss' family.  She must keep up appearances by smiling and delivering on the fairy tale ending promised by the conclusion of the first film.  But her victory tour, with her faux romantic interest Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) at her side, slowly peels back layer after layer of just how bad things are.  Anyone even showing a hint of support for Katniss is executed.  The whirlwind press tour featuring Katniss and Peeta only further inflames the rebels to fight against the hierarchy of Panem. So Snow hatches up another plan with a new gamemaker, Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman). And that plan is another Hunger Games.<br /><br />And so we have the centerpiece of the film, which is in fact a small part of a much larger narrative -- people fighting in a hostile environment. This Hunger Games is different; the contestants are all survivors of previous games, and they're pretty pissed off to find government reneging on its promise of keeping them safe after surviving the last one.<br /><br />A motley crew of contestants are assembled, some perfect for the role like Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin) and others like the mute grandmotherly Mags (Lynn Cohen).  But the real twist is that this installment of The Hunger Games isn't about the Hunger Games at all. It's about the world on fire, and even Katniss is just a small spark amidst the blaze.<br /><br />The most frustrating part of &#34;Catching Fire&#34; is that it covers so much and yet is incomplete. It ends on a difficult note without resolution, which just makes it that much harder waiting for the next installment.4;Catching Fire&#34; is that it covers so much and yet is incomplete.

B001ECDVKE|3.0|This might have been a five star film if about 20 minutes were edited out.  The scenes of martians went on so long that I eventually found them more annoying than funny, amusing, or interesting.  Even in a comedy, extra terrestrials should have a little more mystery about them.  I also wanted more scenes with the rednecks but fewer with the politicians and soldiers.  It's still worth watching once but the comparisons with &#34;Dr. Strangelove&#34; and &#34;The Day The Earth Stood Still&#34; are quite numerous and obvious.
B00EHMG358|5.0|great book.  I really like their writing.  They keep you on the edge of your seat. I have read many of their books.
B00ET2ODTE|3.0|I never read anything Linda Lovelace wrote because it's impossible to discern how much was true.  Who would buy her books if they were typical bland stories of &#34;I rejected my parents, married a hoodlum, and started hooking to support my drug habit?&#34; To be fair, the film gives the surface events, then starts over with her later claims of unpleasant things going on behind the scenes.  I have no doubt men this violent existed.  I'm just not totally convinced her husband was one of them.  At least she found a few years of relative happiness before the fatal car accident.
B005LLSZNM|4.0|Season 4 had too many distractions such as the Ireland connections that attempt to make the MC a player on the world stage.  I think the show should have stuck to more believable plots, but the acting was still very good.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Very good read one of Mitch's best.  I don't know why I need more words but I was told there is a minimum so I am typing to waste my time.
B00DJ4PIBK|5.0|Wonderfully creative. A surprise every  morning. Makes each day a little more special.  LEGO quality, as usual. Well worth the price
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Was like reliving those days Great development of characters it all seemed very real and true to the era and times
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|Fun game, good graphics &amp; set up well. As someone else noted, you HAVE to purchase credits at some points to move forward in game.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Allan, the 100-year-old man, like Zelig and Forest Gump, has been present for every key event of the 20th Century. Even though he doesn't care about politics, he has played a key role in all the major events--friend of Franco, drinking buddy of Harry Truman, dinner guest of Stalin, and more. The story alternates between Allan' s illustrious past and his adventures with a bunch of never-do-wells beginning on his 100th birthday, when he makes his escape from the Old Folks Home. A very enjoyable read!
B00B4RP0OO|3.0|Downloaded this to my android phone.  Plays MKV files from my home network very well, but my vob files do not even show up....so this app is ok for MKV but not VOB.
B001DUDKEY|4.0|A little slow at points, as typical of Jane Austen, but a great love story.  Clean and promoting of good values.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|An enjoyable romp, Stephen king transports you back in time through his incredibly descriptive writing and creates a very vivid picture of late 50s early 60's America. So why only three stars?  Simply because the story is too long. the centre section exists almost exclusively to allow the relationships between the two main characters to be built.<br /><br />The relationship becomes increasingly intertwined with the assassination and as such is an essential plot line however it simply did not require so many pages.<br /><br />However I have to admit in any story I relish the action but yawn through the kissy bits...
B00F4PM6WG|5.0|my 4 year old really enjoys this.  I'm a little surprised, because it's a very simple game and it's the same thing over and over again.  but he loves it.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|The movie was entertaining. However more historical information would have been greatly appreciated. A better explanation why her special helpers were chosen or any explanation would have been good as well.
0767903862|5.0|Bill Bryson delivers! Even though I have never been to Australia I was delighted with this book. Bryson gives the full range – history, natural history (botany, zoology. paleontology...), people insights, cities, outback towns and scenic wonders of which there are plenty of in Australia – a truly Renaissance view of the continent. Plus it’s hilarious – his encounters with other tourists, seedy hotels, pubs, waiters and hotel receptionists – but especially cricket!<br /><br />The man ingests humour into diverse situations and the book radiates with enjoyment and makes Australia out to be a remarkable place one wants to visit. If it wasn’t for the enormous distance I’d board a plane tomorrow. And its’ the distances within the place too – I didn’t know that Uluru (more commonly known as Ayers rock) is smack in the middle of the country. It’s true as Mr. Bryson says that it is the great distances that make the country so fascinating. Its’ a sparsely populated and urbanized country, with vast unknown tracts of land with unique animals and plants scattered hither and thither, amidst a wonderful geographic landscape.<br /><br />We are also presented with a sad view of the Aboriginal people of Australia who have been co-opted out of society and live in a fringe and destitute world.<br /><br />All and all it’s a great read for all Bryson fans!<br /><br />A short excerpt (page 182, my book)<br />“The Chinese restaurant was just across the road as promised, but according to a sign in the window it was not licensed to serve alcohol and I couldn’t face small-town Chinese food without the solace of beer. I have travelled enough to know that a chef does not, as a rule, settle in a place like Macksville because he has a lifelong yearning to share the subtleties of 3,500 years of Szechuan cuisine with sheep farmers.”
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|It's well written - more like a novel - and ties the events together nicely giving the reader a good grasp of the important events of the period.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun rush when You win.  Frustrating when you try over and over and over to win and you just can't make it through the level.
0316666343|5.0|Love, love, love this book. A really good book to curl up to. Makes you hold your children closer too.
0553582011|4.0|Book 5 was pretty boring but I'm committed to the series and was glad to find this one quite a bit better.  Fewer random arcs to the storyline and better progress overall.  Still, some things were uneven like Bran's storyline is barely touched while others dominate.  I'm sure I'll read the next one.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|What I have come to expect from a Grisham book, beginning to end, captivating, insightful and entertaining. With so many of his earlier books, a must read.
B006S08RLU|4.0|Amelie is funny, witty and very entertaining. Audrey Tautou is wonderful.  I would recommend this film to anyone who is planning to visit Paris.
B00BKTFABE|3.0|only because I haven't figured out how to delete photos and video's on this devise.  just needs a delete button that is accessable.
B008JDAC7G|2.0|Sort of a weird tower stacking game. Each building is a different color that you can throw away to make combos as they stack on top of each other. If you feed a certain color to the correct colored monster you get bonus points. It's pretty much a see how good you can do game and offers nothing outside of that.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|wow!  He's back!  Great read with all of the Southern nuances, courtroom drama, and plot twists of a Classic Grisham.  I was sad when I finished it...will be hard to find another as good as this.
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|It's easy to play and is enjoyable as well. My only complaints are that it doesn't come with a lot of levels and the graphics don't really look that good. Still, It's a free deluxe version from a company who puts out great games, Hard not to pick up.
0767903862|5.0|Great book especially if you're traveling to Australia.  Lots of fascinating facts and laugh out loud humor.  Several people recommended this book to me.  I will do the same!
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|I love it on pc and mobile. This game is difficult fun and you never run out of stuff to do. It is like a more enemy focused 2D minecraft.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Excellent story! It's been a while since I found a book that I couldn't put down, read it in three days,  I was SO engrossed in it! Well done Mr. King...WELL DONE!
B003K16P3M|5.0|This is my favorite book! I've read it 3 times I love it so much! I feel that Kristin Cashore did an awesome job at making this fantasy realistic and believable! It's been awhile since I read it last but i still constantly think about it. I will most likely read it again sometime!
B001HBYH9Q|2.0|maybe even one star... some cute lines but otherwise a &#34;nothing hill&#34; movie.  Stale, predictable.  We really wanted to like it but didn't...
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Laughed until I cried. Laughed until my stomach hurt. Laughed until I couldn't laugh anymore.  My wife and I like to sit on the couch and read it aloud, because it's even funnier when you're trying to fight through the giggles and finish the paragraph.  Most of the time, you fail.  Everyone I know is getting this for Christmas.

B00C1BHQXK|5.0|A great guide book to read over and over. I've got too many highlights to just review them with proper context
B005R32L66|4.0|It works pretty good with my Android tablet. I got a good picture from my friend, she could see and hear me fine. The program worked very well, perhaps just as good as the Skype program I have on my Windows 7 laptop. I was pretty impressed with it. If you'd like to use this program on a tablet, go and try it. For those who don't have a smartphone like myself, this may be a good substitute to see your friends on your tablet or laptop.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great read as I am  history buff. I enjoy reading about present day history making events. Also, this book is written by a Seal that was one of the main personnel involved in the actual mission.
B008RF0M9O|5.0|These are great. Basically like factory for the Sony MDR-V6. Will purchase again. For the price it's a great replacement product.
B008QLXSG8|5.0|The book literally brought tears to my eye when I was reading the part where Meursault was confronting the chaplain thinking that he was condemned only because he didn't cry on his mother's funeral. This professionally written book really does have a profound meaning of life, death and humanity.
B0049H9NVW|5.0|Takenoko is a nice light game that is easy to learn and fun to play. I wasn't sure if it was a good buy when I first purchased it; now Takenoko is a game that I like to use to introduce people to board gaming.<br /><br />Overall Look, Quality and Durability:<br />The artwork looks really good and the game pieces are well designed. The tiles are made of pretty durable cardboard type material, and the cards are of similar quality to standard paper playing cards. The cards are a little small, so strip shuffling or just mixing the cards around is probably the best way to randomize each objective deck. The figurines look nice; my panda lost one of his ears but I just super glued that piece right back in. As you continue to use the game pieces, the edges will wear a little bit, but not by a significant amount. The box has really good storage compartments for each of your game pieces, which is a definite plus in my book.<br /><br />Rules and Gameplay:<br />The game is very easy to learn and the game plays very well. The average game will take about 45 minutes. There are a few rules that you might miss the first couple of times, but you should be very familiar with all of the rules in one or two plays.<br /><br />Luck vs. Strategy:<br />Where luck is concerned, players might be able to score points more easily than others if their initial objectives synergize well with each other. Conversely, it might be hard to get the ball rolling if your initial objectives do not synergize with each other. Good dice rolls can significantly help you win the game, but most rolls will get you closer to completing an objective.<br />Takenoko is somewhere between light and moderate in terms of strategy. Since there are 15 objectives, it's quite possible to calculate, for example, the best possible objective to draw. You can also pick up tells on which objectives your opponents are trying to complete and hinder their progress. Good strategy will definitively help people familiar with the game.<br /><br />Balance:<br />There some balance issues that will become pretty obvious with multiple playthroughs. Most people will probably end up playing only one land (blue) objective and most people will try to complete as many panda objectives as possible. You can hinder people favoring panda objectives by throwing down land with enclosures. Additionally, if you institute the advanced variant, a player will be only allowed to complete each of the four panda objectives once, requiring them to supplement their score sheet with land and gardener objectives. Neither of these balance issues are game breaking, but if you think of good ways to address them via house rules, please let me know!<br /><br />Overall:<br />I strongly enjoy the overall gameplay of Takenoko and will usually bring it out on game nights. Despite the minor balance issues, I think Takenoko is a game worth getting and I highly recommend it.
B00GQ7PILC|5.0|Although plot holes are prevalent throughout the finale season, I thought where the characters ended up was appropriate to the character development. Dexter in his own hell to protect his loved ones. That he had &#34;loved ones&#34; by the end of the series was the arc of the story. To feel can be miserable, and to live with what you did to people you love can be an eternal hell. The acting by the main cast was always outstanding, the guest stars incredible. I loved Dexter, some seasons more than others, but even the worst of Dexter was better than 98% of anything else offered on television. I will miss the series very much.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Hands down, my favorite nature series.  I'm glad the BBC version was available because I personally prefer David Attenborough's voice over Sigourney Weaver (Discovery channel version).
B00GLX0Z8C|5.0|Very good comedy that had me laughing many times with it's wittiness and satire. Definitely worth the watch and would watch again!!!
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|I enjoyed the book but it was just okay for me. When I read a thriller I expect more heart thumping anticipation. I actually got none of that in this book. Predictable and anti climatic but characters were likeable, especially Jack Reacher.
B00G5G7EXY|5.0|Awesome! I loved this movie! If you mix Beauty and the Beast with Tangled you might be close to this good.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I absolutely loved the movie it was amazing awesome and action packed. but one thing I didn't get was, where the x-men and spiderman  during all of this I mean the x manor is in new york along with spiderman I mean It would be awesome if the wolverine and the x-men and spiderman at least made a cameo during this, beating the crud out of the Chitauri along with the avengers. but thats just me that's my only complaint about this movie. I definitely recommend this movie.
B000HF0KXU|1.0|To much bad language and vulgar content to even enjoy the movie.  Like the actors and would love to see them in a different movie that is nicer to watch.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Even though it had a lot of people in the book, John G. made it clear who they were and I could picture them in my mind.  Read it is 3 days...good read as usual and better than some others.
1401917232|5.0|I have read all three of Gary Renard's books and this one was exceptional. I have been a student in the Course in Miracles for many years and after reading Gary's three books I understand The Course in Miracles so much better. I love the loving message of both Gary's books and the Course in Miracles--to know that God is all Love and that we can return to GOD or better yet to know we never left God That is an awesome lesson.  What a better lesson that GOD has forgotten no one and we are all one in God all inclusive no one left out. What a loving message. The need and the process of  Quantum forgiveness is explained in detain in this book.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great app - easy to navigate through. it's very intuitive. it certainly worth downloading. I would recommend it to anyone interested in reading and studying the bible
B00FMAZ49U|4.0|The only minus is that its hard to accurate line-up the protector when applying it with the cut-out for the earpiece. Some kind of alignment tool would be helpful.
B004G600A4|1.0|Love the movie, but for some reason, the DVD only would work on 1 of our DVD players.  On all others it would say, no disc found (They are all Blu Ray).  Then last week, it stopped working the in the 1 DVD player that it was ok in.  Not sure where this DVD came from, but it was a rip off and someone sold me a bad DVD.  Quite a shame because it is one of my daughters favorite movies!
B008AIGWVA|4.0|I love this game and so does my mom. I just can't get any new potions.I love to talk to  him and it is really fun I can recommend it for even the most boring of people!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|A really good simulation for deer hunting and other game. It's only downside was the fact that animals could fall through trees.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Another great album from the Piano Guys. Great songs, so much talent. This is an album the whole family enjoys. The videos are so fun to watch and it includes the &#34;Yule log&#34; with the entire album so you can listen on your tv and have a &#34;fire&#34; to warm the room.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I bought this specifically to use with Netflix, so I knew going in that the content that was compatible was limited, but that was fine with me. For thirty-five bucks, you CAN NOT GO WRONG. It's so easy to set up; took me all of five minutes before I was watching YouTube and Netflix. Quality is fantastic.
B009PLKCEE|1.0|Would not play the .tp and .ts formats needed. Did not have enough support for various different video types and formats.
B00DZJ82W6|5.0|This is truly a Masterpiece.  The various re-takes gives the listener real insight into one of the greatest artist of all-time
B00BXDOSXS|1.0|Does not play .ts and .tp files. This program does not have the support I needed for various video formats.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|As always, Child weaves a great story around a now iconic character in Jack Reacher,  This story does not disappoint with its many solid supporting characters and plot twists.  I find it amazing to get into Reacher's head as he puts together seemingly disparate facts and circumstances to solve the dilemma he faces.  Of course, the mayhem he is capable of inflicting on those unwise enough to cross him always helps.  Loved it.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|its great app play fun  game play cards cards play ok i like lots i play bored am i eat cards
B005O64VH8|4.0|I have purchased other recordings from this group and I must say that they are consistent with their song writing and performance abilities.  Very relaxing, romantic and introspective music.
0061978078|4.0|Wow, this is the fastest I've ever read a sequel after I finished the first book in a long time. I usually don't like reading all the books in a series right after one another, but I've become so hooked into this world that Lauren Oliver has created. I almost don't want to start Requiem, knowing that it's the last one! But, ummm, I kind of HAVE TO after that crazy, intense cliffhanger (yes, another one). I'm actually a fan of cliffhangers, because they make me more motivated to continue on in the series, but I hate feeling like this! I love this series so much...I just want to know what happens already. But, at the same time, don't want it to end.<br /><br />I hate writing reviews of sequels for some reason, so this is going to be pretty short. I only rated it four stars because I found that some of the magic from the first book was missing in this one. I liked the slow-building tension and plot of the first one, and that there wasn't so much action. So, while I appreciated the fact that Lena's character seriously grows and has way more depth in this book, I didn't totally like that it was action-packed the entire time. Although it did kind of work, and I do think that it was necessary in how it was able to move the series along.<br /><br />I also really did not enjoy how this book was split into alternating time periods (&#34;then&#34; and &#34;now&#34;). I was super interested in what was happening and in the &#34;now,&#34; but, while the &#34;then&#34; stuff is super important and has some great characters and character development going on, it just seemed less crucial since you already kind of know what's going to happen because you're reading the &#34;now&#34; chapters in between.<br /><br />And I did not like Julian. Don't get me wrong...he's great as a character and a cool addition to the story considering who he is, but to have a new love interest so soon after my heart was freaking RIPPED OUT OF MY CHEST during the ending of the last book was just too much. I didn't quite believe that Lena was able to move on from Alex so quickly. She did have some emotional tension with that, but it just didn't seem like enough to me. I mean, I was more upset about it than she was, haha!<br /><br />ON TO REQUIEM!!I didn't quite believe that Lena was able to move on from Alex so quickly. She did have some emotional tension with that, but it just didn't seem like enough to me. I mean, I was more upset about it than she was, haha!<br /><br />ON TO REQUIEM!!
B002C6A6N6|5.0|Pefect for the DR QUINN LOVER
0553582011|4.0|Oh my gosh... I can't believe I actually finished all five of these freaking books. Like usual, I don't feel like I can really review A DANCE WITH DRAGONS. So much that happens (pretty much everything) would be a spoiler for somebody who hasn't read the series yet, or is only on the first book.<br /><br />As for the parts that I can review, I actually had a lot of trouble with this book. I was so aggravated by the first 60% of this book. It took me weeks to get through because it was so slow and just dragged on and on and on. I had to force myself to keep reading! And I never felt like that with any of the other books, except maybe through some little parts in A CLASH OF KINGS.<br /><br />But after I got through the first 60% of the book, the rest just flew by. It got super interesting and I could barely put it down. There was even one part towards the end of the book that made me almost come to tears.<br /><br />I'm very excited to see where George is going to go next with these story lines. There are so many awesome possibilities running through my head. Now that I finally have the series (the ones that are currently out, at least) finished, I can't wait to go back and re-read the books from the beginning. There are so many things that I know that I missed or didn't pick up on the first time around.

B00GH4RKYM|4.0|I thought it was good for the most part.  There were some fight scenes that were a little too long and it was somewhat predictable but definitely worth watching.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in a very long time! I combined reading with the audiobook and it was great, because there were certain things I wanted to go back and read. I felt like I kinda knew where the story was going to go, but I enjoyed the journey anyway. I can't wait to read more books by Jojo Moyes.
B00AKO93JK|2.0|I should have only downloaded free version what a waste! I downloaded this one thinking it came with the kettle bell and ball workouts it doesn't how disappointing and what a ripoff! I would have to pay 9.99 to add those!
B00AEFXORM|5.0|Tom Cruise - playing against type - is masterful as an underworld hitman who commandeers Jamie Fox and his cab in order to carry out a string of assassinations on government witnesses before they can testify against the thug who hired Cruise.<br />Fox turns in a memorable performance as the cabby who turns the tables on Cruise when he discovers the identity of one of Cruise's targets.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is one of the books that everyone in my high school actually read during English class.  I've reread this book about 100 times and I still love it
B005ZMTXMY|1.0|i did not realize I was ordering a digital movie only to be viewed on my computer. I was trying to order a gift for my nephew for the holidays. now I am stuck with a movie that I do not want and cannot give to him. any way to return this? it was purchased only minutes ago.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The book was a very easy read and kept me engaged.  I thought the last book wasn't as good as the first two though.
B007EC27QM|5.0|This is a great basic calculator.  I have used it several times with ease.  I would recommend it.  It is easy to use and easy to access.  I hope this is helpful.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Neon Flow is a deceptively simple puzzle game. You connect dots of the same color by drawing a line that connects them. Simple on the surface but it give your mind a workout as you struggle to connect all the dots within a minimum amount of moves.
B00GIZO674|5.0|Excited to see this offered for the kindle.  Burger Shop 1 &amp; 2 player from way back.. Very addicted . I have them on my desk &amp; laptop.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is a free running game where you move your avatar with a swipe of your finger to gather coins and avoid obstacles that will end your run. The longer you run you will gain achievements and coins that you can get boost or unlock other avatars to replace the default one.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great brain teaser.  My girls really enjoy this and now have gotten me hooked on it.  We spend time helping each other figure out the maze.
B00ESNE696|5.0|Clever PLOTS and intricate twists.  Characters are multilevel and actors are superb.  Pace is quick.  Loyalties switched frequently.  See it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so addictive.  You can play this game for hours without noticing the time.  Even my girls love the game and I am glad it was made available for the kindle. Now can keep them off mine
0446547638|4.0|Another well-written and interesting book from Nicholas Sparks! There were points where the book seemed a bit stiff, but most of it was well-written and crafted for an unexpected end.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I have so much fun with this game. I love the movies so in turn I knew I would love this game.
B00GFOIUVQ|5.0|Pretty good game, I would buy it even if it costs money! It is based off the movie which I loved, overall, pretty impressive! (:
B00CM4VC7M|2.0|it's to fragile I can barely touch it the right arm couldn't never move it's hard to change the faces and I spent all that money for nothing...
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I haven't had one problem out of this app. I really enjoy it, the only thing I don't care for is how big it is.
B001HN690O|5.0|If you're a grandparent of young grandchildren, then get this and the original Kung Fu Panda.  I have spent hours watching both of these very entertaining movies with my grandchildren.
B00AECGQF2|1.0|I got this game because I saw my friend have it and it was fun but then after a few game plays the screen goes black and says not responding. Please fix!
B0033H7VI6|5.0|If I was going hunting or camping this is the Knife you want. This knife is so big and so thick it can get any job done. Don't take my word for it look at the reviews, look at my review heck.
B0010X758Q|2.0|When I got this album, straight out of the sleeve, it was terribly warped. And then, after playing side one, the first song on side two was unplayable. It skipped every second.  All the other semi-well, but some songs skipped a lot due to the warping. Overall, I was disappointed with the album, but not with its content. Vampire Weekend is a great band, but this record came in pretty bad condition. I would recommend buying it, but maybe not straight from amazon.
B00GTZN0X4|2.0|A Simple rewrite of Cars... Lame...Expect more of Pixar  Would not bother to watch, supected as much.. oh Well, cheaper than the Theater
B00CEB5QU2|5.0|Works as a samba server if you want to avoid using the horrid Android app.  A downside is that I can't find a way to make it forget a network once it connects, without doing a full factory reset.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|Keeps me on my toes, great story line and graphics. Haven't had issues with glitches either. Mini games are fairly simple. Over all keeps me wanting to play.
1594746168|4.0|This is an odd book consisting mainly of really interesting and well-done drawings of mythological creatures. The text is rather peculiar and not all that interesting. It tries to provide a reason for the existence of these drawings; it's a bio of a fictional &#34;mad-scientist&#34; who tried to create these creatures from the parts of more than one species so he could pass them off as real. After a while, he comes to believe in his own faked creations, destroying his family in the course of his career. The bio is written very straight-forward without really drawing the reader into the story. The drawings make the book so special. They are really well done and almost convincing at times. They take up 3/4 of the book's contents. I enjoyed it, as have friends I've shown it to.
B00G91WB3S|5.0|My husband has watched it 4x in 1 weekend! My kids love it too.  My family would definitely recommend it!
B00CATSONE|4.0|This is a short but well written bio of Tesla. The man was a genius who had to fight against the world and, in particular, the notoriously underhanded Thomas Edison, to try and get his ideas and inventions across. Edison screwed him over in a big way. If Tesla and Edison had traded places success-wise, we might well have been transmitting electricity through the air rather than through wires for the past 70 or so years, thus saving much of our environment. The loss of Tesla's mind was a terrible loss to the world.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love the this app . Downloaded Temple Run 1&amp; 2 . Can't get enough of both apps .  Never boring . Have to quick ,on top of your game with these apps . Oh ! And Temple Run 2 is free to like 1 . Gotta love that .So far this one works on my Kindle Fire Hd no crashes or freezes . I highly recommend this app for your customers .
B000JMKQX0|2.0|Has some really bogus ideas about military weapons capability that are crucial to the story, but besides that the format just didn't work for me.  The reports from people were interesting but too disjointed for me to really get a picture and each was too short to really paint a picture of what it was like in that part of the world.  So while interesting at first, it just didn't grab me after the initial novelty wore off.
B0086700CM|5.0|Really love this app. Works on kindle fire hd. GLADE Amazon now has this app to download. Free at that. Works good so far no crashes or freezes on it. Fast, have to be on top of your game . I recommend this app for kindle fire hd to try and Don't forget it's FREE. LOVE that !
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Funny and moving, great acting make watching this movie a wonderful experience. I don't understand why it isn't more popular.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Awsome book surely to be read by others who like zombie or action anything the book is really detailed and pulse rising
B00COHIFQS|4.0|Okay, so we didn't expect this.  Granted, we had no idea what to expect, but we were pretty impressed with it.
0061906220|5.0|Such a great book! My, at the time 5 year old, had mentioned this book to me. After he helped me read it, and knew he loved the book because of the sing-song type reading, I knew he wanted it for his 6th birthday. You can't go wrong with a child's book! Such a fun read, and the kids love singing with it!
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|Superman kiils.  That bothered me.  But what really got me:  the SLOW pace of the middle section.  Other reviewers are correct  - 3 movies here - Krypton, lost boy-man, crazy fight scenes.  Krypton gets an A- for the first 30 or so minutes; crazy fights get a B; middle drawn out section gets a D... if I'm feeling generous.
B000007UXS|5.0|What I like, is very good fills my heart with joy. And some subjects leave my head. Hahaha!!!<br />They are a good alternative for the days you need them.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Grisham is a good story teller. His fiction is straightforward and comfortably easy to follow. For recreational reading I enjoy a writer who keeps me interested, but doesn't make me work hard. Grisham usually delivers and Sycamore Row is no exception. It gave me a few evenings of pleasure.
B0000CF35G|5.0|What I like, is very good fills my heart with joy. And some subjects leave my head. Hahaha!!!<br />They are a good alternative for the days you need them.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Typical Grisham, formulaic.  Entertaining, interesting characters, good plot, twists and turns.  Unfortunately you can see them coming and the ending left me high and dry.

B004I744AS|5.0|This app really helped me out with finding definitions for words I didn't know and doing my homework. The definitions were accurate and because of it I get A's on assignments here I need to find an accurate definition that matches the word. I have never had problems with this app. I hope this helps you! :-)

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Nice gadget, youtube looks amazing on the TV in HD. Netflix image quality is poor/SD at best. Very handy for watching a web clip on the TV with a few clicks. As more apps become available it will no doubt be used more often.<br /><br />UPDATE DEC 30: Netflix still poor quality, but Youtube continues to amaze me. I simply hit the Chromecast icon in Chrome (Windows 8) and the TV turns on and automatically tunes into the Chromecast device. Only downside is that my laptop (Toshiba with i5 4G RAM) starts to max out CPU when running youtube in fullscreen. Recommend full charge or plugging into power for long viewing sessions. Also, any video you can play in Chrome will be streamed, so now I can view any videos on network without hassle.
B005KGNN26|4.0|What I like, is very good fills my heart with joy. And some subjects leave my head. Hahaha!!!<br />They are a good alternative for the days you need them.
B003B02O0A|5.0|I would give it 4 1/2 really... It was an excellent book and I am stingy with my rating. The characters were believable, the setting of the story in the deep south was perfect and the actual story was believable and quite though provoking.  Having lived through the 60's and 70's it was very well written book, but what else can you expect from Grisham??
B0041KVYIW|5.0|What I like, is very good fills my heart with joy. And some subjects leave my head. Hahaha!!!<br />They are a good alternative for the days you need them.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Nice twist on playing solitare. Fun and challenging for all ages. Love the fact that it was free. Haven't been able to stop playing all day
B008XX6J92|2.0|I do not like is not my thing. So you see expect otherwise.<br />Before I had moved more topics.<br />Also has a great you.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun. Gr8 way to pass time. I was glued to the game for at least 30 min.

B000QCUB8I|5.0|Great CD. I would buy it again. In fact I might have to because it is stuck in my CD player in the car and I can't get it out.
B005NNML6K|5.0|What I like, is very good fills my heart with joy. And some subjects leave my head. Hahaha!!!<br />They are a good alternative for the days you need them.
B009AJDDQU|3.0|Great special effects. Good direction. Really weak story., and poor character development Left empty at the end. Overall it was disappointing.

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Finally, an Office app that will deal correctly with my spreadsheets. I use a few special functions and features in my spreadsheets to create drop-downs, selectable items, etc. and no other Office app has ever been able to open them correctly. This one does, all features are available.

B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Right on the beam. Anyone with a drinking or drug problem will hate this movie! Anyone in recovery will love it. Watch it with your favorite impaired person…They'll get real squirmy! Technically, I don't think I've ever seen better sfx, acting, etc. A timeless wonder!
B000NJXC4E|5.0|What I like, is very good fills my heart with joy. And some subjects leave my head. Hahaha!!!<br />They are a good alternative for the days you need them.
B009H7SCMA|5.0|I have to say lately my view of different genres i have usually avoided has become much more open (usually because the ones i have red have been brilliantly written) of late. This book adds more to that view. Usually a fan of non real-life situations such as horror, sci-fi or fantasy I have tended to not read things like this.<br />This book is not just another erotic fantasy its a comedy of sexual exploration mixed with points that are very relevant in everyday society. Alan has wrote this fantastic mix. Gabriella meets Jim and despite being of different backgrounds (which Alan writes very relevantly) they end up playing their own game of metaphorical cricket on a whole different patch.<br />Anyone who wants a different experience in reading but enjoys a comic masterpiece should check this out, anyone who already enjoys this genre you should enjoy without a second doubt. Thanks Alan!

B00A27X972|4.0|We read this book for our monthly book club discussion and almost everyone enjoyed it.  A very different story premise than any I've read before.  A unique perspective on life as a human.  Very easy to read book.

B003IWZ1D8|5.0|Nice shots of the old Westward-Ho Hotel in Phoenix in the opening shots... Classic Hitchcock horror that is even better in Blu-Ray.

B006WZLCZ4|5.0|The perfect size cookware for little hands.  It matches the kitchen perfectly.  In fact, the stove has a little storage shelf which holds the utensils and the salt and pepper shaker.  My two year old Grand Daughter loves this!

B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Like most Americans I can tell you precisely where I was and what I was doing 50 years ago when I learned of Kennedy's murder. And where I was for the next few days: glued to my television, crying as the heartbreaking events unfolded. I share the hero's desire to change history and I share his frustrations. I'm a big Stephen King fan and this may just be my all-time favorite.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|Flashy, but focused too much on the parties and not enough on the rest of the plot. Could've been a lot better.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Completely Addicted.  Even when I get stuck on certain levels I always come back.  Maybe I'll hit the 300's one day.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Love the weather channel; used it for many years, but while I realize you have to pay the bills, but the ads always on the screen are aggravating!
B0066WJLU6|5.0|it works very well, the light is bright enough to write by. there is a color change option. I haven't experienced any problems with this product.
B00GO95TAC|5.0|I thought the episode was great. I must say to those complaining about apparent shortcomings in the series plot line to this point and the episode itself: as far as the doctor going to 13 re generations and the so-called problems with that, as the doctor himself would say, pay attention! this problem has already been addressed and gotten over in both the reboot series and classic series. the master in the end of time episodes, somehow magically regenerated himself from sort of witches brew spell, and also in the classic series please watch the episode serial the keeper of the traken, the master also resolve the problem of going past the regeneration limit in that episode as well, so please stop complaining and picking apart the hows and whys of going past the limit of regenerations it's already been done more than once pay attention please. as far as the episode the day of the doctor mentioning redundant details, please remember that this was a special event shown in movie theaters, opening the series to a potential market of people who may have never seen the show before, therefore the possible need a redundant ex position for those people who may have never seen the show. finally, as for complaints about silly things dead plot parts like the doctor flying through space falling out of the TARDIS, remember that were just basically trying to have some fun! Isn't that what part of the series is about? in addition to that it also has a rather clever device which does what science fiction does best explore deep moral questions about what it means to be a sentient being, such as a human, for those of you who are out there for you may or may not qualify as sentient, the moment has a conscience, and it is a device to make the plot more meaningful by asking questions such as how do we as human beings deal with important moral questions that have impact on the lives of many people? so the episode is doing that, trying to make it fun, trying to appeal to a potential new baseof fans, as well as being the only anniversary episode to ever try to write all of the regeneration of the doctor into the plot line. to try to get all that in a meaningful and entertaining way is quite a piece of work. so for those of you were complaining, if you really are fans do a bit of homework and think about the previous episodes that explain the problems that you think ar problems now, and just relax! remember at the end this is supposed to be something that is imaginative meaningful and most of all fun! don't spoil that fun by arguing about little points that aren't relevant anyway this episode was great!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|GAME IS JAMMED....<br /><br />This game is jammed and has been for several day. I am on Level 30 and tried to purchase color bombs from the Amazon store. The purchase will not go through and I cannot remove it from the screen. Air message &#34;Still waiting for an answer from the Amazon Store...&#34;
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|good app. does what is needed. quick and easy to use. even reminds you to clean your junk files regularly.
B003NFM3JU|5.0|To my this is the best remake of the Christmas Carol.  The computer graphics are amazing and you will end up watching this over and over again and never be bored.  In fact, there are parts that will amaze you.  A great movie for the kids!
B004LPLU4K|1.0|The original was dark and creepy until the garden was found.Did not like the young actress either,she dident act spoiled enough.
B00027JYLC|5.0|This movie will truly test you.  The characters in the movie are real people with birth defects and yet they aren't mistreated at all.  Just the opposite, the story line shows how some people take advantage of their disabilities, but the movie does a great job of showing you each character and person as just that people.<br /><br />I would prescreen before I show to younger viewers, as the reality of the actors/actresses with their disabilities can be a lot for a young mind.  Be prepared to explain further about the different disabilities each of them have.  A good suspense movie and I highly recommend it for two reasons.  One its a good movie, second, it helps you see that there are actually people alive today coping and living with these disabilities and that displays to us that there is nothing we can't overcome.  A must have for your collection.
B005MMY9A8|3.0|Good - not great.  Several plot elements were lacking development - including the love story with Portman.  I'll be checking in on the 2nd entry soon.
B004GF244K|5.0|Love this DVD!  The band played all George's music perfectly and a true tribute to the greatest Beatle in my opinion.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|this is such a great book. I have been r reading Stephen King since I was about 16. my favorite book was \\"It\\" .. I can say that this, under the dome, the gunslinger books, and every book I've read is awesome..Stephen King is by far, my favorite writer..master of his art! I would totally recommended this tho anyone that loves these kind of stories..AAA+++
B0084AYLK8|3.0|I honestly think the movie helped you feel the characters emotions better. I generally like books better but they did a great job on the movie.
B0035LMTZA|4.0|Great action movie.  Must listen with a home theater system.  Great movie.  I have watched over and over and I still enjoy the movie.
B00GH4R95C|3.0|Great action and story, dialog was a little lacking, and it felt like it was dragging on at the end.
0385537131|5.0|A gift for my wife who is a great Grisham fan, it was well received and read cover-to-cover in very short order.  Now, it's my turn.
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|Excellent &#34;Cinderello&#34; story, yet not particularly profound.<br />A wonderful pedagogical tool for the French classroom.<br />Less Woody than I am used to, but an unpretentious sample of &#34;Castigat ridendo mores.&#34;
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|Everything about this set is perfect for any Breaking Bad fan and collector. The blu rays are held within hard plastic cases that when combined form a hidden image, the barrel itself is sturdy and hold everything perfectly. The piece de resistance is definitely the collectors coin that is included. If you enjoyed the show this is the collection for you and has plenty of bonus material that will keep you busy for some time.
B000IZ1HP4|5.0|BEST WESTERN MOVIE MADE SO FAR. I think I've watched all the decent western movies. I love them, but in my opinion, Once Upon A time In The West is the BEST.  Camera, Actors and acting, Clothing, Places, Music, Suspense, etc. etc.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|One of the best apps on the market! First computer, now this!  Everyone should get this amazing app! You Rule!!! : )
B003JA5NUA|5.0|Gilmore Girls is excellent. I started watching from season one and have been in love ever since. The characters are vivid and they all have a unique personality which adds to the warmth and charm of the show. Kirk has to be my favorite. There is not a moment you won't laugh when he's in a scene and Michel is second running on that. I recommend this to anyone who loves live wit and fast paced talking.
B00GX50BD2|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by how engaging this movie was.  My husband, a tech geek, really wanted to watch it and I figured I'd sit in for the beginning.  I ended up really getting into it.  Ashton Kutcher really did a great job portraying Steve Jobs.  He has the walk down perfectly and even his facial expressions were classic Steve Jobs.  I really enjoyed the first part of the movie, seeing how Apple Computers got off the ground and started a technical revolution.  The movie definitely gets darker as you see the change in Jobs after he becomes successful and takes the company public.  He really was not a very likeable guy.  There is a big skip in time between when he is taken off the board of Apple and when he finally returns.  You don't get to see what it is that changes his mind set and way of life, but he comes back a much calmer and more amiable person.  There is no doubt that Steve Jobs was a genius and this movie gives you a glimpse into how this legendary man evolved from an unfocused hippie in the 1970's to a driven perfectionist of a CEO in later years.  If you enjoy biopics or if you are intrigued by the mythical figure of Steve Jobs, this is definitely worth a watch.
B001G9LVGG|5.0|Loreena never disappoints. I love how she finds the old carols that no one sings anymore and then manages to make them beautiful.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Exciting, cant wait to read the final book, will but it immediately. Hope to hace the time to read it soon.
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|Loreena is still amazing.  I love that she sang all the old songs that most have forgotten.  I'm sorry that she didn't include lyrics with this one but it is still top notch.
B000QR1BTQ|5.0|Great for relaxing!  My yoga teacher used to play this in class and now I use it during my yoga practice.
B00CRS5HII|5.0|Great CD!, This is his third solo effort and they just get better with every release. Apparently I need 4 more words, but I really don't have much more to say, other than great CD
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I enjoy playing this game, it works well on my Kindle Fire and it passes the time quickly for me.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|I wanted a good basic, black cover for my Kindle Fire. This has been a great cover. I particularly like the elastic strap closure and the ability to stand the kindle up on its side.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am addicted!  This game is fun although it is slightly different from the Facebook game, I think I have my husband hooked on it now.
B00F880BWG|5.0|Stories are awesome, acting is superb.  It keeps your interest, and is very entertaining.  This is some of the best TV ever!
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|ADD me, farm ID: fauvzkx<br /><br /> Fun game. Super addictive, the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because they consistently ask you to spend real money, certain objects you kind of get tricked into buying with coins then you have to finish building them with actual money which is kind of annoying
B003B02O0A|5.0|I am rereading this novel from many years ago before I read Sycamore Row, a sequel of sorts.  I forgot how much I enjoyed it the first time. I heard Grisham in an interview recently and he said this was his first and his favorite novel.  He couldn't get it published as an unknown novelist but later did when his subsequent books became so popular.
B0074MZSWW|3.0|I bought this on a recommendation from a friend and found my response to be a bit conflicted.  They are obviously talented at mimicking Blues bands from yesteryear however, they write good songs so that makes it Ok.  After 60 years of Rock, Soul and R&B no band sounds truly original anymore.  They play well and their singer has a very good voice.<br /><br />My main issues with the album are the truly terrible production.  I realize they were going for a lo-fi Garage sound, however, they are not a lo-fi Garage band.  They have a big sound so all they did was hamper the power of their material.  I have several friends who like this album but find it unlistenable so I know I'm not alone on this.  My only other problem with album is the constant religious overtones on this release.  I don't mind some of that on an album but it got to the point that I felt like this is a covert Christian Rock album in the same vein as the first Jars Of Clay release.  Petty, I know, but I was a little surprised by this, I just don't want to listen to desperate pleas to God every three minutes.<br /><br />They are talented though, so if you don't mind the production or suffocating religious references then it just might be for you.  It just wasn't to my taste.
B000AM4PBS|5.0|Got this as a gift and they loved it. Nice wood, and the front is glass not plastic. High quality box set
B00FQAZ7PW|5.0|Sirens is probably the best song on the album and in my opinion, one of the best PJ songs of the last 15 years. The rock tunes on the album are all good and hard hitting. The band really hasn't slowed down all that much since &#34;Ten&#34;, they have just moved musically and for the most part, its for the better.
B00005JCA9|5.0|Wonderful film, I am a Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant fan and the musical score is outstanding. The script is quirky, fun and, at the same time, touching.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! BUY IT NOW OR THE CREEPERS WILL GET YOU!!!!! &gt;:) THIS IS TRULY THE BEST GAME EVER!!!!
B0036TGT2A|4.0|The quality is good but as far as the DVD format, I think the special features menu could have been laid out a little bit better.
1742204147|4.0|I visited Japan back in 2000 for work and wish that I had of had this guidebook then.<br /><br />The guidebook does its best to cover ALL of Japan within one edition.  Japan like many countries would probably be better served by a series of guidebooks that could give the information needed for that region.<br /><br />Being a Lonely Planet guide there was a lot of stuff about outdoor activities which didn't directly appeal to me, but I did like the tips they gave for saving money and also the food tourism ideas.<br /><br />From reading other guides to Japan, it appears that LP has found some neat places overlooked by smaller guides. However, that comes at the price of a very &#34;heavy&#34; book which will weigh down your travel bag.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I have so much fun with this game I wish the  people that made this game would make a pink Dragon that would be so cool  you all should  try this game  l thank the people very much for this game
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|It felt like a novel and I couldn't stop reading, but the lessons in the book are practical and real.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Great headset but buy the wired version, i always have to keep these plugged in because there constantly beeping at me about a low battery
B004P4S4NM|5.0|Excellent CD, but you don't need a review from me to know that, look at the awards she has received.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Great game love it but the robots should not cost as much to buy and their upgrades in the end cost more than the original price of t he robot
B0074QGGK6|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone brave enough to try to do their own thing, or scared enough that they've considered quitting.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|Great game. The only thing I didn't like was the ads after you have played each game. I got it for free so I guess I will deal with it.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Because I thought it was very well done.  It made me think of my grandparents and great grandparents who came from a small village in Essex, England.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|ROBERT DOWNEY JR!  Nuff said!  This movie rocks!  Yes if you read the comics, the Mandarin WAS and still IS a disappointment, but ignore that and the movie is great!
