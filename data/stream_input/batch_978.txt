0375854819|2.0|I read eragon a couple of years ago and remember liking it.  Brisinger sucks.  It is so unrealistic in its desperation to be epic, that it just fails.  At one point this farmer kills like 400 enemy soldiers by himself or something. they all get in a nice neat line and he kills them over the course of a half a day? said the bodies stacked up like 20 feet.  Absolutely disgusting after having read the lord of the rings.  He steals almost all his ideas out of LOTR anyways and then distorts them horribly.  I couldn't finish this book.
0385737424|5.0|\\"When You Reach Me\\" is quite simply a beautifully written young adult novel.  The plot focuses on the trials and tribulations of growing up, while keeping a realistic middle-school aged voice throughout.  So often characters in kids books sound too adult, but this novel is written in a believably youthful voice.  It's a quick read for anyone over the age of 14, but still entertaining even for adults (I'm in my mid-twenties and thoroughly enjoyed it).
B002JVWQSW|5.0|I originally decided to watch this show because I am a big Ed O'Neil fan, but exactly 1 minute into the show, I was already hooked. The cast is amazing, funny and very talented. I literally laugh for 30 straight minutes every time I watch this show. I do think the male cast members are funnier than the female cast members, but that's not to put down anyone on the show. But the scenes with Phil, Cam, Mitchell, Jay and Manny are always hilarious. Non stop laughs and fun for the entire family !! BUY this on DVD...you will not be sorry.....and watch the show on ABC. This is one show that needs to be around for years.
B001GCUO5M|4.0|Filled with surreal imagery, supported by strong performances from Leonardo DiCaprio, Ben Kingsley, Mark Ruffalo, the marvelous Max Von Sydow and Jackie Early Haley \\"Shutter Island\\" has some magnificent moody movements and while it isn't great Scorsese it is very good indeed. A mystery thriller based on Dennis Lehane's (GONE BABY GONE)novel the moody mystery revolves around a patient that has simply vanished from an island for the criminally insane and the pair of federal marshals Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio)a troubled veteran of World War II still disturbed by the images he saw when he helped liberate a German concentration camp and his new partner Chuck Aule (Ruffalo) trying to determine why they are being stonewalled about her disappearance. It's clear from the beginning to Daniels that the staff at the isolated hospital seems to be hiding something the trouble is that everything seems to be hiding in plain sight. On the surface they get cooperation but it's also quite clear that there are members of the staff and even some of the patients that have been carefully rehearsed to hide something.<br /><br />While \\"Shutter Island\\" isn't among the best films that Scorsese has made it does demonstrate what a talented film director can do with good source material. At turns spooky and suspense \\"Shutter Island\\" probably could have been trimmed about 10 minutes. The main flaw of the film is that it doesn't pander to its audience by using rapid fire editing techniques to generate an artificial feeling of suspense and unease instead relying on craftsmanship and strong, intelligent performances by the performers in the film. Keep in mind that \\"Shutter Island\\" is an example of a slow, moody thriller and, in many respects, is a throwback to the type of thrillers we might have seen in the 70's (which isn't a surprise given that Scorsese came of age as a film director during that time). Don't expect the rapid fire editing of \\"Final Destination\\" or linear narrative of most contemporary films. \\"Shutter Island\\" has more in common with \\"Memento\\" or Chris Nolan's mixed genre thriller \\"The Prestige\\" than \\"The Bourne Identity\\". I'd also note that the film is a moody homage to Hitchcock's thrillers.<br /><br />Scorsese has never been a director that has focused on complex plots (although there are exceptions in his career but those exceptions have usually been when he's been paired with a strong writing collaborator) as much as complex characters. Perhaps that's the Achilles' heel of \\"Shutter Island\\" as the occasionally careens out of control as we watch Teddy dig deeper and deeper into the mystery that drives him to want to discover the evil at the heart of \\"Shutter Island\\". Working with the novel's strong more conventional narrative may have been too much a challenge for the director and his creative visuals. Nevertheless even if he does stumble the film manages to hold together fairly well and continues to be entertaining. Fans of the novel, suspenseful mystery thrillers, DiCaprio and Scorsese will still find much to admire and the last sequence in the film still cuts deeply.<br /><br />The conclusion of the film particularly the last dialogue exchange between DiCaprio and Ruffalo validates the film. Scorsese makes \\"Shutter Island\\" a suspenseful thriller that echoes some of Hitchcock's classic psychological thrillers (particularly \\"Vertigo\\" in its stylized look)producing a film that isn't afraid to look into the abyss of a lost soul in fear that the abyss might look back.. \\"Shutter Island\\" has more in common with \\"Memento\\" or Chris Nolan's mixed genre thriller \\"The Prestige\\" than \\"The Bourne Identity\\".

1400052173|3.0|The author has set herself a difficult task here, toggling back and forth between the history and the science of the harvesting of Henrietta Lacks's cells and their importance to research and discovery, and the human story of Henrietta Lacks's children, uneducated, poor, without health insurance, some criminal, and all without a cent to show for the billions that have been made from the marketing of their mother's cells.  Does author Skloot succeed?  Only about halfway.  The science can be hard going for a general audience.  Skloot does somewhat better presenting the legal and philosophical arguments for and against the use of human tissue in medical research without the consent of or compensation to the human donor.  The book gets bogged down in what should be its most accessible part: the tale of Henrietta's family.  Skloot was constantly threatened with being cut off from access to the Lacks family, and it shows.  There's not a whisper of outrage here about a fourteen-year-old's impregnation by the nineteen-year-old cousin with whom she'd shared a bedroom since she was four; and while Skloot does say, quietly, that Henrietta's husband-that same cousin--brought \\"bad blood\\" (syphilis) home to her from other women, and much later acknowledges quietly that the cervical cancer that killed her was sexually transmitted, she never lays the blame for Henrietta's death at her husband's feet and apparently never makes it plain to Henrietta's profoundly ignorant children that it was their father who ultimately caused their mother's death.  Narrative holes in the story aren't explained; Sonny Lacks's children appear to have sprung into existence without the medium of a mother; the only daughter of central figure Deborah Lacks all but vanishes from the story after her infancy.  We get, instead, an embarrassing and prolonged account of a laying-on-of-hands by a Lacks cousin.  This is Skloot's first book, and a dedicated editor who wasn't afraid of the Lacks family was needed.Should tissue be harvested from human donors without their consent, and, even if consent is given, should the donors be compensated?  The book explores that question in detail while appropriately leaving the difficult answer up to the reader.  What is plain, even in this uneven and somewhat undisciplined book, is that the uneducated, poor, inbred and syphilis-damaged Lacks family certainly could have used a cut of all that money that still is being made from the marketing of Henrietta's cells.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I don't agree at all with the review that perceived Anne as a meek person who \\"cries when anyone hurts her feelings\\" in this wonderful version. In this production, the director has Anne engage the viewer eye to eye at the close of many scenes really taking in and involving the reader in her plight and situation. We get to know her real feelings and reactions as if we are another person in the room with her, someone in whom she confides. POV of the camera is very important. One has to really pay attention to more than just the dialogue to appreciate this version. Anne is no wilting violet when it comes to helping her young cousin John when he fell from a tree, She is the most capable and clear thinking of the lot. Everyone turns to her for guidance. And when Louisa falls in Lyme, even Frederick does, understanding that Anne has made the transformation from girl to woman. I loved the scenes in Bath - how the director chose to pan along the long blocks of homes, how she literally has to run to change her fate. And in the kissing scene between Anne and Frederick, she is the one who has to come more than halfway to him in every sense of the word. This is a woman who understands that she has to show her determination. I loved the direction in this version and will watch it many times.

B00275EGWY|5.0|The Oscars are on Sunday, and \\"The Hurt Locker\\" seems to be the front runner. I'm not sure about that, but if it wins, I wouldn't complain. Katherine Bigelow's anti-war Iraq epic is loaded with suspense, fine acting, editing, script,  cinematography and all the stuff that makes an Oscar winner. It's never boring, and the characters each have an agenda. Interesting. Also interesting is that it made the rounds of indie film festivals in 2008. The 2008 Indie Spirits nominated it for 2 awards: Jeremy Renner as Best Actor, and Anthony Mackie as Best Supp Actor. No mention of Ms. Bigelow, or Best Picture. I'm going out on a limb here, but I think Ms Bigelow will win the Oscar for Director, but her ex-husband's film will win Best Picture (Avatar). The DVD has lots of extras, and Ms Bigelow has a tremendous amount of personal \\"touch\\" that I think is solely responsible for its power. Jeremy Renner is certainly capable, but it's Jeff Bridges' turn to win...and, in this case, it's not just Oscar politics. Enuff...only my opinion.  UPDATE: I think the Oscars got it right. Maybe there should be a new category of Best CGI film. I DO enjoy when small Indie films beat out the studio big-shots.
B002WY65VU|5.0|This movie is great! Specially if your a zombie killer gamer (left for dead) then this movie is for you! and the rules are hilarious. I kind of apply them in real life lol.<br />The DVD came in good packaging so no worries. If you like killing zombies this movie is for you.
B001QOGYFO|5.0|This movie has great twists and turns, and a great plot.  You don't know who it is until the end.  Highly recommend.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|A restrained Tarintino is a beautiful thing (although an unrestrained one is pretty great too).  This movie was brilliant!  Each character was meticulously performed by great actors (although I'm not sure if Brad Pitt's accent was off on purpose or not...).  I know there was a 1970s exploitation film entitled [[ASIN:B00140PKCS The Inglorious Bastards]] that served as an inspiration but the plots are no where close.<br /><br />Here's an interesting premise on WWII - what if there was an elite American assassination squad made up of Jews who hunted down Nazis.  These men are to be feared.  Tarintino used restrained scenes of violence (compared to his other movies) that make it all the more shocking.  I closed my eyes for the scalping. So here you have this group of men pitted against the whole german army and one specifically, Landa or The Jew Hunter.  Landa is brilliantly played by Christoph Waltz who is up for an Oscar for this role and deserves one.  I tensed whenever he appeared on screen.  Bo Svenson, a star of the original Inglorious Bastards, has a part which is a nice nod from Tarintino.  Each character is magnificently acted no matter how small which helps make this movie shine.  Whoever casted this movie deserves lots of credit.  There are a few scenes with subtitles but don't let it scare you away.<br /><br />The movie is very suspenseful, the humor is droll and the plot zips along.  One of the best things for me?  The ending was very fitting.  I hate watching a great movie only to see it crumble at the end.  There was a cheesy moment (Soshanna and the hero in the screening room) but it was easily forgotten under the barrage of fascinating film making.  This is a great war movie which pays homage to all the greats before it.  I loved it and would highly recommend it.

B002OB9KPE|5.0|A fabulous composition and rock symphony.  The Whirlwind flows beautifully for an entire CD with great lyrics and melodies.  These guys are among the best composers in music today.  They won't be noticed by the pop/rock industry, but they are a treasure worth finding by anyone interested in progressive rock.  It's heavily influenced by Neal Morse, which probably gives it the fantastic flowing continuity throughout the 12 \\"songs\\" on the main CD.  In reality, the songs are movements in the symphony and the main themes keep returning to bring together the parts perfectly.  Buy it, try it, pass it along for a friend to hear; you won't regret the experience.

B001KPK6Q2|1.0|As one of my patients said the other day, \\"am I the only one who notices that Taylor Swift cannot sing?\\"<br /><br />When I first heard this girl on TV a couple years back, I thought I was catching a parody show.  Surely no one singing that poorly and off-key was being serious.  Of course now I know she is, indeed, singing \\"seriously\\" and that there was no joke intended.  The Grammy Awards, obviously, aren't handed out based on talent.  They are given each year to singers who-- usually due to being most heavily promoted-- have received popularity and high sales.  (A quick review into previous years' winners show an unfortunate tendency to award \\"artists\\" who later fizzle out as one-hit wonders.  Check for yourself-- the list of winners is hilarious in hindsight.)<br /><br />That said, it's still sad that the public will continue to think they like someone based on that person being marketed and shoved down their throat incessantly.  \\"You say Taylor Swift is the new big thing?  Oh... ok.... hey, yeah, I like her!  And I think she's SOOOOO talented!\\"  I do find some humor in the album's title.  Surely this young woman IS quite fearless in her willingness to stand in front of people and sing her heart out when hitting the notes is such a struggle. Not everyone has a set of pipes to write home about, but 9 out of 10 people in the room can remain on key singing Happy Birthday.  Taylor Swift will always be that 10th person in the room, always not quite hitting the notes, but doing her best to try, anyway.  Bless her heart for tryin', this fearless little thing, but good lord, what a painful experience for the rest of us who aren't tone deaf.  I look forward to the day her 15 minutes are up.
B002KV8NQ0|5.0|I first saw Imelda May performing with Jeff Beck at the Grammys doing \\"How High the Moon\\". I was blown away and couldn't get her out of my mind until I found her on YouTube. I immediatly bought her \\"Love Tattoo\\" CD. It was my non- stop for two solid days! I hadn't enjoyed a CD so much in years! She does new original material in Rockabilly style, very nice slow ballads, and some remakes of 60's classics. Leaving me wanting more, I found she had an earlier CD called \\"No Turning Back\\" I ordered it and to my surprise, it is as good as \\"Love Tattoo\\". Give her a listen, you won't be sorry. If you look for her on YouTube, listen to Big Bad Handsome Man, Johnny got a Boom Boom, Meet You at the Moon, and Falling in Love with You Again for a good sampling. And of course, if your on YoutTube, check out her Grammy performance with Jeff Beck, incredible!

B002YMWPUA|4.0|It seems false to say that \\"Hunger\\" dramatizes the events surrounding the hunger strike of Irish Republican Bobby Sands in the Maze Prison that made news around the world in 1981. Steve McQueen's film does not so much dramatize the bizarre conditions and battle of wills inside the Maze as it shows them to us. \\"Hunger\\" is a film of images with very little dialogue. It's fantastically cinematic, until, about halfway through, it is interrupted by a 22 minute conversation between Sands (Michael Fassbender) and Catholic priest Father Dominic Moran (Liam Cunningham) in which the IRA radical and the moderate Catholic lay out their conflicting views of how Irish Republicans should proceed. An almost entirely aural experience in the middle of a highly visual film.<br /><br />By 1981, over 2,000 people had been killed in \\"The Troubles\\" in Northern Ireland, as republicans and unionists battled over the future of British rule, and the British tried to keep the peace while tending to support the unionists. The Maze prison housed 75 IRA militants who were convicted of crimes. When we enter the prison in 1981, they're on a \\"blanket\\" and \\"no wash\\" strike. They refuse to wear prison uniforms, so they go naked except for a blanket, and they refuse to bathe or cut their hair. They smear excrement all over their cell walls and destroy their accommodations as best they can to protest their status as prisoners, while the prison officers are forced to cope with this situation with varying degrees of passivity and force.<br /><br />\\"Hunger\\" doesn't give much hint of why the prisoners are protesting or what they hope to achieve with these actions or with the later hunger strikes. (They were trying to force the British government to recognize them as political prisoners rather than criminals.) Steve McQueen and co-writer Enda Walsh are more concerned with conveying the bizarre circumstances that leads to warped behavior on the part of both prisoners and guards, and its emotional toll. It is startling how clearly smells and tactile sensations come across through the use of images. Close-ups on detail, meticulous production design, and no distracting dialogue are a powerful combination. This sensory experience emphasizes the primitivism to which both sides of the conflict have resorted.<br /><br />Some say the IRA supported the hunger strikes to garner international support and improve their recruiting in Northern Ireland rather than out of concern for the political status of the prisoners. \\"Hunger\\" doesn't take a stance on British rule, IRA violence, or even whether Bobby Sands and his fellow strikers were delusional pawns or martyrs to a just cause. It contents itself with showing us the strange situation that the politics of Northern Ireland created inside the Maze prison at that time -and the deaths and damage to prisoners and prison officers that resulted. Steve McQueen has admirably combined the sensory impact of photographic art with the humanity that the actors bring to their roles to take the viewer inside a strange and disturbing conflict that played out nearly 30 years ago.<br /><br />The DVD (Criterion Collection 2010): There are 4 featurettes and a theatrical trailer (1 ½ min). \\"Steve McQueen\\" (17 min) interviews the director about how he uses the camera, contrast between the Maze and normal life, his research, and the film's reception. \\"The Making of Hunger\\" (14 min) interviews McQueen, writer Enda Walsh, producer Robin Gutch, and the cast. \\"Michael Fassbender\\" (14 min) is a 2008 interview by film critic Jason Solomons about preparing to play Bobby Sands and making the movie. \\"The Provos' Last Card?\\" (45 min) is a segment from the BBC news program \\"Panorama\\" in 1981. Journalist Peter Taylor looks at the political situation in Northern Ireland through interviews with Sinn Fein, Democratic Unionist, and Labour Party leaders, and others. This is helpful in understanding the political situation surrounding the hunger strikes if you are not British or Irish and need some education on the subject.ation on the subject.
B0002TKFR2|5.0|I have always been an admirer of Heifetz because of his unparalleled technique and gorgeous sound.  Despite the accusation of being \\"cold\\", which  had to do mostly with his unemotional platform behavior, many of his performances are  heartfelt.  That said, the Mendelssohn is about my least favorite Heifetz concerto recording.  It is quite brisk, to say the least.  And yes, it sounds kind of cold to me.  The Mendelssohn is a beautiful, romantic work that works really well when the soloist gives it a bit of space here and there to sing, even in the finale.  Heifetz plays it straight and fast all the way through, to the work's detriment.  Heifetz's ultra quick finale is a tour de force for sure, but there are other violinists I like better.  Gil Shaham is great in this concerto precisely because he gives the music a little more time to bloom, if you will.      The Beethoven is far, far better.  The 2nd and 3rd movements are wonderful.  The second movement is really moving, with an almost magical beauty, and the finale moves happily along at a quick, appropriate pace.  The first movement is brilliantly played, and the SACD recording restores the power and heft to the sound of the tuttis, as well as offering a marvelous sound picture of the unique Heifetz tone.  For all my admiration for the quality of the playing in the 1st movement, it does have a frenetic feel in places, with a quick overall tempo aggravated by some rushing in a few isolated passages.  Most other violinists (Perlman, Szeryng, Oistrakh, Francescatti, Kreisler, Krebbers, Repin, etc etc) take 23 to 26 minutes for the first movement.  Jascha and Charles polish it off in 20'34\\" flat.   My opinion is that the 1st movement would be for the ages had they slowed just a bit, to say 22'.  As it is, it's still magnificent, but unnervingly quick in spots.    As for the sound, this latest incarnation of the recording is superb--warm, full, brilliant, detailed and well balanced.  The first CD incarnation of these performances in the 80s was kind of awful, but this one holds up fine against modern digital recordings. Actually, it sounds better than some.  The Mendelssohn is a bit dry, but the Beethoven has to my ears an ideal amount of reverberation to add glow to the sound.   The 1st movement cadenza in Beethoven is thrilling to hear in SACD. The man's virtuosity was staggering.    Despite my reservations about the Mendelssohn, 5 stars because of the Beethoven.  The recording is worth the price for the slow movement of the Beethoven alone!    Buy it.

B0035J6TAI|1.0|I would like to thank Amazon for posting the complete songs for this travesty of a CD so I could avoid wasting my money on it. Seriously, PG should be embarrassed for releasing this garbage. He sounds like someone singing off key and in a whisper while taking a shower or driving a car. There is no fluid match between his awkward phrasing and the music itself. It's painful to listen. Does anyone at his Real World Studios have the guts to tell him he's nuts for letting this junk see the light of day? Apparently not.    If this is the best he can do, then PG should re-up with Genesis and do a \\"Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\\" tour.
B001GQSY5K|3.0|Reviews for this movie seem to fall into two distinct categories, the five-star 'my six-year-old loves it' category and the one-star 'this is the biggest pile of rubbish ever made and George Lucas should be tarred and feathered for allowing it to see the light of day' category. I fall squarely in the middle on this one. Is it the greatest Star Wars film ever made? Absolutely not. Is it the biggest pile of rubbish ever? Not really.     It just is what it is--a modestly budgeted feature length cartoon designed to appeal to viewers, primarily male, under the age of 12. The animation technique is visually engaging and the story line is somewhat simplistic with fairly predictable plot twists. But taken in the spirit with which it is intended, it does work and it does do more than stitch one battle sequence to the next.     This film was never intended to be on par with the six live action Star Wars films that preceded it, nor was it intended as a season blockbuster. Although it was a theatrical release, Star Wars: The Clone Wars was really just a pilot for a TV series that was already in the process of being made. The idea of kicking the series off with a feature film was almost an afterthought. Although it performed only modestly at the box office, Lucasfilm and Warner deemed it a success in that it met their expectations. It should be noted that this film's release through Warner instead of Fox had nothing to do with its quality. It was a Warner project from the 'git-go'. The Clone Wars TV series was being produced for Cartoon Network, which is owned by Warner; therefore, it stands to reason that Warner would release the feature film.     If you can avoid having unrealistic expectations about this film, you will probably be able to enjoy it for what it is without disappointment, anger, or resentment over what it isn't.

Rather than recreating caricatures of the supporting cast, believability marks all of the portrayls.  I especially love Romola Garai as Emma.  Wonderful choice.  And who wouldn't love Jonny Lee Miller as Mr. Knightley?  The length (4hrs) allows for faithful adherence to Jane Austen's story without having to butcher important side stories.  I'm so glad I bought it.

B00005JJX8|4.0|This 1955 film is Hitchcock's adventure into romantic comedy, or as one critic called it, \\"romantic thriller.\\"  I can see that!<br /><br />The story is apparently about a man who used to be a jewel and diamond thief but after the war and his heroics there in the French Underground, has retired from being a cat burglar (The Cat) and lives in a fancy house with servants in the French Riviera.  Someone is copying him, stealing jewels just as he did with  his methods.  The other thief is so good that many people, even his own comrades and the police, think he is doing it.<br /><br />But that plotline is fake!  It's actually about John Robie (Cary Grant) and Francie (Grace Kelly, in her final movie before moving to Monaco), their exploration of romance and expressions of their love.<br /><br />The film has all the requisite items in a Hitchcock stew:  take a man with a mistaken identity, put in a dash of rich blondes driving fancy cars (very fast, actually) and stir in the atmosphere of the French Riviera.<br /><br />But I think the soup has a bit too many items in it!  I mean, it is intriguing to watch Grant as he tries to clear his name and how he tries to pick up on Kelly's character at the same time.  But the film drags a bit.<br /><br />Take the masquerade scene where Francie helps set up a trap to catch the real thief.  Many couples traipsing in with their gorgeous ball gowns and 18th century costumes really drags -- but at the same time is an awesome showcase of Edith Head's costuming, the famous movie costumer working at Paramount at the time.<br /><br />I did enjoy the double entendre (\\"Would you prefer a leg or a breast?\\") when discussing picnic chicken; or how Grace Kelly's character is driving down a narrow road, hairpin turns at 90 miles an hour with a sly grin on her face; or even better, the fireworks going off between kisses!<br /><br />The DVD I rented had a lot of great \\"making of\\" treasures, including interviews with Hitchcock's daughter Pat and his granddaughter Mary Stone.  A pretty funny story was told where Mary was studying film and one of Hitchcock's films was one of the subjects (I forget which one, Stranger on a Train I think) and Hitch helped her write a paper on what the director was trying to say in the film.<br /><br />Another tidbit was that Cary Grant was not going to act in anymore pictures until convinced to work on \\"Thief\\".  To think, if Cary got his wish, we never would have seen him on North by Northwest and others.<br /><br />The paper came back a \\"C\\"!  Hitchcock saw this and said, \\"Well, I did my best!\\"<br /><br />Family photos of the Hitchcock family, trailers, interviews with the cast and crew from To Catch a Thief, and a very interesting bio of Edith Head gave awesome film history to anyone interested in the men and women behind the camera.<br /><br />To Catch a Thief has its moments, but does not measure up to his other hits such as Rear Window or North by Northwest.  Recommended.<br /><br />Some Cary Grant Films:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0001WTWYW The Cary Grant Signature Collection (Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House / Destination Tokyo / The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer / My Favorite Wife / Night and Day)]]<br />[[ASIN:B001KXZGNW TCM Greatest Classic Films Collection: Romantic Comedies (Adam's Rib / Woman of the Year / The Philadelphia Story / Bringing Up Baby)]]<br /><br />Some Grace Kelly Films:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000RETP0K The Hollywood Collection - Grace Kelly: The American Princess]]<br />[[ASIN:B000GETTIY The Leading Ladies Collection (Now Voyager / Mildred Pierce / For Me and My Gal / Father of the Bride / Dial M for Murder)]]y was told where Mary was studying film and one of Hitchcock's films was one of the subjects (I forget which one, Stranger on a Train I think) and Hitch helped her write a paper on what the director was trying to say in the film.

B001DDBCUU|5.0|Movie came packaged properly and DVD looks brand new.  No scratches or marks.  Shipping took much longer than anticipated, however.
0312323867|5.0|This was a beautifully written book about a woman figuring out who she wants to be, and who she really is. It's much more than the usual girl-meets-boy, fall in love after a long haul of not liking each other story. Although the plotline sounds like any other woman's novel, the characters are much more developed and three-dimensional. This is a great book that stands on its own, however, I recommend reading \\"Something Borrowed\\" first. The Darcy character explains the story from the previous book only to back up the decisions she makes in this book.  It's more powerful because the reader gets Rachel's perspective first in \\"Something Borrowed\\" so the reader can understand the evolution of Darcy's character. In each book the author portrays a distinctive voice and personality in each narrator. The reader gets a sense of Darcy as the difficult character she was so that when she finally grew up and evolved the contrast was evident and truly moving. This is a very enjoyable read!
6305922756|5.0|and clever and relevant and probably spot on in regards to how some people in the music and entertainment industry act.i loved the British accents ,and some of the gags are just too funny.the motley mix of characters are also great.the music actually isn't too bad sometimes,though i suspect that's probably unintentional.usually it's dog awful,and very funny which i think it's supposed to be.for a movie that's a quarter century old,you'd think it would feel dated,but i didn't think so at all.a lot of that is probably due to the writing of Christopher Guest and Michael McKean.for me,This is Spinal Tap is a well deserved 4.6/5
B0024RIMBG|5.0|I forst saw this performance on Television (PBS) and knew I HAD to have it. The romantic setting of Slane Castle in Ireland coupled with the clear voices of Chloe Agnew, Hayley Westenra, Lisa Kelly, Meav Ni  Mhaolchath, and Orla Fallon with the incredible instrumentation of Mairead Nesbitt on fiddle, makes for a winning combination.   I can promise you that if you like Irish music this DVD is a \\"must\\" for your collection and it's one performance that you and your family will enjoy over and over again.
0783219695|5.0|i remember watching this film eons ago,and thinking it was horrible.in fact,i even fell asleep while watching it.however,i decided to revisit it a few days ago and had the exact opposite reaction.this time,i thought it was brilliant.i thought the story flowed perfectly,and the tension mounted at just the right tempo and hung there until the very end.the acting was spot on.and the music added the perfect atmosphere.i haven't seen too many Ron Howard film's,but this is one of the best that i have seen of his.i would encourage anyone who hasn't seen it to check it out.who knows,you might be surprised,for me Apollo 13 is a 4.6/5
B000A2W1X2|5.0|Although I agree with all the reviews I have read that this is a great movie it does force you to deal with some issues that may make some uncomfortable. I'm not going to go over them as it would spoil the movie, but be prepared to really suspend belief or rather judgment. Every one of the actors & actresses in this move do a fantastic job of making this movie watchable, especially Ms Marceau who is both talented & beautiful. Her range is fairly broad considering the work she has done i.e. from Bond villanese to Shakespeare's Hypolitta & she certainly pulls this movie together by being a kind of Maypole that everyone else moves around. This movies also runs your emotions an Olympic mile, so this one isn't for the faint of heart.
0307454541|5.0|Wow, what a strange, riveting book...plot and characters all deliciously complex and the pace quite galloping. At least two nights, I stayed up way past my bedtime because I couldn't put it down. Intrigue, dysfunction, macabre scenarios, religion, sex, occult, murder, fraud, high level electronic espionage...amazing.
0307271862|5.0|There may be other mysteries that can traverse four continents and three centuries and hold you riveted to your seat, but I have not yet found them. Like the now classic [[ASIN:0307454541 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Vintage)]] this tale from Sweden grabs you in the first pages and never lets go.    A Swedish judge Birgitta Roslin is inadvertently drawn into an investigation of the murder of nineteen residents of a tiny northern hamlet, where here mother had previously lived with a foster family. Stumbling across some old letters and diaries in her mother's foster home, she begins to peel away the layers of truth from supposition surrounding the massacre. The police are not impressed, preferring their own inadequate solutions to the crime, but Roslin presses on, ultimately traveling to China where The Man from Beijing has set into motion a series of events that will produce horrific murders in Europe, Africa, and North America.    Great murder mysteries are always about something else besides murder. In this case the something else includes an engaging reflection on the Chinese Communist Revolution and its present reality, as well as the loss of youthful idealism both in the west and in China. The former Red Guards in China and their formerly youthful admirers in western Europe are coping in very different ways with the charged world of the 21st century. But no matter how much change as come for good, malice and delusion continue to bring evil to the planet.     Henning Mankell has brought us something great in from the cold. Enjoy it at your leisure.
0385504225|3.0|Well, Dan Brown has stuck to his formula and taken us on another rollicking and exhausting adventure (a year's worth of action in less than 24 hours)with Harvard symbologist Robert Landon as he managed to get himself in the crosshairs of both the CIA and a demented psychopath. The psychopath thinks Langdon can help him find an ancient Masonic symbol hidden somewhere in Washington, DC. He wants it to achieve ultimate wisdom and power he believes are promised in Ancient Wisdom writings passed down through the elite leadership of the Masonic order. He has kidnapped Masonic leader and Langdon mentor, Peter Solomon, and Langdon, in concert with Peter's scientist sister, Katherine, must try to stay ahead of the killer and find their own answers to the puzzle.<br /><br />What redeems this otherwise unlikely drama is the interesting weaving of supposedly factual information about the Masons, their secrets and hidden history, and a tantalizing array of theological and mystical truths and legends about symbols, mathematical puzzles and riddles, and the role they played in the lives of actual people such as George Washington, Isaac Newton, Leonardo da Vinci, and others.<br /><br />If you liked the Da Vinci code, you'll probably like this too.

0786891084|5.0|This book is about a best friend duo, Alex and Rosie.  You read them grow up and realize maybe they should be a couple but the timing is never quite right, all while other things happen to change the course of their lives.  What is interesting about this book is that it is entirely letters, postcards, emails, IMs etc rather than the normal writings of a fiction book.  At first I found it really strange but ended up loving it.  Aherns tells a good story with out droning on and on and on with unnecessary detail like some authors end up doing.  You are just given a good story with out all the fill.  It is a light read, nothing that will change your life or anything.  I would give the story five stars in a light reading catagory and five stars for original, unique concept!
0316010669|5.0|Having taken sociology as a minor in college, I personally found this book to be quite intriguing as Malcom Gladwell did an outstanding job in explaining and providing examples of how people react with one another or find themselves in certain situations from the perspective of utilizing the unconscious portion of one's mind. Simply put, the title of his book, says it all! His scientific approach to rapid cognition, along with other studies such as the race IAT, will leave you dumbfounded as you try to attempt to either shape, confirm, or deny your own opinion of how your perceive people of different races when you associate them with different words. I have always loved learning about people, social groups, and knowing why people behave or respond they way they do with other people and/or other cultures. This book just takes it a step further by explaining how people's rapid intuitiveness and instant judgment often provides a more accurate conclusion than what they would have otherwise spent large amounts of time thinking about only to surface with poor judgment aka the wrong answer/solution (in some cases....not all). If anything, this book will make you a bit more life smart/people smart/street smart in being more mindful and understanding of how people behave and make judgments...especially when judgments occur in the BLINK of an eye!
B002UNMWAG|5.0|As the filmmakers stated numerous times in the supplements, at Comic Con and in the media, this film is for the fans and I think they made a nice homage to that cause.<br /><br />It did not get a wide release as it appears this was more about getting it into the hands of all those that enjoy this franchise instead. The story contains plenty of guns, slow-mo action, graceful footage of a beautiful Fed, and redemption. The BD preserves the picture and DTS sound perfectly. The clarity is solid throughout and the channels are given plenty of usage from beginning to end. The supplements are outstanding and include:<br /><br />* Deleted scenes. Very short and only last a couple minutes. Would have been nice to see Benz' emotions in the film for the character that gets killed but oh well.<br />* Behind the scenes, 25:40 minutes. A fan piece all the way that covers everything that one might ask about in making this franchise continue. Always plenty of F bombs to keep the entertainment up.<br />* Connelly/Duffy sit down, 9:15 minutes. Funny and relevant regarding these two; how they met, the creation process and plenty of humorous moments.<br /><br />Exclusive to BD:<br /><br />* Secrets from the set, 7:10 minutes. More behind the scenes interviews and fun clips.<br />* Weapons, 8:22 minutes. Completely worth every second if you are into the guns. Covers both films.<br />* Comic Con, 60 minutes. Footage from the convention last year. Covers signings, the sit down and some fun snippets before they arrive. (Nice Ron Jeremy visit).<br /><br />I do not feel one should be disappointed in the overall product in any way, and I think the critics of this picked apart stuff just to do it. Yes, there are plenty of things to say were done incorrectly, but when that final plot twist hits, it makes me look forward to the next film that much more. 5 stars for everything.
B001KZI2WW|4.0|I was out in a mall looking at crocs shoes. The salesman said the shoes would mold to your feet and get softer and softer and you could wear them all day with comfort.<br />  The Santa Cruz was the one the salesman said was best of all crocs shoes.<br />It was my least favorite. I did not know the beach had come out in 2002 and had been a national craze.<br /> I got the canvas version made in Mexico. Crocs have companies in both china and Mexico.<br />  The shoe is only two parts. It has a cheap canvas outer part with a small sole. It has a large insole made of the crocs mold material. My version had arch support. The canvas does not have any soft material for your heal protection nor any midsole material. I wore socks with the shoe so I would have some protection from the canvas.<br />  The first test was to wear them to work. I had heard of nurses wearing crocs to work 12 hours at time.<br />  I have a sit down job but after 8 hours I had many sore muscles that I was not used to using. The mold material affects different muscles in the leg. The insole did not feel too bad inside the building walking around but it does not offer much support just getting out of the car on the ground.<br />  How do the shoes hold up in a short walk?<br />  On a walk around the block the canvas bleed heavily over my socks. The forefoot support was weak but the large insole did offer some support.<br />  Did the insole mold too my foot? I could not tell if the insole molder or not but the insole did not get softer and softer the more I wore them.<br />  Next test was to take the insole out and try in a running shoe. This idea does not work as the mold material does not make a good insole. That idea fails.<br /> Because to the lack of support this is not a good shoe for walking. Inside the house the shoe seems ok but it the salesman had not pushed me so hard on this model I would have gotten one of the leather models. The leather model would be a better house shoe but there are still other shoes that would be as good or much better.<br />  The only value of the shoe is the value of the mold insole. I do not think it lives up to its hype. It can not be used like Power step, super feet, or soft sole insoles.<br /> I do like the idea behind the mold insole and think the concept has some value.<br /> The company today has fallen on very bad times from their 2006 release into the stock market. They almost went broke last year.<br /> I tried to return my crocs. I had the hardest time of my life trying to return them. It took me 90 minutes to return them. It took three salespeople to process taking the shoes back. The company had some very tough policies that even the salespeople could not process a return.<br /> After calls to the home office and a few other details they processed the return.<br />  The company has a lot of problems.<br />The shoe does not make it as it stands today.<br /> I still have not tried the beach shoe so I do not know how this technology works in their other shoes.<br />I raised my ranking on these shoes. I ended up with two pair of these. One too small and the other too large. They were different sizes. I have worn both heavy but I have to use each for different things. I have many other regular crocs but I never wore any of them. I have been wearing the larger size lately but I used to like the smaller one. I wore them out and finally got used to the larger ones but I could not tell you what size I would get next. I would have given 5 stars if either one had been the right size.

B001UJUGZO|3.0|Aside from all of the negative press around this film for years, I was hoping SMG could pull off a nice separation from her previous similar work ([[ASIN:B000M2E3H2 The Return (Widescreen Edition)]], and coupled with the screen presence of Lee Pace ([[ASIN:B001BPJJ82 The Fall (+ BD Live) [Blu-ray]]) - what could go wrong? Everything.<br /><br />The story takes place in San Francisco as the perfect couple (SMG, Michael Landes) live in bliss, they are accompanied by his felon brother (Lee Pace) while life plods along. To add \\"suspense\\" the camera flashed violent images with overamped music at you during various scenes. Finally, the bad event happens on one of the worst CGI Golden Gate Bridges you will ever see, and the brothers' bodies, lives and souls are changed/switched. From there, the storytelling falls apart even worse. The performances are fine, so I feel one will not be disappointed if they are big fans of Pace or Gellar, but the whole production looks confused and unprofessional (if you are going to pretend to film on the GG, check to see how many lanes it is - it is 6 not 3; if you are going to try and show time passage by dates on cell phones - check the actual date as they goofed that; the significant writing gaps once the last 1/2 of the film gets re-shot; Vancouver does not look like San Francisco, etc.)<br /><br />The BD quality is quite clear, except for the stock aerial footage of SF (looked 30 years old), the alternate camera in several sequences (a grid looking grain) and one or two interior shots. The DTS was overmixed in all of the sequences that tried to provoke a reaction, but it still sounded clear and the channels get a fair usage. The supplements showcase the confusion that ensued in filmmaking and the editing attempt:<br /><br />* Featurette, 3:30 minutes. A long trailer of brief interviews and footage. Forgettable.<br />* Deleted and Alternate scenes, alternate ending, 35 minutes. The actual deleted scenes only total a few minutes, the remaining thirty minutes would actually be the last 1/3 of the film. Once they made the ridiculous choice of filming the ending they put in the movie, all of the footage pertaining to the ENTIRELY different outcome for every character originally, had to be removed. Personally, for all of the problems they had with this production and distribution they should have left the other ending in place as an alternate/selectable version (like they did with the Law Abiding Citizen BD set). Cannot explain any of it as it would give away too much either way, but this ending was better written and more \\"shocking\\".<br /><br />English, Spanish subs, Region coded A only. Not to keep harping on this, but the cover art has nothing to do with the film - there are no ghosts, horror or other stuff like that. One star for the film, one for the BD specs and one for the supplements.ctually be the last 1/3 of the film.

B0035J6TAI|2.0|I'm a long time fan. I've seen Peter's performances in the U.S., as much as possible... whenever they are near the midwest. Mid 80's with the \\"Dancing Lights\\".... hell, I WANTED to be down near the stage during \\"Lay your Hands on Me\\", when Peter dropped backwards from the stage into the crowd.....all the way up to the Hampster ball (LOL), and the Dueling Segways!    I own every single release of his, plus remix releases and Soundtracks... The Last Temptation of Christ was brilliant... Long Walk home, Somber and insightful... Ovo, I understood... not my Fave. Up, was Brilliant... simply Brilliant. Saw him in Chicago... both on HIS OPENING DAY IN THE U.S. with the Blind Boys, and then again Outside in the blind rain storm (Luckily we were underneath the covered seating).    I am a true Fan... and I'm in my 40's.    This new album is not Peter's strength in my opinion. I Listened once, and most likely will never listen again. I Understand and appreciate remixes (or covers... with a twist). I understand and appreciate using an Orchestra in the manner he did. I did not appreciate most of the songs picked, nor thought they lent themselves to such a treatment, some of the bordering on the painful to listen to. It's not Mr. Gabriel's voice. He has a gift. It's not his creativity.... He is a talent. I can understand the compulsion to do this, assuming his age as an artist...     This type of cover or songs and \\"re-imagining\\" does not deserve an album. Songs such as this deserve a song (or perhaps 2) in full album of his material or inclusion in a soundtrack....If anyone in this day and age purchases this album without listening first to it, its a disservice.    There is no balance. In most of Peter Gabriel's albums they tell a story.... or cover a range of emotions.... There are up tempo rockers, some pop, or slow ballads (Sky Blue). All being tied together by his range in vocals and creativity (his strengths), and you can tell they are from His emotions and experiences...Were the songs picked for this release simply to bring in the other artists to do a Peter Gabriel song for an upcoming release (and I'll scratch yours...), regardless of their quality or lyrics? While I doubt it because of Peter's perfectionism, and his resolve.... I simply Ask.. Mr. Gabriel, please don't let age and Melancholy drive you. There are many fantastic places to go, and sing and write about, and a range of emotions to drive you.
B0025KVLRY|1.0|Like my dad I really love The Beatles but we were both very dissapointed when we sat down with a good glass of wine to listen to the CD we ordered. It didnt take long before we turned the CD off. Its was what we both called a \\"flat\\" sound. We couldnt believe we spent money on such poor quality sound! We compared the sound quality to the old tapes dad had and we quickly disposed the CDs. It wasnt only this particular CD. We ordered 3 CDs of The Beatles and they were all \\"bad\\". They were all lacking the sound depth. Just to compare we borrowed the same CDs from my dads friend, but recorded in 1994. Beautifull sound depth! Im sorry Amazon.com but the CDs does not deserve even one star for such poor sound quality.
B002VKE1K2|5.0|The movie is quite freaky. Its a story of a couple who believe there is a demon in their house. They plug cameras everywhere and try to catch on tape the strange things that happen in the house. They do, and they get totally freaked out.      I watched this movie knowing that its not real, it still was so scary. However I know people who watched it thinking its all true, and they couldn't sleep at night. The simplicity in the movie is what freaks you out the most. You can easily relate to the couple and to the fears they have. However there are 3 signs in the film that tell you its not real, they are as follows:     1) They stayed for at least 20 nights in the house facing the fears every night. If someone knows there is a demon in the house trying to haunt him/her, he/she would move out immediately. Even if you think it will follow you, you would go live with a group of people being realtives or friends. Worst case, you would go stay in a hotel where you know you will be surrounded with staff and security guards who will immediately interfere at the first sign of danger. You surely wouldn't stay in the same house knowing its haunted.     2) Why did they leave the door of the master bedroom open every night? This is where the demon enters the room from, and the door is what it uses to freak them out. Shut the door, put a closet behind it every day, and try to minimize the risk. Having the door open like that every night did not make sense.     3) Why did they wait until the 15th or 16th night to call the demonologist to come? If they were sure the house was haunted, they shouldn't have waited that long. They should have called him immedately.     Despite the above, the movie was so scary!

B00005OAA6|4.0|Victoria Beckham(nee Adams) Is best known as \\"Posh Spice\\" of the best selling girl group the Spice Girls. When the group split in 2001 each released solo efforts this is Mrs. VB's. I'll admit today in 2010 it does sound a little \\"2000/2001\\" and a little dated but still good. Too many want to hate on this just because of who it's by without giving it a fair shot. I'm a fan of hers(and SG) but I'm still able to be quite partial(IMO)So here it goes.  1.)Not Such An Innocent Girl-This was the lead single (appart from \\"Outta Your Mind\\"ft. Dane Bowers and the True Steppers witch is not on this album)It's a very good song but (IMO) not nearly the best song on here. It's a cute little \\"head bopper\\" if you will about Victoria being able to stand on her won and not being this glass doll some think she is. A valid point but there was a much better way make that point than this song.  2.)A Mind Of It's Own- (IMO) one of the better songs on here. Victoria slows it down a little for this mid-tempo song and the result is very nice. Victoria really shows she CAN sing on this one.  3.)That Kind Of Girl-This song is another (IMO) weak point on the album. It's basically NSAIG in reverse. It's not that bad though.  4.)Like That- This song is again just OK (IMO) Which is the big problem with this album as a whole to me. A little too may just ok songs that sound like filler and could have been better or scrapped all together for better songs.(IMO)  5.)Girlfriend-(IMO) one of the better songs on the record. It's fun and flirty without being silly.  6.)Midnight Fantasy-When I first listened to this album this was one of my favs. Now I've fallen out of love with it. To me there are much better songs on here. It's a cute song.  7.)I.O.U.- Another one of the better ones(IMO) on here. The backround really was choosen well and compliments Victoria's voice.  8.)No Trix,No Games-Yet another Ok song that isn't all that great but is ok. Frankly could have been scrapped.  9.)I Wish- This one is verygood(IMO) and another one of the better tracks. Another very good choice in backround music to compliment Victoria's very nice but sometimes thin voice.  10.)Whatcha Talking Bout'- Another very good one but frankly sounds alittle too similar at times to \\"I Wish\\". Despite that still one of the stand out tracks(IMO)  11.)Unconditional Love- Very nice mid-tempo ballad about her husband and son(Brooklyn, this was way before Romeo and Cruz were born)falls a little flat in some spots but the sentiment is the point and it's well done.   12.)Every Part Of Me-This (yet another) mid-tempo but much slower than the others song. Is about Brooklyn Beckham. Victoria lovingly and very nicely speak directly to her son and about how no matter what people say about her he will always be \\"every part of her\\". A beautiful song(IMO) one of VB's best in her solo music career. A very nice fitting way to close out the album as well. Overall like I said about Cheryl Cole(about to be Tweedy again's album) don't review this or buy it without REALLY listening to it and giving it a fair chance. I would also advise you not to read reviews by people who are haters and have nothing else better to do then review an album by someone they don't even like. VB isn't everyone's cup of tea and that's fine but for those who like this style of music(and/or VB and SG) then I think you'll enjoy this. It's not the best album in the world but it's certainly not the worst and is better(IMO) than a lot of people are willing to give it credit for.

0765350386|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. It's intelligent, the characters are 3 dimensional, and the story is interesting. It's even moving in some parts, which is hard for a book to achieve with me. A must read for anyone who likes good stories, let alone great fantasy books.

0765356147|3.0|I hated book 2 in this series, as it seemed to steal away all hope. This one is good enough as an ending book, but seriously falls short of the first book. I doubt I'll read it a second time because it wasn't that great, but it wasn't bad. Elend became something of a Mary Sue character, awesome at everything despite having failed spectacularly in book 2. There seemed to be no despair or doubt despite the everything going wrong most of the time. It borders on a mental disorder that there is practically no reaction to such a hopeless situation. The characters don't seem as likable as the first book, nor as interesting. It's almost like a common book. I will agree with others who say the overall story is fairly good and original, it has a hard time overcoming some obvious issues.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|This CD arrived in a timely matter and is a wonderful addition to my music collection. Very happy with the purchase!
0765356139|2.0|I felt the main theme throughout the first book was hope. Hope that the common man would rise up, hope that the impossible could be achieved, that there was some good and greatness left in a desolate and despairing world. This book steals all that hope away. Imagine the end of SW:The Empire Strikes Back with the rebel alliance almost completely destroyed, Chewbacca and Yoda dead, Leia crippled, a new fully operational death star with no weaknesses slaughtering people, along with all the other bad things that happened in that movie. That's pretty much how I felt at the end of this book. Every bad thing that could possible happen takes place, with no hope that things will ever get better. You'll leave this book feeling depressed, unhappy, and used.

B00006NSGX|3.0|Eric, I love ya.  Heck, I own every audio CD you've made.  Unfortunately, One More Car/Rider doesn't have what Eric does best, and that's play guitar.  Key To The Highway is pretty good.  There's a couple others that are pretty good.  None are great.  Where's the fire?  Where's the passion?  The last song is \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\" - on the same CD as \\"Cocaine\\", lol - and this kinda sums up this performance.  It's not the Eric we love.    The keyboard playing makes me want to gag.  Most of these songs don't have keyboards on the studio tracks.  The result is I feel like I'm listening to a lounge act trying to do Clapton, and it's bad.  I know Eric's still got the ability.  Listen to the Cream reunion CD which is done about 8 years later.  It smokes by comparison.    I'll keep this CD set in my collection, but sadly it probably won't get much play.  I hope for better things you Eric, before you hang up your Strat!

B002VKE1K2|1.0|....you obtain the Rifftrax.  Enough said.  Otherwise, this is the most poorly acted, poorly directed bit of pseudo-amateur horror genre ever created.  One look at the actor and actress, and you know that this whole thing is a big mistake.
0385522401|5.0|I spotted this Ian McEwan book at a thrift store. It looked like an easy read at only 203 pages and I knew that he was an acclaimed author so I thought I would give it a go.    I had not liked the movie Atonement, which was base upon his award-winning book, so I was a bit hesitant to read it.    However, once I started,  I could not put it down.     The lines were so clean, so clear, so concisely selected that I could see and feel the characters, the setting, their moods.    \\"They were young, educated, and both virgins on this, their wedding night, and they lived in a time when a conversation about sexual difficulties were plainly impossible.\\"    That is the first line of the novel. And it perfectly sums up the story.    But what McEwan does in the following two hundred and some odd pages is delve into their pasts to build  complete, full-figured characters that are drawn along the arc of the story into its inevitable climax.    I was pulled along by the story, curious not only about the characters themselves but anxious about the inevitable confrontation that was hinted at from the very beginning and how it would be resolved.    I couldn't help, after finishing the book, comparing it to Nicholas Sparks, who I detest for good reasons, namely, his lack of craftsmanship and cloying, maudlin manipulations of the reader's emotions.    McEwan's novel, though strictly speaking, is writing about love, and more significantly young, romantic love, is not attempting generate sentimental feelings for the reader. Instead, McEwan is recording the very personal story of two young people's wedding night. There is no sentimentality, but the lucid telling of a story.    It rang poignant and true, as clear as the sky on this Texas day.

0786888628|5.0|The Coldest Winter is labelled a history of the Korean War, but as with any work by David Halberstam it contains much more than the story of the conflict of 1950-53 itself.  This is primarily the story of the early Cold War years, when two superpowers, unsure of themselves and in constant fear of attack, uneasily jockeyed for position and influence in the world. I believe it will become one of the standard histories of that era.<br /><br />When North Korea invaded South Korea in the summer of 1950 an avalanche of consequences quickly ensued.  The United States and the United Nations quickly took action to block aggression by what they perceived to be a monolithic Marxist bloc.  The Communist world, in reality, was riven between factions and only theoretically controlled by the Soviet Union and its dictator Joseph Stalin.  The war began with a fast paced roar but then bogged down in an endless bloody stalemate.<br /><br />Halberstam did some of his finest writing since The Best and the Brightest in The Coldest Winter.  He was a master of the telling anecdote and the revealing character study.  Men like Douglas MacArthur and Harry Truman who have become icons of history have their weaknesses as well as their strengths clearly displayed.  But the finest parts of The Coldest Winter deal with the stories of the ordinary soldiers which are told here, often for the first time.

B000002HJR|5.0|This one gets a five star rating from me.  Not only does the album have an immaculate flow, but nearly every song on here is far above average.  The production on this album is almost perfect, there is a deep thick sound but it is not too polished.  I could rattle off song titles that are my favorites but that would be more than half the album.  Instead you need to just purchase this if you don't already have it.  And for you Pantera fans, I know you might not be ready to accept this but it's even better then your favorite Pantera album.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|A film that divides opinion is a film to see. Great performances, direction and cinematography, a fresh view of what it's like to live in a bubble within another culture, a satirical eye on career arcs and marriage in the 'creative' professions (acting, photography, nightclub singer), a truthful and tender portrayal of middle age, and of friendships that are deep, temporary, and platonic -- in other words, the world of filmmaking itself. Can't wait to see what Ms Coppola does next.
B001DJLD1M|4.0|Great buy if you just want the movies in their theatrical versions. Very few special features but overall great price.
B001TH16DI|3.0|I already have all of these on DVD.  But, for myself, I was really looking forward to seeing Star Trek-The Motion Picture: The Director's Cut (STTMP-DC) in Blu-Ray.  So, the set, from that standpoint, is a serious disappointment.  Although, there are a few scenes that in Blu-Ray appear clearer and cleaner than I remember in the theater, this version compared to the STTMP-DC version still disappoints.  Frankly, if I had known at the time that all of these were the theatrical versions, I probably would not have bought the set; regardless the price.  Yes, the picture quality is better overall.  But, frankly, my DVDs looked pretty great on my TV anyway.<br /><br />When the original STTMP was released in the theaters, I was 22 and must have seen it more than 20 times; even when it was re-released in a double bill with Close Encounters...(those were the days).  I've seen it so many times, I feel I should own stock in it.<br /><br />The purist are always going to prefer the theatrical version; even though the trip through V'ger's energy field did slow things down quite a bit.  But, that's OK.  Apparently though, I am not a purist.  I find the additional material inserted into this, and the other movies, were virtual revelations and only added to my understanding, enjoyment, and ultimately made the stories more coherent.  In this set, all of that is gone.<br /><br />The STTMP-DC is suppose to restore Robert Wise's (director of Sound of Music, Andromeda Strain, Day the Earth Stood Still, etc. ) true original vision; no longer being hampered by budgetary demands.  While there are some scenes I believe should have been preserved, it is still an infinitely superior version; far better pacing and additional effects that allows us to take in what previously could only be hinted at.<br /><br />Some have attacked STTMP and stated that this is the lesser of the six movies (did anybody see #5?).  Less or not, this is as close as one get's to Roddenberry's true vision.  I've actuallyheard the man in person at those speech/lectures that he would sometimes give around the country.  Star Trek may have started out as \\"Gunsmoke\\" among the stars, but it apparently became much more for him later on.  For him, Star Trek was about the \\"human adventure\\"; man's exploration of himself and the universe around him.  The other 5 movies were much more \\"studio\\" formula projects.  Good stories, but I imagine if Roddenberry was calling all of the shots (ie George Lucas), we would have never seen Star Treks #3 and #5.  Think about it, part of the human condition is death, so Spock would have never been resurrected in #3 and according to Star Trek's \\"bible\\", Spock was an only child, so there goes the story-line for #5.  Like it or not, if people want to know what Star Trek is suppose to be (being true to Roddenberry's vision), STTMP is it; not the other nine movies or the wreck that Abrams created (actually, I have been thinking of a storyline that would restore the original Star Trek's timeline and...bring back peace to our galaxy  ;-)  ).<br /><br />If you have to have Blu-ray, go ahead.  My suggestion, if you already have them, particularly in their Director's Cuts, don't waste your money.  For those of you wanting the set for the \\"round table\\" disc, wait.  Netflix will eventually have it so you can rent, or, maybe Amazon will have it in their \\"streaming\\" catalog.

1400049628|4.0|A wonderful and very fun read.<br /><br />The Zombie Survival Guide takes you into the world of the undead. Written in the style of a regular survival manual, The Zombie Survival Guide is far from regular. Brooks starts off by talking about the origins of the zombie menace. It explains what causes the dead to rise, the name of the virus and much more useful information. Brooks really tries to make you believe that this is the real cause of the zombies and this is how they function. It is all written in humor, that's why you will find this book in the humor section but zombies are far from funny.<br /><br />This is a hard book to review since there really is no plot and no characters. It is a lot of fun though. You'll learn survival tips for surviving a zombie outbreak. The book discusses the correct weapons to defend yourself and the ones to distance yourself from. Many more interesting bits of information like how to identify the warning signs of an early zombie outbreak and what to do once you find yourself facing the undead.<br /><br />The Zombie Survival Guide is also available as an unabridged audio book. It is put out my Random House Audio, and read by Marc Cashman, who does a great job. He reads the book with as much of a straight face as it was written. The audio book runs at 8 hours and 38 minutes, it is rather long but it will keep you entertained. I'll add a link to the end of this review.<br /><br />Overall The Zombie Survival Guide is a great read, very smart, very funny and well thought out. Max Brooks is a genius when if comes to zombies in literature. I give The Zombie Survival Guide 4 Undead Heads out of 5.

6305903182|4.0|In the follow up to 1997's &quot;Scream 2&quot;, Scream 3 takes fans on one final journey into Ghost Face's unimaginable horror and killer like rampage. The third Scream has an ensemble cast with new faces Patrick Dempsey, Park Posey and reunites us with Scream survivors (Neve Campbell- Sidney), David Arquette (Dewey), and Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox Arquette). Scream 3 improves much upon the second film which many raved was better than the first, and I did not think so. I thought Scream 3 was an exceptional finale and best sequel of the Scream films. The third film investigates further into the bizarre and weird life of Maureen Prescott (Sidney's mother) and what she did before she joined Woodsboro and married Sidney's father. Sidney has left into hiding since college graduation and Scream 2 and has secluded herself deep inside northern California. Dewey has gone to films helping the Scream like Stab offshoots and Gale Weathers has gone to national media highly publicizing her Stab books and Scream experiences. The third film reunites them as someone in the Stab film set has gone crazy killing many of the cast and helps bring Sidney out of hiding, while letting Ghost Face plan his final move. Overall Scream 3 was much more comical than the first two with much applied humor. There was also a big set of surprises (including Cotton Weary and the killer at the end) as Scream 3 goes where no Scream has gone before, breaking all the set genre horror rules that the first two made up.
B001OQCV2E|2.0|The special effects were fantastic, but the rest of the movie was terrible.  The human interactions were maudlin.  The story line was ridiculous.  We were led to believe that the planet was going to be totally destroyed, only to find out that it was possible to survive this cataclysm in a buch of boats.  If this disaster was foreseen, why weren't there more boats?  As is usual with disaster movies, we are presented with the private lives of the main characters, their ambitions and their struggles.  But it was all so sickening.  Even though the special effects were tremendous, they hardly make up for the terrible story line and dialogue.

B0015DROBO|3.0|This book is engaging enough that most readers will probably enjoy it, but it left a lot wanting for me.  I'll try to do a spoiler free critic.<br /><br />There are two main characters in this story: Mikael Blomkvist, the honorable middle-aged journalist who is forced to take a job playing super-sleuth, and Lisbeth Salander, a social outcast and brilliant young hacker.  Almost inevitably these two meet up and work together to solve a decades old mystery concerning the disappearance of a young woman and to bring down a powerful, corrupt businessman.  The mystery they must solve was the highlight of the book for me.  It was at times intensely interesting, but at other times extremely frustrating and ultimately anti-climactic.  I stopped reading the book for a few weeks after the mystery was solved, partially because I was let down by the resolution and partially because I was not terribly interested in the secondary storyline of the corrupt businessman.  I had to push my way through to the end.  While the ending is an obvious segway to the next book, it left me with no desire to continue reading the series.<br /><br />My biggest criticism of the book is how arranged everything feels.  The characters came off as rather two-dimensional and more like puppets being set up and moved around for the sake of the story.  A lot of horrible things happen to a number of the characters in this book, but I felt the author did not fully explore the effects these events had on the characters.  Another problem I had was that there are too many convenient characters and situations to allow for anything interesting to happen.<br /><br />In the end I'd say that I left this book feeling shocked by the events in the book, as well as shocked by the character's actions and reactions relating to these events.  I wouldn't particularly recommend this book to anyone, but I think readers who enjoy a good mystery and thrills without any emotional depth will probably really like this book.<br /><br />For Kindle readers: There were a few mistakes, but overall the formatting is good.  No problems reading this on Kindle.ere a few mistakes, but overall the formatting is good.  No problems reading this on Kindle.

It was like watching the movie all over again! The pictures are magical. It even has stories about how the creators got their ideas for the characters and the animals. It's an art book and it has information about making the movie. I highly recommend owning this beautiful book. Jane
B001OQCV2E|1.0|I knew I was in trouble almost from the start of this 2 hr and 28 min film. I began to ask questions and my disbelief radar went up. I didn't expect much from Roland Emmerich. He has made a couple of the worst movies ever. I knew that this film wasn't going to be high art. I had read the critics and knew about the bad acting, terrible script, and the cheesiness of it all, but I still thought I'd see a good no-brainer where things get blown up real good. What I did not expect was the lack of rationality, script cohesion, awful science, and bad CGI. I was too aware of the awfulness of it all to enjoy this disaster of a disaster movie. The only consolation of sitting through 2 1/2 hours of bad film were my frequent giggles at terribly delivered lines by the actors (perhaps the worst acting by the otherwise fine John Cusak ever), bad science, and idiotic use of CGI. After the first hour of watching, I wondered if this film was actually meant to be a parody of such films. I certainly laughed a lot.    My initial suspension of disbelief began at the start of the film. John Cusak is late to pick up his kids from his divorced wife's house to go on a camping trip. His car does not start. In the next scene we see him getting into a limo and using it for transportation. No explanation is given of why he has access to a limo until halfway through the film. He picks up his kids and off they go on the camping trip. Arriving at Yellowstone, I felt that the producers must have made a mistake. He left from southern California in a limo on a camping trip with 2 young children. Perhaps they confused Yellowstone with Yosemite. No, it was no mistake. I, the viewer, am expected to believe that he drove all the way to Yellowstone in a matter of hours in a limo.  And not only once. He drives back to California and returns to Yellowstone. That must be some limo.    Once my suspension of disbelief was destroyed, I noticed everything else that was bad about the film, so many of them that I began to laugh out loud: The supermarket that splits into two jagged parts, a light plane flying amidst a city being torn apart (this impossible feat of flying is repeated later in the film) , a main character using a cell phone after being told that all global communication was not working (repeated on the ark), a crack appearing between the hand of God and David in the Sistine Chapel, the dog running for the ark (yeah! save that dog!). All so remarkably bad.    If you like to hoot at bad film, this is one for you. It will have you rolling n the aisles.

B000Z27HLS|2.0|We were surprised by this movie.  My family saw the name \\"Jane Austen\\" and thought they knew what they were getting in to but we were highly disappointed after wasting most of the 86 minutes it took to watch it (by the way, be aware that you are getting a short version movie).  The acting was great and the filming was fine (hence two stars).  In addition to that, I can't argue that what was portrayed of someone else's life was not \\"realistic\\".  That said though, I don't like having my family wade through other people's moral trash, shallow fantasizing and \\"wild oat sowing\\" to get to the 10% of what could be considered as the good \\"life values\\" in this movie.  I'm all for strong family values and reinforcement of good character by modeling great character, but there was way too little of either of those in this movie.  I'm not against juxtaposition in that process (it usually takes a bad setting to show good character) but I feel this movie is seriously imbalanced in the negative direction in that arena.  Since I could not elevate the character values portrayed in most of this movie for myself, or for my family members, I would highly recommend not even watching it.
B001HN6940|4.0|For starters, it seems that everyone I know is shocked when I tell them that this Alice in Wonderland is a sequel of sorts. At the age of 19 and about to be forced into marriage, this is Alice's second trip to Wonderland. I'm glad Tim Burton and his team came up with a new story that still featured all the great characters from the original source material. That's also where the weakest part of the movie lies. The dialogue given to the characters is great, but the script is razor thin. I think if more effort went into this particular aspect, I would have given it five stars.<br /><br />I saw it in IMAX 3-D and the visuals are as grand and beautiful as you would expect from Burton. It's not quite as eye-popping as Avatar, which was shot completely in IMAX 3-D, whereas, Alice in Wonderland was upconverted (Clash of the Titans is doing the same thing). The music by Danny Elfman is some of his best stuff in recent years and the costumes/makeup are top notch.<br /><br />Aside from the look of film, the acting also makes it very memorable. There are so many well animated and voice acted characters running around I don't know where to begin. I guess I'll start with those made of flesh and blood. I didn't like Depp's take on Willy Wonka that much, and I'm a big fan of his, but his Mad Hatter is just the right amount of crazy. His voice goes back and forth from having a lisp to sounding like William Wallace from Braveheart. His look is so jarring, you probably wouldn't even know it was him if you somehow dodged all the advertisements before entering the theater. Helena Bonham Carter played the Red Queen brilliantly. I couldn't take my eyes off her giant head. Anne Hathaway really surprised me here (in a good way) with her take on the White Queen and it was nice to see Crispin Glover back on the big screen in a role that suited him. Last, but certainly not least, Mia Wasikowska was absolutely captivating as Alice. The way she talked and her reactions were just what the film needed in it's central role. All the digital animal characters were great, but my favorites were the Cheshire Cat, voice by Stephen Fry, and the March Hare voiced by Paul Whitehouse.<br /><br />I'm somewhat surprised that the combination of violence and meanness, along with the smoking Blue Caterpillar didn't get this a PG-13 rating. It's not too harsh, but young kids might get a little freaked out.<br /><br />Overall, Alice in Wonderland looks like a polished jewel, has great acting/voice acting, wonderful music and even manages to get quite a few laughs in the process. If only the simple story didn't let me down in the end, this could have been a classic in the making. Even still, I wouldn't mind Tim Burton taking us on another trip down the rabbit hole in a few years.ntral role.

B0030Y11XS|1.0|A friend invited me to a private screening of this film. The invite, not surprisingly, leaned in a certain direction:<br /><br />\\"Moore takes us into the homes of ordinary people whose lives have been turned upside down; and he goes looking for explanations in Washington, DC and elsewhere. What he finds are the all-too-familiar symptoms of a love affair gone astray: lies, abuse, betrayal and 14,000 jobs being lost every day. Capitalism: A Love Story is Michael Moore's ultimate quest to answer the question he's posed throughout his illustrious filmmaking career: Who are we and why do we behave the way that we do?\\"<br /><br />Considering Moore was going to be there for a Q&A after (moderated by Arianna Huffington), I quickly signed on. Now before painting a picture of Moore's new film, let me be honest: my belief set is essentially libertarian (\\"Government out of my bedroom and my pocketbook\\"). Not only do government solutions not excite me, they scare the living blank out of me. Remember when George Bush declared, \\"I've abandoned free-market principles to save the free-market system to make sure the economy doesn't collapse\\"? He might as well of said, \\"Hide your money, kids -- 'cause I'm coming to take it!\\"<br /><br />Oh sure, in theory I would like to see everyone with their own homestead, money in their pocket for regular shopping frenzies, and no health worries despite eating at Burger King 24/7, but arriving at those goals is not exactly doable unless government robs Peter to pay Paul and/or starts up the printing press.<br /><br />And that view of course puts me in opposition to Moore since he has no problem with government as his and our father figure. That is his utopia. He truly believes that warehouses of federal workers, in Washington, D.C., remotely running our lives is the optimal plan. He is an unapologetic socialist who really doesn't care why the poor are poor or the rich are rich, he just wants it fixed. So not surprisingly -- and with some generalization as I proffer this -- Democrats like Moore and Republicans don't.<br /><br />However, I was excited to see a \\"mainstream\\" film that was backed by big Hollywood bucks conclude capitalism is \\"evil.\\" Arguably the most successful documentarian ever -- a man who has made untold millions of dollars -- was going to legitimately make the case that there was an alternative to capitalism. I sat down in a packed Mann's Bruin Theatre in Westwood, California, eager to see how his vision could possibly flesh out.<br /><br />Moore is a rather simple guy. He is likable. He sees the world as good guys (people with no money) and bad guys (people with money). His Flint, Michigan, union-worker upbringing is his worldview. If you did not have that upbringing or if your life started less severe than his, you are an evil capitalist. If, on the other hand, you are a laid-off factory worker with a sixth-grade education, you are a true hero.<br /><br />I don't care one way or the other that he has that view and I am not knocking union workers, but Moore sees the world through a class-warfare lens resulting in a certain agenda: force wealth to be spread amongst everyone regardless of effort.<br /><br />Within minutes it was clear where Capitalism: A Love Story was headed.<br /><br />We listen to heartbreaking stories of foreclosed families across America -- but we don't learn why the foreclosures happened. Did these people treat their homes as piggy banks? Was there refinancing on top of refinancing just to keep buying mall trinkets and other goodies with no respect to risk or logic? We don't find out.<br /><br />We meet one family that is so desperate for money that they were willing to accept $1,000 for cleaning out the house that they were just evicted from. Was it sad? Yes. But should we end capitalism due to this one family in Peoria, IL?<br /><br />We are introduced to a guy whose company, called Condo Vultures, is buying and selling foreclosed properties. Since he acted like a usedcar salesman, the implication was that he was an evil capitalist. However, Moore doesn't tell us if his buyers were \\"working-class\\" people making smart buying decisions after prices had dropped.<br /><br />We listen to Catholic priests who denounce capitalism as an evil to be eradicated. What would they put in its place and how would the new system work? The priests don't tell us.<br /><br />We learn that Wal-Mart bought life insurance policies on many workers. We are then told to feel outrage when Wal-Mart receives a large payout from an employee death while the family still struggles with bills. I saw where Moore was heading here, but is this a reason to end capitalism?<br /><br />We hear a story from a commercial pilot so low on money that he has to use food stamps. Moore points out that many pilots are making less than Taco Bell managers and then attributes a recent plane crash in Buffalo to underpaid pilots. This one crash is extrapolated as yet another reason to end capitalism.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised at Moore's attempt at balance. For example, he included a carpenter who, while boarding up a foreclosed home, says, \\"If people pay their bills, they don't get thrown out.\\"<br /><br />There is also a dressing-down of Senator Chris Dodd (D) by name. Moore called out a top Democrat? He sure did. He nailed him.<br /><br />There is a lengthy dissertation on the evils of Goldman Sachs. He rips Robert Rubin and Hank Paulson big time, and I agree with him. In fact, I said to myself, \\"Moore, you should have done your whole film on Goldman Sachs!\\"<br /><br />Throughout the various stories and interviews he also weaves a conspiracy theory (all Moore films do this). The plot goes something like this: America won World War II and quickly dominated because there was no competition (Germany and Japan were destroyed). We had great postwar success where everyone lived in union-like equality. Jobs were plentiful and families were happy. However, things started to go bad in the 1970s -- here Moore uses a snippet of President Carter preaching about greed. This clip was predictably building to Moore's big reason for all of today's problems: the Reagan Revolution.<br /><br />Moore sees Reagan entering the scene as a shill for corporate-banking interests. However, everyone is happy as the good times roll all the way through into Clinton era. Moore does take subtle shots at President Clinton, but nails his right-hand economic man, Larry Summers, directly as a primary reason for the banking collapse. While Moore sees Japan and Germany today as socialistic winners where corporations benefit workers more than shareholders, he sees America sinking fast.<br /><br />So is that it? That was the proof that capitalism is an evil to eliminate? Essentially, yes, that's Moore's proof.<br /><br />What is his solution? Tugging on your idealistic heartstrings of course! Moore ends his film with recently uncovered video of FDR talking to America on January 11, 1944. Looking into the camera, a weary FDR proposed what he called a second Bill of Rights -- an economic Bill of Rights for all -- regardless of station, race, or creed -- that included:<br /><br />* the right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries or shops or farms or mines of the nation;<br />* the right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation;<br />* the right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return which will give him and his family a decent living;<br />* the right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home or abroad;<br />* the right of every family to a decent home;<br />* the right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health;<br />* the right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment;<br />* and the right to a good education.<br /><br />As FDR concluded and the film ended, I was shocked at the reaction. The theater of 400-plus spectators stood and cheered wildly at FDR's 1944 proposal. The questions running through my head were immediate: how does one legislate words like useful, enough, recreation, adequate, decent, and good? Who decides all of this and to what degree?<br /><br />Interestingly, during the Q&A, Huffington and Moore discussed bank-failure fears during the fall of 2008. They asked for a show of hands of how many people moved money around or attempted to protect against a bank failure. I had the only hand that went up.<br /><br />FDR's plan, hauled out by Moore six decades after it was forgotten, reminded me of another interchange -- this one from the 1970s. Then talk-show master -- the Oprah of his day -- Phil Donahue was interviewing free-market economist Milton Friedman and wanted to know if Friedman had ever had a moment of doubt about \\"capitalism and whether greed's a good idea to run on?\\"<br /><br />Friedman was quick in response:<br /><br />\\"Is there some society you know that doesn't run on greed? You think Russia doesn't run on greed? You think China doesn't run on greed? ... The world runs on individuals pursuing their separate interests. The great achievements of civilization have not come from government bureaus. Einstein didn't construct his theory under order from a bureaucrat. Henry Ford didn't revolutionize the automobile industry that way. In the only cases in which the masses have escaped from the kind of grinding poverty you're talking about, the only cases in recorded history are where they have had capitalism and largely free trade. If you want to know where the masses are worst off, it's exactly in the kinds of societies that depart from that. So that the record of history is absolutely crystal clear: that there is no alternative way so far discovered of improving the lot of the ordinary people that can hold a candle to the productive activities that are unleashed by a free enterprise system.\\"<br /><br />Donahue (and the video of this on YouTube is classic) then countered saying that capitalism doesn't reward virtue, but instead rewards the ability to manipulate the system. Friedman was having none of it:<br /><br />\\"And what does reward virtue? You think the communist commissar rewards virtue? ... Do you think American presidents reward virtue? Do they choose their appointees on the basis of the virtue of the people appointed or on the basis of their political clout? Is it really true that political self-interest is nobler somehow than economic self-interest? ... Just tell me where in the world you find these angels who are going to organize society for us?\\"<br /><br />Friedman's logic was what I was remembering as a theater full of people cheered wildly for a second Bill of Rights. How did this film crowd actually think FDR's 1944 vision could be executed? Frankly, it was clear to me at that moment that capitalism is on shaky ground. From Bush \\"abandoning\\" capitalism to bailouts for everyone, to Obama gifting away the future, we seriously might be past the point of no return toward a socialization of America.<br /><br />Figuring someone else must see the problems with this film, I started poking around the net for other views. One critic declared that the value of Capitalism: A Love Story was not in the moviemaking, but in its message that hits you in the gut and makes you angry. This film did not make me angry, but it did punch me in the gut. The people in that theater with me, including Moore, were not bad people. They just seem to all have consumed a lethal dose of Kool-Aid.<br /><br />At the end of his Q&A, Moore pushed the audience to understand that while they don't have the money, they do have the vote. He implored them to use their vote to take money from one group to give it to another group. Did he really say that openly with no ambiguity? Yes, sadly.bad in the 1970s -- here Moore uses a snippet of President Carter preaching about greed.

1846553482|5.0|Extra Information: The first two books for this Harry Hole series The Bat Man and The Cockroaches have not been produced for translation at this time. [[ASIN:0061134007 The Redbreast: A Novel]] would be the third book in this series; if you were to start this series my recommendation would be from The Redbreast. The series then follows through in order with [[ASIN:0061655511 Nemesis: A Novel (Harry Hole)]], [[ASIN:0061133973 The Devil's Star: A Novel]], [[ASIN:0307355721 The Redeemer]] followed by The Snowman which then brings us readers in wait for The Leopard.<br /><br />Review - The Snowman (Harry Hole, Book Seven)<br /><br />Little snowflakes start to fall taunting us with what's to come. Flurries grow stronger settling softly on the ground, powdery and fluffy at first but darkness soon takes hold, the cycle turns. Subfreezing temperatures, crystals formulate and yet dipped in magical moonlight everything sparkles and glisten. This brings a gentle calm of all things white and beautiful..............until someone builds a Snowman!<br /><br />November Oslo, Jo Nesbø brings us into his story during family hour. The first snow has fallen and a discussion is taking place about a solitary figure looming in the garden. A snowman with big black stone eyes staring into the house and yet no one seems to know who built it. That same evening a young boy wakes to find his mother missing, he looks for her but all he finds is her pink scarf which the snowman is now wearing.<br /><br />Harry Hole is brought in to investigate, what is thought to be a missing person to others, Harry has doubts, convinced there is a connection after receiving an anonymous letter some months earlier signed \\"The Snowman\\". His team look into old case files they find an alarming number of wives and mothers disappearances. A second mother then goes missing this time the snowman leaves his signature and handiwork, Harry's horror is confirmed but to catch a killer his to become a pawn in a deadly game for the serial killer will only play against the best.<br /><br />Love this Authors work, for me in all his books its what this author is not afraid to write about, social issues of life and the way he brings in nature, wildlife to identify, relate too, which keeps these books intelligent and interesting. The cycle of life with all its shaded areas, loyalties or disloyalties, weaknesses, infidelities, parenthood, control, goodness fighting fear/evil from within. I'm not so sure in looking back to the first two books after working my way forwards from the third book and all in translation in this wonderful series this Author proves to stay one step ahead he goes from strength to strength.<br /><br />Jo Nesbø novels are very descriptive he pays attention to detail with brain teasing puzzles even for us long term readers still he pulls snow hats over our eyes. This novel is darker than the others, close contender the devil's star but darker for me is marvelous and skin crawling with suspense. The Snowman also has references to the first book written The Bat Man which is not in English translation, a story line based in Australia, any references made to that first book are explained throughout.<br /><br />The Authors observation of people is once again uncanny all are well drawn. Harry Hole is a compelling character to read, still fighting the bottle urges and his love life is complicated. A new character emerges Katrine Bratt who joins Harrys team, you warm to her quickly as she takes the no nonsense approach with life and Harry which is really what he needs.<br /><br />For any first time readers starting any Jo Nesbø books, go in with suspicion, gather your list of characters remember trust no one and suspect the rest. The author has a remarkable way of twisting and turning plots, throwing in enough red herrings, smoked and salted with changing subjects and diverted argument. Yet he keeps the story line and smaller stories, exciting, entertaining with added dry humor, tying up loose threads and even though he gives enough information pulls off a fast paced unexpected ending. You have to feel convinced and this author for me delivers each and every time.<br /><br />The Leopard is next in translation and has already won the Danish award Palle Rosenkrantz Prize, congratulation to the Author. Even though its not listed on amazon yet, its already on my wish list in the hope I can have this in the not to distance future.<br /><br />Fantastic, loved it , The Snowman comes Highly Recommended. Also adding here a thank you to Don Bartlett for the clear translation in the series.<br /><br />Andrea Bowhillinformation pulls off a fast paced unexpected ending.

1401224253|4.0|One reviewer argues that the premise--the boy from Krypton landing in the USSR as opposed the U.S.--had the potential to be a brilliant meditation on the genealogy of morals and right and wrong. He deems it a dud, and I must strongly disagree. While the writing may not push the premise to its fullest potential, is is nonetheless a really thougtful \\"what if\\" narrative, that does a good job of thinking about how nationalism is mapped onto the superhero body. I suspect it is accessible for people who do not know Superman chapter and verse, as well as throwing bones to the faithful.  I give it 4 instead of 5 stars because I think there are a few intellectual strands that could have been pushed more, the final battle was resolved too easily, and the women are pathetic here. I a big fan of Millar, but he's not great with women, and in this story Lois Lane and particularly Wonder Woman are sad women desiring scraps from their men. However, the ending is a knock out.

0375413405|5.0|This is the best cookbook I've seen so far. It has no pictures or fancy graphics, but it is absolutely wonderful. It teaches valuable techniques that no other cookbooks do. It is important to read all the instructions and methods for food preparation before even choosing a recepie. I had no idea about so many things important in cooking. The book is completely addictive and the more I cook from it the more I want to learn. This book TEACHES ME HOW TO COOK!!  Highly recommended. Cook several recepies from it and you won't be able to stop.

B0035J6TA8|3.0|Peter Gabriel is an incredibly creative, intelligent and unusual musical artist.  His work as a founding member and original front man for Genesis (their first seven albums and incredible stage shows), his solo work (including his four eponymous albums and the hit laden So), his movie soundtracks (including Passion, the soundtrack from The Last Temptation of Christ) his collaborations with Robert Fripp (of King Crimson), his promotion of world music and his longtime support for Amnesty International all firmly establish him as one of the most important artists of our time. Gabriel's talents as a songwriter/lyricist, singer and bandleader are probably underappreciated.  His concerts with Genesis in the 1970s and as a solo artist in the 1980s were unique aural and visual experiences; Gabriel was an incredible performer who knew how to both entertain and connect with his audience.     So what about this latest offering?  Well, the premise is good, a slight twist on the somewhat tired covers-album formula. As he explains in the excellent liner notes, the idea was for Peter and his colleagues to select a handful of songs to cover on one disc, and in turn, have each of the original artists of those songs cover one of Peter's songs on a companion disc.  Hence, as Peter explains, the title of the album (the accompanying disc, now to be released at a later date, was to be referred to \\"and I'll scratch yours\\").  The ground rules: no drums or guitar.  So what we have here are some terrific songs sung by Gabriel (in his unique talking/singing style) and accompanied by his piano/keyboard playing, [Brian Eno/Robert Fripp like] electronics and orchestral (and on one track, choral) backing.     The pacing of the songs, at least of the few I'm familiar with, is much slower than the originals.  What we have are mostly very slow, emotionally driven, ballads.  Think the comparison between Gabriel's own \\"Here Comes The Flood\\" on his first eponymous solo album and the version included onhis first hits collection, Shaking The Tree (both of which paled in comparison to Gabriel's emotional reading of the same song with Robert Fripp's effect laden guitar on Fripp's Exposure).  Some -- but not all -- of the covers offered here are interesting, and several are actually moving, given Gabriel's emotional readings and some beautifully arranged electronic and orchestral accompaniment.  To me, his cover of \\"My Body Is A Cage,\\" from Arcade Fire's Neon Bible album, is one of the better offerings, and \\"Philadelphia\\" a Neil Young song with which I am not familiar, is beautifully rendered.  Other songs with which I am familiar (\\"Heroes\\" [David Bowie] and \\"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\\" [Radiohead]), however, are weak covers that pale when compared to the original terrific versions.     In sum, while this album does offer some nice readings, as a whole it's a snooze-fest.  Pleasant to be sure, but hardly essential.  This is not in the same league as almost any one of Gabriel's aforementioned works. If you're really into Gabriel, by all means pick this up; just don't expect to be playing it all that often, except as background music.  If you're not familiar with Gabriel's work, start elsewhere.  I'm giving this effort an extra star because of the fine artwork and liner notes included in the packaging, and because it's hard to give any effort by Peter Gabriel less than three stars.     ADDENDUM:  I have been listening to, and enjoying, this CD in my car for the last few days.  While what I stated above is accurate, I may have been somewhat harsh in my overall assessment.  I must make special mention of the cover of \\"Listening Wind\\" [Talking Heads], which is beautifully rendered here, and which, upon repeated listens, is probably the highlight of this album.  For Gabriel fans, this is a very different release, with an emphasis on Peter's unique vocals and the lyrics to some very fine songs.  At its best, it is a very mature, moving album, although the overall mood is quite somber.  Many Gabriel fans, however, as the reviews posted here demonstate, will find this release disappointing.  As stated above, it is not comparable to any of Gabriel's previous efforts.  This is not the second coming of So.  I would give this effort three and one-half stars if I could, subject to the foregoing caveats.
B001KEHAI0|5.0|\\"Where's everybody going?\\"<br />\\"To Gobbler's Knob - it's Groundhog Day!\\"<br />\\"It's still just once a year isn't it?\\"<br /><br />What would you do if you found you had to live the same day over and over again? That's the question facing Phil Connors (Bill Murray, Ghostbusters) who surely gives one of the performances of his career as the cynical, grouchy weatherman of a TV network in this superb comedy.<br />Phil is sent to the small town of Punxsutawney in Pennsylvania to cover the Groundhog Day festivities, but ends up being trapped in the town when a freak blizzard strikes and he is unable to go home. Things get even weirder when he wakes up the next day, and finds it is Groundhog Day, again.<br />And again... and again....<br />It is a great credit to director Harold Ramis and the screenwriters that this film is consistently hilarious and fresh, despite having essentially just 1 joke in it. It really had me laughing out loud in places because of the supremely witty script and some of the escapades in the film, and there's something so funny about the way Phil is first puzzled it is the same day again, then bewildered or angry, then discovers he can change his persona each time he lives through Groundhog Day to suit his needs - even if manipulating his day to win the heart of cheerful producer Rita (Andie McDowell) is not quite so easy...<br />Andie's performance in the film is very good and her romance with Bill Murray's character is sweetly believable, the pair have nice chemistry between them.<br /><br />Poor Phil has to resort to desperate measures to make it become the next day which can be very funny indeed, and even though his character is cynical and has an arrogant, even cruel, streak in the beginning you feel sorry for him as the film goes on which, again, I feel is a sign of excellent writing. We are at one with Phil, seeing the film through his eyes - we want him to succeed and end up with Rita.<br /><br />I loved the \\"repeated\\" scenes in the film, showing how his reaction changes (perhaps ironically because they are something you know is going to happen), like the smashing of the clock radio playing I Got You, Babe. That scene never fails to make me laugh.<br />I think the film even poses interesting questions beneath the gags - how would you live your life if you had free reign to what you wanted, with no consequences? Would you be happy?<br />Through his experiences, Phil gradually changes his outlook, becoming a more compassionate, nicer person and tries his best to help the people around him instead of just thinking of himself. A simple moral message perhaps, but told so well, and paced perfectly that allows for touching scenes and nice character development. The film isn't preachy, but the fact it has this lesson, which you kind of follow along with Phil, makes for a deeper experience.<br />I think the message of the film (in order to find happiness, Bill Murray has to change, be a nicer person and like himself) spiritual and meaningful - this surprised me because I'm not religious.<br /><br />It's certainly one of my favourite films, one of the best comedies ever - and a modern American classic that I love.nically because they are something you know is going to happen), like the smashing of the clock radio playing I Got You, Babe.

The film isn't preachy, but the fact it has this lesson, which you kind of follow along with Phil, makes for a deeper experience.  I think the message of the film (in order to find happiness, Bill Murray has to change, be a nicer person and like himself) spiritual and meaningful - this surprised me because I'm not religious.    It's certainly one of my favourite films, one of the best comedies ever - and a modern American classic that I love.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|I admit I'm a disaster movie addict:  TOWERING INFERNO, POSEIDON ADVENTURE, ETC.  And 2012 is the new standard for the genre.  Yes the plot and characters represent all the cliches found in these kind of movies, but didn't we see this for all the mass destruction?<br />And wow---the effects are awesome!  I don't know why Oscar only allowed 3 nominees for visual effects this year giving the nods to more critically acclaimed films.  The effects in 2012 are definitely Oscar worthy and it's a shame Oscar overlooked this film's astounding visual effects.<br />I think John Cusack and cast did just fine;  the musical score was commendable.  If you look great disaster movies, you can't beat this one!

B000004756|5.0|Whenever these three players come together there will be two things - one amazement at the music and the second is the inevitable comparison to Friday Night In San Francisco, a truly remarkable CD that is very special in its own right.    Unlike FNISF, this is a studio recording so some of the energy is different - the audience interaction during the live CD really added to the record.  That does not mean this record is lacking in energey, it is just different.    It is more subdued and thoughtful.  Though the technique of the players still shine through, which is to be expected and still as jawdropping as ever, overall it does not seem as fast as the other recordings and there is more breathing room with great passages.  Azzura is a good example of this, hypnotic and spiced with the guitar virtuso sections.    Overall a very well balanced record covering many moods and feelings.  Flamenco, Jazz, interesting scales and tones, it is all here as to be expected.   Each track stands on its own and together they are a great musical experience.

B001NLL8LA|3.0|I'm 90% done but just have to take the time to write the review now.  Very satisfied to this point -- but putting the book down out for an hour or two out of frustration.    Don't reach further if you don't want to know about the ending...    Throughout the book Reacher has shown a vast knowledge of many subjects, spewing facts and specifications like he just read the manuals on everything he sees.  As usual, he as shown great ingenuity and cleverness - more so than his opponents. Of course, until the end...     After starting out with 30 rounds to kill 12 enemies, he ends up having only 1 round for the final 2.  He has previously picked up a gun with 9 rounds and instead of putting the gun in his pocket, he empties it and puts them in his pocket (supposedly AFTER noticing that they are the same caliber for his machine gun).      Question/comments for the author: a smart man either loads them into the machine then, or keeps them in the hand-gun - having 9 rounds in your pocket in the middle of a gun-fight only server one purpose - to make the end of the book more exciting (but belieive able) than it should be.       We can forgive the liberties you take as Reacher can always figure out which hotel or restaurant (out of a possible 100+ available ) his target has chosen.  That's part of the Reacher appeal. Same with the size, strength, ability to wake-up at any time, etc.    Making Reacher a friggin-idiot is not what your fans want to see

B002MCJZHS|5.0|I fell for this album at first listen.<br /><br />I didn't even have to listen all the way through; I was hooked by the first spare atmospheric guitar pluckings on the unfortunately-titled \\"Intro.\\" (I only complain because it seems like a dismissive title; the song is so much more than a mere lead-in to other things.) Granted, I was predisposed to like it; I'd been seduced from afar by the rave reviews, the sexy group name and album title--is anything sexier than an X? Yes, four Xs--and the cool mystique. But there's a lot of well-reviewed stuff that sounds good in the dim light of a first encounter but doesn't hold up to the morning's harsh judgment, and the harsher judgment of succeeding days.<br /><br />This, on the other hand, turned out to be one of those albums that gets better and better as I get to know it; I listen to such albums and end up almost amazed that they didn't already exist somehow; there is something primal and right about them, something sonically equivalent to a tetris piece that materialized from nowhere and fell exactly into a deep hole inside me that I somehow hadn't noticed before.<br /><br />Granted, this album works partly by evoking other great albums that have come before, all the masterpieces of shoegaze and dubstep and trip-hop; in some ways it succeeds more as culmination and synthesis than as departure. Still, it succeeds at both; it differentiates itself because it manages to be warm and cool at the same time, without being lukewarm. The music is spare and icy, a nighttime cityscape viewed through a high-rise window; the heat comes from the vocals, a male and female voice talking to each other at pillow distance or closer; they only want enough backdrop to set the mood, and no more, because they're doing their damndest to never leave the bedroom--or, better yet, the bed.<br /><br />But--importantly--it isn't the sound of love, exactly. It is many things, but it is not quite that; it is desire and codependency and lust, and the fear of how much colder it will all feel when one or the other leaves. The words aren't just the lies one hears on the radio or whispered in one's ear; they're also the real things one hears in one's head and sees written across a lover's face while their lips are busy saying other things: \\"Sometimes I still need you\\" and \\"I think I'm losing where I end and you begin\\" and \\"I'm setting us into stone piece by piece before I'm alone\\" and so on, and so forth. (\\"I'm sure you heard it before,\\" they sing on \\"Heart Skipped a Beat,\\" and if you're anything like me, you have heard it before, or thought it, or said it, or lived it--or all of the above. And you soundtracked it to Portishead, or Burial, or Massive Attack, or My Bloody Valentine, or Slowdive--but not this, because, of course, it didn't exist yet.)<br /><br />And yet it does deserve to exist, and so much more--to be a soundtrack of its own, to be noticed and obsessed over in its own right, for its own considerable strengths. The XX are bold enough to dispense with most of the drumming and thereby create something new and unique; they are bold enough, too, to keep in both the warm breath of smoky soul and whispered lies, and the cold backdrop outside--the distant city, and the realities one can't hold at bay forever.<br /><br />Still, again, this is one of those albums that leaves you crazy when you try to leave it cold. Like all lovers, it reminds you of others, and like all the best, it has its flaws, and it somehow manages to be perfect and unique in spite of them, and maybe even because of them. If you're anything like me, you might come up with reasons not to like it, or to hold it at arm's length. (I told myself that the male vocals were too mumbly, and the female ones too breathy, and that the songs were too varied in quality, because they range from \\"Perfect\\" to \\"Really Great.\\") Eventually, though, you'll find yourself wondering, \\"When am I going to spend time with xx again?\\" and realizing you just got togetheryesterday, and thinking you still need another fix anyway. And--and this is the truest test--you will be willing to forsake time with your other loves (Sorry, Joanna Newsom!) to make it happen. Actions speak louder than words, and the play count tells me more about my feelings for this album than anything I can set down here.fix anyway.

B00005V9HH|5.0|Don't be fooled by the Amazon.com review that suggests this movie is \\"convoluted\\".  Anyone who came away from watching this movie with that opinion obviously didn't get it.  The thing that is so special about the fact that all of these well-seasoned criminals are conned by a master-mind is that the audience is also completely conned.  And you don't find out the truth until literally the last seconds of the movie.  Along that way the plot twists and turns, as good plots do. The ending of this movie can only be described as awesome, because although that word is terribly over-used, it's really the only description that fits. I don't even know how many times I've seen this movie, but it never gets boring.  The best line from this movie is not, \\"Who is Keyser Soze?\\".  It's, \\"The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.\\"    Watch this movie.  You will never regret it.

0066620996|5.0|You can't go wrong adding this one to your personal library.  Jim Collins's, Good to Great, details a great many elements of sound business practices.  The overriding message of the book is the constant re-evaluation of the company's strengths.  Excluding Circuit City and a few others, the companies covered in the book learned to deal with bad information honestly, changed direction because of it, and turned lemons into lemonade. The CEO's of these companies also deserve a lot of credit for setting aside their egos to turn the organizations around.  Add this one to your library because it's worth it.
B001OQCV2O|4.0|Movie - 3.0    When I first saw this in theaters I had somewhat high expectations. The only previous Emmerich films I'd seen prior to this were Independence Day and Godzilla. Given my limited experience to his work, but with remnants of nostalgia from ID4 (loved it as a kid), I went in expecting this same kind of formula: an element of doom that threatens humanity (malevolent aliens, or in this case the end of the world), people uniting in response to that threat (after the damage had already been done, of course), and in the process exposing humanity's faults for what they are, therefore, eliminating our differences and bringing us closer together as a people. I caught on to this back in the theater, but naivety got the best of me and I think my change in tastes over the years (it's been about a decade since I've seen either of those movies) has caused me to over-analyze Emmerich's latest film. To be blunt, I hated this movie the first time I saw it. The cheese, campiness, ostentatious melodrama, and writing problems bugged me. Now? I don't think it's as bad as before. Despite this movie being a little longer than I'd like, I actually found some very profound themes on a subsequent viewing: mortality (how we take life for granted), selflessness (or vice versa, if you look at all the snobbery throughout some of the characters), and just the very fact of how disconnected we are as a species (which Emmerich tries to build through the many, many characters and their relationships throughout the film, but never really succeeds in fleshing out). The special effects are spiffy and I'm really starting to like Chiwetel Ejiofor as an actor. Maybe I found these themes by accident, but turning my mind to \\"popcorn mode\\" actually made said themes a little more impacting overall. With that said, these themes are still too unfocused than can make up for all the cheese and \\"fun,\\" but I can say I actually like the movie at least a little more than I disliked it before. If I had to summarize the movie, I'd say \\"go popcorn, but expect a few surprises.\\"    Video - 4.5    Sony presents us with an excellent 1080p picture in an original aspect ratio of 2.35:1 framed at 2.39. Colors are especially prominent and diverse throughout the film ranging from very accurate skin tones to lush landscape views and, of course, meteorological destruction. This is complimented by outstanding contrast levels making explosions, smoke, and all that other CG anarchy look flawless. Black levels are also handled near-perfectly, though I think I saw a little color banding through some of the darker-lit scenes. Sharpness, details, textures, and line delineation are also spot-on, adding a great sense of depth and HD pop to the film's presentation. Water during the tsunami scenes in particular stand out to me the most and, despite the weak writing, are amazing to look at from a visual and aesthetic point of view. All the crumbling buildings, fireballs, and earth-splitting are certainly a sight to behold. If at least not for the corresponding reference audio, this is a demo-worthy disc to showcase your HD home theaters for video as well. Which brings me to...    Audio - 5.0    These days in Hollywood, mayhem usually begets a very strong and active sound field. 2012 is no exception to that as Sony's DTS-HD 5.1 track is every bit as frenetic and chaotic as what you're seeing on the screen. High and low ends are reproduced perfectly. Grinding gravel, shattering glass, the rumbling earth, molten lava, gargantuan tidal waves, vehicle engines, and every other discernible sound effect add an extra level of realism that make the special effects so much more enjoyable. The sub-woofer stays relatively quiet pre-Apocalypse, but when that crust displacement thing starts kicking in, you'll be happy to know that sub you bought is earning its money's worth. Dialogue also stays clear throughout the entire film, never losing consistency in volume level. Separation of said dialogue and all the special effects noises are never a problem either, with directionality giving a very spacious feeling to said destruction all across the sound board. Again, like the video, this would make an especially good reference BD to wow and showcase to your friends.    Extras - 3.5    As much as I like to give commentaries a listen for whatever kind of extra information on production or writing that they have, I'm going to be honest and say I don't think I have it in me to sit through this movie two more times for both a P-i-P and audio commentary track. After watching the standalone featurettes on disc 2, I find Roland Emmerich to be something of a paradox. He seems like a very detail-attentive director who takes pride in his craft; that craft for this particular movie being a spiffy visual feast of destruction, mayhem, and a sort of child-like imagination in the way those ideas come to fruition. However, unlike a Michael Bay or Jon Turteltaub who both possess that \\"big kid director\\" kind of approach to movie-making, I feel Emmerich lacks in general enthusiasm as a whole, at least that's the feeling I got from the interviews here. And to sit through two and a half hours of that blandness twice is just not something I'd rather use my free time for. That being said, I give Sony a lot of credit for putting these extras together. A good majority of them focus a lot on production and the ego of Emmerich and his \\"master technique\\" for making epic disaster films (of which only one really stands out to me at this time), while the rest of the features are tied into the whole Mayan Calender and impending Apocalypse craze. I found these parts to be interesting at some points, but then blatantly insulting at others. For a movie about the end of the world that supposedly uses scientific \\"truth\\" and reasoning for a believable premise, the \\"experts\\" interviewed here are more than adamant to the point of either saying \\"it could happen,\\" or as that one scientist said \\"it will happen [andthat I've been right all along because this movie is so well-crafted by Emmerich, how can it not be the truth?].\\" On top of that, he goes on to use the excuse that the reason most regular people won't believe his theory is because of a subconscious defense to the \\"fear\\" that our lives will, indeed, end when he says it will according to the Mayan Calender. Take from these segments what you will, but after such a brazen display in ideological put-downs that nearly defeated the purpose of the movie for me, I have to say it's a strange array of extras that gets an A in effort, but a C in continuity and bias.    Overall - 4.0    I didn't like the film so much the first time around, but was surprised upon a repeat viewing. For me, I like movies that manage to have a little bit of everything: good production values, an engaging story and/or characters that, when aptly put together, make for some semblance of entertainment or thought-provocation, and a good cast of actors/actresses. 2012, while on the extremely high end of production values, also has a surprising amount profundity with more or less cookie-cutter archetypal characters, though with a good performance by one Chiwetal Ejiofor. Consequently, the presence of many an absurdity represented by some of the supporting/unnecessary characters, cheesy screenplay, silly script, and unfocused attention to some of the finer details in the writing ruin what could've made this a much more fulfilling and epic Apocalypse film. I wish I could say this is more than another popcorn flick and a definite must-own title outside of its reference A/V presentation, but I consider this a rental at best. However, if you're happy enough with the popcorn mentality and aren't bothered by some of the movie's faults, then this is definitely worth adding to your collection.

0321543726|5.0|Even though I rated this book as a 5-star product, there are questions that I have about it. First of all, even though I understand the author is not trying to teach C++, it's still unclear why he decided to create his own header file (std_lib_facilities.h) in order to teach programming for beginners. This is how a beginner thinks: he thinks that every programming language has built-in tools that he could use in order to write a simple program. Then he starts reading a C++ book and finds out that he needs to add an iostream header file to his first simple program. He finds out that the iostream file is not a part of the C++ language, yet he knows that the file needs to be added to his early programs. Then he starts reading the book I am reviewing now and finds out that a beginner needs to add a header file called std_lib_facilities.h to his first program. Even though the std_lib_facilities.h file contains the info about iostream and other files, he wonders who's teaching a real C++ and who's teaching a fake C++. Is it Stroustrup who's teaching a real C++ or is it other people who wrote C++ books for beginners that are teaching a real C++? Yes, I understand that Stroustrup is only teaching programming in this book, but how is a beginner supposed to know that the tool he's using for programming is real or fake?   I am running Gentoo Linux and don't have Windows installed, so I am a bit confused on how to compile and link his C++ file that requires the FLTK library. He says in his book that we should read a specific documentation to find out how to do it, but I think a beginner wouldn't be able to understand anything from such a documentation. That's why I believe he should have explained in his book to linux users how to compile and link his files with FLTK.    But the book is a 5-star product nonetheless!
B002V0WN2K|4.0|I have been wanting to see Bon Jovi live for a long time. Finally got a chance to see them at a filled-to-the-roof, beyond packed house at Staples Center in L.A. Floor seats were amazing!  (Note to S. Gage- sorry you missed it buddy!)     Bon Jovi were promoting this album and played \\"We weren't born to follow,\\" \\"When we were beautiful,\\" \\"Work for the Working Man,\\" \\"Superman Tonight,\\" and a slew of other hits from their previous albums. Plain and simple, Bon Jovi has transcended decades like very few other bands have.  He said it himself, \\"This isn't 1984 anymore, it's 2010. And its unbelievable that we're still packing joints like this!\\"  And that's a testament to their music.  I had only downloaded \\"We Weren't Born to Follow\\" when amazon offered it for free. But 2 days after the concert I came back and go the whole album.  Though it's not Bon Jovi's greatest, it is still a great Bon Jovi.

Where is he, why is this place filled with nothing but teenaged boys and why can he remember nothing specific about his life prior to the box? Once a month a new boy is sent up through the box where he is taken into the Glade and trained in several jobs to find each boys strong suit. Thomas shows up no different than any other 'Greenbean' or 'Greenie' (new kid) but less than 24 hrs later the alarm sounds again notifying the boys that another person is coming up in the box... only this time when it reaches the top, it's a teenage girl and she's in a coma. She has a message for the boys that Everything is going to change.<br /><br />The days to follow the girl and the message lead to many strange occurances in a place where things are always in Order and on Schedule. They must solve the puzzle of their captivity in order to find the Creator of their locked up world and fight for their freedom. Is it worth fighting for anymore or is the world outside even worse than the maze they exist in now where you must avoid being stung by terrible animal/machine creatures that what nothing more than to steal them away and tear them apart? Without a memory of their life before the Glade, none of them truly know what they are fighting to get out to... just what they are fighting to get away from.<br /><br />The Maze Runner is the first novel in what will be a trilogy written by James Dashner. It takes place in a dystopian society where teenage boys with a strange dialect seem to be in charge and running things pretty smoothly. Thomas shows up and wants to be a \\"Runner\\", the people that run the maze to find an exit. He doesn't know why he wants to do it because it's extremely dangerous, but deep in his gut he is driven to this job in particular. Thomas's character is not very well developed but since he has no memory of who he is prior to the box all we know is the integrity and strength we see as he performs his daily tasks and through his eyes we get a better glimpse of some of the other characters, like Minho, Chuck and Newt.<br /><br />Unlike most YA genre books there were no romantic ties at all in this book, that was a good change for me. It moved along at an Ok pace and had enough action and drama, I suppose, but it seemed to lack something for me. I really had to force myself to finish the book so I could see how it ended and I found myself skimming the pages a lot just reading the dialogue. The story was different and new but not anywhere near the calibre of the Hunger Games trilogy, another dystopian series I very highly recommend.

B00003CXDB|3.0|I liked several other Oliver Stone movies a lot and figured that with this great cast, that this would be an exciting film.  Perhaps it was better when it first appeared.  Now, we all know about the weaknesses of Wall Street greed so there's no surprise there.    Michael Douglas was good as the quintessential bad guy.  Martin Sheen was good as the quintessential good guy.  Charlie Sheen is the son, vacillating between the two, like Faust, wondering if he should sell his soul to the Devil or not.  Well, he does and, if he had been played by a better actor, we might care.  Perhaps Charlie has matured as an actor since this debut performance; I don't know because I've never seen him in anything since.  However here he is terrible.  I suspect that if he had not been his father's son, he never would have made it in the business.  I only wonder how such a good actor as Martin could have spawned such a bad actor as Charlie.  Well they both have good hair.    The problem with having such a poor actor as the guy who carries the whole film is that he never engages our sympathy.  He has no ability to do anything besides act cool, and that gets old real fast.  It was obvious from the first, that he was going to get burned in this deal and I kept thinking that it couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  As his father says in the end, maybe some jail time will do him good.      Darryl Hannah, who is very good in other films, is terrible here, too.  All in all, I can't recommend it.

B000056C6L|4.0|First, this Japanese remaster definitely improves on the sound of the original, though the limitations of the source show - there is still more background noise than on the excellent Virgin remasters of the follow-up albums, \\"Angels Egg\\" and \\"You\\". The best songs - \\"Radio Gnome Invisible\\", \\"Zero The Hero and the Witches Spell\\", and the exquisite \\"I Am Your Pussy\\" are worth the price of admission, IMHO - but the song/jam \\"Flying Teapot\\" gets cut down a notch because of the silly ending - and the other two songs are pure filler. For a new Gong fan, I would start with \\"You\\", then \\"Angels Egg\\" - then if you really like what they are doing, pick this up to show where the Radio Gnome story begins. I really would rate bewteen a 3 1/2 and a 4 compared to the other two. But if you like the band, this is the version of this album to get.    By the way, for those who have no idea what the band is about, it is a hippy/new age story with a great deal of Australian whimsey, set to a sound that is definitely psychedlic, but with true musical ability - which really shines on the next two albums, as this is sort of a transition album leading from the much more quirky early years to the more musically coherent next two albums.    Recommended, but realize what you are getting into!
B002T9H2LA|1.0|Ok -- I really enjoyed the Kill Bill series and Pulp fiction was pretty good, but this movie was just plain stupid.    No plot, sick humor, one of those movies that both the girlfriend and I agreed was the worst.    I can't believe I wasted $1 to rent this, left alone what is the US coming to slating this as a potential Oscar nomination.    Stupid is as stupid does and just goes to show how stupid the movie industry is.  Those that rated this highly should get their heads checked.  Either you worked on creating this POS or you are screwed up in the head.    No plot, no plot, and just lacking entertainment value.      Can I get my $1 refund?

B001UV4XX8|5.0|I do not get the bad reviews for this movie at all. This was very interesting and far above the teen slasher crap that is so popular. I guess it's not a movie unless you see boobs and dead teenagers. This movie was interesting because it posed a simple thought. What would you do if you were offered 1 million dollars to simply press a button with one hitch? Someone you don't know dies as soon as you accept it. Will the law of Karma be upheld? Can you live with the guilt? There are many spoilers in the reviews so I won't post any here. If you like something beyond most of the shallow junk thats out there you will like this movie. My only issue. Only women were the ones that pressed the button. Why? Are women weaker and more shallow than men. I don't think so.

So, we'll be hearing the built in XY microphone on the unit as well as a pair of AKG 414s which I positioned above the piano, pointing into the open lid.<br /><br />\\"Kodak Zi8 Internal Microphone\\"<br />Here we hear the internal microphone on the Zi8. Mono, a bit noisy and perhaps a little too close to the piano to capture a clean sound. In any case, this does the trick for capturing an idea, but definitely doesn't cut it if you're looking for high-quality audio.<br /><br />\\"Zoom H4n XY Microphone\\"<br />Here the stereo image opens up suddenly. This XY microphone which is built into the unit is capturing a very natural, coincident stereo sound. It's a very reflective room, so you hear that, as the microphone is about 15 feet from the sound source.<br /><br />\\"Zoom H4n Pair AKG 414s\\"<br />Here we're hearing the pair of AKG 414 microphones pointing into the piano. Because the microphones are very close to the sound source, there is significantly less \\"room\\" sound. This would be more suitable for a studio recording, while the XY sound would be more appropriate in perhaps a classical or field recording.<br /><br />\\"Zoom H4n Mix of XY + 414s\\"<br />Here we have the best of both worlds. We have a blend of the direct signal from the 414s AND some of the room sound from the XY microphone. I believe this is the best overall option in most scenarios.<br /><br />Finally we return to the Zi8 internal microphone to hear the major difference when using external audio equipment. At under $200, I believe the Zi8 does a great job capturing the visual and at under $300, the Zoom H4n does a remarkable job with the audio.<br /><br />[...]rall option in most scenarios.<br /><br />Finally we return to the Zi8 internal microphone to hear the major difference when using external audio equipment.

6304342160|3.0|Bound is an \\"Okay Movie\\",it's only worth watching if your a guy who enjoys the stuff :) the story is typical, the love scenes if you can them that aren't not that much. and Frankly watching a butch and a pretty girl is pretty gross. Jennifer Tilly is beautiful ,yet Gina Gershon(clinton buddy) is gross in the film. then there's Joe Pantoliano(Risky Business,The Sopranos) he's pretty good in the movie. Overall it's worth watching albeit on skin-a-max.

B002X9W50E|4.0|This is a wonderful live album.  Bowie has an excellent band, and the performances are top-notch.  Of course, the newer material is good rather than great, and I dock it one star for that.  The versions of the classic songs are outstanding, especially \\"All The Young Dudes\\" and \\"Five Years.\\"  This album is worth buying for one song alone:  \\"Under Pressure.\\"  Bassist Gail Ann Dorsey sings Freddie Mercury's part, and her voice is just phenomenal.  I got the CD two days ago, and I've already listened to that track about twenty times in my car.  This is a must buy for any Bowie fan.  It may not be quite as good as \\"David Live\\", but it's an excellent piece of work.
B0034GK7DM|5.0|Nashville finally signs someone that is actually a country music artist.  This guy is great!  I feel like it's been 10 years or more since we actually heard a traditional country artist.  There have been quite a few new artist over the years who started out country, but Nashville slowly changed them (album by album) to a more contemporary sound. This guy is a star, but I hope he sticks to singing true songs from his heart and not what Nashville tries to push down his throat.

B002WY65VU|4.0|First, if someone ruined the surprise cameo in the middle of the movie shame on them- they are no friend of yours.  Secondly, this movie is just great fun- I'd put it in the same category as Jaws- it's not ambitious and it's not going to change your life but it sets out to tell a certain kind of story, in a certain kind of way and by staying true to the story and tone it achieves a kind of perfection.  The cast is just perfect- the direction finds the perfect mix of laughs and scares.  I went into this movie hoping to just pass the time and left it with a huge, huge smile.

B002WY65VU|5.0|A cowardly shut-in named Columbus is forced to join up with a seasoned zombie slayer named Tallahassee in order to survive the zombie apocalypse. As Tallahassee sets out on a mission to find the last Twinkie on Earth, the duo meets up with Wichita and Little Rock, two young girls who have resorted to some rather unorthodox methods to survive amidst the chaos. Reluctant partners in the battle against the undead, all four soon begin to wonder if it might be better to simply take their chances alone. This movie really hits the mark with the humor. Although it is a very funny movie, it never lends itself to being a true comedy because it is filled with scares and violence. The movie is just a bit short, but is certainly entertaining. The real stand-out performance, though, is Woody Harrelson as the Twinkie-lovin', zombie-hatin' Tallahassee. A great movie with laughs from beginning to end.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This movie is a must watch for every person in the usa.  I really didn't understand how much our supermarkets have changed in the last 50 years.  If you want your eyes opened WIDE to the truth then watch this film. I have loaned it out to everyone I care about, because to be ignorant is dangerous. I've had an allergy to beef for the last 15 years and never knew why.  I am buying grass fed beef now and have yet to have any reaction, which tells me its not beef but maybe the hormones or antibiotics or the ammonia they wash the beef in or maybe the dye they use to make it look red. If you care about your health and the future of our country this is a must purchase.
B0010X745K|5.0|After a strong storm in the Maine area, the local artist Dave Drayton drives from his house nearby the lake to the supermarket with his son Billy and his arrogant neighbor, the lawyer Brent Norton, to get supplies. Along their way, they see a heavy mist and later, military convoys, police and firefighter trucks, ambulances heading toward it. While in the supermarket, a frantic bleeding local arrives crying that there is something alive in the mist and the manager closes the entrance door while the place is encased by the mist. When David, another client and two employees go to the back of the store to start the generator, they open the back-door and the cashier Norm is hold and dragged by fierce tentacles. David and the two survivors succeed to close the loading door, and when they tell the people what happened, Brent does not trust on his words and believes it is a prank and the God-fearing woman Mrs. Carmody preaches the Apocalypse and that she is the vessel of Lord on Earth. Sooner the group discovers that they are under siege of blood thirsty creatures from another dimension that have reached our planet through a window open by a failed military research. Further, the crazy Mrs. Carmody has many followers and is becoming dangerous and dangerous in her speeches. Without alternative, a small group leaded by David decides to take the chance to escape from the supermarket and reach his car, hoping to get out of the mist. \\"The Mist\\" works as well as a traditional horror movie, with several genuinely scary sequences. This is a masterful suspense/monster movie that puts an ensemble cast into the untenable situation of being in a deteriorating situation they cannot escape from. Highly recommended.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Death Magnetic is the first studio album by Metallica in 5 years and it more than makes up for St. Anger. They went back to their thrash metal roots which they have been doing hard rock since 1991's Metallica/The Black Album. There's a lot of progressive elements in it like \\"And Justice For All\\", in my opinion it's their best since then. Black Album was their last really good album for a long time but Death Magnetic surpasses it even. Their last few albums had some good songs and I found them underrated but Death Magnetic is their most consistent album in 2 decades. Opening track, That Was Just Your Life is a lot like Battery or Blackened. Starts off with an acoustic intro and then goes into all-out thrash/progressive metal, no nu-metal or southern rock. The End of The Line is another great track, this one's a lot like The Black Album. Broken Beat and Scarred is one of the best tracks and in my opinion the best single released. Cyanide and All Nightmare Long are some other good heavier, thrashier hits along with the slower ballad The Day That Never Comes. There's even an instrumental which they stopped doing since the early '90s, Suicide And Redemption. The Unforgiven continues with #3 which I only really care for the first but it's better than the part 2. The Judas Kiss is another solid track. Then after hearing an album full of great tracks ranging from thrash metal to ballads and getting a break with an instruemtnal, the comes another heavier metal song My Apocalypse which is the grand finale.<br /><br />Everything is up to standards here, great guitar solos/riffs from Kirk, excellent drumming and Lars' best in years, James Hetfield still sings well in his late '40s and Robbert Trujillo is a great bassist. Better than Newsted and possibly better than even Burton. The band admitted that they liked his bass playing more than Cliff Burton's (1962-1986) and it's hard to replace a legend like that. The production isn't bad, it's not perfect and it's a little raw but it gives the album a heavier edge. Rick Rubin did a decent production. Album art is interesting and makes it worth owning a physical copy. I'd have to compare the album to ...and Justice For All but with a hint of The Black Album. If you were disappointed by their last 3 and have given up on them, make sure you give Death Magnetic a listen.t gives the album a heavier edge. Rick Rubin did a decent production.

B00003CY6M|5.0|Jonathan Tragger meets Sara Thomas by chance in the Christmas eve, in Bloomingdale's, both trying to buy the unique pair of black gloves available for sale. They decide to go to the cafeteria Serendipity and Jonathan asks for her name and phone. Sara decides to write it in a book, and his on a five dollars bill. She gives the bill to a newspaperman and she says that she would sell the book in a New York used books store. She states that if destiny wants them two together, Jonathan will get that book back. Or she will receive that bill again. From this day on, Jonathan will 'chase' Sara's book trying to reach his lost love. Cusack is so likable, and manages to convey the bedevilment of his situation with such facility, that the viewer is unequivocally drawn in from the beginning. The other half of the equation for success, of course, belongs to Beckinsale, a good actor who infuses her character with a touch of mystery and complexity that makes her winsome and interesting. Cusack and Beckinsale make it work.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|There are very few filmmakers that can be called true genius, i.e., De Sica, Fellini, Kazan, Houston, Leone, Wertmuller, Kubrik, Pechinpah, Woo, Tarantino, Cameron, Emmerich, Scott brothers, Bay, Zwick, Allan, Stone, all masters of their craft. A great fan of Tarantino, I expected to be entertained and I was, even thrilled by this action-suspense-fantasy which God only knows every Jew wishes had been the truth. It's well documented that after WWII, members of the Jewish Brigade made up of fearless Palestinian Jews who served in the British army in Italy, tracked down Nazis and killed them, and Israel managed to grab Eichmann and execute him after a lengthy trial, but most Nazis, indluding the Angel of Death Dr. Mengele got away with their crimes, so in the least this film gave those who suffered at the hands of the Nazis some emotional satisfaction.<br /><br />Historically in Hollywood, Jews have been portrayed as weaklings, ugly, big-nosed, bookish, nerdy, fat, ugly, and greedy. But with the emergence of Israel and its kick-ass army, the image of the Jew is changing as evidenced by Tarantino's film, Munich, and Defiance. There are many American-Jewish heroes that unfortunately the public is unaware of, i.e, one of America's best tank commanders, General Maurice Rose who commanded the 1st Armored Division in Europe, and General Mark Clark were Jews, and who can forget the great Sandy Kaufax, the Dogers strike out king, or handsome gangster Bugsy. During WWI, the greatest ace fighter pilots of the German airforce were Jews, known as Knights of The Sky, and today very few fighter pilots can match the brilliance of Israel's Top Guns, and Israel's vaunted commandos, paratroopers, tank commanders, i.e., Kahalani, Raful, Sharon, Natanyahu, Barak. Furthermore, it's no secret that as many as 50% of all the actors and actresses in Hollywood are Jewish (see famous Jews of Hollywood on YouTube), and are mostly very handsome and beautiful, yet they play mostly non-Jewish characters. When casting Jewish characters (with very few exceptions, i.e., The Young Lions, Tobruk, Porky's, Independance Day, Munich, Defiance, German Oscar winner Nowhere In Africa, Israeli Oscar nominated Ajami, etc.), Hollywood casting directors and shameless ignorant producers seek out and cast the ugliest people alive, often played by non-Jews. Other than the anti-semitic definition, there is no such thing as \\"Jewish looking\\". With the exception of the Eastern European and Middle Eastern ultra-orthodox, Jews can easily blend in anywhere. Eli Cohen, who looked like Omar Sharif, was an Israeli spy who was days from being named Defense Minister of Syria when he was caught. First mayor of Montery California was a Jewish Conquistador. Ashkenazi Jews have European features, and the Sephardi (Spanish, Middle-Eastern origina) Jews look like Arabs (or their desert warrior biblical forefathers). Put a Palestinian Arab next to an Israeli whose family may have originated in Iraq or Morroco and one cannot distinguish the difference. And then of course there are the beautiful black Ethiopian Jews (and American Hebrews who settled in the city of Arad near Beersheba) and dark skinned, Yemen born Jews. In Israel they inter-marry resulting in an exceedingly handsome and beautiful stock of Jews.<br /><br />Inglourious Bastards is a pure adrenalin-rush Tarantino film, which means excellent story-telling, excellent character development through great dialogue, terrific characterizations and excellent perfomances, off-the-wall humor, tremendous over the top cold-blooded comic book violence, and perfect pacing as he throws in a good measure of the-edge-of-your-seat suspense. I've seen True Romance, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, Kill Bill I & II numerous times, and I LOVED this movie, and as indicated by it's world wide gross of $333 million it's a major hit, not only in the US but all over the world. It's a must see.<br /><br />Lastly, it took a non-Jew to make a positive film about heroicJews. When will the Hollywood and Israeli Jews start making films that project the Jews as they are, viril, tough, good-looking, smart, sexy, and as proven by Israel, great warriors?l the Hollywood and Israeli Jews start making films that project the Jews as they are, viril, tough, good-looking, smart, sexy, and as proven by Israel, great warriors?

B000026KG7|5.0|Here, the first lineup of Deep Purple found the footing that, interestingly enough, would be the Mk 2 lineup's stock in trade.  Even so, the approach here was still eclectic, as one can tell from the opening strains of \\"Chasing Shadows,\\" wherein Paicey proves himself one of rock's best drummers (and to this day, still one of the most underrated) with what sounds like about 20 tracks' worth of African percussion.  My only complaint with this track is the abrupt ending, as if the engineer ran out of tape while the band were still going strong but didn't catch it until after.  \\"Bird Has Flown\\" still has some of the Hendrixian influence that was apparent on Shades of...; it reminds me a bit of Jimi's \\"Stone Free\\" (which is not necessarily a bad thing; both tracks have a great hook that doesn't let you go until the fadeout).<br /><br />Of the bonus tracks on this expanded edition, \\"Emmaretta\\" is my favourite; this one could have been done with the Mk 2 lineup, although Ian Gillan's vocals would lend a different dynamic to the band's sound.  \\"April\\" should take its place as one of the best examples of early progressive rock ever committed to vinyl.<br /><br />For those wishing to explore Deep Purple, I recommend starting with the Mk 2 albums, most especially Machine Head, then first working backward, to get a sense of what came before, and maybe after that working forward to the Mk 3 (with David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes taking over for Gillan and Glover, respectively) and Mk 4 (Tommy Bolin replacing Ritchie Blackmore) lineups.  If you're a casual fan, probably better to just go with the 2000 compilation Very Best of Deep Purple, as it does the best capsule version of Purple's best-known material.  But with Purple Passages long since deleted, there is no better way to experience Purple Mk 1 other than diving headfirst into Shades, Taliesyn, and the eponymous 3rd LP.
B00275EGWY|1.0|This movie was horrible. No wonder the Soldier the movie is about is suing. I would too. They made his character completely reckless. The very first scene has a humvee driving through the crowded streets of Baghdad all alone, no convoy. My husband, who has been to Iraq twice for a total of 25 months, was livid. He said no way do you go out alone! That was just the beginning of extremely inaccurate circumstances. Don't waste your time, and if you do, don't think this is the real deal.
B00005QFE5|5.0|There are movies of love and romance that are subtle reminders that the smallest of details may carry totemic significance. In THE ROAD HOME Director Zhang Yimou tells of a story that is so delicate in its nuances that the slightest of facial expressions or the merest whisper of singing is sufficient to carry a film that for a Westerner may seem glacially slow paced but for those who can appreciate the subtleties of shy love, the wait is not for action but for more nuance.  Zi Yi Zhang, who later went on to fame in CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON, is Di, an eighteen year old girl living in the smallest of rural communities somewhere in the vastness of China during Mao's Great Leap Forward of 1959. Her story is actually the middle part of the film.  The beginning and the end occur forty years later and relate the journey of Di's son, now an adult, who returns home to visit his mother only to learn that his father has died recently.  The older Di tells him that she is bound by custom to walk with her husband's coffin over many miles for a burial. Her son naturally objects that due to her age, the cost, and the brutal winter, such a trip is daunting.  During his visit, she tells him of her courtship by the newly arrived teacher, his future father, and it is his telling of the tale through his mother that forms the bulk of the movie.<br /><br />THE ROAD HOME seems a superficially simplistic tale of young love set amidst a rural life that is light years from the cultural chaos then afflicting China. Though this is a love story, the lovers never kiss, never even touch physically. What they do is look at each other.  Most of the camera is on her face.  We see numerous closeups of Di waiting and watching for him to return after he is called away for possible political interrogation in the big city.  He gives her a hair clip as a parting gift which she wears with all the proud equivalency of an engagement ring.  Di spends much of the movie either running after him as he is taken away from her or simply standing around waiting for him to return as he has promised. The film is replete with many cinematic symbols of delayed love.  The water well of the village contains the life giving liquid that will later unite the two.  A bowl is broken as she drops it while running after him.  A master pottery repairman unites the shards, foreshadowing a similar unification of the lovers.  The rural school house is first built, then falls into disrepair, then is repaired yet again.  Then there is the road of the title.  This road exists in both a literal and metaphorical sense.  It is eternal even if those who tread its cobblestones are not.  As the young Di runs up the road seeking her man in the middle part of the film, she as the older Di walks slowly with great dignity as she accompanies her husband's casket on what will be the last journey for both. Director Zhang shows a deft hand in showing the various transitions from past to present to past again.  While Zi Yi Zhang gets the lion's share of screen time, the actress who plays her as an elderly widow invests her role with a quiet dignity.

B001OQCV2O|1.0|After seeing this in the theater, I really wanted to see this on Blu-Ray. Yes, the story is complete tosh, but the visuals and sound were amazing. Unfortunately, after loading the disk it played thru the Sony BR commercial and the two previews proceeding to the 'splash screen' where you would normally find the menu options (Play/Scenes/Settings/Extras).<br /><br />There was no commands!!! I tried the FF & Skip Forward buttons on the screen (remember, this is using the HP DVD Play software) and on my remote. Nothing. Enter on the keyboard & the OK button on my remote had no effect. the splash sceen just repeats, and repeats, and repeats, and repeats, and repeats, and repeats...<br /><br />So I updated the player software, thinking that might be the issue. Again, no effect. Changed the aspect ratio from 16x9 to 4x3 - same thing, no menu commands. Tried the standard single disc BR (from a local retailer) and had the same issue. I'm heading to that local retailer to test them both out on a BR player they have there.<br /><br />I called that store & the clerk said \\"I'm not the first person to have this issue\\" and that he \\"has seen three other customers return the BR copy.\\"<br /><br />Oh, and the update from HP disabled the HD-DVD playback on my PC... that's a whole other kettle of fish, but it was definitely salt in the wound!<br /><br />Looks like the folks at Sony didn't do any testing on this batch of BluRay discs or the aspect ratio translation puts the menu BELOW the video instead of IN it.
B001PU8N0I|4.0|I bought this specifically for Matthew Macfayden who did a great job as Arthur and Claire Foy also was really good as Little Dorritt.     It is beautifully shot with great costumes, sets and score.      Honestly the beginning and the end are really good but I did get bored in the middle. I agree with some of the reviews that say that this story is a little too long. I haven't read the book but I did have to look up a synopsis of the book just to figure out what was going on halfway through it! If the book was just about Arthur & Little Dorritt and not so in-depth about the other characters, I would consider reading it but I really don't need anymore information on her father, sister, etc.      I would definitely buy it again just because of my love for Matthew Macfayden but I don't think I will watch the entire thing again. I think I will pick certain parts and watch those over again.

1558216847|1.0|I am an avid reader of non-fiction adventure stories. Based on the positive reviews of The Long Walk, I was anxious to get my hands on a copy and dig in. Now that I have read it, I must say that it was a real disappointment. This book is not for any objective reader expecting an authentic non-fiction adventure story. If you're just interested in distracting yourself with a bizarre adventure fantasy, and are willing to forget reason and ignore the outright lies, then you might like it. But it is definitely not a true account of the author's experiences as trumpeted in the subtitle and text.     Rawicz (through his tabloid journalist ghost writer, Ronald Downing) makes countless outlandish claims that are not supported by any witnesses, documentation, or even detailed descriptions on his part. Moreover, his assertions often defy the laws of science and common sense. Here are but a few examples:     - reaching his destination after wandering a year through 4,000 miles of wilderness with no maps, supplies?  - trekking 12 days across a torrid stretch of the Gobi desert in mid summer with no water or food?  - crossing the Himalayas, summiting mtn after mtn in only worn moccasins and a few ragged articles of clothing?  - encountering a yeti and taunting it like those guys in the beef jerky commercial (no joke-it's in the book!)?  - Rawicz's inability to provide the most basic details about his ordeal such as the first name of one of his closest companions on the trek (the American, \\"Mr. Smith\\"!) or where he was finally picked up by the British Army or the hospital he claimed to recover in?    the list goes on and on...     The BBC did an investigation into Rawicz's story and also concluded it was a fraud. They found gov't documents showing that Rawicz was sent to the Siberian gulag for murder (which may or may not be true, but why would he lie?), not trumped-up spying charges as he claims. Soviet documentation also shows that Rawicz was released from the prison camp underAmnesty (along with other Polish prisoners) granted by Stalin in 1942 - so that these prisoners could be used to fight the Germans in the Middle East instead of chopping wood in Siberia. In a letter to the BBC, even Rawicz's own children appear to concede that his account was fictional. I want to emphasize here that my intent is not to diminish the true stories of those who may have survived or escaped from Siberian prison camps during WWII,  but this fabrication does more to cast doubt on actual survival stories than legitimize them.       For those interested in fascinating, true, and compelling adventure and survival stories, I recommend the following well-documented accounts: Don Starkell's `Paddle to the Amazon', `The Journals of Lewis and Clark' (edited by DeVoto), and `Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage'.

055358894X|4.0|If you've ever wanted to read a fun caper set in a medieval fantasy world, this is it.    Story  The Lies of Locke Lamora is a medieval fantasy novel that follows a group of con artists called the 'Gentlemen Bastards.'  In most fantasy novels, rogues will cut a coin purse for three silvers.  Maybe they'll dash out of a tavern without paying for ale.  Sometimes they pick locks and steal some precious trinkets from pompous nobles.  But the 'Bastards' are rogues on an entirely different scale.  They use disguises, deception, and complex plots to swindle nobles out of thousands of gold coins.  If you like caper stories or movies like Oceans 11, then you'll probably enjoy this book.     Writing Style  There are two storylines in the book.  One in the past, and one in the present.  This book switches back and forth between the two.  The past storyline gives insight and background information on the present storyline.  The present storyline moves at a fun pace, because you already have the background information.  It works very well.  Scott Lynch is a talented writer and does a great job at writing action, humor, intrigue, and suspense.    World  The World is similar to Renaissance Venice with a magical history.  There are mysterious glass towers created by an ancient race scattered throughout the city.  There are some very creative uses of alchemy and sorcery, and the fiction behind the magic is grounded in rules.  This isn't one of those books where characters have \\"magical do-anything powers.\\"  The magic systems are explained to the reader and they are interesting.  A web of canals and waterways exist throughout the city and foul creatures inhabit the dark water.  Outside of the murky depths, there's a criminal underworld far more dangerous than the things that dwell in the deep.  All of the settings are original and interesting.    Characters  Without spoiling anything, I'll just say that the characters are well developed.  Because of the dual storylines, you learn thehistory of all of the main characters and how they became the Gentlemen Bastards.  They're all very clever and have distinct personalities and senses of humor.  Most of them are pretty likeable.    Action  The action is pretty good.  It's not epic, but you have a good sense of what's going on and it's pretty exciting.  There are brawls, duels, and scuffles, but no castle sieges or massive battles.    Maturity  There's quite a bit of swearing, but there isn't any over the top violence or sex scenes.  There's some blood and death in the action, but it's not overly gory.    Overall  This is a fun, fast paced, caper, featuring some interesting characters in a well crafted world.  There's some very entertaining dialogue, too.  This book is more of a crowd pleaser than an epic masterpiece.  It's fun, but not great.    Buy this book if you want to read about a bunch of extraordinary con artists in a fantasy world.  Buy this book if you can appreciate a well thought out world.  Buy this book if you just want to read a fun story with a few twists.  Avoid this book if you like traditional fantasy with elves, dwarves, dragons...  Avoid this book if you like your heroes valiant, stalwart, and true.  Avoid this book if you like epic tales of heroism.    If you enjoyed this book, you may want to check out The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss.    (And vice-versa)
B000005RU2|3.0|This is one of my all time favorite albums but when I put the record on my turntable and the CD in my CD player and listen to them back to back, the record sounds so much better. It is night and day. On the CD the cymbals aren't there, the depth isn't there, and the recording is overall lifeless. I tried to record from the record to a CD and my CD sounds way better than this so called remastered edition. To me this CD is unlistenable.
B001FB55HQ|3.0|I watched this movie, expecting a better storyline. There was less story and more special effects though. To me a movie is always a let down when that happens. I won't spoil it for you by telling you anything specifically in the movie. I will say that you can watch this without seeing any of the other terminator movies or The Sarah Connor Chronicles series and you will be able to follow with no problem. All in all I gave it 3 stars. Then again my views might also have been affected by my physical condition while watching the movie, as I have recently injured my back, and been laid up for over a week. Anyway, the movie is a great form of escapism, the action is almost non-stop as is the case with most terminator movies. I just wish there had been more to the storyline. It felt too gappy.     Rod
0691142165|3.0|This is like reading Moby Dick: lots of data, not easy to get through, but you don't want to miss it.  I thought the listings of failed government economies over the last two hundred years was the most valuable part of this book.  Some countries never seem to get it and are \\"chronic\\" bad boys with bad financial policies and failing currencies multiple times.  The data is global covering all continents and listing the major players.  The safe places over the years despite the great depression:  The United States, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada.   This book is especially important with the financial crisis in Greece and unprecedented US government debt.  This is the type of book that you should read carefully and then take it to Washington and beat the crap out of our government representatives and senators.

Of course I like all the songs. I think she is daring, but not to an extreme. I'm a child of the 60's so I've seen it all. You would be buying a CD that you can listen to the entire CD and say WOW I liked it all. I hate buying a CD and only one song catches me. Not so here, it's all good. Get it today and keep listening. Keep singing Lady GaGa and I'll keep buying.

B00005K9LM|5.0|This album defines 1980s British Heavy Metal. There isn't a weak song in sight. Glenn and K.K.'s guitar work is super-tight throughout, especially their solos, which are mindblowing in both precision and power. Check out 'Love Bites' and 'Freewheel Burning' to see what I mean. The rhythm section is sound. As for vocals, there's not really a lot you can say...except that Rob Halford is the one and only Metal God.   Every metal fan should own this album. If you don't have a copy, then buy it now!  Buy it.  Play it loud.  Repeat.

It is a refreshing re-presentation of the essential teachings of the Buddha on the very human challenge that we all face - the balance between the world of conditioned \\"things\\", the emotional-thought products of the small mind, the ego, and the unconditioned dimension of pure spacious awareness that is our actual true nature and the fabric of our being. Eckhart gives us the practical insights to \\"break through to the other side.\\"
B00005K9LN|5.0|By 1980, Judas Priest had been flying the heavy metal flag for almost a decade, but had not achieved any real mainstream success. This was the album which changed that forever. The track 'Metal Gods' could not have rung more true; that's precisely what JP became with this release.   It was the peak of the NWOBHM (New Wave of British Heavy Metal). Saxon, Diamond Head, Def Leppard, Iron Maiden, Praying Mantis and co. were making valuable and creative contributions to the genre. Judas Priest, however, eclipsed them all with 'British Steel'. Priest were in a league of their own.   Unashamedly metal, the album boasted three huge hit singles in 'Breaking the Law', 'Living After Midnight' and 'United'. The other tracks are heavier without sacrificing any of Priest's trademark twin-guitar melodies.   Importantly, this was the piece of work which finally made a serious impact on America. After too long in stateside obscurity, Judas Priest were finally able to headline stadium shows in the US, where - deservedly - they became a household name.   This album, along with Black Sabbath's debut, Rainbow's 'Rising', Zodiac Mindwarp and the Love Reaction's 'Tattooed Beat Messiah' and Type O Negative's 'Bloody Kisses', defines heavy metal.   Buy it! Buy it! Buy it!
B002B4OVWG|5.0|I only wish my newborn would take a pacifier because this would be the one. We used these for my second son, and yes, it does help keep it in much better, but my biggest applause for it is that we only bought two of them!! With other pacifiers, we bought so many of them b/c they would fall somewhere or get lost and it was just ridiculous. We much have bought 20 pacifiers for my first son, which equaled more than the two WubbaNubs together. I absolutely love these, and like I said, am a little sad my newborn won't take one.    My second son also used the animal like a lovey, so not only did he always have his hand on it, which kept it from landing on the floors while out, but he also learned to put his pacifier back in really easily and really fast.
B00127RAJY|3.0|I would consider myself new to working out and to cardio especially. I have been doing mostly weight training for the last 6 months or so, and I realized I needed to do a lot more cardio if I wanted to lose more weight, so I gave this a go.     Very hard for beginners or overweight people. I had to stop and rest a number of times, and this was just on level one. Haven't even made it to level 2 yet. She relies on lots of jumpy movements (jumping jacks, jump squats, etc) and by the end of the workout on day 3, my knees and wrists needed a break. Very hard on the joints unless you have a very thick mat underneath.     If you don't have a problem with joints, this will certainly get you sweating!
B001OQCV2O|4.0|If you don't like to spend an entire movie sitting on the edge of your chair, shouting \\"Oh no, oh no, oh no!\\" Then this isn't the movie for you!  But if you enjoy such suspense and adrenaline packed adventure, then this is perfect!<br /><br />First, the acting was fine.  But this isn't what this movie is about.  Excellent actors were cast and did their job, but what made this film really good was the incredible special effects.  If there were a few story holes or the storyline was a bit simple (we were able to predict with 100% accuracy who would die and when, and sometimes even the coming facial expression or last words -- it was pretty predictable) -- who cares? We felt like the plot was comfy old shoes to rest in while we watched awesome effects.<br /><br />The premise is that in 2012, the world will end.  That is no spoiler.  But how it happens is well worth watching.  California drops into the sea!  Tsunamis cover India and most of the world.  Will anyone survive?  Watch and see!
B00275EGWY|1.0|I never thought a film about bomb disposal could be as stunningly slow, uninteresting and uninformative as this piece of garbage. it also manages to kill the two best actors it has within minutes of them appearing. Jeremy Renner is a hack who should never have been nominated in the 1st place. this film is a joke on America by a woman who up until recently has made some really good (BLUE STEEL, NEAR DARK) to excellent (STRANGE DAYS) films. she shouldn't have listened to her ex James Cameron on this one.

B002JCSWV6|5.0|Clint Eastwood was probably the only filmmaker who could produce a film on Nelson Mandela that centered on a side event that became a major initiative in the history of South Africa and the world. He chose to center the film on the Springboks and their victory in the World Cup of 1995. That was a brilliant idea since it showed Mandela as a real transformer of human beings. It also brilliantly proves man does not make history. A certain thickness of imbecility was needed to pile up in the minds of some not to see that the enslaved majority of the South African population could not remain slaves for ever. Let my people go. The choice, if it is a choice and not the only logical sequel of the fifty preceding years that Mandela does was to center his own action on a sports event that could unify the people in a victory. And we can see how little it takes to attract the attention and the heart of the other, a cup of tea for instance served by the President to his guest François, like Jesus washing the feet of his disciples before the Last Supper, though forgiveness is not that easy, and yet easier for the victims of the bad treatment than for the people who inflicted that bad treatment. Those had to become aware of the hardship of that treatment to finally be conscious enough to forgive themselves and to forgive the victims. Clint Eastwood then adds some symbols to strike our eyes: the little black boy carried by the white cops on their shoulders after the victory. The green Springboks cap Mandela is wearing at the end, not as a provocation of the All Blacks, but as a symbol of his support to his team and as a symbol of the unity of the country around their team. This film is first of all emotional for us who have lived these dark years and harbored for a night or several some AWOL special force soldiers who were deserting apartheid. And how many pages of ANC press releases have we translated for the whole world to know about their fight. And yet we wonder at the end who is the main character of this story. Nelson Mandela or François Pienaar. This appears clearly in the remarks these two exchange when Mandela gives the cup to François. \\"Thank you François for what you have done for South Africa.\\" \\"No, Mister President thank you for what you have done for South Africa.\\" And the green Springboks cap Nelson Mandela wears all the time is not a provocation to the All Blacks, but the sign of his support to his team, and the symbol of the reunification of South Africa thanks to that sports event. Then the answer François makes to the journalist when this one asks him if he was encourage in his fight by the 63,000 people in the Stadium, is prophetic: \\"We were not supported by 63,000 people but by the 43 million South Africans.\\" That makes us very humble in front of history that no one can stop, than some can only slow down, ,and some others encourage and help in its own direction. And we will forget Henry Kissinger's answer when he refused to support Nelson Mandela, the political prisoner that he accused of being a communist. One of these details in history that get lost in the pages of some encyclopedia and then is forgotten by humanity.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGIDis the main character of this story.

Between the horrible anachronisms, unending similes and the totally unbelievability of the protagonist I just could not take it anymore. Even da Vinci, Einstein, Edison, Benjamin Franklin, Salk and Bobby Flay rolled into one, would not be as perfect as the main character in this story. If you don't want to waste your time, don't read it. Almost anything else would be better.

B001OQCV2E|5.0|One of the best computer silmulation base scenario film. You should know - this not a psychological film, this is not just another one catastrophic film. This the film based on the computer simulations. The charachters, psychology is only a background of it and the least important. Pure computer scenario schould show you shot by shot the following computer simulation events without any actors, only pure effetc and numbers like that 6hrs - 4 mln death toll, 12 hrs - 1 bln toll, panic everywhere, 48 hrs - 5 bln toll, no countries at all; free Cape of Good Hope, some lands in South America. 72 hrs 1 mln survived. Claps. The next shots will show you appropriate simulation of a civilization rebuilding. It is to be understood that dialogues are only a filling and the conntections between the next shots. And they are quite well. The authority actions are shown as they are. Thus, very good simulations and good observations.    Next time the director might think of a team of specialists caring of proper mass behaviour, political actions corectness, military actions corectness, physical and geological (seismic) corectness. If the film budget is about of 100 mln $, thus hiring mass behaviour psycholgists, ex-soldiers, seismologists, physicists, doctors, politologists, retired politicians isn't that expensive and the film gains the true reality. The natural continuation of 2012 is 2013 - Civilization Rebuilding. If you can show destruction, very probable, show the construction, too. As for the physical reality of the film: we don't know exactly the neutrino production mechanism in the Sun. Thus, it may happen the stream of it will rise suddenly, and during neutrino oscillation some electron neutrinos may transit into other types that may be dumped very stron by liquid iron that makes Earth's core. By the way, the first direct observation of an electron neutrio done by Cowan and Reines in 1959 in CERN was by means of large amount of the very iron that makes the Earth core. The whole Swiss iron supply was used in that experiment. Finally, the film is unlike others where brave American boys save the world from unavoiding disaster. The disaster touches the Catholic Hierachy, too. And the God permits that situation, which is very embarrasing to them, they are awaitnig for God's save and they are awaitnig for nothing. As many Polish priests during World War II who died in concentration camps. They were not saved from death, but if you asked them in the 19th century if it would be possible they would very probably deny. Thus, the physical idea of the catastroph is valid, but very little probable. But, the film doesn't discuss the probability - the case happend. In my opinion the film deserves two Oscars: for original scenario and for the special effects. Moreover, as the other people noticed, Emmerich together with other new directors created the new branch in the cinema art - a computer simulation base scenario film. But to make the films more realistic and more didactic many specialists from different science areas should be employed. And such a movie should be made in 3D with octophonic sound to position the film sound very precise in the space so that other viewers would hear different voices from different part of a cinama hall (they will have to attend the film many times to collect all experiences). And one more answer for the question why there was not a tsunami when the California cliff fell into the Pacific Ocean. Do the experience: submerge very slow and very fast something big into your bathtub. Then, you will find the answer.

B002VECLVY|4.0|A SINGLE MAN<br /><br />STARRING: Colin Firth, Julianne Moore, Nicholas Hoult, Matthew Goode and Jon Kortajarena<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Tom Ford and David Scearce; based on the novel by Christopher Isherwood<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Tom Ford<br /><br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Drama<br />Release Date: 11 December 2009<br /><br />Who would have thought it would take Colin Firth playing a gay man for me to appreciate him as an actor? Colin Firth has stepped away from his typical romantic comedies and dove into a film, very much deserving of its Oscar nomination. He plays George - a man who is having trouble getting over the death of his lover Jim (Mathew Goode).<br /><br />There are a lot of times when you see an actor play a role, and you think they did a good job or maybe even an excellent job. But it's far rarer of an occasion, to find yourself honestly believing that this part was specifically meant for them, and that no-one could have played it any better. Colin Firth does exactly that for me, as George.<br /><br />He never really flips out in anger over the fact he's lost his love, nor does he seem to dwell on it emotionally, to the point of crying or breaking down. It's simply there behind his eyes in every scene.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the scene where he uses his relationship and the fact that he is a gay man in a society that hasn't quite accepted that yet (the 60s), as a metaphor to his students in one of his classes. Most of them don't catch onto this at all, but one does. Kenny (Nicholas Hoult), feeling trapped with his identity as well, sees this in George and is quick to act on it.<br /><br />The two of them have amazing chemistry together. While it's not what floats my boat, it's interesting to watch them interact without being too forward, for fear of scaring the other off. The film doesn't beat it out of them, but I think it's safe to say by its end, they have taught each other a thing or two about one another.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: Keep an eye out while watching the scenes with Kenny. The film never reveals this to us, but I got the feeling that it could be taken that Kenny is a figment of George's imagination. It just seems odd that we never see him interact with anyone else in the film, except for a girl he sits next to in class. Their quick conversation could have also been in George's mind. Who knows, it could be in my mind.<br /><br />Julianne Moore was robbed of an Oscar nomination as George's best friend Charley. She's a woman who, like George, left England long ago, and often fantasizes of going back. The two now live in Los Angeles and are both insanely lonely. Charley wants there to be more to their relationship for sure, but that's just not going to happen.<br /><br />We meet George's lover Jim, in a series of flashbacks throughout the film. It serves much better seeing him this way, versus perhaps having spent the first act with him, and then having him die. Their scenes aren't cheesy and aren't in your face with the gay, so you can relax, if this bothers you.<br /><br />Overall, the film wasn't great, but it was pretty darn good. It could have used a little more something. What exactly? I don't know; something more in the second act I think? It seemed a little slow between the death of Jim, and George starting up with Kenny. I wouldn't have minded a few more scenes with Julianne Moore in them either. Of course, that could just be the straight in me talking.his to us, but I got the feeling that it could be taken that Kenny is a figment of George's imagination.

B002RDCEX4|5.0|I ordered this album before it was available as an mp3 download on Amazon, when it was classified as an import, and I had to order the physical disc. I'm glad I did, because I've spent the past few months enjoying it! The tracks on this album I would rate the highest are Science of Fear, Soldier On and Sweet Disposition, though others are starting to grow on me as well. Like many Americans, I was first exposed to the Australian group through \\"Sweet Disposition,\\" which appeared on the 500 Days of Summer soundtrack. My husband and I saw the movie together, and both of us remarked about Sweet Disposition specifically as we left the theatre. We hurried home and downloaded the soundtrack, which included great tracks by several artists. A few weeks later I downloaded The Temper Trap's first single from the Album, the Science of Fear - and I've been falling for them ever since! Be sure to visit the band's lyrics page for Science of Fear to learn about the sound sampling used on that track. I won't ruin it for you, but now that I know what the sampled sound is, the meaning and emotion of that song is forever changed for me. I recommend this album very highly! Happy listening!
B002UXRGLG|5.0|...... themes covered include : fertilization/mating, parenting, predatory behaviour, predator evasion tactics, group behaviour and adaptive behaviours. The cinematography is exhilarating - extraordinary close-ups, gliding aerial/panoramic shots, slow motion photography, underwater sequences and some occasional time-lapse photography. British naturalist and broadcaster David Attenborough brings his gentle authority and understated wit to the narration. The music score complements the visual scenes; it is never intrusive, and it allows for a balance between music and natural sounds.<br /><br />The programme's creative input and production values are unmistakably those of the BBC Natural History Unit - it is both entertaining and educational. 'Life' is more focused/structured than 'Planet Earth', and its presentation adopts a more sober approach to the subject matter (but this is not a criticism). It was 4 years in the making, and was shot using high definition technology throughout. There are 10 episodes each an hour long including, at the end, a 10 to 15 minute 'on location' review which draws attention the various challenges presented to the film crews, researchers and producers - and although there is some duplication of scenes already presented in the main body of the episode, they are given a different slant. Menu options provide for episode selection plus 6 scene selections from each episode.<br /><br />There are innumerable sequences which will enthral the viewer - some never captured on film before; below I give just a few examples (one from each episode) to convey an idea of what is in store :<br /><br />Disc 1 : Challenges of Life, Reptiles & Amphibians, Mammals<br /><br />The courtship dance of grebes (Oregon); A pair of Komodo dragons fighting  (Indonesia); A clan of hyenas forcing a pride of lions to retreat from feeding on their prey (East Africa).<br /><br />Disc 2 : Fish, Birds<br /><br />The interaction of barbel fish and hippos (Kenya); Lammergeiers exploiting thermal air currents (Ethiopia).<br /><br />Disc 3 : Insects, Hunters and Hunters<br /><br />Male Dawson bees fighting to the death (Australia); Bottlenose dolphins working as a team to corral fish (Florida Bay).<br /><br />Disc 4 : Creatures of the Deep, Plants, Primates<br /><br />Giant Australian cuttlefish mating; Bristlecone pines (the oldest living thing on Earth)/bamboo (the fastest growing plant on Earth) - both featuring time-lapse photography; The social pecking order of Macaque monkeys relaxing in the warmth of a thermal spa (Japan).<br /><br />'Life' is a top drawer natural history documentary from the BBC, and one which should not be overlooked - there is little with which I could find fault.exploiting thermal air currents (Ethiopia).<br /><br />Disc 3 : Insects, Hunters and Hunters<br /><br />Male Dawson bees fighting to the death (Australia); Bottlenose dolphins working as a team to corral fish (Florida Bay).<br /><br />Disc 4 : Creatures of the Deep, Plants, Primates<br /><br />Giant Australian cuttlefish mating; Bristlecone pines (the oldest living thing on Earth)/bamboo (the fastest growing plant on Earth) - both featuring time-lapse photography; The social pecking order of Macaque monkeys relaxing in the warmth of a thermal spa (Japan).<br /><br />'Life' is a top drawer natural history documentary from the BBC, and one which should not be overlooked - there is little with which I could find fault.

B00005QHV5|5.0|Gunther Wand only achieved significant renown toward the end of his long life. He insisted on prolonged rehearsal time and is said to have been a difficult, depressive  personality. His repertoire centred on the classics (Beethoven, Schubert, Brahms) as well as Bruckner. Hearing this cycle of Beethoven symphonies proves to be a consistently satisfying experience. The interpretations are vital, solid, middle of the road (in the best sense of the term) and expertly phrased; I could not say that any of the performances was below a highly satisfying level of execution.<br /><br />A bonus is the natural, clear, warm and well balanced sound. The NDR Symphony Orchestra is an excellent unit and sound top notch. Of course the serious music lover would have multiple sets of this inexhaustable music (search out the Bruno Walter 1940's cycle with the New York Philharmonic as well as the usual suspects like Karajan 1963 and Klemperer). But if you are seeking a well performed modern recording of the Beethoven symphonies, you will not go wrong with this Gunther Wand set.
B001HN694K|5.0|\\"Alice In Wonderland\\" is great! This is how the story goes: 19-year-old Alice returns to the whimsical world she first encountered as a young girl, reuniting with her childhood friends: the White Rabbit, Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the Dormouse, the Caterpillar, the Cheshire Cat, and of course, the Mad Hatter. Alice embarks on a fantastical journey to find her true destiny and end the Red Queen's reign of terror.    The cast led by Johnny Depp (in his 7th collaboration with Tim Burton) (as The Mad Hatter), Anne Hathaway (as The White Queen), Helena Bonham Carter (as The Red Queen) (in her 6th collaboration with Tim Burton) & Mia Wasikowska (as Alice) is great! The directing by Tim Burton (also produced) (who has worked with Depp on \\"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street\\" (2007, also starring Carter), \\"Corpse Bride\\" (also produced) (2005, also starring Carter), \\"Charlie And The Chocolate Factory\\" (2005, also starring Carter), \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" (1999), \\"Ed Wood\\" (1994, also produced), \\"Edward Scissorhands\\" (1990, also produced and wrote the story), has worked with Carter on \\"Big Fish\\" (2003) & \\"Planet Of The Apes\\" (2001) is great! The screenplay (based on Lewis Carroll's books) by Linda Woolverton (also co-produced) (who also did the screenplay to \\"The Lion King\\" (1994) is great!    The music by Danny Elfman (who also did the music, recently to \\"The Wolfman\\" (2010), he has been doing the music to Burton's films since \\"Pee-Wee's Big Adventure\\" (1985) is great! The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski (who also did the cinematography to all 3 of the Pirates Of The Caribbean films including the new 4th film, \\"On Stranger Tides\\" (2011), he also did the cinematography to \\"Eagle Eye\\" (2008), \\"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street\\", & the upcoming \\"The Rum Diary\\" (2010, also starring Depp) is great! The film editing by Chris Lebenzon (also executive produced) (who also did the film editing to Burton's films since \\"Batman Returns\\" (1992) is great! The casting by Susie Figgis (who also did the casting to \\"Sleepy Hollow\\", \\"Charlie And The Chocolate Factory\\" & \\"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street\\", she also did the casting to the upcoming \\"Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time\\" (2010) is great! The Oscar-winning production design by Robert Stromberg (who also did the production design to \\"Avatar\\" (2009, for which he is nominated for an Oscar) is great! The art direction by Tim Browning (who was an assistant art director on \\"The Wolfman\\"), Todd Cherniawsky (who also did the art direction to \\"Avatar\\" & the upcoming \\"Sucker Punch\\" (2011), Stefan Dechant (supervising art director) (who also did the art direction to \\"Avatar\\", \\"What Lies Beneath\\" (2000), \\"Cast Away\\" (2000), \\"Jarhead\\" (2005) & \\"Lady In The Water\\" (2006), Andrew L. Jones (who also did the art direction to \\"Avatar\\", the upcoming \\"Green Lantern\\" (2011) & \\"The Adventures Of Tintin: The Secret Of The Unicorn\\" (2011), Mike Stassi (who also did the art direction to \\"A Christmas Carol\\" (2009) & was an assistant art director on \\"Avatar\\") & Christina Ann Wilson (was an assistant art director on \\"Big Fish\\" & did the art direction to \\"Shutter Island\\" (2010) is great! The set decoration by Karen O'Hara (who also did the set decoration to \\"A Christmas Carol\\") & Peter Young (who also did the set decoration to \\"Batman\\" (1989), \\"Sleepy Hollow\\", & \\"Charlie And The Chocolate Factory\\") is great! The Oscar-winning costume design by Colleen Atwood (who also did the costume design to Burton's films since \\"Edward Scissorhands\\") is great!    This is a great film, visually beautiful. This is another well-done film from Tim Burton, which this seemly enough, fits him. This is another hit for Depp & Burton.
B0033QEUGS|5.0|These new Slavo remasters of the Nazareth catalogue are superb: they feature fantastic sound, excellent liner notes, killer bonus tracks, and historical accuracy.  So far, Salvo has remastered and rereleased everything from the first Naz album through \\"Hair of the Dog,\\" and these are all well worth picking up.  As for \\"Hair of the Dog\\" itself, the Salvo version preserves the track listing of the initial UK release, which has a great cover of Randy Newman's \\"Guilty\\" in place of the now mega-famous cover of B. Bryant's \\"Love Hurts,\\" which the record company added to the US release at the last minute in the interest of trying to land a smash hit . . . which they did, of course.  For my money, the originally intended cover of \\"Guilty\\" (included here in its proper spot as the third track) makes the album much more interesting and dark, but for those who side with the record company, don't worry: \\"Love Hurts\\" is included as a bonus track, along with lots of other fine material.  No serious and self-respecting fan of hard rock should spend any amount of time on planet Earth without owning \\"Hair of the Dog,\\" and this is the edition to buy.
006176759X|5.0|Being a teenager I was interested to read this book but not totally interested. So, I ended up buying it anyway, but I couldn't put it down! It was that good. Sure there were parts that were really slow, and language it was still a great book. I've never been a fan of Lauren Conrad but I am now! I don't watch The Hills or Laguna Beach, so I don't get interaction with her. But I do like her as a writer. I did know that she was on The Hills and had appeared on Laguna Beach so I didn't know what her books would be like. I like that an actual actress has written a book (with more to come) and we don't get fake images of Hollywood these are more real. So if you like teen fiction definetly pick this up. It's a good spring break read!!
B000N3SSVM|5.0|This is an excellent deluxe edition at a great price! I am new to The Knife (thanks to Fever Ray) and this was the first album of theirs I purchased. It's worth every penny even if you already have the initial album. Peace out.
0785134352|3.0|This is no \\"Ultimates\\", it's no \\"Fantastic Four: World's Greatest\\", it's certainly not the average \\"Old Man Logan\\" and \\"Wolverine: Enemy of the State\\", either.<br /><br />This is Millar doing \\"badass\\" Millar stuff, like having kids kill people, humans do heroics (like we've not seen Hawkeye do it before, mind you), exploding eyeballs, and other things.<br /><br />If you like Millar, you'll like \\"Kick-Ass\\". If you have a take it or leave it approach to his work like some of us fans, this one pretty much falls in the leave it. It's not \\"Superman: Red Son\\". I saw more awesome stuff from Mark in both \\"Ultimates\\", and the currently running \\"Ultimate Comics: Avengers\\" series.<br /><br />If you like JRJR's acquired taste (sometimes, it is) art,  you'll probably dig his art here more than his last few lackluster projects. It's much better than his \\"Wolverine: Enemy of the State\\" work, which looked like paper dolls were the art's source.<br /><br />I realize he has a large fan base, and he does good, but he also has some stuff that leaves a bad taste in your mouth or a noncommital \\"Meh\\". I think \\"Kick-Ass\\" is one of the \\"meh\\" moments. Decent stuff, I loved the art, but there's not really nothing new on the table (After all, we saw youngsters kill in comics and films plenty of times)<br /><br />There's a movie coming out, which is bound to hype up the trades ala \\"Watchmen\\". But \\"Watchmen\\" didn't give us a trailer a week like the basis of this comic has, and it was still pretty lame.
B00003CWRX|5.0|i sometimes think of that final list of the finest movies i've ever seen.  after much soul searching and viewing films for over 50 years,  i narrowed it down to amadeus, private ryan, manchurian candidate (frank sinatra), high noon and no country.  after everything shakes out,  THE INSIDER would have to top the list.  acting, directing, music, script and subject matter.  i just wish it was on blu ray.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|What can be said about this film that hasn't already been? Anyways, James Cameron knows what he's doing with any movie he makes and everything in Avatar is expertly crafted by him down to the smallest detail.  One of my best movie-going experiences ever.
B001NXBRJG|5.0|Has it really been 10 years since the matrix brought new meaning to my life? Even without the blu-ray and special features, any serious movie collector should have a copy, the current format makes it all the more worthwhile.     Everything is crisper and fresher than you could possibly hope: help erase your horrible memories of 2 and 3 by returning to \\"the one\\" that started it all.
B002HFWAWW|5.0|Originally, I saw a review that stated that the Canadian release of Equilibrium removed the black bars and zoomed in on the picture. This is not so. Though both the U.S. DVD release and the Canadian release state 2.35:1, only the Canadian Import version delivers. The DVD does have black bars, but those black bars cut some of the image off. The Canadian release, by Alliance, removed the black bars and presents the whole picture, which looks pretty good. The sound is also excellent. Though both the picture and the sound can be improved upon, it's a nice addition to any sci-fi or action blu-ray library, if this is your type of genre. But again, the Canadian import includes more of the original image, not less of it.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|If you're thinking about buying 300, you already want it for the action and special effects: I don't think anyone needs to reflect on the plot again.    The blu-ray did the best parts of 300 justice: felt like we were in the theater again. Relive the insanity!
B0034JKZ3G|5.0|The Disney Studio has made a return to its hand-drawn roots (with the aid of some computer technology of course) with its first hand-drawn animated fairy tale in many years. It is also the first time the studio has set one of their fairytales in America. Tiana (voiced expertly by Anika Noni Rose of [[ASIN:B000O179FO Dreamgirls[Blu-ray]]]) is a young girl in 1920's New Orleans. She is focused on making her late father's dream come true of opening her own restaurant; this leaves no time for love or fun. Enter Naveen of Maldonia, a handsome prince who has been disinherited by his family for his laziness. Tiana and Naveen are brought together even though they are polar opposites because of the black voodoo magic of the evil Doctor Facilier. The two are forced to journey together to get what they both think they want...which naturally changes along the way. No plot spoilers here...this rich movie needs to be experienced personally. Although I am generally not a Randy Newman fan, his music here is memorable and toe-tapping. New Orleans provides the perfect atmosphere for the music showcased here: love songs, blues, jazz, and more. You will end up singing more than a few of the wonderful tunes you hear. My very favorite number is \\"Almost There,\\" which is sung by Anika's Tiana as she helps her mother (voiced by Oprah Winfrey) envision her dream restaurant. This sequence is done in an art deco poster style and just blew me away.<br /><br />The hand animation is also memorable; the frogs come to life and you believe the emotion that they express; the eyes...the smiles...the movements, all delicately rendered with time and love by the Disney animation team. New characters also join the classic library of Disney: Mama Odie (the blind voodoo priestess), Charlotte (a rich girl looking for her prince voiced by Jennifer Cody), Ray (a firefly in love with Evangeline the Evening Star), and Louis (trumpet-playing alligator). A trumpet playing alligator? Sure sounds stupid, but the animation team pulls off every unbelieveable thing you could imagine with their talents. On Blu-ray, the lush painted backgrounds bounce off the screen, and the music will make your speakers rock. Note of caution; as with almost every Disney movie, there are some dark and very sad elements. Parents should definitely be nearby for the young ones.<br /><br />Specs:<br /><br />Bluray is 1080p High Definition/1:78:1 with English 5.1 DTS HD Master Audio (48kHz/24-bit) * French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital * English SDH and English 2.0 DVS, French and Spanish Subtitles. Bonus features on bluray are 1080p High Definition/1:78:1 with English 5.1 Dolby Digital * English SDH, French and Spanish Subtitles.<br /><br />Bonus Features: Quite a few here shown in high definition on blu-ray; interestingly enough though, the clips from the older Disney library are still in low pixelized quality.<br /><br />-Deleted/Alternate Scenes: with introductions by co-writers/directors Ron Clements & John Musker. These are shown in rough storyboard form with \\"scratch dialogue\\" (not voiced by the actors in the movie). 4 scenes are shown: \\"Advice from Mama,\\" alternative version of Louis' introduction, \\"Stop and smell the roses,\\" and \\"Naveen confides in Ray.\\" The last one is the only one that I would say is missed; it is a different version of what is scene on screen of how Naveen reveals his feelings to Ray (and the audience) about Tiana. It is more touching and tender than the final version. The other deletions were made wisely!<br /><br />-Music and More: \\"Never Knew I Needed\\" music video by Ne-Yo. Shot in New Orleans, this really has very little if anything to do with the movie. Ne-Yo is shown romancing a girl, and other than them eating beignets and seeing the evening star at the end, there is not much of a connection to the film. This is the one musical number that really doesn't fit stylistically; mercifully it is shown over the credits at the end.<br /><br />-Bringing Life to Animation: liveaction reference footage is shown and introduced by Clements & Musker. They stress that this footage was not traced, but used as an aid and point of departure especially for the dance numbers. See the live footage for \\"Dig a little Deeper\\" (Mama Odie's showstopping number) and Charlotte's proposal scene. Very interesting to see how the movements of the live dancers and actors inspired nuances that translated to the animation. Sherry Butler, in her 20's, takes on the role of dancing Mama Odie the voodoo priestess.<br /><br />-Audio Commentary by Musker, Clements, and producer Peter Del Vecho<br /><br />-Magic in the Bayou: The Making of a Princess (22:11): Excellent featurette! Executive Producer John Lasseter tells of how he wanted to bring back hand-drawn animation to the Disney Studio, and accomplished this by bringing back Musker & Clements. Don Hall, in charge of the story, relates how the classic elements of a fairy tale were twisted here, such as the typical fairy godmother becoming Mama Odie, the sassy voodoo priestess. Mark Henn, Tiana's supervising animator, tells how difficult it was to convey a frog without having the frog look ugly. A similar situation was handled back in 1940 with Jiminy Cricket in \\"[[ASIN:B001ILFUDM Pinocchio]].\\" New Orleans is a character itself, although the animation team stylizes it as well. Because of the choice of New Orleans, the rich \\"gumbo\\" music (a plethora of styles) fits like a glove here. Animator Eric Goldberg tells how they painted what it \\"feels like\\" to be in New Orleans, capturing its essence rather than some of the uglier details. Anika Noni Rose is pleased to be part of the production that uses African-American characters; she correctly feels that it's important for ALL people to be able to feel the \\"fairy dust\\" fall on them too. Thrilled to work for Disney, she talks about how they have a way of teaching children about hope, dreams, and perseverance. She also wisely tells us how this movie isn't necessarily about finding a prince as it is about finding love, whatever that is for each person. You'll also see Betsy Baytos, the choreographer responsible for the \\"eccentric dance\\" (comedy in dance) of Mama Odie and the other memorable characters.

076781326X|3.0|Oliver!: 5 out of 10: A musical is often only as good as its music. And on that front Oliver Twist, in particular the first half, is a winner. With large musical numbers seeming starring every single person in England, Oliver! simply delivers. Such catchy tunes as Food Glorious Food and Consider Yourself will stick in ones head for days.    In addition Oliver! boasts both a top-notch cast (with one exception) and incredible set design that invokes both the theater roots and the ability of film in one piece.    The only problem with Oliver! musical is the source material. The original play is pretty awful. You have large dance numbers one minute and prostitutes being beaten to death by a shillelagh the next. Talk about your tone changes. The cast does well with these problems but the second half of the film simply seems like a completely different movie. And it is not an improvement. (They fortunately cut out murderous Bill Sikes musical number but Prostitutes Nancy's ode to wife beating is still in there.) In addition while the cast is almost uniformly excellent, the lead of Oliver (Mark Lester) is simply too angelic to be believed. He comes across as a Nambla poster boy. He seems to be watching everyone around him with a worried bemusement as if he was in the audience with us.    Of course the moral of Oliver! is that everyone belongs in their own station. Oliver is discovered to be a nephew of a rich family and so is reunited with his station, the Artful Dodger having poor parentage stays a thief, and the prostitute ends up dead.     One last note many concerned parent groups today would demand an R rating for Oliver! Between the copious tobacco smoking and snorting by young children (Not to mention stealing) to the on camera prostitute killing parents with fuzzy memories may be shocked how adult this version really is G rating or not.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, it has violence, and scenes of blood, BUT it is rated R, so take note of that.  Brad Pitt was absolutely great in this movie, and I looked forward to hearing his witty remarks, but noting his very serious demeanor.  Along with a very talented cast, they told a story that was ingenious, and well thought out.  This movie made me laugh out loud, and also cry real tears at times.  I recommend this movie to anyone who remembers WW2, and would like to see a different take on the outcome, and also be truly entertained at the same time!!!
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I cannot vouch for the DVD yet, but for the Season itself I can only my opinion.  I first thought the show was like a fantasy Star Wars (Young guy gets a sword from a wise old mentor after a woman in a white dress asks for help-- but as I watched the show I became more enthralled.  This show has humor and emotion and action enough to staisfy.  I also loved that the season finale made this season stand on its own.  For those unfamiliar with the story, it really could have ended with *SPOILER* the deafeat of Darken Rahl.  Luckily for us fans, it goes on in Season 2 as our little band searches for the Stone of Tears.  This show got me reading the Sword of Truth books-- which might be why I enjoy the show so much.  My advice is to appreciate the books for what they are and appreciate the show for what it is.  No media interpretation of a book has ever been 100% faithful to it's ink and paper counterpart, but in this case I think it's a good thing (can you imagine Richard's training at the hands of Denna o screen?  Yikes!)-- it offers the makers of the show more creative liberty.  And just because the show isn't following Goodkind's books to the letter doesn't mean that all of the important story points won't make themselves known in due time according to what has been set up on the show.  Overall, I love this show and despite what others may think, Season 1 included everything that was absolutely essential in Wizard's First Rule plus quite a bit more than just makes it more fun.  If you want the whole story, there are nearly a dozen lengthy books to satisfy your need :-)

1439190275|5.0|I just wanted to share with anyone who is considering buying the book and was wondering if it was worth it. I have all the Atkins books and this one rocks on all levels:     I finished reading the new Atkins book.    I thought it was very well done. Don't know who formatted and wrote it but it was easy to follow and understand. I liked that so much information is organized for easy reference at your fingertips.     I especially liked the explanations on Fats (Pufas, Mufas etc.) really helped clarify some confusion for me. It's also helpful to know what to buy and use when grocery shopping.     The last section discussed inflammation and I thought it was great info, again, to help clarify misconceptions. Most low carb diets do not discuss inflammation, yet it is a big player in many diseases including leptin and insulin resistance. I read a lot and there are varying opinions regarding inflammation and how to reduce it through diet. Most authors of course do not encourage Atkins. I liked that they explained it and backed it up with science. They didn't just give their take on it.    Overall the book just helped me to reconfirm that this is definitely my way of eating for life. Not just weight wise but for overall health. Kudos to the Atkins team that helped put this out. It is by far the best book on how to do the plan leveraging the orginal writings from Dr. Atkins with new scientific information.     It addressed so many issues that come up regarding low carb as a way of life. It also was helpful to \\"see\\" how the plan should work.     The only thing that was missing was MORE RECIPES!   Perhaps that's something they might consider as their next project. It would be nice to see recipes from our forum partners who are creative with applying the Atkins lifestyle and turning it into flavorful foods.     I think this is definately a hit!
B0027CSNBM|4.0|If you like the Percy Jackson series, The Demigod Files is worth your while.  Think of this as a book version of the special features on a DVD--a few deleted scenes, character bios and interviews, etc.  It's a fun read.
0446615625|3.0|Baldacci comes up with another great plot; however, it's his execution as a writer that is somewhat lacking.  There were parts of this novel that hold one's attention and you don't won't to put it down.  At other times, it seems to bog down.  One thing that this novel suffers from, like a great many other novels out there, is too many characters.  Not everyone needs to be a Tom Clancy!  David, try some first person writing exercise; they might sharpen your focus.  The many other characters detracted from the Camel Club characters.  I did enjoy the interaction between Alex and Kate -- there should have been more here.  I was totally disappointed with the lack of interaction between Stone and his daughter -- a missed opportunity by the author.  What the author didn't miss out on was the opportunity to present left-wing, anti-American viewpoints whenever he could.  It is too bad that none of his characters stand up and affirm the stuff that has made this country great.  And, David, you have some of the facts wrong about the Irag conflict and war on terror.  You should get out of Virginia and away from the beltway crowd.  It is clear that you rely on the left wing media for too much of your information.
0061537969|3.0|I'd heard great things about this book--from a family member who'd read it and from various written reviews. It pulled me in and I read it in one night (the font is very big on those 300+ slim pages), so it gets points for being engaging; I definitely wanted to know how things worked out for Denny. Yet I expected a lot more. More inventive writing. Characters who were more detailed. Less reliance on shocking plot twists. Enzo's perspective was interesting and shed an interesting light on the perspective of a dog, but the dog's narrative voice ultimately felt just like a 3rd person narration.    I think it would make a great movie, but I expected more from the writing.    (The dog on the cover looks like a Golden Retriever, not the Lab/terrier mix who is the narrator. An odd choice of an image for the jacket.)
0201721481|5.0|As pointed out in other reviews: compared to previous editions, the 4th edition of the \\"C++ Primer\\" is considerably different (and shorter). For this edition, Barbara E. Moo (co-author of \\"Accelerated C++\\"), a long-time programmer and writer, vastly revamped and enhanced Stan Lippman's (and Josee Lajoie's) classic.<br /><br />The Good: This book is over 800 pages long, and it is quite complete in its coverage, but it is highly readable. The \\"C++ Primer\\" can be used as an introductory text: the authors have interspersed a myriad of code snippets throughout the text (which they also integrated into complete working programs; these are provided on the publisher's website, packaged for different platforms). Similarly, there are exercises at the end of most sections; these are well thought out, and greatly facilitate the reader's learning (unauthorized solutions exist on the web in the form of a wiki). Furthermore, throughout the book parts of the text have been highlighted to call attention to common pitfalls, good programming practices, and important concepts. Finally, each chapter concludes with a summary and a glossary of defined terms. In contradistinction to many other popular volumes, this book teaches real C++, not \\"C with classes\\", i.e., it contains extensive treatments of the standard library containers and algorithms, of object-oriented programming, and of generic programming. For example, the coverage of the standard library in this book is much more extensive than in \\"C++ Primer Plus\\" by Stephen Prata, a book that is often compared with (or confused with) the \\"C++ Primer\\". Even so, the \\"C++ Primer\\" also covers a number of older topics such as C-style character strings, lower-level bit manipulation of integral values, and old-style casts. The material in this book is thematically organized (pointers, expressions, functions, classes, constructors, object-oriented programming, template programming, etc.). This, along with the many forward and backward cross-references, makes it a great reference both for people who have never read it, and for those who read it a while back.<br /><br />The Bad: Object-oriented programming is covered in approximately 60 pages. The coverage is solid, just like in the rest of the book, but it is condensed. For the sake of comparison: Josuttis's book \\"Object-Oriented Programming in C++\\" devotes 170 pages on more or less the same topics. In other words, an object-oriented design background, while not strictly necessary, would make reading this book easier. This aspect of \\"condensedness\\" is a more general feature of reading the \\"C++ Primer\\": even though the book is quite long, there is no filler material. This slows the reader down, so it might interfere with one's progress when using this as a first C++ book. For example, the first 300 pages (perhaps mention but) do not discuss in detail the standard library algorithms, smart pointers, object-oriented or generic programming, and other aspects of professional C++ development. A related point: I mentioned above that the book works as a reference since it is complete and contains many cross-references. A side-effect of this is that some of the earlier chapters make repeated mention of topics that have not yet been covered; that's great if this is your second C++ book (since it means every chapter is complete), but is potentially too much information for a total newbie. Finally, this book was intentionally limited to Standard C++. As a result, it doesn't talk about TR1 (a specification for functionality being added to C++'s standard library) or boost (a collection of libraries offering TR1 implementations and much more), or threading in C++. A 5th edition of the \\"C++ Primer\\" will probably appear after the new standard (still known as C++0x) comes out.<br /><br />Despite the few drawbacks that I have noted above, I believe that this is a wonderful book which deserves 5 stars.<br /><br />----------------<br /><br />Here are my suggestions on relatedreading.<br /><br />Recommended prequel:<br /><br />* Accelerated C++, by Andrew Koenig and Barbara E. Moo<br /><br />An excellent first book on C++. Goes through many topics quite fast, but is highly readable. Covers essentially all of standard C++ in under 300 pages (see also my review of it on amazon).<br /><br />Recommended follow-up:<br /><br />* Effective C++, 3rd edition, by Scott Meyers<br /><br />This assumes you have already come across all of the material contained in the \\"C++ Primer\\". It offers solid advice on numerous aspects of effective C++ development. Meyers also describes a few design patterns as well as more modern topics like TR1.<br /><br />Alexandros Gezerlis
B001GWK2MC|2.0|Purchased this an it arrived with 2 holes- USELESS!!  Do not purchase this unless you are prepared to either patch holes, or send this back at your own cost (it is heavy and EXPENSIVE to do so)!!  Purchased from CMS worldwide and their customer service is non-existant- they never got back to me.  Amazon's only fix was for us to pay to send it back.
1402726678|5.0|I purchased this book for my son's 4th grade class.  It seems to be an excellent introduction to classic literature: hard-back in a handleable size, abridged but not too simplified, text size that will not intimidate young readers, intriguing cover illustration.  Depending on your child's reading proficiency & experience, it would be appropriate for third, fourth, or fifth graders.
B001PMRBOK|5.0|Great flick in it's day.  I still watch it once a year, usually on a cold, foggy night (really sets the mood!).  Turn up the volume, shut the blinds and hold on to your chair.  I have the DVD version and hope to pick up the Blu-ray version soon.  Has anyone got a comparison of the two formats?    BTW, a reviewer mentioned a cool film fact about the Diary that Father Malone keeps.  If you watch the part where he opens it up for the first time, pause it in the first few film frames and you can read what the previous page says.  All I can say is it was definately not intended to be read by you or I!
B001KVZ6G6|4.0|Commercials can be very deceiving.  In the case of \\"Up,\\" this is absolutely true, as the previews only show a few sight gags that would be funny and entertaining to young children.  That's where fantasy ends and the serious theme of this movie begins.  IMHO, \\"Up\\" IS NOT for children under 10 -12, as it deals with the human cycle of life, including aging, and the eventual sadness involving the death of one of the spouses, and lingering depression.    This is not Bugs Bunny, where a character is hurt, maimed or killed, only to revive in the next scene.  In other words, I would classify \\"Up\\" as almost a dark drama, especially if viewed through the eyes and limited experience of a very young child.  This is a VERY good movie, despite being a cartoon, for tweens through seniors.  I would even venture that it borders on being a \\"chick flick\\" because of its emotional aspects, yet should be just as appealing to most males.  Finally, I would say, don't rent/buy/borrow this if you are looking for a cartoon with non-stop laughter, you will be totally disappointed.  Choose Bugs, Wylie, Taz, or other cartoon features instead.
1439153663|5.0|This story starts out with the prologue narrated by Lavinia. It depicts a horrible scene of a hanging. We know something bad has happened but we don't know why or to whom. The story then begins with Lavinia and Belle narrating alternating chapters. Lavinia is the young Irish girl who is orphaned on her family's journey to America and is taken in as an indentured servant by the ship's captain. Belle is a slave on the captain's plantation who also happens to be the daughter of the captain. Lavinia is sent to the kitchen house to be taken care of until the time that she can be of service. Lavinia becomes part of the family of Mama Mae, Papa George, Beattie, Fanny and Belle. The captain's family is pretty dysfunctional and plays a huge role in the lives of Lavinia and Belle. Lavinia eventually finds herself torn between two families and places in society. I like how the chapters alternate between Lavinia and Belle. The story flows beautifully between the two narrators. There is a lot going on in this book and I don't want to give the story line away. I think it is a story you have to experience and be surprised by. Trust me! It is a great story! There are times the story gets uncomfortable which makes it much more realistic feel than other books about the antebellum period. I could actually feel the fear of the characters at times. Once you get involved in the story of Lavinia and Belle you will not want to put this book down. I enjoyed this book very much and I highly recommend it. Don't read it too fast. You don't want to miss one morsel of this book. Kathleen Grissom does a fantastic job telling the story of The Kitchen House. I can't wait to read what she comes up with next!

0316067598|1.0|luttrell and his team deserve all of the accolades and honor for their service.  their story is admirable.<br /><br />luttrell's book, however, is not worth the read.  instead of focusing on the ordeal -- a drama that would easily be engaging by itself -- he devotes much of the book for uneducated and ignorant rants about liberals, the media, religion, politics and people who never served.  there are few books to which i regret the lost time spent reading and this is one of them.
0307269981|5.0|Hard to put this book down. And my friends, after reading the previous \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\", were waiting for me to do just that, so they could steal off with it to start it themselves. I have just got the last in this great trilogy, \\"The Girl who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\", and it looks like it will be as good as its predecessors. If this is your genre, you will love this novel. The main character, the irrepressable Salander, is a constant source of surprise and intrigue.

0812932293|5.0|Richard Branson's Losing My Virginity is an autobiography from his youth to 2004.    This book offers a fascinating look into Branson's world.  Branson did not do well in secondary school, never went to college, started a small student magazine, and several years later runs the Virgin empire and becoming a billionaire.  Branson starts off saying that this book is not a how-to book, however I gleaned enough from his autobiography to have an idea of how he runs his businesses.  Near the end of the book, he seems to describe how he thinks and how he approaches new business ventures.      Branson admits his is mildly dyslexia, hence is bad with numbers and statistics.  Despite his dyslexia, he relies on his gut for his business decisions.  This reminds me of Malcolm Gladwell's book Blink which is about thought without thinking, similar to gut thinking.    Of the things I noticed, Branson seems to be very resourceful.  If he needed to get in touch with somebody, such as a world leader, he would just call or write a letter to them.   He had an uncanny ability to find people to help start and run his businesses.      This book exemplifies that a person does not need a college degree or an MBA degree in order to be a successful entrepreneur.  Much of what he knows seems to come from practical experience, much like an empiricist, and not tainted by the noise of academia or intellectualism that a person might get from universities.  I don't think Branson is a fluke or a result of pure luck.  He seems to repeat his success across several markets using the knowledge he learn from experience.  There is a lot to come away with.
B001OQCV2E|3.0|Silly. Too long. Corny.  It reminded me a bit of the old Irwin Allen movies with a dash of the 10 Commandments. That's not necessarily a bad thing.  If your looking for something goofy and over-the-top it does the trick.  Of course the best thing about it is that the little doggie survives.
1400082773|2.0|So, we've been told by 99.99% of the American Media that:    Obama is not a Socialist!  Obama is not a Marxist!  No no, Obama is indeed a Centrist Democrat!    Yet before he decided to campaign for President, or Senator, or US Rep (what exactly did he actually do outside of that before we handed him the most critically important job in the world?), he candidly exposed his core ideals by idealizing a boozing, marxist, polygamist failure of a dead beat dad, his father, Barack Obama Sr.    Now, one year into his utter disaster of a presidency, one in which he has only begun to dismantle the very framework of the greatest Republic the world has ever known, it is INARGUABLE that the apple has not fallen too far from the repugnant Obama family tree.  His destruction of our wealth, his complete disregard for our Constitutional protections (ones he openly refers to as 'fundamentally flawed'), his embrace of criminals around the world bent on our annihilation, and his thinly veiled hatred for the non-black races all stem from the mad hallucinations of his drug and alcohol adled vermin of a father.  A father whose anti-human ideals were further imprinted in our president's head by his even more vitriolic minister, Jeremiah Wright, and the ideological founder of their race hatred, James Cone.    What is happening to the United States today will be lamented about for centuries.  And one day far from now, future generations will study this book, and ask in wonder, \\"how did they (us) not see what was coming?\\"
B000002KB8|5.0|Great album,perhaps Paranoid shaves it.The cover picture is the mill at Mapledurham village in Oxfordshire in England.Its a backwater of the Thames and its now been restored as a working mill.Spent a lot of my childhood playing round that area.
B002SVBDYQ|5.0|When a friend told me that the album mostly consisted of alot of Indie music, I was not impressed.  That is to say until I purchased the album.  The music varies considerably from song to song, but they all have a thread that seems to tie them together well.<br /><br />I already have been in love with Death Cab for Cutie and Muse, so it was easily given that I would love those songs (\\"Equinox\\" & \\"I Belong to You\\").  What surprised me is how much I enjoyed the other songs.  I had never before heard a solo project song by Thom Yorke (of Radiohead) and from the moment I saw the scene in the movie that corresponds with the song \\"Hearig Damage\\" I had to go buy his album.  I found other artists that I haven't really given much thought to (or heard of) and have have gone exploring for their own albums and discovered how great these bands are as well (The Killers, Hurricane Bells).<br /><br />So I feel that I have been taught a valueable musical lesson, do not assume a label defines that you will not like that genre of music.  I can officially say thanks to this album, I'm a fan of Indie(!) and I as impressed as I am by this compilation, I look forward to the Eclipse soundtrack which I will purchase without hesitation.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|So sprightly and funny and smart.  Loved the performances, especially Ms. Garai in the title role -- she made Emma come to life for me in a way nobody ever has (sorry, Ms. Paltrow and Ms. Beckinsale!).  I loved Jonny Lee Miller, too -- actually, everyone was great.  There were so many story elements that I had missed in other versions -- nice to have the luxury, via a miniseries, of making it a bit longer!    The whole thing was outstanding and one of my favorite Jane Austen adaptations ever, and that's saying something because I have really loved several of the Pride and Prejudice interpretations I've seen.    If you want a good laugh, buy this!  It's fantastic.
0375830995|3.0|The book was OK, but I didn't enjoy it as much as the one of his I read before, \\"The Book Theif.\\"  The verbal descriptions weren't as vivid, and the story was less clear.  It seems he improved as his writing progressed.  I read a book a week usually, and I didn't enjoy this one as much as many I have written.
B001UV4XWY|1.0|I was so looking forward to this movie, as I loved the Twilight Zone episode \\"Button, Button\\".  Even after hearing the onslaught of negative reviews, I wanted to see it.    Sadly, the reviews were dead on.  The movie was awful, and I don't want to waste any more of my life talking about it.
B0030MM68O|1.0|The Hurt Locker is a movie which is Virulently Anti-Military! I should of known that Hollywood could almost never make a War film that shows the courage and honor of our volenteer men and women in arms. If you despise those who die and bleed for our freedom then you will certainly like this film.
B00169N0BK|3.0|I've used this to color calibrate my monitor, but not my printer yet.<br /><br />This product has some pluses and minuses. I bought it because my new laptop has an RBG LED \\"wide gamut\\" display. The colors have a lot of pop, but they're oversaturated -  this was mostly a concern because pictures of regular people with regular looking skin would end up looking \\"deeply sunburned\\". The red in their face would be ridiculously overdone, and it looked bad and unrealistic (they didn't actually look that way in person).<br /><br />I wanted to use my monitor for photo editing, so I bought ColorMunki to calibrate it.<br /><br />It has improved that red sunburned thing, and the colors it chose have tended to be good - when viewed on other monitors, about 50% of other monitors would have colors stronger, and 50% weaker, which is exactly what I wanted.<br /><br />But there are 2 substantial drawbacks -<br /><br />1. The color profile only gets applied to certain, color managed application. And often you have to turn on color management to get that. So the more accurate colors are used in photo editing and photo viewing applications (if you turn it on), but not for the photo thumbnails, or stuff like games.<br /><br />2. While I've found the performance of the tool with regular colors to be good, the performance of the tool with low end blacks (dark greys, darker shawy areas of the image) is absolutely terrible. Rather than just being a little noisy or something, they look splotchy and perhaps \\"diseased\\". It's like the sensor gets confused with the dark colors and randomly makes similar shades to bright, to dark, to bright, to dark, etc.<br /><br />This tool has been good for photo editing - I've been pleased with the colors, I just ignore the splotchy parts. For photo viewing, though, it's hard to recommend it - the splotchy dark areas look really crappy.<br /><br />P.S. After using it for a while it's become even more annoying. I got another machine - there's no more of this \\"diseased\\" look when I could get it to work right. Unfortunately, I updated some driver somewhere or something and now the software just endless tells me \\"Unable to Set LUTs\\" every time I try to profile the display, and the new profile never gets applied. I've tried updating the graphics card driver (nvidia), even tried reformatting the entire machine. It just won't work.<br /><br />And that's not into the \\"calibration\\" step where I couldn't get past it for half an hour because every time I would push in the side of the device to set it back to profile it would insist that it needed to calibrate itself again (finally figured out if I held it in while profilling I could move it back without it interupting itself).iver somewhere or something and now the software just endless tells me \\"Unable to Set LUTs\\" every time I try to profile the display, and the new profile never gets applied.

0375704027|4.0|This is the most straightforward narrative I've read from Murakami. However his knack for crafting shocking, and revealing dialogues for his characters remain a strong force in this novel.    His protagonist, Toru, deals with the suicide of his teenage best friend Kizuki and develops a troubled relationship with the latter's girlfriend, Naoko, even as Toru struggles to manage a regular life as an undergrad.    What is interesting about Toru, from whose perspective the story unfolds, is his rather stoic and almost passive nature to the events and people around him. Things happen to him, and it feels like he lives out his experiences in a resigned manner. Goodnatured and never demonstrative of his pain and feelings, the reader gets under his skin via his relationships with the other characters, most notably the nubile and straight-shooting wannabe-nymphomanic Midori. Murakami manages to achieve reader empathy with this lonely young man with little effort.    Zany characters, always a reliable presence in Murakami's works, abound in this novel. From the OCD college roommate 'Stormtrooper' who springs to life at 6 am while doing radio calisthenics, to the ladies' man Nagasawa, to Reiko, a sage-like ex-musician with an unhappy past, and of-course Midori, who gets my vote as one of the most memorable characters in this novel, Murakami spins a sensitive and absorbing yarn about the heart of a boy and its entanglements.
B001IHJ97E|3.0|Fairly entertaining film, but I probably won't watch it again for a long time. Good picture and sound.
B001H5X7I4|1.0|Greatest movie ever!!  Worst movie ever!!    These responses reflect the cultural and artistic divide we have in the US.(So do the Grammys!) As an \\"old fart\\"who loves action movies, I have to say that I made a big mistake in purchasing this incomprehensible piece of trash(Makes Steven Seagal films look like David Lean classics!). That aside, I am a fan of Downey, Nolte etc: and can't see why they would even consent to do this tripe.  Gross. Offensive. Vulgar. Meaningless.    Who gave the \\"green light\\" on this project? My God, money must flow like...(you fill in the blank) in La-La Land!  Where can I recycle this DVD?  (Now... where is my copy of Bridge on the River Kwai?)  PS Yes- I KNOW it's suppose to be a parody! But of what???
0061537969|5.0|The narrator is an old dog telling the story of his life in a one-family home.  He is memorable and lovable; from a crotchety old man back to his innocent youth. The first and second to last chapters are very sad. But it is also laugh out loud funny at times, and filled with love, devotion, philosophy, and hopefulness. Anyone having to make the decision when the times comes to let go at the end of your pet's life may find comfort reading this beautiful book.
B00003CXB4|3.0|The product was fine. The delivery time I thought was too long. I ordered on 2/2/2010 did not receive till 2/19/2010. I have ordered other products from other sellers in USA and it hasnt't taken as long.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|This is a must-buy DVD! In addition to capturing the essence of this great artist and humanitarian, the film is a great live concert that is very well produced and full of lots of different camera angles and fast-paced.  The special features add great and provocative details that weren't on the big screen, either, so it really adds to the texture of the film. I came away with a much deeper appreciation of Michael Jackson after watching this film.
0307346617|5.0|In the growing sub-genre of zombie fiction, Brooks work stands out. It is the best of the lot. It is gritty and real and smacks with the authenticity of the words of people who have been to hell and back.<br /><br />If you read only one \\"zombie book\\", you could do much worse than pick this one.
B0025KVLRO|5.0|Perfect cd for Beatles enthusiasts. I had all of the Beatles albums growing up as a kid but the way they were put out in the US versus the UK labels, certain songs like \\"Misery\\" and \\"Theres A Place\\" were left out. So I really appreciate a second chance to buy some of their early stuff as it was intended to come out.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I am neither a male, a nerd, a game player, or a comic book collector and I think this is the best comedy on TV right now.  I am a science teacher, so I appreciate the science commentary, but the character interaction is what I enjoy most.  How can anyone not find Sheldon's social awkwardness, extreme OCD, and deadpan delivery of his lines hilarious?  Howard's relationship with his mother and Raj, his choice of clothing, and his way of hitting on women are definitely funny.  Raj's remarkable change from shy geek to charm personified when inebriated is sheer genius, and Leonard's attempts to balance a relationship between his friends and neighbor Penny is the defining thread.  This show has some interesting situational comedy as well as some fantastic one-liners.  As the show proceeds, and the audience finds out more about the familial backgrounds, the characters become even more remarkable.  This show is unique, and as I've commented to my husband on several occasions, does require a certain level of intelligence to appreciate.  Simply put, it's new, different and refreshing, but may not appeal to someone who doesn't pay close attention to the dialogue.  The show has only gotten better in seasons 2 and 3 so I'd advise anyone to stick with it and give it a chance!
B002YICN74|5.0|I liked all of the songs. It is a cd I would listen to when I am having a rough day and the vibe from all the songs is kind of I guess you would say Mellow. My favorite song is Who I Am it showcases that everyone is special in there own way and that you should love people for who they really are instead of what you would like for them to be. When I listened to the cd for the first time I instantly feel in love with it because it is something that everyone can relate to in most of the songs at first I was not so sure that it would be a good cd but in the end I understood what the songs really meant to me. I think that everyone will have a different views about it in the end though maybe everyone will understand what is like to be different and learning to deal with it all and not really caring what everyone else thinks about you. Listen to the cd and see if you feel the same way or not.
0670021652|5.0|This non-fiction book by Elizabeth Gilbert was very well written.  I felt that I was truly involved in her adventures along with those of Felipe, her new husband to-be.  Elizabeth certainly was just as amazingly clear in this book as she was in the first, EAT,LOVE AND PRAY. Her research on marriage in various cultures, thoughts, insights, loves, joys, pain, compassion and persistance were all in evidence.  What a wonderful read!!
B0019HQIFE|4.0|I'll start my review off with saying I was never the biggest fan of John Mayer.  After watching this concert and all the commentary between sets I've even less of a fan now.  He is however a very talented musician and I was surprised to find how much I enjoyed the Trio (Blues and Jazz) section of this concert.<br /><br />I bought this BluRay because of the positive reviews I read on Audio/Videophile sites.  The reviews were spot on.  Audio was always crystal clear and well mixed; which provides only enough crowd noise to remind you this is a live recording.  The use of the surround tracks was perfect with the majority of show coming through the main stereo channels and a nice mix of center and surrounds to add enough reverb to recreate the sound of the venue.<br /><br />Video was again crystal clear and was nearly perfect.  Video quality is so great in 1080p you can actually read John Mayer's teleprompter in front of him.  Low levels (blacks) were always crisp even where contrasted with a spot light shining directly into camera lens.  Color was typically deep, but honestly a little boring and I found lacked the pop I expect with BluRay.  The acoustic set seemed washed out, but it maybe just the result of the harsh spot lights and gray colors worn by John.  The second set again was dull, but seemed to fit the mood of dimly lit Jazz bar.  The last set was certainly more colorful but lacked brilliance I've seen with other outstanding BluRay releases [[ASIN:B000T4SWXO Dave Matthews & Tim Reynolds: Live at Radio City Music Hall [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />Overall this is a good BluRay release, but between watching John sing from his Teleprompter all night (his eyes are focused there at least 50% of the show) and his commentary in between songs I'd probably pass if given the choice to buy this again.  If you like Mayer's music this would certainly be a decent way to enjoy your HiDef setup.
B000QUT9RY|5.0|I bought these speakers to replace a set of Altec Lansing computer speakers I'd had for several years - when the Altecs stopped working, I wanted to try speakers with a digital optical input (TOSLINK). These came to the top of the list because of the input, the reasonable price, and the positive reviews. I am surprised by how good they sound (and a little surprised by their size and solidity). Before, I used my Tivoli Model Two with an iPod dock for music while I was working on the computer - but these Behringers sound a lot better than the Model Two.    If space is not an issue and you want to spend about $100 on a pair of computer speakers, these are a great choice.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|After the initial setup of the Forerunner 405CX and linking which I admit took some time (10-15 minutes with the ANT agent software) with my MacBook Air (Leopard I think the latest 10.6.2 OS) I have been pleased with the performance of the product.  The ease of use on setting up the watch, which has nothing to do with your PC isn't intuitive.  For example, setting up your pace and other settings took a little bit of playing around with the watch. Also, as stated the bezel is a bit sensitive as you are making these settings.  I've not had any uploading or downloading issues on the Mac with the watch and I've had the product for about 3 months.    One thing I'm truly impressed with is after linking the data to the website being able to see map and satellite views of your runs.  As someone else stated the GPS functions as well as the mapping  makes it easy to run when you are traveling.  I did decide to buy the foot pod which greatly aids you in starting your runs without necessarily having to stabilize GPS signals.    I guess a few issues from a \\"husky\\" person's point of view is the Heart Rate monitor isn't as loose as stated by some...  I guess this is more of a ergonomic best fit trade-off.  I guess us big guys need to run more to be able to complain about the looseness of the strap (LOL!)  Also, doesn't quite make sense to not include the foot pod with the watch given you may want to do some training indoors and outdoors.  The foot pod seems to be more beneficial than the heart monitor as a add-on because you can take your heart rate the old fashioned way with your fingers...    The bezel is fairly sensitive but it's manageable...  Just to note, I don't use this usually as my primary watch because the watch is a bit bigger than my others and I don't find the strap as comfortable.  I haven't tried to change out the included velcro strap because for a 1-2 hour run for me it isn't necessary.    As far as the website I haven't had many problems reviewing my data directly or on the calendar.  I would also say it also isn't as intuitive as I would like but you can navigate to what you want without spending an inordinate amount of time to do it.  Please note I'm a longtime fully Mac person and I would say the the website could be optimized for better ease of use.    The GPS function as already stated takes a little time to find the satellites (about 20-30 seconds) and if you can afford it I would buy the foot pod as stated..    Overall, you can monitor progress; log your distance; see where you've gone; measure heart rate; have a virtual partner run with you; set your pace; and believe it or not tell time.  It's really a good tool to have once you get past the price.
006621131X|4.0|I'm not like my other friends.<br /><br />They are voracious readers, mostly of novels. I've always had a tough time getting into most novels, most likely because I choose poorly when it comes to them. Just ask my friends - I don't see them letting me pick a book any time soon for our off-again/off-again (no, not a typo) book club.<br /><br />I blame Terry Gross for making even bad books and authors sound interesting. I can't even tell you how many books I've bought from listening to Fresh Air - and so far I have yet to be remotely thrilled with any of them. My friends rightfully slammed me for my choice. I don't think we've had a joint book read since. It was that bad.<br /><br />Because of my bad choices - and this has been a life-long pattern, by the way - anymore I normally stick to history, memoirs, biographies and auto-biographies. You can't go wrong reading seven books about Patty Hearst, Mount Everest or the Vietnam War, can you?<br /><br />So I just finished reading Patti Smith's book - 'Just Kids'.<br /><br />Not an auto-biography, not quite a memoir. It centers as a telling of her relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe. She strays a little off the direct relationship here and there, but she always brings it around quite nicely. For the first two-thirds, Smith rarely talks about herself where it does not involve Mapplethorpe.<br /><br />But what I'm loving is her writing style. I have always loved her as a songwriter/artist, but those are snippets into how well she can put pen to paper - and you just know that is how she wrote it.<br /><br />I'd say, \\"oh to live from 1968-1973.....\\", but I was alive. I just was not living at the Chelsea Hotel in New York City. I am totally envious of Smith and Mapplethorpe.<br /><br />Perhaps it is just her prose, but to be in that hotel - and running into Grace Slick, Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin in the hotel bar, all at the same time? It can't just be her telling of it, it had to be incredible.<br /><br />Or to have William S. Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg staying in the same hotel and become your friends???? Or Sam Shepard to be your lover?  I'd say \\"surreal\\", but that would be reserved for running into Salvador Dali in the lobby while you're holding a stuffed raven and have him comment on it.<br /><br />That doesn't even cover her friendships with Todd Rundgren (really?), Jim Carroll or a relationship with a member of Blue Oyster Cult (really, really???). This was all before she ever became famous in her own right.<br /><br />You'd think it was some really great acid trip, but it's not. At times it almost borders on namedropping, but she never quite goes over that line.<br /><br />I suppose this book can be as much about her unorthodox relationship with Mapplethorpe as it is with Smith's fascination with 19th century poet, Arthur Rimbaud.  You do not go too many pages where Rimbaud is not referenced somewhere.<br /><br />Now, I like Patti Smith as an artist and always have, but I think anyone would find this book fascinating.your friends????

This was a great disappointment to me - I was so looking forward to hearing these songs in sonic splendour.    My first comments were made listening through the EMM CDSD transport so I thought I would give the White Album another listen through the Marantz SA-7S1 which is superlative as a transport and the EMM's superior in every way except price with EMM being more than double. Relevant to this context, the Marantz is warmer, more natural but at the same time more revealing. The album generally sounds compressed with brittle vocals on some tracks etc. Same conclusion.

B002EWD08Q|3.0|And I like Queens of the Stone Age, so that's good for me. Except it's a wee bit fuzzier, and more varying drums, which must have been a signal of the monkeys rebelling back on the east coast in production. But it's not really a Monkeys sound. It doesn't pump me up, I don't go gaga over their down-home Sheffield-boy touch and I am no longer charmed by their adolescent erratic energy.     I will probably no longer listen to them while driving to get friends to do stupid teen things with. With this album, I will listen to them when writing long English essays or while ruminating and attempting to intellectualize a Bergman film. It doesn't feel like rebellion, see, it feels like understanding and reluctantly getting along with pretty significant efficiency but tinged melancholy. Everyone's right, they grew up.     And what the hell is up with the Amazon album bio thing? The only reason I'm even writing a review is to complain about that.     And the chorus of that Secret door song sounds very similar to something else I've heard. Something brit-popish, and I will find it and get back to you all on that.
B002ZIAC26|5.0|Even I, a big supporter of indie labels like Sub Pop (they spawned Nirvana), had never heard of Beach House. But when I heard this album, I was blown away. Literally. I was thrown off my feet, I just loved this album. It's just great. Great for everybody. Anybody. Just a great album. I love the singer's voice. This is real talent here. This talent in the band isn't gonna stop talentless puppets-to-record-companies like the Jonas Brothers, but Beach House stands the test of time.    Best songs on the album are \\"Zebra,\\" \\"Lover of Mine\\" and \\"10 Mile Stereo.\\"    Cool album.

0670069027|5.0|Stieg Larsson's second helping of Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist's harrowing Swedish adventures is just as amazing as the first book.  This book defintely focuses more on Salander and her amazingly unsettling past.  Mysteries abound and we meet new characters and locations.  The ending is left more open than the first book in the series and continues almost directly into the third (which I can't wait for).  The villains, and there are many, are despicable and the connections to the past are creepy.  The book is tech heavy at times but you never feel lost in it.  Overall, another fantastic book from Larsson.

0812973992|5.0|This is a novel that takes in the whole world within the span of a single day in New York City that, like any day in any city, town, or hamlet, is filled with the ordinary and, sometimes, the extraordinary. McCann tells us the title of is book is lifted from Tennyson's &#34;Locksley Hall&#34; - &#34;Not in vain the distance beacons. Forward, forward let us range,/Let the great world spin for ever down the ringing grooves of change&#34; - in a couplet that points to the the novelist's universal ambitions. Leave it to an Irish storyteller to write so compelling an entry in the Great American Novel sweepstakes...it's pretty much here, and it's not - McCann's characters aren't straight out of central casting, the whores don't have hearts of gold, he seems uninterested in predatory oligarchs. But he is indeed very interested in human predation, in the manner of Lu Xun, for whom &#34;people eat people,&#34; or &#34;men eat men,&#34; is a distillation of human history. Despite this realization, the converse - redemption and &#34;valuing people&#34; - nevertheless happen.<br /><br />The novel as grand verismo concoction: diverse New Yorkers, living their lives on a sweltering day in August 1974, when an aptly named wire-walker ambles across a 200-pound cable stretched between the twin towers of the World Trade Center. McCann has sacramentalized these ordinary lives that, like most lives, are fraught with circumstance and drama and are thus anything but ordinary. He lifts these stories up in a very secular way, despite the centrality of an extraordinary Irishman - an against-type &#34;whiskey priest&#34; whose humanity nearly overwhelms the book - interweaving the &#34;ordinary&#34; with the day's extraordinary event, raising the mundane to the nearly magical, the routine to the unique, and all against the towering backdrop of New York City. The author does so in palpable recognition that our cities are our universal places, our repositories of culture, history, mythology, dreams...the places where our great narratives are redacted and woven into the national tapestry, the meaning of which we argue endlessly.<br /><br />The book continues to sink in, long after it's closed, working like a time-release capsule, and I've already returned to it to reread passages of particular power or insight. It will almost certainly strike some readers as a narrative mess; it's told mostly in first-person, from numerous points of view, and is very close to a novel in stories. In turns, it's magical, brutal, closely observant, coolly distant, tremendously funny, and to my eyes a startling piece of writing by a young master who slides in and out of diverse characters and dialects as though he's lived his entire life in the native habitats of each...a power British novelist David Mitchell and very few others possess.<br /><br />I'll conclude where McCann begins, with a quotation from Alexandar Hemon's wonderful The Lazarus Project, which McCann deploys as a promise to the reader: &#34;All the lives we could live, all the people we will never know, never will be, they are everywhere. That is what the world is.&#34; It's a promise that, to me at least, Let the Great World Spin fulfills.e places where our great narratives are redacted and woven into the national tapestry, the meaning of which we argue endlessly.

B002ZXNZQG|4.0|Ignatius J. Reilly, Toole's main character in this hilarious tour de force, stands alone atop the heap of modern anti-heroes. After reading Confederacy, one never encounters the wackiness of life without asking, \\"What would Ignatius do?\\" This book, testimony to Toole's brave genius, takes aim at the twin inanities of multiculturalism and political correctness, years before they fouled our national consciousness. Don't get me wrong. Toole is absolutely fair and even-handed: everybody gets theirs in this fearless and funny book. The plot is tight. The action is fast-paced. The characters are memorable. The ending is madly happy. And along the way, every page is crammed with humor, insight and deeply appreciative humanity. Long live JK Toole! Long live Ignatius!
B001NXDIMK|5.0|If you watched Season One, then Two must be watched.  One cannot completely understand One, without watching Two.  I've watched several of these episodes two and threes times, just to make sure I didn't miss anything.  That is the thing about Damages, because of the moving forward and backward through time, it's easy to miss an important item, causing one to not be able to connect the dots.  However, that is the benefit of picking up the DVDs.      Season Two is much better than Season One, however, one cannot be understood without the other.  The only thing that is difficult is that it seems like the writers tried to squish more of the story into Season Two, and this is evident at the end of the season's episodes, where much takes place during the last few episodes, in what appears to be a larger span of time.      And then there is the ending!  Very much filled with suspense, and after the first viewing, one will say, What just happened and want to watch it over and over.  You'll be left wondering who just won here.  And never forget the theme of Damages, Trust No One!
B00337KM2S|5.0|UP IN THE AIR is one of those small, quiet films that builds up impact, and then hits you over the heart with everything it's got.  The film follows Ryan Bingham (no relation to the country singer/composer of CRAZY HEART, by the way) as he flies across the nation firing people.  Ryan doesn't care much for love and marriage (despite his kid sister's upcoming wedding), but he falls hard for Alex, another frequent-flier.  The biggest thing in Ryan's life is his job; but that's all about to change.<br /><br />Okay, the plot for UP IN THE AIR sounds rather tedious.  And, in lesser hands, it would be.  The film isn't a romantic comedy; nor is it a serious contemplation on the redemptive/destructive power of love.  It's a commentary on the current economic status (most of the people getting fired in this film are non-actors reliving the moment they lost their job); and yet it never takes itself too seriously.  It features stellar chemistry from the two leads (George Clooney and Vera Farmiga, both deserving their Oscar nods and more), as well as strong support from Anna Kendrick (also deserving that Oscar nod), Jason Bateman, and cameos from J.K. Simmons, Sam Eliot, Danny McBride, Zack Galifianakis.  The directing (courtesy of Jason Reitman, surpassing his previous films JUNO and even THANK YOU FOR SMOKING) is top-notch, and the script is stellar; if the film has any flaw, it's that it comes off as a bit over-polished.  And yet, with such a likable and enigmatic cast (boldly led by Clooney at his finest), this film also feels organic and natural.  UP IN THE AIR is proof that serious filmmaking still exists in Hollywood.
B0015DROBO|5.0|As said before the synopsis has been reviewed on enough here, I will just write about my personal impressions.  As well as a couple of counter arguments that were mentioned the in negative critical reviews.<br /><br />Our girl with the dragon tattoo is anything but a one dimensional character.  She is very complex with her own demons driving her.  She has as extreme anti-social personality disorder with tendencies bordering on psychopathy.  But with some very important personal traits that exclude her from being a true sociopath.  She does have empathy towards others like her that have been abused or misused as well as a driven need for vengeance towards those that have forsaken the trust that may have been invested in them.  But she does have a learned (as opposed to a inherently ingrained) sense of what is right and wrong.  She is NOT a peripheral character.  The novel goes back and forth between her perspective and that of an investagative reporter that she finally hooks up with about half way into the book.  Even thought the book spends more time with him in that first half, it is her portions, though, that really grab your attention.  When I finished the book, I had a hard time starting my next one as I kept thinking back to \\"The Girl\\" and hoping the best for her. I will be reading the other two books in this series.<br /><br />As far as being a slow read, maybe a little in the beginning, but this is not some mindless Dan Brownesque page turner though.  It is a well thought out story with some really involving characterizations, you will know these people and have a good chance (if you are paying attention) to come up with some good ideas as to the solution.  There is also a totally essential genealogy chart at the beginning of the book to help you keep track of the players.  You will be referring to it often so you might as well bookmark it.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book beyond just a temporarily entertainment.  I will be thinking about it for some time.<br /><br />===<br />Don Freeman<br />[...]

B002MRROKS|5.0|watching this DVD is simply amazing. I know that I'll never get to see a real Nirvana show, but I think that this is truly the closest I can come to being at one. The concert is shot very intimately (even though it was at a large festival) making it seem more like a smaller club show. The performance was top-notch and purely entertaining, with so many performances of great songs. It also shows a little bit of a sense of humor held by the band, both in a couple jokes told over the course of the show, and a random guy dancing on stage for half of the songs. Nirvana is a huge influence to me and actually seeing them perform is a wonderful experience. So I recommend this DVD to anyone who is willing to turn down the lights, blast the volume, and get truly into one of the greatest performers of all time.

B000OPO6VU|5.0|English prog rock giants Emerson Lake and Palmer released its fourth album in two years entitled Trilogy in August of 1972.<br />That year was arguably progressive rock's peak with Yes releasing Fragile and Close to the Edge. Genesis released their first UK Top 20 charting album Foxtrot. Jethro Tull released its first #1 album Thick As a Brick. The Moody Blues issued their chart topping Seventh Sojourn. Also Pink Floyd released its first US Top 50 album Obscured by Clouds and were performing and recording their classic Dark Side of the Moon which would come out in 1973.<br />However, 1972 belonged to Emerson Lake and Palmer (or ELP for short to describe keyboard playing maestro Keith Emerson, singer/bass player/guitarist Greg Lake and drummer Carl Palmer) as they earlier that year released Pictures At an Exhibition (a live recording of their classic adaptation of Mussorgsky's classical masterpiece) and at the same pace recorded the followup to 1971's classic Tarkus (which was the only #1 album for ELP in their homeland and first US Top 10 album) with Lake once again in the producer's seat with Yes co-producer Eddy Offord engineering. Would this album continue ELP's winning streak or start of a bad rut (read on and find out as I did in November of 1996 when I first acquired the Rhino CD issue).<br />The album opens with the lengthy epic \\"The Endless Enigma\\" with a full-blown \\"Fugue\\" sandwiched in the middle written by Emerson and Lake. Next was ELP's biggest US single which was the acoustic ballad \\"From the Beginning\\" (penned by Lake) which has Greg on acoustic guitar and playing a nice tasty guitar solo and people overlook his great guitar playing skills. Continuing the band's counterpointing to being serious with the hilarious 'The Sheriff\\" (penned by Emerson and Lake). This includes stellar drumming by Carl and great Hammond organ and double tracked piano work by Keith about a cowboy who has difficulties catching bad guys like Big bad Josie. The first side ends with a stellar rocking rendition of Aaron Copland's classical piece \\"Hoedown\\" which is at a faster speed as opposed to Copland's original. It includes Hammond organ work and trumpet-like fanfares on synthesizers by Keith, stellar bass guitar work from Greg and great drumming by Carl.<br />The second side begins with the epic title cut (penned by Emerson and Lake). Starts out as a piano and voice thing from Keith and Greg then it switches gears and goes into a superb epic. Then we have a short but punchy rocker called \\"Living Sin\\" which has Lake singing part of the song in a deep voice and sounds as heavy as things like Black Sabbath were doing at the time (this track was penned by all three ELP members). We close with the epic keyboard heavy closing instrumental \\"Abbadon's Bolero\\" penned by Emerson.<br />Trilogy would prove to be another winner from ELP and it would give the band its first US Top 5 album reaching #5 in the fall of 1972 and another million seller.<br />There are two remasters out one that Shout Factory released which to me sounds like a victim of the loudness war whilst the UK Sanctuary is sonically superior and not overly compressed and also has a bonus live version of \\"Hoedown\\".<br />This album is recommended!r rocking rendition of Aaron Copland's classical piece \\"Hoedown\\" which is at a faster speed as opposed to Copland's original.

It's truly unfortunate that these guys never had any kind of presence here in the USA.    For that reason, they didn't play even 1 date on their 2009/10 tour in the USA or Canada.  Whatta shame.    It's too late in their careers now, but I believe many of the songs could be hits today and in fact revive the flagging music industry.      I might even buy a 2nd copy just in case something happens to my original.  If you want more of the Shads alone, I highly recommend the Final Tour DVD/CD combo.  I wonder why Eagle didn't release a double CD of this DVD?  It would certainly be worth having.    Don't waste another second.  Order your copy of this DVD NOW...before Amazon runs out...again.

While the story may be unoriginal (which I don't care one bit because I love every variation of this theme) Elkeles does a really god job in creating characters that are real and this story is very refreshing. I found myself never wanting to put Perfect Chemistry down but not wanting to read it so fast, I ended up reading it in 18 hours no stop, that's how good it is.<br /><br />All my favourite elements are in here: witty dialogues and bickering bewteen Alex and Brit, sexual tension, humor, drama and the story is told from both prospective (which always intrugues me).<br /><br />The only thing that bothers me is the ugly rap video that Elkeles put on her website, those actors are really ugly, all over the book I took inspiration from the book cover to visualise Alex and Brit.
B0000508U6|5.0|Upon its release, \\"Parachutes\\" reached #1 in the UK and peaked at #51 on the Billboard 200. It has since gone mutli-platinum in both countries.    Coldplay's debut album is their rawest recording, and by raw I imply that it is not over-produced. It has a naturally warm and spacious sound, which is mostly due to Chris Martin's vulnerable, yet inviting voice conveying honest lyrics, and Jonny Buckland's aching reverb-style guitar that also makes good use of the slide bar. However, every band member shines on this record.     \\"Parachutes\\" starts with the optimistic, understated `Don't Panic', which is a great opener. `Shiver' is a rock/pop song with a stand-out guitar riff. A slide bar guitar note brings in the haunting `Spies', a song with a paranoid vibe that slowly builds to an almost frantic climax before it slowly burns out. `Sparks' is a swaying love song with a cool vibe and an excellent bass line. A powerful and driving ode to colorful love, `Yellow' is the \\"rocker\\" of the album, with its pounding drums and wailing guitar riff. `Trouble' opens with a sad and blue piano that carries into a laid back drum and bass line, definitely one of Coldplay's finest songs. The title track is a 46-second treat from Chris Martin and his acoustic guitar. I love the sound of his fingers sliding on the strings as he changes chords, it sounds very intimate. Following the low-key tune is `High Speed', the most produced song on \\"Parachutes\\", because this song was carried over from their \\"Blue Room\\" EP with a different producer. However, it fits perfectly and is an amazing song. Jonny Buckland's riff on `High Speed' is so beautiful and will implant itself in your brain for a long time. `We Never Change' is a soul-searching surprise. As the final track, `Everything's Not Lost' ends the album as optimistic as it began, and sounds hopeful.    In the end, \\"Parachutes\\" leaves you feeling musically fulfilled, yet personally empty because it leaves you wanting more of its distinctive moodand vibe. Oh...what a way to go down!    5 stars!

0439023491|5.0|Review in 75 Words or Less: Intense, nail bitting, thought provoking, the list could go on and on. Catching Fire begins shortly after The Hunger Games. Katniss has found herself basically between a rock and a hard place... both politically and romantically. Collins begins the novel slowly, luring the reader in until they are so captivated that there is no escape until the last page. I can only now count down the days till Mockingjay. It is going to be epic!<br /><br />Final Verdict: Catching Fire lived up to all my expectations and more. This series has quickly become one of my favorites of all time. Everything about this novel and its series is captivating. I can't wait to learn more about this world and its characters.
0691142165|2.0|Glossed over history of financial crisis with large emphasis on number recitation, some of which are repeated 3,4 times. Some important insights are the same ones from previous books, now being supported by more numbers. But NUMBERS DON'T TELL YOU THE FULL STORY OF WHAT HAPPENED AND WHY, which is the biggest part of what is missing from the book.    Contents organized by types of crisis, so different aspects of the same crisis got analyzed separately (usually concisely instead of more in-depth), making it hard to understand their interaction. From reading I don't get a feeling that the authors are deep enough in financial history to reveal more causal relationships.    Wording is aimed more at demonstration of sophistication than making knowledge understandable. Long sentences and repeated self-exaltation make it hard for the reader to keep focused.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|I always wanted to watch this movie since the first time I saw the trailer for this movie. One thing that seem to hide in the trailer was that it was a musical.

It a business way of course.

0439023483|5.0|Review in 75 words or less: At the end of this novel, I had to ask myself \\"Why had I not read this sooner?\\" Short answer: I believed that it could not live up to the hype. However, it did. The novel is filled with excitement, action, emotions, and so much more. I honestly believe that there is a little something for everyone in this novel. This novel is dystopian at its best, and is a definite must read.<br /><br />Final Verdict: I was very pleased with this novel. It is definitely the best dystopian that I have had the pleasure to read in a very long time. If you have not read this novel yet, be sure to add it to your TBR pile. It is that good.

B002VKE1K2|5.0|I had heard many people's opinions of this movie before renting it myself.  Most were negative while the rest believed that it was the scariest movie ever made.  My preconceptions prepared me to reject it out of hand.  While I was not a fan of the \\"Blair Witch Effect\\" at all, I thought that it added to this delightful shoestring budgeted yarn.  The hand-held recording technique gave it a realism that would have been absent in a professional production, instead of being just annoying and nauseating as it was in The Blair Witch Project.  The actors did such a good job that it seemed they either had to be ad-libbing their lines or weren't acting at all, giving it even more of a realistic touch.  It actually seemed as if they were two normal people filming these events as they happened, and that is very hard to get right.  Try reciting lines while brushing your teeth and you will see what I mean.  Talking to your spouse while doing the same is a different matter entirely, if a bit uncouth, but people do it every day.  Now as to the subject matter.  This is exactly how I would expect such an event to play out. If a camera were present during something like this, you could expect this movie to be the result.  What really impressed me was the escalation of events.  They went from trivial through most of the film to deadly serious in a heart beat without pausing for apology. Paranormal occurrences do not hold to Hollywood scripted timelines.  I expected a picture that was hokey and Blair Witchy, but instead got something real that I found terrifying and effective in the extreme.  The common-place setting helps set the tone and the filmmaker invites the viewer in through familiarity, allowing the imagination to run rampant.  Have you never been woken by a strange noise and wondered what it was while your heart beat a little faster?  It is human nature to fear that which goes bump in the night.  As soon as we can positively label and categorize those same bumps, they lose their power over us.  By its very nature, gratuitous CGI applies an automatic label for our collective psyche to get a handle on, thereby rendering it less frightening.  As scary looking as it may be, at least we know what we are dealing with.  Splatter and gore in cinema teaches us what we already know - to fear the knife - but it doesn't lend us fear in and of itself.  This movie does, to my own surprise and delight.

B0028ER4PK|4.0|I had to return the first album because \\"love her madly\\" was skipping. Amazon sent another one out next day mail, and that one could have been packed better. The box was to small so the cover got bent a little. so I kept the first cover and returned the sum of the 2 bad ones. Amazon had been getting better at shipping records, and the first was not their fault. From what I read RTI (the co. who presses the record) had problems w/ the first runs which was quit a while ago and maybe I received an old pressing    As for the record this is the first doors remaster I have heard and it's awesome! Well done by Bernie Grundman Studios.
B001OQCV2E|2.0|Yes, 2012 has some great explosions. Stuff does blow up real good. Big explosions!   The plot? Well, it is about the sun heating the Earth with nutrinos causing massive earthquakes, or something, and the government's efforts to survive the disaster.       Not enough plot for you? Well, add in John Cusack as a washed up writer/limo driver, who finds out about the government's plans and wades through the devestation with his ex-wife and daughter to a possible safe area on a special map.      I was supposed to believe that the world's governments would cooperate like they did in this movie. There was alot of unbelievable stuff in this movie, but that can be overlooked if there was more to this movie than just some big explosions.

B002ONC9NC|4.0|Set in the 1960s, An Education focuses on Jenny Mellor. Sixteen year old Jenny lives with her parents just outside of London and has dreams of going to Oxford. it's hard to say if the dream is hers or her father's, but regardless, she works hard to get good grades and do well on her exams so the dream can become reality. She leads a very stable, suburban life: goes to school, plays cello, has a small but solid group of girlfriends and gets along well enough with her parents. She's also very pretty.<br /><br />I think that is one aspect of the movie that is, perhaps, the most important. In the 1960s women did not yet have open access in to many careers. So much hinged on their looks. Unattractive and you could count on a life of working as a teacher and living alone. Attractive and you strived (and I think that is the right word) to find yourself a man to take care of you, thereby relinquishing you of any duties to work outside of the home (and, if you were very lucky, maybe not even inside the home). But if you found that balance of pretty and smart, then you had a few more options available to you. You could make decisions in your destiny. Rotten decisions by today's standards, but decisions nonetheless.<br /><br />Jenny fell into this last group of girls.<br /><br />One day Jenny meets David Goldman, a man over twice her age. David goes out of his way to show Jenny and her family that his interest in her is not improper and that he wants solely to expose her to cultural activities which she enjoys. (As a viewer, you quickly know that he is slick, and his interest is quite improper.) And as the plot develops, Jenny has decisions to make that are slightly outside of the slim pickings normally presented to girls of her ilk.<br /><br />I enjoyed An Education quite a bit. I think it would be ridiculous if it won Best Picture because it was simply not good enough to warrant that amount of praise. There was no backstory to the movie, no build up to the plot. The ending was a little forced. But the way the movie was filmed was beautiful and I don't know how you could stare at Jenny on the screen and not fall in love with her.<br /><br />It's definitely a film worth checking out.the movie was filmed was beautiful and I don't know how you could stare at Jenny on the screen and not fall in love with her.

B002TYZKIM|5.0|It was a tragic & somber story when Michael Jackson (MJ) died on 25th June 2009 while preparing for 50 \\"This Is It\\" O2 Arena, London live shows. The movie gives one a glimpse of the hard work behind the glorious shows that one sometimes take for granted. What the movie reveals is a magnificent MJ at his best (in full control & as nimble as ever despite being 51 years old) & his ernomous drive to deliver a performance of a lifetime! Sadly this was not to be, but this movie shows beyond any shadow of doubt how great MJ was as a live performer and dancer! A great must be DVD collection for all music lovers, young & old. A well made movie with unbelievable rehearsal performances by Michael Jackson!
B001MYIXAW|5.0|I like horror.  Good horror.  Horror stories and films that make you care about the characters.  Original stories, also, stories with a unique approach.  Stories with a lot of atmosphere.  Stories and films which create tension and dread with subtle means, stories which target the subconscious of the reader/viewer.  At least three of these qualities should be present, the first one being essential.  LET THE RIGHT ONE IN has many of these qualities.  I saw this movie a couple of months ago in the theater (a terrible copy) and couldn't wait to see it again, for I knew there was much in that film still to be discovered.  I bought it on Blu Ray and watched it again, and wasn't disappointed.  For many reasons.  It's a strange film which can be regarded both as a youth film and a horror movie.  It's a film that doesn't rely on cheap gore and (by now predictable) shock effects.  It uses CGI sparingly, only when necessary.  The photography/composition is singular (European?).  The locations, season (cold winter), interiors create an atmosphere of alienation, of mental desolation.  The music is a unique blend of suspense and melancholy.  And then there are the characters.  Young teenagers, timid, uncertain, desperate for some love and sympathy in a cold (war) world.  The acting by the two main characters is remarkable, modest yet convincing (not to forget the eyes and voice of Eli (Lina Leandersson), this alone is worth seeing this horror film - and on Blu Ray it's even more mesmerizing).  The pace is slow, yet the film never bores, for the characters get you under a spell.  Scandinavian films have a great tradition in psychological study and youth cinema, which shows in LET THE RIGHT ONE IN.  So, I wonder, why does this film need an American remake?  Big bucks, of course.  I'm not going to see it.  Something which is splendid doesn't need a remake.  I simply don't want to spoil the magic.
1416550550|5.0|I thought the novel was fantastic. I wasn't too sure when I picked  it up but once I started to read I couldn't be away from it for long. I was not confused by the period changes. It seemed to flow right along with the story giving out little clues as you went along. As a child I loved reading fairy tales and the additional little stories were an added bonus. As a child you read the fairy story for the tale but as an adult you see the underlying meanings. It was one of those books I hoped would never come to an end but when it did I really loved how it ended.
0061719544|5.0|So many failures he experienced along the way, but glory he did achieve.  Craig Ferguson tells all and spares no details in his memoir.  Granted, he admits some of the details may be altered or untrue, but when you're a black-out alcoholic for 20-ish years, what do you expect? You write what you remember, whether it really happened that way or not...    This book makes you laugh and breaks your heart, sometimes in the same chapter.  You get a rare look into the soul of a man who's lived hard, repented, and got a shot at redemption, which he did not take for granted.  It's inspiring, it's depressing, it's one of the most honest books I've ever read.  I hope you continue to write more books, Mr. Ferguson, because if they're as good as the first 2 you've written, I'll eat them up as soon as they're on the shelves.  Well done, sir, and i eagerly await your next publication.

B001OQCV2E|4.0|According to the Mayan calendar, the end of the world is supposed to occur on the Winter Solstice, 2012.  This prophecy comes true in this action-packed adventure movie.  At the beginning of the movie, a scientist discovers huge solar flares bursting forth from the sun.  Along with these flares, the earth's continents are shifting on their plates.  Soon, massive cracks are forming, which swallow entire buildings.  It seems as if the Mayan prediction is coming true.    John Cusack (Jackson Curtis) is a struggling novelist who has picked his children up for a camping trip from his estranged wife (Amanda Peet) and her plastic surgeon boyfriend.  They decide to camp at Yellowstone National Park.  Upon arriving, they decide to find the spot where Jackson and his wife used to go; a beautiful, secluded lake.  Once they reach the spot, they discover that the lake has literally evaporated.  Discovered by U.S. Army personnel, Jackson and his children are ordered off the premises.  Jackson, sensing something is completely wrong, rushes back to his wife's house.  He manages to pick up his wife and her boyfriend just before the town literally falls into the ocean.  Thus begins a global adventure for Jackson and his family as they try to out-run tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and massive tidal waves in an attempt to reach three secret \\"arks\\" built by the governments of the world as lifeboats for survivors.  Will they reach these \\"arks\\" in time?    I found \\"2012\\" to be an exciting movie to watch.  Danny Glover, Woody Harrelson, John Cusack, and Amanda Peet turn in good performances, and the special effects are exciting to see.  The tidal waves that covered the Himalayas is one of the film's high points.  Roland Emmerich, the film's director, has directed other good action movies, including \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" and \\"Independence Day\\".  \\"2012\\" follows in the steps of these great movies.    I recommend this movie very highly.  The special effects will leave viewers spellbound.  If you enjoy good adventure movies, then be sure to see \\"2012\\".
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I thought that, considering the food companies themselves were unwilling to be open to scrutiny in this documentary, and present more of their side of the picture, the film managed to be remarkably balanced and objective.  Naturally, it behooves us all to be somewhat aware of the \\"factory system\\" that is involved with the food that sustains us.  I guess what I find so remarkable is that the system works so well, not that it has failings, considering the level that the U.S. has become dependent on just a few large companies.  On the other hand, the tragedies were also included and put into perspective.  That the system is so large and inflexible that it cannot be corrected when humans or animals are being abused is discouraging.  In getting some feel for the enormity of the food industry, I guess the ultimate question that lurks at the boundaries of this film is whether or not we are getting close to (or perhaps have exceeded) what the ecologists like to call \\"carrying capacity\\" for population.

0786838655|4.0|I just finished reading Percy Jackson and the Olympians the Lighting Thief; truly I do think this book does a great job, and I can get why a lot of fans of Harry Potter.  It has a lot of similarities in it; for one three seemingly adolescent main adventures, another is the hero finding out he's different, the know-it-all, and the clumsy one.  I can see these but where as your average Harry Potter thinks \\"this guy is  ripping off Potter\\" I know that these archetypes are as old as time.  They've been here before JK Rowling and Rick Riordan even thought about writing. These series together are modern myth being retold for a new generation.  One dealt with the magical world of wizard, the other is a modern day retelling of some of the most ancient myths we have, and I for one am glad we have both of them.<br /> Rick Riordan really knows his stuff.  He uses the Greek myths, and the pantheon well, your protagonist is Percy Jackson a twelve year old sixth grader who suffers from dyslexia and ADHD.  Something many kids now or days can relate to, he has a friend named Grover who is disabled, and he has a teacher who is in a wheelchair.  Riordan actually uses these characters to their advantages in showing that no matter what you think you are you can do whatever you want, which is a message kids need to hear. He is masterful at blending the modern and mythical worlds together to make something new of the old. Getting back to the plot Percy life is changed when he is attacked by a teacher who is in fact one of the Furies of the underworld, he finds out quickly that what he thought was ADHD and Dyslexia are actually signs that you are a demigod or could be, he is soon transported to Camp Half Blood where he meets others like himself, Annabeth who is the Daughter of Athena goddess of wisdom, Luke the Son of Hermes the god of the messengers, travelers, and thieves, and Clarisse daughter of Ares God of War. This colorful cast of characters is thrust into a familiar situation for most kids, summer camp where you have to do activities you don't want to and some you want to.  He also finds out that the teacher and the friend he thought were disabled are actually a centaur and a satyr.  I find this turn of events to be both wise choices and hilarious consequences, if you are disabled you know that if you walk you may not truly walk but trot like a goat, if you're in a wheelchair many people do see the chair as part of your body rather than something that supports your body, therefore these are actually ingenuous analogies to what kids can and will see, and may lead to giving disabled kids more of a variety to actually read. What I find most refreshing is the fact that he doesn't stray from the myths that he's using he actually uses them and puts them in modern settings, the ferryman of the river styx is here, all three levels of the underworld are well represented.  Hades is a jealous god, one that is banished from Olympus like he should be.  Zeus is a jealous, egotistical god.  Poseidon is a rebellious god, these are true to the natures of the myths.<br /> The book is in a strong first person tone, which is hard to find.  I myself usually prefer third person and this book didn't have it, but the first person narrative works for it.  I think if he had gone with a third person it would of taken some of the joy out of the reading.  His ability to break the fourth wall having Percy actually write this as he discovers he is the son of the sea god is very intelligent and capturing of the imagination.  I cannot say that I found this book to be lacking in anyway, if you are a fan of Harry Potter you will like this, if you don't then you're thinking too much because Percy Jackson is not ripping off Harry Potter he is just adding to the pile of great books for kids to read, that won't let the past diet kids, summer camp where you have to do activities you don't want to and some you want to.  He also finds out that the teacher and the friend he thought were disabled are actually a centaur and a satyr.  I find this turn of events to be both wise choices and hilarious consequences, if you are disabled you know that if you walk you may not truly walk but trot like a goat, if you're in a wheelchair many people do see the chair as part of your body rather than something that supports your body, therefore these are actually ingenuous analogies to what kids can and will see, and may lead to giving disabled kids more of a variety to actually read. What I find most refreshing is the fact that he doesn't stray from the myths that he's using he actually uses them and puts them in modern settings, the ferryman of the river styx is here, all three levels of the underworld are well represented.  Hades is a jealous god, one that is banished from Olympus like he should be.  Zeus is a jealous, egotistical god.  Poseidon is a rebellious god, these are true to the natures of the myths.    The book is in a strong first person tone, which is hard to find.  I myself usually prefer third person and this book didn't have it, but the first person narrative works for it.  I think if he had gone with a third person it would of taken some of the joy out of the reading.  His ability to break the fourth wall having Percy actually write this as he discovers he is the son of the sea god is very intelligent and capturing of the imagination.  I cannot say that I found this book to be lacking in anyway, if you are a fan of Harry Potter you will like this, if you don't then you're thinking too much because Percy Jackson is not ripping off Harry Potter he is just adding to the pile of great books for kids to read, that won't let the past die

I do a lot of video encoding with my i7, and temps w/stock cooler were running 89-91 C. when all 4 (8, actually) cores were at 100%.  This went down to 58C after installation of the Hyper 212.  It did require removing the MB, but the whole thing took less than 1/2 hr. start to finish.  Well worth it, excellent price and quick ship from Amazon.

B00275EGWY|3.0|Hey don't fret, potential enlistee! Hard as it is to discount the evidence of your senses when bombarded with skillful and costly cinematography, the 'gritty realism' of this film is totally unrealistic, full-bore Hollywood. Yeah, there may be scenes of mayhem similar to the scenes in the film at times, but not with such convenient regularity, not even in Baghdad in 2004. And there were innumerable other implausible or outright false details; just look at the one-star reviews here and not how many are written by military veterans.<br /><br />So, is \\"the Hurt Locker\\" an anti-military film? Hmm. It didn't strike me that way. Is it an anti-war film? Well, it doesn't glorify war, that's obvious, but it doesn't precisely get tough and analytical about the futility of war either. We all know , whether first hand or not, that war is dangerous to living things, soldiers or kids or old ladies at market. The Hurt Locker DOES depict the absolute futility of America's military occupation of Iraq, but that analysis seems almost tangential to the core of the film, which is the portrayal of Sgt. James, the genuine \\"wild man\\" who defuses bombs with his bare hands and whose maverick heroism gets several of his comrades gravely wounded, probably unnecessarily. Are we supposed to admire the maverick, or at least to empathize with him? That has to be what the film is asking of us. But the man is an ACTOR, friends! He's good-looking, witty, and he gets soft-hearted about an Iraqi boy with a big smile. The real Sgt James (who wouldn't be allowed such maverick-space in the real army) would not be so appealing. He's a pathological dude, amigos! He's a runaway train you wouldn't want on your tracks. I'm not sure you'd want him coming home to your community, either, even with combat ribbons. The real Sgt Jameses, and there are a few, bring home more trouble than the whole army protected you from. The psych clinics and emergency rooms of America are familiar with Sgt James and his battered wife.<br /><br />Apparently lots of people were impressed with Jeremy Renner's performance as Sgt James. Me, I thought it was shallow. Anthony Mackie, as the second man on the bomb squad, delivered a more convincing characterization. Can a film this bloody and ugly be bland? It was for me. I sat through it without any emotional or intellectual engagement whatsoever.Apparently lots of people were impressed with Jeremy Renner's performance as Sgt James. Me, I thought it was shallow.

B002SQ3664|4.0|I cheerfully forgive this film whenever it is over the top or under the tent(?), because even though the perspective can be a little too close, as movies destined for TV often are, and even though Elliot's father looks more like Zorba the Greek than a Jewish alte-kaka (and his mother more a Polish babushka than a Jewish balabusta), (Hey, what are movies without stereotypes?), and even though I wish the movie were twice as long, the movie was the best replica of the era I have ever seen since I was at the original.  Ang Lee captures America shockingly well - Connecticut suburbia in Ice Storm, the Civil War in Ride with the Devil, and now the Brief Shining Moment that was known as Woodstock.

B001HN694K|2.0|Having read \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There\\" several times over the course of my life (and loving these stories), I was disappointed in Disney's newest cinematic version.  Lewis Carroll's adventures of a little girl who falls down a rabbit hole to discover a strange world is \\"mad\\" enough...  Tim Burton and Johnny Depp over did it.  I suppose that's what Disney wanted or else they could have picked someone else to direct/produce and star in the film, but in my opinion they both were not the best choices.  The only live human who really \\"worked\\" was Helena Bonham-Carter as the Red Queen.  She was fantastic.  Ann Hathaway as the White Queen was strange, Mia Wasikowska did not seem like the lively Alice of the book or of the earlier animated version of Disney's Alice in Wonderland and again, Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter was overkill.  The whole production was overkill and too far off the farm... and it ruined the story, which is a shame because the original story is an awesome one.<br /><br />p.s.  A rating of PG was a little low considering the intensity of the film.  I think PG-13 would have been a better choice... very small children may be frightened.

B000002JEV|5.0|People familiar with the 1973 and beyond Led Zep such as the Song Remains The Same movie will probably consider them to be the huge self indulgent behemoth that the 70's version of punks reviled. However even though their was even then, more to them than that stereotype, up until 1972 they were a young hungry band blending diverse influences brilliantly. On this album we see the highly skilled, capable, hungry improvising musicians. They know their craft but take nothing for granted. I love the first Whole Lotta Love. Nearer to the original and with staggering vocals from Plant. We hear their love of blues and rockabilly in the cover versions. I like all Led Zeppelin (most anyway) but particularly before they began to wear stage clothes and display a few pretensions. On these gigs every thing good about Led Zeppelin is to the fore and the indulgent (just because you can play Dazed and Confused for half an hour doesn't mean you should!) is kept to a minimum. What a thing it must have been to see Zep at this point in their career.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

B0029LHW68|2.0|What happened here? The first two albums were amazing and the first two songs I heard off from this album were awesome (Kings and Queens, and This Is War. Those two songs also are lies, leading you to believe the album would be like that. Sadly the rest of the album was pretty much glorified with electronics and lots of kids singing in many of the tracks. Almost all but gone is the rocking guitar work these guys used in prior albums. Case and point the band went as far to work with KANYE WEST on a track. Yes, you read that right unfortunately. A few other songs are alright, but the two best that will remind you of the prior two albums are the aforementioned songs. A few other standouts I thought were good were, Search & Destroy, Closer To The Edge, and Vox Populi.

B00127RAJY|3.0|This workout is good, it's not great however.  I am in good shape, workout 5-6 days a week and do cardio and weights.      Here's my problem with Jillian - she is way to full of herself and it is annoying, here's some examples:    As soon as level 1 starts, Jillian walks in with this \\"full of myself\\" attitude.  Scripted of course; saying to the other 2 girls doing the workout with her, \\"so you think you can handle it huh, we'll see\\" - obnoxious.      Then she gets really full of herself when she says \\"I'm hoping you know me, (with a smug look on her face) I'm Jillian\\" - not needed, come on.      Shortly thereafter she says \\"if you want to look like this (as she is pointing to one of the girls) watch her, and you'll get there in no time......right.....ya, right\\" - are you kidding me, you are supposed to be encouraging people, not belittling them.    So, if you can get past her annoying attitude, it's an okay workout, but not as good as Beachbody.

It's a mystery/thriller starting out with lots of gore in the park and continues with lots of plot twists and turns.  Secondy, it's set in the last days of the old Soviet Union.  I've only been to the USSR once, but the corruption nad double-tripple-quadrupale standard the story describes coincides with my limited knowledge of what it was really like.  I sometimes had a problem keeping up with the plot twists and the names.

B0033WH6UE|3.0|When The Formation Of Damnation first came out in '08, I was very excited. It showed the Testament that fans of The Legacy, The New Order, and Practice What You Preach really wanted to hear. Not saying that fans didn't want to hear another Gathering sounding album or that it was a bad album. I loved The Gathering. But Alex Skolnick was back in the band, and his presence was heard on Formation. It was like old and new. Now we have the tour edition, and I must say....don't waste your time if you already own the album. They basically took the standard cd (original artwork and all), put a cardboard sleeve over it, and put a bonus cd inside the sleeve. Now, I'll admit that Metal Blade did the exact same thing with Unearth's The March, and I bought into that. But at least it had a bonus dvd with a lot more cool stuff than what you'd get here. What you get with this edition of Formation is a bonus cd with three live tracks, and as a cd enhancement (for those that don't know, there's a logo that says enhanced cd on some cd's you buy. That means you put the cd in your computer for additional content like video content and such.), the music video for \\"More Than Meets The Eye,\\" and the video footage of the same three songs you hear on the same disc. I was at least expecting a bonus dvd of some sort, like the one that came with the import version of the album that has the making of it. That would have been better, or if it was a full live concert dvd or cd, that would have been great too. Anyway, I'm a big fan of the album, not this edition though. If you don't already have the cd, go ahead and get it. If you do, don't bother upgrading to this version.

1847242537|5.0|As  others have mentioned , there is a twinge of sadness  that goes along hand in hand with the Millennium  Trilogy of which this is  the beginning. As the books  and characters  captivate  heart and imagination  the thought that they will have  died  with their author  continues to grow until the last page has been turned..  Such a shame... Stieg  Larsson's untimely demise  has deprived us of  much pleasure...  While this is perhaps the slowest  of the three novels making up the trilogy , it  has a  momentum that rolls along  quietly until its  sudden ,shocking  and  violent  climax.. These are  much more than crime novels.. They are fine  entertaining reads that transcend the genre over and over again ... Such a shame that we will have no more.....

It is the sickest kind of propaganda possible full of graphic horror what kind of a demented mind would even think of such stuff - someone like Jeffery Dahmer? Scalping people was a whiteman's invention and I am so sick of the promotion of this kind of BS and the Jewish holocast when the American holocaust was much worse the East Coast was well populated with Native people and they were brutally slaughterd in many, many ways to the point there a very few Natives left there. No wonder our country is so messed up with this kind of garbage being even nominated for academy awards, that is sooooo wrong. I will never watch another movie by any one of these people again, I have totally lost respect for every one of them. I tried to give it no stars but it wouldn't let me.
B00006BTCA|5.0|First things first: Interpol are NOT the new Joy Division, and any attempts to pretend they are is not only unfair but unproductive. Apart from the fact that a new band shouldn't be burdened with such unrealistic expectations on their debut album, the reality is that Interpol don't really sound that much like Joy Division.     Sure, a few songs here ('Obstacle 1', 'Stella..', 'Hands Away', 'Leif Erikson') capture the dark, fragile beauty of the Manchester foursome: choppy, chiming guitar, melodic bass lines, haunting vocals. But the remainder of 'Bright Lights' is more diverse. 'Obstacle 2' and 'The New' display some warmth in both music and lyrics, 'Say Hello To The Angels' has a driving Lust-For-Life stomp, and songs such as 'PDA' and 'Roland' show more straightforward punk and even noise-rock influence. Sometimes they mix styles within the same song, such as how the sparse fragility of the opener 'Untitled' or the warmth of 'The New' dissolve into a walls unsettling guitar distortion by the end. Far from being a derivative post-punk clone, Interpol showcase a greater variety of influences than they are often given credit for.    And, yes, Paul Banks does sound a bit like Ian Curtis, but that's all. Unlike Curtis' relentless urban bleakness, Banks' lyrics are generally much more personal, often displaying a curious mix of boyish innocence and New York swagger. I seriously doubt Curtis would have come up with lines like \\"I feel like love is in the kitchen with a culinary eye\\" or \\"We have 200 couches where you can sleep tight\\" or \\"Hook my up and throw me babycakes\\". Interpol give you darkness and despair, but they also offer you hope and comfort. It's this tug-of-war between bleakness and tenderness that makes 'Bright Lights' so breathtaking and memorable.     So no, they're not the second Joy Division. They're the first Interpol. But that's just fine by me.
B001OQCV2E|3.0|if nothing else,this end of the world flick form disaster specialist Roland Emmerich was entertaining.there sure was a lot of CGI used here.in fact probably ninety percent of the movie is comprised of it. December 21,2012 is the day that the Mayans predict a cataclysmic event will occur on earth,which has led to speculation that the world as we know will cease to exist.the movie only makes passing reference of the Mayan's,and instead just focus on on the destruction and mayhem side of things.maybe it's just me,but the special effects don't seems to have improved much in the last six years or so since the The Day After Tomorrow another big budget disaster opus,also from Roland Emmerich,which had a nearly comparable amount of CGI.or maybe i'm just jaded,and CGI really isn't that exciting more.either way,2012 failed to fully engage me,on an excitement level.the movie does however,has one thing in its favour.unlike many flicks of the genre,there were no real maudlin or sappy moments,no over the top corn ball inspirational speeches.and i loved Woody Harrelson's character.i also thought Thandie Newton was good as well.the movie wasn't boring.and for a movie that clocks in at 150 minutes before the end credits roll,that's something.for me,2012 is a 3/5
B002GY9F9K|5.0|Stumbled across this series through netflix and I was immediately taken in by the characters and storyline...quite the beautiful combination of heart and strength woven between and around our main 'heroes'.

Highly recommend!

B00361CAEE|5.0|I expected this to be all about the editor of Vogue, but it's about the people around her as much as it's about Anna herself.  The relationships between the editors, photographers, and designers are just as interesting as the details about how Wintour runs the magazine.  The film is a little slow at points, but it's definitely worth watching.  Video quality using VOD with Tivo was quite good.

B0019N8P2W|4.0|...and just like the man who created the \\"15 minutes\\" terminology, Andy Warhol, Daria was very weird, intelligent, with often no style at all, which basically made her stylish all in herself. It's good that MTV is bringing this back to show these spoiled know-it-all kids what MTV was about for a brief moment of time. That being said, if you are a fan of cookie cutter shows like \\"The Hills, Jersey Shore,\\" or even \\"Twilight\\" (that horribly awful movie that is ironically being advertised with this as a bundle), then you probably will not like Daria. And I normally don't support MTV, but for the re-release of this series to DVD I want to say thanks to the network. And as another reviewer pointed out, BY ALL MEANS keep the original music that was played in the series on this release. Now if only they would encourage the producers of Daria to do a new series on the channel....
0670021652|2.0|Ok, I'm probably only one of the only women in the U.S. who hasn't read Eat, Pray, Love; that being said, I came into reading Committed with a blank slate opinion of the author and her past experiences.  I have to agree with some other reviewers when they say this book is creepily reminiscent of our college sociology textbooks, dissecting and overanalyzing every little minute detail on the concept of marriage.  It was all just a bit much, without much lightness to balance it out. It was too much teaching and research, which I guess if you're doing research on marriage, it would be a great resource for you, but otherwise it was pretty darn dry.  I admit I am a little biased, having been married and divorced twice now.  I did feel a bit silly reading a book on marriage and devoting this much time to it, when I fully intend to never get married again, and yes I get the irony of that being the author's beginnning standpoint as well.  She was trying so terribly hard to convince herself that it was alright to get married, it ended up feeling as if \\"if you have to talk yourself into that much, maybe it really wasn't meant to be after all.\\"  I get that she and Felipe feel they were \\"forced\\" to marry by Immigration, and boy did it ever feel forced.  I hope they get some rewards out of their hard-pressed marriage after all.
0783227434|3.0|Silly--which is not to say bad--American fluff. The Army of the Dead (really skeletons of The Three (thousand) Stooges complete with eye-pokes and other Stooge slapstick) try to defeat the medieval forces of good. They are doomed, of course, because those forces are led by a handsome American stud whose face is cut just right and who happens to have, in these middle ages, a durable chainsaw, a big gun, and a hot car. Charms the chastity belt right off the castle hottie and slaps the smiles right on the open-minded film viewer.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|this book really made me think. it reached out and really pulled me in. it was a touching story about friendship and also had a thought-provoking plot. i highly recomend when you reach me.
B000000OQF|3.0|When I first heard this album I was pretty excited, it was a fun listen.  The truth is that it really hasn't stood the test of time for me.  I really can't listen to it anymore.  I would give it less then three stars based on how I feel about it now but that would not be fair, because at one point I had a much higher opinion of the music.  Most everybody has heard at least half of the album on the radio, so you should know if you like it or not.  This band seems to have somehow attained much more respect then they deserve.  This is a cool album at first but it is nowhere near the classic masterpiece that people will insist that it is.
B001OQCV2E|2.0|Like many of the disaster movies of late, \\"2012\\" deals with the decimation of life on Earth as we know it.  While the scenarios depicted in this film are theoretically possible, they aren't apt to be actively feared.  Part of the success of a disaster film is making the viewer imagine the horror of being in the depicted situation.  Since nothing like the events depicted in \\"2012\\" has happened in recent history, it's difficult to imagine the events really happening.  There have been disasters recently, but nothing like those in this film.  The effects are believable, and interesting if you enjoy watching national and global landmarks being destroyed.  The film, however, is hard to believe.  Reviews have called it the \\"best disaster movie in history\\", hardly.  \\"The Towering Inferno\\" and \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\" both made in the 1970s, involve scenarios that could and actually have happened.  And even though all disaster films tend to infuse clumsy melodrama into the mix, the two aforementioned films from the 70s top anything made in the genre in the last 15 years.  Interesting, and nicely tied up in the end, the film gets 2 stars from me.
B001QOGYFY|4.0|Overall, this is a good movie...but the ending is a little week.  What is nice is the action and suspense is set in antartica.  So the back drop is very enjoyable.  Its worth seeing
B001B51B9M|5.0|I am old enough, alas, to remember the original movie and young enough at heart to appreciate blue-ray technology, so actually I enjoyed this movie very much. It is a set piece, a very restricted musical, but it is still fun. I don't think there is another movie quite like it. The costuming and sets look really good on our large screen TV. The musical itself is a glimpse of a past farther back--the 1900s--than the glimpse of the past--1962--served up with 2010 technology. Cool.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|The first season was excellent.  I am not a movie buff or show expert by any means but i truly enjoyed the entire first season.  My wife read all the books and said that the movie had differneces,but it was still exciting and new.  Most enjoyable season, and looking forward to season two and three.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|Plain and Simple, it is a movie with fire, explosions, fast cars, planes outrunning things, a world ending scene, huge \\"indestructible\\" ships, and never ending excitement.  All that I want in a good action movie. I'm not going to waste my time writing a better review because I think the best things in life are simple. Simple as that. I like the movie, some people don't and that's ok.
B001OQCV2E|4.0|This movie certainly has many things to complain about from way too many close escapes and outlandish lucky breaks to lack of character and relationship development, but in the end, this is the kind of movie we watch because of the disaster story, and in that respect, the movie is pretty true to some of the books and ideas it is most likely based on. The Earth crust displacement theory has kind of been left behind, even by Graham Hancock, author of the Fingerprints of the Gods, the book that the movie was supposedly based in part on, but in general, this movie is based on a lot of ideas from not only that book, but books on the Mayan calendar, the  Yellowstone caldera and probably a few others. Of course many of these ideas are just plain outlandish and scientifically unfeasible or would represent a highly unlikely confluence of events with very low odds of happening all at the same time. However, all that being said, this isn't the kind of movie we watch because we think it represents what really might happen. It's the kind of movie we watch because we think it would be interesting and entertaining to see visually what it might look like to see some of the things people suggest in disaster books. The director's previous movie, The Day After Tomorrow, was a similar example of this, being based mostly on the book The Coming Superstorm. Now this movie plays into the popularity of The Fingerprints of the Gods. I would recommend this movie for entertainment purposes and because it does reference a number of disaster scenarios. Just don't go into it thinking it is a realistic portrayal of something that's scientifically possible.
B002SJIO4A|5.0|Out of all my friends who watched this movie, I am in the minority because I am the only one who loved this film.      It was hard to watch at first because it is filmed partially in a documentary style and when humans gave their opinions of the aliens, my heart broke because I knew that the attitudes and descriptions imparted by those interviewed were similar to how the whites described blacks during the period of apartheid in South Africa.   The same kind of disdain for another living being.    Anyway, after I stopped the film and collected myself and then thought.... \\"this is a like any other sci fi movie.\\"  I turned it back on sat back with some chips and thoroughly enjoyed this film.    Yeah, they're aliens and they are not cute like E.T but one cannot help but root for them because the humans who were supposed to help them treated them terribly.  Turned many of them into addicts, did horrible experiments on them and I hate bullies so....    This movie had everything in it from humor to action to even a sweet moment between an alien parent and their child.    Highly recommend this movie!!!

B001PPLJIQ|5.0|I read this book more than ten years ago and will never forget it.  But that didn't stop me from loving this 2008 film version which received several Academy Award nominations including a Best Actress award to Kate Winslett. The film explores the many faces of guilt and redemption and doesn't necessarily draw conclusions.  It just tells a story and lets the viewer be the judge.  And, when it was over there was much to ponder about.<br /><br />The film is set in Germany and opens in 1958 when Kate Winslet, who is employed as a ticket-taker on a bus, befriends a teenage boy, played by David Kross, who is sick. Their relationship blossoms into a full blown affair in which they take baths together and he reads to her.  Suddenly, she leaves him and he is heartbroken.  Fast-forward to 1966 when he is a law student observing a trial against six female former Nazi concentration camp guards.  He is shocked to see her as a defendant, especially when the other five women accuse her of being in charge.  He has information that could help her but he keeps silent.  Years pass, and Ralph Fiennes, who is cast as the grown up boy, tries to redeem himself.  How this all plays out is the stuff of fine theater.<br /><br />Subtle questions are raised.  What is the nature of guilt?  Why do people keep silent?  How does this effect a person's life?  The film is a allegory for what happened in Germany all those years ago when ordinary people got caught up in what they considered just doing their jobs or keeping silent to protect themselves.<br /><br />This is a truly fine film.  The acting was exceptional and the mood and tone were perfect to explore the ambiguities of human nature.  I give it my highest recommendation.  Don't miss it.

The top is hard so maybe better protection. No one near by had a beach crocs so why not try this one.<br />  First problem I ran into was that I wear size 12 shoe. I wore size 11 in the Santa Cruz. I had to go to size 10 in this shoe. The 11 was just too big.<br /> Second problem. I tried to take a short walk in this shoe. The left shoe rubbed on the side of my foot. I added a band aid and new socks for this issue.<br />  Third problem. The right foot did not feel good on the heal of right foot.<br />  Fourth problem. The shoes do not have enough ventilation for heat.<br />  Fifth problem. I do not walk well in these shoes.<br />I do not like the shoes.<br /> The Santa Cruz are much better than these.<br /> They are a hard material so they will give some protection for hard objects outside but the bad issues are 10 to every good one.<br />Update:<br /> These shoes are real hot and dangerous to wear for long periods of time. No air for feet. I have worn them a lot though and they do not have holes so I can work in the yard with them. I have sweated threw my socks on a cold day next to the computer. They have held up so far though. Note: Mine is the specialized version.<br /> I ended up never wearing these shoes. I lowered the rating based on that.
B001HN694K|4.0|I am no great fan of Tim Burton's work. I find it tends to all be basically the same movie with slightly different costumes. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Edward Scissorhands and Batman Returns, for example, all felt very similar to me. In fact the only one of his movies I enjoy and want to see again and again is Ed Wood.    Well, now to this list we can probably add Alice in Wonderland.    The movie takes place some twelve years after the original story that most of us are familiar with from the Disney version. Alice, now 19 and on the verge of marriage, freaks out a bit and finds herself down the rabbit hole once more. She has no memory of having been here before, and all the folk she meets, like the White rabbit, the March Hare, the Doormouse and, of course, the Cheshire Cat and the Mad Hatter, aren't sure she is who she says she is. Well, the Hatter might be, but he's mad.    All those worthys are engaged in a little light rebellion against the Red Queen (played by Helena Bohnam Carter, who appears to be channeling Miranda Richardson's Queen Elizabeth from Black Adder II), who sics the Bandersnatch and Jub Jub bird on anyone who challenges her authority. With the Knave of Hearts by her side, she wages a campaign of tough hate on the people of Wonderland as her sister, the White Queen, does frak-all but wait for Alice to turn up, obtain the Vorpal Blade and go snicker-snack on the Jabberwocky.    If all this sounds a little on the mixed-up side, it is. The only thing we're really missing is an appearance by the Walrus and the Carpenter, and I'm surprised we didn't have them show up.    But despite mixing in just about everything from Lewis Carrol's works, the film isn't muddled and stays surprisingly coherent. It's helped by some great performances (including Johnny Depp as the somewhat restrained Mad Hatter), and an incredible production design that uses some of the old-style illustrations of the characters to make them look very inhuman, particularly the Red Queen and the Tweedles.    At no point was the movie boring and at no point did it fail to entertain. As an adult, I don't recommend seeing it on a Saturday afternoon, like I did, but rather suggest seeing it while all the little kiddies are in school. Also, since the theatre I go to still does not have 3-D capability, I had to see it in 2-D, so I can't say how it would look in the other format.    But, yes, this was a film worth seeing, so kudos to Tim Burton and company! Oh, and for the record... they both have quills.
B002TVQ4HG|5.0|I bought this movie on the sole image the name created in my mind. I was excpecting another Bermuda Triangle  Rewrite and was very pleasantly misled. As long as the story unfolded I COULD NOT  take my eyes off the screen. It was so refreshing to see a movie with a different perspective on psychological horror. Totally well thought out & exacuted to perfection without relying on FX, big name B quality acting, crappy shortcuts & riped off formulas. Don't wanna give away a smidgen of the plot, but if your ready for some really desent kick-ass<br /> cinema, look no further, the shizzle is right here, CouchCat

The show features Celtic Woman's strongest line-up yet with the inclusion of the STUNNING voice of Hayley Westenra.    The DVD also features Celtic Woman's best track-list to date. Whereas I found the other DVDs contained a few too many uninspired numbers, there are a truckload of terrific tracks on this little beauty. Impossible to pick a favourite.    The setting for this show at Slane Castle is a visual stunner.    A superb show to be enjoyed by all ages.

1401323820|3.0|I was really looking forward to reading the book, being a fan of the 'Castle' TV series. Unfortunately, the book is not very well written, full of clichés and too close to the series itself. The story reads like an episode of the series with the characters renamed, when I would have expected a more original approach, e.g. a book about a female cop based upon the series' Beckett character but with everything else being different. By staying too close to the series, the book is a mishmash between a series tie-in novel and a standalone book, and for me that was really confusing.    The crime story is okay, but not really a page-turner and for the first half downright boring. The whole heat scenario felt more like a gimmick and is not written very convincingly. I would therefore not recommend this book (being a sub-par crime novel) to someone who doesn't know the series. And to those who do know it, just don't expect too much.

0385341075|2.0|Don't get me wrong: Except for one thing, this is a well-written and engaging novel. But the one thing is that, in the course of the last fifty or so pages, the author turns on his characters in a way that I can only describe as vicious, either destroying them physically or poisoning whatever affection the reader may have had for them -- or both. The violence that introduces this last part of the book is portrayed in such a casual, almost matter-of-fact way that I was tempted not to finish it. I continued reading to the end in the hopes that there would be some sort of redemption in the offing. There wasn't.<br /><br />Several of the blurbs on my copy of \\"The Elegance of the Hedgehog,\\" by Muriel Barbery, used the word \\"heartbreaking,\\" thus providing me with a heads-up about what was coming.

158234082X|5.0|I can recall standing at the best seller table in the center of Barnes & Noble holding a copy of \\"Kitchen Confidential\\" when it was first published.  Not having been a fan of Anthony Bourdain, I quickly put the book down and went about my shopping.  As time went by, I would frequently hear references and comments being made about \\"Kitchen Confidential.\\"  Having more of an open mind these days, I decided to read the book and see what all the fuss is about.  \\"WOW!\\"  I have a new-found respect for Anthony in many aspects and now am definitely a fan.  Reading this book was like sitting down with a well-known, seasoned and well-respected chef listening to him reminisce about his career as a chef.  I experienced multiple \\"foodgasms\\" and found myself devouring each page with voracity until the very last page was turned.  Talk about dispelling any fantasies or notions of any kind of glamour in being a chef.  Having worked in restaurants myself, I did know of some of the chaos and craziness Anthony Bourdain describes in the book, but \\"boy, oh, boy\\" did he open my eyes and teach me a few things.  I can't wait to read everything he's written.

0385528752|5.0|In \\"Switch,\\" Chip and Dan Heath discuss how positive change happens among individuals, organizations, and in society as a whole; they also point out the forces that tend to block it.  In the tradition of Malcolm Gladwell, Dubner and Leavitt, Dan Ariely, and many others who have written best-selling books about various aspects of human behavior, the Heaths hold our attention by telling terrific stories, using memorable catch-phrases, and presenting their provocative ideas with flair.<br /><br />The book is divided into three main sections, each one addressing an important aspect of making change happen.  The first is \\"Direct the Rider\\" (appeal to reason), the second is \\"Motivate the Elephant\\" (influence others by engaging their emotions), and the third is \\"Shape the Path\\" (alter the environment to make change less onerous).  \\"Switch\\" is a model of organization and lucidity, with stimulating concepts that flow effortlessly and interconnect seamlessly.  However, what makes the book so entertaining are the engrossing and sometimes humorous anecdotes as well as the intriguing studies that the Heaths use to support their arguments.<br /><br />What should a boss, a wife, or an individual do to encourage someone to alter his or her behavior?  Is it better to appeal to the Rider, the Elephant, or both?  Although many of us have good intentions, often our noble plans go awry.  Chip and Dan Heath believe that even seemingly intractable behavior can be changed using such techniques as making the abstract concrete, highlighting successes rather than failures, and giving well-defined instructions.  It is also helpful to set up inspirational goals that inspire optimism and hope.  When we accuse others of being resistant to change or just plain lazy, it may be that our suggestions do not resonate because they are too negative or imprecise.<br /><br />The Heaths admit that no book is a panacea, but at least the techniques that they emphasize are practical and inexpensive, \\"simple enough to remember and flexible enough to use in many different situations.\\"  Like Atul Gawande, whose New Yorker article about checklists is mentioned in \\"Switch,\\" the authors propose realistic steps that anyone can take.  Two examples are \\"solutions-focused brief therapy,\\" which concentrates on what can be done right now to ameliorate difficult situations, and holding up successful initiatives (\\"bright spots\\") as an example to others (\\"What's working, and how can we do more of it?\\").  Each section has a \\"clinic,\\" in which the Heaths describe a situation that calls for change; they challenge us to come up with a solution.  The authors, who base their findings on extensive research, include extensive endnotes, a bibliography, and a useful index.  This is an invaluable handbook that can make anyone a change agent at home, at work, or in the community.

0385523904|5.0|I'm not a big non-fiction reader, but this one had me from the photo heading up Chapter 1 -- a satellite photo of both Koreas at night -- so many lights in South Korea and virtually none in North Korea.    Demick follows the lives of six North Koreans who eventually defected to South Korea.  She interviewed them extensively about all aspects of their lives when she was there working for the LA times.  Her language is clear and the stories are both wonderful and heartbreaking.  The defectors are women and men, the \\"party faithful\\" who lost faith, and the outliers who always felt unhappy.  I'm in awe of everything about this book -- the reporting, the subject's openness, their lives, the politics -- it's all unbelievable and exactly human.  I couldn't stop reading.
B002QQ8HAG|2.0|Well, this was a mistake, and it shows that not all fashion industry films are anywhere near as good as \\"Valentino\\". At the end of Valentino, you grasp what made the man tick. At the end of \\"The September issue\\" you understand nothing about either famed editor Anna Wintour or the September issue of Vogue, the most important one of the year. Wintour has a mixed reputation, I think it's fair to say, for being brilliant at what she does while interacting coolly with others. Yet this film does nothing to examine or explain how she has stayed at the top of her trade for so long. She comes across as cold and capricious with a strong desire to say as little as possible of interest and the documentary crew doesn't seem to know how to handle her. So we watch her in endless boring meetings about the issue and, about every five minutes or so, she's in the small white-walled room where they examine the proofs for the pages. Her long-suffering creative director complains endlessly about how Wintour is throwing away thousands of dollars of work and yet stays in the job. Nowhere do we deepen our understanding of how Wintour does what she does or what makes her tick. We move from New York to Paris to London to Rome and back to Paris and then return to New York and learn little at any of the stops. This is a seriously shallow and boring documentary.
B00243FQFA|5.0|Not exactly my favorite season of SG: Atlantis, but it did have some really good episodes.  The first and foremost was the conclusion to season 4 with \\"Search and Rescue\\".  While I think they (the producers, directors, writers, etc) could have made this a two-parter, I liked how it all fit together, but the beginning kind of eluded to the possibility of the Atlantis team following another Lt. Ford storyline, which never developed due to the show's early demise.  In this episode, there seems to be a sort of deeper bond between Teyla and Sheppard, but it's a mutual understanding that both of them want nothing more than a deep friendship.  Kind of sucks that was never fully developed.  I (among many fans) probably would have loved to see a more deeper relationship between Teyla/Shep to develop.<br /><br />Second episode that makes this season worth watching is \\"The Shrine\\".  Dr. McKay has come a very long way since we first saw him on Stargate: SG-1.  The character of McKay seems to grow a little more dynamically in this episode, especially at the end when he realizes that he's in love with the good doctor, although many fans (myself included) agree this match-up was something thrown together to satisfy fans' request to have McKay put into a relationship to see how he would deal with it.  Although we don't get to see much develop here, it's good to see that the McKay we all know and love has grown a little more gentler and, dare do we even say it, polite?  Another episode that is my personal favorite is \\"The Daedalus Variations\\".  I just love science fiction shows that sort of touch on alternate realities like this one, and especially when it involves a ship that mirrors like the ship of the original reality in the series'.<br /><br />There were, however, some episodes that I thought, in my honest opinion, didn't really make much sense, though in retrospect, the series was ending, so the writers and producers didn't have time to fully engage the viewers into a potential new threat to Atlantis.  We're talking of course about the episode \\"Whispers\\".  This episode really didn't do much for me in the way of what I consider classic \\"Stargate\\" storytelling.  There wasn't much comedic drama, not much in the way of giving the cast more dynamic roles.  It seemed to me that the two main characters, Sheppard and (clone) Beckett, were just going through the motions, and not really interacting as much as they should have.  As for the side characters, there's really only two words that sum these gals up in my mind: \\"EYE CANDY!\\"  Nicole de Boer (from ST: DS9 season 7 \\"Ezri Dax\\") really didn't have much of a role here, but I confess, it would have been nice to see her come back as a regular to the series in later seasons, if SGA had been renewed for another season or two!!  *shakes fist*<br /><br />Another episode that I thought had some good elements, and some bad aspects to it was the mid-season two-parter \\"First Contact\\" and \\"The Lost Tribe\\".  Admittedly, I have only watched these two episodes twice, but I have an inkling of where the writers were going with this side story.  Who knew the Asgard had brethren in the Pegasus galaxy that had no regard for human life, or really any life for that matter when it came to devising a technology to defeat the powerful Wraith.  This would have made a great arc to the SGA series had it been allowed to develop in later seasons, but it would have left a bad taste in fans' mouths with the newly found Asgard Pegasus tribe to be foes rather than friends.  Another downside/upside to this two-parter was Dr. Jackson's appearance.  Though it was really a limited contribution, and it wasn't like the character had much to do with Atlantis.  The writers really shortchanged this idea severely when they could have done so much more to the story here.  I think had the writers and producers done it more in-depth, this two-parter would have been the turning point in keeping the series alive for another three, maybe evenfour seasons.  I would have really liked to have seen more interaction between Jackson and Sheppard, maybe even more of a \\"butting heads\\" between Jackson and the longtime Stargate bureaucrat Woolsey.<br /><br />The latter episodes, \\"Outsiders\\", \\"Remnants\\", \\"The Prodigal\\", \\"Brain Storm\\", and \\"Identity\\" in my view were just thrown together.  There wasn't much involvement in the stories, and the audience I felt was just not engaged.  It was almost as if the writers simply gave up good writing since the show had been cancelled.  I felt as though they said \\"Screw it\\" and just threw things together.  There wasn't very much Teyla/Ronon, Ronon/McKay, Sheppard/Teyla, and Sheppard/Ronon moments to be had, and that I feel was part of the essence of the show was how these characters interacted with one another, and fed off each others' nuances.  Although, with the McKay character falling head over heals for Keller, it's not surprising he was off his usually uncharming self.  And the whole Ronon vs. McKay for Keller wasn't really all that convincing.  I felt like that was just a stare-down contest than anything else.<br /><br />I think all \\"Inquisition\\" was designed to be was a recap for viewers who just joined the viewer-ship of the show.  However, there was a hint of something that was meant to be coming, sort of a \\"federation\\" much like Star Trek only in present day form.  Aside from the recap episode, I really think there could have been much more leeway in how the series would develop with this new side story.<br /><br />Lastly, the two last episodes were great, but there were some flaws in them.  First, \\"Vegas\\" came in with really no explanation, no prologue, nothing to let the audience know why we're viewing an alternate reality vs. watching a regular SGA episode.  Without giving away too much of the episode for those who haven't seen it, let me just say this much.  Prepare to be confused at first.  After about 20 minutes, you'll sort of understand its purpose.  As for how it ends, just like the beginning of the episode, there's no lead out to explain what it meant, until the final episode.<br /><br />This leads me to the actual final episode.  While it does wrap up details, it certainly leaves its audiences wondering \\"Okay, what's next?\\"  Again, without giving away too much about the episode for those who haven't watched it, it's a good 45-minute ride, but that's all it is.  The only thing this episode does is tie-in with the penultimate (next to last) show and explains its significance.  Beyond that, it gets \\"hokey\\".  And by hokey, I mean, sort of weird, and sort of \\"fan gone crazy\\" writing kind of weird.  Let me just put it this way.  Anyone who's seen Star Trek: Nemesis knows (at least by now, I hope) that it was written and directed by a fan of the original and TNG series.  That being said, it goes without saying that the enemy ship is WAY too powerful, even for a Trek film.  Simply way over the top in terms of firepower, tech, etc.  With the final episode of SGA, I felt the same was done here.  Granted, the writers are supposed to be fans of the show, but just like ST: Nemesis, I think they ended up getting too excited in creating a seemingly \\"unbeatable, but beatable\\" enemy Wraith hive ship.<br /><br />A few highlights on this particular episode, we get to see Amanda Tapping reprise her role as Col. Samantha Carter, and we also get to see Major Paul Davis (Colin Cunningham), a longtime unsung hero of the original series Stargate SG-1, and an honorable mention to the late Don S. Davis (Gen. George Hammond).  I think the episode had a little bit of something for everyone, but it could have been done a lot better, and given enough time by the network and MGM, could have made it a two-parter, which is what it should have been.<br /><br />Overall, although season five is NOT my favorite, I'm grateful to own it as part of my entire SGA series collection, and value it as a completion to the series.  Some episodes are worth watchingagain and again, and some you'll want to fast-forward through just to get to the good parts.  It's worth the buy, especially if you're a fan of the series and want to have a complete SGA collection, but it's not by any means the greatest of the series.  I'm still holding out hope that there will be an SGA movie that will further wrap-up details, and further develop story lines and side stories that didn't get to be explored.w it ends, just like the beginning of the episode, there's no lead out to explain what it meant, until the final episode.<br /><br />This leads me to the actual final episode.

B00000K2UX|5.0|Probably one of the very few audio CDs that I own that I can listen to all the way through and NOT have to skip tracks because I find the song distasteful or boring.  The first song \\"Danger Zone\\" by Kenny Loggins gets you going, and in the mood of the movie, and by the time you get to the end with \\"Top Gun Anthem\\" by Steve Stevens and Harold Faltermeyer, you've pretty much got an idea of what the movie is about, and what emotions you are going to feel.  Every song in this soundtrack pretty much mirrors the movie.  A must have for anyone who owns Top Gun, and loves it as much as I do, even if you don't like Tom Cruise, the movie is still a classic to this day, and this soundtrack certainly proves it.
B001GCUO5W|5.0|Martin is always trying to give you the proper mood depending on the movie.  He has done it again.  A great film that we all kind of know what is happening but we love to see it thru Martin's eyes.  For someone who studies film, we can appreciate this film and what it does to us.  It basically gets us dizzy from the start of the movie, and keeps us light headed, because that is the only way to make you enjoy this movie.  Why is this Marshall feeling so sick in the boat?  Why can't his partner get his gun out the proper way? Why are there so many guards greeting these two officers?  Martin gives away the reality in the first 5 minutes of the movie but we become part of Edwards or Andrew's Fantasy and we enjoy every minute of the lie.  Will most likely get nominated for an Oscar for director, film, and maybe even actor (if D. Lewis and S. Penn don't make a film in 2010, he might finally get his well earn Oscar, mainly because of Martin)  If you did not enjoy it, I can understand, it is not meant for some, the way he directed it might come across as clumsy, but actually that is exactly what Martin wanted.  He is no rookie, no one can direct that movie any better.  Perfection and always paying respect to other film makers in order to make it even better to watch.
B000068FXR|5.0|When I was 17 in 1976, I couldn't understand why this album wasn't more popular... and it still defies logic.  33 years later it still sounds great.  My 19 year old son was blown away when I dug it out for him.  Ranks as one of my top ten favorite albums.
0307266303|5.0|For many classic books, the first sentence is the most memorable (e.g. Anna Karenina: \\"Happy families are all alike...\\").  For this one it's the last.  If you try to read the last first, though, it won't work:  the book builds with grace, focus, and humor to crystalline perfection and you can't truly appreciate the last without all that comes before it. Thanks, Christopher McDougall, from another improbable runner.  By any literary or journalistic standard, boy did you score on this one!
0887431453|4.0|Bought for $10 at Wal-Mart. Cheaper here if you get free shipping. As for the quality of the book, I don't know yet. We just bought it. I will say it's certainly BIG. Most of the other workbooks at Wal-Mart had closer to 100 pages.
0307266303|5.0|I'm very much a runner but not much of a reader... this was the third book I picked up to read for leisure purposes in the last 4 years. After I started it, though, I couldn't put it down. It's an inspiring read, especially for a runner. It gives new meaning to my running ability. Nevermind the fact that the book is already very entertaining and thought-provoking. For any runner or anyone looking for inspiration to run, or even someone trying to understand the mindset of a runner, I highly suggest this read.
0380715430|3.0|Entertaining, interesting, fun -- and no editor shouold have let it out like this. The frequency of factual errors is stunning: dozens and dozens I've caught, and that's just a sampling. Other reviewers have listed a number of errors, so I won't recap. Read and enjoy - but you should treat it like Wikipedia: you shouldn't assume that anything in here is accurate without doublechecking elsewhere.
B00338QENI|5.0|This is one of the most fascinating books I have ever read. Even better, it's a true story that combines science with the story of a family and the story of American society yet it reads like a novel or mystery. I couldn't put it down. Others have detailed the plot - all I will say is if you have not read this book yet, don't wait any longer.
B000EHQTZO|5.0|Still very exciting to watch after all these years!  Proud to own it and add to my classic films!
0446569895|4.0|Man, it's amazing how some ghost-writers nowadays are so good. When dealing with these authorized biographies, seldom I've read one that I disliked.<br /><br />This one from Ozzy is no exception. It's very good. Mind you, he does not even tries to make one like him or hate him. He just narrates his life. Man, I caught myself laughing alone at some passages!<br /><br />Of course, I think, at general, one must be an Ozzy fan and have a certain knowledge about his career to wants to read it, because a lot of it has been said before in other bands/artists biographies: sudden rise to stardom, dishonest managers, groupies by th e hundresds, booze and drugs, broken marriages, paranoid ripping the band apart and, in the best scenarios, a reborn career. In the worst cases, death or oblivion by the market and fans.<br /><br />There's a freshness in this narrative that I can not exactly point what it is, but I really had a great time reading it. I would not ge so far as other reviewer said that this was the best book he ever read, nowhre close to that, but I enjoyed it a lot.<br /><br />But, yes, there is a lot of \\"missing in action\\" information here... Jake Lee is barely mentioned (two times). There's nothing about auditioning Zakk Wylde; nothing about the late Randy Castillo, who drummed for him in two albums and died of cancer; nothing about guitarist Joe Holmes or drummer Dean Castronovo, or Geezer Butler going on board. The DOWN TO EARTH, BLACK RAIN and ULTIMATE SIN albums are not mentioned at all, and OZZMOSIS only one time.
B003204MQS|4.0|I've watched many ghost stories for weeks in search of a good old fashioned ghost story. The Haunting (original 1963 version) is one of my favorites. A movie can be scary or creepy without excessive use of computer generated imagery. In fact, personally, the more complicated the special effects are, the more contrived they appear and lose some degree of realism. After many a strike-outs in my search, I was pretty happy with this one. I think a person's satisfaction has more to do with their expectations of it. If you don't expect anything as a general rule, you're bound to be happier with a film.    That said, this one does not use a bunch of heavy-handed special effects, so if you need that, you won't be happy. I will say it is certainly not for everyone. Some people just don't like that type of horror movie. It is sort of the mixture of Blair Witch and The Haunting.     The acting is pretty decent, and while it does use some of the \\"shakey hand\\", home-video-esque filming technique, it does not look like it was done on someone's cheap home camera.     Other movies also tend to lose me when they insist on making a plot some tale of good v. evil explanation. I think randomness and lack of a specific reason for why, has a bit more creepiness.     I didn't have big expectations because lately, I've been repeatedly disappointed, even when the movie had good reviews. But this one was not only worth the rental, I plan to buy it in the future.
0307269981|5.0|Part 2 of a trilogy. make sure you read book one: The Girl with the dragon tatoo first to add to the enjoyment. Book one starts slowly but once it grabs you it keeps you there, the same goes for this one, can't wait for the third book to be released in May. Unfortunately the author died shortly after finishing this series, but celebrate and enjoy his work as I did !!
B002OMZTSU|5.0|I LOVED Craig's book. I already love his show and try and never to miss it. This book was funny, sometimes sad, but truly honest about his life and past. I had a wee bit of trouble with some of the Scottish words and dialect but it made me laugh all the more. Craig is so inspirational and I would bet half if not more could relate to his life... they just wouldnt admit it. I have it on my Kindle and and couldn't put it down...anywhere. People watched me giggle in the strangest of places. I would love to meet him...I feel like I know him and feel very proud of him. &#34;Craig...keep making us laugh and the best to you and family&#34; Krissy from Boston (near)

B001OQCV2E|3.0|If your in the mood to sit back for two hours and a half and watch some mindless entertainment, then this movie will deliver.  As other reviewers have noted, the special effects in this movie are excellent and will keep your eyes glued to the screen when they are doing their best to destroy the world.  As for storyline, forget it.  This movie jumps around so much that your head will spin trying to keep track of what's going on with the characters.  Characters are introduced and then you don't see them again for such a long time that when they reappear you realize you forgot they were even in the movie.  Another annoying trend in this movie is to needlessly kill off sympathetic characters for no legitimate reason.  At least the elephants live...  This movie evokes memories of disaster movies of the past: THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, THE TOWERING INFERNO, VOLCANO, EARTHQUAKE, WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE...Roland Emmerich seemed to want to pay homage to them all in one mixed up, crazy bag of mind-spinning mayhem.    It also reminds you of how skillful Irwin Allen was at putting together a disaster movie with at least a somewhat logical plot, interesting characters saying interesting lines, and not intentionally letting the special effects overshadow his actors.  Yes, Mr. Allen, we miss ya!  Amazon delivered this DVD right on schedule and in great condition.

B002KSPKRS|1.0|within a month of use, the microphone does not work anymore. contact the \\"turtle beach\\" which has only email contact, they took forever to return my emails each time. And, each response does not address the problem enough. Reported the problem to Amazon customer service, which is the best, and returned my email with an offer of full refund. But, I still wanted to have this thing fixed as the sound quality was satisfactory to me, but \\"turtle beach\\" took more than a month to send my email request of a new microphone with a RMA# asking me to ship the whole thing on my own cost to them for repair. I finally gave up, and might as well return back to Amazon for 85% refund due to it has been past the 30 days at this point. Overall, it has been just the most disappointing item I ever purchased on Amazon and the worst (backward and slow) customer service from any merchants I have ever dealt with.

1401323820|1.0|This book was so bad I couldn't even get more than a third of the way through it. Ugh!     What I wanted from this book was a good mystery novel that stood on its own and which added a little weight to the illusion of Richard Castle as a likable, talented, \\"real\\" author. If that had been managed, this would have been a fantastic addition to the overall mythology of the show. As it is, done as poorly as it has been, it manages to drag the show down and demean its characters.    If Richard Castle was real (and a well-regarded best-selling author) then for this to work I, as a reader, would need to believe that he's a good writer. This means the writing shouldn't be so mediocre that the manuscript would have a hard time making it out of a publisher's slush pile in real life. Also, if Castle was the writer (and the person) that the TV show wants us to believe he is, he would NEVER be so unimaginative and incompetent as to insert such a thinly-disguised version of himself (\\"Jameson Rook\\"? Oh, come on!) into the story where he behaves like an arrogant jerk from the very first moment. It intrudes the \\"author\\" into the book in an incredibly ham-handed way.    In short, if you want a good book, this ain't it.

B002T9H2MO|4.0|If ever there were a debut with an elephant in the room this is it. And, here, it's an elephant which no-one seems to want to acknowledge: not the director, not the marketers, and curiously, not the critics: every review you see studiously and kindly and respectfully treats Duncan Jones as just any first-time feature film director. Yet everyone quietly wills him to do well, giving hopeful benefit of the doubt to a feature which, for about 30 minutes, looks to be a pretty mediocre sort of outing.<br /><br />And then it dawns on you that this film isn't ordinary at all, and it's casually dug into some gnarled and complex questions about isolation and alienation, through the metaphor of a lonely and seemingly deranged individual, rattling around in - well, in a tin can - irredeemably isolated, far above the world.<br /><br />And then you notice the big old elephant again, sitting quietly in the room, and you get to wondering what it might have to do with anything.<br /><br />For, to spell it out, the scenes where Sam Bell (a terrific Sam Rockwell) is forced, quite literally, to confront himself, and doesn't like what he sees, resonate very strongly with the artistic output of another [[ASIN:B001JYC1IU fresh-faced British artist]] whose burst on the scene, a generation ago, exploring similar themes through the prism of similar metaphors.<br /><br />Moon doesn't owe everything to David Bowie, of course, but pretending it would have been picked up, financed, viewed or received as it has been had Duncan Jones not been christened Zowie Bowie seems fanciful. That's certainly why I made a point of seeing it. To be sure it is artfully low budget (the crappy miniatures of the moon base are hilarious), its production design is neat and cheesy (somewhere between the [[ASIN:B000EBOZYW The Tomorrow People]] and [[ASIN:B00005UWQT Silent Running]]) and it bears as much resemblance to Silent Running and Solaris as it does to its more obvious analogue, 2001, a Space Odyssey. And here perhaps is another in-joke: Jones, in his directors Question and Answer Session, makes much of [[ASIN:B0000C24F3 Alien]] and [[ASIN:B000VPP84W Blade Runner]] as antecedents and jokes (no doubt referencing Space Oddity), that 2001 was really more an influence on his parents' generation than his own!)<br /><br />I'm not sure I'd put Moon quite in Ridley Scott's league), although robot Gerty, not altogether persuasively voiced by Kevin Spacey, is something of a cross between HAL and Huey, Dewey and Louie.<br /><br />Moon certainly gets better as it goes along: early plot improbabilities (such as why would anyone, let alone a man with a young wife and child, take up a three year janitorial role in solitary confinement on the far side of the moon?) are resolved satisfactorily, and rockwell's excellent performance builds out impressively as the narrative develops. This is certainly thinking persons' sci fi, and I'm pleased I saw it.<br /><br />Jones' next film, he says, will be the \\"spiritual successor to Blade Runner\\".<br /><br />Fighting talk.<br /><br />Olly Buxtonnes, in his directors Question and Answer Session, makes much of [[ASIN:B0000C24F3 Alien]] and [[ASIN:B000VPP84W Blade Runner]] as antecedents and jokes (no doubt referencing Space Oddity), that 2001 was really more an influence on his parents' generation than his own!)

B00333NCTM|5.0|I was laughing from the first page and still laughing when I closed the book. I also cried reading the book a couple of times. (and not just from laughing so hard.) I made my husband read parts of the book because he just couldn't imagine what had me laughing out loud. My favorite part is when they mistake the alarm for the thermostat. I still crack up thinking about that one. Ozzy and Sharon are truly a match made in heaven. Still can't believe she tried to run him and her dad over with a car. In her defense they deserved it!

B0018LMZOO|5.0|\\"Seventh Sojourn\\" marked the end of a run of seven brilliant Moody Blues' albums in six years(1967-1972); this was to be their seventh journey in Mike Pinder's words, and consequently the last of their classic seven albums. Gone are the more exploratory instrumental/ production passages of earlier albums, like \\"In Search Of the Lost Chord,\\" On the Threshold Of a Dream,\\" and \\"To Our Children's Children's Children.\\" Even though I find I gravitate to those earlier releases as my faves, I think \\"Seventh Sojourn\\" is unique because its strength is that it displays all the components that make up a complete song. The arrangements are more concise and complimentary to the vocals. The melodicism is stronger than ever, which if you're familiar with the Moodies' sound, says a great deal. For anyone who doesn't own any MB releases from this era, this may be the most accessible. It's a safe purchase....  you won't encounter any \\"In the Beginning\\", \\"Om\\", or \\"Beyond\\" selections that showcased their more experimental side.<br />Mike Pinder was the Moodies' keyboardist and by far the greatest user of the English instrument known as the Mellotron. He practically conducts a sales seminar on its ability to simulate a wide range of instruments: Check out the accordion part on Ray Thomas' sea chantey, \\"For My Lady,\\" which would make Gary Brooker and Keith Reid (of Procol Harum fame) proud...and those trumpet jabs you've heard all those years on FM in John Lodges' \\"I'm Just A Singer,\\" aren't from some hired brass section, but Pinder's `Tron..<br />He also incorporated an earlier precursor to the Mellotron known as the Chamberlin to offer a purer strings sound in Justin Hayward's \\"New Horizons.\\"<br />Hayward and drummer Graeme Edge's \\"You and Me\\" opens what would be Side Two of the original album. Justin Hayward offers some fine ES-335 guitar work on this track and segues into \\"The Land Of Make Believe.\\" My favorite track on the album and I think one of Justin Hayward's finest vocal performances on any Moodies' record--exquisite melodic lines, one after the other, with searing emotional delivery...M. Pinder's second salute to counter-culture guru Timothy Leary is next in \\"When You're A Free Man.\\" Probably the closest you'll find to the blues form in a Moody Blues' record, this may be Pinder's greatest MB vocal performance...its no wonder that J. Hayward cites this as his favorite \\"Seventh Sojourn\\" track.<br />The bonus tracks are a real treat....particularly Hayward's \\"Island\\"--a post-Seventh sessions recording that never saw the light of day until 2008, and the original expanded version of John Lodge's \\"Isn't Life Strange.\\" After the bassoon line mid-way into the song (don't worry, that's Pinder on the Mellotron/ Chamberlin again, not a real bassoon), there's a simple but gorgeous section featuring Pinder on strings and Thomas on flute. It's such a great surprise to hear how the Moodies intended this classic to be released, sans any marketing or time constraints, after being hidden in the vaults after 36 years! Sorry vinyl purists, but you're not going to find this on any LP format. I know I still have all my original LPs, which I cherish, but none offer the much improved updates you'll get with this release.<br />I've owned this album in several issues, and I think Decca finally got it right with this one. A greater presence and brilliance is evident thru Edges' cymbal/ drum work which I always thought was needed even with the vinyl releases. The low end is boosted throughout and maybe a little too much on certain tracks, which is a trend you're going to see more in the future to satisfy younger listeners (i.e. the recent Doors' reissues, Beatles' \\"Love\\", etc.).  I didn't own the `SS' 1997 Remaster release, but if it was anything like the other MB '97 issues, it was flat, noisy, lacked bonus cuts, and was omitted much of the original album artwork. Six of the original eight `SS' tracks are on the 1996 box set, `Time Traveller,' which is evidence ofthe strength of the material, but the sound is noisier than ever!<br />However, with the 2008 reissue you'll get all the original LP artwork, including the inner disc sleeve, thorough comprehensive liner notes, and valuable bonus tracks that aren't merely filler, coupled with a much needed sonic update.<br />This Moody Blues in 1972 were at their commercial peak: sold-out concert draws, a #1 album, and a bizarre showing of the then five year old \\"Knights in White Satin\\" on AM Top Ten radio. They took a six year break as a band, and later reformed for 1978's spotty \\"Octave\\" LP...Mike Pinder said no to a brand new tour, and left the band after relocating to America. The Moodies would continue on to commercial successes in the `80's, but the magic of their late `60's/ early `70's work would all be behind them....

B00275EGWY|3.0|An entertaining two hours, but very unrealistic because of the risks taken by the ORD soldiers.  Also, when one of the characters returned home, he longed to go back - in reality when you return home even the supermarket is a fun and fascinating place.  Being deployed overseas is overrated (which all soldiers know), and so is this movie.
B000E41MRC|1.0|I failed miserably to appreciate Riefenstahl's great art of filmmaking. Should I have given one star to myself then? I don't think so, because I didn't fail to appreciate, for instance, \\"M\\", 1931 film by Fritz Lang, his Metropolis (1927), or, say, Russian films Okraina (1933) and Bespridannitsa (1937), or Japanese A Story of Floating Weeds by Ozu, as well as many other films produced before 1940.<br /><br />As art of propaganda \\"Triumph Of The Will\\" does not do its work well either. In the first half, where Riefenstahl shows famous Nazi torch parades, one can barely see what's happening on screen. It looks more like not so large a forest fire than an organized night event with torches. Much more smoke than fire can be seen. The second half of the film is plain boring, with countless militray and paramilitary units marching and marching and marching through the streets and squares of Nuremberg.<br /><br />As to the content - I tried to watch this film without any prejudice, but nevertheless found all participants, from the lowest to the highest rank, rather uninspiring.<br /><br />Aesthetics of the Nazi party congress look cheap and tastless in the film. I know that Hitler was able to consolidate the nation, brought to unspeakable misery by the countries which prevailed in the First World War, but I could not find in this film any indication of his famous oratorial skills. The presentation of the Labor Front units for the F&uuml;hrer went on and on, and I could not see why Riefenstahl wanted to spend so much of film time on it.<br /><br />I saw parts of Riefenstahl's Olympia - wasn't impressed either.

B000002UAU|5.0|You want to know how fast time flies? I remember buying this album when it came out 43 years ago, and kind of snickering, along with the band, over the lyrics of \\"When I'm Sixty-Four.\\"    Damn, now I am 64 - and so are these guys.....in fact they are older. I wonder what they think now of that song?    Whatever, this ground-breaking album (CD) was a shock to a lot of Beatles fans back in 1967. It wasn't the normal listening fare, but this \\"new, psychedelic sound\\" caught on quickly and was fascinating. Oddly, in 2010, it's still a great collection of songs that remain very diverse in their presentations.    In other words, this is still good stuff and recommened to anyone, of any age, four to 64 (and beyond)!

B002T9H2MO|5.0|Good science fiction films are rare, great science fictions films are ever rarer -- so do yourself a favor and see this movie!<br /><br />I loved the atmosphere of this movie which captured the old school feeling quite well. They even threw some original \\"Solaris\\" stuff in there which impressed me. The film was satisfying, as it was not just a soap opera in space -- science was an integral part of the plot. Plus, it was scary, which is a must for me in a science fiction film. They even included the requisite robot character, but made the character fresh and new. The emotives were a fantastic touch, BTW.<br /><br />The humorous moments sprinkled into the film were well done and much appreciated. In fact, the last line in the movie is humorous; a clever and intriguing way to end the film.<br /><br />These guys must have watched every good science fiction film ever made to be able to create this movie so effectively. They even worked in elements from movies that I liked, and are good, but that are not considered \\"great\\" or canonical such as \\"Total Recall\\". These guys knew what they were doing and this movie shows it.

I hate that too, since everyone else loved it.
B002VKE1K2|5.0|I give this movie FIVE STARS!!!  I heard so many great reviews about this movie that I had to see it in the theater! I could never have even imagined the movie would be like that. I'm still in disbelief.  My husband and I still talk about it.  After the movie was over the audience clapped and I just sat there unable to move for a while. You see, my mind would not allow me to comprehend what I had just seen.  No, hell NO!!!  No way I just spent time and money watching perhaps the most tedious movie I had ever seen.  I questioned why the audience clapped.  Was it because it was a good movie or because it was FINALLY OVER!!!  Now I understand the concept of less is more.  I loved \\"The Others\\".  I also have a great imagination, but footprints in the baby powder didn't get my heart racing.  Nor did the slight movement of the door, or those LONG BORING rocking sessions by the bed .  OMG, I was amazed that so many people still liked the movie even after seeing it.  I could understand being fooled by the previews, but I can't fathom anything good being said after actually surviving watching it.  See, there must have been some kind of paranormal activity involved to make so many believe that this was actually a scary and entertaining movie.  And for that alone I give it FIVE STARS!!!  It's amazing how they were able to pull that off, truly amazing.  I suppose to be fair I should mention the two times in the theater that I was actually startled.  The entire movie I kept thinking, \\"It's going to get good any minute now.\\" Finally she runs up the stairs and throws Mica at the camera!  I was like \\"Thank GOD! Now it's gonna get good!\\", and then the credits rolled. Oh, the other part was when the theater was perfectly quiet and this loud, non-human like growl broke the silence and I jumped!  Sadly, I can't guarantee that all movie goers got to experience this scare, as it was my husband who was snoring in the seat next to me.  Hmmm...on second thought I wouldn't be surprised if a sleeping, snoring patron was standard during this snore-fest.  I rented this movie a few weeks ago because I wanted a good nights' sleep.  Needless to say I slept like a baby.  Perhaps I should give it six stars! LOL
B002VECM72|5.0|My wife and I don't purchase a ton of movies, but when we see one that is amazing we will.  We both walked out of The Blind Side agreeing that this is one that we will have to own.  I've never come out of a movie more inspired to be a better person.  Absolutely one of the best movies I have ever seen.
0784011176|5.0|An amazing, overwhelming film that really manages to grab your attention right from the beginning. Holly Hunter manages to express a lot with her eyes, she performs with extreme vigor, passion and flamboyancy, you can't take your eyes off her, every moment she manages to convey something or the other to the viewer, Sam Neill and Harvey Keitel are excellent. The film starts with a normal slow pace but gets very dark and bold slowly. The score is beautiful, the chemistry between every co-star is excellent in the film, the film doesn't emphasize on romance or just passionate tales, there is much more than that as the film gets very bold in terms of human sexuality and can be disturbing to the viewer at times. Moreover, the film is a pure example of neat acting and direction, beautiful locations and a priceless Piano score makes the film worthwhile.

0807126063|5.0|This was one of the best novels I've read in a long time.  It deserves a place next to Catch-22.  I laughed out loud many times reading this book.  If someone complains that they don't like the protagonist, they simply don't get it.  He's a turd; you're not supposed to like him.  That being said, it does take a slightly warped sense of humor to appreciate this book.  I just wish the author hadn't killed himself, thus depriving us of a potentially great body of literature.  They definitely don't just give away Pulitzers.
0452289963|2.0|As other reviewers have pointed out, if you're familiar with Buddhism, you're familiar with this book.  I think it became popular because so many westerners don't know, or have read basic books, about Buddhism.
0547258305|4.0|I'm not really into medieval books, but this was beautiful and I was completely surprised at the end.  It's filled with action, romance, and mystery.  I was sad it didn't continue and I wished I could know more about Katsa and Po.  Katsa and Po's love for each other as they truly were was inspiring.  It was very descriptive and well developed. However, I only gave it 4 starts because it wasn't a complete page-turner and some of the characters in the story were left out to dry - it would be nice to know more about what happened to them; and while I loved the \\"girl power\\" it's heavy emphasis on feminism, anti-marriage statement, and young women taking lovers isn't really my taste and definitely not teen appropriate.  But all-in-all, an enjoyable read.
0547258305|4.0|Rival kingdoms, battles against injustice, special individuals with \\"powers\\": this book falls squarely within a fantasy tradition and includes many familiar elements and themes.  They are successfully pulled together in a moderately-paced tale that kept both my 14-year old son and me reasonably engaged, and the book's alternate world is fully realized.  The variety of \\"graces\\" that turn up, the manner in which they are both blessing and curse, and the prominence of the female characters lend sufficient variety to make the book a worthy addition to the field.  The book is also a mix of romance and fantasy, much more romance than typical for the genre, including a love scene that, while neither torrid nor explicit, will probably be something new for the 10 to 12 year-old reader, for whom the book would otherwise be completely accessible.
0061765236|5.0|How far would you go for the one you love? How well do you know your child? Which is worse - that your child is victim or killer? As always Jodi Picoult has us searching our souls for answers to impossible questions. By alternating between past and present, or between one character and another, Jodi never fails to inspire empathy for both victim and accused, and the outcomes are never what we expect. Best of all, Picoult causes us to explore and expand our own world views, and leaves us changed long after the book is done.
0812973992|3.0|The concept is terrific -- capture New York City in the 1970's by detailing the lives of different city-dwellers on the day of Philippe Petit's performance between the World Trade Center towers and the way those lives intertwine.  Unfortunately, in my judgment the book did not come close to living up to its ambition.  Its setting in the New York of the 1970's is a matter of convenience and literary device--so that crime, the art/drug scene, and the Vietnam War can be discussed--but the book gives you no true feel for that era, much less Petit's feat.  You will get much more of both the former and the latter from the extraordinary documentary Man on Wire.  As for the short stories of the lives of the different characters, I found them generally stilted and artificial.  It starts with a traditional Irish-suffering story which at least rang true, if not fresh.  From there, the author attempts to inhabit the minds of prostitutes, young artists, a criminal court judge, four-star mothers of various backgrounds, and so on.  The voices are simply not nearly real enough to pull it off.  Like a soap opera attempting heft.  Not terrible, by any means, but it will not stay with me, and I was eager to be done while only half way through.  I would skip this one.
B003629IPW|5.0|I loved this movie all 18 times I saw it at the cinema during its limited run, and I have seen the single disc edition of the DVD.  The advantage with this 2-disc edition is the additional behind the scenes extras you get on the second disc, which focus on the dancers and musicians that were a part of Michael Jackson's This Is It show.  The Unfinished Rehearsals segment is a real treat, as it provides our first glimpse of the staging for \\"Dirty Diana\\" which was never rehearsed to the same level as the songs that we see Michael performing in the movie.<br /><br />For MJ fans, two discs are definitely better than one.  I just wish that the other extras that are only available on the Blu-Ray version [ASIN:B002UD56I6 Michael Jackson: This Is It [Blu-ray]]could have been included on this double DVD set as well.  So... I'll just have to invest in a Blu-Ray player!

B002I9Z8B2|4.0|The 2002 standard DVD \\"Director's Cut\\" is 116 min..  The 2009 blu-ray was deliberately DOWN-GRADED to 112 min. of the original DVD length.  Presumably the studios wish to double-squeeze us in a few years for the 116 min. \\"re-release\\" of blu-ray director's cut.  Encourage all to speak out via withholding our purchases and buying something else on Amazon as the studios are manipulating us and our \\"voice\\" is heard via our pocketbook.  The 2012 version of 116 min. will be significantly better than the current 112 min. scam!    The film is the best Star Trek of all time, much better than the current garbage Star Trek film w. the new offensively illogical timeline in which cadet Kirk suddenly commands the flagship, Spock has the ability to travel in time but elects not to reverse the genocide of his planet, and a future Romulan w. 30 years of advanced technology elects not to save his planet from genocide in favor of attacking Spock.
0520224787|1.0|I bought Volume I thinking that I'd see if I liked the book before I committed to the massive whole.  I figured that if they sold it separately in multiple volumes, it's meant to be owned and read in chunks.  It was sitting on my shelf for months until I had the time after I finished Tale of Genji, which I purchased at the same time.  When I finally started into it, I was first confused then upset that these highly-touted explanatory notes were nowhere to be found!!!  I can only assume they are provided at the end of the third and final volume, which isn't even available (new) by Amazon!  And now I can't even return it because it's well after the return date has expired.

The only little hitch I would add is the packaging which is not as one would expect. 1 side has a lid and the other side is open with a piece of the packaging \\"stuck\\" to the 3 discs. You just have to ditch this piece of packaging I guess although it does have printing on it like a \\"true end of the box\\". Otherwise, I LOVE it.  Thanks Amazon.

B000053VAF|1.0|The best part of the film was George Carlin. The theme was one which could have been developed into a very funny film, but, sadly, relied upon foul language rather than good humor for its shock value. Foul language has its proper place in comedy and other genres, but here it was gratuitous coming out of the blue for no reason. In a word: juvenile.

B00009Y3L4|5.0|The above statement refers to Sally [Liza Minelli] who, although an attractive and talented girl is as superficial of a person as can be.  This movie is an intelligent and colorful presentation of pre-Hitler, Weimar Germany and...I think...demonstrates the decadence and moral decay that made the ascension of the ultra-moralistic Nazis a possibility.<br /><br />The setting is primarily the weird cabaret scene in Berlin with its denizen of oddballs, transvestites and general weirdos.  Our protagonists...the Minelli and York characters...inhabit this world and aren't even German, being American and English respectively.  York and Minelli establish an odd relationship, all the more strange because York is a homosexual and Minelli is having sex with anyone who will give her a bauble or offer to 'get her into pictures.'  Another homosexual man is introduced producing a weird, three-way menage.  Minelli gets pregnant and, not so remarkably, hasn't a clue as to who the father might be...one of her homosexual lovers or one of her old men who 'befriend' her.<br /><br />Another distorted character is introduced.  He makes his living as a giggolo but falls in love with a beautiful Jewish woman.  Recognizing that the Jews are facing persecution, she rejects his advances.  Her giggolo, however, 'fesses up' that he's a Jew passing as an Aryan.<br /><br />Perhaps not so remarkably, the Nazis don't come off all so bad.  Primarily they are in the background as brownshirts collecting donations and passing out propaganda leaflets.  We see Communist and Nazi posters and graffiti posted everywhere on the walls.  At one point, during a beer-drink, a lovely blond boy...one of the Hitlersjugend...sings a song of Volk und Vaterland.  Beautiful young girls in the crowd stand up and pick up the strain.  Finally everyone, with the exception of a couple of old skeptics, belt out a song of love and national power.  For just a moment we are let into the secret of Nazi success.  It feels absolutely wonderful to be part of a group striving for national love and unity....hope and change.<br /><br />Of course it was a lie....a highjacking of the ideals of youth.  I think we something of the same process now although I doubt that present day Americans are nearly as naive as post Great War, Weimar-era Germsns.a group striving for national love and unity....hope and change.

B000W4KSWO|3.0|This is a fine John Coltrane performance in his lyrical 'My Favorite Things' mode, but 'Duke Ellington and John Coltrane' is distressingly lacking in Ellingtonian feeling considering that the Duke himself was sitting in the piano chair. There's only a couple of moments, particularly when he's playing within the comfort zone of his own rhythm section, that Ellington moves beyond minimum comping. Such moments come on the justifiably acclaimed performances here of \\"In a Sentimental Mood\\" and \\"My Little Black Book\\". Trane also has a showcase for his more intense style of playing on \\"Take the Coltrane\\". But the remainder of this brief album is wan and forgettable. If these two names weren't on the cover, I'd never give this more than a couple of listens. As it is, I've been coming back to this album repeatedly for 20 years now, and I am always struck by how merely pleasant it is. The cover art is strangely apt: two musical giants who, when together, don't quite fill up the space.

B002XMGGK6|3.0|** MINOR SPOILERS ** (nothing you haven't read on the back of the box)    I believe it's going to be difficult to write a review of LAW ABIDING CITIZEN without including spoilers, or giving away some of the plot, but I will attempt to do so.    I went into this movie completely cold, not knowing a thing about it. I hadn't even seen the trailer or read the back of the DVD case.  So the beginning five minutes came as a bit of a shock.  And the ten or fifteen minutes that followed helped elicit real viewer sympathy for what Gerard Butler's character was going through.  His helpless struggle against what seemed to be an ineffective and possibly even corrupt legal system (being represented by Jamie Foxx as Prosecutor, Nick Rice).  His sense of loss, and the resulting pain and frustration could have been enough to drive any man over the edge.    But it is about that point in the movie that any viewer sympathy goes flying out the window, and Butler's character of Clyde Shelton begins to take on the role of antagonist to Foxx's Rice.  Following a ten year passage of time, Shelton re-emerges from obscurity to exact his revenge.  And not just by taking the law into his own hands.  He does that, of course, but so much more.  His vengeance is directed toward the very core of the legal system itself, and he apparently won't be satisfied until he brings the whole thing down.    It's seemingly quite a startling turnaround for his character, until you learn part way through the movie that perhaps Shelton wasn't as innocent and blameless as originally portrayed.  Perhaps he was from a legal standpoint, but from a moral and ethical one, his background certainly comes into question.  You find out he is cold, calculating (to the nth degree), and totally, utterly ruthless. And absolutely everything he does serves his ultimate purpose.    I believe that what knocks this movie down a notch or two in my estimation, is that it goes to the nth degree itself, and then takes it several steps further into the realm of the unbelievable.  Which makes for great Hollywood trash-film fodder, but ultimately lessens the overall credibility and impact of the film. Still, I enjoyed the movie.  It has several 'I can't believe what just happened' scenes that will leave you shaking your head.  But overall it ends up missing the mark, despite a well written script full of unexpected twists and turns.  What could have been an engrossing psychological cat and mouse game ends up being just another over-the-top, character driven revenge drama.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I expected a little more.
B000MV90IU|4.0|The specifications on the package of the Bullitt Blu Ray list the aspect ratio as 2.40:1.  This is not correct.  The aspect ratio is actually 1.78:1.  If you are expecting 2.40:1 you will be disappointed, as I was.  Also, Amazon, on this information page mistakenly lists the aspect ratio as 2.40:1 (probably because the manufacturer has it wrong on the packaging).

1416972242|4.0|This book was an improvement over the first novel in the series.   City of Ashes hit the ground running and swept me right along with the breathless pace of the story. It was packed with action, a side order of humor, and a dash of melodrama that kept the characters on their toes throughout the book. Becoming absorbed in this story for a few hours of light reading was genuine fun, and the climax was well balanced between resolving the plot of this book while at the same time setting up the characters for the next installment.     Jace - The insight into this character made him more interesting and central to the story than I was expecting. It would have been easy to go too far with the angst over his conflicted feelings for Clary and emotional turmoil towards his father. Fortunately, the author wisely chose not to linger on his brooding, instead using it as an opportunity to spur him into action. I'm mildly surprised that by the end of the book I was actually pulling for him, despite my earlier impression of him as shallow, selfish and sadistic. Like he said during the epilogue - if that were true, then he would be just like his father. Unless I'm missing something, it seems as if the whole point of the book may be that Jace is not so nearly so much like Valentine after all.       Simon - It was fairly predictable that something significant would have to happen to this kid in order for him to keep up with the rest of the supernatural cast. Sure enough, that's what occurred, and then some. I gotta give him credit though - Simon is confident about what he wants, and he isn't going to be intimidated by his own feelings or the strange new world he now finds himself a part of. You gotta respect that. The interesting twist was the effect of Jace's blood. Whatever Valentine did to spike his son's DNA, it's clear the ramifications are going to play a major role in the rest of the story.      Clary - I felt sort of bad for her after the first book, what with the brainwashingand being lied to her whole life about it. Now, she's just starting to get on my nerves a little bit. Typical teenager, she blows everything way out of proportion. I found myself agreeing with Valentine - her perceptions are too naive for her judgment of him to bear much weight. To her credit though, she is beginning to realize that she still has a lot of growing up to do before she's ready to take on the big bads of the world she has been sheltered from for so long. Like her brother, we now know that she is uber-special, so I'll give her the benefit of the doubt until we see what happens next.       Valentine - Evil bastard. With a plan. Is he a visionary, or just a misguided idealist on a power trip? What has he done to his kids? How did he do it? Why? Just because he lost his parents and demons are meanies? I'm not buying it, there has to be more to his vendetta against demon-kind than that. Either that, or he truly is psychotic. What are his ultimate goals & what's in it for him? Stay tuned to find out.      Luke - Nice guys finish last. The ordeals he has endured for the sake of Jocelyn, and to a lesser extent Clary, could be considered admirable if it wasn't borderline masochistic. I hope his violent lifestyle catches up with him soon, so he doesn't have to suffer any more. At least there would be some measure of mercy in that.      Strange that the first book was about Clary, but Jace was on the cover. Book two is about Jace, but Clary gets the cover. What's up with that? Anyway, I'm still curious to see what role Jocelyn has to play, and I wonder what the inquisitor whispered to Jace. I'm looking forward to reading City of Glass.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|A pro-American Brit reviews the series:  A few years ago I set a quiz which included the question \\"Who was the second President of the United States\\". Nobody, not even a visiting American got the answer - which seems to sum up John Adams' position in history. Certainly before I watched this fascinating HBO miniseries I knew nothing of the man: now I feel I don't just know about him, I have a much better grasp on his times.  Adams was a Boston lawyer who sympathised with the grievances of his fellow-colonists but not all of their activities. His desire to see justice done led him to defend - successfully - the British soldiers accused of murder following the so-called Boston Massacre, but he was canny enough not to accept the Crown preferment offered to him after the trial. He was a delegate to the Continental Congresses that discussed and finally decided on declaring American independence, a move he promoted, and he became an active spokesman for the new United States.   He certainly wasn't perfect - his courtroom performance tended to long-windedness unless his sensible wife had toned his speeches down in preparation, and when sent to Europe to rally support for the Americans in their War of Independence he proved undiplomatic and not very successful. But his prominence and activities meant he came second to George Washington in the first US presidential election and therefore served as his Vice-President, eventually succeeding him.  Adams served only one term as President but the programme makes clear (and the history books seem to confirm) that he sacrificed his position rather than act in a cynical and political way - he kept the young USA out of a European conflict for which people and politicians were clamouring.  Several things combine to make this mini-series successful. Paul Giamatti turns in a stellar performance as Adams as does Laura Linney as his intelligent supportive wife. Theirs is both a love-match and a true working partnership. Giamatti inhabits the role and his presence and eloquence give him a real presence even though Adams is rendered accurately as a short tubby man (next to the towering George Washington he looks almost hobbit-like). At the same time his flaws such as short temper and stubbornness are not glossed over. The production values are excellent, helped by the wise decision not to try to recreate battle scenes or similar spectacles. Great attention is paid to contemporary living, fashion, manners, habits and speech - it is good to see that not all the Americans speak with modern American accents, many sound very British, as was the case.    Even better, the British are not two-dimensional cardboard baddies. Usually they are off-stage and referred to, but when they appear in the drama they are human.  Actually there are only two such episodes - the scenes involving the Boston redcoats (mainly frightened boys plus a hard-bitten but basically honest professional officer), and later on  Adams' meeting with King George III when he presents his credentials as the new and recognised nation's ambassador to London. The surprisingly generous sentiments expressed on both sides are confirmed by the history books.  But most refreshing of all is the hard look taken at America's \\"Founding Fathers\\" who are seen not as a collection of sanctified noble visionaries but as men, and men who whatever their courage and vision also had their own flaws, personalities and agendas. George Washington is noble and inspiring but not a whole lot more, Benjamin Franklin fiercely intelligent but more than a little devious (though his deviousness sometimes achieves more for the infant nation than Adams' straightforwardness), Alexander Hamilton an ambitious posturing buffoon, and Thomas Jefferson...   Adams' relationship with Jefferson, his successor, is at the heart of the later episodes. From friendship and cooperation they pass through years of political and personal estrangement, only to be reconciled towards their deaths (they died on the same day). Jefferson is shown as noble but flawed, a wealthy man whose vision for America differs radically from that of the self-made and hard-working Adams. And this, I think, is the message of the series and why the realistic or revisionist (according to your views) vision is conveyed. Adams is a federalist. His vision is of a United States with a strong central government, a single nation bound by national institutors.  In other words what the USA is now. Jefferson is the spokesman for the alternative position, a vision of America where the real power resides with the individual states and a weak central government has only such powers as are needed for practical purposes. The tension between the two positions would cause problems for the nation until the huge and bloody Civil War decades later when the \\"states' rights\\" position that inspired the seceding Confederacy was finally crushed and a strong Union was firmly established. Adams, in short, is the man who had the vision of America as she is now. He deserves this rescue from his obscurity.
0545157617|3.0|This was enjoyable, but not nearly as good as most of Donaldson and Scheffler's many other efforts, the best of which include:  [[ASIN:0330507419 The Gruffalo 10th Anniversary Edition]], [[ASIN:0142501123 Room on the Broom]],  [[ASIN:B001TI32EI The Snail and the Whale ]],  [[ASIN:0142402753 The Spiffiest Giant in Town]], and  [[ASIN:1405055286 A Squash and a Squeeze]].

B002VECM6S|5.0|I have always been a fan of romantic comedies where you can see the happy ending from the beginning.  Therefore, I'm a pretty big fan of Sandra Bullock because the genre that she usually goes with is romantic comedy.      I was shocked by her performance in The Blind Side.  She was so believeable as a rich white southern woman that took in a homeless black teenager with no questions asked.  After the movie was over, I remembered thinking \\"She deserves an Oscar for this performance\\".  That premonition came true tonight.  She really earned it.    This is one of my new favorite movies.  I will definitly be buying this as soon as possible.  If you haven't seen The Blind Side, you really should.  It is so good to know that people like the characters portrayed in this movie actually exist.

B0000VCZK2|5.0|The Alien Quadrilogy is a massive 9 disc set that would make any Alien fan require a fresh set of underwear. Included in this baby are 2 versions of each film, the original/theatrical editions and the directors cut/special editions. Along with that, 5 of the 9 discs are packed to the brim with special features; a very conservative count would set the extras at probably over 12 hours, and thats not counting commentaries, trailers, or the LazerDisc features. Protecting all 9 discs is an amazing 10 sleeve digipak with wonderful, glossy art covering each sleeve that, when fully extended, reaches well over a yard long. Covering THAT is a nice indented slipcover with a reflective/rainbow-ish finish. Yes, it is amazing.<br /><br />Alien is the original masterpiece. I cant say much that hasnt already been said, but Alien is a terrific movie that made Ridly Scott's career and established a multi-million dollar franchise. The Directors Cut isnt much of a change from he original. Scott re-introduced some small, unneccesary scenes by shaving milliseconds from every other scene. The result ends up a bit more streamlined than the original film, but not quite better for it. Both versions of the film are suspenseful and extremely well edited, making for a horrifyingly slow movie..in a good way.<br /><br />Aliens is a decent action flick. The years have overrated James Cameron's Aliens; and after seeing for the first time in years, i cant help but feel a bit disappointed. To make up for the rather blunt and unsophisticated special effects, Cameron has edited most actions scenes into little more than a clip is a Marine firing, followed by a clip of an exploding alien. This would have worked well if used sparingly, but nearly every alien/marine confrontation ends up feeling the same. The exception would be the incredible face-hugger sequence with Ridly trapped in a room and, of course, the equally impressive climax. Aliens trumps its prequel in one department however, and thats soundtrack. Both films make incredible use of SFX and ambient/background noise, but Aliens builds on that with an amazingly well orchestrated score. The Special edition of Aliens tends to drag on at times, and feels a bit bloated at over 2:30, but it features sequences that further develop characters as well as some better pacing.<br /><br />Alien 3 (or cubed :P) has always been and will always be an odd beast. The movie never became what anyone wanted of it, and conflicting imaginations hurt the film. The unfortunate (and almost total) reliance on computer generated effects and characters gave an unpolished look to the entire film, as it lacked the sparing use of the creature (as in Alien) or the clever sets to limit the creature (as in Aliens). The monster in Alien 3 is almost always an obvious suit or a terrible CGI. A ridiculous plot and awful death timing (a friend dies much to early in the movie) further make Alien 3 something that cant be called great. The Special edition adds over 20 minutes to the movie, and balances character development in the first half. The first hour of Alien 3 (special) could actually be called a well developed piece of film. The second half is garbage. Despite the obviousness of the less than par movie, i cant help but feel like there could have been an incredible movie.<br /><br />Alien Resurrection is....well, Alien Resurrection. Its the beginning of the nosedive into mediocrity for the Alien franchise. Alien 3 wasnt great, but it wasnt until Resurrection that a movie in the series was actually bad. Its filled with 90's action/horror cliches and an only decent performance by Ryder and Weaver. The separate versions arent for any reason more watchable than each other but id recommend the Director's Cut.<br /><br />Disc 9 fas a variety of features from all of the movies, as well as general Alien features. The majority of the extras are on the corresponding second disc of each film, with a massive documentary going over everything from initial perception to post production and everything in between. Alien Quadrilogy will bring you hours of enjoyment, specially for those interested in special features. At $30, its a steal.verything in between.

0307271862|2.0|One of the most improbable thriller's I have read in years.  With great possibilities in the offing, that is, a village decimated by 19 murders of most of it's elderly population, ultimately found to be related to one another, the novel deteriorates into a nonsensical charade of silly plot and a sillier ending.  Judge Birgitta Roslin is made into a foil for the ridiculous goings-on in the novel as we are \\"treated\\" to a description of the construction of the continental railroad, specifically with two Chinese brothers, only one of whom ultimately survives.  His treatment at the hands of a vicious and brutal Swedish man, JA, is the basis for the killings, ordered by the Man in Beijing, Ya Ru, a ruthless and amoral member of the new capitalistic breed of entrepreneur in China.  With murder continuing to abound throughout, the end is as improbable as my running for president in two years.  Can't and couldn't happen.    Save your money.
B002WY65W4|5.0|Lets be honest, i didn't walk out of the theatre a changed man after seeing this movie, but i did walkout feeling like i had the most fun i have ever had at a theatre. This had comedy, action, great acting, great characters, and even a little love story. Because of that, and a lack of any plot twist, this movie is one of the most re-watchable movies i have ever seen. Defiantly a movie to own, and to watch with friends.
0307386171|4.0|Ian McEwan has the ability to create a world where time doesn't move too fast or too slow. ON CHESIL BEACH, takes a route not a lot of authors can manage and covers a few hours (for the most part) in the lives of Florence and Edward, newlyweds fresh from their wedding, enjoying dinner and their first night together. For the short time we actually spend with them, Florence and Edward are exceptionally well-developed characters.<br />Florence grapples with tricky intimacy and her dilemma between discomfort and what is expected of her, as a wife.<br />Edward struggles to decipher his new wife's emotions while trying to manage his growing irritation with her discomfort.<br />ON CHESIL BEACH is a true look at intimacy, and how a few short hours can change lives forever. McEwan navigates through uncomfortable scenes with ease, and creates a book that is a pleasure to read.<br />It's very odd that an author takes such an interesting approach to the marriage bed, where the consummation of a relationship is not sexy or romantic, but honestly awkward and clumsy. You'll definitely see McEwan's sympathy for Florence rise above any he has for Edward, but I felt mine going the same way as well.<br />However, he's not for everyone. The pace is relatively slow (the entire book covers only a few hours), and many people prone to reading fast-paced fiction will easily find themselves bored and toss the book aside. I really encourage you not to give up though! This book sat on my shelf for a year until I finally was able to pick it up and give it the time it deserved.<br />Ultimately, you'll find yourself sympathizing with both characters, investing in their story, and enjoying every moment of this ridiculously wonderful book. Just give it time.
0061537969|1.0|The dialogue was trite---he uses phrases such as \\"think outside the box\\"----if a novelist can't come up something more original and descriptive than that, then he's lost me immediately. The dialogue was also contrived---I found myself rolling my eyes at so much of it because it sounded so forced.    I couldn't have cared less about the characters; there wasn't enough development for me to care. The author spent WAY too much time including details that just didn't matter, as if he was trying to fill space. For example, I really didn't care that the daughter had \\"chips and the good cookies\\" in her lunch box. That was irrelevant----and annoying. In fact, much of the description of the daughter was annoying, as were much of the details of the racing scenes. They seemed contrived, and it was just too much; the author was obviously------and maybe that's the problem----that it was just too obvious---trying to use the racing scenes as metaphors for life. It didn't work for me; it was too forced.    The only reason that I didn't stop reading in the middle of the book and just donate it to charity was that I don't like starting something and then not finishing it. Was this book really a bestseller? I thought it was awful.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This is already a favorite! Susan Boyle delivers a lovely, heart-felt, never-disappointing rendition of beautiful songs. She sings with the feeling of someone who's experienced a lot in life and has overcome adversity. She deserves the success she's acheived. I love this one and look forward eagerly to her next release.
B001675YQ6|5.0|Whatever your taste in good movies, you will like at least some parts, if not all, of this movie.  Even if you find it hard to embrace this movie, you will find it even harder to dislike it.<br /><br />At the risk of being controversial, I will rate this movie above multi-threaded ensemble movies like \\"Love Actually\\", \\"Crash\\", \\"Valentine's Day\\" and \\"New York, I Love You\\".  The surprise is in a singular actress carrying the entire movie, supported by a cast of relatively unknown but competent actors.<br /><br />As I am writing this review, James Taylor is coming on \\"live\\" at the Oscar presentation (this is Oscar night, 7th March in the USA) with Brittany Murphy being remembered on screeen, and her image reprised at the end of Taylor's solo \\"In My Life\\".  We will never know if she would earn an Oscar one day, but from her performance in this movie, it is not possible to rule out her future potential.  I have watched \\"Ramen Girl\\", \\"Uptown Girls\\" and the Futurama with Brittany's voice, and I went on a binge of Brittany Murphy's movies like \\"Little Black Book\\" after I got the news that no more movies would be made by this great actress.  This movie was among the prominent ones recommended by Amazon when keying in the actress' name.  The movie surprises at many levels.<br /><br />From earlier reviews I gathered that the plot was going to less straightforward than \\"Ramen Girl\\" or \\"Uptown Girls\\".  Without going into the story line, I like this movie because:<br /><br />1.  The acting was serious, focused and well directed.  I cannot think of another actress who could have been better cast in the main role.  The British accents all round were from good character thespians.<br /><br />2.  The cinematography was good.  There were refreshing camera angles of contemporary London.  The Houses of Parliament framed by the London Eye (across the river) was one such unexpected view.<br /><br />3.  The colours were bright.  Like on picture post-cards.  The indoor shots were unusually bright and colourful.  No dim \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" artwork requiring Night Vision Goggles here.  Brittany Murphy's fully nude body in a kitchen scene(strategically covered by a copy of \\"The Naked Chef\\") was boldly illuminated.  Refreshing to see the details of English interior furnishing instead of the usual American home interiors.<br /><br />4.  For an adult movie, there was relatively little swearing.  Then there is a sensible plot. It is fun, but does not sit well as a chick-flick.  Nobody picks up a movie like this to feel depressed at the end.  Best watched together with close friend(s): beer/alcohol optional, not a necessity.  For morbid, pick up \\"Deadline\\" or \\"Dead Girl\\".<br /><br />Brittany Murphy does a good \\"damsel in distress\\" with pleading doe-like eyes, as in \\"Ramen Girl\\".  This appears be a recurring pattern in her movies.  Well, if you are good at something, keep doing it -  Denzel Washington does a good \\"Don't lie to me\\", Tom Hanks replayed \\"stupid\\" in \\"You've Got Mail\\" and Julia Roberts does a good petulant temper tantrum in \\"Pretty Woman\\", \\"Pelican Brief\\", \\"Erin Brockovich\\" and so on.  I thought that Brittany's waif-like begging was similarly getting to be one of her acting trade-marks.<br /><br />I am glad to have experienced this movie.irs of a Geisha\\" artwork requiring Night Vision Goggles here.

0316069906|5.0|Jonathan Safran Foer - the boy knows how to write! For serious! I'm sometimes skeptical when fiction authors I love wander into the realm of non-fiction, but with Foer's literary talent (Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close AND Everything Is Illuminated = pure brilliance!) and subject matter, I didn't hesitate for a second to pick up (and then devour) \\"Eating Animals.\\" I wasn't disappointed. Foer presented the truth of the horrors of the farming industry in the US (I don't even need to put factory beforehand, because I now know that factory farms are pretty much ALL there is) in such a way that is was actually ENJOYABLE to read. Sure, I was repulsed, I was disgusted, I had to stop several times to dry heave or to tell my boyfriend yet another horrifying fact, but it was still GOOD.<br /><br />Early on, Foer states that he didn't set out to write a book trying to convince people to go vegetarian. And I believe him. Because that's not what this book was about. It was about his quest for himself to see what meat was all about. And the fact is, the facts he found are all he needs to try to convince people to become vegetarian. He showed absolutely EVERY possible side of the story, including from interviews with ranching vegetarians and slaughterhouse workers to sections written by hardcore vegans and slaughterhouse owners and factory farm owners, etc. . . If there is another side to the story, I haven't found it - what Foer gives are the cold, hard facts. And the facts are so horrible that, no matter how you present them, it sounds like you're trying to convince. And what can I say, if you know the facts, you're probably wanting to convince people to go veggie.<br /><br />So even though he didn't \\"set out\\" to write a book trying to convince people to go vegetarian, this book tries to convince people to go vegetarian. Which is a GOOD THING! It makes the convincing all that much more real.<br /><br />Honestly, I am a vegan. And this book made me gladder than ever to be a vegan. At the same time, in a weird way, it makes me wish that I hadn't been a vegan beforehand and that the book had turned me. Because it would make my pleadings for you to go out and read it hold so much more weight. I want to go out and buy a copy for every single person I know and sit with them and make them read it. But then, I'm afraid. Because what if they didn't stop eating animals afterward? How could I respect them then?<br /><br />In the meantime, I can only hope that I remember all of the facts he has presented, and that, when discussing veganism, I find a way to present said facts in such a succint, interesting, knowledgable way as Foer has in this brilliant memoir. I can only hope that people will choose to stop living in denial and start learning the facts, even though they know that what they learn will be horrifying.in a weird way, it makes me wish that I hadn't been a vegan beforehand and that the book had turned me.

0439023483|5.0|I finished this book in 2.5 days (I'll add the half on because I read the last chapter on the third day). It was an amazing read, very fast-paced from the moment it started, all the way up until a cringe-worthy conclusion. Love or hate Katniss, she is a real character who serves as a good narrator, in part because she is so emotionally detached and dispassionate. It is no surprise to learn she is unable to process any potential romantic feelings she has towards the two lead males, given the environment she was raised in and rebels against in increasingly direct ways. Despite her desire for change, there is still the sense of home that leads to conflict as much as the romantic tension does.<br /><br />Although this book is intended for a teen audience, I am well past those years and still enjoyed it immensely. It is a book that can be enjoyed by all ages as it can be read on many levels. At the surface, it is an alternately scary and exciting adventure. However, underneath lies a commentary on the future of our society and political ramifications. I'm sort of glad I discovered this book late as the second book was already published and I flew through that as well. Now I'm anxiously awaiting book 3 in August.
B001GCUO5M|3.0|Martin Scorsese brought what he could to Shutter Island but something gets lost on the journey.    The acting is strong as ever, with under-rated Mark Ruffalo as a solid co-lead against Di Caprio's. Every character is filled with somebody especially adept in their roles at every turn from Ben Kingsly and Michelle Williams to Jackie Earle Haley. Max von Sydow rounds out the cast with chilling effect and Elias Koteas manages to steal one scene.     Production and costume design was top notch, with everything you would expect from a 1950s period piece.     The scenes that work are chilling and disturbing. Several flashback scenes and dream sequences are the strength of the movie, with images and subject matter that I'm sure Mr. Scorsese and the crew had trouble filming. While Martin has never strayed away from violence in past movies, the awful horrible things in this movie are far more provoking and deeply disturbing.    Unfortunately it never amps up the tension. The Departed was more taut which is a let down. The introduction to the island is ominous and brooding with a tense score, but for some reason I never felt any danger being on the island. Even as it seems like Di Caprio's world is falling apart most of the danger happens in his own mind, so you never venture to the edge of your seat. The editing could of been tightened up as well. The plot kinda clunks around with no real flow, going abruptly from one scene to the next.    (minor spoiler)  The biggest thing that kills the movie Di Caprio's character uncovers a conspiracy that never feels believable. The movie would have been far stronger if you could believe that his character's paranoid delusions could be real and he will never be able to uncover the truth and escape the island but its never credible. I never felt that it was possible for what he believed to be going on at the island to be true.  (end spoiler)    Leo's last line is the best part of the movie. It leaves what you have seen somewhat ambiguousof what his last action of the movie means. I can't explain more of that without completely spoiling the ending.    Overall, the movie could have been stronger. All the pieces were in place but something felt missing and it tumbles and fails to seriously impress. The parts that work give you chills, the parts that don't are because they feel too similar to other additions to the genre. It's all very unfortunate.
0439023491|5.0|A well-written follow-up to The Hunger Games. Just as exciting, if a little slower to get into. We find that, despite our hope from the ending of The Hunger Games, very little has changed for Katniss. She has new scenery, but the same problems. She no longer has the things she enjoyed, such as hunting in the woods with Gale, who has not quite forgiven her affection for Peeta. And she learns that all she feared is true: the Capital is angry with her and she must do the impossible and make it right.<br /><br />These books really are very good. They are engaging, exciting, and horrifying. The characters continue to be developed in manner consistent with the first book. I found myself physically reacting to deaths and unexpected funny events. I felt involved and I cannot wait until book 3 in August.
B000X107GI|2.0|my smart key still showing low battery even I tryed all new batteries I get.
0553381407|5.0|I would recommend this book for anyone.  It was very helpful to me.  I find that is does help me deal with my grown son also.  It is hard to let your children leave and make their own mistakes.  This helped me through a hard time in my life and with my own childhood.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Very good quality. I was a little disappointed because I seem to like the Discovery Channels remake of the information. They were very good programs and I guess I should have read a little more to see this was made by BBC instead of Discovery. Overall Very impressed and a beautiful show.
B0007Y08PQ|5.0|Great movie and my husband loves all this kind of movies.
B002YIHO7I|4.0|While hardly a departure from previous efforts, SOLDIER OF LOVE is a winner.  The enticing title track seems tailor-made for a 007 film, so hopefully the Bond people are listening...
B001KVZ6FW|3.0|Whoever feels that this is a children's movie is mistaken.  Subjects in the movie, like a husband and wife losing their baby during a pregnancy and the wife later dying, are far from what I would call kids' movie material.  My 11 year old is still crying.  Sorry I got it.
B00005QGAX|1.0|Peter Pan returned to Earth when this follow-up to THRILLER moved only about half as many copies. Jackson's audience would continue to dwindle with each subsequent release, perhaps owing as much to the Self-Proclaimed King of Pop's well-documented tangles with law enforcement as the quality of the albums themselves, yet Weird Al Yankovic nonetheless enjoyed tremendous success with his BAD-inspired music video, a rare example of a \\"cover\\" improving upon an original recording.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|Kate's performance is incredible.  Good story and great special effects.  Wish it lasted 10 hours.
B002VECM4K|5.0|It's rare that a movie matches its hype, but this one did.  The story is believable, real, and downright compelling.  The acting is incredible, especially that of Monique.  I cannot imagine how anyone can give this movie less than five stars.
B0026IBWYW|5.0|This is a superb book. It's well written and one of the best you can read.
B000FTZ4PC|4.0|I was really impressed by the condition of such an old edition of the Complete Sherlock Holmes (1920s I think). The binding and pages are nearly perfect. The only damage is to the dust flap cover, which was ripped and torn up along the spine. Regardless though, it was worth the cheap price!
1423101499|5.0|I had already loved the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, and this forth installment just makes make love it even more!    It is once again filled with Riordan's fabulous writing. It amazes me in every book in this series how well he captures the voice of a young teen boy. Percy is such a lovable character. His sense of humor always gets me on his side everytime. In this installment we see our favorite heroes going on a quest inside the labyrinth, an underground maze that is never as it seems. The quest is lead by Annabeth this time. Annabeth had some hard decisions to make. She really had to grow up alot in this book, all the characters did really. Grover continues on his quest for the lost god Pan. I  really enjoyed having Tyson back. Him and Percy are great together. I was pleasantly surprised to see Rachel back. I love how Riordan ties each story together and how each character he adds has a purpose. I have to say my favorite part of this one was watching Nico's character development. I am such a sucker for the angsty characters.      I thought the Titan's Curse was action packed, but this one far out did it. Every chapter held an exciting scene that made it impossible to not jump into the next one. We meet some new gods and some new seriously freaky monsters on this journey. I have to admit that I teared up at a few parts, especially in the ending. Alot of the suspense is over at the end, but you are still left with some cliffhangers. Some of the outcomes were easy for me to decipher, but some of them seriously shocked me. I almost don't want to read the next book in the series because it is the last. I just  don't want to let these characters go yet! I want to say so much more, but I would just be giving away spoilers if I did. Percy Jackson and the Olympians continues to be one of my favorite series. If you haven't started this series yet, do so ASAP!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|there is nothing better than this series.  I love watching the amazing beauty of our planet in a way that has never been seen before.  This is worth twice what you play for.
031606792X|5.0|I was hesitant to read this series because of it's popularity and didn't think that there was much to it.  However, after seeing New Moon in theaters it peaked my interest and I wanted more information, which is why I started reading the second book.  Although I had thought that Bella was a fairly weak character, by the end of Breaking Dawn my perception was changed and I realized that she is actually quite strong emotionally.  I am definitely glad that I read this series.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This film is one of the most interesting ones I've seen on food production in the US.  There are so many complex issues this film covered.  It really changes how I look at food.  I showed it to my high school students and they were so interested.  I think everyone in the US should see it.
B00275EGX8|1.0|I will start with something positive.  Catherine Bigelow is stunning.  But the film?  So far The Iraq War has not translated well into compelling fictional accounts on television or on film and this is no exception.  I will cut right to the chase.  This film is boring.  You are basically going from one IED deactivation to the next, kind of wondering the whole time why they don't just blow them up to avoid the risk to the bomb squad.  I tried to like this, I fell for the hype before seeing it, but ultimately I didn't care enough to even finish watching it and I wanted my $3.99 back from Comcast.
0743277708|5.0|At first I was hesitant to read a book with all animal characters but my girlfriend really recommended it to me, so I began.  I'm a firm believer in writing style and authors mattering more than the story itself.  I'm not saying the story is bad - because it's a very good one - but the author's creativity and writing style are what I loved about this book.  This is a very fun book to read and it's far more exciting than I expected a book of it's nature to be.  I highly recommend for all ages - especially adults since it seems like it may be perceived as a book for the youth.
B0002WS3RS|5.0|As I wrote in my review of the Japanese remaster of \\"Flying Teapot\\", for those who have no idea what the band is about, it is a hippy/new age story with a great deal of Australian whimsey, set to a sound that is definitely psychedelic, but with true musical ability - which really starts to shine on this album, and culminates on the last part of the \\"Radio Gnome\\" trilogy, \\"You\\".    The remaster is excellent - while the age of the recording allows a bit of background tape hiss to be audible at the very soft beginning of the first track, that is a minor point. The sound is very clear and crisp - really better than I expected from a recording of this era.    As for the music, here we find the focus shifting from the Daevid Allen-dominated quirkiness of \\"Flying Teapot\\" and the earlier Gong albums to progressive space-rock with a jazz tinge. Guitarist Steve Hillage begins to step forward as the player and writer who would so greatly influence an entire generation of neo-psych bands from Ozric Tentacles to Porcupine Tree (their early work, not the more metal sound of the last several albums) and countless others. Tim Blake's synthesizers bubble and phase with an effectiveness that the German artists of the era (e.g. Klaus Schulze, Tangerine Dream) only wish they could accomplish. But it's the sax and flute of Didier Malherbe that really make the sound unique, adding the afore-mentioned jazzish tone and sensibility (with some help from drummer Pierre Moerlen and percussionist Mirielle Bauer). Allen and poetess/space whisperer Gilli Smyth still add their indiosyncratic words and sounds (and whatever one thinks of Allen's ditties, his glissando guitar is simply the best space instrument ever), but no longer overwhelm the creativity of the rest of the band.    I still rate this the second best of the Gong albums - \\"You\\" to me is where they reached their peak, and so to \\"make room\\" as it were for that truly 5-star album, I really would probably give this four and a half stars.Some might find the whimsical bits still a bit distracting. But where this album hits its peak (the space/rock/jazz of the opening \\"Other Side of the Sky\\", the poignancy of emotional lyrical duality and French cafe sound of \\"Prostitute Poem\\", the infectious Malherbe-dominated pop-with-a-brain-and-soul of \\"Oily Way\\", the perfect mixture of hippy dream lyrics and jazz marimba of \\"Love Is How You Make It\\", the soaring Hillage guitar that hints of things to come of \\"I Never Glid Before\\", and the rollicking Malherbe coda \\"Eat That Phone Book\\") there is a freshness and vision that sets it apart from anything else in the psychedelic music (in the general sense) universe. Highly recommended.
1401219268|5.0|Alan Moore's masterpiece The Watchmen should have a spot on every comic aficionado's bookshelf. It has been hailed as the graphic novel that started a revolution in comics, and I like to agree with that sentiment. I was not around when it first came out, and I only just got to reading it, but I can see why it still stands as a solid piece of work thirty years after it ended. The Watchmen is indeed a classic!<br />Where to begin? Well, let us start with the lesser of its achievements, the art. The line work is crisp and clean, the anatomy realistic, and its action scenes flow like poetry (to say the least). The character designs were set in the early eighties, so they are a bit dated, yet for the most part you feel you could meet these people in your very own city. For me, my favorite thing was the use of color - each scene oozes atmosphere, and you can tell thought and effort was put into the coloring of each panel. All and all, it is superb.<br />What really makes this different from pretty pictures, and truly a graphic novel, is Moore's writing. The man is a genius. He took something that, for years, had been dumbed down for children's consumption, and made it for adults.  After The Watchmen debuted, no one could say that superhero comics were kid's realms. It was truly what the stale comics scene needed at the time. It changed the scene - leaving a standard writers and artists continue living up to today.<br />Moore's first big achievement in The Watchmen is setting up a realistic and consistent world. Not only did he use the comic to do this, but between each chapter he would add textual tidbits - such as newspaper clippings from the story's world - to further expand the alternate reality. It draws you in, and upon a second reading makes you go \\"Oh! Now I see what he did there.\\" Each line, each piece of dialogue, every panel is meant to further along the plot, faster and faster on to the final conclusion.<br />Then there is the recurring symbolism and motifs, something you don't really see anymore in any medium. The story makes continuous references: patterns stitch together where there once was nothing, subtly reminding the reader of what they are reading. Much of it is used to the effect of social commentary; some is there to bring a sense of unease; all of it is perfectly placed and never overused. Almost all of it is in the art, making another perfect example of why the graphic novel is such a powerful medium.<br />The most important thing, besides the groundbreaking plot, is The Watchmen's characters. Each and every one seems meticulously plotted out, their psychology slowly peeled open throughout the course of the book like a rare flower. Each character serves a purpose - each has their own motives, desires, and fears. They are memorable in their humanity. In real life, you do not see the ending before its due time, and The Watchmen reflects that. Until the final chapters we are left only guessing as to what great and terrible thing will happen to our heroes.<br />At the end, it will leave you asking - \\"Who watches the watchmen?\\"mething you don't really see anymore in any medium.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|What can I say?, beyond the title of my  review, for one side, this movie is just great, good perfomances, great special effects, solid plot (yes even if Kirk goes from cadet to captain in on hour, that kind of things happens in war) but in the other hand, JJ Abrams, has literally, destroyed 40 years of cannon (in the real universe) and 200 years of Star Trek universe, so, I only hope that the next movie will be number as it follows , Star Trek XII, and the things return to the right temporal line!!!!!!!
B00275EGWY|5.0|Every year there comes a little film that blows audience and critic alike out of their seat.  These movies are often unheard of until a viewer sees the first theatrical trailer, or is told by a friend that they should give it a try.<br /><br />For 2009 that little film was the Iraq set military drama entitled `The Hurt Locker' directed by Kathryn Bigelow (ex-spouse of the infamously hard-headed, yet incredibly profitable special effects director, James Cameron who this same year broke his own record set by Titanic in 1997 with his 3D eye candy Avatar).  This film about a SSG William James (marvelously portrayed by Jeremy Renner) is a war film unlike any to be made before it.<br /><br />Sergeant First Class William James is out of place in Iraq.  He is a rebel in a system that requires precision as well as cooperation.  Perceived as a lone wolf with a death wish James suits up each day and constantly berates the advice and orders of those around him.  For William James this isn't a job: it's his life.  He doesn't fear dying in a ball of flame because that's what gets him off.  James has developed a truly unique addiction as his squad mates soon discover.<br /><br />William James is addicted to adrenaline; the thrill of knowing that at any moment he could be scattered in a thousand different places.<br /><br />Naturally this film contains multiple teeth chattering moments involving bomb diffusion, but I'm actually hesitant to call this masterpiece a \\"war film\\" because war surprisingly has little to do with the plot of the film.  Never once does this film decide to preach about moral of troops, brotherhood amongst soldiers, or even the politics behind the controversial war in Iraq.  `The Hurt Locker' is 100% self-contained and finely focused on its protagonist with Iraq being treated as the backdrop; no more, no less.  In my opinion a \\"war film\\" will focus on those issues, but The Hurt Locker doesn't even seem to acknowledge those archetypes.<br /><br />Bigelow directs the film in a manner that only a woman could possibly manage.  Gritty and dark, yet on the same time lapsing into what is clearly fiction The Hurt Locker is a delicate ballet of a constantly changing perspective.  While at times it strives for realism at others it will lapse into action movie style themes...but this is in no way a flaw with this movie.  The way I see this is that William James is an addict to adrenaline and the army is his dealer.  What the audience sees is war from the addict's point of view which of course makes war out almost as if it were a fantasy for James...except for the occasionally lapses in his addiction when he is forced to face the reality of his situation.<br /><br />Needless to say, this talented woman has come a LONG way since working with Keeanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze in Point Break.<br /><br />The pacing of The Hurt Locker is almost like the beating of a heart, which meshes well with the nerve rattling subject matter.  Bigelow pulls every string to make the style of this film mix with its subject material while at the same time allowing it to become an enjoyable action peace with some of the most suspenseful scenes in the history of cinema.<br /><br />Already many people are complaining about the realism of this movie; choosing to compare it to films such as `Black Hawk Down', `Saving Private Ryan', and even `Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket'.  Not surprisingly the people who try comparing The Hurt Locker to these Grade-A war films is like comparing apples to...watermelons.  It is absurd to compare The Hurt Locker to actual war films because The Hurt Locker belongs in an entirely separate genre.<br /><br />While those films are directly relating to war (politics, whether war is good or bad, brotherhood of soldiers, etc...) The Hurt Locker is a character study solely focused on a single individual who suffers from an addiction.  The fact that he's a U.S. Soldier serving in Iraq is irrelevant to the heart of this film.<br /><br />Face it folks, we won't see a war film that analyzes the nature of the Iraq war until U.S. troops have entirely pulled out because until then it's too hard to look over all the facts because things are still happening.  Don't come in looking for the `Apocalypse Now' of Iraq films because you'll not find anything like it until the conflict has been resolved and we've had a few years to recollect on its events.<br /><br />As it stands, The Hurt Locker is without a doubt the best film of 2009 with an amazing performance from Jeremy Renner and expert direction by Kathryn Bigelow.  I feel that people may not understand it now, but much like Apocalypse Now, or any of Stanley Kubrick's films I believe that this will be a film that the public shall look back on as being something unforgettable.<br /><br />Thankfully the Academy managed to see The Hurt Locker's value upon release instead of making a decision they would have regretted ten years from now.e nature of the Iraq war until U.S. troops have entirely pulled out because until then it's too hard to look over all the facts because things are still happening.

0385528752|5.0|This book provides good insights on making changes. It can be a change at a personal level or a Leader who wants to make a change in his organization. Following is the summary and key points of the book.    An analogy of a Rider and an Elephant is used in this book. Rider is the logical part and our thinking which drives us. Elephant is our emotion. To make a change, you need to appeal to both the Rider and the Elephant. If you appeal only to Rider, your team will have understanding without motivation. If you appeal to Elephant you will have passion without direction.    It is easy to turn an easy change problem into a hard change problem. If you want somebody to eat less, serve them in a smaller plate instead of worrying about convincing or educating them.    What looks like a people problem is often a situation problem. When you shape the path you make change more likely. To change behavior, direct the Rider, motivate the Elephant and shape the path.    If you are trying to change things, there will be bright spots. Understanding the bright spots will help in knowing what needs to be done differently. Ask \\"What's working and how we can do more of it?\\". In the real word this obvious question is rarely asked. Instead the question we ask is, \\"what's broken , and how do we fix it ?\\".    Big problems are rarely solved with big solutions. Instead they are often solved by a sequence of small steps over weeks, sometimes over decades.    Leaders pride themselves in setting high level direction. Big picture and hands off Leadership doesn't work in a change situation because the hardest part of change is in the details. When you want someone to behave in a new way, explain the new way clearly.    Goals in most organizations lack emotional resonance. Instead SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Timely) have become norm. SMART goals are better for steady state situation and not for change situation.    Analytical tools work when parameters are known, assumptions are minimal and future is not fuzzy. Big change situation is not like that. Parameters aren't well understood and the future is fuzzy, Elephant is reluctant to move and analytical arguments will not overcome reluctance.    We are frequently blind to the power of situations. When someone behind the wheel of a car is twenty minutes late for crucial appointment that person becomes a terrible driver. What looks like a person problem is often a situation problem.    Behavior autopilot allows lot of good behavior to happen without the Rider taking charge. Habits are behavioral autopilot and that is why they are critical for Leaders. Leaders who can instill habits reinforce their team goals.    A good change leader never thinks, \\"Why are these people acting badly?\\". A change Leader thinks, \\" How can I setup a situation that brings about good in people \\".

B002UNMW7O|2.0|Maybe it's just me but this movie felt like a cheap, recycled version of the first. I'm astounded by how many people feel this is just as good if not better than the first movie. It makes me wonder if a lot of today's fans of the movie actually got why the first was so great. This sequel had a couple interesting things going for it like the ending and our new fbi liason is pretty entertaining and easy on the eyes. Aside from that, you aren't getting anything new, original, etc that wasn't already done in the first and done well. To say the least, I was pretty disappointed which sucks because I had high hopes.
B0017M8XS6|1.0|The only reason to buy this packaging over previous versions is the SACD disc, so this review concerns only that disc.    This is quite possibly the worst SACD engineering effort ever. If there's a worse one, I certainly don't want to hear it. After the opening song I was switching with known discs to make sure my system was not broken. After the second song I moved to another system to ensure there weren't compatibility issues with that player.    The mid range is highly boosted in most places, the bass is nearly nonexistent, the high frequencies come and go within songs, but mostly from the rear channels, rarely from the front. Lake's vocals disappear into the background as if he's singing from a pub next door, only to come out full force from nowhere, then retreat again. The volume of the rear channels is jacked way up relative to the front. Instruments switch channels at apparently random times, creating an experience like a Quadrophonic demo LP. Rather than feeling like you're in the middle of the studio, you feel as if you are listening to a child with a panning joystick. Given the imbalance in equalization and volume, this effect is particularly grating, as within a single passage an instrument will jump from a boosted channel with full high end to a softer one with compressed highs then back again. Even the liner notes are a mess, with \\"Manticore\\" sometimes spelled \\"Manicure,\\" and incorrect references to the musicians' respective backgrounds.    If you want the CD, buy another edition. This set is not worth having at any price, let alone a high one.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|I must have watched this movie at least a dozen times in a row and still can't get enough. Every time I see Nicole Kidman in an interview, on tv, or in a movie I think of this film and then pop it into my dvd player. Personally I think it is her best film to date and will always love it. The characters in this film are so intense and realistically portrayed it's impossible not to get drawn into the movie yourself from start to finish. Love this film and I highly recommend it!
B001DSNEJM|4.0|In Dallas, Texas, the family man Ben Garvey is on probation but he is a hard worker of the Fort Garry Brewery Company and lives a simple life with his beloved wife Lisa and their daughter Katie. When his probation period finishes, Ben's brother Rick visits him after being released from prison and invites Ben to heist 12 kg of gold in dust from a laboratory. Ben refuses the invitation but he is fired from his job because of his record; he decides to join Ricky and his partner Phelps in the robbery. However things go wrong and Ricky, Phelps and a security guard die in the heist and Ben is sentenced to death for the murders. After his execution through lethal injection, Ben awakes working as housekeeper of the Monte Angel community in Dundee, Oregon, for Father Ezra, who explains to him that his past life is gone and now he is having a second chance. However he should never cross the boundaries of the location, otherwise he would die. Ben feels confused with the weird situation but he can not forget Lisa and Katie and forces Ezra to give a plausible explanation to him. But while working in the garden, Ben finds a frisby on the grass; he investigates and discloses the secret of the facility. A psychological thriller that will make you think from the the beginning to the end. Although a bit slow in the first parts to the middle, thats why its a psychological thriller, the climax to the end compensated for it. The lines are well delivered, a good script, good acting all in all, a good movie.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|The fourth volume of Martin's epic fantasy series, A Feast for Crows, falls flat for many of the series' light readers because they are not aware of what happened. AffC is only half a book, and one that did not fit into Martin's scheme. Originally, Martin planned this book to start five years after A Storm of Swords, but felt it relied much too much on flashbacks and scrapped it. In return, he started with A Dance with Dragons. While getting into the book, Martin reached over 1000 pages and it was only half completed. To remedy this, Martin was forced to split the book into two halves--A Feast for Crows, and A Dance with Dragons, which divides the characters by location, rather than only telling half a story per book. That is, AffC contains characters in the south of Westeros--Jaime, Cersie, Brienne, and a few characters from the north, that area headed south, such as Samwell, and some characters that with only a few chapters, such as Arya and Sansa.    This means that A Dance with Dragons, which will run simultaneously with this book, contains the other ensemble of characters--which are the more beloved of them all. Jon, Tyrion, Dany, Arya again, and some others.    This book isn't terrible, but it does lack in action. For the faithful readers, though, you know that not everything can be great. But it does have plenty of suspense--half of the main characters in this book end in cliffhangers that won't be answered until the latter half of ADwD.    The war may be mostly over, but the survivors still have their lives on the line.
0767802519|5.0|Mathilda, a twelve-year old New York girl, is living an undesirable life among her half-family. Her father stores drugs for two-faced cop Norman Stansfield. Only her little brother keeps Mathilda from breaking apart. One day, Stansfield and his team take cruel revenge on her father for stretching the drugs a little, thus killing the whole family. Only Mathilda, who was out shopping, survives by finding shelter in L&eacute;on's apartment in the moment of highest need. Soon, she finds out about the strange neighbour's unusual profession, killing and desperately seeks his help in taking revenge for her little brother. L&eacute;on, who is completely unexperienced in fatherly tasks, and in friendships, does his best to keep Mathilda out of trouble unsuccessfully. Now, the conflict between a killer, who slowly discovers his abilities to live, to feel, to love and a corrupt police officer, who does anything in his might to get rid of an eye witness, arises to unmeasurable proportions - all for the sake of a little twelve-year old girl, who has nearly nothing to lose. Luc Besson's movie L&eacute;on \\"The Professional\\" gives a intense story which is maximized in potential by the casting of the movie done by Todd Thaler. Every aspect of the movie delivers and makes an impressive overall package.  A gripping story with well-crafted characters.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|I saw this movie many moons ago when I was in grade school.  I thought it was a magical, entertaining story.  I bought it for my 2 and 3 year old as something I thought they'd enjoy when they got to grade school.  I was surprised to see them riveted to it for most of the program.  I was doubly surprised they wanted to watch it over and over again!  I'm pretty sure it was the singing and dancing that held their attention.  This is definitely a classic that even little ones will enjoy now!
B0026P3G12|4.0|The mini-dustup over Elaine Paige's  \\"virus\\" remarks about Susan Boyle (supposedly taken out of context--but what's the CONTEXT??) are no doubt reflective of what a lot of show biz types feel deep down about \\"overnight sensations\\" like Susan.  What for most people is an inspiring story about dreaming a dream is--at least for some--another troublesome of case of someone rising to the top without ever having paid any real dues.    There's another way to view it, though.  There are all KINDS of dues.  Yes, there are the trials and tribulations and very real SACRIFICES that people who devote themselves to their art have to go through for years on end, with no guarantee of any recognition or reward in the end.  That's very real.  But from what we know about Susan Boyle's life (or other \\"ugly duckling\\" late-in-life discoveries like Paul Potts), we have to acknowledge that there were crushing psychic blows, bitter disappointments and many, many hurdles to overcome, some musical, of course, but mainly we're talking personal demons here. And painful life circumstances.    Even though it's not Susan's preferred musical genre, those of us who are more steeped in rock'n'roll know something about the DYI ethic.  Inspired amateurs sometimes give the lie to the long cherished (in some corners) notion that there is a huge gulf between the talented beginner and the true artiste.  It doesn't detract from the achievements of the Elaine Pages of the world to say that late bloomers like Susan Boyle have their place too.      Having said all that, I'm somewhat disappointed in Susan's debut.  I'm not sure what I expected in terms of arrangements and song selection, but it probably wasn't much different from what we actually ended up with. I'm impressed that she or Simon or someone in management dug up a classic Stones ballad, to say nothing of a somewhat well-known Patty Griffin tune that really does deserve a broader audience. However, one very positive thing she seemed to bring to the table--at least in her TV performances--was a robust, mature delivery and a voice that was certainly sweet enough, but richer than those of the current crop of ingenues (the ones who can actually SING, I mean).    But nearly every vocal on this record sounds \\"sweetened\\" to my untrained ears.  The emotion that she demonstrated on BRITAIN'S GOT TALENT seems needlessly reined in.  (I say \\"needlessly\\" since she really was not a singer prone to overkill to begin with).  It sounds as if her producers set out to make her sound like a 20 year old, not a woman closing in on 50.  The breathy voice employed on \\"Wild Horses\\" may demonstrate \\"another side\\" of Susan Boyle, but unfortunately, it's a little too anonymous.  YouTube faves \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\" and \\"Cry Me A River\\" fare better, but the former is more reined in than it needs to be.  I'm not so sure that in Ms. Boyle's case, less really IS more.  The cabaret style of \\"Cry...\\" is quite elegant, however, and the less-is-more vocal works well here.      \\"How Great Thou Art\\" has Susan channeling Enya, which is probably better than trying to evoke Mahalia, say (let the choir do that).  The fact that some of the tunes, while certainly pleasant, are not all that vocally demanding (\\"Daydream Believer\\" and \\"You'll See\\"), adds to the subdued mood.  She certainly gives Madonna a run for her money on \\"You'll See,\\" and I'm sure the tune has a somewhat different meaning for her than for its composer.  In her personal commentary to \\"Daydream Believer,\\" Susan cites the altered lyrics \\"the hours of yesterday don't mean a thing\\" as being personally significant.  I don't think there'd be anything wrong, necessarily, with a female singer singing original \\"the shaving razor's cold and it stings,\\" since women shave too, but to each her own.  The conversion of \\"Sleepy Gene\\" into \\"Sleepy Jean\\" in this version is more or less complete, but why is the narrator still \\"a white knight on a steed\\" still?  Maybe it's a Joan of Arc thing.    Patty Griffin's \\"Up To The Mountain\\" was written as a tribute to Martin Luther King, and while it would have been nice to have that acknowledged, the version here is nonetheless a credible one.  Here the restraint works--as it did in Griffin's original.  \\"Amazing Grace\\" gets gospelly, but again that's the chorus's shtick.  Susan stays on a more ethereal plain throughout the song. That's a valid interpretation, but you gotta wonder if Susan wasn't a little jealous of the way her back up gets to cut loose a little.      It's been pointed out that every song has some personal meaning for Susan, and her own liner notes clue you in as to what that is.  For the old chestnut, \\"End of the World,\\" she's careful to say that that's NOT true, \\"it's only just beginning.\\"  We know that, Susan. It's just a song, after all.  But the relatively bleak lyrics give her vocal a little more edge than we encounter elsewhere.  Sorta like how on the televised versions of \\"I Dreamed A Dreamed,\\" she pulled out the stops on \\"this hell I'm living\\" line.  She doesn't do that on the recorded version.  And I kinda miss it.
B00003CWRX|5.0|Thid id s terrific movie and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  My credentials for rating a movie are purely subjective:  I like what I like and find most professional movie reviewers are off the mark most of the time.  Based on how I liked the movie I offer the following:    The story line is fascinating.  There aren't too many two and one half hour movies I can say this about.  I have no illusions about the morality of big business whether it is news media, tobacco, or government:  the main unction of each is money.  This is a movie that satisfies the heart of someone who thiks like me.  More important it is fun to watch, and that is my purose in watching movies!    The acting is superb.  No movie, no matter its social benefit, is any good without good acting and writing.    The movie has a major flaw:  too many scenes are filmed in darkness.  The characters are back lighted and hard to distinquish.  It may add to the artistic value of the film, but it detracts from the enjoyment.    The main thrust of the story from my perspective is to show the corporate bias toward wealth at the risk of the public's health both physically and intellectually.  Big industry does not come off well in this film nor does mass media.    Despite what I consider the technical flaws of the film, I heartily recommend this to my friends.  If you are interested in collecting worthwhile films this should be toward the top of your list.
B001GM28HO|5.0|Good cd Makes you want to get up and move around. This is one cd that you can't stay sitting down, but you have to get up and move with this cd.
B002XMGGK6|3.0|It was an ok movie overall if you are not squeamish and suspend your disbelief....But still:      Who signs off on a plan to pick up a napalm bomb, drive it across town, sneak it under this man's bed, and then offer him the opportunity to blow it up, taking an entire prison wing with it?!  A first-grader would have taken the bomb to an empty field.  Considering they had found his hidden exit and weapon's cache, the man was neutralized as a threat.  That ending made no sense whatsoever.

For anyone that takes the time to write a long critical review......get a life. OR better yet, see if you can write a better book than Dan Brown and then you'll have room to talk.
B00082IJ08|1.0|After listening to the much, much, much, MUCH hyped Gorillaz, I have to say that they are unquestionably one of the most overrated \\"bands\\" of all time. Damon Albarn was NOT Blur, by the way. That band was made up of FOUR very competent (and contributing!) musicians. And the whole idea of a cartoon band is about as original as the Archies (who were better).    They've got a new CD coming out this month. Warn me if it's being played.
B002GIBVV6|5.0|This movie is my absolute all-time favorite movie! I first saw it in the theater as a 16 year old and here I am in my 30's now and have watched it countless times. The music is beautiful, the casting is spot-on, and everything about this movie is perfectly perfect.<br /><br />The movie does deviate slightly from the book (most notably in the deaths of Mary's parents), but I was not bothered in the least by the changes. I adore Kate Mabry as Mary and only wish she would appear in more films. I was pleased to see her play a small role in \\"Finding Neverland\\" but haven't seen her since. Andrew Knott as Dickon was also very good.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this movie to young and old alike! An enchanting story of love, friendship, and healing set in a beautiful setting, what's not to like?!
B002T9H2L0|1.0|Disappointing for a Tarantino film. Do not know how much the film cost, but it was a big waste of talent and resources. It seems he wanted to explore other type of stories and stamp his seal, but nothing new here that we have not seen in one of his previous films. The basement bar dialogues are so long that at one point become boring. The movie was well filmed and visually is impecable, but the plot did not flow naturally as other films that simultaneously tell three or more stories melting in the end. Tarantino must do better research before he gets involved in a project that is not pure gore or under-world-related story, in THAT he is master. Regrettably to hear Cat People from David Bowie (which BTW was previously used in an 80's film) in a 2010 soundtrack for a WWII film, it just do not fit.
1416550550|5.0|Many others have done a great job of summarizing this book, so I won't write a synopsis. I will say this ranks as one of the very best books I've ever read. I enjoyed it so much I've read it three times and loved it even more with each read.<br /><br />I adored Frances Hodgson Burnett's classic \\"The Secret Garden\\" as a child, and this book is a clever re-imagining from an adult perspective. Ms. Burnett even makes a cameo appearance!<br /><br />The first couple of times I picked this up I failed to \\"get into it\\"...the length alone was daunting. But my mother was persistently persuasive for me to keep at it, and I'm so glad she was! About a 1/4 of the way through the book I simply couldn't put it down, and spent many nights reading way later than I should have!<br /><br />The characters in this story have stayed with me and I often find myself thinking about them. This story is simply haunting! Ms. Morton has a beautiful way of writing, and I am eagerly anticipating her next project. I have recommended this book to everyone I know who enjoys a wonderful story. You will not be disappointed!
B001OQCV2O|2.0|that's about it.  The story is predictable and fairly generic. Not much to say about this flick except it's interesting that the only people saved are politicians and folks who can afford to pay.  In any case, I'll give it 2 stars for the effects.
B00275EGWY|4.0|This wasn't my favorite movie of the year, but I did enjoy it on its own terms: as a taut, suspenseful action thriller with a level of psychological insight that was at least a little deeper than most movies of this genre.    What bothers me is the amount of vitriol leveled at this film by actual soldiers who served in Iraq.  A movie's primary job is to entertain.  Inevitably a few--or perhaps many--actual facts are omitted, fabricated, bent, or altered for the sake of a compelling narrative that should at least convey an emotional truth about the very human characters they represent.  I believe this film achieves the \\"emotional truth\\" part at the expense of the facts.  I'm fine with that, especially if you consider the following:    Bigelow and her crew made several requests to the U.S. military for assistance and consultation and were repeatedly and categorically refused on each occasion.  Given this lack of access and the budget limitations, Bigelow was forced to sacrifice some accuracy in regard to the soldiers' equipment and, perhaps most glaringly, in the implausibly small number of men on the EOD unit.    Ironically, the U.S. military DOES frequently lend assistance and consultation to bigger budget--and more blatantly untrue--escapist popcorn movies like G.I. Joe or Transformers.    I have a couple of soldier friends who loved the Transformers movies and hated The Hurt Locker.  I can only shake my head.  I have the utmost respect for their service, but not for the type of cognitive dissonance they exhibit in (some of) their movie preferences.

B0006OBPTA|5.0|I bought the box set because my son is studying karate.  We watched one each night for four nights and enjoyed all of them.
B001HN694K|3.0|For me, Tim Burton has always been more miss than hit.  For every excellent effort (ED WOOD, SWEENEY TODD) there seem to be several misfires (SLEEPY HOLLOW, CORPSE BRIDE, BIG FISH.)  Unfortunately, ALICE IN WONDERLAND is mostly a miss for me.  I looked very much forward to his twisted vision, as the ALICE books were insane mash-ups of verbal nonsense and visual oddness (thanks to the classic illustrations from Teniel.)    Burton's film is full of some stunning visuals, most bearing no resemblance to the illustrations...but I'm okay with that.  Burton and his collaborators have re-imagined the look for Wonderland, and that's actually a perfectly valid approach.  Plenty of other ALICE films have tried to hew more closely to the look of the original books.  But what I didn't like was the story Burton chose to tell.    ALICE IN WONDERLAND and THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS are very difficult to handle cinematically, because they don't really tell a cohesive story.  Yes, there is the barest filament of a plot...but it's mostly a string of incidents as Alice meets weird creatures who tell strange and often nonsensical stories.  (There's a reason Jefferson Airplane wrote the song \\"White Rabbit.\\")  So I can understand that Burton and crew wanted to force a real plot for all these familiar characters to enact.  However, I think Burton made two mistakes that resulted in one big problem.    Mistake #1 was to set the story later in the life of Alice, so that she's a young lady on the verge of being engaged to a man very much not right for her...instead of a young girl.  It makes sense that a young girl could observe the insanity of wonderland and accept it all.  Rabbits that talk?  Sure, no problem.  A giant caterpillar smoking a hookah?  Yep.  Living playing cards?  Fun!  But as a 19 year old young lady, who is clearly intelligent...wouldn't you at least expect some raised eyebrows?  Granted, the Alice we meet is a curious & imaginative person...but she still seems to have little trouble drinking one potion to shrink and nibbling on something else to grow without giving it a thought.    Mistake #2 was to focus on the politics of Wonderland (actually, in this film, it is called Underland, sadly).  We get this story of the evil Red Queen and the virtuous White Queen, and how their animosity has affected the citizens of the land.  The poor creatures are suffering under the yolk of the bad queen.  It smelled just a little too much like Narnia to me (without the religious overtones).      The net effect of these two mistakes was to sap the film of any real sense of wonder.  I ADMIRED much of the visual look:  Tweedledum & Tweedledee were suitably creepy/funny.  The life-size playing cards / soldiers were well-rendered.  Helena Bonham Carter was a visual marvel as the Red Queen.  But I wasn't swept away.  I didn't feel transported to a new world, I felt invited to a viewing of a really cool set and some nifty CGI.  Wonderland didn't feel REAL, and the story didn't feel compelling.    Mia Wasikowska made for a very striking Alice.  Even though I disagreed with making her a \\"grown up,\\" I can't fault the actress for that.  She plays her underwritten, one-dimensional role as well as possible.  (I'll say right now that one of Burton's biggest flaws, to me, is that he seldom creates well-rounded characters...usually just a collection of traits.  Some actors can wrangle those quirks and ticks into a believable person...others cannot.)  I enjoyed Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen...again, she was seldom asked to do much, but she tore into her role with relish.  A lot of the voice work was very good as well:  Alan Rickman is perfect for the Caterpillar and I always like Stephen Fry (Cheshire Cat.)      Less successful were Crispin Glover as Stayne, the Knave of Hearts.  If ever a character needed to be unhinged, it's Stayne...and usually Glover can deliver unhinged with the best of them.  But he mostly came across as stoic.  Anne Hathaway was bland.  And most disappointing was the usually reliable Johnny Depp.  I'm used to him being the best thing in any Burton movie.  He was flat-out brilliant as Ed Wood, full of wonder as Scissorhands and deliciously villainous as Sweeney.  Yet as the Mad-Hatter, he's all over the map.  Burton has tried to take a minor character from the original books, and stretch him into being the conscious of Wonderland...the IDEA of Depp as the Hatter was great, but reinventing the character just to give your star more to do was a mistake.  He's amusing to look at for a few minutes...but his accent jumps around (and worse, he's often unintelligible in his mumblings) and he appears to have a rather odd fixation on Alice.  Is he \\"in love\\" with the lovely young woman he sees now, or is he \\"in love\\" with his memory of the 10 year old girl he once met...which is highly creepy, but seems to be the case.    ALICE IN WONDERLAND is a huge disappointment.  Burton is an awkward storyteller but a visual genius.  This time, however, even those skills are found wanting.

B0010LB4G2|4.0|If you suffer from anxiety or a deep fear, you are not alone; this is a part of the human condition. But we don't have to suffer endlessly because anxiety has an internal structure in the form of negative thoughts and beliefs powered by emotional energy that has become frozen in place. Uncover these patterns of negative thoughts and you are on the way to making significant change. As a mindfulness-based psychotherapist, I use mindfulness as the primary tool for doing just this, and I would recommend anyone to learn more about the therapeutic use of mindfulness in conjunction with good self-analysis. I also recommend 'The Path of Mindfulness Meditation' by Dr Peter Strong, an in-depth exploration of mindfulness meditation.

B002YIHO7I|5.0|Sade fans rejoice. The wait is over...and it was worth it. Once again Sade has blessed us with her silky voice and her soulful grooves. I was lucky, not to mention honored, to see her perform Soldier Of Love on Jimmie Kimmel. What the television viewing audience saw was a goddess. Pure perfection. What they did not see was a truly classy woman. When they brought her out onstage, those of us in the studio audience simply erupted. I have never seen a smile so big as the one she gave all of us there. Sade exudes class without coming off as a diva. The Moon And The Sky is classic Sade. The militaristic determination of Soldier Of Love resonates with experience. It's the aspect of love as a battle that most of us can relate to. My personal favorite: Skin. Sade, smooth and sexy. Welcome back Sade!

The world is changing rapidly and Pink explains how the 3 A's (abundance, automation and Asia) will continue to change how people live and work.

B00005ASHM|4.0|I've been a big fan of sixties music all my life - Beatles, Who, Byrds, Dylan, Stones, Band, Hendrix, Simon & Garfunkel, Small Faces, Springfield, CCR, etc. - all great. \\"California Girls\\" and, especially, \\"Good Vibrations\\" rank with some of the very best 60s songs. But, despite listening to Pet Sounds many times, and really trying to like it, I just don't get it. There should be no question that the music production is absolutely, innovatively, exquisite. Some of the melodies are great, but most are merely good. The lyrics are often silly or preppy, even for 1966. And, while the vocals are lush and generally beautiful, the vocalists seem mostly detached from the subject matter. \\"God Only Knows\\" is thoroughly excellent, while \\"Sloop John B\\" is pretty cool. \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" is a terrific melody, but matched to mediocre, wimpy lyrics. I have to force myself to listen to much of the rest of the album. So, I'd give this album five stars for production, three and a half stars for songs, and three and a half stars for vocals. Personally, I would rather hear great songs poorly produced, than mediocre songs perfectly produced. I would certainly welcome a convincing argument that it's better than four stars!
B00337KM2S|5.0|George Clooney does a terrific job in this drama comedy about the ultimate in alienation in the American work place.  His job is firing people around the country.  But that's just the surface.  He is the ultimate disconnect, the logical progression of where we went as a people in moving our work lives further and further away from the rest of our lives.  Clooney's character made the total jump and has NO life apart from moving from airport to airport and hotel room and hotel room as he does his job. His apartment could be a hotel room.  There are two women who start to warm him up into becoming a human being.  One is a career woman who like he is in the air a lot.  The other is a new female protege who has been hired to revolutionize the whole process so that she can fire people over a laptop linkup.  Clooney will be doing the same.  The young woman, however, unlike Clooney and the career woman, is a ball of emotion over everything.  She took this job solely to follow a man to the city rather than having a man follow her (since she was the top of her class). He breaks up with her and she melts down.  It turns out she wants ALL the personal stuff and this corporate lifestyle was something for her to do before she got it.  So here she is the brightest and most modern of all of them, a whiz at high tech no less, yet she is also the least alienated. The difference is that she is emotional.  Clooney begins to wake up to his own emotions and starts to become a human being as well.  His life begins to get messy in all respects which is what emotions do to us. See this film.  It is terrific.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

The premise is that during the \\"tune out, drop acid\\" time the military got very interested in cultivating esp powers.

Present day Ewan McGregor gets to know him and introduced to him and all his looney buddies who still try and zone out.  Jeff Bridges is one of the looniest.

B000063K2W|5.0|I watch this movie about once a week!!!!  It's like hanging out with my girlfriends - that is good and bad!  Even though it is an old movie - most things haven't changed!  Some women behave well and some behave badly - and it's just so much fun to watch!  When it has been a long day and I feel like relaxing while I'm cooking supper - I pop this into my DVD and smile the whole time. I love the happy ending - if you have seen the modern version - please don't let it mess this up for you.  This is the original and it far outshines the remake.  You just can't improve on the real thing!!
B0021L8UQ2|5.0|I first seen Orphan in theaters and thought it was great, and watching it on Blu-ray is just as great. The story is different than most scary films and the acting is terrific. The video quality and audio quality seemed great to me, though in a few scenes it got a little grainy. The Blu-ray Disc comes with some deleted scenes and an alternate ending which is creepier than the original ending. It also comes with a featurette called, \\"Mama's Little Devils\\" in HD, which takes a look at how Orphan was made and also other movies that feature children as killers. The featurette is good, but I was expecting more out of it. It also comes with a digital copy for a limited time only and the code can also be used for WB Insider Rewards. It was a great movie, but I would have liked more special features.
B00275EGWY|3.0|My problem with the Hurt Locker is that it is marketed and hyped as being unique and accurate while in reality it is not unique and not accurate.  The Hurt Locker is full of the same military cliches that every action movie has:  the main characters answer to no one, they do what they want when they want, and break off into random one-man-army moments like clearing buildings or taking to the streets at night to hunt down bombers.  This is the kind of thing that makes a movie interesting, sure, but it is not accurate.  The inaccuracies mount when you compare how the procedures and tactics of this unit are not consistent with our Army EOD teams.  In the end the movie felt disjointed and I came away from it entertained but confused about what I was supposed to feel about it.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|I really love this album, but as far as I'm concerned this is a Buckingham Nicks album and not Fleetwood Mac. Without Christine McVie being present, there are some more odd songs than I think there would have been, but she did not participate in this effort.  If you look though she has a solo album that was made around the same time, I wonder if these would have been her contributions.      One thing one must remember when listening to Say You Will is that by this point Lindsey had a lot of works backlogged.  He was suppose to release a solo album, but Warner shelved it for a Mac album instead.  So almost all (if not all) are solo songs as far as I am concerned.  Therefore, you can expect a bit more guitars and to be artsy.  I love Lindsey's sound and think that \\"Murrow Turning Over In His Grave,\\" \\"Come,\\" and \\"Red Rover\\" are some of his best works and shows just how much skill he has a songwriter and musician.      While I know some people did not like Nick's work on this album.  I love Stevie, and I think some of her songs are fantastic.  \\"Smile At You,\\" \\"Silver Girl,\\" and \\"Thrown Down\\" are fantastic tracks as far as I'm concerned.  I do realize that some of her songs are older as well, even from the Mirage era.  However, they are still well written tracks that are put together wonderfully.      My one thing I do warn about is that if you are expecting Fleetwood Mac that made Rumours this is not it!  Lindsey has always strived to keep the band from making another Rumours and something that has made Mac last as long as they have because he did do that.  Therefore, do not buy this looking for the Fleetwood Mac of the 70's or even the 80's.  However, if you do enjoy Lindsey's work on this be sure to check out his last two solo albums as they are easily some of the best work he's ever done.

You will sense, too, a new appreciation for your freedom and for the everyday comforts we take for granted all too often. And you will marvel at the hope this young girl held onto, despite her confinement and the bombs falling around her.<br /><br />In addition to the historical perspective readers gain, you will enjoy reading Anne's candid reflections about her development as a teenager, with typical teen reactions--such as resenting authority exerted by her parents and anyone else. Plus, her diary provides a touching story of her first experience of falling in love.<br /><br />Among the numerous inspirational books I have read, this one ranks near the top.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1577361334 The Complete Communicator: Change Your Communication-change Your Life!]]

1400063515|5.0|Dusted this masterpiece off and re-read it again due to the market uncertainties. Times like this everyone has an opinion, but no one has a clue. Taleb's unique background, being a student of randomness, a Wharton MBA, and a former derivatives trader at a hedge fund provides the perfect backdrop for analytical thought in moments of fear and sheer speculation.     These current chaotic financial fears breaths truth in so many statements he makes in Black Swan. I'd highly recommend people pick up a copy for keeping themselves grounded and reducing the urge to make rash decisions. The main thesis is to persuade people to understand the past does not predict the future - aberrations occur that destroy our deeply seated logic and certainty of the ways things should react to uncertainty, but suddenly don't.     All in all, a fascinating, timeless treatise from a philosophical point of view and market based one.
B002AOWXO0|5.0|holy crap!  it's nice to be surprised by an album, and this is one of those times.  Pete Yorn has always been a solid performer, but this collaboration between Scarlett is way better than I ever would have thought.  She has a real smokey jazz-singer vibe here, which, mixed with Yorn's contemporary indie songwriting, produces something really unique.  This album is short, but easily some of the better music of 2009.  I will be looking out for Scarlett's work in the future.

B00005QW5X|5.0|John Cameron Mitchell's \\"baby\\", \\"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\\", may be low-budget, but its depth of content makes it a masterpiece. Mitchell's inspiration is clearly Plato's \\"The Symposium\\", a group of speeches by ancient Greeks who met at a banquet to \\"praise Eros\\". The speeches present different views on the concepts of love and soulmates, and \\"Hedwig\\" uses those philosophical examinations as she takes her own journey to find \\"completion\\". Stephen Trask's soudtrack perfectly reflects the sentiments presented in \\"Symposium\\" but in a quirky, modern way. The centerpiece of \\"Symposium\\", Aristophanes creation story, in which he posits that we began as '3 sexes' rather than 2  who were fused together (male/male, female/female, male/female), then cut in half by Zeus' lightening bolt and left to wander around the Earth looking for our \\"other half\\", is reflected in the song \\"Origin of Love\\", which is the centerpiece of the film. In the movie, Hedwig (born Hansel), has been struggling \\"her\\" whole life; her life changes when she undergoes a botched sex change operation in order to move to America with a G.I. When he leaves, Hedwig is again lost, and she eventually finds her way to Tommy Gnosis, with whom she enters a paiderastic relationship: she gives him knowledge, he gives her affection. Since Hedwig can't literally give birth, her babies are her songs; she prides herself on her music. After teaching Tommy her songs, he \\"runs off with the good stuff\\", and she's left with nothing. Hedwig thinks she has found her soul mate in Tommy, but he turns out to be more \\"bad\\" than \\"beautiful\\". In the end, she must learn that she doesn't need \\"another half\\" to be complete; she is whole all along. A major symbol in the film is the Berlin Wall; Hedwig's wall is her gender identity, which she must \\"tear down\\" in order to \\"be free\\". The images are at first shocking, but once you get past the make-up and wig, what is left is a self-examination so vulnerable, so pure, and so beautiful...
0307712508|5.0|Usually a book is either a great story, or well written, or enthralling or informative. This is one of the few I've ever read that tick all four boxes. I bought the audio version, and even after hours on the road I found myself sitting in the driveway because I was so caught up in the story wanted to know what happened next.  It seamlessly incorporates the writer's journey into  the story of Henrietta and her family, all the while asking ethical questions that need to be answered. It's a wonderful book, and the audio voice is enthralling.  I can't praise it highly enough.
B0031RAOW8|5.0|Forget about MARLEY AND ME. HACHI is a more emotional, honest, and altogether more poignant film about the relationship between a man who adopts a young Akita pup and the bond that develops that between them. It is sad, but in a good way, and even though it has a G rating, it's a more powerful film than MARLEY AND ME, which had some objectionable adult content and a melodramatic, saccharine script. HACHI is superior to it in terms of its filmmaking and central story, a credit to director Lasse Hallstrom (CHOCOLAT) who has made some wonderful movies and adds yet another to his resume here.    Richard Gere is sensitive and wonderful, the Rhode Island location shooting and the low-key script all combine to create a fabulous film suitable for all ages.    Don't miss it -- and be prepared not only to have some kleenexes on-hand (my wife and I both broke down!), but also to do some research into the \\"real\\" Hachi once it's over, as this is based on a legendary true story that happened in Japan in the 1920s. Outstanding!
B001AQT11M|5.0|If it weren't for its ending, I'd say this film was absolute onscreen perfection. By this I mean it has ALWAYS seemed so hugely wrong for Snow White to throw off the dwarfs and all the little forest creatures who saved her life, and run off with the Prince. Without even an onscreen goodbye? That's some cold stuff there. Think what her departure must've done to her friends there in the forest. Seriously callous.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Even without knowing what this film was about, knowing that it was James Cameron's new film and that he spent something like 10 years creating this was enough to know that this was going to be something of a hiccup within movie going society. so going into the film only knowing that the graphics would be 'groundbreaking', i of course thought it would suck. however, i was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />i've heard and spoken to people who were not very impressed by the plot and pass the film off as a 'Pocahontas in space' kind of story, and it's true, that's an accurate description. something to keep in mind however is that all stories borrow from that which came before it, and most often the best stories are simply re-imaginings of earlier ideas. it could be said that pride and prejudice is nothing more than a glorified cinderella story, but that doesn't make it bad. basically, even though this movie is a blockbuster, try to keep an open mind.<br /><br />the film takes place in the future and focuses on this marine, jake sully, who lost the use of his legs on the job. he gets called back to duty when his scientist twin brother dies, to take his place as an operator of an organic being grown from his brother's dna and the dna of the na'vi, the people on the planet pandora. earth is running out of resources and humans want to farm an ore found on pandora (which has become the equivalent of gold or diamonds). so the army recruited a team of scientists to create these beings that could be used to communicate with the natives and essentially move them out of their home so that they can mine the ore underneath the tree they live in. of course the scientists only have a professional interest in pandora, in the people and the land, but are funded by the government/ military and are therefore at the disposal of the source of the funding. on his first journey to panodra, jake gets separated from the other two scientists he's with and is forced to attempt to survive the night in this unknown and deadly jungle. before an unfortunate 'death by jungle dog' incident, he is found by the chief's daughter, neytiri, and she saves him. before she can leave him to fend for himself, the holy being of the na'vi signifies to her that he is important so she takes him home and he is ultimately given a trial period in the tribe to learn the ways of the people. as he learns more about the na'vi he comes to support their perspective. pretty standard stuff, but the plot isn't what grabbed me most about this film.<br /><br />one of the most obvious themes in the movie was the push for environmentalism, or preserving our planet. the reason humans were in pandora was because their planet was dying, because the people on earth used and wasted almost all of their resources. this of course represents the perspective of mainstream north american society. it's pretty much an accepted philosophy that the economy rules nature, destroying nature in the name of money is logical even if it may rub some people the wrong way. it's logical. but people haven't thought this way forever, not all people and cultures think this way, and an alternative perspective is represented in the Na'vi. for them nature is the economy. to harm or destroy whatever is alive is akin to harming yourself. this of course is reminiscent of a sort of aboriginal ideology that takes time to respect the living aspect of nature and the symbiotic relationship they share with it. this connection to nature is presented in a very literal sense in the movie. the na'vi literally connect to their environment. they all have a long pony tail hairstyle, and at the end of their hair are these tentacle- like feelers that can wrap around certain things and allow them to 'plug in' to that thing. this allows them to create a bond with animals they ride and with the tree that represents their deity and holds the memories of their people. this was a lot like the way people today are constantly 'plugged in'. whether it's cellphones, ipods, computers, tv, radio, we are rarely without our technological network to connect us to our world, or the part of our world we care about. it might be harder for the average post-colonial north american to truly appreciate a connection to nature as did pre-colonial societies, so i think the way this was presented helped get that message across.<br /><br />my favourite scene in the movie, and the reason i enjoyed the movie as much as i did was the scene when neytiri and the general were fighting near the end of the movie. i loved it because symbolically they were both 'plugged in' to the technology of their own worlds and were using that connection to fight each other. neytiri was connected to a this wild,

breaking film i've ever seen, nor the best told story, but overall i'd say it was a good movie and worth the watch.computers, tv, radio, we are rarely without our technological network to connect us to our world, or the part of our world we care about. it might be harder for the average post-colonial north american to truly appreciate a connection to nature as did pre-colonial societies, so i think the way this was presented helped get that message across.    my favourite scene in the movie, and the reason i enjoyed the movie as much as i did was the scene when neytiri and the general were fighting near the end of the movie. i loved it because symbolically they were both 'plugged in' to the technology of their own worlds and were using that connection to fight each other. neytiri was connected to a this wild, jaguar/ jungle dog animal through the 'bond' and the general was sitting in this robot, gundam wing/ escaflowne kind of idea. the two of them had to use where they came from

I will be cliched and say that he sounds like a young George Strait (because he does) but his voice is his own. I am really liking this CD, and I think he's got some serious talent and this won't be the last we hear from him!

B001OQCV2O|4.0|When I first heard about \\"2012\\" prior to it's release, I thought \\"Ooh geez, here comes another doomsday piece of quackery.\\"  When I saw the previews, and learned that Roland Emmerich was the director, well, it all made sense.  Of course the visual effects in the trailers were awesome, but I didn't feel like buying into the 2012, end of the world story line. I'd thought Emmerich had been a tad heavy handed with \\"Day After Tomorrow\\" and so I avoided \\"2012\\" at the box office and waited for \\"Avatar.\\"    After seeing \\"2012\\" on Blu-Ray, I admit I was wrong.  If you just suspend disbelief a little bit, sit back, and allow yourself to be entertained, this film will not disappoint.  No mistaking here, willful suspension of disbelief is necessary.  There are just too many close calls, near misses, and coincidences to take the film on anything but a surface level.  But, if you allow yourself to be drawn in to the eye popping special effects, the incredible depth of detail in the CGI rendering of destruction,  the wry sense of humor, you can actually have a pretty good time with this movie.  My son said he can't wait for this film to be turned into some kind of ride at Universal Orlando.    It IS a long movie, and the characters are paper thin, with a plot that hangs on a thread of scientific information. But, it doesn't FEEL long, you become invested in the characters, and the science begins not to matter. In fact, the film's pace moves along quite nicely. And though the characters are thin, you do \\"root\\" for John Cusack to succeed in saving his estranged wife, resentful son, and precocious daughter. Heck, halfway through you even begin rooting for the wife's boyfriend to survive! How the film resolves itself is actually a bit of a surprise (if it hasn't been spoiled for you elsewhere). I actually think that the marketing of the film did a disservice. If more of the character driven moments had been shown in the previews, I probably would have bit on seeing the movie in a theater.     And so, there is an entertaining plot with interesting characters, lot of really excellent visual effects, and a satisfying ending.  It even survives multiple screenings.  The Blu-Ray  2 disc special edition includes a few deleted scenes, an alternate ending (too much suspension of disbelief required), and a variety of behind the scenes featurettes. I think it's a good value.    I do have to mention that the U.S.S. John F. Kennedy aircraft carrier was retired from active duty several years ago, and therefore would not be at sea, in a position to tumble into the White House as a tsunami wipes out Washington in 2012.  Having said that, I must humorously add that Danny Glover's President Thomas Wilson had the entirely wrong line as he looked up to see the ship coming. He should have said, \\"I'm too old for this s#$t!\\"  (Not knocking Danny Glover's performance - just thinking that the call back to \\"Lethal Weapon\\" was dying to be used)

B001NEK2GE|5.0|I'm an avid gamer and actually kind of bought this on a whim.  Soooo glad I did.  I love being able to setup custom profiles for each of my games that load when the game does.  I don't have to mess with the in-game keyboard settings, I just map the keys on the board to whatever key I need.    You can also store the profiles in the keyboard itself so that you can take it with you.  Though, the keyboard unfortunately has somewhat limited space in the number of profiles it can hold.    Overall, I'm very happy with the keyboard and I've only scratched the surface of what it's capable of.  Have barely touched any of the macro functionality.    Additionally I've seen the software improve since I bought the keyboard to add more functionality.    Would highly recommend!

B002N5N5QQ|5.0|WOW!  I saw previews of Season One and honestly I was just going to watch because I like \\"Bad Boy\\" Jax.  Since I am in my 30's, that wouldn't have kept me watching for long. I saw the 1st episode of Season Two and I was addicted!  I bought Season One and all of my questions were answered!  It can be a bit hard to follow but, easy to catch up on.  I can't tell you how many times I was screaming and cheering at the TV!  The music is spot on!  I don't know if Kurt Sutter has anything to do with that or not but, the music always seems to fit what is going on with the club.  The only warning...ladies...if you are like me and like the \\"bad boy\\" thing...don't watch a marathon of Sons...made me want to join an MC...lol!

0316044938|5.0|Wow ... Peter Jackson, this is why I love this guy. Not only is he about cool CGI effects, he can tell one great moving/stunning/magical STORY (with the CGI effects, hehe!). I just got finished watching my copy of The Lovely Bones and this is a really great movie. And yet again, Peter Jackson delivers as he sucks you into this fantasy world of his mixed with part reality. As a great producer/director ... he really touched me emotionally in this film. Though towards the end, it did get quite suspenseful and frustrating for me, but overall, it was a brilliant masterpiece only a producer like Peter Jackson could think up. I enjoyed his journey on the tell of the afterlife and i recommend the rest to experience this ride (especially if you're a fan). This movie will have you thinking what it could possibly be like on the other side for those who have passed on. For those who've read the novel, you already know what the main plot is centered around, but no worries ... this movie is PG-13 ... so the death of Susie Salmon's character is not so explicit like it was detailed in the books. Enjoy this fairytale. Though some parts will naturally make you ANGRY too death, it's really worth the emotional ride. As a fan since the Lord of the Rings trilogy, I really enjoy Peter Jackson's craft in the film industry. Not to mention you get some great beautiful CGI scenes aswell (which I love, especially when they come from P.J.'s work). Keep it up, can't wait for more classic hits. =D
1400034779|5.0|Ladies' Detective a true delight   The Number One Ladies' Detective Agency by Alexander McCall Smith is a delight for young and old. It follows Mma Ramotswe as she solves cases in the beautiful Botswana, Africa. She deals with worried wives, trickery twins, and of course the witch doctor that is feared to have taken a small boy.    This book kept me laughing all the way through, with silly dialogue as well as charming characters. The light-heartiness made it a fun novel and kept me entertained throughout. For example, here is just one of the humorous passages I found myself laughing to.   \\"So,\\" said Mma Ramotswe, \\"when people see a sign saying Number One Ladies Detective Agency, what will they think? They think those ladies will know what's going on. They're the ones.\\"  The lawyer stroked his chin.\\" Maybe.\\"  \\"Yes,\\" said the Mma Ramotswe. \\"Maybe.\\" Adding, \\"Your zip is open Rra. I think you may not have noticed...\\"  This passage shows that despite doubts, Mma Ramotswe was going to prove that she has what it takes to make it in a male based profession. While some reviews claimed the book was too harsh on men, I think that it was meant to not deal with men at all. The author is trying to show that women have not been given the same respect in many countries. It was not long ago that America was dealing with the same problem.    Also, many reviews claimed that the book lacked a plot and was too light. I agree that it was light; however, it would be a stretch to put \\"too\\" in front of that. The cases were enjoyable and interesting, although I agree they lacked a little detail. The main point here is that this is no Odyssey or a work of William Shakespeare's. If the reader was looking for a lengthy challenging story then it is their fault for making this book their choice.    One of my favorite parts of the book is the description of Botswana. Through the writing I got a picture running through my head. I could see the beautiful landscape. It made me feel as though I was right there miles and miles away. While some said it lacked the detail of Africa, I felt it was filled with stories that centered on its beauty.   If the reader is looking for a book that will keep them smiling and won't cause them a headache, then The Number One Ladies' Detective Agency is for them. It is the perfect combination of mischief and mystery, charm as well as creative humor.

B0026NWBY2|4.0|George Harrison confounded the expectations of both fans and critics in his post-Beatles career. Instead of following the progressive rock arc of his late songs with the Beatles (\\"Old Brown Shoe\\", \\"I Me Mine\\", \\"Savoy Truffle\\"), he switched to almost exclusive use of slide guitar and wrote a vein of tunes that were meditative and idiosyncratic.  His triple-album \\"All Things Must Pass\\" was unmatched among solo Beatle projects, but subsequent Harrison albums were spotty.    This collection (\\"Let it Roll\\") is good from start to finish, and covers most of the bases in George's solo career. My only quibbles are the absence of \\"Beware of Darkness\\" from ATMP, and something from \\"33 and 1/3\\" would have been nice, since that album probably was George's second best effort.      \\"Let it Roll\\" was remastered by Giles Martin (son of the Beatles' producer) and engineered by Paul Hicks (son of the Hollies' guitarist, Tony Hicks) and the sound is excellent, putting the focus squarely on George's voice and guitar.  Almost all of the inclusions have improved sound, except for the \\"All Things Must Pass\\" tunes, which sound rather cavernous on headphones. I have no problem with the Beatle material from \\"Concert for Bangla-Desh\\", because that also was a landmark album for George, and without it this compilation would feature no live cuts, only studio material.    The overall conclusion is that George was the best craftsman of the Beatles.  He put together his material meticulously, and if the songs didn't overwhelm at the first listen, years later the professionalism remains impressive.  I would bet that in the future, George may be considered the most musicianly Beatle.
B001UV4XX8|1.0|This move was udderly stupid and waste of time.   Do yourself a favor and go try to get a traffic ticket, that would be more worthwhile than watching this.  This ranks with MARS ATTACKS movie which until now I thought was the worst movie ever made.  Cameron Diaz also needed to fire her makeup artist.  The 70's decor alone almost had me puking.  The movie plot was based in VA. but what was up with the accents they made the actors use, Virginan's don't talk like hicks. Hollywood was way off on this one.  I can't wait for Jay Leno to get a hold of this one.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I just have bought the Beatles white mono box set after a few month because I didn't pay so much attention into it.   On september 9th 2009 I had bought the black stereo box set and forgot about it until recently. Although I didn't like the Cd's design itself I was satisfied with the clear sound. I discovered the mono box set has the album replica of the original vinil pressings and found it really interesting to collect. After having reading a few reviews here I decided to spend my money again and now I must admit I did the right thing. The hole design is gorgeous. The little cd's are pretty housed into the box and they are truly exact as they were.  I really enjoy the mono sound. I began the listening with the white album, one of my favourite Beatle albums.  I had chose this one first because I paid so much attention into the newly remastered stereo double album so I was able to compare them easily. From the very first listening I felt a diferent atmosphere a kind of old vintage sound but I like it. \\"Dear prudence\\" with new guitar passeges, the warble sound of the Clapton solo in \\"While my guitar gently weeps\\", the new loops appeared into \\"Blackbird\\" and \\"Piggies\\". \\"I will\\" don't have the tempo voice until the second verse, also the vocal is much clear in some lines.  But the most diferences are on the second disc. \\"Yer blues\\" has the eco of the room on Lennon voice, I just love it.  The background vocals on \\"Helter skelther\\" are much clear and the song ends one minute before the original master tape. \\"long long long\\" has a double tracking beautiful voice that absolutely love...great Beatle moment!  Some albums are better on stereo, some songs are better in mono...but if you are a deep Beatle fan I recomend you to buy them both. I know they're quite expensive but I think it's not a waste of money.   I do believe they became the music bible of this century again
B000ILYYJE|5.0|In your mind what more could you ask for, this a \\"real\\" box set, featuring twelve disc, all six Doors studio albums on cd-remastered, all six dvds of the albums are remixed and remastered in 5.1 surround. Each disc is securely placed in a plastic holder of each original album cover, unlike the cardboard \\"mini albums\\" that are bound to damage or scratch the disc. Each individual album contains booklets with lyrics, photographs, and history liner notes. The audio is superior, Jim Morrison and the band never sounded better and the set includes twenty four bonus tracks and twelve video performances, some are live, soundstage gigs, and music videos. If you've never heard all The Doors material it's high time to buy this \\"Perception\\" set now - just recently bought this, not for the reason of better audio, for the simple reason of wanting to hear all of The Doors studio work and after listening to all the albums, watching all the live shows, the instrumentation of Robby Krieger, Ray Manzarek, John Densmore, and the singing power of Morrison blew me away, worth every dollar.   NOTABLE MENTION:I'd like to see more reviewers be more specific and informative on their reviews. The Perception set is true to the original recordings, the cds are remastered, only the dvd versions are remixed. Stay away from the single 2007 releases, they are remixed, changed, and not true to the originals, some songs actually drown out Morrison's vocals, some of the mixes of the instruments are out of wack and too loud, just a plain butchering - not one review I've read on the Perception set mention this, to make a long story short, this simple information would've saved me a fistful of dollars.
B000O77SRC|4.0|Here's the Good Flick Test.  While channel surfing, you come across a movie on cable you haven't seen in years--often several years.  You are only surfing due to boredom, or you are fleeing from another show's commercial break; in any event, you are only going to surf for a few minutes, then go about the business of your day or evening.  You have no intention of altering your plans. . .until you come across that Good Flick.<br /><br />Yep.  DIE HARD is one of those.  Who hasn't seen this movie?  More than once?  We're all familiar with the story:  blue collar New York cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) suddenly finds himself in a strained long distance marriage, with his voluptuous wife (Bonnie Bedelia) now employed at a brand new LA high rise.  During a Yuletide visit to the tower (an office Christmas party) the building is suddenly seized by snarling Euro terrorists--while McClane is able to sneak, undetected, to the upper floors still under construction.  From there, he wreaks the havoc all DIE HARD fans have come to know and love, then utters an immortal \\"Yippee-kie-yay\\" epithet as the bad guys go down.  Yes, it's all silly and farfetched; yet Willis is as likeable as he is self-deprecating (\\"Come out to the west coast,\\" he deadpans as he crawls through a ventilation shaft under machine gun fire, \\"have a few laughs. . .\\"), and there is not a better villain in all the cinematic land than Alan Rickman.  We even get to hate a  snotty, arrogant reporter (William Atherton).<br /><br />Forget the plethora of sequels; they're all nonsense supreme and merely take the McClane character to cartoon proportions.  Go with the original DIE HARD; it's darn fun to watch, and worth stopping what you're doing to take in on cable.  Yes, this flick passes the test.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning

B00140PK6O|5.0|This is a masterpiece of historical dramatization.  While faithful to the novel, it translates the action and emotion into a format for modern viewers.  My family has watched this several times with increasing delight at the subtle personalities, the social issues that are evoked, and the lives as they go forward.  The great accomplishment of the series is that, while often funny to the point of absurdity, it never falls into the territory of sitcom or burlesque.  Instead, it retains both its realism and social relevancy in the most exquisite of dramas.  The milieu, while superficially familiar, is in fact quite alien.  Isolated, it is in the thick of victorian era, which can only be described as extremely rarified, full of rules, customs, and traditions that shape decisions that are astonishingly personal, cause mortal worries about the most banal concerns, and lead to intricate misunderstandings.  It is always believable and emotionally accurate, never parody.<br /><br />The cast of characters appears normal, at least for their time. There is Matty, whose elder sister Deborah is the arbiter of \\"the proper\\" in town.  They look out the windows, judging people they see in the street and discussing what course of action would be best.  They take in a niece, who becomes an intimate part of their household because she wishes  to aviod a hasty (or perhaps any) marriage.  A young doctor also comes to town, brimming with ideals and ready to work.  Finally, the gameskeeper for a local aristocrat takes on the welfare of a wonderful child, whose family is part gypsy and dirt poor.  As these characters interact and adapt to the changing world, more and more is revealed, to the point that their cares and hopes become beautifully, painfully poignant.<br /><br />For example, as the young doctor establishes himself as innovative and competent, he is noticed as the most eligible bachelor in a town of gossipy spinsters.  Though he is in love with a local beauty, two older women become convinced he is about to propose to them, in part because of his own kindness but also by a bad practical joke.  When the situation is discovered, he is nearly ruined by the many assumptions people make about his motives.  Another episode involves the sad resolution of an old love:  the beau reappears, after perhaps 40 years, to the woman who refused him because her family needed her due to a personal tragedy.  They loved each other the whole time.  It brought tears to my eyes.<br /><br />The overwhelming impression, at the end, is one of grace.  You come to admire these people, hope for them, and even question your own behavior.  Indeed, according to my wife, a principal purpose of the novels is to pose social dilemmas to the reader.  Very powerful stuff.  Also, unlike the all's-well-that-ends-well stuff that makes many Dickens' endings so sickeningly unbelievable, these novels often end in pain and loss, though the decent society of the town makes up for a lot of it.  There are no deus ex machina solutions.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.

0385504225|2.0|Okay, so Brown is a millionaire author and I'm not.  I've read his earlier four books twice each and enjoyed them.  And enjoyed this one too, to a point.  No spoilers here but he does save some punches for the end.  Yes it does seem at times formulaic and repetitive, as others have stated quite well, and so be it; he makes the millions not me.      Here's my gripe.  When Brown mixes fact with fiction he creates a lot of interest, sells a lot of books, confuses a lot of people, and causes them to go to their libraries and look up their history.  All to the good.  So he buries fake meteorites upside down in the ice in Deception Point; not impossible but nearly pointless in fact.  He has batteries run down in Angels & Demons so predictably that you could set your watches to them; why should any battery run out of juice so absolutely perfectly?  Well never mind - I'm getting off track here.    But when he mentions \\"noetics\\" a dozen times, he's strongly suggesting to his readers that this element of his novel is really factual.  Balderdash.  I would have given this novel 4 stars, but his dumbing-down and mushing-up of the public's understanding of science is a real minus.  The public at large is already confused and bewildered at the amazing complexity of science in today's world; this psycho-babble nonsense is junk.  And harmful.  His characters actually say that wishful thinking can alter probabilities in the real world; woe be to all Vegas casino owners!    Would that it were not so.  Huge areas of uncertainty and vagueness remain in our scientific understanding; perhaps some type of so-called psychic phenonenmon will documented and studied in the future.  But not the way Brown describes it.  That's fiction within fiction, though he suggests it's fact.  As of 2010, we're still waiting for the very first positive results in a properly designed and administered test of psychic mental abilities.  So far we have exactly zero results from such properly conducted experiments; throughout the world; to date.  Maybe in 2011, or 2050, or the year 3000; I'm not holding my breath.  But I wish Brown had kept his fiction more believable and left his wishful thinking for magical mental powers out of it.    Mark
0061537969|1.0|It's a good thing that the author chose the Dog, Enzo, as the narrator because Denny is a very unsympathetic character.  He refused to help take care of his blind mother.  He let his wife suffer for years from obvious symptoms of brain cancer.  He beat his dog for going berzerk after having been locked up for three days without food.  He let a fifteen year old girl seduce him.<br /><br />I understand that race car drivers need to be selfish on the track but they shouldn't be selfish in real life.<br /><br />Much of the book is likely the author trying to convince himself that he's a decent human being.
B001U6YI92|5.0|This is a great movie.  It's not in the John Wayne style, it's more like an opera.  The sound effects are cheesy, but they seem to be that way on purpose, and not in a campy way.    Me, my brother and some of our friend saw this film in the theatre in the 70's.  We were teenagers and we expected to see a traditional western.  We couldn't believe this.  It was like a revelation.    It's what every movie should be, which is entertaining.

Take the excellent scripting work that went into Rome, combine it with the shocking sex and violence of [[ASIN:B001DWNUCO Caligula]], mix in a little of the over the top blood spatter of [[ASIN:B001LF2WCC 300]] and your expectations will be very well set for Spartacus.<br /><br />I remember when HBO's [[ASIN:B001FA1OTU Deadwood]] first came out that some of the public reaction was astonished and skeptic of the portrayal of such a violent and profanity filled Wild Wild West. After decades of Westerns led by squeaky clean John Wayne characters, I'm not surprised. Similar to what Deadwood was going for with the Western, Spratacus leaves nothing for the imagination during its time period. But what makes Spartacus such a classy show is that there's nothing gratuitous. It's all intended to be a very real depiction of how day to day life went in the hierarchies of Rome circa 70 BC. Love, battle, adultery, orgy, torture, rape, murder...it's all there in all its glory...and I mean ALL its glory.<br /><br />The events of Spartacus take place about 20 years prior to those depicted in the HBO Rome series, and it initially focuses on the historical figure Spartacus' enslavement and rise as a gladiator. As of this writing 7 of 13 scheduled first season episodes have aired, and I was lucky enough to catch them all this past weekend over two days in a Spartucus marathon that Starz was running on one of its alternate channels. After only seven episodes, I can say that I have found one of the best new shows--if not the best--on TV. (Edit 4/19/2010: The season finale this past weekend was phenominal.)<br /><br />Spartucus is played masterfully by little known Andy Whitfield. And the rest of the cast is pretty much just as little known as Whitfield. Sure, there's Lucy Lawless and John Hannah, but they are / were hardly A-listers. But the entire cast so far give nothing but A-list performances. (Edit 7/8/2010: Whitfield was diagnosed with non-hodgkins lymphoma in early 2010; he has apparently made a full recovery and will begin filming the 2nd season perhaps as early as fall 2010. Great news. Due to the delay in filming of season 2, a short 6-episode prequel to season 1 will air this fall starring Lawless and Hannah.)<br /><br />My recommendation is to start catching up on this great new show now on Starz On Demand. If you don't get Starz, this series makes the subscription worth it all by itself. But the benefit to waiting for the Blu Ray release is two-fold: The series is certainly worthy of collection so far and on Blu Ray you don't have to wait for the episodes to air on a weekly basis! However you do it, be sure to check out Spartacus: Blood and Sand.A-list performances.

0374532125|3.0|Dead Aid is a 150 page book with a 24 page bibliography - so it reads more like a long white paper than a book. Dambisa Moyo has an impressive resume, much alluded to in both the book jacket and the foreword by Niall Ferguson. The author has worked for the World Bank and Goldman Sachs and she has a PhD from Oxford University. Impressive no doubt. Even more impressive is the fact that she was born and raised in Zambia so her profile fits neatly into the \\"Solutions to Africa's problems by Africans\\" paradigm.<br /><br />The book itself makes its case almost clinically, backed up by statistics and research papers from an entire spectrum of economists. Dead Aid is divided in two sections, The World of Aid, which examines the 'aid-economy', the players and the harmful affects on African countries' dependence on western aid. The second section, A World Without Aid proposes several venues open to the developing countries in Africa to raise money and be independent - the most important being trade and raising capital from the markets. Ms. Moyo manages to connect a lot of different African ailments to aid, from corruption to dictatorship and she makes a convincing case. Her solutions make sense as well - at least to a strong believer in free trade like myself. The hopelessness of it all is that it is almost impossible to imagine the West will roll back its Aid of Africa model that has failed so consistently and for so long.<br /><br />The book's main weakness is that it makes for almost dreary reading. Ms. Moyo may be a brainy economist, she is not a writer. The book suffers from a dearth of wit and style. The author does try to indulge in a hypothetical by creating the composite African country of Dongo and examinig how the country may funciton if her suggestions were realized. But in the end her vision reads less like a fully realized painting and more like a stick figure drawing. I recommend reading the book, only because it serves as a starting point for examining the issue of tackling the many problems of the African continent.he many problems of the African continent.

0805091742|5.0|Checklist Manifesto, is a non-fiction piece documenting the experiences of a surgeon general looking for some method to reduce the madness of a world that is growing increasing complex every year.<br /><br />Whether the topic is building sky-scrapers or successfully pulling off life-saving surgery it seems every qualified profession is going through a process of over-specialisation and the resulting complexity is actually reducing the chances of getting to the outcomes wanted. If you're a surgery patient this is very significant stuff.<br /><br />The Checklist Manifesto explains how the simple process of using a checklist can greatly enhance success, in short by reducing human errors, upping rapport between workers and providing non intrusive guidelines for troubleshooting.<br /><br />Aside from the education in management Checklist Manifesto also provides some interesting insights into some complex professions, medicine obviously and also architecture.<br /><br />A good read for anyone who likes non-fiction, and probably for anyone in a management or strategic role.
B001CEE1YE|4.0|but must admit I'm not a huge Matrix worshiper!! I bought this set for $21.30US, delivered from Amazon UK. It is an all region set. This set is perfect for me as \\"The Ultimate\\" would have been total overkill for a casual fan like myself. \\"Complete\\" has a light helping of extras.<br />The picture and sound on the blu-rays is incredible and will make a great addition to anyone's collection to be used as a demo for how great blu-ray sound and picture are.
1423119509|5.0|When I read some of the other reviews for this product, I was worried that it might be damaged when it arrived. Some reviews stated that the collectors box housing the books was torn or smashed at the corners, which really worried me about ordering it online. After I did my research and found out it cost a lot more at local book stores, I decided to order it. When I recieved the product, I was eager to open it and see how it looked. Not only were the books in perfect condition, but the collectors box looked good as new. I would recommend this box set to anyone who enjoys really good fantasy books. You will not be disappointed.
0525950079|2.0|I was looking forward to reading this book, as I quite enjoyed Pillars of the Earth. However, I was pretty disappointed with it. It is effectively the same book again, but with different character names.     It also is about 500 pages too long. There are plenty of pages, but nothing much really happens in them. The characters are fairly two dimensional and I didn't really care much about them by the end. In fact, I skim read the last half and the last few hundred pages felt like a chore to read. I actually had to force myself to finish it. I just skipped over the sex scenes as they were boring and repetitious.

B002TYZKIM|5.0|What can you say but brilliant on every level. At six years old my mother gave me my first Jackson 5 album and it was pretty much a done deal after that and at 7 my sister took me to my first J5 concert. The man has been in my life ever since and fans of Mike know what thats like. I preorderd my tickets for This Is It and was at the first show the day it opened. I felt like I did at the end of every Michael concert happy free and that love is all around me, then I remembered he wasn't here any more and I was sad. In the same instance I got one more glimpse into his genius and I was happy again.   Even in rehersals he is still the man in control, knows what he wants  The behind the scene footage is good. Out of the five or so featurettes Remembering Michael is the best.  This Is It would have been one of the greatest concerts ever not because I am a fan of Michael's but a fan of music.  That even after all he has been through the man still manages to be generous with his craft and willing to still inspire others to be all they can in this life. He knew the opportunity that he had in his life normal folks couldn't get to but if you where in his life he made sure that you wouldn't give up on your dream. What an amazing man. What an amazing talent. You get to see both with This Is It. Even if your not a Michael fan. You should have it in your collection.
B000SMWUPS|3.0|...it just doesn't last!  We bought our first Buggy Buddy about a year ago to use with our City Mini Stroller.  We were excited to find a reasonably-priced, well-reviewed solution to the sippy cup/water bottle/miscellaneous items problem.  Alas, after a few months, the strap on the left tore, making the Buddy quite useless.  Thinking perhaps we had over-loaded the compartments, we bought a SECOND Buggy Buddy a few months ago.  Today, the SAME strap ripped--naturally while on the way into a store--and my water bottle, phone, wallet, and granola bar all went flying everywhere.  I will NOT buy a third one, but will go search for a more rugged option...it's too bad though, because the concept is exactly what is needed!
B002QW7AJY|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie but the digital copy that comes with it is just about useless. It is only Windows Media playable so you cannot load on I-pod and MAC users are just out of luck. This is the only digitial copy that I have some across with this problem and it seems like such a bizarre move.
0764207407|5.0|I have always enjoyed Jane Austen's books and film adaptations of Jane Austen, and I have always been troubled by the fact that more younger people are not exposed to the classics rigorously enough in high school English literature classes.<br /><br />For schools or parents who feel like Jane Austen's books may be a bit cumbersome for their students or children, then this book provides an alternative.  Instead of tampering with the language or feeling of the original manuscript, it provides fun asides.<br /><br />The margins of the book are dotted with factoids.  Some of the details focus on Austen's life, others on English life in general during the time period.  Historical details are discussed in some, while slight religious themes addressed in the book are presented in others. The notations add a lot to the book without altering it, and I think it could prove handy for getting children excited about great literature.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received a review copy of this book from Bethany House in order to facilitate my review.
B002HWRZH0|2.0|I ordered this set back in November.  I didn't open it until the beginning of March because I didn't have a Blu-ray player until then.  I was excited to crack the box open and proudly display the replica of the Enterprise on my desk, but as soon as I pulled it out of the styrofoam packaging, one of the warp engine nacelles just fell off.  My bad for not opening it sooner, but now Amazon does not have any of these left to replace it and I'm left with a ship without an engine.  Poor quality control here folks!!   The Blu-ray is awesome, however, so don't waste your money on this set, just buy the Blu-ray and wait until better models are available (which I hope is someday soon).
B0031OCY2E|1.0|I rented this movie because the reviews said it was funny and refreshing.    Clearly these critics where paid off.     This movie was terrible. Firstly, within the first 20 mins of this movie you do not care about Matt Damons character. He is at first clearly gullible, narcisstic and to sure of himself. I hate those people.     Next, its about The ADM company. ADM (Archer, Daniels,  Midland company)...now if this is not exciting I don't know what is.  The movie was about price fixing...wow does it get any better than price fixing. However, it turns out to be more about lies and deception. (Get it...its a hodge podge of elements that do not work well)    In the end, the movie was a mess and a snoozefest.     I am really starting to see pattern with Hollywood. Movies that stink get the most praise and critical buzz just to get people to buy its waste products.  Movies that are really good....people like you and me rave about. Critics either hate them or never talk about them.    Matt Damon, love your movies but leave these types of garbage rolls for your friend the most terrible actor ben Affleck.    WARNING!!!....there is nothing funny about this movie!!!!......You have been warned!!!!!!

1439170045|5.0|Because of the way this remarkable novel about Alzheimer's Disease is written, the reader is able to \\"live it\\" through total empathy with the protagonist Alice.<br /><br />Author, Lisa Genova, a neuroscientist, wove the latest scientific information into the story, as Alice rapidly progressed through early-onset Alzheimers. (\\"Ten percent of people with Alzheimer's have early-onset and are under the age of 65. Its cause usually has a strong genetic linkage, and it manifests much earlier.\\")<br /><br />At first, Alice was subjected to a battery of neurophyschological tests, including: Stroop, Raven's Rotation, Boston Naming, WAIS-R Picture Arrangement, Benton Visual Retention and NYU Story Recall, \\"designed to tease out any subtle weakness in the integrity of language fluency, recent memory, and reasoning processes.\\" Alzheimer's isn't a disease that shows up in an MRI -- Alice had nothing abnormal in hers, \\"no cerebral vascular disease, no evidence of any small, silent strokes, no hydrocephalus or masses.\\" Everything looked fine, in spite of her cognitive decline. She was diagnosed by process of elimination.<br /><br />Then she was screened for APP, PS1 and PS2 mutations. \\"The mutations are fully penetrant.\\" People who test positive for APP, PS1, or PS2, have a solid confirmation of the diagnosis. (\\"We don't yet know the gene in which their mutation resides.\\") In spite of the fact that Alice took the two drugs now available for treating Alzheimer's (Aricept and Namenda), and despite the fact that she was in top physical condition for a 49 to 50 year-old, her decline was extremely rapid.<br /><br />Alice tested positive for the PS1 mutation, which is \\"autosomal dominant,\\" meaning that Alzheimer's will certainly develop. When Alice found out, the first thing she thought of was her three children. Upon testing, (one of her children declined to be tested) one of the other two tested positive.<br /><br />A substance called \\"amyloid beta\\" accumulates in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. Alice's doctor encouraged her to keep running, saying, \\"There's convincing data in animal models that suggest exercise alone can slow the accumulation of amyloid-beta and cognitive decline.\\"<br /><br />Although she had a loving, supportive husband and children, Alice's friends began to shun her. \\"Facing her meant facing her mental frailty and the unavoidable thought that, in the blink of an eye, it could happen to them.\\"<br /><br />When Alice stopped by the Alzheimer's Special Care Unit, she learned that the rate was $285 per day.<br /><br />Alice and her husband John, stunned by the rapid progression of her disease asked the doctor, \\"Should she be like this after only a year and being on medication?\\" He responded that her illness probably started long before it was diagnosed. He also said, [Alice is] \\"incredibly bright. If the average person has, say... ten synapses that lead to a piece of information, Alice could easily have fifty. When the average person loses those ten synapses, that piece of information is inaccessible to them, forgotten. But Alice can lose those ten and still have forty other ways of getting to the target. So her anatomical losses aren't as profoundly and functionally noticeable at first.\\"<br /><br />On a page by itself, about halfway through the book: \\"The well-being of a neuron depends on its ability to communicate with other neurons. Studies have shown that electrical and chemical stimulation from both a neuron's inputs and its targets support vital cellular processes. Neurons unable to connect effectively with other neurons atrophy. Useless, an abandoned neuron will die.\\" There you have it.<br /><br />What can any of us do who are predisposed to this disease, until it begins to present itself? The author (through a character speaking at a Harvard commencement ceremony) suggests: \\"Be creative, be useful, be practical, be generous, finish big.\\" I agree, these are great suggestions for leading a fulfilling life.<br /><br />Might I also add: be proactive about supporting scientific and medical research, and be sure to budget for the very best health insurance policy you can obtain.<br /><br />Any one of us, at any moment, can go from being healthy to being mentally or physically unwell; in the blink of an eye.e to budget for the very best health insurance policy you can obtain.

I know there were a lot of people that did not like this book and everyone is entitled to their own opinion! But I enjoyed this book the most out of the whole series! I love the fact that SM went into the detail that she did.

B0031RAOVY|5.0|This film is wonderfully shot, includes subtle symbolism in the scenes (hint: look at the train station decorations and time on the clock near the very end of the movie) and is probably the most pure, simple and emotional movie I have ever seen.<br /><br />I don't understand why this great film was not promoted more and/or did not get a good solid American release.  I would not even have known about it unless I saw it on the New Releases for Blockbuster.  It was filmed in early 2008, released in Japan in August 2009 ..... then simply placed on the \\"Direct to DVD\\" market here in the USA.  I never heard anything about this movie even being made until stumbling across it by chance luck.<br /><br />A great and well done movie like this deserved better promotion and press treatment.  It is a shame because many people may miss out on this film.<br /><br />I can only guess that budget over runs and limited financing left no money in the budget for advertising after the filming was done ?  Anybody know ?<br /><br />Or are American audience now only fascinated with fancy CGI visual effects \\"eye candy\\" and no story ?<br /><br />In either case ... This movie deserved and still deserves more attention !<br /><br />So on to the movie itself ...<br /><br />A tough guy like me does not usually get choked up over movies, but here is one I can recommend to you that will probably touch you.<br /><br />It is based on a true story from Japan ... although this version with Richard Gere has been shifted to USA.<br /><br />Basically this is the story if you don't already know it.<br /><br />WARNING SPOILER BELOW ........<br />.........<br />............<br />..........<br /><br />A college professor had a dog that was loyal to him.<br />Each day it would follow him to the train station where he left for work.<br />The dog would run around and do whatever all day long.<br />But at 5:00 in the evening the dog was always back at the train station to meet his owner.<br />This went on for years,<br /><br />One day the dog was waiting at the train station, but the professor never showed up.<br />The professor had died of a heart attack at the school campus that day.<br /><br />For the next 9 years, the dog kept waiting and looking for it's owner at the train station everyday.<br />Other people would try to take the dog home, but every time the dog would run away and return to the train station trying to wait for the professor.<br />He became a local legend and the other people at the train station each day would bring the dog food and water to take care of him since the dog refused to leave his post.<br /><br />Eventually 9 years later the dog died, still sitting at the train station watching the people get off every train, looking for his owner.<br /><br />Today in Japan where this really happened they have a bronze statue of the dog sitting in the train station as a tribute to that kind of loyalty.<br /><br />.........<br />..........<br />.........<br />.........<br /><br />END OF SPOILER<br /><br />I suppose the reason I found this particular story touching enough to even put a lump in my throat was two reasons ..<br /><br />1)  I have always thought there is something innocent and pure about an animals loyalty and affections that is rare in humans.<br /><br />2)  When I was young and walking to elementary school, my friend had a dog named Pal.<br />He would follow us when we walked the 2 miles to school.<br /><br />He would wait for us all day long.<br />I can remember sitting in classes and looking out the window and seeing that dog under a tree looking at the school building and waiting for us to get out.<br /><br />When we got out of class in the afternoon he would be all excited and come running to meet us and follow us home again.<br /><br />This went on for around 2 years as I recall.<br />But one day when we got out of school, the dog was all excited to see us and came running across the parking lot.<br />We started yelling \\"NO PAL. STOP\\"<br />But it did not help.<br />Pal ran in front of a school bus in the parking lot.<br /><br />Now being older and wiser, I look back at this story from childhood and think ..........<br /><br />Yes, it is a cute story about boys and their dogs growing up together.<br />But the real world is not the 1800 or early 1900s of farmhouses, dirt roads and horse & buggies anymore.<br />The world is an urban , mechanized jungle that is dangerous for loosely roaming animals.<br />If people really care about their animals they should not let them run around loose all day long to get hit by cars or other dangers.<br /><br />This is one of those rare movies you see in life that will leave an impression.<br /><br />Well done to everybody who worked on this project !ing up together.

B002QW7AJY|2.0|Dis you like Alien? Did you like Event Horizon? Then you won't like Pandorum. This movie is a classic example of a good idea poorly executed. The story: a guy wakes up on a deep space ship heading to colonize an alien world. He finds out that the ship is in trouble: it is off course and there are alien monsters running around snacking on the crew and passengers (oh dear!!). What to do..Waht to do..What..to..do..    If you don't figure out the entire movie 30 minutes into Pandorum, then you were'nt paying attention. That's the problem, no real surprises. Plus the whole \\"why don't they call back home\\" idea is handled by destroying the Earth. How? That was never really explained (BOOM - it blew up, move on..)    This movie is not bad, its just not interesting. A better script would have helped; this is another version of the Posieden Adventure. The monsters seem to be thrown in as an after thought.    Skip it.

B001UV4XWY|3.0|[[ASIN:B0006GAOBI Richard Kelly's]] latest film, THE BOX, is a remake of an old [[ASIN:B00068NVMK Twilight Zone]] episode penned by Richard Matheson called \\"Button, Button.\\"  The story is about a young, penurious couple that are visited by a stranger with a box.  The box is fitted with a button, and if the couple pushes the button, they will be awarded more money than they've ever seen.  The catch: somewhere someone they don't know will die.  The TV show's punch came at the end, after the couple decides to push the button.  The stranger shows up immediately and gives the couple their money.  He takes the box and prepares to leave when the wife asks what he will do with the box.  \\"The box will go to another couple,\\" the man says.  \\"Who?\\" they ask.  He smiles.  \\"Don't worry,\\" he says.  \\"No one you know.\\"<br /><br />Zing!<br /><br />This is where the TV show ends, wisely, letting the dawning realization provide the story with its emotional force.  This, however, is just where the movie gets started.  When I heard the concept for the film, I wondered how Kelly could take a twenty minute television segment and turn it into 100 minutes worth of movie.  The answer?  He gets weird.  For Kelly, this is no big surprise.<br /><br />Saying much more would spoil the movie's bizarre second and third acts.  Needless to say, our young couple (played well by Marsden and not-so-well by Diaz), grapple with the after-effects of their decision to press that button, an action with repercussions that stretch out to their young son, Diaz's lecherous students, and Marsden's coworkers at NASA.  Also, lightning?<br /><br />I don't know.  The film makes a modicum of sense when it wants to (although without much grace, since the movie's answers are so complex, they necessitate some very deliberate spelling out), but mostly it's just an excuse for Kelly to demonstrate the cinematography and imagery his work is so famous for.  There are some truly creepy moments in the movie -- ever have an entire library of people turn and stare at you at the exact same time? -- as well as some eye-ball popping sets and scenes, but it's all just elaborate window dressing on a concept that worked better when it actually had no window.  In other words, the TV show worked because it didn't need to be explained and -- furthermore -- because it contained portents instead of actual doom, leaving viewers to imagine the doom themselves.<br /><br />THE BOX, as striking as its imagery may be, is a weak film if for no other reason than because of its glut of answers, because of its In Your Face Doom.  It's a guarantee that audiences of the TV show, if they wondered about the box's origins and functions, would NEVER have imagined the solutions posed by Kelly, and in that sense the movie is fresh and new.  But in the same sense, it means that all the niggling ominousness of the original tale is replaced by chaotic sci-fi tomfoolery.  Viewers with a philosophical bent might find something here worth mulling over, and fans of sci-fi eye candy need look no further, but it's a fair bet that everyone else will leave the film feeling disappointed.re at you at the exact same time? -- as well as some eye-ball popping sets and scenes, but it's all just elaborate window dressing on a concept that worked better when it actually had no window.

Viewers with a philosophical bent might find something here worth mulling over, and fans of sci-fi eye candy need look no further, but it's a fair bet that everyone else will leave the film feeling disappointed.

0060512806|1.0|I have read a lot of Stephenson. I expected a bit more from him on this one.  The story is choppy and piecemeal. He regularly goes off on worthless tangents which provide nothing to the story. The characters are not at all believable, nor consistent nor well supported by background detail. At one point a character dies then magically reappears later in the story. Then there's this bad guy who shows up in the middle of jungle in a suit and tie and no real reason to be there to wreak havoc and invent some real conflict in this slow moving waste of a book.    SKIP THIS ONE!!!
B000H0MKO2|3.0|Thank You for Smoking, 2006 film    The film opens on a TV show with Joan Lunden. A 15-year old was diagnosed with cancer. Neil Naylor, a lobbyist for a tobacco company, is one of the guests. Twelve hundred people die each day from smoking tobacco. Is there a link between nicotine and cancer? [No, it's the tars and residue from the smoke.] Naylor is a \\"spin doctor\\", an advocate for his cause. Watch him work! The \\"St. Euthanasius\\" school? Lobbyists talk for living. People who tell you what to do and what to think (like newspaper columnists). \\"Challenging authority\\"? Does an \\"endless appeals system\\" make our government the greatest? Can it be proved? \\"If you argue correctly you are never wrong.\\" [Can that be proven?] \\"That was unnecessary.\\" Do movies sell cigarettes? [Yes.]    Senator Ortolan Finisterre is from Vermont, he is against smoking. Big Tobacco hopes to put cigarettes in all the movies, like in the past. The conversation is comically cynical. \\"What motivates you?\\" \\"Population control.\\" \\"California is not a safe place.\\" Jeff McGall is a power in Hollywood. He has ideas for cigarettes. [Are multinational corporations like child murderers?] Naylor has to deliver a suitcase full of money to a man in Southern California. \\"Let's talk.\\" The talk is funny. \\"How did you know he'd take the money?\\" One man calls in a threat to Naylor. What will he do? Terrorists kidnap Naylor in broad daylight from a street in Washington! Where is Homeland Security? He wakes up in a hospital. \\"Cigarettes saved your life.\\" But he must quit cigarettes. \\"Nicotine patches are deadly.\\" Public sympathy is on Naylor's side now. Reporter Heather Holloway has a story on Naylor: he is doing it for the money. Bad publicity! Naylor is fired because of this scandal. He is going downhill. Joey cheers him up.    Naylor has new ideas. He has a press conference to say he will testify at the Senate Hearing. Naylor proclaims the dangers of cholesterol from the cheese of Vermont! His advocacy of \\"personalchoice\\" and individual freedom trumps the idea of a skull and crossbones on each pack of cigarettes. He will be rehired as a lobbyist now. Or will he? The last scenes show what happened to the other people. \\"There is no direct evidence that links cell phone usage to brain cancer.\\" [But they carry this warning label in Europe!]    I suspect the book was better than this film. It is funny in spots as a satiric comment on advertising in society. But the humor requires a point of view to agree with the story. This film is clever in presenting situations that are ambiguous so it plays to both points of view. Big Tobacco and its lobbyists are the heroes, a Senator from Vermont is the villain. Isn't that too perverse?
0380018179|5.0|Great book! A life story that makes you forget about everything else and read from cover to cover. It is not only wise and captivating, but also educating in terms of rich language.
B000Y9Q59W|2.0|This review refers specifically to the [[ASIN:B000Y9Q59W \\"Wall Street\\"]] Blu-Ray release.<br /><br />I already owned this film on DVD, but upon aquiring my first HDTV, \\"Wall Street\\" was among the first five Blu-Rays I bought. This is one of my favorite films from the eighties, and were I simply reviewing the film itself it would unquestionably earn a solid five stars. Unfortunately, as I've discovered, the wise Blu-Ray consumer should seek out transfer reviews prior to buying, particularly on older titles.<br /><br />Some eighties films, such as [[ASIN:B000OCZD5G \\"The Road Warrior\\"]], look so incredible on Blu it seems as if they were made yesterday. \\"Wall Street\\", however, looks no better on Blu than the two-disc DVD release [[ASIN:B000RW3VD4 \\"Wall Street\\" (20th Anniversary Edition)]]. The picture is slightly sharper on the Blu, but the difference between the two is almost entirely negligible.<br /><br />If you don't own this film, definitely grab this Blu-Ray. The picture is quite good (though it's extremely grainy, even with noise reduction), the special features are nice, and it can often be found for only ten to twelve dollars. If you already own the previously mentioned two-disc release, there is absolutely no reason to double-dip. Trust me, you'll be disappointed!

4789004546|5.0|This is one of the very best Japanese grammar books on the market. I would say that this book is best suited for those who already have a working knowledge of basic Japanese grammar, and not just starting out fresh. You should be able to read kana and maybe even kanji.<br /><br />I discovered it during my second year living in Japan and wish someone had told me about it sooner. It would've saved me a lot of head-scratching and frustration. Packed into its 600 pages is a wealth of information that would take several years to accumulate on your own, even with formal study. It's a dense and moderately heavy text, but still small enough to be portable (about the size of a VHS tape case). Explanations are organized by letter, A-Z, for easy reference like a normal dictionary. In the back is an English index, then a Japanese index, so looking up a particular grammar point is very easy.<br /><br />For each grammar point, multiple examples are given to show you context and usage within a sentence. All example sentences are given in Japanese first, then under it, the romaji, then finally the English translation. I have never found a textbook that explains grammar points as concisely and clearly as this book. Many books I've used offer situation-based lesson that contain very artificial and stilted dialogs. This has none of that. If you're trying to read a newspaper or magazine and find a tricky phrase, you can easily look it up here. I'd often just flip to a random page while taking the train and be amazed at just how frequently I'd hear the grammar being used in my daily life without me fully understanding what was being said (the inclusion of a tiny particle or verb suffix can totally invert the meaning of a sentence).<br /><br />[[ASIN:4789007758 A Dictionary of Intermediate Japanese Grammar]] and [[ASIN:B001GOVW4M A Dictionary of Advanced Japanese Grammar]] are also available when you are ready to move on. I also recommend the excellent [[ASIN:4770023529 A Dictionary of Japanese Particles (A Kodansha Dictionary)]] for tackling those tricky particles like \\"ni, o, ga, wa\\".Kodansha Dictionary)]] for tackling those tricky particles like \\"ni, o, ga, wa\\".

B002HWRYJE|2.0|The plot is absurd.  The only thing that saves this movie from a one star rating is all of the visual eye candy.  Why do people think they need to take a good thing and re-write it?  I'm all for a good re-make -- as long as it stays true to the story line and franchise.  Come on people, how ridiculous is it for Kirk to go from cadet to captain in 60 minutes?  I hope these people NEVER get to meddle with Star Trek again.

B001OQCV2E|1.0|The movie is absolute crap.  The trick to making such a movie is to make the unreal seem real and believable, but this director took another approach entirely.  The movie was so hokey that for a while I actually thought they were going to have the boob doctor (who had a  couple of lessons on a Cessna)  captain a broken space ship off the planet and save the common man.  Grade:  F-

B001P9EQH8|5.0|I upgraded my headphones from the Apple standard earbuds to; [...]. It was a great move, they sound great and I hate earbuds. I was concerned that an iPod wouldn't properly drive a larger headphone, but it worked out just fine, except that I noticed a decrease in battery life by about 20%.<br />I can't quote exact numbers or reasons for this, but thought; if this amp drives the headphones from itself instead of the iPod I can extend my iPod battery life. Well, it worked. I got my battery drain fixed, and the increase in volume is noticeable.<br />The sound is as good as I could hope for at 20.00, and with no distortion or coloring. I'm well pleased with the purchase and recommend the product provided your expectations are reasonable. Perhaps the difference for me is the type of headphones I use, some have said they saw no improvement, I can't offer any other explanation for that.
0307271862|4.0|Henning Mankell's new crime novel does not feature my favorite Swedish detective, Kurt Wallander, but similarly to the earlier novels it keeps the reader glued to its pages till the end.<br /><br />\\"The Man form Beijing\\" begins in January 2006, with a horrible mass murder of nineteen inhabitants of Hesj&ouml;vallen, a small hamlet in Sweden. The victims, most of them elderly people, belong to only three families. The news shakes all Sweden, but the police are puzzled. They have no clue who would commit a crime so heinous in such a remote place.<br /><br />Birgitta Roslin, a judge, reads about the homicide in a newspaper and the village name rings a bell - it turns out her mother grew up there. Intrigued, Birgitta decides  to go to Hesj&ouml;vallen (using the time he has on her hands during prescribed sick leave). She becomes very emotionally involved in the case and begins her own investigation. Although not taken seriously by the police, Birgitta continues her quest for truth, which takes her to Beijing and unfolds events taking place in China, America and Africa. After several months, Birgitta emerges changed, with different view of the world and her own place in it...<br /><br />The novel, evenly paced, but keeping the reader in suspense, is a multifaceted thriller, not a crime story where the course of events can be guessed. I was very interested from the beginning to the end, although I found that some threads were ether insufficiently wrapped up or reappeared from nowhere (see the red ribbon, the most important clue!). As often happens in Scandinavian novels, there is a rich background of social and judicial systems in Sweden, always interesting as a comparison with less socialist states. Nevertheless, it was a good entertainment, although not matching Larsson's \\"Millennium\\" trilogy, another Scandinavian mystery thriller of comparable scope.

B0013USZHG|5.0|This CD is very, extremely energetic; particularly selection #4 (DANZON No.2 (Marquez)! What amazes me more is that the performing artists are youngsters! Their sound is 'superb' symphony-quality! A cup of hot coffee and this CD are major parts of my morning driving routine! By the time I get to work, I'm ready for the orders of the day! I strongly recommend this CD to anyone who is looking for a little 'oomph' in their ears!
0307987698|1.0|This is a lame book. It seemed like they wanted to shove Elmo into a classic book, rename it, and kind of 'pass the torch' to Elmo, or maybe 'trump' Grover with Elmo. There is no reason to dd anything or any other Muppet. The book was great, and is a Sesame Street classic. Just because Elmo is maybe the favorite Muppet right now, doesn't mean they have to stick him everywhere!  Retire this book, and don't have a book that will take away from the great original!  As with movies, 'sequels' are not always the best.  Put this book to rest, take it out of print, and leave a success where it belongs.  I loved the original as a kid, and will not bother buying this for anyone.  Let the kids tell Grover to turn the page, not have a lame awkward insertion of Elmo telling Grover to turn it!  This is beneath Elmo!
B002VPE1B6|3.0|The effects are amazing. The story is sub-par, and there are only a couple of competent performances in an otherwise wooden cast. There is a reason that this didn't win any real academy awards (outside of visual effects)... this is more of an amusement park ride than anything else-enjoyable, but by no means a masterpiece (it's not even Cameron's best film). You are guaranteed to be disappointed when you watch at home in 2D.
B000025XKM|5.0|I heard the music of Nick Drake from a move called Driving Lessons with Rupert Grint & Julie Walters. I loved all the music from the movie.

B0016CVMRQ|4.0|All right, I know it wasn't exactly critically acclaimed.  The sparse dialogue and faulty structure might make the musical a less desirable watch, but it certainly is a gorgeous listen.    Every song is a gem in itself, and the French lyrics are not only beautiful, but pleasing to the ear.  The singers are very talented, and each has their own unique voice.  When harmonies are created, you float into happiness.  For example, listen to the songs \\"Belle\\" and \\"L'attaque de nodre dame\\".    This recording is a steal, over fifty songs!  Some of them are, admittedly, short, but you must buy the full soundtrack instead of the highlights, or risk losing some of the most soaring melodies, catchy tunes, and epic ballads in the musical.  Not that the songs on the highlights version are bad, but you'll miss so much.    One problem is that there is clapping before and/or after every single number, and for the finale songs, throughout the entire thing.  This might be obnoxious at first, but is of little consequence once you get used to it.  However, if you want a squeaky clean track for a specific reason, you might want to buy the concept album.    Another problem: some of the songs sort of muddle together.  Viewed by themselves, though, they're wonderful.  There aren't any deviances from the main, soothing, dark, classical music \\"mood\\".    All in all, as a soundtrack, it's become one of my favorite!  Definitely watch some of the performances with subtitles on Youtube if you're not sure about buying it, or want to see what's really going on.    And, I'll capitalize for emphasis, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DO NOT BUY THE ENGLISH VERSION.  THE LYRICS ARE BUTCHERED.  I'M NOT KIDDING.  THEY SING THINGS LIKE \\"IF YOU NOD YES WITH YOUR HEAD\\", \\"CRAZY DESIRE YOU BRING\\", ETC.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE BUY THE FRENCH, EVEN IF YOU DON'T SPEAK IT (I don't either).    My favorite tracks, in no particular order:  \\"Un Matin Tu Dansais\\", \\"Belle\\", \\"La Sorcerie\\", \\"Ces diamants-la\\", \\"Danse mon Esmeralda\\", \\"LaMonture\\", \\"Le Temps Des Cathedrales\\", \\"L'attaque de Notre Dame\\", \\"Etre pretre et aimer une femme\\"
B000N680VW|5.0|A must for any afficionado of Batman movies.  My kids loved seeing each new \\"toy\\" as Batman discovered the secret arsenal he had and then the creation of the Bat Cave.  And, in my humble opinion, Christian Bale is still the best of the Batman actors.
1582701709|5.0|This book is very inspirational.  I like to think of the universe that it refers to as God, and I feel it is very biblically oriented.  I loved it so much that I sent it to all my daughters.
0316069906|1.0|I wanted to like this book; it was so obviously inspired by \\"Michael Pollan's The Omnivore's Dilemma & I thought it would be a useful addition to my bookshelf. Instead, we are given few industry facts buried within an extensive autobiography of the author's family. I'm happy that his Grandmother survived the Nazis and that he has a strong Jewish family tradition, but do we really need to be told so, repeatedly, and in a book ostensibly about food?<br /><br />I would have been just as disturbed had the author kept banging on about being Christian, Muslim or Scientologist. Many of us believe our grandmothers were blessed with a certain cooking ability and who have impressed certain behavioral influences upon us, but is it appropriate to belabor so in a book about \\"Eating Animals\\"?<br /><br />The narrative is OK, as the author is an experienced fictional writer. In my opinion, and as others here have said, he should stick to doing so. Straddling autobiographical, investigative and fictional modes, as he has done with this book, takes an expert hand. Safran is not up to the job, and it simply makes the book tiresome to one who cares less about the religion and family history of the Safran family than the author does. He should have perhaps reconsidered the title, as it is certainly  misleading.

B000VWYJ86|5.0|In \\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\" Director Paul Greengrass and Mr. Damon continue to blow away the action genre/paranoid style in the third movie of the Bourne series.  When Mr. Ludlum first wrote these books in 70's and 80's, the author would probably not realize that these books would become excellent movies in the first decade of the 21st century.  Unfortunately, the same concerns are as relevant as they were 30 years ago.  In comparing \\"Ultimatum\\" to the two previous movies, this film seems to be the most politically vibrant of the series.  One can find it hard to believe that Mr. Ludlum would have envisioned his main character getting water-boarded like an inmate at Guantanamo Bay, but that again shows the flexibility of the paranoid action film.  Several of the technocrats in this movie show unsurprising similarities to speeches and thoughts of neo-conservatives.  David Strathairn's convincingly evil station chief says that \\"we are the sharp edge of the stick\\" and \\"it ends when we've won.\\"  Of course, as Americans found out from their war efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq, the truth is far more complicated.  Of course, at the end of this political/morality tale, Joan Allen's character says that this is not who we are and of course the evil technocrats are arrested.  Overall, the best \\"Bourne\\" movie and quite possibly the best action move of the last decade.
B0029LHW68|5.0|My daughter introduced me to Thirty Seconds To Mars about a year ago. I can't get enough of their music. Lyrically and musically, they are introspective and inspirational, reaching deeply into the intensity of the Soul. This is music I can listen to again and again and I always seem to come away with something more each time. Artists that have the ability to reach so many, affecting them on an individual level as well as a collectively, are rare. I look forward to more and more from this outstanding kick ass band.

B0000019HU|1.0|When I was a youngster just getting my indie wings with albums like Lonesome Crowded West and Doolittle, I saw this album and thought it looked interesting. With two supposed classics under my belt, I listened to this album late at night while I was by myself in my room one time (that's when I always listen to music I've been anticipating, just for the amazing atmosphere it provides, or used to) and I couldn't finish the album. I felt disappointed, like I was missing something, or there was something I wasn't getting. So, I tried again, and finally managed to finish all of it. I came out feeling pretty much the same as I did going in. Tired, a little agitated, and somewhat bored. In a few days, I bought the Mountain Goats album \\"Tallahassee\\", which is now my favorite album. Also, I later tried to get into the nitty-gritty indie albums shortly after giving up on Spiderland, and enjoyed a lot of what I heard very much and came back to it, but this is one classic I just couldn't appreciate, I guess. The lyrics are good I suppose, and I like chaotic and minimalistic music as much as the next indie fan, but this seemed to over do it a bit. I don't care for slacker music, but just flat-out lazy and droning riffs that seem almost purposely made to sound boring and flat is a little different. Also, the whole spoken word thing seems to be the same thing. Maybe they just did everything in a way that was so weird and non-technical or traditional that it would instantly appeal to fans of weird music, reguardless of whether they actually liked it or not? Or maybe it's just me. To each his own, but this just isn't for me.

I have heard that it is a total guy flick so I am thinking that part might be right. I did not care for the story line or the characters. Certain scenes were dragged out way more than they needed to be, losing my interest on a lot of the movie. I wish I would not have wasted the money I spent because we will never watch it again. I would recommend renting it before buying.
0439023491|5.0|*** DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW UNLESS YOU'VE ALREADY READ The Hunger Games. ***<br /><br />How could things get any worse or any more tense after Katniss and Peeta won the Hunger games? Both of them are alive, and they made it home. But Kat has to deal with Gale, her (male) best friend and hunting partner who is confused about their relationship. The whole nation saw the televised kiss that Kat gave Peeta, and their love (even if it was staged for the cameras) kept Kat alive. If that were the only problem, we'd have a slight Edward Cullen/Jacob Black situation on our hands, and the book would be a disappointment. Good, but not great.  (Yet, who would be Edward and who would be Jacob?)<br /><br />But the bland and menacing President visits Kat and with blood on his breath (yes, actual blood, ugh...) he commands her to quell any possible uprisings in other districts and show allegiance to the Capitol. Apparently, by threatening to eat the berries, Kat was defying the Capitol and giving people hope and defiance for the first time in years. Kat's mockingjay pin, her standard, has become an underground symbol of the resistance.  If, by her words and deeds, she cannot manage to crush any uprisings, her family, and Peeta's and Gale's, will be killed.<br /><br />Fatal ultimatum for both parties. Kat immediately plans to run away, taking everybody with her. But she can't take the whole village, and she owes almost everybody in the village for sending packages to keep her alive during the Hunger Games. She realizes the futility of running away and instead just plans to be a sweet, girlish airhead during the required Victory Tour, as she and Peeta tour all the districts. Only in Rue's district does she see a few minor signs of rebellion and the brutal way the detractors are punished. And then rumors that a demolished District 13 might still be functioning add only more adrenaline and worry to the story.<br /><br />But then the Capitol plans something more sinister - two winners from each district must compete in the Quarter Quell, with only one ultimate winner, again. Having another Hunger Game, only with more contestants seemed like an author cop-out, but at the same time, Collins wrote about them so well, I knew that I would enjoy them with shock and horror. Kat and Peeta each compete against 2 competitors from 11 other districts, again with only one surviving winner. But this time, Kat has one mission - Keep Peeta Alive.<br /><br />Kat's so curmudgeonly and so grumpy, with a fierce love that barely shines through her rough and practical ways. As she's about to enter the arena for what she believes is the last time, \\"My prep team. My foolish, shallow, affectionate pets, with their obsessions with feathers and parties, nearly break my heart with their goodbye. It's certain from Venia's last words that we all know I won't be returning. Does the whole world know it? I wonder. I look at Cinna. He knows, certainly.

I will heartily recommend this to every one I know and will be given as a gift to all my loved ones. When a book changes your life and makes you rethink how you will spend the rest of your time here this is pretty profound. This book was truly a gift and gets me excited for tomorrow. Amazing thought provoking book.
0375507256|5.0|I read this book about 5 years ago when it was hot off the press, and am always telling friends to read it.  It's such an ingenious work of fiction.  I had so much pleasure reading this book.  The writing is fantastic, like 5 writers in one book, all great, and all the same writer.  Savory, page-turning, and super-intelligent.  Awesome to the very last sentence.
B0000009RT|4.0|This 1995 release has excellent sound quality. As my first introduction to anything by Frank Zappa, I have to say that I found the music mostly pleasant and accessible pop. There are 1950s influences at times (do wop kind of stuff). Some songs bear an influence from British rock group Cream, it seems to me. In any case, this album is FUN, but it does get experimental...veers from pop to jazzy stuff. Some of it is silly and some of it is serious. Overall this is a good listen. CD runs to 60:29 minutes.        The best track:        Help, I'm a rock - a hypnotic jam. Sort of a simple, funky jazzy rhythm to it. Cool song, which features the piano. A fun track with silly lyrics. Has some cool scatting too. Later you hear what may be intended to sound like demon groans (or maybe that's just me!). I could see people baulking at this kind of material...you do need a certain sense of humour to appreciate it.        The next best songs (on 2nd listen):        Any way the wind blows - pleasant song with nice bassy parts. Has some quick note picking on the guitar. Glassy percussion. Catchy.    You're probably wondering why I'm here - catchy, especially the chorus part. Glassy percussion. Bassy. Has harmonies. You hear something that sounds like a kazoo one time, I think. Good.    Trouble everyday - has a bluesy groove, with good lead guitar...it sounds jangly...there's a guitar lick which I like which reminds me of David Bowie's later song \\"Rebel rebel\\". Harmonica  features. Also good is the doubled up vocals. Lyrics aren't absurd here...they have a social conscience, like the opening track on this album.        Most experimental tracks:         It can't happen here - a capella either side of a jazzy interlude. Track is a vocal soundscape which does amuse at times. E.g. the intro is funny...in a desperate sort of way. You hear instruments like cymbals and the piano. Hmmm...the phrase \\"acdc\\" is used here. Only mention that because my favourite rock band of all time is AC/DC.     The return of the son of monster magnet - a monster 12:17 minutes in length. This is pretty much the band only playing for their own pleasure, without regard to any listening audience (Captain Beefheart's \\"Trout mask replica\\" takes that philosophy to its extreme...a fact which alienated me from the album...but some people rate it extremely highly. Zappa gets the balance right on his album though, I think). Maybe you could describe the intro to this song as Beach Boys in Hell (maybe I'm thinking of Beach Boys tracks like \\"Wild honey\\"...set in Hell).  Spacey sounds, experimental sounds. Jungle rhythms. Singing as a form of jazz music. Chimp noises and sexual noises (\\"Help, I'm a rock\\" first introduces these elements into the album). Jazzy at times too, with the piano and cymbals featuring. Many may find this last track, especially, self-indulgent. Personally, I found it less antagonizing than the worst excesses of \\"Trout mask replica\\"...in fact, there is hardly anything on that album which is appealing as anything on this album. Reviewed TMR at this site.        The Cream sounding tracks:        I ain't got no heart - has a nice, Creamy type mood and vocals. Vocalist sounds like the Other singer in Cream (not clear on who that would be...Baker?). Brassy, dual vocals. Catchy.    How could I be such a fool? - Vocals reminiscent of Cream again. Pleasant sound, with with nice lead guitar bits. . NIce brassy parts...trumpet? Guitar is nicely melodic. Interesting percussion...xylophone? Cymbals and some glassy sounding percussion features.    I'm not satisfied - piano, brassy at times. Occasional harmonising. Guitar picks notes...nice lead guitar playing at times. Xylophone type percussion features again. Backing vocals bring to mind that Cream singer, I think.          1950s influenced songs:        Go cry on somebody else's shoulder - a 50s style tribute...do wop, Sha Na Na harmonising type territory...good contrast between bass vocals and high end vocals. Metal instrument percussion. Might be the first track where the singer tries on a Mexican type accent. Nice song.    Wowie zowie - 1950s type sound...the song title is sung to the tune of Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons' classic \\"Sherry\\" for the outro. Nice xylophone playing...or maybe it's a glockenspiel...dunno...something of the sort. Poppy music with harmonising; quirky lyrics and singing, at times. Another fun track.        Distinctly 1960s sounding song:        Motherly love - guitar sounds a little jangly, in that 1960s style  (there are lots of examples of this sound in 1960s compilations of now rare songs...e.g. Nuggets, Back from the grave, and Pebbles). You hear a kazoo type instrument again, at times. Metal percussion also features again.         The rest:        Hungry freaks, daddy - pointed social commentary with the lyrics and dual vocals at times. Good guitar playing...seems biased to the left hand speaker...that kind of faux stereo effect found during this era. Singers have an \\"average Joe\\" vibe to them. Sort of catchy song, with nice metal percussion appearing on this, the first track of the album.    Who are the brain police - moody music with quirky lyrics and dual vocals. Nice bassy sound. You do get discordant noises at times. Kazoo appears...for the first, but not last time on this album, I think.    You didn't try to call me - pleasant, with sort of country sounding lead guitar at times. Dual vocals sometimes. That Mexican type accent reappears again here...lyrics are amusing at the end.  Brassy at times.         Recommendations:      I'm not a huge fan of Cream, but I do think that \\"Wheels of fire\\" is an all time classic album (reviewed here at this site by me).    If you like more experimental type stuff, the extreme end of that would be Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band's \\"Trout mask replica\\".   In the arty but pleasant realm or punk, I like Wire's first three albums...their 3rd is their best, in my view, but no longer punk.  For jazzy type punk-rock, I like the debut of Australian punk pioneers Radio Birdman, which is \\"Radios appear\\". They were fans of The Stooges. \\"Fun house\\" by The Stooges does get jammy/jazzy for the second half of it.

B0002O7XW2|3.0|This is really a love story but since it's based on a book by Stephen King you aleady know that the love is dark and dangerous. In every high school there are couple of kids who are treated badly by the tribe. Arnie Cunningham is a sweet, smart kid but the local bullies are making his life hell. He has two things going for him: his imagination and his best friend, Dennis, a genuinely nice kid who is on the football team and protects him.  Arnie finds a Plymouth Fury and falls in love. The car's name is Christine and she's alive. No reason why, she just is. She talks to Arnie telepathicaly and through her radio. When she plays Johnny Ace's Pedging My Love and Arnie sighs and lays his head on her steering wheel the two are irrevocably wedded. The actor's voice changes whenver he's speaking to Christine, it becomes soft and affectionate.  Her music, when they are alone is a playlist of love songs. It's and intense relationship.    Arnie gives Christine his life, she gives devotion, protection and  one heck of a makeover. His skin improves and he no longer needs his glassses. He goes from looking like a hopeless geek to a combination of James Dean and Marlon Brando in THe Wild Ones. He attracts and takes for himselt the queen of the school, Leah. The actress playing Leah is not very good. She says her lines and that's about all I can say for her. Frankly, nobody's acting, except for Keith Gordon as Arnie, is very good. Acting is not what makes this movie.  The relationsip, the building suspense that exlodes into terror, the music both soundtrack and John Carpenter's score make the movie and does it fairly well.    Christine tolerates Leah for one hot minute but when it looks like Arnie's affection for her is getting too strong the car causes her to almost choke to death. She also settles some scores with the local punks. Anybody who crossed Arnie is getting burnt, squished, crushed and turned into roadkill. Finally Dennis and Leah try to pull Arnie from Christine's spell and end the killing. They succeed, sort of.  Other than the poor acting of the supporting cast, there are a few nitpicks. The leader of the bullies looks about 30, what the heck is he doing in highschool? The ending is too far from what was in the book and is too weak. The detective focuses on Arnie but has nothing to make his investigation legal. This isn't a great movie. It's a darkened basement TV movie and that's okay. I had fun with it.

I learned more about symbols that I really wanted to, but inorder to get through the book and find the answers at the end of it you have to read through the symbols.<br /><br />This is an outstanding book which is fascinating to the end.  Some books seem to quit on you before the end or the last few chapers are just add ons.  Not in this case. Is does get a little dry towards the end but that ismore than made up for by the interest formed in reading the book and following the plot.<br /><br />Mystery readers will enjoy this book.<br /><br />J.

0743455967|5.0|Not only does this book clearly explain what makes a good writer- and what a writer must do to reach that point. (Read.Write.Read.Write repeat)It also is a window into the life of Stephen King. A must have for all aspiring writers- in any genre- and any King fanatic.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I loved this movie!  We saw Star Trek at the theatre and had to have the movie to watch at home.  I grew up watching the Star Trek series as reruns after school.     The movie happened whenKirk and Spock joined Star Fleet.  The actor who portrayed Spock did a great job! It was fun to see all the characters as they supposedly looked in their twenties. The outtakes are fun to watch too. Special effects are FANTASTIC ! Great Prices at AMAZON, save a lot of money, delivered to the door! Trekkie Fan

0688014291|5.0|I just finished reading the One Minute Manager, and I loved it!  In fact, I've started adapting and reading it for my 6-year old.  This should be required reading for every kid in school - it would help them to develop success strategies early in life that could follow them forever.  As an adult, it is very difficult to change, even when confronted with an excellent idea - like the One Minute Manager.  I am, however, going to work on this concept and try to implement it on a daily basis as I work with my staff, my child, my husband, my church, etc.  I'll hardly know how to act with all the extra time!<br /><br />Thanks!
B000001FN3|5.0|What can i add to the other glowing reviews here? This LP (as that is the format i first purchased it in) is simply a masterpiece. As a die-hard Poe fan this work manages to enscapulate the spirit of the works perfectly. It is an album I listen to at least once a month and I never tire of it. And, in fact, depending on my mood often discover new nuances in it.<br /><br />Classic!
B001AQMBKA|5.0|I had previously bought all of the seasons of Lost on DVD but I love Lost so much that I dedided that I would like to see the show on  the High Def of Blu-Ray and I have to say it was worth it.

B001O9CEGY|5.0|Taken at face value, And Then There Were None may as well have been the basis of the 1985 movie Clue. Of course, as funny that movie was, this novel was anything but.<br /><br />But the premise is very similar. Strangers made to come together in a remote place by an invitation from an anonymous sender. However this is where the two works of fiction diverge. The movie Clue revolves around a plot with characters who have received the same letter/invitation (as in verbatim). In And Then There Were None however, each letter is eerily suited to a particular person. Some were enticed by the prospect of a good time or the promise of meeting old acquaintances (as what they have been wanting to do or have), others were lured by financial opportunities (as was their pressing need); whilst others still had vague motivations for coming.<br /><br />The author is unrelenting in building the suspense - from the first bits in the train/carriage ride bearing the arriving guests - up to the climax. Snatches of thoughts from each character make it helpful for the reader (to a certain extent) to pin down which is which. There's the judge who can lie still as a stone but whose pale eyes are razor sharp, always taking everything in. The self-righteous and religious fanatic middle-aged woman whose demeanor is rarely ruffled. The younger female who looks sensible but whose thoughts are haunted and chaotic. The general whose disdain for the brash, younger generation is hard to miss. The doctor whose seeming contentment with his career is nevertheless shadowed by a past controversy. And then others more whose presence in Indian Island certainly make the group a strange mix of persons.<br /><br />The first solid chilling clue is the presence of the Ten Little Indian Boys rhyme set in each of the guest's bedroom. (I had to write it all down as a guide...No, really. It's a requirement)<br /><br />The guests themselves have barely been reluctant acquaintances upon arrival when a strange, disembodied voice blasts over the whole drawing room where they have all retired after dinner. And then the chills creep in all over again.<br /><br />Each of those present is accused of murder.<br /><br />Well then of course one just has to read on. Because that's the beauty of Agatha Christie novels. It's all up-front murder but the mastery lies in her exposition. Who and how was it all done?<br /><br />I again thought that it might be the same as Clue, in which the presence of deadly weapons is a silent command that all characters finish each other off.<br /><br />But no. In this novel, the characters have no reason to kill each other. And yet all of them, because of those accusations, deserve to die.<br /><br />And if this is not your first Agatha Christie, then I guess my saying that it's useless to make any guesses is understandable.<br /><br />Just sit back and let the narrative do the work for you.<br /><br />And if you still find yourself guessing every so often, I can't blame you. And that's why I'm loving this author.drawing room where they have all retired after dinner. And then the chills creep in all over again.    Each of those present is accused of murder.

0307394549|5.0|Received Martha Stewart's Cookies as a gift last weekend. Given that I attend or hold a cookie baking party every winter, I've made a few cookies in my day, and still the recipes in this book caught my eye enough to tempt me into baking 4 different (and I mean different!) recipes already. The book itself is gorgeous. The table of contents is pictures of cookies arranged by texture, which is both innovative and dead useful, not to mention drool worthy.<br /><br />Three of the four trial recipes worked out pretty easily, but the pistachio tuiles were problematic to bake and form because I didn't know what to look for.  If you make them, don't use an airbake pan, I recommend lightly buttering up the silpat or other non-stick surface for insurance, and making sure the cookies get pretty brown before approaching with a spatula. Make them small so they're easy to handle.  If you undercook them or make them too big so only half cooks at a time, you'll get to eat a lot of ugly rejects if you can get them off the pan.  If you have more patience and wait for them to thoroughly cook, you'll have a hit cookie.  My trial tasters cleared me out.  (Also, I used a coffee grinder reserved for baking -no coffee allowed- to grind my pistachios finer and it worked great.)<br /><br />I can also recommend the Earl Grey cookies. It's so odd to put actual tea in a food!  Again the non-coffee grinder enabled deliciousness.  I'm about 2/3 of the way through the batch with the final third resting in a paper towel tube in the freezer ready to be baked on demand.  I've never seen this idea of tea in cookies before, so that's why it was the first thing I tried and it was easy.<br /><br />The Coconut Swirl Brownies were terrific, even though I subbed 2/3c coconut milk +1/3c sugar boiled down to 1/3c for the evaporated milk.  It worked great but splattered everywhere when boiling it down.  Reviews were again raves, although one suggested adding a quarter tsp cayenne, which I might do next time.  Moist but still light and delicious.<br /><br />Lastly, I halved the Apricot Window tart recipe and made it in an 8\\" round springform pan.  Worked great. I piped the topping on in circles with radial lines like a spiderweb instead of a square grid. (will try to upload photo).  Don't know yet if it tastes as good as it looks but the uncooked batter was buttery goodness.<br /><br />So:  recipes 4 of 4 for deliciousness, 3 of 4 for \\"reasonable\\" to do straight out of the gate for an experienced baker, and probably 2 of 4 were both tasty and easy for a beginner.  That's actually a superb record for any cookbook so I have high hopes that anyone can find at least one or two cookies in here that they will love, and that they might not find anywhere else.  Add in the delightful images, and this cookbook is a winner.
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|Received the Doctor Who complete specials right on time.  It is a excellent dvd set.  \\"Who\\" would want to miss David Tennent!
B002XMGGK6|4.0|I thought this movie was almost perfect except for one thing...the ending. It sucked big time IMO....My sister and I went \\"That's it?\\" as far as how they closed the movie. I think they should've had Clyde manage to escape which would leave the possibility open for a sequel.  I'm glad Jamie and Gerry switched roles because if Jamie had played Clyde, it wouldn't have the same impact, it would've just been another black person in jail movie.  Gerry is amazing as Clyde still feel his pain even after he starts his killing spree.  This is not for the squeamish. A true thriller.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|The most recent BBC adaptations of Jane Autsen's novels have been a bit of hit and miss (very disappointed with the latest \\"Persuasion\\"), so I was very pleased to find the new \\"Emma\\" a complete hit.  From the casting to the locations to the costumes to the music, this is a true delight.  My husband even loved it!  The extras on the DVD are also a plus.  I loved the interview with Sir Michael Gambon (Mr. Woodhouse), and found the discussion about the music fascinating.<br /><br />I was especially pleased with the chemestry between Romola Garai and Jonny Lee Miller as Emma and Mr. Nightly.  And Ms. Garai has such an expressive face that she made Emma both a comedic masterpiece and a real person.  Michael Gambon seems to be making all the rounds as the elderly British gentleman of choice recently, but I hope that we see more of him.  Bravo!

B0030BYWKU|1.0|Jason DeRulo is a singer/songwriter from Miami that has done various work for other artists.  Despite not knowing much about this \\"new\\" artist I decided to take a chance on his album.  Every now and then  when I do that I find a diamond in the rough (KARINA comes to mind instantly).  However, after listening to this debut album, it seems that I missed his bus.    I'm not trying to be funny but I don't like a single song on this album.  Not one.  Apparently the song Whatcha Say has been certified double platinum (my ears tell me otherwise because I don't see how or why that's happened...but...).  I just don't hear it.    Also his music is like a cross between techno, trance, and pop.  Ballads which give DeRulo an opportunity to show off his voice are non existent  Most of these songs sound like Pitbull forgot to rap on these songs and he just picked them up mixed with David Guetta & AKON B-Sides.  DeRulo lacks identity as his songs sound like other people's songs.  DeRulo's voice is good but sounds similar to a certain light skinned woman beater that shall not be named.  I saw a video for one of the songs as well and he actually dances like him too.    Not to be harsh but I don't think Jason DeRulo can sustain a solo career unless he comes up with some better songs.  Otherwise he should just continue to songwrite and produce.  1 star.
B002XTXFU8|5.0|i thought this was a great movie read his book/books for more detail i like this guy and the system has not treated him properly hes not a bad guy funny insightful smart and oh yes hes a mad man and i love it he needs a fair shake like i said watch the movie if you like it read some of his books especially the book this movie is based on p.s. Tom Hardy does a great job in this movie
0375842209|5.0|I don't think I would do this book justice in just a few words. It made me cry, laugh, think about those important to me, and pray for an ending that is different than what I knew it would be. What could you expect when the narrator is death? Although death consistently interrupts with hints of what happens in the end, it is still heartbreaking when it comes. I'm a little sad that the book is over now.    A young girl is about to be placed in foster care. Her mother is too poor to take care of Leisel and her brother, so she is taking them to Munich to be given over to a foster family. On the train ride, Leisel's brother dies. Then she is handed off to a woman who yells and cusses at her and an accordion player who seems to allow his wife to run things. Leisel's life begins to change for the better as her foster father begins to teach her to read and her friendship grows with the next door neighbor, Rudy. Words revolutionize Leisel. She first is powerful against them, but then becomes powerful by using them. Her reading inspires healing during bomb raids, sickness, and melts the heart of death himself. The connection of books end up her savior in the end.    I can't imagine anyone not liking this book. It does begin slowly, but the characters all become to grow on you. The triumphs and failures of each of the main characters move the reader as if they were part of the scenes. It is truly remarkable how much I was sucked into this book. I cried at least four times even though I knew what was going to happen well before it happened. Death attempts to make all of the readers comfortable with the idea of destruction that will rip Leisel's world apart, but it didn't help me. I know this review has been all over the place, but it's because there is so much that I would want to say that I can't get it out in a logical sequence. All I can tell you is that you NEED to read this book!
B002DYKP8S|5.0|Is a great movie to begin with. It is even better in BR. They did such a great job with the colors in this movie and the BR disc brings them out even more. I just wish I had an LED lit, 120hz HDTV to watch it on. Still looked amazing on the 60hz LCD. I also recommend \\"Fearless\\" on BR as well. Believe it or not, the picture in these two BR movies is some of the best I've seen. Jet Li has always been one of my favorites. I don't buy many BR movies but this one was a must have. If you have not seen the movie, it is a great story and the kung fu action is good (a few crazy parts but overall good).
0061703257|2.0|You know at the beginning it's going to have that kind of twist. But I kept reading thinking no maybe I'll be really surprised.  I would have been impressed if Sixth Sense,  A Beautiful Mind, Secret Window, and countless of other books and movies didn't have the same twist.  The twist is overdone and I was disappointed. Boo the review all you want but it's true. It is an overdone story and way to predictable.  I want to read something with a new never done twist.

B002WCLG48|5.0|I bougth this product just because I was curious, I really wanted to see how an animated production in the halo universe would look like, and I have to say that I am more than satisfied.  Why?  The stories where not Sierra 117 oriented, with the exception of one where he is part of a Spartan Team.   It was very interesting to see the japanese tweaks to the story that made it so interesting.     When you buy and watch this dvd set you have to keep in mind that you are not buying a game, or an anime based on Master Chief.  You have to keep in mind that he is only part of a huge universe with a very deep story that is worth watching.    I strongly suggest this dvd set for those interested to see how the halo universe was concieved and why the covenant and the UNSC where so brutal on their fights.  I ordered the two dvd set because DVD #2 has a documental sort of, that talks about the halo story so far and it was superb.    This is a great product worth to buy.  Kudos to the producers!

0316044938|5.0|The subject matter of the first chapter makes you queasy. But the story is one of hope, set against a dark reality.<br />I love the way Seabold, jumps around in the timeline, it makes the gruesome reality bearable enough to continue. She weaves in the reality of the living with this girl's existence in heaven, like fabric. I also love how she magnifies life through the eyes of the dead, You see life, and death, love and grief is such clarity that's its almost painful as you realize the depth and beauty of the human condition and what we are capable of. As well as where life can and will take you. It flows well. It's beautiful and mesmerizing.
B000002B7O|5.0|Album number two in Ozzy's catalog is considered to be just as crucial in the development of early `80's metal as was the first. Randy Rhoads seems to be have been given more leeway to develop his classical ideas. Many fans prefer `Diary of a Madman' to `Blizzard of Ozz' but I think they are equally great. 1981 must have seen like Ozzy's year as both albums received US release in that year, though `Blizzard' had a UK in Sept. of 1980. `Diary' also started a tradition of leaving off or outright discrediting the many musicians that have played with the Oz over the years as both Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake were present but not accounted for the second album yet the touring band of Rudy Sarzo and Tommy Aldridge appearing on the inner sleeve and back cover credits. Anyway highlights include \\"Over the Mountain\\", \\"Flying High Again\\", `Diary of a Madman\\", \\"Believer\\" and probably the most underrated track in Ozzy's career, the epic ballad \\"You Can't Kill Rock and Roll\\", which is absolutely stunning! Ozzy Osbourne was now a legit rock superstar and he was about to leave Black Sabbath in the dust but in a cruel twist of fate, while touring to support the album, Randy was killed in a plane crash. Ozzy did recover but his music never would have the same magic and with the exception of `No More Tears', no future Ozzy records would sell half as much as the first two. Long live Randy Rhoads, whose genius was unfortunately unfulfilled. I'm born to rock and roll....I'm here to stay....
B001BMXFX0|5.0|The subject matter of the first chapter makes you queasy. But the story is one of hope, set against a dark reality.<br />I love the way Seabold, jumps around in the timeline, it makes the gruesome reality bearable enough to continue. She weaves in the reality of the living with this girl's existence in heaven, like fabric. I also love how she magnifies life through the eyes of the dead, You see life, and death, love and grief is such clarity that's its almost painful as you realize the depth and beauty of the human condition and what we are capable of. As well as where life can and will take you. It flows well. It's beautiful and mesmerizing.
B002XUL6RG|5.0|Hunger is a film with such power and beauty it's really difficult to convey the experience of watching it as to how impressive it really is.  The performance from Michael Fassbender as Bobby Sands is daring and scary, as he literally had to diet until his body became that of a man on a hunger strike.  The added feature with director Steve McQueen brings incredible insight to the art and humanity behind the film.  Without question, a must-see film.
B0012Z361C|4.0|I wish there would have been some English subtitles as most of the concert was in Italian.  Beautiful venue and great singing!
B001HN694K|5.0|I just came back from the cinema with the feeling I want to see this again.  It is not just the expected visual feast, it is a funny film and a fun experience.  I was never bored, and the good acting and script helped a lot with that.  Johnny Depp is very good as The Mad Hatter, Helena Bonham-Carter gets it just right with a crazy Queen, and Matt Lucas made the audience laugh with his chubby Tweedle Twins.  If you have older children, or even if you just want some fun, then see this movie.
B003102JDM|4.0|This is a very specific sort of movie that I can see dividing people's opinions for some time. This film isn't necessarily for fans of Coen Bros. films such as No Country For Old Men or even really Fargo.  It has all of the hallmarks of a good Coen Bros. film, but it has much more in common with Burn After Reading than the films I mentioned.  The downward spiral of the main character is practically its own character, and even though it can be quite funny (even hysterical if you know some things about Jewish culture) it is a film focused on character dialogue and interaction over action and sometimes even plot development. That may sound like a bad thing, but it really isn't.    I found this film to be hysterical, unsettling and brimming with Cohen Bros. charm and style.
B0036EH40Q|5.0|This is a movie I've enjoyed numerous times and will look forward to adding it to my BD Collection - it's truly deserving of Blu Ray treatment.    The casts blends so well and it blows away the Westerns I viewed growing up.  Historically they likely weren't so cool and attractive in reality but they do a job of matching what our minds may have perceived who these folks were in the Wild West.  There's a little bit of everything in this film.    It's sad that a Amazon Reviewer comes into Amazon and trashes a movie because it's not a Directors Cut.  Considering the age of the film now perhaps they had no DC as all the extra content has become expanded with BD capability but he should never have trashed the film because he didn't favor the type of cut - one has nothing to do with the other - if it's not the version you want don't buy it but trashing it with your rating is childish and selfish at best! Others take heed where reviewers abuse their responsibility in posting ratings and his is an abuse of that privilege!
0385532458|3.0|Although I love the author, and have read most of his books, this one left me wondering \\"what is the point?\\"  The stories are situations really, rather than fully developed characters.  While they are believable, they are also depressing, focusing on faults and weaknesses rather than any redeeming qualities.

B00008CLOA|5.0|This Album had a huge impact in so many ways and stil does today. Legendary Psychedelic and Rock and Roll Album.
0802798225|5.0|This book was hot. Elkeles most definitely knew how to write the teenage hormones in this one. Steamy scenes ran rampant but not one of them was distastefully written- something that is hard to do in this genre. Underneath that lust, however, was clear emotion, desire and reasoning- also well spoken.    Things didn't happen instantly or easily for Alex and Brittany in this book- a feature that stands out tremendously. Neither character instantly ignored everything else for the other, despite the strong desire and even when one started to crack, the other stayed firm. This wasn't an easily earned relationship and I fully appreciated it. That single facet is what made this book find a place on my favorites shelf.    As with Leaving Paradise, the chapters alternate in perspective between Alex and Brittany but where that book fell short for me with character development, this one came out swinging. Both characters are as strong as they are vulnerable and Elkeles spared nothing in portraying that. Right from the start, the dissonance between their public personas and their true personalites was clear and instantly, I fell in love with both characters.    Ekleles did a superb job blending the rich, white collar society with the gang life, giving plenty of detail on just how trapped members of the latter can feel. Those contrasts made the final ending of this book even stronger and more memorable. The writing definitely kicked up several notches in this book from Leaving Paradise and though the chapters switched between the characters, they each showed their true ways- I didn't get the impression this was written from one mind trying to imitate two other minds. The characters were speaking, not Elkeles and it came out clear. The diversity factor in this book was also notable, making up a good chunk of the underlying plot and theme.    Alex is definitely a bad boy any girl would love and he slipped into Spanish at just the right times to keep the fire blazing. I most definitely want my own Latino Blood right now if he talks like that and acts like that because the moments when his sweet side showed through were astounding. Brittany became just as appreciable for me and clearly far more than the perfect ice princess she fights to be perceived as.    This ending was well earned and well done, leaving all kinds of warm and fuzzy feelings in me. These characters are strong and memorable, and adding in the action, overall plot and general interaction, this is book is certainly a hit. I give this on 5 stars and will definitely read it again.
B001OQCV2O|3.0|I love a good sci-fi movie.  Throw in an apocalypse and I'm happy.  However, I really do like to have some science fact and realism mixed in there, at least from time to time.  Now don't get me wrong, the special effects were spectacular but when the coast of California fell off into the ocean, there should have been some gigantic tsunami racing across the pacific toward the asian coast, but oddly the tsunami didn't start until later in the movie.  A little bit of a surprise at the end when the solution to save humanity turned out to be one thing when everyone was led to believe something else.  I liked that.
0385737947|5.0|Phenomenal. That pretty much sums up this book because it is one that is just an all around hit from the characters to the writing to the plot. I completely enjoyed this book, falling into it easily. Though it is written it in third person perspective, it focuses on Thomas and if he doesn't know it, we don't know it. We even get inside his head without it actually being in his point of view which is a unique way to write the book.    Thomas' character was an enjoyable one- he starts out confused but quickly pushes past it to try to make things work, find answers, and find his memories. The almost immediate assaults on him only add to his frustration and I think Dashner did a perfect job showing how Thomas fielded all that. He easily could have given up but didn't, even when he was terrified and scared klunkless. Even when he was being completely idiotic, there was still a clear rationale behind his decisions and I was rooting for this character from the start.    The rest of the characters are diverse and entertaining. From sweet, kind hearted, talkative Chuck to irrational, hateful Gally and back to temperamental and egotistical Alby, many of the various personalities show through. Despite there being a fairly large number of important players, Dashner wrote each one with enough detail that I never had to try to figure out who was who. It was all clear and easily to take in, even with several being introduced from the start.    The plot itself was brilliant and astounding. There was hardly anything that I was able to see coming in this book and even when I had some ideas, they were easily wrong. Things were revealed at a great pace, keeping me interested without ever dragging things out or taking away the mystery appeal. I wanted to find out the truth and some answers as much as Thomas did. The world created is original but I could picture much of it easily since it is so based on the world we know now. Even the Grievers themselves were something that I could envision thanks to Dashner's writing and great use of imagery.    If all that wasn't enough, the ending was a perfect cliff hanger to leave me salivating for the next book in this trilogy, coming out this fall. I can't even imagine where things are going to go from here- this book has left innumerable possibilities for where things are going to go. Other than knowing there's more to come, I simply cannot think of what Dashner has in store for his readers and his characters.    This one gets 5 stars easily and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes action type books. It is intriguing, extremely well written, with some strong characters. Even at the end of this book, there is still a large amount we don't know even about the characters which is something I think is fantastic in books- it just isn't the same when you learn everything in the first book of a set. This is a book that would make for a great movie with plenty of action to keep it paced.    After reading this book, I have a new appreciation for the cover. It isn't immediately grabbing, but it shows the Doors that close every night to lock the Gladers in with the Maze extending behind it. This isn't just some hedge maze- it is massive in size with extremely high walls and the cover helps reinforce its size. The title is also very perfect for this and if I am correct, the next book is called The Scorch which seems just as simplistically fitting.
0399237720|5.0|I love the size of the book.  Its not super big but its not way to small.  Its a perfect size.  The size brings out the pictures in the book.  Would recomend this to any one with kids.
B00127RAJY|3.0|I've done this DVD 3 times so far but I can't seem to do it two days in a row because of how SORE it makes me.... I guess that means it's doing it's job? It does get your heart rate up and Jillian is not nearly as annoying as a lot of the other trainers out there, so I'm happy with my purchase.  I wish it had more than one workout per level, but once you're comfortable with the work-out you can put some music on to drown out all the dailogue so that you don't have to hear Jillian say the same things over and over again.
B0035J6TA8|2.0|The concept of Peter Gabriel's latest album is a most intriguing one.  The pop icon has delivered covers of songs by 12 artists ranging from contemporary (Bon Iver, Arcade Fire, The Magnetic Fields) to classic (David Bowie, Neil Young, Paul Simon), and for each artist that he has selected they in turn will contribute a cover of one of his songs to a companion album due sometime later this year.  To make matters even more interesting, the songs that have been selected are lesser known fare (aside from David Bowie's Heroes) and Gabriel has opted to tackle them sans guitar and drums.  As he explains in the liner notes to this album, he is interested in interpretting these songs and putting his signature on them as opposed to simply replicating the original compositions.<br /><br />After listening to the album, though, I felt largely dissapointed.  Each of the songs here has been reinterpreted and is in no way a mere copy of the original.  Strings, piano, horns and symphonic arrangements make each of these songs sound brand new while Gabriel's vocals are excellent throughout.  Yet the whole affair is surprisingly boring.  Despite the time and meticulous care that went into each of these compositions, they feel cold and distant.  Emotions that are meant to be evoked never are and the the songs often feel excruciatingly slow and tuneless.<br /><br />I applaud Gabriel for his effort but the bottom line is that the album is more interesting in theory than in practice.  Hopefully the companion album due out later this year will yield more fruitful results.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|Sally Hawkins played the role of Anne Elliot beautifully. You feel her regret and ache for her as she longs to undo the choices of her past. When she encounters her former love she has little hope of salvaging what was lost, but she is determined not to be persuaded by others and to follow her heart. This is another great Jane Austen love story.     Anybody else notice the weird camera shots where Sally stares right at you? Kind of creepy, but the rest of the film was put together very well.
0061120073|5.0|I am more than satisfied with my purchase. The book arrived in the time frame specified and in the condition noted.
0307454541|4.0|Finally I was able to land my hands on a good thriller and once I finished this book I bought its sequel (girl who played with fire). Full credits to the author. I am taking away one star because at times it gets verbose (so you need to be know how to skim) and that the last 50 pages of the book are really a stretch since the mystery was already solved.
0143038419|4.0|I read a bunch of reviews before purchasing the book. A friend highly recommended the book as well. I had read one review that mentioned Elizabeth being selfish and complaining a lot. My response to that review is that Elizabeth is supposed to be selfish! She is on a journey of self-discovery! She isn't traveling to save the poor in 3rd world countries. She specifically traveled to write the book about her own personal experience on how she wanted to figure out her place in life and how to heal a broken heart. This book wasn't meant to be a self-help book for others necessarily. She wanted to figure out her own problems and the reader could probably relate in one way or another. I also considered how she did some complaining, but who cares?? Again, that's part of the process towards how someone learns and grows. People fight the truth and reality and on that journey, the learning process can be tough because you are discovering new things about yourself which is why Elizabeth complained a lot. But notice by the end of the book she was A LOT more calm and relieved and satisfied. That's why it's such a great book, because you start to really learn and grow with Elizabeth and feel that sigh of relief in the end. My favorite part was in the end when she talks about the tree wanting the acorn to grow into itself. It really made sense of the book as a whole. The one reason why I gave 4 stars and not 5 stars was because i did find myself browsing over some overly-descriptive thoughts or hypothetical ideas that didn't have anything specifically to do with the actual storyline - i felt the same about DaVinci Code - which i loved too, but would have again only given 4 stars for a similar writing style reason.
B000JIHP88|1.0|This mobile didn't even last two weeks. It stopped turning around when the motor stopped working. When I called Fisher Price they were not helpful at all. They wanted me to pay to return it to them and then wait 6 to 8 weeks for the replacement to show up in the mail. I fought them about it an they agreed to pay for the shipping. Now I have to wait 6 to 8 weeks for the replacement and hope that one works. By then my son missed out on so much time he could have been enjoying it. He loved it for the two weeks it worked and then I had to take it away from him to get it replaced. It's so upsetting. Reading reviews for all the mobiles I find that the motors seem to brake on all of them. I bought my son a toy aquarium from Disney's Baby Einstein that lights up, plays music and ocean sounds and has movement as a replacement for the mobile. He really likes that. I would recommend buying something like that and not spend the money on a mobile with a motor. A stationary colorful mobile that gives a baby something to look at above there head would be nice also. It would be cheaper than buying one with a motor and you don't have to deal with the motor braking.
B0002OXVDW|4.0|I know what you're thinking...who would want to watch the 'standard' version of a movie when they can watch the 'original widescreen?'  Well, i've found that to be true in every case...except for all three That's Entertainment movies.  Luckily, these discs are double-sided, with the widescreen on one side and the standard on the other.<br /><br />Typically, a 'standard' or 'full-screen' version of a film is obtained by taking the original widescreen presentation, zooming in on the center of the image, and eliminating the sides to make it fill up the screen on an old-school 4:3 CRT television.  If you're a movie buff, then you know how annoying that practice is, as you lose picture information off to the sides, and sometimes on the top.<br /><br />But in this ONE instance, i strenuously recommend watching the 'standard' version side for all the movies.  The reason is this...the vast majority of these old musicals that are showcased on this box set were originally shot with an aspect ratio of 1.33:1 (4:3).  That was the old screen standard of most movies up until the 1950's, when little by little, more movies began to switch over to filming in widescreen ratios.  It's also why televisions were that same size ratio (4:3) for more than 50 years.  They were just matching the movie studios' frame ratio at that time.<br /><br />When the studios came out with VHS/DVD versions of their movies, they were often released in the 'standard' or 'full-screen' versions as described above.  So, the standard version is basically changing a new movie to fit on an old TV.  But with the widescreen versions of That's Entertainment, they're doing the opposite.  They've changed an old movie to fit on a new TV.  Many of the shots in the widescreen version of these films were cropped on the top or bottom to change the shape of the image to fit on a newer, widescreen TV.  There are many scenes where the image is cut off right at the top of somebody's head, so it will fill up a widescreen TV.  Often times, there's a lot of extra stuff going on there that the DVD has now cut out of the image, just to conform with the standards of newer TV's.  Often times, the picture was zoomed in so much that it felt really crowded, with no deep visual field for the context of the scene in the movie.<br /><br />That said, it DOES mean that any genuine widescreen images will appear with letterboxes on all 4 sides of the image.  But if you are a film buff, and want to see the clips of these old films as they were intended to be seen, do yourself and watch the 'standard' side of the disc.  If you don't you'll end up watching some very doctored cut ups from scenes.<br /><br />So, my advice?  Watch all three movies in their STANDARD definition cases, so you can take advantage of seeing the ENTIRE movie, as the directors intended them.<br /><br />I hope i was able to help some folks.ot of extra stuff going on there that the DVD has now cut out of the image, just to conform with the standards of newer TV's.

B002XUL6RG|2.0|I wasn't impressed with this movie.  It takes more than blood, feces, urine, and starvation to impress me.  In a nutshell, the makers of the movie used Bobby Sands and the hunger strike to make a brutal and disgusting movie that would receive its high marks on shock value alone.  In other words, you're guaranteed to see plenty of gut wrenching scenes, such as a janitor sweeping up urine for 5 minutes, a man using a high pressure sprayer to gradually clean smeared feces off the wall, bloody bed sores, naked men beating each other up, people being beaten to death, vomitting, spitting, masturbation, and Bobby Sands' starving body.  If you are impressed by uncompromising visual effects and these scenes still impress you, then maybe you'll like the movie.    However, if you're like me, you're not easily shocked by such things, you'll probably find the movie to be boring.  Because aside from the shock value in the scenes that I described, there is nothing to this movie.    When used effectively, especially in a movie that is based on a true story like the 1981 hunger strike, the brutal events that took place in the prison maze CAN be used to make one heck of an inspiring and moving film.  Unfortunately, this did not occur in \\"Hunger.\\"  It is shock value and brutal visual scenes WITHOUT a story line, WITHOUT character development, WITHOUT dialog and ultimately, WITHOUT emotion and meaning.    Here is why:  - the movie does not do enough to put the hunger strike in context, all of the emotion and desperation that was attached to the 1981 hunger strike is shockingly absent in this film.  Rather than context and story development, the makers of the film tried so squeeze as many visually shocking scenes into the movie as possible.  It left little time to actually develop the plot.   - the character development is poor.  There are only a few characters so there was an ample opportunty to develop them deeply and with detail.  However, you hardly get to know any of them.  Dialogis almost absent and when it is present, it is only shock value dialog, vulgarity, sarcasm, and cynism.  -The ending is very abrupt.  If you actually watch the movie, you'll see how the abrupt ending makes sure that even the small amount of drama and emotion that was left, is stolen.  You'll be bored by the time the movie ends, but you'll still be expecting the makers of the film to be able to produce some sort of lasting emotion.  They fail.    The makers of the film had the luxury of a very dramatic event and had the opportunity to make a great movie.  But they cheapened the 1981 hunger strikes by only using them to create a shock value movie, devoid of any plot or meaning.

B00009W0U4|3.0|LET ME SAY THIS UP FRONT - if you are the type of person who is squeamish or easily offended by material in film then you may want to avoid this movie.<br /><br />With that said, I have to confess that the first time I watched this movie was about 5 years ago. I went into the movie \\"UNKNOWING\\" about what was to occur. At that time I had recently just become an admirer of MONICA BELLUCCI and VINCENT CASSEL. So as you can imagine I was \\"Offended\\" at the controversial scene. (Keep in mind, at the time I had heard nothing about this movie so I didn't know that scene was coming.)<br /><br />It took me 5 years to get up the courage to watch the movie again. Why did I watch the movie again? The answer is simple; I gained a whole new appreciation for foreign films, foreign actors, as well as underrated cinematography. Plus I have met just too many people who talk about \\"freedom of expression\\" through Music & Movies, YET those same people will be the FIRST to oppose sexual content in a movie.<br /><br />I think movies like this film, KIDS, LUST CAUTION, BROKE BACK MOUNTAIN, and other films with \\"Controversial\\" material should always be seen. But most people don't watch movies to \\"Appreciate\\" them. Unfortunately they watch movies to take their mind away from the daily B.S. of life. So instead people usually watched dumbed-down flicks like DUDE WHERE'S MY CAR just to pass the time and thus they don't have to THINK.<br /><br />Either way, I found this movie to be entertaining. But it is interesting for only 1 viewing. I tried to find value in the cinema techniques and of course it was nice seeing how real life husband and wife Monica Belluci and Vincent Cassel continue to make movies together.<br /><br />Is this a good family film to watch during Thanksgiving Dinner? ABSOLUTELY NOT. HECK NO!<br /><br />Is this a decent movie worth watching during Valentines Day with your boyfriend/girlfriend?  PROBABLY NOT (Trust me on that)<br /><br />Is it worth checking out due to it's controversy & having a place in cinematic history? YES - But be warned that if you can't handle the dark side of the most devious parts of human behavior then you will be greatly offended and disturbed.<br />(For Open Minded Audiences ONLY)t be warned that if you can't handle the dark side of the most devious parts of human behavior then you will be greatly offended and disturbed.

B00275EGWY|5.0|wow.just finished watching this film about an hour ago,and i'm still trying to put it into words.it's basically about an elite military bomb squad unit in Iraq,whose job is made tougher because they are still very much in a combat situation.this a very powerful moving experience.riveting right to the last frame.nail biting suspense.great acting.sometimes the quite moments speak louder and more clearly than any words can.the movie is very well constructed.its all so eloquent,like a poem,a ballet.the running time may just be shy of one hundred and thirty minutes,but it sure doesn't feel that long.i could watch this film again without hesitation.war themed movies are not everyone's cup of tea obviously,but if you are a fan of the genre,you owe it to yourself to check this film out.i haven't seen a film this good in a long time.for me,The Hurt Locker is a 5/5

B003102JDM|4.0|You fervent movie buffs all know by now that the Coen Brothers grew up Jewish in Minnesota. They 'know' Minnesota to the bone; they proved that in \\"Fargo\\", still my favorite among their films for its deep understanding of the Minnesota conviction that decency will prevail over depravity, even if only by naive luck. But I was born in Minnesota and spent part of my childhood there, so I have an insider's response to that depiction. The Coen Brothers' films about the Deep South and Southern California are satires from the point of view of a disrespectful outsider. Those films are uproariously funny and probably objectionable to the victims of their satire. The Coen Brothers also 'know' the lifestyles of American Jews to the bone, and I can testify to their authenticity, being married to a nice Jewish girl from Beverly hills, with a large Jewish kindred that has begun, after thirty years, to forget to notice that I'm not Jewish.<br /><br />The 'Minnesota' touches in \\"A Serious Man\\" were subtly satirical, though the humor may have been too \\"in-group\\" for anyone who lives within a few hours drive of an ocean. I laughed out loud at every appearance of Larry Gopnik's 'goyishe' neighbor.<br /><br />The portrayal of the Gopnik family and its insular Jewish community? Was it satirical or was it as 'serious' as Larry Gopnik tried to be? Ay, there's the rub! In many ways, it was devastatingly serious, a bluntly realistic depiction. My wife and I could identify each character in the film with someone in her family. And my wife's relatives, especially the older generation, hated this film, were offended by it, considered it a betrayal. In the film, all of humanity is either Jewish or goyish, and the goyim scarcely matter. Well, it's fair to say that many Jews of my acquaintance do think that way. After the most recent LA earthquake, for instance, I saw a headline in The Jewish Times: \\"Massive Earthquake in Northridge: Four Jewish Homes Damaged.\\" But don't all ethnic and/or religious groups think that way? Do African-Americans or Chinese-Americans ever NOT notice who is and who isn't? Of course, that insularity is one of the themes of \\"A Serious Man\\" and the Coen Brothers don't refrain from mocking it fiercely. But one gets the feeling, in this film, that the subject is too immanent, too raw, for their usual absurdist humor. A quasi-insider like me will laugh, but uncomfortably.<br /><br />The other, even more serious theme of \\"A Serious Man\\" is the question of God's Providence for Man. Mathematics Professor Larry Gopnik, whose academic niche seems to be the 'proving of uncertainty', is going through a rough patch of life, a melange of minor annoyances and major catastrophes. The script implies that Gopnik has been a perfunctory Jew, one of the majority (I think) who identify with the culture and cling to the community but who are not 'serious' about their belief in God. (Or should I use another holy name? Y-hw-h. Ein Sof. Adonai.) His troubles - his tsuris - compel Larry Gopnik to seek advice and consolation from his Jewish world, specifically from his various Rabbis, none of whom has anything but platitudes and evasions to offer. Things do not get better for Larry in this film. This is no resolution, no intervention, unless one can be content to suppose that Larry is really under a curse, that Adonai has a grudge against him. For hapless farshlugener Larry, life has become just one d+mn thing after another.<br /><br />Is the film funny? Yes, I found it funny, but short of hilarious. The Brothers may have found themselves being too serious in trying to treat both sides of their identity - Minnesotans and Jews - in one script.<br /><br />Then is the film serious? Frankly, I have a hard time taking that question of God's Providence seriously. I haven't had the least doubt of the answer since I was nine or ten years old. But I'm sure that people who do take the question seriously will regard The Coen Brothers' treatment of it as superficial andunoriginal.

B000F3UAFC|5.0|A beautiful period piece richly packed with authentic costumes from the 1930's, beautiful locations, and great acting.    The title \\"A Good Woman\\" comes from a line in Oscar Wilde's play entitled \\"Lady Windemere's Fan\\" and it is true to Wilde's play with very small additons or changes that leave the original plot intact. For instance, Wilde's play takes place in the later part of the 19th century while \\"A Good Woman\\" takes place in the 1930's. But it is a timeless play and could even have been remade in today's time period.    Helen Hunt plays the part of a scandulous woman who has \\"been around the block\\" and who has run out of wealthy married men to sustain her lifestyle in America. Her acting is very well done as is that of all the other characters.  Helen's character, sells what jewelry she has left, buys a new trouseau and heads to the Italian coast to mingle with the wealthy there in the hope of upgrading her situation.  Those she comes in involved with, make for an intriguing story.    After seeing it on TCM, when it was in progress, I knew that I had to have it.  I am very happy that I purchased it and, if you are one who likes period pieces, with great costumes, beautiful color, actual Italian seaside locations and scenery, you will very much ejoy this dvd and its story.    The resolution, sound and color, are superior. I highly recommend its purchase.  I recieved it carefully packaged, and within a short time after ordering it.
B001FB4W0C|4.0|The Fourth Season of Supernatural is pretty good, but it is starting to get really cheesy! The first three seasons are golden but this fourth season doesn't quite hit the mark. I think it's a good thing the fifth season will be the last one or else it should just be turned into a soap opera.
0385340990|5.0|I  was not sure about this book at first. The letters were tedious at first and I was about to give up on this book, but I finally read one that hooked me into finding out what happens next. By the time I was a quarter-way thought I was vested in what would happened next. Halfway through I could not put this book down without thinking about the people in this book.
B000JJRIN4|5.0|the sweet escape is basically a sequel  to l.a.m.b. the difference with l.a.m.b. is the sweet escape has more of the typical hip hop/rap beats we hear out now. you will hear that in songs such as orange county girl and breakin' up. i enjoyed TSE but it doesn't have enough strong songs like l.a.m.b. did. the album had some of it high points and low points.  one might think that songs such as wind it up and yummy sound overproduced. i still got love for this album, though. :) i would give this 4.5/5 rating.<br /><br />1. wind it up (4.5/5)- hearing gwen's yodeling just made me feel so painfully embarrassed. if the lyrics weren't so catchy and addicting, i would have given it a lower rating. it's hard to over look this line \\"i know he thinks ur fine and stuff, but does he know how 2 wind u up?\\"<br /><br />2. the sweet escape (5/5)-best song on the album. it's definately her strongest single.<br /><br />3. orange county girl (3/5)- her rapping on here is just not good, but it worked for \\"hollaback girl\\". it's not something i would put on repeat.<br /><br />4. early winter (5/5)-it reminds me of her days with no doubt.<br /><br />5. now that you got it (5/5)-i heard the other version with damian marley. she should have added that one to the album!!!<br /><br />6. 4 in the morning (5/5)-i think gwen is at her best when she sings these type of songs. it sounds really beautiful.<br /><br />7. yummy (3.5/5)-once again, i like the catchy lyrics but the song sounds overproduced but then again the ending makes u want to breakdance or pop n lock...<br /><br />8. fluorescent (5/5)- very cool beats!!!<br /><br />9. breakin' up (3.5/5)-what was gwen thinkin when she did this song??? the lyrics sound so ridiculous. if simon was to listen to do this, he would have said \\"complete, utter mess!\\". this song wouldn't guarenteed to make u stay on american idol....that's for sure! i must admit though that the beats are hot.<br /><br />10. don't get it twisted (4.5/5)- for the whole time, i kept thinking about britney spears...especially the \\"uh ooohh...woaah\\" part.<br /><br />11.  u started it (5/5)- off all the songs i heard on this record, i think this one has the nicest beats besides the sweet escape. it actually sounds really cute.<br /><br />12. wonderful life (5/5)-very moby influenced.11.  u started it (5/5)- off all the songs i heard on this record, i think this one has the nicest beats besides the sweet escape. it actually sounds really cute.     12. wonderful life (5/5)-very moby influenced.
B002WCLG3O|2.0|I am a big Halo fan and I avoided to watch the episodes on Waypoint or Youtube hoping to be stunned by the final Blu-Ray<br />Well, the Blu-Ray is here with HD graphics.. but the episodes are a 7 floor pile of trash<br />I have almost fell asleep watching it.. only the last chapter (Package) is somehow decent<br /><br />I strongly suggest to download the videos at any quality and avoid spending money on it
B0016MOWP0|5.0|Having recently purchased a HD TV, i knew it was only a matter of time before i bought a Blu-Ray player as well. Sure enough, a week after buying the TV, i splashed out the cash for a Blu-Ray machine. That was the easy part.    Looking at the newly released Blu-Ray titles, and the significant price difference between a regular DVD and the movie on Blu-Ray, i began to look through titles i already owned on DVD and what i thought would deserve an upgrade in picture quality and sound. Without much hesitation, Point Break sprung to mind.    I'm not going to review the actual movie. That's already been covered many times over. But assuming you've already seen the movie, this is more about what to expect from the HD version, as opposed to the regular DVD copy.    Well, the film looks FANTASTIC. You have to bear in mind that the film came out in 1991. Granted, that's not that long ago. But in terms of how technology has evolved over the past 20 years, it's a long time. For the surfing scenes, the waves are so much clearer, and the sound really does make you believe you're in the surf too. For the skydiving scenes, the aerial footage is amazingly sharp. When i first saw the movie in theatres, i was blown away by the water and air shots. Buying it on VHS, then DVD, and now Blu-Ray, i can honestly say the movie just keeps on getting more and more enjoyable. I've been a fan of Mark Isham (music composer for this film, and many others) and his score is brought vividly to life on this HD format.    Extras wise, it's the same as the DVD re-release a few years back (Adrenaline edition). A few deleted scenes, 4 new featurettes featuring interviews with the late Swayze and 2 of the surfing gang, plus John C McGinley and an entertaining Gary Busey).    I highly recommend you upgrading to Blu-Ray. You'll be glad you did.
B002T921AC|5.0|A must have for the Justin Bieber fans everywhere. My niece is a fan and she just goes exstatic over his music. She listens to the cd all the time and I can't hear it enough of how much she loves her cd.
B001R10BMS|4.0|I got this movie as a present for someone who LOVES Bond movies.  He likes the movie, and I enjoyed it also.  It's funny at times, there's action, and of course Sean Connery makes it (even though he is a little older).  Overall, good buy, especially if you're looking to buy the large collections that they have, because this is the only older Bond movie that is not included in those DVD collections.
B002BIULQ2|5.0|If you love Hannah Montana and you love anything Disney has made then this movie is definately for you.
B002L3RVCY|5.0|I was extremely skeptical of this series, and did not watch it until it came out on Blu-Ray. However, I was very pleasantly surprised. The CGI looks amazing, has a lot of great detail, and the stories are actually pretty interesting. You get to see a lot of character development, and a lot of development around the other races and their home worlds. If you are a Star Wars fan, or you have a kid you want to get interested it, then this is a great series to pick up.
B00005JKC3|5.0|A great buy for fans of the Incredible Hulk. It has action, suspense, a little bit of romance, thrills, and a fun for the kid in all of us film.
B00007BHOE|2.0|Very intense show. Band is together visually and has tons of energy. It's my first Slipknot purchase and didn't really sell me on the band musically. Great guitar talent spends vast majority of the time banging out one-finger detuned chords. Vocals are cliched cookie monster growl almost always. Drums, on the other hand, are mind-meltingly slammin'. Overall, it's not bad but, to me, it lacks the variety and creativity of a Godsmack or Disturbed. I'm sure the purists will disagree but, hey, it's my review and my honest opinion.
0767817478|5.0|If you like big lizards and Godzilla. Then this film is for you because it has action, thrills, adventure, and excitement.
B002R68U7K|4.0|I bought this product knowing I had all of the original songs already as well as Britney's My Prerogative Greatest Hits Music Video DVD. I wanted this product because I wanted to have the Music video's released after Britney's first Greatest Hits Release on DVD as well. Also, I knew there were many B-SIDE Tracks included in this collection that I didn't previously have and some I hadn't even heard yet. Buying the box set also gets you the Cool Box, a Great Booklet & the great feeling that comes from adding another awesome Britney Item to Your Growing Fan Collection.  The only disappointment I experienced after receiving this product was that two disks that came in the collection did not contain the tracks that they were labeled as.  For Example, The CD I Pulled from the \\"TOXIC\\" CD Sleeve had been labeled properly; TOXIC & REMIX, But When I Put it into My Computer to Add to Itunes, It was actually Another Copy of The \\"Baby one more Time\\" & REMIX. So I was jipped out of two disks and 4 songs.  Normally I would have contacted whomever was in charge of shipping this product and find out who I need to speak to about the issue, then have it resolved immediately. However, Although I was bummed out about having two wrong CD's in my set, I didn't feel the need or desire to complain about it. The Collection is a Great Product and I'm fully aware that mistakes happen.  I was also sure that I wasn't the only one this could've happened to and that amazon probably had to deal with plenty of grief from A LOT of Upset Britney Fans; So I Chose to Take the Best of My New Britney Memorabilia, be thankful I had the money to spend on the product, and let it go.  After all, I think the product would have been completely reasonable at $100.00, yet it was substantially less than that. So in my opinion, even with the mistakes I got my moneys worth.
0395389496|5.0|A great holiday storie. Warm and enjoyable and it has a childlike innocense and children of all ages will love this book.
0618918248|5.0|Raised in a strict religious family and being on the tilt...I was unsure of whether or not to dive into this material.  Only out of fear of finding out everything I was raised to know would come crumbling at my feet. Dawkins' book presents material in a clear logical format that is both humble and direct.  Its not easy to write about the material he presents in the humble way he does.  Definitely buy this book.  Contrary to what I was afraid of... my world didn't come crumbling down around my feet.  Instead, it helped me to develop a better perspective of the world we live in.
B00005JPMZ|5.0|An awesome buy for fans of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and the kid in all of us.
006621131X|5.0|I picked up Just Kids not knowing what to expect as I was actually unfamiliar with most of Patti Smith's work  (and could only remember Mapplethorpe's dust-up with the NEA after his death), but I found this book so compelling and ultimately so inspiring to anyone who wishes to pursue his/her art. And unexpectedly, I discovered a beautiful, non-traditional love story so moving that I sat alone and cried for about an hour upon finishing Just Kids. I wholeheartedly recommend this book.
B00006IU73|4.0|I heard of Porcupine Tree by watching Gavin Harrison on a Modern Drummer Drum Festival DVD. Harrison is amazing and he plays some Porcupine Tree material for his set on the DVD. So I decided to to pick up this CD for the track \\"The Sound of Muzak\\". Overall, the CD is solid stuff if you like Tool, Pink Floyd inspired prog rock. Not as heavy as your typical Tool track, but very melodic and fantastic drumming. They have a ways to go I think but this is definitely worth picking up, not only for the drumming, but as a good effort all around. If you like good melodic prog rock, I would check these guys out.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I watched part of this as a teen when was first shown. It made an unforgetable impression on me. This is the most complete WWII documentary series ever made. One part even has the creator explaining the criteria for scope of this project. A must-see for all who are interested in  WWII history.
B001CDLAT4|4.0|One of the first things I realized was that this film was virtually non verbal. By having this silence in the movie, there was a dramatic focus on what I saw more than what someone in the movie told me what I was seeing. It portrayed the global perspective of life in such a way that it felt as if you were truly there experiencing nature and the way many people coexist. It was amazing how it captured natural regions in the world that appeared timeless, as though you were in a different era of time. Tranquility was the first word that came to mind as the film went on to show the humanity in different cultures with their beliefs and practices, how they lived and for some, how they lived on in death. The film revealed the diversity of people, but also depicted an invisible interconnectedness, a global commonness about the inhabitants of the world and for our instinct to live.  As the film progressed, it went on to depict the industrialization of land and development of cities on a global scale, from farming to manufacturing, how it was affecting our natural resources. It revealed how overly populated Earth truly is; we look like tiny insignificant ants following suit to keep our respective lives going. At this point there was a different perception of people. The film captured how many more people are out there stressed and struggling to provide food and shelter, caring for their families, and working mundanely in an almost hypnotic, robotic way, as they went on about what they were doing. There were also many people self-absorbed in what they were doing and how they were living their own lives, it was as if that interconnectedness didn't exist on a conscious level (because it does exist as we are all living beings on Earth), but rather people ignored one another. Everything I saw invoked a deep feeling of appreciation.
0786182466|5.0|Confederacy of Dunces unabridged is simply excellent in everyway. Should have been made into a movie by now but legal issues abound. Wonderful car entertainment from O'Toole's genius, award winner book.
1416550550|4.0|I enjoyed The Forgotten Garden overall,  however, it was confusing at times, I had to go back and forth through chapters to keep characters straight. In addition, each chapter was a different year (depending on which character) jumping between 1913, 2005, 1976, 1900, on and on.  This jumping back and forth between time periods and characters was disconcerting. A family tree in the beginning would have helped out a lot.     The author did manage to pull all of them together into a more cohesive story line by the end of the book, and it was a well told tale.
0385504225|2.0|I was really into the drama and the suspense, until I just couldn't take them finally finding the last piece to the puzzle only to discover, that they need to run to some other obscure, random monument in D.C. that would certainly have the mysterious missing piece.  And of course it wouldn't.  It just became a tedious exercise in frustration and boredom.  I almost felt like skipping a few pages when Brown made mention of them finding some new direction to go in, since I knew it would be wrong and I might as well just save myself the time.     Instead of skipping ahead, I just stopped reading.  I can't say that it's so predictable that I know how the book ends, but I just got so put-off by being toyed with that I don't particularly care if Langdon and \\"generic female assistant\\" are killed by \\"bad guy from random 'secret society A'\\", or if they unlock \\"hidden secret that 'secret society B' doesn't want exposed to the world\\".  I hope everything works out for everyone, which I'm sure it will.  Except for the bad guy, who will either die or go to prison due to some plot twist that Langdon unleashes at the end, when everything is about as clear as mud.      It's not a \\"bad\\" book, or at least it doesn't start out that way.  At the end it gets really tedious and boring and I feel like Brown was sitting at his desk thinking \\"I wonder how long I can keep these people caring about this.\\"      I imagine cracking these codes is tedious and involved and frustrating in real life, but I think he went a little too far in the step-by-step instructions and drama at each turn.
B00337KM2S|1.0|I understand why they made the film...but it lacks in every possible way.  The film is just boring.  Don't waste your time.
0345495004|4.0|This book held a huge surprise for me at the end (don't worry I won't ruin it for you).  I read this book hoping to gain a greater insight into the life of Frank Lloyd Wright what I didn't expect was the subsequent focus on the feminist movement in the early 1900's.  I did enjoy the book and did enjoy the very humanist nature surrounding the characters.  If you have an image in your head of what Frank Lloyd Wright was like you may want to set that aside,  as this book does bring to light many of the flaws present within Frank Lloyd Wright's character.  This is not a book about Frank Lloyd Wright however, it is about an affair with a women who traveled the world with him and resided in his home.  I greatly appreciated the use of actual news clippings and articles throughout the book.  They allowed a very real picture to be drawn as to what these individuals were experiencing.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|This is such a great film.  Beyond my wildest expectations.  These characters stayed with me long after the film was over; in fact, for weeks after!  Well directed, acted, scored and the cinematography was sensational!  It speaks to the human experience...to those of us who have longed to love someone, but just wasn't able to.    This film will remain forever as one of the greatest pictures ever made.  No doubt.
0805091742|1.0|I agree with the reviewer who said this information could have been reduced to a page or 2.  I found it to be more a sales pitch for using checklists in medical environments, than a detailed book about how to use checklists in general.  There are only  a few sketchy mentions of the types of checklists with no information on how to determne which type is best for what purpose.  So while I am sure this is useful for medical professionals, and I for one hope all medical professionals use checklists, but I didn't find the information helpful for us non-medical types.
B0031OCY2E|4.0|The Informant is based on a true story and you wonder what Mark Whitacre (Matt Damon) was trying to do?  He had a good job at the well-known Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), agricultural giant.  Suddenly he decides to be a whistleblower.  As lie after lie are revealed, he exposes his company's multi-national price-fixing conspiracy to the FBI, as well as strange embezzlement's he has going on that never seem to end.  The number goes from $2 million to $11 million embezzled. He imagines himself as Secret Agent 014 because he is twice as smart as 007??  He must be living in a fairy tale world.<br /><br />The FBI is flabbergasted as more and more conflicting stories and plots emerge.  They are beside themselves as stories keep evolving.  His stories prevent the FBI from helping him as much as they could.  What is he imagining and what is real?<br /><br />There is some humor and the frustrated FBI Agents (Scott Bakula and Joel McHale)  feel it is impossible to figure out the whole story.<br /><br />Overall the movie is entertaining and Matt Damon plays a likable whistle blower
B002VPE1B6|5.0|see it in three d  see it in the morning  the first time that a whole science fiction planet was brought to life realistically   a great love story  the first time you will cheer for the aliens, not the humans
B0007OCG4W|4.0|The Closer is a witty unconventional drama of betrayal and romance.  Why do people cheat and risk losing their true love?  It also delves into how much one can really know their closest companion and whether they are always strangers.<br /><br />The film is directed by Mike Nichols and is a story of four people, initially strangers. He does a fabulous job of illuminating how much one can really know about the person they love.  A complicated set of relationships showing fidelity and cheating are examined.<br /><br />The characters are Dan (Jude Law), Alice (Natalie Portman), Larry (Clive Owen), and Anna (Julia Roberts).  Dan writes obituaries, Alice is a stripper, Anna is a photographer and Larry is a dermatologist.<br /><br />The movie jumps from first meetings to humorous and sometimes raw honesty in their entangled lives.  The script is adult, edgy, and humorous.  The actors do the script justice and the story holds throughout.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|This show never stops amazing me.  There are so many twists and turns and more questions to keep you watching.  Gotta love it.  :)
B001OQCV2E|2.0|2012 is another end of the earth film, however this time with the best special effects I have seen. The story is weak, however, the characters help it out a lot despite their absurd dialogue.  The action is fast and furious and the two hours seem to go by fairly fast.<br /><br />The theory behind the movie's end of the earth scenario is weak and somewhat altered from what the History Channel's \\"End of the Earth\\" series spouted.<br /><br />This may end up being a \\"campy\\" film - it is so preposterous at times - sort of a finely tuned trashy spectacle.  Looking back, it may be an inside joke, and looking back it gives me great belly laughs
0385523904|5.0|Barbara Demick's reporting on \\"The Hermit Kingdom\\" has as its focus, the lives of six defectors from North Korea.  She never makes it clear how she happened to locate these six individuals, a question I would like to know the answer to.<br /><br />Regardless of this oversight, \\"Nothing to Envy:  Ordinary Lives in North Korea\\" is an extraordinary piece of first-person journalism.  Demick probes into each of these lives.  She has a way of finding the core of what makes each of these people tick.<br /><br />It's a dangerous path to become a defector from one's own country, particularly when that country is North Korea.  \\"Great Leader\\" Kim Il-sung created a secular, communist-ideology state based on a personality cult, whose dynasty continues on with his successor son, \\"Dear Leader\\" Kim Jung-il.  Despite the breakdown of the Berlin Wall, the breakup of the Soviet Union and the rise of a market economy in mainland China, North Korea continues on as a Communist state of the command-order variety, more Stalinist in its ideology than the Soviet Union was at the peak of Stalinism.<br /><br />By way of the back story, Demick provides insight into \\"Juche,\\" an ideology of self-reliance promulgated by Kim Il-sung.  Juche feeds on a Korean sense of history in which Korea was long-subservient to its dominant neighbors, China, Japan and Russia.  Kim Il-sung taps into a sense of rightful justice, a determination that Korea needs to be independent, to go it alone.  As Demick puts it, Kim Il-sung created an ideology, \\"seductive to a people whose dignity had been trampled by its neighbors for centuries.\\"<br /><br />Although fifteen years dead, Kim Il-sung's personality cult remains strong.  He is portrayed as his country's George Washington, Lenin, Stalin, Mao and Jesus, all rolled into one.<br /><br />What makes this a compelling read is the story of the lives of the six defectors, each of whom overcomes terrible odds and a life of ideological brainwashing to break free of North Koreato establish new lives.  Each person has his or her own story. I won't spoil things by saying any more about them here.<br /><br />A great read.  Five stars!
0691142165|1.0|This may be a fine book, if you are looking for mounds of data.  I don't object to the book or what's in it.  It may be a great book for all I know....but you need to be very bright, maybe a PHD or MBA or ECONOMICS nut or STATISTICS lover to enjoy this book, in my opinion.  My real objection is all the hype Amazon allows on the top of the page, talking about how great this book is.  I have read a lot of business books - I may not be the smartest person in the world but I'm not a total dummy either; most books feel like non-fiction novels of what occurred in business or with companies. This book is chock fully of charts, graphs, columns of numbers, throughout the book.  There is actually at least one place where the authors recommend skipping a few chapters due to the technical stuff coming up!  If you re-read (as I did) the hype at the top of the page, you'll see the word \\"DATA\\" cropping up in a lot of the statements.  I cannot overemphasize how this book is like an extremely technical textbook on the subject.  If you think you are getting an enjoyable, pleasant and easy to read book (not that I can't handle the big words, I'm just not impressed with them. They give me headaches), consider yourself forewarned!!!    Again, I am not saying the book is bad - just that in the editorial review section, the phrases and blurbs of opinions such as \\"must read\\", \\"essential reading\\", \\"powerful new book\\" as though they are promoting an action-adventure big screen thriller is total BS!    If you ask me, it is dry, boring, hard to read, overly complicated with tons of data and little narrative of the type I was expecting BASED ON THE HYPERBOLE.    I have read many of the reviews here and see that I am in the minority.  Nevertheless, most reviews I've written at Amazon are 5 star, I don't have an axe to grind, but I wish I'd have saved the $22.    Just telling it like it is... to paraphrase the authors ....Next time will be different for me.  I will not buy a book here before I look it over in a bookstore or right here if Amazon allows examining some of the chapters.
B002XMGGK6|3.0|First of all, I had never heard of this movie until my fiance put it into the dvd player.  It is surprisingly not bad.  However, it is graphic and bloody.  That being said it was entertaining and well thought out.  Butler played his \\"crazy/vengeful teacher\\" part well.  Briefly, it is about a man who watches his wife and daughter get killed.  When the DA doesn't handle the case the way Shelton wants, he waits ten years and plots mass distruction of the criminal system.  It bears saying a second time: BLOODY!!!!
B001675SOY|4.0|This is one band that gets a really bad wrap that do not deserve it.  I will be the first to admit their lyrics and vocals are pretty bad, but the music is right on point.  There is so much neo-classical shredding on this album, and it really does help give it a pretty unique kind of flavor.  The keyboards fit well due to the guitar sound being somewhat thin.  \\"Cowards Dead End\\" is a personal favorite and has a neo-classical inspired solo fest for the last minute.  \\"Bed of Razors\\" seamlessly incorporates the keyboards into the song to create another favorite.  There is not one bad song on here, some just better then others.  There is a certain degree of cheese to this album, but its all par for the course.  This is where they really had something fun and exciting to contribute to the metal world, they have since become increasingly irrelevant with every passing album.
1435248244|1.0|I agree with the reviewer who said this may have been a little too Young Adult for their taste. While I found the concept to be interesting, I found the book to be lacking. The characters weren't likable, and I found the main character to be annoying. While romances in these books are never believable, this one was just awkward and disappointing. I figured I would give this YA book a chance because I really enjoyed The Hunger Games and despite my criticisms for it the Twilight series was actually an enjoyable, quick read. Maybe I've exhausted the list of YA books that I would find enjoyable.
B0000252YK|1.0|Even Ozzy hates this one, which is saying something considering some of the albums he has released in the last couple decades.  \\"Shot in the Dark\\" is always the sole recognized tune from here.  it's a shame that Jake E. Lee was a part of this one, you really only get a glimpse of how skilled this guy was.  He always gets forgotten being in-between Randy and Zakk, but it's not all his fault.  Ozzy was destined to make this record regardless of who was on it,  Jake was just a hired gun.  If your an Ozzy fan check out \\"Bark at the Moon\\" also with Lee, you'll get a better idea of what this guy can do.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|The delivery and the movie was excelent. It came just in time like always the movie is excellent and recomended highly.
B000SNUMC0|2.0|After \\"The Glorious Burden\\" I had extremely high hopes for this band.  The \\"Gettysburg Trilogy\\" (from the aforementioned album) was amazing and so when I heard that Jon envisioned a two album concept I thought that he was really ready to stretch out his creative talents and create a masterpiece.  It seems like a huge chunk of the songs on here are pointless little interludes.  When the interludes then lead into songs that are boring it tends to make the interludes pointless.  This album seems to drag on for what seems like an eternity.  \\"The Clouding\\" is one of the few that really draws you in.  It has an interesting \\"floyd-like\\" intro then flows into a metal riff.  \\"Domino Decree\\" and \\"Ten Thousand Strong\\" are decent but the rest of the \\"standalone non-interlude tracks\\" are pretty bland.  It was hard to get excited for part two after hearing this.  I guess he really burnt himself out creatively with \\"The Glorious Burden\\" and decided to settle for something far less interesting.
014241493X|4.0|I had heard all of the wonderful things about John Green's books. I have saw all the awards they have received. But I had to see it with my own eyes and now I have nothing but wonderful things to say and these books deserve all of those awards!<br /><br /> When I read the blurb to this book I was a little like \\"Huh?\\" I didn't know what to expect. What I got was a hilarious story of a young boy and his friends. With a serious side. The humor was what made me love it. This was my kind of humor! The wit and banter between Quentin and his friends was awesome.<br /><br />Like I said this has a serious side too. Quentin is working through more than half of the book to find Margo. Dead or alive. Sometimes the clues are easy and sometimes they are almost impossible.<br />Overall this was a incredible book. Just like everyone says! I can't wait to read more by Green.
B00275EGX8|5.0|The Hurt Locker is probably the best war film I've ever seen.  The Film grabs you by the throat from the first frame.  It is brilliantly directed by Kathryn Bigelow, who has an eye for detail on the war front with a heart for the soldiers who fight in it.  The edting is rythmic and exact. Jeremy Renner gives a superb perfromance, as does the entire cast.  The Hurt Locker deserved the Oscars that it received.  It is a breathless, slow descent into the hell of warfare and the human suffering on all sides of the battle lines.
B00008G7UJ|1.0|Updating or modernizing a masterpiece is always a daunting task.  Who remembers, for example, Mozart's re-orchestration of Handel's \\"Messiah\\"?  For whatever reason, many people seem to think that re-writing or re-staging or re-plotting the Bard should be encouraged -- even in the most bizarre of directions.  There have been some successes:  \\"West Side Story\\" is a brilliant work of art.  \\"The Lion King\\" is essentially \\"Hamlet\\" with a happy ending.  (I'll let others decide if this was a good idea or not.)    But this \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" is an absolute disaster; an embarrassment; and would have the Bard spinning in his grave.  Words cannot begin to describe how much I loathed this film.    Some re-makes work.    This one did not.

B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|It's wonderful to live in an era when one of the all time legends of entertainment is still actively producing works. I imagine that in years to come people will look back with tremendous fondness to the days when Hayao Miyazaki was still directing and it's a blessing to know (or at least hope) that more films are yet to come. I had heard after `Howl's Moving Castle' that Miyazaki might be retiring from directing but Ponyo laid that rumor to rest. According to Wikipedia Miyazaki is signed to direct at least two more movies but at 69 years of age you never know.<br /><br />Ponyo is the story of a tiny mermaid who runs away from home only to end up in the bucket of a young boy who assumes she's a goldfish (despite her obviously humanlike face). Her father, Fujimoto, a human who now shuns humans and lives beneath the ocean tries to retrieve Ponyo using various water based magic at his disposal. Ponyo has other ideas in mind as she uses her own magic to try and become an actual human girl. Unfortunately all of this mucking around has created a rift in reality that threatens to bring complete disaster on everyone.<br /><br />If you've watched more than a few Miyazaki films you'll notice that like Walt Disney he has a particular artistic style that the animators at Studio Ghibli adhere to. The first thing I noticed about Ponyo was that the art seemed a somewhat different. It's a bit rougher or perhaps more simplistic, particularly with the characters of Ponyo and her father Fujimoto, than what I've seen in previous movies like Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke. The backgrounds by contrast are absolutely lush and gorgeous and retain the dreamlike quality that is a trademark of Miyazaki films. Most of the film takes place in charming little coastal city in Japan based on the actual city of Tomonoura. The rest is underwater and it is positively glorious. It absolutely teams with life and naturally this is all hand drawn animation. It's almost impossible these days to find animation that is 100% hand drawn but unless I am mistaken there is not a CGI frame to be seen in the film. I have to applaud the effort of the animators here in drawing some if the most dynamic, vibrant images ever.<br /><br />Miyazaki, like Pixar, has never produced a bad or even mediocre film only varying degrees of great. I felt that Howl's Moving Castle was below average on the Miyazaki scale and Ponyo is only somewhat better. My wife, on the other hand, felt that that Ponyo was every bit as good as Miyazaki's very best. For me the weakness was in the story which had a flaw or two. In particular it was hard to draw a distinction between what was supposed to be reality and what was supposed to be fantasy. Let me just say that the town in the movie undergoes a dramatic event, one which would generally be an utter disaster and yet here there seems to be no harm done. It's kind of like when Wily Coyote falls of a cliff and creates that ring of dust only to be up and around in the next scene. Miyazaki is generally pretty consistent in his stories and in this case it was hard to tell the boundaries. I also felt that the animation wasn't as strong as in the previous three Miyazaki films save for the backgrounds which are absolutely top notch. I don't regret for one second adding this film to my personal collection sight unseen and any nitpicking doesn't take away from the fact that this is a great film.animation that is 100% hand drawn but unless I am mistaken there is not a CGI frame to be seen in the film.

B0028RXXFC|5.0|It had been a couple of years since I last saw Rome, so I had forgotten how good it really is.  The costuming is magnificent, the writing snaps, and the acting is incredible.  (The only exception here being the actress who played Cleopatra.  She's very pretty, but just doesn't sell the role.)      I also really liked the packaging.  The idea of the DVDs being chapters in a book was a nice one.    I do, however, have one major gripe.  My set had two copies of the third disk of season one and no copy of the fourth disk.  So I'm missing three episodes.  Given the difficulties I had in getting the set delivered (the first order was lost in the mail), this is a pretty big annoyance.
B001GCUO5M|4.0|I was excited to finally get in the theater and see this movie.<br />As I sat and watched this movie play out, I got a really uneasy<br />nervous, queasy feeling, it was such a visually moving piece of cinema but<br />not always easy to follow. Great acting and directing, the scenery, especially the weather helped give the movie a nice surreal  tone and I just love being in that dark, dank, institution for the criminally insane. Creepy. I think the movie<br />plays with you and makes you think with its constant twists. Leonardo DiCaprio<br />is excellent in his role from start to finish. It certainly wasn't a perfect movie but its well worth seeing for it period in time and the twists.

B001IF252C|1.0|I read the reviews here but I thought \\"this won't happen to me\\" but, it did. I upgraded to a mac mini server to replace a dual G5 and was happy with the performance but could only get 1280x800 resolution. After reading up, I found that the Apple person didn't tell me I needed a $100+ cable to get the resolution I was used to, 2560x1600. I went all the way back to the store, bought the cable and immediately saw the 'pixel garbage' problem. I even tried using an external USB hub to power it and still saw the problem. What the problem looks like are quick flashes of a dotted line of pixels, looking something like this  ..... . .  ..  .... .. ..... ...  and it shows up around several places seemingly around the mouse cursor. It doesn't happen all the time but enough to irritate you and make you want to return the machine. Apple has got to be aware of the issue because after a very brief conversation with the store manager here in San Francisco (Stonestown) they took it back without a restocking fee. BTW, until Apple resolves this issue there isn't a monitor-less machine you can buy which will drive a 30-inch monitor to it's max resolution and, doesn't cost over twice as much as the most expensive mac mini. It's really a shame.<br /><br />Again, I urge you, don't buy this cable...you *WILL* run into the same problem, take it from all the reviews here and on other sites. I didn't listen and wasted a lot of time and effort.
0061537969|4.0|Garth Stein's \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" is a paean to man's best friend, the loyal, (unwittingly) quiet, loving and wise dog. Anyone who is an animal lover, and, in all likelihood, anyone with a heart, will be touched by this moving and funny book. Stein joins three unlikely topical bedfellows seamlessly: Formula 1 auto racing, a sentient dog, through whom the story is narrated, and a tug-at-the-heartstrings story of a family torn apart. Through Enzo the dog's sympathetic and observant eyes, the reader also watches helplessly, as certain events unfold in the story that are infuriating and unfair to the point of becoming enraging. Stein is a sensitive and yet pragmatic storyteller as the reader becomes engulfed with the same feelings of helplessness and frustration that Enzo feels as he watches the family around him fragment and separate. Anyone who has ever owned a pet has had the distinct belief that he/she understands exactly what we are saying, and that any behavioral response or anomaly is an attempt on his/her part to bridge the interspecies communication barrier (\\"I've been waiting patiently for you ALL day long! And since you couldn't even think about what it feels like to sit, alone, in the dark for hours with no bathroom access, see how YOU like finding a special treat in the middle of your bed when you collapse, exhausted, into it!\\"). Enzo as a narrator is so lucid, so believable in his thought processes and frustration at his intrinsic inability to effectively communicate to his humans, due to his damned \\"dogness,\\" that while devouring this book in the span of one day, I felt alternating urges to pull my cats onto my lap as I read, followed by attempting to engage in a real, heart-to-heart conversation with them beyond the usual kitty-cooing babble nonsense.    Even more than provoking questions about the sentience of the domestic animals that we live with, Stein successfully offers poignant metaphors for the struggles and strains of life as well asinspiring meditations on how to approach them; e.g., in life, as in racing, \\"the car goes where the eyes go.\\" Never stop racing, never give up - as Enzo would \\"say:\\" \\"Faster! Faster!\\"
B002SJIO5E|4.0|The Bottom Line:    District 9 does a lot of things right and offers some compelling science-fiction entertainment, so I'm able to forgive the fact that in the last half hour all ideas are thrown out the window in favor of nonstop action and poor characterizations (e.g. the Nigerians who show up so we can have another villain in the film); it's an intriguing film and at times a powerful one, but it could have been so much more.    3/4
B002ZBT84G|3.0|As an avid Gil Scott-Heron fan I was happy to know that this great artist was releasing a new album. After listening to this product I was confused, disappointed and unable to connect to this one as I had in his previous albums. I have purchased many of his albums over the years but to me, the songs on this latest cd barely resembled his past work. I was especially looking forward to hearing his take on the War, 911, the former President and our current President. I\\"ll always be a follower of GSH but this time, I feel it fell short.<br />I was expecting much more.
B001HUHBAE|3.0|The Bottom Line:    People say great things about Zodiac but they're apparently talking about a different film than the middling film I saw: after an energetic first half in which the threat of the Zodiac killer keeps the proceedings tense and quick-moving, the film segues into a cliched take on obsession, with all the usual beats in place (even Chloe Sevigny can't do anything with the nagging-wife-who-doesn't-realize-a-man's-gotta-do-what-a-man's-gotta-go role) and a ending that doesn't conclude the film as much as just let it peter out.    2.5/4

B002XTXFU8|4.0|It's very difficult to describe Bronson, and even harder to pigeon hole it into a specific category or genre. Hailed a new \\"Clockwork Orange\\" is a bit misleading, as it doesn't really deal with an overall dystopian view of wild indoctrinated youth, more so one individuals sad spiral into mental self awareness of an inner voice. Although highly stylized, it's also overall, quite a sad depiction of infamous British criminal Michael Peterson, (renamed Charlie Bronson by his bare knuckle fight promoter boss and former inmate Lenny McLean)<br /><br />For me, it's extremely easy to relate to growing up in 70's England, as a young man with few options (they were hard times all round, with high employment, and a nation still suffering under the machinations of the government of the day). The filming locations and set designs are authentic, and the sense of poverty and misdirection almost tangible.<br />What follows is \\"based\\" on a true story, a more accurate description would be to say it's based upon Petersons own biographies and books written while incarcerated, and then polished with a lot of poetic license by director Nicolas Wefn.<br />A boy from a lower middle class but nonetheless stable background, Peterson displayed violent tendencies from a young age, and a slow burn feel of inevitability that he would become the nihilistic man of the title.<br />However, from a criminal point of view, Bronson was far more of a criminal inside prison than out. A bungled hold up at a post office brought him a 7 year term, he never actually killed anyone (as he states quite clearly during the movie), and from there begins the immergence of the inner man. After the torment of his first sentence he is freed, even falls in love, and bounces around between his eccentric uncles 70's style opium den (much red lights and heavy drapes inside a projects style apartment high rise) and bare knuckle brawling against men and even dogs!<br />Still searching for an unknown ambition, \\"I only ever wanted to be famous\\" voices actor Tom Hardy in the title role, and like so many people of his generation his aspirations were common for men of his age, although they did not know exactly how or what they would become famous for.<br />Knowing his true place is back inside he quickly recommits and returns to prison, and sets about countless hostage taking, and guard beating episodes, each one gaining him more notoriety.<br />He now begins to believe, his chance at glory lies in infamy, on the inside as a feared convict. His achievements were realized when he was labeled by the British press (and other sources) as \\"Britain's most Violent criminal\\"<br /><br />Still in prison today, he has spent more than 30 years in solitary confinement for his continuous violent behavior.<br />I'll stop here to add that Tom Hardy is amazing in what must have been a difficult role. Far removed from Praetor Shinzon in Star Trek Nemesis - now appearing much older physically, he has matured, and certainly beefed up for the role. But the strength of the performance lies in the depth of the portrayal.<br />The monosyllabic narration scenes that seem to join sections of the story together draw you in and keep you compelled to watch and you believe the story. Hardy exudes an almost palpable menace, as he flicks from deep thought and introspective silence, even sadness to a violent boiling rage in the blink of an eye, truly scary.<br />The violent scenes are unflinching and brutal, though not overdone or gratuitous. They are also unwavering in how they portray the futility of Bronson's actions, reinforcing his inner turmoil.<br />Quite short at 92 minutes, it is nonetheless a powerful biopic, regardless of how accurate the material.<br />I felt great sympathy for the character (which probably sounds misplaced for someone who attacked, injured and brutalized many prison guards) but the Director (and Hardy) elevate the story to a level above just violence.<br />The scenes where he returns to hisparents new smaller home now replete of his childhood belongings show an undercurrent of helpless, almost childlike loss and sadness for example.<br />The film flicks between the narration and story scenes to Hardy playing out his life on a make believe music hall stage to a willing audience, giving a dreamy quality that probably prompted the comparisons to Kubrick, and Clockwork Orange.<br />Accomplished author, artist and sculpture on the one hand, vicious psychotic thug on the other,  that never lets you know when he will flick from one to the other makes for memorable (if not always easy) viewing. 4 stars.longings show an undercurrent of helpless, almost childlike loss and sadness for example.

B002FOQXZK|3.0|The music here is simply incredible.  Consumed in one sitting, it is completely absorbing.  The listener is transported into this stark, futuristic landscape (or more accurately, skyscape) untethered from the mundane life on this planet.  This album would get 5 stars easily without the artist saying anything, which unfortunately, he does.    I find Kid Cudi's lyrics, vocal tone, and \\"singing\\" absolutely terrible.  I cannot think of another group of songs so utterly ruined by the vocalist (except for Dream Theater's entire catalog).  To me, it sounds like someone awakening from a long afternoon nap, hearing a song he's heard once and likes a little, and attempting to hum along with the melody.  Or a lazy bumblebee buzzing around your head when you're at a concert in the park.  You're trying to enjoy the music, but that droning tone just won't let you.  If anyone knows where to get the instrumentals from this CD, please let me know.    Aside from tone, Kid Cudi's lyrical shortcomings are accentuated when placed alongside the guest artists, as on #12 (Make Her Say).  I've never been a huge Kanye West fan, but he is a respectable lyricist.  On this particular song Kanye sounds like Bach after listening to 45 minutes of John Williams.    Bottom line, if you can get past the vocals, this could be an incredible album.  I just can't.
B002T9H2MO|2.0|I so wanted to drink the Kool-Aid and become a Moonie like so many other entranced reviewers on [...] along with the critics at [...] but it just did not happen for me.    Before the movie starts I know it's a low budget indie sci-fi film. Cool. No aliens or laser guns. Fine. It's supposed to be a thriller set on the Moon. Bring it on. Then nothing happened. No path down a strange philosophical or metaphysical road. No powerful emotions. No mysterious atmosphere to generate suspense and mounting anxiety.    What it did have is fine acting by Sam Rockwell, awesome CGI shots of the moonscape and the mechanical harvesters (the harvesters were nicknamed Matthew, Mark, Luke and John) and the director is the son of David Bowie. Those were the highlights for me. Fini.    Many, many sci-fi films pay homage, in some respect, to previous ground breaking films of the same genre. \\"Moon\\", however, was so derivative and predictably parallel to other films like \\"2001: A space Odyssey (HAL 9000 vs GERTY 3000) and \\"Bladerunner\\" (Clones vs Replicants) that it came off like a television show.     Also, Director Duncan Jones lost me with his idea to have Sam Rockwell clap his hands to turn on his TV and then when the TV did come on it was old reruns of \\"Bewitched\\" and \\"Marry Tyler Moore\\".  Oh yeah? Seriously and for real, it did happen in this film.    Kevin Spacey's voice as the robot GERTY 3000 was like the bell ringing for Pavlov's dog. You salivate waiting for something good to happen because there is real talent behind that voice. But, alas, you wait so long that your mouth becomes dry as moon dust.     This film turned out to be so slow and ponderous that it weighed down the ability of the story to naturally evolve like a pair of lead filled moon boots. After sitting through this dull tedium you get an ending that was slam on the brakes abrupt (again, like a television show). After all is said and done, this film left me feeling unsatisfied, like drinking Tang instead of real orange juice.

B000AJJNPY|3.0|I bought the Takk and Agaetis Byrjun CDs after seeing the Heima DVD which was a wonderful introduction to the band. The music on the DVD, accompanied as it was by breathtaking imagery, impressed me so much that I ordered both CDs without reading the copious reviews or listening to all the clips. When the albums arrived I listened to them back-to-back and I wasn't disappointed with either, but Agaetis Byrjun seemed vastly more original and beautiful than Takk. Each subsequent listening has yielded the same result, even though I have heard them in a variety of moods and a variety of settings. Takk seems like a weak echo of Agaetis Byrjun. The same ethereal elements are there but there is a lack of an essential emotional connection. If you are just becoming familiar with Sigur Ros, I would suggest starting with Agaetis Byrjun.

B000N6TX1I|4.0|In many ways, \\"Children of Men\\" is a very typical futuristic thriller. It of course extrapolates the current worries of our time into a dystopian nightmare of tomorrow. World ravaged by terrorism, anti-terrorism, and global warming? Check. Shadowy, sem-fascist government? Check. Soulless capitalism relentlessly shilled in ubiquitous advertising? Check. Population stripped of dignity and basic compassion? Check. There is more than one reference to the war in Iraq, which will undoubtedly date this film in just a few years.    However, \\"Children of Men\\" manages to rise above this genre's cliches in several important ways. First, the most pressing problem is not one specifically related to the troubles of today: the world is dying because for some unknown reason, women can no longer have children. The film opens with the news that the youngest person on earth (18 years old) has died in a brawl.     Second, the film is only set about twenty years into the future, so while the there have been some technical advancements, the landscape looks largely the same. It's just different enough to be disquieting. The double decker buses of London are still there. It's just that now, those buses pass billboards that read, \\"Avoiding Fertility Tests is a Crime.\\"    Most importantly, while this film does not break any ground in its genre, what it does, it does well. Other reviewers have complained that the film does not not make a tremendous amount of sense, and this is true. However, the film's main thrust is not a commentary on today's social moores. It is first and foremost a thriller, and we get just enough sense of what's going on to make us care, without getting bogged down in massive expositions on the hows and whys. We are told that the world is in a bad place, and we are drawn in with compelling cinematography, a fast-moving plot, and good acting.    I also found some of the final scenes involving Kee, the pregnant woman, quite moving, even more so because the film ends on a decidedly ambivalent note. Early on in the film, the hero says that even if scientists discovered the cure for infertility, it wouldn't help: the world's already gone to pot. And in fact, the movie does not even get that far. It's about saving ONE woman who is pregnant. Whether this will save the world is an open question. The film also does a good job of fleshing Kee out as a person, with an actual personality. I originally passed on this movie because I assumed that she would be treated as a precious, but essentially non-sentient vessel that holds The Antidote to the World's Troubles. While some characters in the film do see her as such, the viewers are allowed to experience her as a unique individual.    Final analysis: a very strong example of its genre. Not as imaginative as BladeRunner, not as satiric as Brazil, but 100x better than, say, Running Man. Definitely worth watching.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|The saga of the Winchester brothers continue in Season 4 and the series just keeps getting better with each passing year.  The forces bent on turning Sam and Dean into enemies are hard at work and it is this tension (will they succeed?) that keeps the viewer watching episode to episode.  This season the boys get visited by Angels; the question is: are they truly here to do good?  Also included is a great episode that is shot in black and white and which harkens back to the good ole days of the old Universal horror movies; it's a real treat.  We also discover that there is a third Winchester son.  As with the previous seasons, there are plenty of monsters, ghouls, and creatures of the night to keep the Winchester boys busy...but it is their changing relationship that is the real point of interest.    This season comes in plastic inner packaging with the DVDs separated onto plastic holders, so the packaging isn't quite as sturdy as previous volumes.  Still included, however, is the program guide and some great special features which explore the history of Heaven and Purgatory.  For any SUPERNATURAL fan, this season is a must-have.  After watching all the episodes don't be surprised if you want to watch them all over again immediately.  It's that good!

Probably the best thing the band has ever done, this album sounds like they locked themselves in a dark room, turned off all the lights, did as many drugs as they could get a hold of, turned everything up all the way, and recorded whatever came out. It's a scary, damaging, album. The kind that will expose the rest of your collection as the weak, poseur, garbage that it is. Don't base your opinion on any of Electric Wizard's other records, they're fine in their own right, but none of them can hold a candle to this. Doom on!
B0025KVLTM|5.0|\\"Sgt. Pepper\\" is arguably the Beatles most recognized album. Released in 1967 at the peak of the 'hippy/flower power' movement, it combined art with music in a way that no album had previously done. From the way upbeat, \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" to the surreal, somewhat somber, \\"A Day In The Life\\", every song is a classic. The sound is what makes this album amazing. George Martin and his son remastered and remixed several songs for the \\"Love\\" album. This same remarkable remastering has revitalized \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" to an unbelievable clarity. Mixed with an array of sound effects, the remastering not only enhances the instruments and vocals, but brings all those art/music sound effects throughout the album to a vivid height. It's really remarkable how great this album sounds.<br /><br />Also included in the great album is a multi-paged booklet with some excellent liner notes. There is also a diagram identifying all the famous people in the cover photo! On your computer, you can play the five-minute mini-documentary about the album (Quick-time), which showcases comments from all four Beatles and George Martin. All of this is mixed in with rare photos never seen before. Imagine learning that this album was recorded at night with over 400 hours devoted to it. That's perfectionism and its shows. In fact, there is a mini-documentary for all the Beatles albums. This CD is a collector's item and a perfect showcase for the Beatles genius.

B001KOFH2G|4.0|I was unfamilar with Firefly. The flim has sold me to see the old TV series. The quality of the Blu-ray is top notch and leaps off the screen. Overall, an excellent pasttime.
0312370849|3.0|I was immediately taken in by the beginning of the book. By the end of the middle portion she was repeating herself as though she needed more words b/c her publisher said it had to be a certain length. When I love a book, I keep it for my collection, this one I donated to my local library
B001QOGYBI|5.0|I honestly didn't know what to expect with this movie.  It is not a cartoon but it is not a regular movie, and I just didn't get it.  The movie is also based on a book by Roald Dahl called Fantastic Mr. Fox which I unfortunately hadn't read before.  This movie is adorable and I cannot believe it held my 3 year old and 20 month old's attention for the whole movie!  I know they didn't really get what was going on, but they were fascinated by it, as was I.  The movie was about Mr. Fox who lives a dangerous life as a chicken stealer, then quits when he finds out he is going to be a dad.  After a few years, he realizes he is missing something and decides to do a few 'jobs' stealing from the meanest farmers in the county.  The movie has some great lessons though like:  It is okay to be different, Don't lie, and Work together.  I found myself laughing throughout this movie, and I actually won't mind when my boys want to watch it again!  I am always going to pick up the book!<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to all ages.  It is a cute tale and if you loved the book by Roald Dahl, then you have to check it out.  I also really liked the voices, for example, George Clooney is Mr. Fox and he pretty much talks the whole movie.  I also loved the relationship between his son and nephew - one an outside and the other one popular and good at everything.  All the animals though are adorable and great additions to the movie.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|A wonderful adaptation!   I watched it three times, and it got better every time.  If you can live with the slightly more modern mannerisms, then you should love this adaptation.  I have a feeling that Ms. Austen would not have minded the slight liberties taken -- she always seems willing enough to welcome the new, while respecting tradition.  What is important for me is that the emotional truth of the novel is maintained, and even enhanced on occasion, if that is possible.      My favorite actor in this Emma is emphatically the beautiful Ms. Garai.  She gives a luminous, expressive and enchanting performance.  But virtually every actor does a great job, and we are allowed through their performances to see almost all the characters as fully rounded human beings, rather than stereotypes.  What a triumph for all concerned!  Do yourself a favor, and watch this Emma.
B002LB13SE|4.0|I disliked the original Wes Craven movie, which is unusual since I normally like his work. The original was slow, focused too much on the sexual depravity and imbalanced overall.     I was suspicious when I saw this was remade and had little expectations. I was thoroughly impressed. The new director solved all the problems the original had. While one should be prepared for the vicious rape scene, it isn't overly focused on time wise. It came out more balanced with the beginning middle and end and no slow periods of no action. I've already purchased this one.

0446567337|4.0|Let me start by saying I am a big fan of Sparks. His books are about love, romance despair and heartache. I finished this book in two afternoons after working all day. This story is about John Tyree who falls in love with a beautiful girl named Savannah while he is on leave from the military. They share a passionate romance before John must leave and return to the military. He promises to come back at his enlistments end and share his life with Savannah. As fate would have it things just don't work out as we plan. There are many twists and turns and the ending is not the one I hoped for. I have read everything Sparks has written and must say that I have never had any regrets, because I know his book will hold my interest.
0446567337|5.0|I bought this for my daughter, who is almost 16 yrs old.  She hates to read so we have a problem with that.  However, she saw this movie and is almost all the way through with the book and says it is much better than the movie.  She says it is a great book.  That's saying something coming from her. :)
B001PR0YGC|3.0|Matt Damon does a superb job of playing Mr. Whitacre. This man Mr. Whitacre could not keep his mouth shut to the detriment of all involved with him, from his family to his coworkers to the FBI agents.    I liked this movie but did not love it. I found it very slow at times. The story could have been consolidated for a qicker paced movie.
B0000UJL96|2.0|Well it was.  Following along that old time tradition of labeling the odd-numbered Star Treks as inferior to the even-numbered ones, I set myself up for failure with the 1st, 3rd, and 5th, and got varying degrees of just that.<br /><br />But I may have been far too generous in watching this film, due to its being even-numbered, and made by the same director who made Wrath of Khan.<br /><br />I can't precisely point out just where or why, but this entire film felt like it was missing several hours of exposition, perhaps backstory from episodes of \\"The Next Generation\\" I never saw, and I end up feeling completely lost and confused, even in the face of the obvious.<br /><br />The story claims to be some sort of \\"Cold War in Space!\\" idea, yet perhaps my being born in 1988 and never experiencing the Cold War leads me to not really understand this concept.  I can definitely see it, but I can't FEEL it.<br /><br />The story involves some kind of planetary explosion that threatens to destroy the Klingon Empire, so a Klingon ambassador goes to the Federation to try to negotiate a lasting peace treaty and an opening of the two nations to work together and help them.  For reasons of \\"DRAMA!\\", Kirk is inexplicably racist against Klingons.  This is explained via that old Red Herring, David, his son who was killed by the Klingons.  In my original review for Search for Spock, I praised this as a show of Christopher Lloyd's Klingon guy's menace and its immediate effect on Kirk, which of course could not be as powerful as the loss of Spock, given that Kirk never really knew David.<br /><br />But after watching the entire Original Series, and seeing Kirk's almost friendly relationship with enemy Klingons, this sudden fanatic, racist hatred of them in Star Trek VI really does seem to come out of nowhere.  I mirrored Spock in feeling sudden confusion and shock at Kirk's inexplicable hatred of Klingons.<br /><br />And for some reason, I never really feel as though this hatred is anything more than a Red Herring, or otherwise a plot device that never really ends up fully utilized by the script.  He hates Klingons, yes, but this never in any way forces him to confront his racism or compromise his principles due to racism (or overcoming that racism), and in the end Kirk just handsomes his way through the events without really learning anything beyond the cheap and tawdry after-school special \\"Well I know now that Klingons don't ALL really want to hurt us, so I'll stop being racist!\\" message.<br /><br />Racism is NOT a jealousy or a grudge or something cheap and tawdry that can be resolved by a single moment or sheer willpower.  It can definitely be world-changing for a racist to have someone of the other race do something for or to them to completely change their view, but this movie has nothing at all like that---there are no Klingons who really affect Kirk in this way, not even the ambassador who confides in Kirk, up to his own death.<br /><br />The main storyline involves an assassination of the Ambassador by people dressed as Federation crewmembers, coming after the apparent attack on the Ambassador's ship by the Enterprise, though the Enterprise did not fire.  This leads to Kirk and McCoy being arrested by the Klingons (as they left the ship to go help the Ambassador afterwards) and them being sentenced to a prison planet after being incompetently defended by Colonel Worf (played by Michael Dorn, but not the same Worf as in TNG).<br /><br />So we get an entire long and dreadfully dull sequence of Kirk and McCoy on a snowy prison planet, tangling with a shapeshifter, escaping, only to be betrayed by her and caught by the Klingons.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Spock begins to uncover the conspiracy of the Ambassador's assassination, and for the life of me it just.. makes.. NO.. SENSE!!!<br /><br />I fail to see the logic behind any of the motives behind the revealed conspirators, including a purely reverse-race based decision to cast the Admiral played by Brock Peters (who is black, btw) as the main racist against Klingons.  The documentaries I saw seemed to vaguely imply that this decision was made based on some sort of attempt to show racism in an ironic sort of light, given that the black guy is one of the highest ranking people in Starfleet and is racist against similar brown (alien) people.<br /><br />But the entire thing just makes NO SENSE!  So he's racist, but WHY does he want to assassinate the Ambassador?  Is he looking to provoke war with the Klingons?  If so, WHY?  Unless the Klingons are as stupid as they've been gradually shaped into being (as in, from TOS slick and smarmy clever bastards to TNG proud warrior race guys who hold honor above reason), then there's no concievable way the Federation could go to war with the Klingons and expect not to be horribly butchered, even if they win the war.  Maybe the Romulans would emerge and smash the shattered remnants of the Federation?  Maybe the Dominion would launch a lightning strike against them?<br /><br />There's a thousand and eight logical and rational reasons NOT to go to war with the Klingons, but the racism against the Klingons is played up to a fanatical degree that is not only arbitrary (as the characters involved in this conspiracy, without revealing their identities, have absolutely nothing in their brief backstory or personality to support or justify this) but they seem to be incapable of realizing that THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE MAJORITY OF THE KLINGONS WANT!<br /><br />Why else would General Chang, played by Christopher Plummer (who absolutely has a damn BLAST playing this guy, and hams it up so much he chews up more scenery than Shatner in three Star Trek films) and his group be working so closely with the heads of STARFLEET COMMAND to do this?<br /><br />Star Trek Deep Space Nine had an episode called \\"In the Pale Moonlight\\" about how, in the midst of the Dominion War, the Federation was losing horribly.  Casualties mounted every day, and the crew of Deep Space Nine could look horribly forward to looking through the daily casualties to find the names of friends, family, and loved ones killed in the war.  This leads to Captain Sisko facing a crisis, as the Romulans have a high-ranking Senator looking to persuade the Empire to joining the Dominion in crushing the Federation.<br /><br />So Sisko has a Cardassian spy work with a forger to create a false holo-recording of top Dominion officials apparently scheming to secretly attack the Romulans while they're recovering from a botched attack on the Federation before.  They hope to use this lie to bring the Romulans in against the Dominion.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that Senator recognizes its a fake, and leaves to go back to Romulus, undoubtedly with renewed hatred for the Federation for this latest attempt.  Instead, the Cardassian spy has his ship blow up, making it look like a Dominion job, and ensuring the Romulans will find the fake holorecording.<br /><br />Sisko realizes he has the blood of the Senator and others on his hands now, as he has betrayed Starfleet principles by engaging in shady dealings, bribery, threats, and indirect murder.  And yet he can live with it because he did what he thought was right, and the war will soon turn with the Romulans to reinforce the Federation side.<br /><br />This episode created immense controversy, as detractors claimed it went completely against Gene Roddenberry's vision of Star Trek as a peaceful, utopian future of exploration and diplomacy.<br /><br />And it was one of the highest rated Star Trek episodes ever.<br /><br />Shockingly, there's no such similar controversy about this movie, in which Starfleet ADMIRALS (and not just Captains) are in on a conspiracy to assassinate not only a Klingon Ambassador, but the FEDERATION PRESIDENT not out of any righteous need to end a losing war or stop a killing spree or crime, but to CAUSE a losing war, a killing spree, a crime.  They seek to unleash a war between the Federation and the Klingons in which undoubtedly the Klingons would lose... and kill MILLIONS if not BILLIONS of Federation soldiers and civilians.<br /><br />And all because of racism/hatred that up until then had never made itself even slightly known, and even when it was revealed, did not make a lick of sense.<br /><br />Also, it was pretty boring.find the names of friends, family, and loved ones killed in the war.

B00003CX5P|4.0|George Lucas was rusty for the first installment of the Star Wars prequel trilogy. From 1984 to 1998, there were no Star Wars movies. Was it because George was waiting for technology to catch up, so he could make the type of movie that he envisioned in the early 70's? Whatever the case, Episode I has many frustrating moments, and some cool and relevant sequences that tell the story well. First, the bad: Starting with the script.....this movie isn't one that the average person is going to memorize, because it isn't simplistic like episodes 4, 5, and 6. Did George deliberately make the script a sophisticated one, to go with the high tech environment? With so much sophistication in the environment, as well as all of the high-tech gadgets, etc., could one really say, &#34;Can someone get this big walking carpet out of my way?&#34; Sure, life was simpler and more tangible a few decades ago, and movies were a reflection of it. The problem with The Phantom Menace is that there's too much emphasis on certain scenes, such as the pod races, and droid battles. A large chunk of the movie is spent highlighting Anakin's talents, but nothing in the form of depicting any hint of forthcoming evil that would contribute to his downfall in the next two films. I found myself getting bored during the pod race sequence, because too much time was spent on the special effects. Furthermore, was the pod race sequence even necessary? In my opinion, this sequence has absolutely no relevance to anything in subsequent movies. Why are Anakin's pilot skills so important to depict? He barely uses them in subsequent movies, and when he does, it is devoid of anything memorable or interesting. I believe in telling a part of a story in a much shorter format, and not dwell on it, such as the Jabba the Hutt sequence in Return of the Jedi. The Phantom Menace doesn't move along as efficiently as episodes 4-6, and boredom is the result. Boredom also stems from not initially following the sophisticated (and somewhat complicated) script. Like I mentioned, it isn't as tangible as one would want when it comes to the Star Wars franchise, which I think is a reflection of the times, as well as George's vision. It's very interesting that this movie (despite its complexities) is more or less a kid's movie. Now, the good: I certainly like the much higher level of skill that the jedi knights and sith lords display in lightsaber duels. Darth Maul is spectacular, and it is the duel with Qui-Gon that actually saves this movie from plunging into the abyss. I can't help but laugh when seeing the lightsaber duel between Obi-Wan and Darth Vader in Episode 4--It was absolutely PATHETIC in terms of skill level. I know that Darth and Obi-Wan are older then, but their skill level is very inferior to what we see in 1,2,3,5, and 6. But George gets away with these things, and the loyal fans don't mind. I like the fact that he built the jedis and siths into skilled warriors, but it represents one of several things that don't transition well in subsequent films. Again, we give George a free pass. It's too bad that Yoda is a puppet in this one, and looks so different from the Yoda in the rest of the movies. This movie lacks attitude, for the most part, but it's understandable in a way, because it features a child, and the story has to be built around that. The musical score is fantastic as usual, as John Williams turns out another masterpiece that's a lot different from the the first 3 movies. I particularly like the music during the lightsaber battles.  The Phantom Menace is a movie that I've come to appreciate a little more in the past few years, after the next two movies were completed. I expect its popularity to grow a little in the coming years. Despite several areas of frustration, I still give this movie 4 stars, because of the cool environments and Darth Maul, who by the way should've been kept around for one more film. Oh well.  7.75/10omewhat complicated) script.

0446567337|5.0|I had never read anything Nicholas Sparks has written until yesterday. I started this book and finished it in less than 24 hours. It was an easy read with likeable characters who I felt an immediate connection with. I would love to read a sequel to this one, if Sparks were ever so inclined to write one! This is the first book I've read since finishing the Twilight Saga at the beginning of February that I really couldn't put down...and I've read about 5  books in between. I laughed & cried, and if a book can draw that kind of emotion, it must be a good one. I highly recommend.
B002WY65VU|2.0|I didn't quite know what to expect from Zombieland and expected something similar to Sean of the Dead. It had a good cast and the first 10 minutes were great. Unfortunately the film was all downhill from there and dragged on another 100 minutes to its entirely predictable conclusion.<br /><br />The movie really couldn't make up its mind on what it wanted to be: romantic comedy, slapstick, horror light, and the viewing audience suffered for it.<br /><br />At least I didn't see it in the theaters.
0307266303|4.0|\\"Born to Run\\" is a revolutionary book containing an invaluable message that could change the way you think about running forever. Unfortunately, this message is buried within 282 pages of rambling narrative filled with improbable characters and punctuated with hyperbole on nearly every page.     By the time I had reached chapter 8, I had tired of the narrative and was wishing the author would simply get to the point. Where was the great stuff about \\"the joy of running\\" that other reviewers had said they'd found in this book? Where was that eye-opening screed against Nike as the company that had single-handedly destroyed running for an entire generation of runners? So I did a little digging, and I found the two chapters that addressed these topics. They were terrific! I found a couple other good ones too, that had little or nothing to do with the narrative. Then I basically skipped the remainder of the book.     As far as I'm concerned, the \\"must-read\\" chapters in this book are chapters 15, 25, 27 and 28.     Chapter 15 speaks about running for the pure joy of it. The Tarahumara Indians of Mexico who make up the main characters of this book evidently are a tribe who never forgot what a joy it is simply to run! This chapter talks about where running goes wrong for most of us - how it is that something so joyful can so easily devolve into a chore or a contest, and also how it is that America lost its dominance in distance running as soon as money entered the equation. The chapter equates love of running with love of life. It is an inspiring and thought provoking read.    Chapter 25 describes the devastating effect that Nike's invention of the running shoe has had on the sport of running, dramatically escalating the rates of injury that people suffer from running. This astonishing chapter, to me, would be enough to make buying the whole book worthwhile. The chapter cites several studies that have shown that the more expensive a running shoe you buy, the MORE likely youare to suffer running injuries! The heavily-padded and rigidly constructed cocoons that pass for modern running shoes have robbed the foot of the ability to do the things it was designed to do for the runner. As a result the foot becomes weak and out of shape, and injuries result. The heavily padded heel also has changed the stride of the modern runner to a long, heel-striking stride that is destructive to the joints no matter how heavily padded the shoe. Prior to this invention, runners ran on the outsides and balls of their feet, and injuries were substantially lower. Nike itself seems to have finally caught on to this by designing a new kind of running shoe (called the \\"Free\\") with minimal padding and support.    Unfortunately, most of the medical establishment has evidently not yet caught up to these truths, according to the author. He cited expert after expert who all sang the same tune that \\"running is hard on the feet and joints\\" and \\"our bodies were not made for running.\\" They generally counseled buying expensive running shoes or even more costly orthotics, or else giving up running as a sport altogether. Thankfully, there are also a few more enlightened medical experts out there, also cited in the book, who paint an entirely different story. The human foot is a marvel of engineering. It is only our tinkering with its environment (by encasing it in supports it doesn't need) that have made it seem so ill suited for what it was made to do.    Chapter 27 details how the author, a tall and heavy-boned man who had perpetually been plagued with joint problems and injuries when trying to run even short distances, was finally able to overcome these difficulties and become a distance runner by completely reworking his stride. This chapter includes a useful mention of three very similar running styles that all have books out detailing them, called Evolution Running, Chi Running, and the POSE method. These methods all stress getting rid of our overpadded running shoesand running more on the balls of the feet rather than landing on the heels, with short quick strides, keeping your weight centered above your feet. There is enough information in this chapter to help someone experiment with these methods, but from what I've read elsewhere it takes time and practice to master any one of them, and the reader would be best advised to refer to one of the books or videos available through Amazon that teach these techniques if the desire is to master this type of running style. Chapter 27 also talks about how the author switched to a much healthier, mostly vegan diet, and the positive effects that came from doing this.    Chapter 28 is an overly-long but nevertheless interesting development of a theory that humans evolved to be long-distance running machines. The author spends a good bit of time quoting various experts and presenting evidence to support this theory. While humans are nowhere near the fastest land animals in a short race, we exceed all other species in our ability to run long distances. The theory is that this would allow a hunter on foot to catch speedier prey simply by chasing them over long distances until they fall exhausted. The title of the book, \\"Born to Run\\", comes out of this chapter, making the case that we should all be runners because, after all, we are built to do exactly that.    I would advise busy readers to either buy this book used or else check it out of the library, and start by reading perhaps the first few chapters just to get the background of the narrative that winds its way through the book. If you find that the narrative appeals to you then you will probably want to just read the whole thing cover to cover. If, like me, you find the narrative to be not worth the time, then skip to chapters 15, 25, 27 and 28. These chapters are definitely worth the reading, and may change the way you think about running as a sport for yourself, especially if injuries have hindered you from running in the past.     Iwill let the final words of Chapter 28 sum up the value of this book: \\"So simple... Just move your legs. Because if you don't think you were born to run, you're not only denying history. You're denying who you are.\\" This book has definitely inspired me to get back on my feet and try running again, after having given up on running because I thought my joints could not take it.

B001GCUER0|3.0|This series still provides compelling viewing but some of the edge of the first season has worn off.<br /><br />We are back in the heart of Madison Ave in 1962 but the action in this series spreads out into the characters' lives outside the office. It's become a soap opera. What made the first season so enjoyable was seeing the ad men at work, creating their products. Now we get a lot of marital strife, affairs, breakups, a weird back-story and other stuff that's way less interesting.<br /><br />One plus is the way the writers depict the frustrations of women. You see the roots of women's liberation before it even has a name. You feel it in the boredom and wasted potential and in the blind disregard of men.<br /><br />I'll continue watching and hoping this series doesn't jump the shark too soon. But the danger is there.

B002SJIO4A|1.0|Let me start by saying, I'm a woman who enjoys some science fiction and many guy-type movies.  I loved Blade Runner and all the Alien movies, liked Videodrome and A Boy and His Dog.  I love the 3 Stooges and own both Jackass movies.      So I was all set to like this movie, or at least view it with thoughtfulness and an open mind.  Or, maybe, just be entertained.  Nothing wrong with that.    Was I ever in for a shock.  Talk about cinematic crap.  Aside from the special effects, I found nothing to redeem this movie.    About halfway, maybe two thirds of the way through, I simply turned my eyes from the screen and stared at the wall for the rest of the film.  Not because the violence bothered me -- please -- but simply because I was sick of seeing the same thing, again, and again, and again, and again.    However I did listen to the rest of the movie, and for reasons I'll give below, I don't think I missed anything and that I can still provide a valid review.    Here are the movie's messages.  They're quite simple, as you can see.    *  Old white men in suits are evil.    *  Army colonels are evil.    *  Humans mistreat those who are different.    Now, before the fans  start hollering:  yes, I am aware that all of the above are true -- sometimes.  But in D9, they're always true.  There are no shades of gray, no subtleties, no mitigating circumstances, no questions raised, no thoughts provoked.  Of course the above statements have their place in movies, books, whatever.  But for cripe's sake I want an author/director who puts some thought into the work, who presents different dimensions.  With D9 I felt I was watching a chimpanzee slap paint on a wall.    I tired of it very quickly, and found the wall much more interesting to study.    Now, why do I feel that, even with my eyes shut, I missed nothing of importance?  Because I kept hearing the following elements.  Repeatedly.  Until I felt they were etched in acid on my brain:    1.  Weapon fire and explosions.    2.  Splats.     3.  Clicks, grunts, croaks, that were the prawns vocalizing.      4.  Shouted dialogue, consisting of variations on the word \\"fook.\\"  \\"fookin hell!\\"  \\"What the fook ya doin!\\" etc.    5.  String instrument orchestrations.     6.  Phone-baloney, semi operatic, wailing, quavering vocalizations, sometimes over a background composed of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  I assumed that at these times something serious was going on.    The above six elements happened in no particular order, sometimes two or three went on at once, but it was basically the same sounds, repeated ad nauseum.  The soundtrack for this movie must have been the easiest one in the world to compose.  A person could mark six sides of a die/dice, and toss it a hundred times, and come up with a soundtrack for District 9.    See it if you must, but don't say I didn't warn you.
0547258305|3.0|PARENTAL WARNING!!!    This book has premarital sexual content in a few different places.  Nothing very descriptive, but its there.  There is also violence, but again, nothing very graphic.  The problem that many parents will have is the message about sex and marriage.  The message about sex is that its ok to have sex out of marriage- though the heroine, Katsa, did consider the ramifications before taking her lover, Po, into her bed (forest bed as it were).  There is a plant that she can take to prevent pregnancy, but there is no mention of her using it until after she's already slept with him.  The message about marriage is quite negative. Katsa believes that marriage, even to a man who fully respects her and has no intention of holding her back, would mean a loss of her self and her independence.  Aside from that, the overall message that women are just as capable as men, and that women can be just as independent is quite prevalent.  However for me, as a concerned parent, I felt that the message could have been delivered in a more positive light without ragging on marriage or being so liberal with the views on sex.  Other parents may disagree and approve of the delivery of the message, but this warning is for those who might not.    Otherwise, a pretty good story and likable characters.  Style is very simple- nothing fancy or colorful, easy to follow and read.  That was a bit boring for me at times, but this is categorized as \\"Young Adult\\". Often had the feeling that the heroine was going to come to some new understanding of herself, children, or marriage, but she never does- that was sometimes frustrating and disappointing.  Felt like the story was left up in the air.  Many things appear to be unresolved.  Perhaps there will be a follow up?  There is a second book in the \\"series\\", but it is not a continuation of this story.  \\"Fire\\" has all new characters save for one.
B00275EGX8|5.0|Saw this movie for pre order at BB three days before release day. Never saw the movie in theatres so I was contemplating if I should get it or not. I saw and read all the good reviews and I said, this will be a blind buy for me.So I went to BB on release day and ended up getting the Blu-Ray steelbook version went home and watched my movie and I have no regrets.Loved it.I guess it pays sometimes to blind buy.And love the steelbook too which was close to being sold out before the end of the day.Who would have thought that the movie that I had just got is now the best picture and best director.
B0034GK7DM|5.0|After some thought, I finally decided to pick up this CD because I really liked \\"A Little More Country Than That\\". This is a great debut CD, my faves are \\"Roll With It\\" \\"Don't Ask Me About A Woman\\", and \\"The Way Love Looks\\".    I also realized how much he sounds like George Strait! He might be the next George if his future work has material like this! 5 Stars!!
B0001CNRBG|5.0|When I realized that many of my lady friends had never seen this movie, I bought it from Amazon.com and had a \\"girls' afternoon out\\", with a bottomless pitcher of Sangria and loads of popcorn.  We are all still talking about what fun that afternoon was, and we vowed to do it again with another classic movie.  I just love that I can go online to Amazon and usually find exactly what I want, and it's affordable.  Thanks!
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I was hooked after watching the first season. I missed a few shows and bought the first season.  Once the second Season went on sale I had to have it too.  The classic episodes are in this season. Paper Scissors Rock Lizard Spock love that one.  And Penny is easy on the eyes.  What more do you want.  Buy it.
B0024FADAQ|5.0|If you are looking for state of the art special effects go elsewere. This movie used ground breaking effects for the time but they are dated by todays standards. But once you look at the meat of the movie you see that it is every little boys dream to go into space and do battle with the aliens and save the universe. I loved The Last Starfighter the first time I saw it, and at age 55 I still love it as a fun movie that makes me a little boy again.  Dave D.
0307266303|5.0|I read the reviews for this book, and one of them said,\\"changed my life.\\"  I went in this story extremely sceptical that a book could change my life.  I was very wrong.  This book has, indeed, changed my life as it will yours.  It is not just a motivational story.  It is much more than that.  I have been in the military for eight years, and it is a shame that I just started to really learn how to run after reading this book.  Everyone needs to read this book.  thank you C.M.
B000683VI4|3.0|Read the book, I enjoyed it much more than the movie. The movie is abridged plus added material which isn't in the book. If you like Hollywood drama is one thing but the book goes into detail which relates to real life and gives you a feeling of essence of life and what it is to love another human being. Nicholas Sparks is an exceptional writer. Every time I read the Notebook I cry as if it is my first time. I will mention in passing I saw the movie \\"A Walk to Remember\\" and also read the book. There too the movie is much more removed from the book (than the Notebook) with a lot left out. To be in sync with real life better read the books than to buy the dvd's!

B0035J6TAI|1.0|So you know where I'm coming from, I'm a Peter Gabriel fan from way back. I was at his first-ever solo concert at the Capitol Theatre in NJ back in 1977 (Television was the opening act). I went to every tour after that for years.<br /><br />Each song is slow and melancholy and one song from the album would serve well as a slow break during a live concert, where Gabriel might stop and play something on the piano.<br /><br />Collectively, however, the album is painful to listen to. Gabriel takes other people's songs and sucks the life out of them, turning them into depressing funeral dirges. I understand the impetus for a musician to try something new, but I don't understand putting it onto CD and selling it when the experiment has clearly failed on such a grand scale.<br /><br />--------------<br /><br />3/16/14 Reviewer's note: I just went over this review and saw that I gave it two stars. It really deserves zero stars, so I am downgrading my review to one star. I have not felt the need to listen to this music again since the first play. I would ask the people who gave this CD five stars when it was released how many times have they felt the need to listen to this album in the last two years. I would bet the answer was somewhere between none and none.

0307269760|4.0|Love Munro; loved the book.  Amazing work, as usual.  \\"Child's Play\\" is one of the most haunting and brilliantly crafted stories I have ever read.  And it's great to see Munro, at 78, striking off into new territory in the title story.  But one question has been obsessing me.  I've carefully read \\"Wenlock Edge\\" twice now but cannot figure out the meaning of the bit at the end when the narrator mails Ernie's address to Mr. Purvis.  Can anyone help?
0307341569|5.0|Yes, Gillian Flynn's novels are very dark. With that said, her stories are not just sinister without reason. The characters are grim, but develop beautifully -- the reader is able to learn more about them and the plot with each chapter.    I enjoyed the plot as well. Towards the end I got a sense of the mystery, but the author still manages to wait until the last second to reveal yet another twist. Definitley well worth it and I look forward to more from her.

B00003CX8Y|5.0|My husband's aunt bought this movie for me as a Christmas present. It was shipped from somewhere in Indonesia (I think). When she finally got it (late) she tried to play it to make sure it worked and nothing happened. She had to clean it to get it to work and when it did a screen came up that gave you four or five languages to choose from. When you select English it goes to the options to play, etc. If you look at the picture on the dvd case you can see it was copied and printed (good quality print) and both copies she bought had the same UPC code. The movie plays fine but it seems like they just make copies of an original disk.

0545140315|4.0|The Lonely Hearts Club is such a cute, feel good kinda book! A book that I REALLY want my 10 year old daughter to read...it's about coming of age, learning that boys are not always all they are cracked up to be, and that even if you do decide to date, a boy should NEVER EVER replace a friend or come before a friend, or for that matter come before you!<br /><br />Elizabeth Eulberg did such an amazing job capturing this age group, and Penny being in love with the Beatles is just to perfect! I loved her quirkiness, and her strength. She's such a unique dynamic character that I was happy to see had many facets to her personality!<br /><br />The one flaw I found with in the pages of The Lonely Hearts Club is the amount of characters - with it being a \\"club\\" of course everyone joins! Which is great for Penny, and for her club, but it also makes it tough for the reader to keep up with. It also made it hard to really get to know anyone other than Penny.<br /><br />Though, it was fun reading about the guys with in the pages of the book...It was totally nice to see some of the traits that guys of that age often have...that not every guy is just out for love...there are some pigs out there, we all know that - and Elizabeth Eulberg was not afraid to show that side! It was refreshing!<br /><br />With her debut novel Elizabeth Eulberg has given herself a high standard which to live up to...I really loved the cutsiness of The Lonely Hearts Club, not to mention the heart felt story with in it's pages. It was a laugh out loud kind of book with a sweet message for young girls everywhere!
B002M1OWYK|1.0|This review doesn't concern the content of the book, but rather the accuracy of this particular seller's ad for it.  I ordered this and what I received was not the 1925 edition as advertised in both the copyright date and the photo.  Instead, I got a book that was printed to fill my order.  I know because I ordered it on February 24, 2010, and it has a printed date on the back page of March 2, 2010.  I have no problem with the made-to-order business model, but the seller should make it clear that that's the case up front.    I like to collect old books, so I was very disappointed in this.  There were dozens of other sellers on Amazon from whom I could have bought a newer copy, but I chose this one because I wanted the older one.  Shame on this seller for using such deceptive sales tactics.

B002VECM4K|2.0|Yes, overrated crap. I give this one two stars on the strength of Monique's performance. Many times we have seen this story of abused and underprivileged youth making good in the world, only those other films had a point.  Technically, I've seen better films shot on super 8mm. There was even one shot in the classroom where I saw the boom/microphone enter frame. And if I have to see that same trailer again, the one with Precious blubbering about how unloved she is, I'm going to sue the studio.
B0020TS5LK|3.0|First up, I'm commenting on the ALLIANCE release of this film... UPC 065935827108, cat.#110203  (should a New Line release follow, this review will not apply)<br /><br />After reading several reviews of Alliance's releases here on Amazon, I feel that a few things should be noted about the releasing company that has released this film (and many others) on Blu-ray in Canada PRIOR to a US Release.<br /><br />ALLIANCE (formerly Alliance/Atlantis) is a distribution company in Canada that holds exclusive rights to distribute films made by a good handful of major US studios (New Line Cinema, Miramax, Weinstein, to name a few).  Alliance is responsible for Canadian distribution of both theatrical film presentations as well as home-video releases of their US partners.<br /><br />Alliance's rights to release extend ONLY to the film itself, or to any current release version made available by the originating US counterpart, and does not extend to re-mastering the original source material.<br /><br />That being said, when a Blu-ray version of a film (such as this one) is not made available in the US, then Alliance only has rights to encode it for release on the format, and NOTHING ELSE.<br /><br />If/When the US counterpart (in this case, New Line Cinema) decides to release their edition, then Alliance will be the distributor in Canada for that \\"re-issue\\" as well, and will then be able to transport the exact source made for the later release.<br /><br />So, any reviewer complaining about lack of bonus content or transfer concerns needs to take the above into consideration.<br /><br />The simple fact that Alliance is releasing it at all means that they are taking an initiative to release the film in the Blu-ray format.<br /><br />That being said... There is inherintly nothing wrong with this Blu-ray release of Blade.  Yes, there are some minor artifacting issues, and there is a presence of original film 'grain' (but this is a dark movie, that is bound to happen, AND film grain is a NATURAL exisiting element in the transfer.  It's FAR better than an upscaled DVD version (I dont know why that claim was made by in an earlier review... compared side by side, the two arent even close.)<br /><br />The DTS-HD Master Audio Track is sharp and distinctly (and appropriately) directional as it should be.<br /><br />IS this a perfect release? no... Do I wish it had (at least) the same bonus content as the DVD release? of course I do... but I know the limitations Alliance has (as noted above) -- But the release is still decent all in all. I agree it's not worth the current thirty dollar asking price.  But I picked up the complete trilogy at a retail location here in Canada for thirty bucks... more than a valid price point for all three movies.<br /><br />For now, if you are a Blade fan, and you can fetch it for a decent price, there is nothing wrong with movie-only release.ter than an upscaled DVD version (I dont know why that claim was made by in an earlier review... compared side by side, the two arent even close.)

B000OCXF0Q|5.0|Avril Lavigne is my favorite singer in the whole world. She is truly original,and has a different style of music that is all her own. Her vocals are really superb on every track. While listening to this album you can hear the raw-emotion and effort she puts into her music.        \\"The Best Damn Thing\\" being her third album is different, but just as superb as her two previous releases \\"Let Go\\" and \\"Under My Skin.\\" \\"The Best Damn Thing\\" takes you to a completely different level of the music that Avril is able to make, and to see her continuous talent that is absoulete perfection. All of the songs are terrific and as with all of her albums you never have to skip over any of the songs, because they are good songs.        The bonus dvd with this deluxe edition is such a delightful bonus for all of us fans of Avril Lavigne to watch...You get to see in depth look at Avril recording \\"The Best Damn Thing\\" and how she came up with some of the lyrics for the album. It is also really cool to see Avril skateboarding outside of the studio where the album was being made. It's so amazing to see Avril in the studio, sitting down with her producer, and talking about writing and recording the songs. Just like listening to Avril is a delight, so is watching her.        I give this album five stars, because every song is just wonderful and completely flawless.Avril Lavigne always makes terrific music that us fans of hers always enjoy,are never disappointed with her music,and keep wanting more. Avril Lavigne rocks, and she will always will forever!
B001TH8UUA|4.0|I've been using two of these cables with both a blu ray player and for cable television for about three weeks now. The quality of audio and video has been equal to several premium cables which I already had.    Nothing annoys me more than when I get a piece of electronic equipment and then I have to spend five minutes with a knife and scissors cutting the plastic packaging off of it. The frustration free packaging that amazon features is great, you just open the shipping box and you are ready to go.    I would highly recommend this product, it's a very good value and is very easy to open.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Much like similarities between [[ASIN:B0012Q732O 10,000 B.C.]] and [[ASIN:B000NOKFHQ Apocalypto]], where the former is a near exact replica of the latter, Avatar is a near facsimile of [[ASIN:B002CYIR1Q Dances With Wolves]].  In both comparative cases, this is not necessarily a slight, because each of the four films is very good, if not great.  It is, however, a bit lazy and heavy-handed.  Avatar may be one of the best movies of 2009 - if not THE best - but it's as predictable as a sunrise.<br /><br />Light years away from Earth in the distant future, a planet called Pandora has been discovered.  On this planet exists a wide array of exotic flora and fauna, indigenous people known as the Na'vi (more later), and incredibly valuable ore humans wish to extract.  Initial intentions are both scientific and humanitarian; exchanging knowledge, sharing in cultural understanding, providing advanced medicine.  To further this objective, the human race has created a method to splice DNA from humans and aliens creating actual Na'vi beings mentally controllable from connection pods (aka futuristic coffins with [[ASIN:B0006VSX1Q Therapeutic Head Scalp Massagers]]).  When the largest deposit of precious material is discovered in the Na'vi woodland and underneath an unfathomably massive tree that links the inhabitants to a physical and spiritual solidarity - an ecological Mecca to the Na'vi - the confrontation between military backed corporate greed and resistance to cultural extinction becomes nearly inevitable (breakout the smallpox blankets!).  In rolls Jake (Sam Worthington) - a paraplegic war veteran substituting for his recently murdered brother - given three months to resolve the situation diplomatically (read: get the Na'vi to leave) through the usage of his own Na'vi avatar.  Flown into action by helicopter pilot Trudy Chacon (Michelle Rodriguez), and accompanied by the resident Na'vi expert Dr. Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) - essentially Diane Fossey for blue \\"gorillas\\" - Jake soon encounters trouble with the unnatural surroundings, gets separated from others, and runs into Na'vi Princess Neytiri (Zoe Saldana).<br /><br />From there it's EXACTLY as you expect: Jake confuses priorities, attaches to his new culture, earns alien trust, finds an obvious love interest, hears nearly impossible Na'vi lore, betrays his new family, accomplishes the previously thought impossible, and leads the way in a massive battle of \\"good\\" versus \\"evil.\\"<br /><br />Combining a brisk story with a classical folk tale, James Cameron has created wonderful support the real star of this movie: The visuals.  Put simply, this is the most awe-inspiring visual spectacle ever created.  Ever.  Stunningly beautiful, even a plant or a bug can cause \\"oohs\\" and \\"aahs,\\" reality and CGI blend seamlessly; even the people voicing the characters seem to match perfectly.  Add in the incredible usage of 3D - not used for the cheap \\"throw things at the screen\\" effect - and it's a visual feast unabsorbable in one viewing.  That's the good.<br /><br />The bad aspects of this film, however, are a bit unnerving.  As mentioned, the similarities to Dances with Wolves are so ubiquitous that the movie may as well have been titled \\"Dances with Na'vi.\\"  From the foreign feeling to the Indian hoops and yips, the cultural immersion to the acceptance and connection, the animal and environment connection, the mohawks and adornments, it's a nearly identical Native American story with more parallels than worth mentioning; for crying out loud, Wes Studi voices the Na'vi Chief!<br /><br />The other major flaw of this film is the characterization of good versus evil, and how the message gets heavy-handedly applied without real critical analysis.  The good guys are the pacifists and the scientists, and the bad guys are greedy military and corporate types.  The Marine Colonel responsible for most of the evil may as well have been named Col. Bad Guy in the credits.  With references to the \\"hearts andminds,\\" \\"shock and awe,\\" and the fact that the Na'vi are called terrorists, it's a sloppy reference to U.S. military action of recent history.  The mineral \\"unobtainium\\" (read: oil) is what the blue (read: red and/or brown) Na'vi unknowingly protect, and they are better off without our (read: the U.S.) help and intervention (read: Western influence).  To be quite honest, it's intellectually lazy and I'd appreciate avoiding the political sermon while I'm trying to be whisked off into fantasy scenarios where there are blue Indians, mutant dogs with 437 razor-sharp teeth, giant Stay Puft Marshmallow men rampaging cities, oilmen drilling into asteroids, gorgeous women created by ancient computers, time traveling Deloreans, self-aware computers, and every 80s movie in which Keith Gordon is inexplicably the male lead.<br /><br />I can't blame Cameron, and I actually like the movie quite a bit.  Despite the flaws, and the incredibly simple, foreshadowed story, the technical aspects cannot be overlooked, the visuals worth 5 stars on their own merit.  Subtract the politics and the anti-military angle, and it's a 4.6 star movie worth rewatching (round it up to 5).that the Na'vi are called terrorists, it's a sloppy reference to U.S. military action of recent history.

B00328G4V6|4.0|The sound quality on these newly mixed 40 year old tapes is great.  And Jimi absolutely RIPS on some of the tracks, which is one thing I never get tired of hearing.  \\"Mr. Bad Luck\\" sounds very out of place on this CD and should've been given a miss.  Also on other tracks some heavy editing has taken place, including dropping in background vocals and guitar solos from other Hendrix recordings (Stone Free).  However this was probably largely unavoidable in order to bring us this much 'new' Hendrix which overall sounds fantastic both in terms of the band's performances and the audio fidelity.  It's not hard to second-guess some of the choices made on this release but it's still an exciting and enjoyable release...

B002S0OBN2|4.0|Just finished enjoying the two hours thirteen minutes of \\"Love Never Dies\\". As a sequel , it has many great moments , however one must be familiar with the original (and who isn't) to truly enjoy it's splendor.  I won't rehash what other reviewers have said , but there is one point I want to bring up. In the notes about the recording , Webber states that he only \\"with one short exception\\" uses a melody famous from \\"Phantom\\". Whereas it is true that several snippets of the original appear throughout \\"Love Never Dies\\" from a few bars , to several passages. This enhances the whole work , and is a welcome addition.  It would be unfair to compare this cast to the original , it is 20 years later , and each has it's merits.  All in all a very beautiful follow-up. Never short of a pretty melody , Webber has once again crafted a fine work of art.
080701429X|5.0|The last 10 years has been a real struggle, and as I go through life trying to find ways to cope and stay happy, I ran across this book.  Heard about it many years ago and always wanted to read it.  I HIGHLY recommend that everyone read this.  It's a very interesting psychological look at the people who survived the Nazi death camps in particular, but in general, is a good resource for anyone going through a hard time.  It looks at the coping mechanisms of those who survived, and the mindset of those who gave up, and reminds us all that even when everything including our very identity is taken away, we still have something that NO ONE can take unless we let them - how we will deal with our challenges.  Will we give up and give in, defeated; or will we choose to look past the bad stuff at the sunset, the puppy's eyes, the pretty flowers and see that there is still good stuff in the world.    This book, along with [[ASIN:055380703X Awakening Joy: 10 Steps That Will Put You on the Road to Real Happiness]] and [[ASIN:039952990X How We Choose to Be Happy: The 9 Choices of Extremely Happy People--Their Secrets, Their Stories]] are excellent textbooks on how to bring more joy back into your life.    Do yourself a favor and buy all three.
B000FA5TTW|4.0|The Lovely Bones is ultimately a story about letting go. Susie must let go of her life on earth, while her family must let go of the horror of her death, before any of them can really move on. How they go about it is the story. The murderer is simply the instigator. Without giving a spoiler, I thought Ray's portion of the ending was an unfortunate choice, and would have liked to have seen the murderer's portion of the ending go a little differently. But these didn't take away from my overall enjoyment of this fantastic and lovely story. Yes, I said lovely -- while there was tremendous horror addressed in the novel, love poured through it all like a glowing light.<br /><br />A note on Kindle formatting: There were very few (if any) errors or typos and the formatting was very readable.<br /><br />If this review gave you information that was helpful, please feel free to click the YES button below!
B002T9H2ME|4.0|Last month I watched [[ASIN:B002QW7AJY Pandorum]] about a couple of guys seemingly stranded in deep space that find themselves in a very confusing situation. And I suggested that Pandorum was reminiscent of the classic [[ASIN:B000H5U5EE Twilight Zone]] series. While Moon's story is completely different and unique, I would venture to say that I was again reminded of The Twilight Zone, and it is about a guy in space--on the Moon to be exact--that finds himself in a very confusing situation.<br /><br />Moon is a one man show...well, that's not exactly correct, but you'll have to see the movie to see what I mean. Sam Bell played by Sam Rockwell has a three year mission on the moon to oversee a mega corporation's mining operation that runs mostly on autopilot. While the autopilot of the mining operation keeps production flowing, and the base where Sam is housed has a mainframe with the AI of...well...of Kevin Spacey, Sam is needed to perform tasks that only a human could complete. But what if something unexpected happened to Sam?<br /><br />When I first heard about this movie I wrote it off as one of those films that was sure to be a psychological drama about a guy that go nuts from an extended solitary mission in space. Okay, Moon may ultimately have a tad bit of that, but by far Moon is a movie with much much more. Rockwell's acting is great. The movie never gets boring and is in fact quite suspenseful at times. Simply put: Moon is a great movie.<br /><br />And where was Sam Rockwell's nomination for Best Actor? I mean the guy completely carries Moon with a little voiceover help from Kevin Spacey.<br /><br />If you believe there's nothing up my sleeve, you've got to see Moon.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I was introduced to Serenity.  Afterwards, I was told that it was the conclusion to something called [[ASIN:B0000AQS0F Firefly]].  So after Serenity, then Firefly, I came back to Serenity.<br /><br />And it was better the second time.<br /><br />Serenity, the movie, is an entertaining sci-fi adventure.  The crew of the Firefly-class ship Serenity, captained by Captain Mal Reynolds, define themselves and their role in society when they rob an outer world bank.  But the Reavers, mad, cannibalistic space \\"pirates\\" (for lack of a better term), interrupt the robbery, and the crew continues to interact with them through the remainder of this tale.  Meanwhile, River Tam's (a girl made into an Alliance bioweapon) secrets continue to leak out.  She is a warrior, after all, and she has absorbed the memories of senior Alliance officials that give her insight into the mysterious planet, Miranda.<br /><br />But the search for River by the Alliance has gone into high gear.  An Operative sent after her is relentless, and merciless, as he tracks her down.<br /><br />Reavers, the Operative, River, and Serenity's crew come to meet at the nexus of Mr. Universe's... universe.  You can't stop the wave.<br /><br />Confused?  Firefly, the series, will show you the way.  But Serenity, the movie, is entertaining regardless.  Whether or not you've seen (or heard of) Firefly, Serenity will please your gray matter.

B002YIHO7I|4.0|After ten years the smooth sounds of Sade have finally returned; and it was long overdue. The band's vibe has not changed and Ms. Adu's voice is as strong and endearing as ever.  If you want to unwind and clear your mind of the day's events this album is ideal. This record lives up to the if it ain't broke don't fix it motto. Soldier of Love, the title song, is an immediate classic, the drum rhythms are infectious.  I am also drawn to In Another Time and Skin.   The album is not trying to be innovative or cutting edge, it is just pure grown folks music.
B000Y7U98W|4.0|SUNSHINE is an epic sci-fi thinker.  The effects and the science behind the mission to our nearest star are both interesting and reasonably plausible.  Of course, the movie takes theatrical liberties, but all in all the integrity of the film stays intact.  The movie is more about psychology than it is about anything else.  There are confusing moments, but for the most part the plot is solid and engaging.  The acting is very good.  The emotional investment comes at a much slower pace than movies like ARMAGEDON, but it still resonates.  Great film for thinkers!
B002TYZKIM|4.0|I am a huge Michael Jackson fan, so his death has had quite an effect on me.  It is as if a my childhood was officially buried with him.  I was torn about going to see This Is It in the theatre.  I felt as if it was too soon and all about money, not quite the tribute  Michael deserved.  After all with all the tours Michael Jackson went on he never released a substantial amount of behind the scenes footage.  I think he always liked to keep the illusion alive. Anyway I gave in to my own curiousity and I must say I was mixed with emotion.  It was fascinating to see how much of a perfectionist he was and what dedication went into his perfomances. At the same time it saddened me that this really was it.  I would never have the priviledge again, to see him in his element, on stage.  I hold onto those great memories I have of seeing him on the Bad Tour and with the Jackson Five in the seventies. This is It, is a must have for everyone that has been touched by Michael Jackson's music.  Even if you are not familiar with him, or were not fortunate enough to see him live, this is a dvd you should add to your collection.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I have been buying rock music for over fifty years and this is definitely amongst my top five albums of all time. Could even be the best.Very hard to believe it is a first album! The music seems to be a fusion of rock,folk,and bluegrass and has echoes of the early Strawbs album,[[ASIN:B00000B96Q From The Witchwood] I loved the light and shade of tone, the changes of rhythm and pace,and the passionate, spiritual lyrics with their encouragement to identify with what it is like to be fully human in a flawed, but God made world. I can give no greater compliment to Marcus Mumford other than to say that if John Donne and the other metaphysical poets were alive today, they would be writing lyrics like these.Marcus is clearly very mature and talented and has gathered a tight and gifted band around him whose performance is enhanced by a superb production.They deserve to have success \\"rain down\\" on them, yet when I saw them interviewed on YouTube,] they seemed to be refreshingly modest and content to let the music speak eloquently for them. And it really does! I can't wait to see a gig of theirs. Go out and buy this. You won't regret it. You might even \\"Sigh no More\\".
0312370849|5.0|This book will haunt you for a long time.  Writing is excellent and keeps you interested throughout.  Author does an excellent job of weaving together the past and the present, as well as presenting a bit of mystery.  Highly recommend.
B00005R87Q|5.0|This movie is top notch, love it, if there were more stars, I would have rated it to the max. The actors/actresses were all excellent. It holds your attentions through out the whole movie. It makes you feel you are there with them, you're just drawn in by the magnificent cars and the people themsevles. Someone taped the movie for me, I watched it so many times, I wore the CD out, so I bought the movie from Amazon and I'm still watching it. Excellent movie.
0891419195|5.0|I've read a lot of books about WWII, particularly the Pacific theater.  I deeply respect the fact that no one who hasn't experienced combat can really understand what it's like.  If you're a veteran, my comments don't apply. But for a civilian like me, this book comes the closest to giving an idea of how awful it was.  Just to think about what these men did, and what they endured to get it done, runs a shiver up my spine.  An incredible story.
B002NT3B52|1.0|This book is too 'dry' it has no good wording and I would give it a 0.1 if I could
B0039W1J0Q|5.0|Reviews are all over the place on this one so I clicked the purchase button with trepidation. I haven't listened to Peter Gabriel for probably ten years and wouldn't call myself a fan. My expectations were neutral, curious, maybe even non-existent.<br /><br />If you want the PG of 25 years ago, pay attention to the negative reviews and download \\"So\\". If you love the original versions of the songs he covers, download the originals. However, if you are open to a somewhat dark yet thought provoking re-working of other artist's work, then you should find this a very pleasant experience.
B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|I was introduced to the works of Director, Hayao Miyazaki less than a decade ago. At first glance, his work may seem \\"different\\". My first experience with Miyazaki's work came with the best animated film of 2002, \\"Spirited Away\\". I have to admit, this is not the best film to use as a doorway into the world of Ghibli, as \\"Spirited Away\\" rides that \\"different\\" line a lot harder than most of his work. However, after my next experience, \\"My Neighbor Totoro\\", I was completely hooked. These are films that, when watched with unclouded vision, will open up your movie world to a whole other arena you never imagined possible. I am more calm and relaxed when I watch a Miyazaki film, than when I watch any other Director's work. There is a serenity present in the worlds he creates that cannot be found anywhere else.   \\"Ponyo\\" is no exception, and in fact may be the piece that best represents that feeling I have when watching a Miyazaki film. The colors are vibrant, and the animation pristine. There is incredible value given to the art of traditional hand-drawn animation. It begs the question to enter our minds as to why that form of art has been, for the most part, abandoned. The music, (from composer Joe Hisaishi) is transcending. Mr. Hisaishi is to Hayao Miyazaki what John Williams is to Steven Spielberg. The marriage of their work is meant to be.  I cherish the innocence of the story. The characters, while experiencing extraordinary things, remain emotionally deep, and memorable. The scenery is as inviting as ever. You feel at times, as if you have become a permanent part of what you are viewing. It leaves the realm of animated film, and becomes something real, if only inside of you.  This is Miyazaki at his absolute best. If you have not been introduced to the works of this amazing Director, this is a fantastic entry point, and should be taken with no questions asked. In the opinion of this reviewer, this was the best film of 2009.
B002UJIY7A|3.0|I have to say that watching the previews for A Perfect Getaway prior to it is release in theaters, I decided it was a movie I wanted to see. However, after the movie came and went from the big screen I thought otherwise. Now that A Perfect Getaway is on DVD, I gave it another try and was pleasantly surprised. This is an enjoyable movie for those who appreciate the action and suspense genre. As the previews advertised, three couples on vacation in Hawaii realize that maybe, one couple is not what they seem. Mila Jojovich and Steve Zahn both play against their types. Timothy Olyphant (Hitman), and Kiele Sanchez (Lost), are excellent supporting actors. The story moves quickly, allows the viewer to identify immediately with the main characters. Within the first minutes, we are also introduced to three different couples that all could be the killers. A good movie to watch on a Friday night, with your wife or girlfriend and a bowl of popcorn.
B001GM28HO|5.0|Recommended. I've received my product on time, and it's an amazing album! This album is result of Lady Gaga's hard work. Loved its beats and rhythms.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|I have one word to describe this movie \\"masterpiece\\".  If you are a mafia movie collector this is the movie
B002BW7A58|1.0|I cannot even explain my disappointment with this CD. I preordered it because Lil Wayne has always been so great at everything he has done. If I could return this CD I would. I think he is trying to prove that he is better at more than just rapping, but unfortunately it proved the opposite point. What is this CD even classified as? It sounds like it could be on a pop radio station... although I have not heard any of these songs on any radio station yet. Probably because all of the songs suck really badly. The only song that I can stand is the one with Eminem and even then, I skip through all of Lil Wayne's part. I will not be listening to this CD very often. It makes me want to cry. I hope he goes back to what he is amazing at with his next CD. I will NOT be preording it next time.
B000P12LWY|2.0|As a serious Tudor buff this series was on a whole disappointing - a soap opera set in Tudor England starring Henry the VIII.  The costumes, the hairstyles and even the speech patterns all wrong! Forget about historical fact. Tudor history has so much rich political and religious intrigue it could keep any scriptwriter in material for years why the writers felt they had to fictionalize I do not know.    The cast is ok, although Henry the VIII never ages, and some of the cast choices left me scratching my head, Sam Neill as Cardinal Wolsey just was not convincing.      I would recommend this for anyone who likes costume dramas without any expectations.  This is not historical fact, but that is why they call it Showtime.
0061922315|5.0|This is a wonderful book! A must read!! Emotionally charged...culturally interesting...full of incredible family dynamics...I could not put it down! Gowda takes us on a journey to a place and situation so different from life in America, while also bringing us back to a world so familiar. The juxtaposition of India's poverty and California living is dramatic. The story gets you thinking, questioning and wondering as one girl's story explores issues of adoption, differing traditions and perspectives, poverty and wealth, family connections and isolation, happiness and anger. This is a perfect novel for a book club, `cause when it is done, you want to talk about it!! And there are some wonderful characters!!!  Hats off to this first-time author! I cannot wait for her next book!!!
B0021L9ME6|4.0|I enjoyed this movie very much. She is a good actress in this sort of movie. It is a movie about a different kind of superhero which I like. (I'm an old comic book fan) Halle Berry has said ,as I understand it, that she won't make more because of the overly tight costume. While I can't really blame her for that, I think it's a shame!
B0002YCVXI|5.0|I first heard Mr. Morricone's theme from the movie \\"The Mission\\", was awe-struck by it.  Such beautiful music!  Searched for the entire movie music and found this one which showed Yo-Yo Ma's super accompaniment to all of Mr. Morricone's selections. This will be treasured!
1591396190|5.0|A must read strategy book for entrepreneurs and practitioners, The Blue Ocean Strategy has stood the test of time. This breakthrough work provides insights on how to take advantage of \\"white spaces\\" in the marketplace and compete against non-competition.  The primary argument by Chan and Mauborgne is that organizations should focus on making markets instead of competing within them.     In a classic example, the authors reference Cirque du Soleil, who created a high-end market space in the circus business, creating a new brand of entertainment, capturing market share and charging a price premium of more than 10 times that of a traditional circus. In an age when markets can be transformed overnight, Blue Ocean provides a framework for focusing on the most productive and profitable market segments.
B0036EH3TS|3.0|If you want to see a movie with loud action, awesome special effects and pure destruction (even though it's content is absurd) this is the movie for you. I might warn you, there are some real cheesy scenes that might make your eyes bleed.<br /><br />I am no astronaut, nor do I work for NASA or even worse ever read a book about space, and yet I found load of things  when I saw this in the movies 12 years ago that it was impossible for it to happen, but yet since it is for entertainment purposes I tried not to care much for it. The asteroid shower being all of a sudden unexpected in the beginning of the film can be an insult to moviegoers IQ and the fact that you have to drill in a huge asteroid -supposedly the size of Texas- a warhead in order to destroy `the bitch' might be as well too fiction, but in the long run it is a typical blockbuster film and not a documentary from the Discovery Channel.<br /><br />Filled with a fun cast and special effects that are still fresh `til this date, Armageddon might be the movie you need to watch whenever you want to see a movie that contains any of the following items from my first sentence. The writers of the movie are the ones to blame for the illogical sequences mention (and those are just a few) but I found the directing by Michael Bay quite impressive.
B00008OE4W|4.0|I bought this for my husband's birthday.  We liked it...it was made way back when computers were pretty new, so it's not up-to-date as far as computer technology is concerned.  But it's a good movie, lots of action (in my opinion...I tend to get really involved in movies), and not too predictable.
B000URDE2Y|5.0|This Album represents a clearly \\"inspired\\" and defining moment in Robin's career. As a guitarist myself, this Album has provided me with an inspiration that has lasted for more than 30 years. For Trower fans this particular album maintains an honorary spot on their rack. For those who are checking out Trower for the first time, you have come to the right place. While taking in what is surely some of the most unique and interesting blues based riffery in the history of Rock, take note of the rich, throaty, warmest of guitar \\"tones\\" ever to grace a music speaker. A \\"tone\\" that has continued and will continue to inspire guitarists to search for that elusive pearl for years to come.
0307588335|5.0|First of all, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and gave it five stars. It is a page turning narrative and is well within the grasp of the layman. I have read other reviews of this book and I certainly am not at all in agreement with the main criticisms which contend that this book is an exercise in egocentrism. The author goes into great lengths to extoll the brilliance and research abilities of those above him, and puts them in the limelight even more than himself. One might say he merely profited on the advice of those whose forte was the long view. The author also goes into detail to bring out the personal shortcomings of those at the very top of the pinnicle (Fuld et.al.) who ultimately brought the firm down, mainly the stubborn refusal to listen to those who really had their ear to the ground. I most heartily recommend this book to those who want a birds eye view of the credit debacle as it slowly unfolded. It should also be noted that other books on the subject also ascribe the main cause of the crash to the same set of circumstances, despite some of the objections of the politically correct reviewers, to whit: giving irresponsible loans to the poor and the lower segments of our economy(the trailer park trash).

B0036EH40Q|5.0|I don't know whether this is the \\"director's cut\\" or not - all I know is that is was one of the best westerns I've ever seen and the performances by everyone were superb, especially Val Kilmer!
B001M4YZ90|5.0|I liked Lock, Stock and Snatch, but I loved RocknRolla.  It was stylish, clever, and extremely funny.  In many ways, it was a typical gangster movie, with a few thefts, a few shoot outs, and a few double crosses. However, it was the relationships between the characters, as well as the unexpected surprises, that made the story.  For example, when Archie, (Mark Strong)the top enforcer for criminal boss Lenny Cole (Tom Wilkinson), was instructing his underlings in the art of the backhanded slap, he advised them that if they could perfect the slap, \\"strong violence\\" wasn't necessary; but if their target didn't talk after being slapped, they could cut him or pay him, \\"but keep the reciepts because this isn't the mafia.\\"  And speaking of the mafia, remember how the gang reacted when they found out that Tony Soprano was getting therapy for anxiety attacks and how they reacted when they found out one of the family was gay?  Well, suffice it to say, these British gangsters are infinitely more sophisticated and much funnier.  The psychoanalytic ramblings of Cole's estranged stepson, Johnny Quidd (Toby Kebel) were hysterical, as were the reactions of various gangsters to the homosexuality of a gang member.  However, there were many parts of this movie that were just laugh out loud funny -- in part because the moments were so unexpected.  There are two particularly funny scenes toward the end:  (1) a chase scene that ends due to a very unexpected twist that leaves Mr. One-Two (Gerard Butler), the small time gangster being chased, laughing at his good fortune; and (2) a scene where Archie goes to round up One-Two and finds him in such a ludicrously compromised position that he ends up laughing.    The cast was really excellent. I particularly enjoyed Tom Wilkinson, Mark Strong, Gerard Butler, and Toby Kebel.  Although I really love Jeremy Piven, and he's good here, because the other characters were so well developed and so well portroyed, Piven's character simply faded into thebackground.    The plot had some twists, but the unexpected developments really made the movie.  Some of the reviews here complained that the movie was hard to follow, but I didn't think so.  However, I would not recommend trying to watch this movie while doing laundry or paying bills.  The action is rapid fire and there are a lot of characters, os you will miss too much if you are distracted.      The end of the movie leaves some questions unanswered and promises a sequel. I hope Guy Ritchie delivers because a sequel because I would dearly love to know how Archie got the painting and why it is he comes to be where he is at the end.  And if you watch the movie, you'll want to know too.
B00389ZUAU|4.0|Yeah!  It is about time! Last nights episode was awesome! I am so glad Morgan knows about Chuck. Now if they could just put Chuck and Sarah back together and ditch superman, I will be in heaven! Good job writers now keep it up!
1423101472|5.0|I will admit that I only became aware and interested in this series when the ads for The Lightning Thief movie came out. I read the books and I thoroughly enjoyed them all, including the Last Olympian. It was a fitting end to a great series.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|The product arrived on time and in very good condition. I am very satisfied with my purchase.
B002A9IZ9C|3.0|This product provides good value for the money. It performs well and seems to be well made. It is very adjustable in flash angles and power and operataing function. The front subflash is very strong and a defuser (frosted cellophane tape) helps reduce its overpowering effect when using the flash in bounce mode. It is still a great deal. This is comparable to more expensive flashes. Check manufacturers site for more info and instructions. The new optional external power pack is pricey, see MRP , but spare standard battery packs are a good option.    I am not sure where the packaging issue developed, but my flash was shipped without warranty card or instructions. I contacted Adorama customer service dept by phone, who said product did not include instructions, but they woud get me a warranty card. People who subsequently received the same product from Adorama recieved instructions, printed and CD, as shown in You Tube video on the product. I have again had to contact, by email to customer service, Adorama about the irregularities and lack of promised warrranty card. They promise a warranty card will be forthcoming. I suspect my product was a returned item, as the stand was not in the original packing position and missing both operating instructions. A pdf file of instructions is available from the manufacturer website.
B002WY65VU|1.0|I know zombie movies are just supposed to be harmless fun that you suspend disbelief somewhat to enjoy, but how did these girls manage to operate carnival rides while riding them? In a zombie Apocalypse? And why is the electricity still on everywhere? *yawn* Woody Harrelson is hard to dislike in anything he's in, and this is no exception, but what is with Jesse Eisenberg? He is like the poor-man's Michael Cera. Except way more annoying and unlikable. Go see a zombie movie worth seeing, like the original \\"[[ASIN:B0001611DI Dawn of the Dead (Divimax Edition)]]\\" or the not strictly zombie pic \\"[[ASIN:B00005JMA8 28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)]].\\" Zombieland: What a load of junk, and not even any fun when considered as parody. It even manages to make Bill Murray seem boring and unfunny. Glad I saw it on demand for five bucks instead of paying for it permanently. To wrap up: Just plain awful.
B002KHMZVI|5.0|It seems most perspectives are learned based on personal experiences or the internalized experiences of others.    The near universal narration of this book makes it accessible: a child at play, making sense of an patently imperfect and covertly hostile world.    The point of view character, Scout, is a young girl, so young that behaving according to gender is something she has not yet mastered.    Similarly, the concepts of poverty, racism, sexuality, and violence are unclear to her.    As the story unfolds, through her eyes the reader gains (or revisits) these perspectives in a place and time that is likely at least a little different from our own - and thus the work is as insightful now as it was when it was written.
B000HDZKGY|5.0|I remember buying this on cassette tape when it was first released. I grew up listening to Billy, the MTV generation. The real MTV, not this reality TV garbage that's on these days. Although it's the softer side of Billy, \\"Prodigal Blues\\" is one of my favorite songs of all time. I remember how cool the music video was too. Riding his hog, blind folded! Then sliding sideways to a stop at the edge of a cliff. Billy Idol has always been the poster boy of what cool really is. I wish that song was on his greatest hits.
1595478728|5.0|Not so much a step-by-step handbook, more of a progressive recounting of the intellectual road to Truth, G. K. Chestertons 'Orthodoxy' is a classic for those who love to hear the Truth in fleshed out terms. In short, I simply loved it and could see from the first few pages why this work is a classic must read.<br /><br />Much like C. S. Lewis (of whom I greatly admire), Chesterton is a wordsmith painting pictures, giving examples, drawing out the facts in real life form.<br /><br />From 'The Suicide of Thought\\"...<br />It is idle to talk always of the alternative of reason and faith. Reason is itself a matter of faith. It is an act of faith to assert that our thoughts have any relation to reality at all.<br /><br />From \\"The Flag of the World\\"...<br />An imbecile habit has arisen in modern controversy of saying that such and such a creed can be held in one age but cannot be held in another. Some dogma, we are told, was credible in the twelfth century, but is not credible in the twentieth. You might as well say that a certain philosophy can be believed on Mondays, but cannot be believed on Tuesdays. You might as well say of a view of the cosmos that it was suitable to half-past three, but not suitable to half-past four. What a man can believe depends upon his philosophy, not upon the clock or the century.<br /><br />From \\"The Paradoxes of Christianity\\"...<br />This is the thrilling romance of Orthodoxy. People have fallen into a foolish habit of speaking of orthodoxy as something heavy, humdrum, and safe. There never was anything so perilous or so exciting as orthodoxy. It was sanity: and to be sane is more dramatic than to be mad.<br /><br />I must limit the sections of this book that were my favorite otherwise I would include the entire book.<br /><br />What a reasoning thinker Chesterton was? What was my take this great book? In a sentence I would have to say, his point that the dreamer who looks at the paradoxes in life and accepts them attributing all as gifts of God is far greater than the intellectual who would have this grand creation categorized, sequenced and number before accepting the Truth.<br /><br />This is one book every christian should read. No excuse not to get this one read as you can read it free from the Cyber Library of Leadership U. Recommended highly as I continue to re-read many sections.is grand creation categorized, sequenced and number before accepting the Truth.    This is one book every christian should read.

B001DHXT6G|4.0|Okay, to be fair I didn't see Star Trek the first time around since I was too young.  However I got hooked on reruns in the 70's.  I have been holding off purchasing and finally decided to just do it.  Having read most of the reviews I have to agree that the packaging is... interesting to say the least.  It personally doesn't upset me as much as some (I think it's kinda cool) but I do wish the discs were labled with larger writing/episodes.  The insert cards are fine, but you can't line them up with each disc since it is in a \\"clear box\\" package.  If I wasn't so taken with the outer package then the inner one would probably upset me more.    Now, as for the content - this is where I see the most disagreement. For the most part I feel they did a very good job of revitalizing the colors and music and I do feel that the effects they added would have been approved by Roddenberry... it's not over the top and done just because they could do it (aka Star Wars/Lucas).  I would have been happy with the unretouched version or this one - I bought this one because I could get all three seasons together, bonus material, and it was cheaper... I think it helps that I am second gen Star Trek so I don't feel betrayed by the upgrades.  The only thing I wish they had done has nothing to do with the special effects - it's the subtitles.  THERE ARE NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES - why?  I often have the subtitles on to keep the volume down or for friends/family that are hard of hearing... I can live with it, but it would be nice if they put on subtitles for future releases.    Very glad I finally bought this set.  It's been wonderful seeing the shows again - the concepts and stories are great (race, color, creed, gender, age - non issues in Roddenberry's future) and I enjoy introducing the show to the third and fourth gen!
B0032KNA4I|5.0|Great movie, special effects, storyline was ok, and picture and sound on Bluray is fantastic!  However, in the past 10 years, Hollywood has wised up and normally puts sufficient subtitles and even other language sound tracks on DVDs & now Blurays.  But then every once in a while they release a blockbuster like this one with only English & French subtitles, or even worse, no subtitles.  Hello ??!!??Practically all of the western hemispher speaks spanish. Why is there no spanish??!!?? French is spoken only in Montreal, France, and Haiti.  DVDs and Blurays have plenty of space for subtitles, so why isn't one of the largest spoken languages here ? (one can say the same for chinese too).    Wake up Hollywood!!
B000RZIGVS|4.0|In case you haven't seen it before in other reviews - the box edition packaging is AWFUL!  I ordered it knowing full well from the reviews that it was crap because it was definately cheaper to purchase as a whole and I wanted the bonus disk.  Great series - certainly worth the money... and with the money I saved buying the whole set I'm going out to buy something alittle more durable to put the disks in.  To me it is worth it to buy covers and have the complete series with bonus disk.  ENJOY!
0452282152|5.0|I found this novel by chance and was enchanted. The author not only captures a world so far removed from our own as to nearly be science fiction..but she paints it with broad strokes and dark shadows.     Lovely Griet is a contradiction of traits. Proud yet humble, sly yet innocent. She stumbles throughout her teen years trying always to find and keep her place. She knows her responsibilities and the expectations placed upon her as daughter, woman and household maid. She errs often and pays a heavy price for her mistakes. Vermeer seemed to me,  an unsympathetic milquetoast of a character willing to let the women around him bear his burdens as he escapes into his art, painting a world he probably wished he himself inhabited. The author's words are beautiful, her style is much like the painting itself, lit from within.  My only complaint was that the book was much too short.  I was left wanting more.
0609610570|3.0|A few years ago, the reading club at my company proposed this book. Immediately I yelled \\"Boring!\\" When asked why, I said, \\"Execution is what we do every day. I question that this will stretch us.\\" Now I finally have read the book, and stand by my initial comment.<br /><br />There is some value here, to be clear. Some interesting anecdotes. Some fascinating preening by Bossidy, who clearly sees himself, Jack Welch, and one or two others as smarter than anyone else in the corporate world. And some healthy focus on the how of moving from strategy to action, and on the importance of developing leaders.<br /><br />But the book's fundamental premise, that companies fail (unless run by him, Jack or a few friends) because they don't execute, only stands because the authors subordinate strategy to execution. In other words, execution means strategy, plus moving from strategy to action. Well, I guess. I just don't see much value in that definition.<br /><br />Let's keep the issues separate. Strategy matters. If you agree with that, then read Jim Collins and a host of others to figure out what matters most. How strategy is built matters. If you agree with that, this book has some useful ideas, but nothing I haven't seen in several companies. And moving strategy into action to achieve results matter. Again, this book has useful ideas, but nothing that rocks my world.<br /><br />Bottom line, the book over reaches. Worth a quick scan. Definitely some good ideas. But it reads like a vanity piece. I found no intellectual rigor here, no \\"ah ha!\\" insights, no frameworks I could add to my management toolkit.<br /><br />Net, as I suspected years ago: Boring!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I love this series.  It is a must have for anyone who enjoys learning about animals and nature.
B0034GK7DM|5.0|YEP! It is!<br /><br /> This guy reminds me of the time way way back when I first heard George Strait when I was a kid. I got all crazy excited hearing Easton's first single .....one time! That's all it took was one listen for me to say ...WOW...this guy sounds awesome.<br /><br /> Now after hearing all of his debut cd I am MORE than impressed. I grew up on Merle Haggard, Waylon Jennings, Willie, Cash, etc. and this guy is bringing country BACK!!!!<br /><br /> I, like others, are disgusted by the bubblegum pop crap \\"country\\" that doesn't belong even being called country nowadays. The radio is repulsive in my mind so I don't really listen to it. I usually come to Amazon and look up artists I like and discover other artists like Easton by accident.<br /><br /> My 4 favorite artists are (no particular order) Jamey Johnson (amazing amazing amazing 1,000,000% country) , Gary Allan (most underrated COUNTRY artist from day 1) , George Strait (the KING), and now Easton Corbin!<br /><br /> Those artists ARE country!<br /><br />I hope Easton has a career that people only dream of and he has many many albums to come. I hope he doesn't fall off the map like Blaine Larsen (a great young kid with an amazing country voice). I'm also praying he doesn't fall into the wrong hands of Nashville like Kenny Chesney did. Listen to Kenny's first 2 or 3 cds, then listen to his newer work! He went downhill faster than a snowball in hell!<br /><br /> I would believe the great country boys of the past that have passed on are 2 steppin in the grave knowing this dude is rockin some real country tunes. Hope we can let Nashville (crapville, whatever u wanna call em) know that this is what we want pumped out of there, NOT anymore Taylor Puking Swift and the like!<br /><br /> You want new country? Buy this album, both Jamey Johnsons, and all of Gary Allans and you are good to go!<br /><br />NOW THIS IS COUNTRY!
B0035KTIOQ|5.0|When 'Communique' was being recorded, Dire Straits' first, self-titled album was just becoming noticed world-wide. Instead of recording in London in February, on a tight budget, as they had with their first album, Dire Straits found themselves in the Bahamas in December with a different production team. The overall 'sound', if compared to their first release, is a bit more \\"laid-back\\". Perhaps, as some have suggested, due to the tropical locale of their second recording.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it contains, to some of us Dire Straits/Mark Knopfler fans, some of the most sublimely 'smooth' guitar work Mark Knopfler's ever done. Just listen, with eyes closed, to the first three songs. Effortless and graceful guitarwork interlaced with strong, tight rhythmic backing. This was still the original four piece group with just a touch of extras (listen for the organ in Where Do You Think You're Going?, and the outdoor sounds of crickets and the gentle surf in Follow Me Home).<br /><br />I just finished listening to my new Warner Brothers 180 gram 'audiophile' LP recording for the second time since picking it up three days ago. I'll suggest one point of comparison for those who wish to compare CD versus LP (I have a 'SBM' [Super Bit Mapping] re-mastered Vertigo/ Mercury import CD to compare to the new vinyl record). When you get to the last cut on the disc -'Follow Me Home'-  listen to the sounds of the crickets and then the surf. If you listen to the CD first, it will sound very natural as the 'SBM' re-master is very resolute and refined as CDs go. If you follow that with the vinyl record, you'll be looking for the crickets in your room, and the surf sounds will be soooo \\"wet\\" sounding compared to the CD. The \\"hiss\\" of the flowing water on the wet sand particles is incredibly life-like! Real life sounds that most all of us have heard and know what they REALLY sound like to us. The record, which is ANALOG, is reproduced completely as ANALOG all the way from the original ANALOG tapes from December 1978!<br /><br />Hooray to those at Warner Brothers who are responsible for bringing us this wonderful series of Dire Straits' first four albums on beautifully produced 180 gram audiophile-quality vinyl discs!<br /><br />It's SO EASY to give this recording FIVE STARS!!!!! My highest recommendation!!!!!OG tapes from December 1978!<br /><br />Hooray to those at Warner Brothers who are responsible for bringing us this wonderful series of Dire Straits' first four albums on beautifully produced 180 gram audiophile-quality vinyl discs!<br /><br />It's SO EASY to give this recording FIVE STARS!!!!!

B002CMLIJ6|1.0|I wish I could rate this a negative percent, but the 2009 summer movie season started out with such a magnificent hastily polished turd.    The story is completely inane and full of holes and gaps of logic, which would be okay if the characterization or action pieces were interesting or entertaining but those are extremely poor. The special effects look like cardboard cut outs flying around digital explosions. Most of the time CGI is used when a practical effect would have been wholly more effective, especially with Logan's claws.    As a comic book fan, they totally screw up that aspect too. Logan stands around disapprovingly when he is with his Weapons Plus team and does nothing. He has no character arc and they felt they had to give EVERYTHING he wore or did have an origin. We don't need Ma and Pa Kent to take him in and give him a leather jacket of their dead son; maybe he just likes leather jackets.  This is the kinda movie you get when a hack film maker that hates comic books as a medium and surely doesn't understand them or special effects.   Easily one of the worst movies ever.

1573226521|2.0|Not only is this book poorly written with overly simplistic characters and an amazingly stupid ending, it's also completely implausible.     Suspending disbelief is one thing, but this takes it too far. We're supposed to buy that a bunch of 20-somethings are incredibly happy--in a glassy-eyed, cultish sort of way-- to stay on an island for years, accept assigned manual labor every day, live on fish and have no access to even the most basic supplies such as a pair of glasses or a tampon.     The plot never seems to build logically, instead it careens along in a directionless way until the last 50 pages when, out of the clear blue sky, all hell breaks loose. I literally put the book down and said, \\"What?\\" outloud.     Sadly, the first half of this novel shows glimmers of talent and style which is why I gave it two stars instead of one. But then it seems like Gardland wrote himself into a corner, and rather than fix the problem, he opted to explode the whole room.

B001F0VHEM|5.0|Although Ive seen Pink on the Ellen Degeneres show, I was not really a fan..had none of her CDs and considered her a performer for the younger crowd only. I was completely entranced by her performance at the Grammys this year and sought out the song she sang while doing her acrobatics. It was hauntingly beautiful. I purchased this CD for that song and the CD has become my favorite go to disc in my car. The uptempo pieces are as enjoyable as the ballads. I understand that this CD came from her heartbreak and it is truly an emotional collection. This woman has a fabulous voice. I am a new \\"fan.\\"

I just want to go to the beach and listen to this cd over and over again. Just a breath talking cd this is.I think the best tracks are Glitter. Freeze Broken On. Melancholy Hill, To Binge,, Man that song Is a Trip to Paradise !!! I  sure people are going to compain about this cd because it's a lot more relaxing and softer then what we might use to be. The hardest song on here is Stylo, Love the video by the way, if you haven't seen it. Bruce --- does a nice job !! So that will be it, Just kick back drink a couple of cold ones and just stare out to the SuN!!!!
B0013XW2F4|5.0|I regard my Kindle as a cool sort of entertainment tool I can lug about with me on planes and to the dentist.  In order for it to fulfill it's function, it needs to have cool sort of entertainment reading on it and that is exactly what this book is.  I have read everything there is to read about Sherlock Holmes so there is nothing new for me in the collection but it is incredibly comforting to lose myself in this book on my Kindle when faced with an imminent root canal or a very long boarding queue at the airport.  Conan Doyle is reliable, so is Sherlock Holmes - I know I won't  be disappointed and that's damn rare noadays.
0446569895|5.0|there are 7 musicians in history i would consider a genius.mozart,beethoven,bob dylan,paul mc cartney,john lennon,jimi hendrix and YES ozzy osbourne.                     he overcame alcoholism to create great music like mozart.he overcame physical problems as did beethoven...etc.this guy survived things that have killed countless other musicians well before thier time.                    the story covers everything from him being a poverty stricken child to right up until now.ozzy does have adhd.so the stories he tells arent gradual.they are straight to the point.the stories always start\\"i'd smoked.....or i was smashed from drinking\\"...insert story.then he pops in a punchline.i get manic sometimes which makes my concentration crap but his style of writing worked right in with that.i read the book in under  a week.it was a real page turner!i couldnt seem to put it down very much.                     he addresses all the stuff you've heard about and so much more.plus,he's really funny.more like hilarious!so i say it is no \\"a clockwork orange\\" or \\"1984\\" but it is DEFINATELY worth reading.the only bio ive ever read i liked more than this one was the first few books of the new testament.
0385504225|5.0|I'm only 1/5 of the way through this book, yet I can hardly put it down and have to recommend it. If I could only read this 1/5 of it, it would have been worth the price of the book alone! That tells you something. I'm upset that I started this book on Sunday evening, therefore can only read snippets of it through the work week rather than one thoroughly long, enjoyable reading period over the weekend! I had my doubts about this book, I tend to only read non-ficion these days (and I've also read The Da Vinci Code which I absolutely loved), and yet Dan Brown has proven himself once again. To those naysayers, obviously this book is going to be different from The Da Vinci Code! He can't write the same book!     *Update*  I finished the book! Loved it! Almost wanted to miss a day of work just so I could finish it! Who cares if he isn't Charles Dickens or Leo Tolstoy- Dan Brown inspires and captures your heart and imagination! It's the content that matters, not the form! I recommend this to everyone! :)
B002S0OBN2|3.0|The long awaited sequel to Andrew Lloyd Webber's the Phantom of the Opera has arrived in CD format with the two CD Love Never Dies. For hardcore Phantom Phans, you will enjoy flashback musical moments from Phantom #1 such as 'twisted every way' (which is part of the track Before the Performance) as well as 'little lotte' (part of Ah, Christine).<br /><br />Andrew Lloyd Webber claims that we should judge this as a stand-alone show. Alas, one cannot. Where the Phantom of the Opera held its ground as a groundbreaking show with rich melodies, Love Never Dies is a combination of memories of Aspects of Love, Evita, The Beautiful Game, and Phantom. Well versed in those productions, this seems like those shows all put into one. You can hear certain tracks and think 'oh this reminds of me of sunset boulevard' The one thing missing from this show.. the magic..  the suspense.. the feeling of 'aww this is beautiful' when you hear a number.<br /><br />This CD features some very strong tracks such as \\"Till I hear you sing again\\" and \\"Love Never Dies\\" .. but aside from a few strong pieces, the rest is nothing but a syrupy floor mess in the sound of a cheesy American musical. It's not bad, it's just not great. The strong tracks help make up for it, but that's all. I gave it a 3 out of 5 because it could have been more, but alas, they failed on that. I don't compare this to Phantom... i compare it to every other show I have ever seen or heard, .. and think, 'yeah its ok, nothing brilliant'<br /><br />I will not reveal the one cheesy rock piece that is a crap-replacement for 'The Phantom of the Opera' song.. It often amazes me that ALW (webber) tries hard to appease everyone. He needs to just stick to what he knows is true. Fact is, he had a built-in audience with Phantom fans. These people would go see the show for sure, no question..  but instead, he decided to pander to a new demographic..  as a result, his Phantom Phans will tear this to shreds, which isn't the wisest marketing strategy for him to pursue.<br /><br />A missed opportunity - no doubt. A for effort - C for execution.  Again, it' not bad, it's just not great. The quality of the recording is great.. as are the voices.sue.     A missed opportunity - no doubt. A for effort - C for execution.  Again, it' not bad, it's just not great. The quality of the recording is great.. as are the voices.

0767020308|5.0|Wonderful! I've read the book a thousand years ago but the movie is much more interesting...There's another version with Gwinnet Paltrow, but I can say this version is the best ever. For those who enjoy romantic movies, Jane Austen's work fullfil inner feelings.
B002S0OBN2|5.0|I saw the first ever public performance of the show (lucky me, but not for others, the first one was canceled, mine turned out to be THE first one)How to start addressing this show...with tact:<br /><br />Let me start by saying that the story is not as strong as the original, none of the Gothic gore implied by The Phantom, this is a more human one. The phantom is not below anymore, but towers above, in a penthouse overlooking Coney Island. He can now 'walk amongst man' another freak in a permanent freak show. Hence, the phantom we meet here is less mysterious, his torment more complex, not just obsession, but vulnerability. The story falters at times, I must admit it, yet the show is beautifully done and manages to move you and close the chapter.<br /><br />The music<br /><br />1. Prologue<br />2. The Coney Island Waltz<br />3. That's the place that you ruined, you fool!<br /><br />---A terrible opening for a show, akin to the dreadful opening to the woman in white (a show that should not have existed and has been mercifully musically remade into Love never dies). The saving grace is the Waltz and its marvelous projections (on the show) a lovely piece, truly pure Webber. That's the place you ruined, fool and prologue could go amiss and no one will notice.<br /><br />4. Heaven By The Sea<br />---- nice song, a touch out of place with the darker more romantic music, but attempting to capture the banality and lightheartedness of the time and the society in NY at the time. It serves its purpose, the core musical theme being lifted mainly from a repetitive melodic phrase used to death in woman in white, still, nice.<br /><br />5. Only For Him / Only For You<br />-----A nice song with a less forthcoming orchestration, lovely melodic tilt, intended to show Meg's love for the Phantom. It appears Webber tried to make a clear distinction between the deep love the phantom has for Christine with the 'cheap' and brassy tolerance he shows Meg, one (Christine's) is for sustenance, the other (Meg) is for survival. I like this song, maybe the distinction marked by the styles is rather too wide, making it two dimensional and one sided (leaning towards Christine)It achieves that.<br /><br />6. The Aerie<br />----A lovely, haunting, beautiful instrumental, right from the bowels of the Phantom of the opera. Thick, serene, moving<br /><br />7. Til I Hear You Sing<br />---Now we are talking, this is a magnificent song, a true descendant from the original Phantom. A pure display of the best Lloyd Webber can produce. Ramin is absolutely brilliant in it, This song makes the whole show worth it, really.<br /><br />8. Giry Confronts The Phantom / 'Til I Hear You Sing<br />---A nice excuse for listening to Ramin again. Giry's bit is typical of the sung through melodic style in Phantom. Very well done by Giry.<br /><br />9. Christine Disembarks<br />---mostly spoken, snippets of melodies in the background, mainly themes that will develop later<br /><br />10. Arrival Of The Trio / Are You Ready To Begin?<br />I don't care for the three new characters..the Phantom's henchman. Their a-melodic and tense musical themes grind me, not good voices, neither great lyrics, they just add to the oddness that is the phantom, but are never developed enough to matter or to add any depth to the phantom, They are cliches that fill in space. I wish a judge would give Webber a court restraining order so he cannot get near electric guitars, he seems to think that by using them he is 'edgy', wrong! Lovely melodic bit at the end for Gustav, again, lots from woman in white.<br /><br />11. What A Dreadful Town!...<br />---I like this song. A lovely string punctuation quite different from Webber's style. Mature, efficient.<br /><br />12. Look With Your Heart<br />---Beautiful waltz, sweet, with surprising melodic changes that slide into one another. Fresh and tender.<br /><br />13. Beneath A Moonless Sky<br />--This is the heavy bit! the first few notes and chords are straight fromthe beginning of the song 'the phantom of the opera', as the phantom enters Christine's room and sees her for the first time in ten years. Although the refrain in this song will remind you of the cell block tango from Chicago (I mean it)it is a powerful, beautiful ballad (kind of a tango as well) here we get the whole story of what happened in the last ten years, a bit of a rush, but such a powerful song, the phantom has entered the room...really a triumph<br /><br />14. Once Upon Another Time<br />---Less of a song than above, but still sweet and lovely with a great melodic surge, dense with meaning and very much an aria in the opera style.<br /><br />15. \\"Mother Please, I'm Scared!\\"<br />--Incidental stuff, the phantom meets Gustav...we get the electric guitar...bearable...it works, just enough, the right balance.<br />16. Dear Old Friend<br />---Great song a la notes in Phantom. cleverly worded, with touches of the original show and to great effect. It does have the same rhythmic style as Prima Donna , and the scene calls for it, as Meg is a Prima Donna in her work at Coney and Christine is a Prima Donna in her own right, with the trick from 'notes' of shifting between conversations.<br />17. Beautiful<br />---Haunting, sweet melody for Gustav.<br />18. The Beauty Underneath<br />---Loved by some, hated by almost every single soul that saw the show when I saw it. Too much guitar, too far off the musical style for the show, too modern. Honestly, I hated at the moment. One can imagine Elton John playing a set with AC/DC...it has its moments and many will like it...I found it a low point in the show, uncomfortable.<br />19. The Phantom Confronts Christine<br />---Nice, a mix of themes previously heard<br /><br />Disc 2<br /><br />1. Entr'acte<br />---Just that, but I love it.<br />2. Why Does She Love Me?<br />--A brooding song, quite different from the Webber stock, although in the same vein as his musical foundation for Sunset. Really nice and very well performed.<br />3. Devil Take The Hindmost<br />---Brilliant, brilliant...all I can say is 'Javert and Valjean's dialogue at Fantine's deathbed'...as powerful and as sublime.<br />4. Heaven By The Sea (Reprise)<br />---well..it is there...this being a not so great song and rather flat in its texture, i would have preferred another song to fill this slot instead of a rehash , almost feels as if Webber did not have enough time to come up with much musical vartiety and stuck to a couple of musical themes.<br />5. Ladies...Gents! / The Coney Island Waltz (Reprise)<br />---More of the same...I must admit I was bored by this point in the plot....<br />6. Bathing Beauty<br />---cute, very much a Webber song, catchy.<br />7. \\"Mother, Did You Watch?\\"<br />---Incidental, no new musical themes, just the same: mix and match. Still effective.<br />8. Before The Performance<br />Lovely, if because of the reprise of till I hear you sing. No new musical themes, again, reprises put together.<br />9. Devil Take The Hindmost<br />---A reprise but with a lot of pressure in it, a critical point in the plot, quite effective, really nice.<br />10. Love Never Dies<br />---This one is not new to us, heard it in the beautiful game and heard it by dame Kiri, yet it works well here, after all it was conceived years ago for this show. Sierra B has a wonderful voice, but the high notes are a push in her range, we can still say it is a breathless performance, a thousand times better than Katerine Jenkins and her catastrophic attempt at this song.<br />11. \\"Ah, Christine!...\\"<br />---more of the same,nice mix of earlier themes<br />12. \\"Gustave! Gustave!...\\"<br />---As above, more incidental music and earlier musical themes intertwined.<br />13. \\"Please Miss Giry, I want to go back...\\"<br />---climatic yet melodic-less ending. The final musical theme reprises the aeria and remind me of the very ending of Superstar, John Nineteen Forty-One. Maybe too weak for an ending (for this show)<br /><br />So, do I like it? yes, overall a great musical that deserves many years on stage. I wish it had more original numbers and less reprises and that it did not have 'the beauty underneath' but hey, overall, a different show, this is not the phantom times 2, this is its own original show, with it's own personality. This show contains some of Webber's best ballads and melodies. Does it copy from his previous musical stock? yes, there is lots of Aspects of love, Woman in white and some Whistle down the wind...is it bad? well if we assume absolute originality as the definition of creativity, Sondheim has not been creative since Company, so there....and rather flat in its texture, i would have preferred another song to fill this slot instead of a rehash , almost feels as if Webber did not have enough time to come up with much musical vartiety and stuck to a couple of musical themes.  5.

B002L3RVCY|4.0|I'm only a casual fan of Star Wars (not into the books and graphic novels), so the Clone Wars TV series is perfect as it continues the story with familiar characters and fits comfortably between the blockbuster films. The animation is high quality and the choices for the character voices are spot on, evoking both the animated Clone Wars movie and the live-action films.<br /><br />I admit a little bit of the thrill is taken out when the realisation sets in that all the main characters are going to survive until Episode 3 \\"The Revenge of the Sith\\", where many of them won't even make an appearance or warrant a mention (Ventress? Ahsoka?).<br /><br />I find the characters a little 1-dimensional and the back story development nearly non-existent - but my 8-year-old loves everything about the Clone Wars, so they must be doing something right!
1401323820|3.0|By now, you already know that this novel is a tie-in to the TV show \\"Castle,\\" promoted as the first book in a series of Nikki Heat mysteries Richard Castle is writing based on his research with the NYPD.  And while there were a few amusing moments (e.g., naming the main character based on himself \\"Rook\\"), a few sex scenes ABC dare not show on broadcast television, and easily recognizable banter in the voices of the characters from the show, the heft and quality of the book simply do not live up to the reputation that the character Richard Castle has on the show.  This is a lightweight mystery, glib in tone, low on procedural detail and suspense, and lacking in credibility and pace.  Since it doesn't live up to the quality or suspense or thrills of leading mystery/thriller writers, it doesn't ultimately jibe with the Richard Castle character, and, therefore, is disappointing as a tie-in product.  In many ways, it would have been better as a tie-in utilizing the characters of the show than as a tie-in that purports to show a novel written by the main character on the show.
B00275EGWY|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />After reading many posts about 'HL', I've come to the conclusion that members of Explosives Ordinance Disposal (EOD) squads in the military are professionals who do a tough job well. There is nothing glamorous about being an EOD but 'Hurt Locker' is determined to give these soldiers the Hollywood treatment. Hence, one might come to the conclusion that there IS something exciting and glamorous about being a member of an EOD squad.<br /><br />SSgt. William James is more like a Mel Gibson loose cannon character from the Lethal Weapon series than a disciplined professional performing a difficult but routine job. Hollywood loves these loose cannon types but such a type does not really fit as a member of an EOD squad. Common sense will tell you that no EOD squad member would try and disarm an IED by going right up to it and cutting the wires with a plier. The bombs are always disposed of from a distance (as shown in the first scene with a robot--before it breaks down) so as not to endanger any soldiers or civilians in the vicinity.<br /><br />Quite a number of people who liked this movie felt there were too many 'quibblers'--that movies are not supposed to be 100% accurate. That's true but there should be a modicum stab at realism, especially when attempting to depict the gritty reality of the Iraq War. When an insurgent attempts to blow up a car loaded with bombs (without also trying to take out the soldiers at the scene) that seems a bit far-fetched. But to make matters worse, the car doesn't blow up even though it's totally on fire. But instead of letting the car burn (which might lead to an eventual explosion), SSgt. James puts the fire out and then disarms the bomb himself, wasting precious time and putting himself and his comrades in harms way.<br /><br />The EOD Squad seems to go everywhere outside their base without an escort. That would never happen in the real Army. What's more, most Army movies have interesting superior officers but not here. There's one good scene where a gung ho Colonel congratulates James for his loose cannon exploits but he's only on for a minute. There is also the Shrink who wants to see what's in like out in the field. Again, without an escort, he ends up the easy victim of an IED.<br /><br />The point is made that James becomes more and more unhinged as he is on the verge of completing his tour of duty. After he finds a boy dead after being tortured in a bomb factory, he mistakes him for another boy who sold DVD's to him in a marketplace. Wholly inappropriately, he kidnaps a merchant from the marketplace who he suspects of tipping off insurgents. Without regard to the consequences, he forces the merchant to drive into town and give him the name of someone who might have given the boy up. He even tells the merchant to wait for him while he goes into the house of an innocent Iraqi family but of course the merchant drives off. The whole pointless enterprise is resolved when the man's wife hits him and he runs out with a huge welt on his forehead. What's more, no one reports James when he returns, even though he's stopped and searched by sentries at the entrance to the base.<br /><br />Things get even more bizarre when James and his fellow EOD squad members are ordered to investigate a tanker explosion in the 'Green Zone' (how a tanker could get into the Green Zone, the most heavily protected area of Baghdad, I have no idea). Anyway, James gets the idea that this was not the work of a suicide bomber but a remote detonation near the scene of the explosion. Without a clue as to who might have been behind the crime, James orders the squad into an adjoining neighborhood where they (implausibly) split up and search for the faceless perpetrators. One of his guys is almost kidnapped but is saved only after James kills the bad guys but ends up shooting his EOD buddy in the leg. Again, James never gets into trouble for his antics and the whole incident never seems to be reported to his superiors.<br /><br />Despite the implausibility of many of the scenes, Hurt Locker still has enough action scenes to keep your interest. The depiction of the different kinds of explosive devices the insurgents keep coming up with seems pretty convincing (they even go as far as booby trapping the body of a boy they recently tortured and killed). While pure Hollywood hokum, the denouement, where James attempts to save an Iraqi man who has changed his mind about being a suicide bomber, is pretty exciting (again, no EOD squad member would be allowed to try and save a man in that position since such actions could jeopardize everyone's lives at the scene).<br /><br />While it appears that the film's scenarist did a modicum of homework finding out what's it like to be an EOD member in Iraq, he had little success in developing his characters. The interplay between James and Sgt. Sanborn was clich&eacute;d at the beginning, with the conservative Sanborn attempting to keep the wild James in check. Later the conflict dissipates and the relationship devolves into a flaccid buddy flick where the characters are reduced to enjoying themselves by punching each other in the stomach. The shaky hand-held camera technique gives the picture a documentary feel and the dialogue at times seems amateurishly improvised.<br /><br />Although Hurt Locker has been classified as an 'indie' film, it's really a traditional Hollywood picture. While HL doesn't shrink from showing the horrors of war, the protagonist, James, is the typical gung ho American hero that John Wayne would have probably loved. I am willing to forgive Hurt Locker for its implausible moments but sadly there isn't enough conflict generated between the principals to qualify as true art house fare.the implausibility of many of the scenes, Hurt Locker still has enough action scenes to keep your interest.

B001F7MSG6|5.0|The blu-ray transfer seems to be just as pretty as I remember from the theaters if not prettier. The sound quality is outstanding although I did *not* have a surround system hooked up for this particular film. Quite simply, if you enjoy this type of film this is a worthwhile purchase when the price is as low as when I got it.
B002LK3DUQ|3.0|I was very disappointed to learn that there were more behind the scenes featurettes on my friends blu ray version of this movie that we watched on her laptop than on this version I bought. As someone who loves this sort of extra feature but is not a technology snob, I felt cheated. I don't want to be forced into buying a blu ray player just to get all the special features.

142313494X|3.0|Now I hate to be like all these other reviews comparing this book to Harry Potter, but it has to be done.:) I did not find this book nearly as fascinating as Harry Potter. The lightning Thief goes VERY fast. There really was no time to develope good characters or to really choose sides, or understand the background of the story. A whole summer happens VERY quickly. And I its hard to describe what it is about this book...but it does not have the same \\"magical mystery\\" to it as Harry Potter.  Now the book as itself, not comparing it to any other books...was cute at best. It had some really funny parts, that I even laughed out loud. The author was very creative in that respect.  I really liked the fact that our hero \\"Percy Jackson\\" has ADHD and dyslexia. What an AWESOME way for kids with these problems to be able to exscape into a world where a \\"super hero\\" has the same disability! And it is this disability that MADE him special! As a parent and a teacher I loved that aspect.  I would say this is a great book to read allowed to you fourth or fifth grade class...or even to your kids at home. Maybe encourage them to read the series themselves. But as far as me being able to become \\"obsessed\\" with this series like Harry Potter...not so much. This is written for a MUCH younger audience. I realize Harry Potter was too...but it had many aspects that were appealing to adults as well.

B0000YEEGM|5.0|Charles Sanford \\"Charlie\\" Babbit is a self-centered Los Angeles-based automobile dealer/hustler/bookie who is at war with his own life. Charlie, as a young teenager, used his father's 1948 Buick convertible without permission and as a result, he went to jail for two days on account that his father reported it stolen. It is then that Charlie learns that his estranged father died and left him from his last will and testament a huge bed of roses and the car while the remainder will of $3 Million goes into a trust fund to be distributed to someone. Charlie seemed pretty angry by this and decides to look into this matter. It seems as if that someone is Raymond, Charlie's unknown brother, an autistic savant who lives in a world of his own, resides at the Walbrook Institute. Charlie then kidnaps Raymond and decides to take him on a lust for life trip to the west coast as a threat to get the $3 Million inheritance. Raymond's acts and nagging, including repeated talks of \\"Abbott & Costello\\", \\"Four minutes till Wapner\\" and refusal to fly on an airline except Quantas drives Charlie insane, and out of his selfish world into a cross-country trek of pure love and understanding that these two both have. Dustin Hoffman's performance as Raymond Babbitt is, bar none in this movie. Trying to put the reason that \\"Rain Man\\" is so great into words is simply impossible. It's got everything. Watch it, enjoy it.
B0035G9ABQ|5.0|As simultaneously funky and disconcerting as Demon Days was/is, Gorillaz have raised the stakes with Plastic Beach.  Thematically, the album is a philosophical musing that we can't ever really separate ourselves from that which we discard or dismiss. Musically, Plastic Beach is at first glance a stark mismatch of distinct talent scrounged the world over by Damon Albarn, though ultimately fitting together seamlessly.  It is a perfect amalgamation of seemingly disparate genres and musicians when listened as a whole, thereby raising the bar for music in this 21st century. It's an ominous, carefree, thumping, melancholy and affirming mix of something that possesses both humility and gravitas.     Sure, everyone knows the talent that contributed to Plastic Beach, but one of the greatest strengths of the album is that it is a gestalt piece, where everybody contributes to the theme rather than focusing on their own impact.  Albarn managed the talent impeccably, especially with relative newcomers like Little Dragon, Kano and Bashy.  About the only thing I could have done without was the advert-like effects on Superfast Jellyfish.  Other than that, every single track is a well-conceived standout. Plastic Beach is simply immaculate.
B002VECM4A|5.0|This adaptation of author Sapphire's best-selling novel about an overweight, illiterate African-American teen from Harlem who discovers an alternate path in life after she begins attending a new school. Clareece \\"Precious\\" Jones is only a teenager, yet she's about to give birth to her second child. Unable to read or write, Clareece shows little prospect for the future until discovering that she has been accepted into an alternative school. There, with a little help from a sympathetic teacher and a kindly nurse, the young girl receives something that most teens never get, a chance to start over again. First-time actress Gabby Sidibe gives a powerful, emotive performance. Equally good is talented actresses Mo'Nique, who is almost frightening as Precious' mother, and Patton as the compassionate teacher. Lenny Kravitz and Mariah Carey also have minor roles. The pacing seems to slow down unnecessarily toward the end and Precious's educational progression seems a bit confused and not completely fleshed out, but this is minor stuff. This is a very inspired work of art by someone with a fresh vision. This movie is a must see.

B00005V9HH|5.0|Police investigating an exploded boat on a San Pedro pier discover 27 bodies and $91 million worth of drug money. The only survivors are a severely burned and very scared Hungarian terrorist and Verbal Kint, a crippled con-man. Reluctantly, Kint is pressured into explaining exactly what happened on the boat. His story begins six weeks earlier with five criminals being dragged in by New York police desperate for suspects on a hijacked truck and ends with the possible identification of a criminal mastermind. \\"The Usual Suspects\\" is a complicated puzzle of a movie that I you can't watch just once. An amazing original screenplay and tight direction keep up a substantial amount of tension throughout. Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Benicio Del Toro, Kevin Pollak, Pete Postlethwaite, and Chazz Palminteri all give top-notch performances. But it is Kevin Spacey that makes \\"The Usual Suspects\\" work on all levels. Enjoyable the first time you watch it, even more enjoyable the second time round.
006056251X|5.0|Each story line Lisa Kleypas writes is enticingly satisying in every way, with completely differenct scenarios. When she writes the senual passionate scene between all the characters involved it isn't just gratifying, they are intensely unbearable. With this novel, every single moment that is shared, your pulse is repeatedly thundering against your skin, a mile a minute, past the point of no return. Your loins become immensely moistened, and lite ablaze. Your attention is captured as a fish dangling on a mighty hook. Unable to cease reading due to the fact you might miss something. And lack of sleep doesn't become an issue; especially when your mind is tightly wrapped around the concept & hope that Sebastian & Evie will be satisfied with each other, at the very end. Sebastian is so wickedly delicious & amorous.<br /><br />Knowing Lisa Kleypas's writing abilities very well with the numerous novels by her I've read thus far; she always writes with a happy ending in mind. However, discovering the journeys taken is truly magnificent and inspring. AN EXCELLENT WRITER/AUTHOR BEYOND COMPARE. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF HER NOVELS DESERVES WELL BEYOND A 10 STAR RATING!!

0307269981|3.0|Having read Larson's first book I expected more but was disappointed. It took a long time for the plot to develope and seemed more contrived than book one.  He uses violence more in this plot and in my opinion it diminishes the writing.  It did explain alot about the heroine's odd persona and dealing with her past but the end was predictable.  This book did not deal in any depth with Bjurman and that was disappointing.
B002JH3TW8|5.0|I'm using it to adapt a PreSonus FireBox into an Ableton Live setup on a new MacBook Pro 17\\" and it works perfectly. The cable is flexible so it's not cumbersome, it stays plugged in to the computer with enough force that I'm not worried that it will dislodge during recording or performance. Low enough profile so that other cables (USB, ethernet) will plug in as neighbors without touching or being forced in. Definitely would recommend.

B001OQCV2E|1.0|I went to this movie with three friends and, on our way through the exit, we asked one another whether any of us could think of a worse movie that we'd seen.  We all drew blanks.  If special effects made a movie great, this one would be a chart-topper.  But it takes more than that, and I just couldn't even begin to get around the two glaring flaws of this movie:  [1]  The pure cheesiness of the plot which mines every cliche that Hollywood has ever had; and [2] the completely incredible (literally) ability of the protagonists to survive disaster over and over again.  To sum up, this is a movie with awe-inspiring visuals, but with a plot worthy of poor animation.
B002RDCEX4|5.0|Like many, I heard this band when I watched 500 Days of Summer and I impatiently waited for the US to finally get their album. That wait was totally worth it though because this album is a very impressive major freshman album for a band and there isn't one track on the entire thing that I skip... well maybe the drum song :). I have listened to this CD many times and have yet to get sick of it. Check it out on a website like grooveshark and give the whole CD a listen before you buy... but I think you are really going to like it.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|we need to wait for the movie based on the book by John Sack called \\"An Eye for an Eye\\".  But, that will probably never happen because it was a real struggle for John to have even gotten his book published in the first place because of the delicate and warped sensitivities of the censors in America pressured by the JDL and others.
1608201236|5.0|Although each book in this series is great on it's own, I think it's really important that they should all be read and in the right order. The whole series should be offered as a set by someone, or one large hardback containing all five books.    I don't want to review the books as such, but to comment on my feelings. By the middle of Fatal Shadows, I was in love with Adrien and Jake. By the end of A Dangerous Thing, I was delighted with where we were heading. At the end of The Hell You Say, I was devasted. Just about all the way through Pirate King, my heart was in my throat. I had to rush through The Dark Tide, to make sure they were going to be OK. Of course I could have just read the ending first to make it easy on myself, but why deny myself the delightful  torture of taking the slow road.    I have read many books that I've loved, and characters that I have cared about and related to. But I have never before woken in the middle of the night, tossing and turning, worried about two fictional characters.    That Josh Lanyon was able to create  two characters that I came to care about more than some of my family,    is testament to his incredible talent. In my opinion there is no award available now, that is good enough for him.    I don't know why these books struck such a chord in my heart, and obviously they won't affect everyone in the same way, but I'm sure that everyone that reads them will enjoy them. I'm not sure that I will ever get over them, or be the same again.    I'm going back now to read Dark Side at a more leisurely pace and thouroughly savour every page.

B001UV4XWY|5.0|\\"The Box\\" is a metaphoric and atmospheric film, to say the least. That it is meant quite seriously becomes obvious through the deliberately serious acting by Cameron Diaz in a role unlike any other roles she has played.<br /><br />A mother close to her son approaching his teen years, a wife faithfully bound to a brilliant scientist-husband who has not yet earned an elusive success, a teacher who inspires her students in non-traditional ways--Diaz plays each with aplomb, with serious intent. I always think of Diaz as the co-star of that Vegas movie with the handsome Ashton Crutcher and her partially fluff role. There is NO fluff in \\"The Box.\\" This is a serious, even if freaky and strange, film about the nature of man/woman.<br /><br />When faced with a decision to push a button (no alerts needed here because the premise of the button is shown on every advertisement). We know she pushes it and that someone will die, but we don't know the consequences. Consequences...Wouldn't you just know that pushing a button to get millions BUT simultaneously causing someone's death would have consequences?<br /><br />The Prophet in the Old Testament warns  that there is nothing new under the sun--that we commit the same ol, same ol, over and over. \\"The Box\\" shows us that premise so clearly. It's the Garden. Here's the apple. Obey or eat it? We know that decision and those consequences, but a box? With a button? Causing someone's death? Didn't Eve's decision cause Death, more or less? Metaphor. Life is metaphor, symbol, virtual reality. This film is just a reflection.<br /><br />Diaz's character's decision is not arbitrary. We experience her day. We know she has this disintegrated foot which becomes part of the hallucinatory aspect of the film that contributes to the button-pushing decision. We know she is not a fluff character. This woman is a high school teacher who is discussing a Sartre play with her class when one of the students asks to see her foot. Oddly enough (as odd goes in this film), she removes her boot to show her foot. Cause-and-effect, cause-and-effect.<br /><br />Frank Langella plays the messenger, the delivery man, the executive's assistant who was struck by lightning only to become an other-ly type of human. He works for an-other, the \\"Boss.\\" God perhaps? If it's God, it's that God to which some attribute evil. A loving God would not force such a decision on his creation. Except--the concept of Free Will. I could make either case that Diaz has free will or is fated (because of Eve's long-ago decision, or even God's Will that humans be disobedient so that he can show the Way back to obedience).<br /><br />Dear Reader, do you \\"get\\" that this is a twisted film, full of darkness but potential light, OR light until darkness (evil decisions) enters? We are born into a \\"box\\" of our physical bodies, we live in boxes (houses), we travel in boxes (cars), we are buried in boxes. Langella's character points out the box metaphor (easily discerned). Much like good and evil, the box reflects man's nature. Good or evil? Both? And the decision? It hasn't changed. Just the consequences.boot to show her foot. Cause-and-effect, cause-and-effect.

B0033AX26I|4.0|Whether this is good or bad depends on just what it is that you're expecting in the unexpected...<br /><br />In my case, as I rushed to pre order this, my imagination ran wild as to the possibilities of an inspired mix of the Chieftains' Celtic musicianship with Cooder's bluesy slide guitar.<br /><br />Not.<br /><br />It's an eclectic fusion, all right, but a somewhat uneasy one, blending Tarahumara fiddle music with Irish jigs. Other than schmoozing with Paddy Molony in the promotional video, writing one song, and playing on two, Cooder barely puts in an appearance, though he is listed as co-producer.<br /><br />The CD is built around the story of the Batall&oacute;n de San Patricio, a unit of several hundred Irish expatriates who deserted the US Army and fought against the United States in the Mexican American War. Apparently Paddy has been obsessed with this obscure bit of history for some time, leading him to champion this unlikely project.<br /><br />Just as the presence of a battalion of Irish traitors or heroes (depending on whether you were Mexican or American) was certainly surprising, so is the sound of this unusual musical collaboration.<br /><br />Surprising yes. Appealing - well that depends on where you're coming from and what you're looking for.<br /><br />My favorite tune by far is Luz de Luna, (Light of the Moon) which features the wild, throaty crooning of Chavela Vargas. You won't be able to get it out of your mind...<br /><br />But when all is said and done, interesting as San Patricio is, I'm not sure I'm going to listen to it much. It's just a bit too bizarre for me.<br /><br />However, I do now know the origin of the name of Churubusco, a dumpy little New York town near the Canadian border. An unexpected benefit of buying San Patricio.
B001IYCMNA|5.0|Yes, this is billed as a business-class wireless access point, but it's great at home, too.<br /><br />This is a major step up from the Motorola B/G wireless access point I had been using, for several reasons:<br /><br />1) Maybe it's the 3-antenna system, but I have great wireless coverage throughout my entire house now. The computer in the furthest corner of the house used to get only 1 or 2 bars (and typically operated only at 10mbps even though it was connected at G speeds) with my old AP, but now every computer in the house sees the full 54mbps throughput<br /><br />2) My old access point, while it supported 54mbps G network speeds, connected to my switch via a 10mbps ethernet connection! So even well-connected wireless clients felt slow. This new switch connects at gigabit speeds to my gigabit switch, so all wireless traffic is much faster than before<br /><br />3) It supports ipv6!<br /><br />4) Great flexibility if you want it - this thing supports multiple SSID's (visible or hidden), VLAN and QoS (which I don't use), PoE (which I don't use), even support for a RADIUS server to help with security if you wish (which I also don't use). If you buy more than one you can use them as repeaters.<br /><br />It's not that much more than your average household-grade wireless access point, but seems well-worth it. My only gripe? You can give the AP a name on your network, and in theory connect to its management console via [...]&lt;name>, but that doesn't work for me. I can connect if I use its IP address, but on my network all clients at home get their IP addresses via DHCP... so figuring out the IP address the first time involved a bit of guesswork. I'm not sure why I can't connect via its name, but that hasn't been a blocker for me - only an annoyance. And my network topology isn't exactly what most people use at home so maybe that's at fault (I use a Windows 2008 Server edge box with all other clients connected through that). I am running firmware version 2.0.1.0 (the latest as of now).<br /><br />It supports N speeds, although the manual admits it's N-draft speeds, but I don't have any N(-final) devices to know if it supports N standard devices or not.<br /><br />I would recommend this product.<br /><br />Update 3/23/10: My wife recently bought home a new Lenovo laptop from work, and it connects at N speeds to this AP with no problems. I'm jealous of her ~130mbps connection! (all of my machines are still 'only' connecting at G speeds). So any doubts that this works at N speeds is now erased in my mind - and only made me happier that I bought this great AP.hough the manual admits it's N-draft speeds, but I don't have any N(-final) devices to know if it supports N standard devices or not.

B001AEF6BI|1.0|I had to watch this movie in Psych class last semester. The entire time all I wanted to do was punch each of the kids in the face and tell them to stop acting like such whiny little brats. Bender, the \\"outcast-druggie\\" stereotype was possibly the most obnoxious character I've ever seen in a movie. He basically spent the entire time aggravating the other characters (and me at the same time) who were equally annoying in their reactions to him (they ALWAYS took the bait, ALWAYS responded like he wanted them to. Seriously, don't you learn in preschool to plug your ears and say \\"I'm not listening, I'm not listening\\"?).    Then at the end they magically become friends, and 2 pairs of them start dating, which also got on my nerves, because it was SO unrealistic.

B001B1UO6W|5.0|A child's toy possessed with the soul of a serial killer attempts to transmigrate his soul into the young boy's body, while leaving a trail of bodies in his wake. Chucky may have become the butt of all jokes in the 20 years since the release of the original film, but there is no denying that CHILD'S PLAY broke amazing new ground in special FX and the killer doll theme. It is unfortunate that Brad Dourif will always be remembered for this role, since he only has a limited screen presence, however his characterization as the notorious Chucky is as memorable as it is forceful and frightening. With more fun performances by Chris Sarandon, Catherine Hicks, and Alex Vincent, the film takes a cheesy B-movie plot and steps it up to an iconic late-80s Slasher. Though the body count is low, and there really isn't much blood, the incredible movement and design makes Chucky completely convincing. The marriage of costumed little people acting on enlarged sets with the animatronic doll is pretty seamless, and blows away any of the computerized FX used in the later films. Mancini's critical look at consumer culture reads heavily in the film, but is not so forceful as to take away from its entertainment. It goes without saying that this is a staple Horror classic!<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies
0807014273|5.0|Part essay about his time in the concentrations camps, part psychiatric tract based on those experiences, Viktor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning is one of the most important books I've read.  It is not surprising that there are more than 12M copies in print and that it's been named one of the ten most influential books.      In the first 100 pages, Frankl recounts the time he spent in the camps from 1942-1945.  Anyone who has read other accounts of the camps or seen movies of them knows the depravities there.  But Frankl's account is somewhat unique in that he approaches the experience as a psychiatrist, in a very clinical fashion, only using emotion here and there to spice his writing.  His writing is perceptive, showing a keen empathy for not only those who were heroic in such places, but also those who were not.  This goes for both the prisoners as well as the German guards.   He explains the psychology of lowered expectations, how a simple de-lousing, for example, could be the source of so much happiness for the prisoners.  And given the title, it's not surprising he spends much time talking about meaning.  The whole premise of his book is that humans are driven by their search for meaning.  And in these pages, he demonstrates how meaning in a prisoner's life, whether it be a family to get back home to or work still left to be done, literally was the difference between life and death in many cases.    This leads to the second part of the book, called Logotherapy in a Nutshell.  Logotherapy is a therapy Frankl pioneered after his experiences in the camps.  In it, a patient is `actually confronted with and reoriented toward the meaning of his life'.  He talks of the existential vacuum, in which so many people now languish due to the complexity of having so many choices and a lack of traditions to fall back on.  Logotherapy simplifies this for us.  According to it, meaning can come from three places: creating work or doing deeds, experiencing something or encountering someone (love), 3) or by our attitude to unavoidable suffering.      To me, this puts logotherapy in the realm of religion, especially eastern religion.  It's about human transcendence.  Frankl says here that we derive meaning by helping others (through deeds or work), putting another above ourselves (loving someone), or by seeing unavoidable suffering as something of meaning in its own right.  These ideas seem Buddhist to me, and in this case I applaud the convergence of science and spirituality in a space that needs it.       I found this book inspirational.  The experiences of the concentration camps by themselves are enough to put matters in harsh perspective for anyone living in freedom.  But Frankl's expanding of this information into a book that can help so many others is a fine example of his own theories.  We are lucky to have such a work available to us.
B000P0J0A6|5.0|The sleepy town of Kingston Falls is in for a world of trouble when Billy receives a cute little pet Mogwai for Christmas. Billy is given three easy rules to follow to keep his pet safe, but when he breaks two of them by mistake, the creature spawns a horde of mischievous little monsters that are bent on murder and mayhem! It is a Christmas we will never forget in GREMLINS, the classic creature-feature from 1984 that has left a permanent impression on pop-culture. Joe Dante works from various childhood influences like Looney Tunes and Merry Meoldies to create a wacky world of cartoon chaos, using the incredibly artistry and animatronics of Chris Walas to bring these tiny terrors to life. The creature designs are so nasty and finely articulated that they become indistinguishable from real life. Steven Spielberg's influence is always apparent in the picturesque setting of Kingston Falls. That is, until the Gremlins take over! What starts with cruel jokes and minor tampering turns into full blown madness as the monsters tear up the town and terrorize the neighbors. Dante always keeps the mood lighthearted and fun for all ages despite some of the darker tones and frightening monsters. Add to that the unforgettable characters created by Zach Galligan, Phoebe Cates, Hoyt Axton, and the legendary Dick Miller, and you have a timeless classic to carry on the holiday horror tradition for years to come.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B0018O4YT0|5.0|With a dark mixture of the Gothic grandeur in METROPOLIS, the eerie make-up of NOSFERATU, and the alternate realities of THE MATRIX, DARK CITY borrows from several sources to create a masterful horror fantasy world with its own unique set of laws and identity. A man with a stolen memory must escape from a group of beings stalking him in a world that they shape and control, while trying to remember his past and figure out how and why they have created this city shrouded in eternal darkness. Though elements of the production may feel borrowed, the plot itself is creative and original, acting as both a murder/mystery and Sci-Fi thriller with horrific themes of the loss of personal identity, mind-control, and distorted perceptions of reality. The cast selection fits the film very well, with Sewell, Connelly, and Friels capturing a nostalgic Film Noir. One of the most impressive aspects of the film is the incredible set design paired with excellent computer FX, giving the cold city an organic life as it shifts and molds to The Strangers sinister designs. This gives it a modern epic feel, while the sepia tones and color palette deliver a throwback to classic Sci-Fi ventures like The Twilight Zone.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B00027JYLC|5.0|A family of circus performers is broken apart when a beautiful acrobat seduces one of the dwarfs in order to steal his fortune, but when the plot is discovered the group rallies to oust their betrayer. FREAKS is easily Tod Browning's crowning achievement. While his interpretation of DRACULA may have created some of the genre's most defining moments, his visual storytelling and stylism are far exceeded in this film. It is so rich in character, depicting the so-called \\"freaks\\" in such an endearing and human manner, while showing the most cruel and intolerable sides of the \\"normal\\" characters. Every single performance is genuine and sincere, transposing the viewer into a fly on the wall in what feels like an honest portrayal of true events. On top of the superb characterizations, the incredible carnival settings give the film even more authenticity, painting the backdrop in stimulating curves and High Gothic atmosphere. The final nightmarish sequence where the carnival folk stalk the vile Cleopatra through the mud and rain is the only moment of true horror, but while it stands out as the most frightening moment in the film, it also contradicts the positive portrayal of the freaks established throughout the rest of the plot. FREAKS is a film classic that transcends the genre, and is a must-see for all film fans.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies
B000002JEV|5.0|The 1969 sessions on disc 1 are gritty and powerful, sometimes even more so than the studio recordings of the same material. Zeppelin performs originals like the fine folkish \\"What Is And What Should Never Be\\", the fiery rave-up \\"Communication Breakdown\\", and the psychedelic \\"Dazed And Confused\\", but the majority of the 14 songs are blues covers.  The Otis Rush-hit \\"I Can't Quit You Baby\\" gets the Zeppelin treatment, along with Sleepy John Estes' \\"The Girl I Love She's Got Long Black Wavy Hair\\" (one of the highlights of the album), and Willie Dixon's all-time classic \\"Whole Lotta Love\\".  Robert Johnson's \\"Traveling Riverside Blues\\" is another highlight; a tremendous electric rendition burning with Jimmy Pages' urgent slide guitar playing. And Zep's piano-driven blusn n' boogie version of Eddie Cochran's \\"Somethin' Else\\" is pure rock n' roll fun.  You will note that a couple of songs are here in two different versions...the two renditions of \\"Communication Breakdown\\" are quite similar, while the second takes of \\"I Can't Quit You Baby\\" is two minutes longer than the first.    Disc 2 is highlighted by a tight, muscular \\"Immigrant Song\\", a swaggering \\"Heartbreaker\\", and a crushing rendition of the tough blues \\"Black Dog\\". Well, I could go on and on, really. A beautiful, evocative \\"Stairway To Heaven\\", a great take on the acoustic folk-ballad \\"That's The Way\\", and a 14-minute medley of \\"Whole Lotta Love\\", John Lee Hooker's \\"Boogie Chillun\\", Bukka White's \\"Fixin' To Die\\", Arthur Crudup's \\"That's All Right\\", and the wonderful R&B-stomper \\"A Mess Of Blues\\" (Pomus/Shuman).    The sound and mixing on both discs is excellent, and the performances are almost uniformly great...rough and tough but by no means sloppy. Robert Plant is in fine form all the way through, and Jimmy Page completely fulfills the listener's expectations, playing crunchy rhythm guitar and creative, bluesy solos.  The ten-to-twenty minute versions of \\"Dazed And Confused\\", \\"You Shook Me\\", and \\"How Many MoreTimes\\" are perhaps something of an acquired taste, and this is not really the place for newcomers to start, but fans will be delighted by these fiery, energetic live-in-the-studio recordings by Led Zeppelin in their prime.
