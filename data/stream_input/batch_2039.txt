B000J5XS3C|5.0|I use this mixer 3 to 4 times a month for receiving audio to be recorded to my PC and for live sound. Works great and easy to use. The power cord is a bit finicky, so be sure you have it in a place where the cord won't get knocked.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|its ok, having trouble getting allies .  it is addictive.  definitely worth getting.<br />graphics are fantastic.  i would definitely recommend this one.
B002W1UEW4|5.0|Good movie. I wasn't sure whether I would like it or not, but I did. Now I just need to eventually add it to my movie collection.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I've listened to Jon Schmidt's music for over 13 years and it has always been some of my favorite music, but this combination with the cello is absolutely amazing.  The musical talent that oozes out of these tracks will leave you listening to them over and over again!
B000NVIXDW|5.0|Michael Buble is always a joy to listen to and sing with. His style is Sinatra-esque with a modern style attached. I love it!
B004APVI1G|4.0|Is it me or does this movie feel like Star Wars except with owls? I could help but think of Obi Wan saying to Luke, \\"Use the gizzard Luke... Use the gizzard!\\" Oh well... Still liked the movie. Kids liked it too (ages 10 and 12). My 6 year old thought that the owl fighting scenes were a little scary. The 3D effects were good. For 15 bucks, definitely worth it!
B007SGM084|4.0|I read all 3 in 6 days...couldn't put it down.Yeah it's not reality..what women has those kind of orgasms every time she has sex? DUH? Still loved it though.It wqs almost everything I would not do...I could never deal with that controlling,possesive,dominant guy,that's what made it fun.The sex scenes were hot without being pornographic...they were just graphic :)<br />Highly recommend!
B008602KQI|5.0|Loved the movie. It was a bit confusing at times, and the ending really left me hanging. Everyone tells me I need to read the book to really understand it, so I'll do that next!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|pretty cool so far. nice graphics on original kindle fire. wish the cool horses and gear didn't cost real money/gems though. can still play basic horses for free.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It doesn't start out very difficult, but increasingly you need to plan your moves and it's quite addictive! Simple and definitely continuous fun!
B004ZG5F28|5.0|If you haven't seen Bridget Jones's Diary (or it's been a while) you're missing out on a hilarious romp. Bridget decides to make a few changes in the new year, from job, to men, to bad habits she's picked up over the years. Renee Zellweger is at her comic best in this role.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|What more can you ask of a product than it does exactly what it is designed to do and without problems.  Let me add at this point that Amazon's Kindle support is beyond expectations.  They trouble shot my problem in moments, gave me a  credit for replacing the cord which I received in 2 days.  That dear friends is had service to beat.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Not exactly a Chessmaster program, or an in-depth game teaching app.  But its great for killing time and just keeping sharp.
B00470TOV0|5.0|Brought this for the kindle.  Brought the cheaper version, non HD.  Seems fine to me.  Very convenient and easy. Nice use for the device :)  So much for reading...
B009KKLQKO|5.0|and great price. I love the  beach boys and am so happy to hear more magical music from them. brian Wilson is my favorite artist.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|Adele has such a full, rich voice which is pleasing and enjoyable.<br /><br />I purchased this for my Ipod (which I haven't figured out how to use yet).
B008HK3XOU|5.0|Great!  I love how this product stands up.  Makes it easier to play games and do work on the kindle
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Reminiscent of Bioshock. Scary adventure under the sea, with Lovecraftian overtones. G5 always seems to hit the mark and this game is awesome!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I recommend this book because it was a good book.<br /><br />I rate it 5 stars because I love it so much
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Clearly laid out. Written in an easy conversational style. I've been around gyms and bodybuilders and IM comfortable saying this guy knows what he is talking about.<br /><br />Get this book !!
B009LDD5E0|1.0|I love Glee and have all three seasons but I will not pay that much for season four.  I'll wait.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|If you're a fan of Friends, you really owe it to yourself to save up and get this DVD box set. I wish Friends were available through a streaming service, like Netflix or Hulu, but it's not. This, however, is the next best thing - even better if you like special features!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really liked this book, It was a little slow in the beginning,But a good read, not recommended for young peeps.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Being pregnant and a house wide I get bored easy, this game it's great to entertain me for hours while I lay in bed on bed rest!
B008HK3XOU|5.0|Simple to use.  Love the Auto on auto off feature.  It protects the kindle well and is easy for my 10 year old to use,  Makes reading comfortable!
B001EN71DG|5.0|If you want to watch the original Star Wars trilogy on DVD as it was before George Lucas f@#%ed it up, this box set is one of your only options.<br /><br />Included in this box set are bonus discs containing the original Star Wars trilogy on DVD as it was before George Lucas f@#%ed it up. You're going to spend a lot, because this isn't made anymore, and there aren't many left. Real Star Wars fans pretty quickly snatch 'em up. I highly recommend getting one of these, because the price is only going to go up, unless Disney (which bought the rights to the Star Wars franchise) produces DVDs or Blu-rays (or whatever format) of the original Star Wars trilogy as it was before George Lucas f@#%ed it up.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Very entertaining book so how you wish love could be, A good read for anyone whom loves to read truely.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|Great book! Both this one, and the first (matched) both ended right in the middle it seemed like though. Can't wait to see what's in store in reached!!
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Good acting, funny storyline and easy to rent with Amazon Prime. Some of the subject matter may not be suitable for young kids.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game because it feels like you really own your own horse. I also love this game because it is so easy to get coins.
B005PK4ZHY|5.0|Loved Desperate house wives from the very first  time it was broadcast on ABC , so sad when it was ended.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook is the best way to keep in touch with friends, near and far, young and old, and to stay informed. The only problems are 1. its addictive, and 2. its ruining people's ability to actually talk to each other.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|I get that most games like this aren't truly free but you should make a note in your description that only part of the game is free and that you have to pay for the whole game! It's just being honest about what you're offering
B007SGM084|5.0|One of the best series I've ever read!!! Absolutely amazing! I would love it if she does all the books from Christians point of view!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|kept my interest more, A good read for older people , sexually active ,was good tho ,would recommend to read.
0307719774|5.0|I love this little journal so far. It really has some great questions and I am really excited to see how my answers change throughout the years.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Never boring, aleays dynamic.<br />Only incredible is the fact that a president's son could be that ingaged in black ops,.. A bit surreal..
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Got it as free App of the day so I will be donating a couple of bucks (App is that good).<br />The sleep clock is a great bonus (has anti burn option).<br />To exit w/o having to use FC/Task Manager deselect Run in backround in options.<br />A stop button whould have been a little better.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another outstanding read from Sparks.  He really writes a truly delightful romance with unusual circumstances.  Can't wait to read another of his novels!
B00A2BTCM4|5.0|It is a masterpiece in music. It is like discovery all over again. It is still in my car stero.
0142419400|1.0|Perkins is definitely a talented writer as far as the technical stuff goes. Her prose flows nicely, Anna has a distinct voice (the only distinct voice in the novel, sadly), and not once did her writing feel strained or forced. She's actually good, which is why my intense dislike of this book is disappointing. There was also a scene in the novel between Anna and her little brother Seany that made me smile because it was sweet and touching and realistic, and a few jokes here and there that made me laugh. But otherwise a lot of my feelings towards Anna and the French Kiss consist of intense dislike... okay I'll be honest, more like actual hate. There were several times when I honestly had to put the book down and walk away for a while because I was getting so angry.<br /><br />I don't generally have a problem with books or movies that concern themselves solely with how the main characters get together. I find that the key to getting me interested in giving me good characters who work wonderfully together and level each other out. But I have to actually like the characters and their type of relationship if I'm going to spend a few hours reading their journey together.<br /><br />I did not like Anna and St. Clair's relationship, and you can pretty much blame St. Clair for that.<br /><br />St. Clair, or &Eacute;tienne, is pretty much a jerk. He's not intended to come across that way--in fact he's written to be the most perfect boyfriend a girl or guy could ever ask for. For most of the novel he comes across as too perfect, actually. Until we get to the reason why he and Anna can't get together for most of the novel: He won't break up with his current girlfriend, Ellie. Even though it's extremely obvious to everyone, probably even Ellie herself, that he's no longer in love with her, he won't call it off. He would rather be miserable with her than initiate a change in his life, since it's stated in the book that he's afraid of change.<br /><br />I'm sorry but that's the worst thing to do to a person. It's disrespectful, to put it quite frankly, and it's wrong to treat a person you supposedly loved at some point like that. For much of the book, while Anna was hating on Ellie (which I'll get to in a moment, oh will I ever), I just kept thinking \\"Just wait, Anna. If he's doing this to Ellie, he'll do it to you one day.\\" As one would expect, that kind of put a huge damper on the whole romantic storyline. The plot line with Ellie just felt like a very weak, very convenient way to keep &Eacute;tienne and Anna from getting together too fast.<br /><br />So given my intense dislike for &Eacute;tienne, the book was already kind of doomed for me. After all, I have to like the other half of the couple if I'm going to be invested in a romance novel.<br /><br />But I could handle disliking &Eacute;tienne if the rest of the book could make up for his jerkitude. Unfortunately there was more that irritated me than just &Eacute;tienne.<br /><br />The secondary characters were pretty much just that. They came in and said stuff when the plot needed it (this is especially apparent in Meredith's case) and then left so the book could focus on Anna and &Eacute;tienne again. In the case of Meredith, Anna's first new friend when she arrives in Paris, she's in love with &Eacute;tienne as well. I was hopeful that Meredith and Anna could settle things peacefully, or Meredith would admit her feelings to &Eacute;tienne and then back off to let him decide who he wanted to be with. But no, of course Meredith takes it out on Anna instead of being cross with &Eacute;tienne that he never discouraged her or made it plain that he wasn't interested in being anything other than friends. Every time Anna and &Eacute;tienne are remotely romantic with each other in front of their group of friends, Meredith gets jealous and pouty. These are pretty much the only times she's present so it stands out.<br /><br />Then of course there's Ellie, who meets Anna once and seems to like her okay. But then when &Eacute;tienne is asking for Anna when he's drunk, Ellie gets jealous and hateful towards Anna. Of course. Because we can't have just one girl being all possessive and jealous to another girl over a guy; no, we have to have two! At one point Anna actually imagines causing Ellie bodily harm, when she should be angry with &Eacute;tienne for stringing Ellie and her along for close to a year. Then there's the stereotypical \\"slutty,\\" \\"bitchy,\\" rich popular girl Amanda who dislikes Anna on sight because &Eacute;tienne is paying more attention to Anna than her. I don't think it's a mere coincidence, either, that \\"slutty\\" is used often in conjunction with Ellie and Amanda. Ellie dresses up as a slutty nurse for Halloween, Amanda is mentioned to have revealing clothing on most of the time. Anna, it's mentioned, is still a virgin. I don't think I'm wrong in believing the comparisons were deliberate there.<br /><br />Can we put these tropes/cliches to bed, already? I am tired of seeing girls fighting each other for a guy, especially a jerk like &Eacute;tienne. It reinforces so, so many unpleasant stereotypes about women, and it teaches us that we should fight instead of supporting each other, while the guy gets away with bad behaviour, and I'm just sick of it. Yes, eventually Anna does stand up for Meredith against Amanda, but by that point it was too little, too late.<br /><br />I wish I could have liked Anna and the French Kiss more than I did. I suppose it's a good thing it made me feel something, even if that something was intense hatred for all the cliches and offensive stereotypes the novel used. Despite the fact that I was not impressed with this novel, I'd be interested in seeing what else Perkins has to offer due to her talented writing. I can only hope she creates better, more sympathetic characters for her next novel, and doesn't reinforce so many unpleasant stereotypes about women and romance.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple run 2 is a very fun and addictive game. I definitely recommend this game for any kid who is a fan of the first Temple run. Temple run 2 has improved alot compared to the old Temple run game. You can glide down ropes, ride mine carts, and so much more! In the last game you were chased by a group of angry demon monkeys. Now, giant mama monkey is speeding her way to rip you to shreds. And boy, can she run! I didn't have any problems with the game until yesterday. I was running and I collected 3 gems and I died and I tapped the &quot;save me&quot; button but it said I had no gems... So if you could fix it, that would be great. Anyway, Temple run 2 is one of the most amazing and addictive games I have ever played. You can download it for free on your device too! Enjoy your game!
B007BFSYMS|1.0|To get Temple Run 2 for free, I installed the Amazon App store (which I don't mind).  But on my first attempt to 'purchase' Temple Run 2, I accidentally downloaded White Noise.  Then When the two programs came up to install, I wasn't paying attention and installed White Noise.<br /><br />It's too loud.  None of the sounds were soothing.  I guess if you put it under your pillow, it wouldn't be a problem, but none of the noises appealed to me.<br /><br />But, I suppose if you were in a hotel room near a busy street you could put this near the window to drown out traffic.  I don't know.  It's the first time I had to uninstall something from my phone.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|This is a great G-rated game for the kids and the whole family to play. Also can't go wrong for $.99
0451450523|5.0|I watched the movie a dozen times as a kid, and then another dozen as an adult, and no matter how many times I saw \\"based on the book by Peter S. Beagle\\", I never once thought about buying and reading the book. Then, by chance maybe, it showed up in my recommendations on Good Reads. So I read it, and I am so very glad that I did. Everything was so wonderful about this book that I don't even know where to start in trying to prove my point. I loved the characters, even the little ones, like the weeping spider and Molly Grue's cat. The songs were fun and all the fairy tale elements made me smile and laugh and even cry. Yes, this beautiful book brought me to tears - multiple times. And when I finished the final page, the very first thing I wanted to do was read it again. That is something that has never happened to me before. If that doesn't tell you how awesome this book is, I'm not sure what will. Read this book, or die unhappy.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Loved every song on the album! So many music styles all wrapped up in one. I've had it on repeat since day one!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This is a lot harder than Subway surfer.  It's a lot more varied, and I guess variance is good.  You feel good when you go a long way, although sometimes I think the difficulty curve jumps too abruptly.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|a classic - hard to give away as a present - such a lesson - Dr. Seuss rocks - thanks
B007BDK3SS|4.0|I liked the game. Found it challening (at times too challenging which is why the 4 stars) with good visuals.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Safe Haven is just the second Nicholas Sparks book I've read, but I'm quickly becoming a fan. There are twists and turns with a beautiful love story at its core. I can't wait to see the movie in February!

B002HWRYJE|5.0|It's star trek - of course I loved it. thanks for sending it to me - what - last year or beffore.....
B006CHML4I|5.0|I bought this to be an every day watch. Also bought a timex brown leather strap with it, changed the strap to dress it up.<br />I wanted something different from the usual metal watch with a metal band, but it was meant to be something that can be worn in a professional office environment. The face is not big, so it does not fit the current style of oversized watches (which I dislike) and it may look small on some wrists (fits fine on mine). With a brown leather strap this watch looks dressed up and perfect for its intended purpose without breaking the bank.<br />The winding mechanism after wearing it for a full day lasts about an additional 12-18 hours (have not timed it). Not as good as a previous Seiko automatic watch I had, but I feel that is a good enough compromise for the price.
B008ELUEQC|4.0|If you are a fan of  Rod Stewart and classic Christmas songs, then this is the CD for you. Great buy!
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I have used Avast antivirus in my computers for years free & love it so I was so pleased it was available for my Nexus7 & our Kindle,<br />I installed in both & it works great. I also installed it in my daughter's tablet. Would advise anyone to try it.

B00A77II0U|5.0|Story was great! Graphics amazing! Couldn't put it down! Loved all of the hidden items and decoders as well as the clear and beautiful visuals.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I really liked this book because it is very inspiring to any women who is in a situation that is difficult to get out.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Wish it did last longer at first. Can't afford to buy coins. Fun, but I get frustrated when run out of coins.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|another version of the birds game - dumb worthless game - best part is that it was free for the kindle
B007SSDBBM|5.0|Absolutely adore this movie!<br />I discovered this because I love Hugh Jackman and wanted to see a romantic comedy with him and I fell in love with it!<br />I was skeptical because the description sounded dumb but it was very well done. Jackman plays the part perfectly and is adorable in it!<br />Meg Ryan also plays the other lead very well.<br />I am definitely going to buy it.<br /><br />I don't even typically like romantic comedies and I loved this movie! So I definitely recommend it, especially if you like Hugh Jackman ;)
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|This is a great game. It's so much fun. It's great for adults and children alike. The music is awesome. The art is great--I love the little moon, she's so cute and the planets are pretty cute too. The game play is simple but really engaging. I highly recommend this game.
630542845X|5.0|Very interesting take on the likes of a person being born in the flesh with the truth of the invisible many think they know.  How the world reacted to such truth through fear and misunderstanding is right on.  If Jesus walked the earth today or any man was blessed from above with the power to heal and do miracles, the world would crucify him again.  God bless.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|another version of the dumb worthless birds game - has been deleted - glad it was free - got downloaded duringn christmas a long with several others.
B005UBNKZG|5.0|This is a great and affordable processor with 8-core and 3.1GHZ. I was able to build a web server in combination with the corasair 16GB and another additional DDR3 module, and it is as fast as expected as you can see here at cosmosurf.net.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was one of the best books I have ever read.  I couldn't stop thinking about it long after finishing it.  Not only is it a beautiful love story but makes you think about living the rest of your life as a quadrapalegic
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|I was not impressed with the movie at all. It was weird to say the least. I would not waste your money.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|dumb worthless game my neice put on the kindle - nothing more to say but have to use up more words
B0082SU98U|5.0|A real classic that every young girl should read(even if you're 54 when you read it for the first time).Wonderful!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I really enjoy the variety of sound in this app. They are fun and many are calming and make a lovely background noise...
B00AWTSRZY|5.0|Awesome!!! This was much better than the first part. The special fetures were really cool as well and I still plan on buying this for bluray next week.
B0034G4P4O|4.0|sorry for the delay in letting you know it arrived safely and was enjoyed. Thanks so much it was a cute show
031620157X|4.0|I did enjoy the story quite a bit. It was rife with clever things and originality. However, the writing itself was a bit clumsy- for lack of a better word. I feel like perhaps the manuscript was edited for spelling and grammar, but not the writing itself. It's been months since I read the book, so I can't think of any specific examples, though there was one in the prologue where something like &#34;mirror&#34; was used twice in one sentence. There were also a few instances where kids didn't act their age, (ig, when a teacher uses the word &#34;bastardized&#34; in front of a young class and none of them seemed to bat an eye) but they weren't enough to pull me entirely out of the story. Well, except for &#34;bastardized.&#34;<br /><br />Overall, it was an enjoyable read, but I wouldn't hold it up as an example for new writers.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I did like the first one. The First one was lacking on the the graphics and game play. But the 2nd one improves those aspects. I would say this a complete game now.
0143119680|1.0|I bought the book \\"A Discovery of Witches\\" by Deborah Harkness because I thought it had all the elements of an interesting fantasy read and, after all, it was written by a university professor with all sorts of academic awards and her own award-winning wine blog. How could I go wrong? At least, I thought, she should be able to write well. I had just finished reading \\"Cloud Atlas,\\" a complicated and sometimes frustrating, but brilliantly written book, and was looking for something a bit more fun. I literally had to stop reading \\"Witches\\" after about 18 pages. I have not read such awful prose by anyone since about fifth grade (maybe fourth).  It wasn't merely boring, full of meaningless filler sentences, but downright childish. Here's an example from p. 18, where the protagonist, a witch, is describing a vampire observing her in the library: \\"This one was tall--well over six feet even accounting for the problems of perspective associated with looking down on him from the gallery. And he definitely was not slight. Broad shoulders narrowed into slender hips, which flowed into lean, muscular legs. His hands were strikingly long and agile, a mark of physiological delicacy that made your eyes drift back to them to figure out how they could belong to such a large man.\\" Beyond the unbelievably immature syntax, \\"agile\\" is not an appropriate descriptor of hands at rest; the word \\"agile\\" connotes dexterity of movement. Hands also do not convey \\"physiological\\" delicacy; physical, maybe, but certainly not physiological, unless the vampire used his hands as a stomach or some other organ that processes solids, liquids or gases.  As I was reading this awful paragraph I got the distinct impression that maybe I had accidentally chosen a book from the gothic romance/bodice-ripper genre. But no, all the splendid reviews from a variety of supposedly knowledgeable sources (USA Today, the Los Angeles Times, People, etc.) seemed to believe this book was a serious addition to the science fantasy literary category. I am often amazed at the junk that Americans read and view on TV, but often the critics get it right, correctly and sometimes brutally panning bad writing, acting or directing. The question I have is not what this book is doing in the marketplace (because as we know publishers will publish anything if they think it will make money), but how so many smart people in positions of responsibility in publishing could get it so wrong.
B008QE9XD2|1.0|it arrived safely and was watched - stupid - it was quicky wrapped and given to the inlaws for a present
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Seriously. Just buy series 2. You saw series 1. You know the show is brilliant. Martin Freeman is made of kittens and Benedict Cumberbatch will take the tube covered in... Well, I won't spoil it. I mean, come on. The show won a BAFTA. Stop looking at my review and look at BBC's Sherlock.
B00A77II0U|5.0|this game is awesome. loads of fun.great music and incredible graphics.worth the money. don't hisitate just buy it.this game took several hours to play.thrum.

B006FYHTFO|4.0|Like some others I know, I bought this soundtrack partly because I wanted the violin reel from the stag party and the one from the closing credits. Neither are on this album. The soundtrack itself is still great, but if you were only looking for those tracks, you might be disappointed by just about everything but Romanian Wind.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Fun,best I've played yet. Fun, fun, fun, fun, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I was not a fan of this game. For me, it was lacking some fun. I guess I was missing the crowds at the Bingo Halls. Maybe I will give it another try at a later date.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|cute show - sorry it's been a couple of years to say thank you - it was received safely and enjoyed
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I imagine you've already seen series 1 since you're looking at series 2. What confuses me is why you're bothering to read reviews. If you've seen series 1, then you already KNOW that this show deserves far more stars than I can give it. Legitimately. This series is worth every penny if for nothing more than to watch Minerva McGonagall and Harriet Jones, Prime Minister go at it. Why are you still reading this review? Go up and hit the buy-button.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|If you liked the other Angry Birds games this app doesn't disappoint. Highly recommend it. And it is free, can't beat that.

1601252463|4.0|Perhaps the most required Pathfinder supplement, as it sets the tone for all that follow.  It includes 6 new classes and a lot of new options that are later expanded in other books.  If you are going to get just one supplement for Pathfinder, this is probably the best choice.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book so much definitely a cliffhanger at the end!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Going to get the next book!!!!!!!! Yay yay!!!!!!!!!!
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|another bird game that was downloaded on the kindle during Christmas - best part is that it was free. thanks
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|It's great but there's one problem it has no mobs it's like peaceful minecraft but it's still as great as minecraft pocket edition free!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have been playing nonstop for the past few days! The game sometimes crashes but not very often. Way better than the first temple run!
B009O2XY12|2.0|Maybe because I don't understand the entire game, but find it boring after shooting some of the bubbles.  that is all I can do because there is no instructions to go further into the game.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|when did I get this? 2 or 3 years back - so sorry for the late thank you - it was enjoyed
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love the new version of temple run. It is so much fun. I recommend this game for the people who love to run;)??
B00B2V66VS|2.0|This app is glitchy if I turn he jumps if you touch him by accident he either jump or turn its so anoying because he want get anywhere
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Characters, scenery, clothing, plot and history are fantastic!  It's son good to watch something that isn't loaded with the f-bomb!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|cute show - must have been a gift - I remember watching it - sorry I didn't do this before
B0086700CM|4.0|It is pretty good.. it's not as good as the second but still can be very fun. I enjoy it allot
B008F281Y2|5.0|The score is not a bad movie,anything with robert De Niro is worth watching, he's one of the best actors in the world,that being said.when I ordered this. product detail on aspect ratio reads 1.85:1,when it came in the mail, It was 2.35:1,which I love.so I think It's  only in  one aspect ratio.this happens all the time.so take your pick<br />  ,
B0071XO8RA|5.0|So, I've just finished the book and I have enjoyed it greatly. It is a great science fiction novel, somehow reminds me of the Fallout, but in books :)<br /><br />I'm rating the book 5 stars without a doubt, although I had...  uhm... two and a half issues with the saga.<br /><br />SPOILERS BELOW<br />----<br /><br />1) When Jules used a suit to go underwater, the air supply was cut off and yet the pressure of being underwater did not crush her. It was a pretty bad chapter and honestly I did not enjoy it. I am not greatly educated in stuff like that, but even with the limited knowledge in this area I know, that the constant air supply is not only meant to deliver oxygen to the diver, but also to compensate the pressure differences. In other words, she would die in seconds if the air supply was cut off.<br /><br />2) The children in Silo 17. How could they still be children if the Silo were wiped ~30 years ago? I can pretend, that there were parents still trying to repopulate the silo, but it would've been nice to receive some explanations on that matter. And the baby? Who's baby is that?<br /><br />2.5) Sometimes the style of writing bothered me. Overall I found it great, but sometimes the metaphors are just too much. They meant to decorate the text, not to crowd it with themselves. Besides, some metaphors are just waaay to cheesy, i.e. about the empty bed or dead pixels which die one by one (both in the 1st book).<br /><br />Other than that, enjoyed the book greatly, thank you.<br />And I hope you DO read all your reviews, like you wrote in Q&A part ;)
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|free game added to kindle over Christmas - has been deleted - alredy had it and was added again. thanks

0385535139|5.0|This book lives up to John Grisham's reputation.  He is so aware of the lawyer world and how very crooked they can be and also, there are some good ones out there.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Great movie. I dont normally care for Shia Lbouf but I really liked him in this movie he seems to have grown up and he proved it in this movie
B008QTVNUI|5.0|If you like thrillers, you will love this series.  Excellent performance by Danes.  The mental health angle is definitely an unusual twist.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A must read  for all women!!!!  Very descriptive, detailed, funny! Witty! Visual,  And very very entertaining!!!  Absolutely loved it! ...
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is a very timely matter and every adult should see it.  Very well presented.  It describes how easy it is to fall into the ways of the worlds even when a person is good or a Christian.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This was a gift for a teenage boy who has everything.  I thought giving him another gift card would probably be very dissapointing for him.  This made for a very happy car trip to visit grandparents.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Les Mis is a wonderful book full of history, drama, heartbreak, redemption, love, and sacrifice. It is a chance to see up close a period of history that is not often covered in literature, the continuing French Revolution.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|A very entertaining and moving story about the love and kindness of people who care about their fellow man. Wonderfully acted and presented.
0321701763|5.0|Best book ever, it also came with an instructional DVD and it was used, by for the best purchase I made.
B009B0L324|5.0|This is AC/DC's better album collections, it provides the earlier music along with the most modern/current releases. I love this album and I will never get tired of listening to it.
B0019IB0II|4.0|It was interesting to get new insight,then got a little repetitive. Useful if you know someone who has experience a stroke.
0307346617|5.0|I am easily scared and hate zombie stuff because they are so dang frightening- whether it's Walking Dead or I Am Legend (which I still can't wipe the image of those zombies huddled in a corner in the movie from my brain) and forget the original Romero flicks- no way!<br /><br />These zombies that Brooks created are slow moving and you might just survive if you don't get overrun since millions of the world's population are now zombies, good luck with that. Plus the story and the epidemic/pandemic nature of the virus is not so far from the truth (after reading non-fiction books like Hot Zone & Demon In the Freezer by R. Preston and working in the hospital setting for years). If you take the zombies out, Brooks' scenarios for how the nasty stuff spreads is not unrealistic at all and is rather scarier and more sobering than all the zombies in the world. The social commentary underneath it all is similar to my own world view and I identified with it.<br /><br />The book was written in an interview/oral history format. I found it absolutely riveting.  The author did his research and I found myself looking up from the read and trying to sort out what is real history vs this- amazing detail! The characters came to life (not reanimation- ha) before my eyes. I teared up a couple of times (imagine that a zombie book would illicit an emotional response other than terror and revulsion!). When I finished it, I wanted to read it again, but I had to hand it over to who originally purchased for :-) as soon as he's done, I'll probably read it again. I read the Survival Guide by the same author right after I finished this- it's not as campy & silly as I first thought now that I read WWZ.<br /><br />A word of caution- I read the book and got excited because the movie is supposed to be out this summer. I watched the previews against my better judgement (scared me) and as usual, Hollywood is only using the book as a jumping off point or a story idea- the preview did not match my mental vision at all- oh well, I'm sure my husband and all you who like scary zombie movies will love it, I might just stay home and re-read the book- it's just that good!
B009GESJH2|5.0|I like this album although it is a diffferent kind of music than what I normally listen to. It is a lot bluesy/country inspired but I can listen to it and like it.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Gillian Flynn is an awesome writer and I could not put this book down.  This is the second of her books which I have read, and<br />she is incredible with her writing.
B004FEL6GO|4.0|I know the packaging age recommends this is for older children, however this usually isn't a issue for us. We got this and others as Xmas gifts for our Transformers-obsessed 3 yr old (soon to be 4 in April). What a surprise Xmas morning when after opening, he runs to us for help- both my husband and I were barely able to transform Bumblebee or most of the others with the detailed instructions that comes with each (had a couple of almost toy throwing, similar to controller throwing moments). Doesn't matter if it's a little challenging, we figured it out eventually and the Bee and his Mech brethren are TOTALLY AWESOME- our son plays with them for hours. This particular purchase is for my husband, who has mastered Bee and wanted one for his desk at work to puzzle out while he was on the phone. This is a worthwhile purchase if you have the patience to keep working at it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I was looking for a book after reading the shades and I wanted to continue with a good book and this is it
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a great book and a good ending to an amazing trilogy. Would recommend reading this and the other Hunger Games books.
B007M45PMU|4.0|Good tunes, really catchy. Love that some old soul is coming back. Reminds me a bit of Elton John's Tumbleweed Connection.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great pass time. The graphics are really great and there's always something to do.It's not kiddy in the least bit, but be warned it may become addictive :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is a fun game and is challenging and a great way to kill time especially during class. I reccocmend it
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Love being able to see my battery life right on the screen. So easy, just plug in your power cord and app comes up automatically. Thank you.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is amazing. Addictive and fun you will find it hard to put down. I highly recommend this game for you
B00B2V66VS|5.0|smooth game, way better than the first one. The graphics look amazing and the gameplay is refreshing. I love it!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. IT is very addictive and I am hooked. Practice for the quarter machine!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|A great and adventure filled book with lots of action. Even had a love story in it and some humor.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Good album, not a huge fan of music but like this guy, a couple of the songs are whack but most the majority are good.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|Good product, usefull!!! Buy it if you are looking for quality to your life; soft and easy to use it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is a wonderful tool for me to keep up with all of my grandchildren! they are scattered all over  the U. S.!
B008GAXUGW|5.0|Boccherini is not \\"classical\\" in the sense that Mozart or Haydn are. His style combines a lot of the elegance and vitality of the classical composers (of whom he was a contemporary) with his own unique charm (unlike composers in Italy, Austria, and Germany, Boccherini remained largely uninfluenced by the Viennese school of thought), while still retaining some of the formality and stateliness of the baroque (which is not too surprising as he was born in 1744, six years before Bach's death and the end of the baroque period).<br /><br />While this \\"Complete Boccherini\\" is, in actuality, far from complete (other reviewers have gone into further detail regarding what is missing), it gives us an exceptional and rounded view of the composer's output. By far my favorite discs are those containing his Symphonies, which are majestic and stately but simultaneously light and sweet. Boccherini's forte is certainly fantastic string writing, especially for his own instrument - the cello -, but he is equally at home writing for other instruments.<br /><br />The recordings themselves are generally very good, which most of the licensed music being from digital recordings in the 1990s. Perhaps budget was an issue, or perhaps there just weren't enough recordings to be consistent, but I would really have loved to have seen Tafelmusik recordings which are, in my personal opinion, just ever so slightly better in that they sound a little brighter.<br /><br />However, at under $2 per disc, there is really nothing to complain about: for the price, it's an amazing collection. And, if you're a fan of Boccherini - or, like me, you've heard a few pieces in the past and wanted to hear more -, then this is absolutely the best option for getting a lot of bang for your buck.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app has great graphics. It allows you to have your own horse to groom,take care of and compete with. This is a must have game. The best part is....its FREE!!!

140120306X|4.0|Black Dossier, while not the best of the LoEG series at all, is an amazing exercise in form.  Moore uses the form of the dossier to explore the myriad ways that graphics and story can work together to produce a narrative.  The result is uneven: as a story, it doesn't come together with nearly the same vigor as the previous two volumes of the League.  However, as stand alones, each section is pretty amazing, culminating in a 3D comic that kind of blows the mind.
0312945973|5.0|I read this book approximately 18 years ago, borrowed from a friend. I recently decided to search for it so I could read it again such was the impression it left on me all those year ago,I found it on Amazon after a bit of searching and it was just as good as it was originally so much so that i then went on and purchased the seventh scroll which was equally as good.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|You don't need to spend the extra money for the OFFICIAL Kindle cover; this one is perfect - and I love purple!!
B008AK8FHM|1.0|There was only one reason to publish this book; to make money.  There was NO PROOF and the author was just using a bunch technical  words the reader would not understand to impress the reader.  He probably used a medical thesaurus at his side when writing it.  His specialty as a neurologist does not separate him from other MDs.  Unless a patient has been declared brain dead, they are still alive and... in a coma, this is called dreaming.  A six-day coma is not unusual for an injury, giving the body a chance to heal.  In the last year, this was absolutely the WORST book I've read and was certainly not worth $8.94 I spent for the Kindle copy.  Shame!
B006OCM0G0|1.0|Kindle Fire users are NOT fully supported by Teamlava - the makers of restuarant story.  So, Kindle Fire owners do not get the updates that other players receive.  Now, if you don't care about getting holiday content- then the game is pretty fun, and I would recommend it.  But, personally, I want the updates.  Kindle users did not receive the Christmas update, and we have not received the Valentine's Day update.  When you don't get the updates, you don't have access to new goals, recipes, and decorations that other players have.  Teamlava has basically told us that this is because they do not have enough resources.  But, they will definitely take Kindle Fire player's $$ if you elect to purchase things in-game.  So, they want your $$, but they do not want to dedicate resources to ensure that you have the updates that other players have.  I just find this to be completely unacceptable.  Teamlava needs to fix this before offering this game to Kindle Fire players.<br /><br />I think the worst part about this is that when Kindle players posted multiple questions on Teamlava's forum about receiving the new content, the Teamlava staff and moderators either deleted the posts or did not answer the questions.  This went on for over a month.  Finally, this week, Teamlava responded, and this is when they told us that they do not have enough resources to ensure that we get the new holiday content.  When asked why they had been avoiding answering the question and deleting posts for so long, their answer was that they did not have any information (makes no sense when the actual answer about not having enough resources was pretty straight foward...I can't believe it took them a month to figure that out.)  So, Teamlava staff stated that one way they might be able to fix this was to create a Holiday gift box to offer Kindle Fire players.  The gift boxes cost real $$!!  Why in the world would we pay real $$ for something that other players are getting for free??<br /><br />I play Dragonvale - can you imagine Dragonvale releasing a new dragon, but not for Kindle Fire?  They just wouldn't do it, because they value their Kindle Fire players just as much as their other players.  Teamlava just doesn't get it.  I would avoid this game until Teamlava decides they want Kindle Fire player's business and they are willing to fully support us in return.  I deleted the game from my Kindle Fire.<br /><br />So - the short version is: The good: The game is fun, and I like the social networking part of it.  The bad: It is frustrating to not receive the updates and content that other players are getting.  The ugly: Teamlava has treated Kindle Fire users really poorly.  They should be ashamed.
B007BFSYMS|1.0|I cannot rate this app because it failed to download to my Android phone. I tried repeatedly to download it and while the website shows I &#34;purchased&#34; it, it is nowhere on my phone.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|If you want a treat, get this version of the story that he used in his live readings. His margin notations are a look into his mind.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Wow, I was NOT disappointed, what a stunning game, metaphysical, emotional, tells a good story without being \\"preachy\\".  I would definitely recommend to anyone wanting a totally different kind of gaming experience.  It is true it is short (only 2 - 3 hours tops) but I have already played it 3 times and will probably play it another 2 by tomorrow.  There is even a trophy you can win for \\"meditating\\" on the game for a week then playing it again, obviously this game is meant to share some deeper thoughts with us earthilings.<br /><br />Will share with my children and grand-children, it's that good!!<br /><br />P.S.  I love that at the end of the game they let you know the screen names of who you worked with, I was surprised at times that I had worked with 7 - 8 people when I thought I had only worked with 4 or 5.
B000P0J06K|3.0|But when I received the package as soon as I opened the envelope you can tell the piece that holds the movie in place broke so it was not package well. Since it was a gift I didn't have time to return it or complain. I just hoped for the best that it wasn't scratched too badly n played well.
0316069434|4.0|The Rodney King verdict and the subsequent riots in LA are often mentioned in Connelly's Bosch series. This book begins with a flashback to one of the 3 nights of riots when Bosch was a detective investigating deaths that occurred during the carnage. A female photojournalist is found dead in an alley, discovered by National Guard soldiers assigned to restoring peace. Because of the circumstances they find themselves in, Bosch and his partner are forced to move on to the next death scene and aren't able to give this one the time and effort it deserves. Bosch feels bad about this, but has no choice but to move on. Flash forward 20 years later, and Bosch is on the Cold Case squad when a hit comes up in this case. If anyone is going to stick with a case til the end, we know it's Harry. And he doesn't disappoint. This story is gritty, hard hitting, uplifting and a little melancholy at the same time. We also get a glimpse into the evolving relationship Harry has with his sixteen year old daughter, Maddie. Also, love interest Hannah Stone appears and we are updated on the state of that relationship.
B0099116AY|5.0|The plot is very believable.  The acting is great.  Makes you think about what can happen to couples that don't communicate.
B0086700CM|5.0|A very good fun app full of action! Would recommend it to everyone! Get it and you will see the fun that you can have!
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|As much as I love to look at Colin, Kate Beckinsale's lack of acting ability ruined this movie. The remake had some interesting ideas and the had potential to be an enjoyable, mindless action film, but Kate's constant presence really ruined it.
B0009A40ES|5.0|If you love slashers this is an awesome one from way earlier in Christian Bale's career. Back when he was doing more risque, lower budget stuff. Everything about this movie is well planned and performed. Very rich, very New York.
B002N57KG2|4.0|A movie to keep your attention and keep you wondering what will happen next.  You really don't know who is in the race untill it gets going.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This case is basically perfect. The more I use it the more I like it. Fits my iPhone 4s like a glove and looks good too. I love the clear design and I even like the circles on the back. It's simple, but gets the job done at under 10 bucks.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I could not finish this book because it was so poorly written. It reads like something an 8th grader wrote.....until the sexy parts of course. Those parts are still poorly written though. The writing in 50 Shades makes The Twilight Series read like Shakespeare.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love being able to find references easily.  Best thing since I had &#34;The Bible&#34; installed on a VERY old computer.
B000E8QVWY|4.0|but the happy ending is soooo boring that it almost spoiled the otherwise good impression. Love the actress, she is a good comedian.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|this game is harder the temple run but it makes it exciting but you have to think fast when playing
B004MOQAU4|3.0|This is not 165 min movie, as description states, this is a 200 minute version without several major scenes. While this still is a great movie, I would prefer a more concentrated version.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Text book history is so easy to read through and forget, when you intertwine it with a more personal touch it hits home harder. My grandfather was a WWII vet and said before he died that our generation needed a war to appreciate what we have... I truly hope that does not happen. The toll war plays on those affected is heartbreaking! This is a long read but remains a very engaging one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this game is really cool and I recommend this for anybody who likes horses as much as I do.

B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like this new game by Imangi Studios. I like it because its fun time waster. Better than Temple Run.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Have purchased 4 episodes so far and haven't had any problems. Thank you amazon for having these episodes available to watch.

B009XHAM8G|1.0|Did not care for this book at all - the premise is somewhat creepy to me. I know many of my friends love reading this to their babes, but it's not for us. :-)

B00A6N7BS0|2.0|The Hollywood ending ruined it. No one believed in their role besides Selma. Blake particularly wasn' t into the story.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|Very detailed life story told fairly.  Enjoyed the precise timelines of business development and changes.  Could hardly put it down.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|A little bit of a learning curve for when to jump and duck for the new obstacles, but then lots of fun. Awesome graphics. Better game play as you build up coins to get the upgrades.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I hope there is more. The story line was fantastic!!! I hope to stumble upon my fifty shades someday!!! E L James you are amazing!!
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Bought this at a great price to add to my Grand daughters Dr. Seuss collection.  funny little movie.  glad I bought it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really like the game and it is super fun. The games are all fun so you people should get it
B008DM4OTA|5.0|It's a simple, fun game persay for kids.  They can take care of patients and give them medicine, clean their ears, take xrays, etc.  It encourages kids to explore the space on their own.  Almost everything in a scene does something whether it's a noise or an actual function.  Not much true learning, but a fun alternative game.  Clean fun for kids.  We got this when it was offered for free.  We're considering purchasing other panda apps.<br /><br />Update: Purchased the full restaurant version and it's a hit just like this one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great!!! Easy I loooovvvveeee it!!! So easy and fun great for younger kids and for adultS game costs no money
B003ITZBVS|5.0|Great Condition, Great Quality, Great Movie. I love this title & I'm happy I bought it. If you're a big Batman fan like me then you should definitely have this movie & buy it from here.
B00005LK94|5.0|I liked the movie and bought it for my grandson who just loves the story. It was a great birthday present
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Absolutely amazing. A great reminder of hope and happiness that we all wish to have throughout our lives. I loved it.

B000001ELR|5.0|I was wary of this album.  To me, Kiss always consisted of Paul Stanley, Gene Simmons, Ace Frehley and Peter Criss.  Chronologically, this album follows the unmitigated disaster that was \\"Music From The Eder\\", the first album not to feature Peter Criss on drums (he had been kicked out of the band for his problems with substance abuse).  \\"Elder\\" was so bad that Ace actually left Kiss entirely, feeling that the band was spent.  Only with pleading by Paul and Gene did Ace allow his face and name to be used on this new album, \\"Creatures of the Night.\\"  But make no mistake, new member Eric Carr definitely steps up the drumming and the then-unmentioned guitarist (Vinnie Vincent) fills in nicely the space that Ace once occupied.  The album more than hints at the pre-Dynasty albums, with a sound more akin to the harder, earliest albums such as \\"Hotter Than Hell\\" and \\"Kiss.\\"  There is not a bad song on the disc, and it is more than worthy of any Kiss fan's collection.  In my opinion, this is the best Kiss album until \\"Revenge\\", and stands as the last of the \\"masked era\\" albums (until Kiss went back into makeup with Ace and Peter on \\"Psycho Circus\\" and subsequent albums).
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I am sorry to run out of levels and hope they expand it soon (or come out with the next version).
B000001ELL|4.0|This is sort of a strange album for Kiss.  Following the success of the solo albums and &#34;Alive II&#34; Kiss was one of the biggest bands in the world.  But even the biggest band cannot live in a vacuum; by 1978 Disco was in full swing, and Kiss sought to take advantage of this by releasing &#34;Dynasty.&#34;  Several of the tracks on this disc have a very Disco feel to them, particularly the intro track &#34;I Was Made For Loving You.&#34;  Sadly, this foray into more modern music signaled a decline of sorts for Kiss, as their popularity waned somewhat from here on out.  That's not to say &#34;Dynasty&#34; is not a worthy Kiss album, just not one of their best.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Sometimes slow to load but very enjoyable! I already want to buy more tack...hope to jump bigger courses in higher levels. Fun!
B001UREJWM|5.0|As an on and off again member of Black Sabbath, Ronnie James Dio earned a place in Sabbath lore second only to original singer Ozzy Osbourne.  During the later years of the 2000s, Dio once again joined forces with Sabbath bandmates Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler and former Sabbath and Dio drummer Vinny Appice to tour under the name \\"Heaven and Hell\\" to differentiate themselves from the Ozzy-led lineup of Black Sabbath which had toured earlier.  They even managed to write enough material for a new album, released under the \\"Heaven and Hell\\" moniker instead of \\"Black Sabbath.\\"  And it is fortunate for all of us that they did; Ronnie James Dio would soon be diagnosed with stomach cancer, the disease that ended his life at age 67.<br />That said, \\"The Devil You Know\\" is probably the hardest album Black Sabbath/Heaven and Hell ever recorded.  Every track oozes with Iommi and Butler's signature dark riffs, while Dio's operatic voice and Appice's eerily accentuated percussion work complete this, the last album ever to feature Ronnie James Dio.  There are no bad tracks on the CD.  Period.  My personal favorites are \\"Atom and Evil,\\" \\"Bible Black,\\" \\"Follow The Tears,\\" and \\"Breaking Into Heaven.\\"  If even only a casual fan of Sabbath or Dio, this album must be a part of your collection; for a hardcore fan of either band, it is a sin to be without it.<br /><br />As an update, when \\"13\\" came out, I was initially slightly disappointed as to how the album stacked up against \\"The Devil You Know\\".  While my opinion of \\"13\\" has improved with time, I still prefer \\"The Devil You Know\\" for its heavier bass and Vinny Appice's drum work.  Ozzy's voice is spot-on, but I guess I'll always prefer Ronnie's operatic style.  Either way, however, if \\"13\\" is Sabbath's last album, I can die happy knowing that both of Sabbath's most loved singers knocked one out of the park at the end.  But I'll still prefer \\"The Devil You Know\\".  It just never gets old.
B003B02O14|5.0|wow - what a page turner!!!! highly recommend.  grishmam at his best.  i don't know how he keeps coming up with such great material.
B009329Y30|5.0|This movie was purchased as a gift. I have not viewed it but rating is for service and value. Star rating should be sufficient feed-back.
B007N85POS|5.0|Good skill level. Multiple difficulty levels. Angry Birds Rio is as good as any other mutiple level Angry Bird games. Keeps me entertained
B003JTHXOK|1.0|Just terrible. Oversimplified language on the level of elementary school. Will never buy his books again. It is a total waste of money.
B00AYB0SX4|2.0|boring slow and predictable,fell asleep several times,wish i had saved my money. would not recommend. wait until it is on prime
B007N8RULO|5.0|I really enjoy this game, great addition to the classic solitaire, but like most people I find myself playing it more and more
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's pretty good.  Takes a while to get enough coins or gems to do anything. And the activities take too long to be ready
B00B2V66VS|5.0|omega great game although when u first get it it skips a lot u de all the time. Also when u go to jump duck or turn sometimes it doesent let u
B000E1MTYU|5.0|This is a great movie. I have always loved the terminator franchise, and this one delivers the goods. Would highly recommend this movie.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This very helpful, very well-thought-out app should be one of the first ones you put on your android device.  I'm using it on my Kindle Fire HD, because I wanted to always have an idea of the condition of its battery.  I personally think this app should come already installed on the Kindle, because the little idiot light on the dashboard that passes for a battery meter is simply not enough of a warning or help to the user.  Thanks smallte.ch for filling the gap!
B004NELBPC|4.0|I love readig the Huffington Post and especially on my kindle. it is easy to navigate and read. definitely one to download!!!
014241543X|3.0|This week I purchased If I Stay, by Gayle Forman, on my Kindle. It was only $2.99 and I figured I could spare a few dollars to check it out.<br /><br />If I Stay was an easy read. It is a Young Adult novel and I believe it would be good for anyone over 14. I was really impressed with some of the vocabulary used in the book. I think a few YA readers may even have to open up a dictionary and look a couple words up.<br /><br />It's hard reading a Kindle book sometimes because it usually doesn't have page numbers, but this one did, which was great. I like to know what page I'm on and how many I have left.<br /><br />The novel is set in Oregon, not far from Portland, in the winter of Mia's senior year of high school. Mia is a cello prodigy and is waiting for her acceptance letter to Julliard.  She has a wonderful family which includes: a brother who is in second grade and parents who love rock and roll.  Her boyfriend, Adam, loves her unconditionally and is just starting a tour with his band who has recently become popular.<br /><br />The story starts off on a rare snow day in Oregon. The family decides to take a road trip to visit some friends and family because they have a free day to spend however they please. Before they can make it to their first destination, a devastating car accident occurs. Mia is now stuck in-between life and death trying to figure out how to choose between what she has lost and what is left for her to live for.<br /><br />If I Stay jumps from present day and  stories from Mia's past, every few pages. You quickly learn that Mia has a hard choice to make, to stay or to go, but in reality, is it her choice to really make?<br /><br />Although this book is on the serious side , Mia adds a sense of humor to it that will make you laugh, at least it made me laugh. Her outer body experiences seem real and reminded of the One Tree Hill episode where Clay was recovering from a gun shot wound.<br /><br />I found this book to be interesting. I read it fairly fast, which means it was good enough to hold my attention, but I hated the ending. All of a sudden it was just over, and it's not like I didn't want it to end, because I kind of did, but I was left feeling like there was so much more to be said. It's as if the author got bored of writing and she was like, \\"Eh, I can just end it here, no one will notice.\\" Well, I noticed, and I want more.<br /><br />this review was originally posted on my blog.y fast, which means it was good enough to hold my attention, but I hated the ending.

B00AFWEPVI|2.0|first off all, its hard to take a picture when you can't see what you're taking a picture of!!! Also, there's no flash. I was expecting more since the camera was supposed to be the wonderful new feature
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The app crashes and when I try to reopen it it only says imangi studios then closes! Please fix! I have to keep redownloading and it keeps doing the same thing! Help me out please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Such a helpful book. It is worth reading to help your own relationship and your friends. Explains all kinds of love and how to understand it
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I liked the beginning of the book with the way the author developed her characters but once she starts in on the repeated descriptions of sex, sex and the lead female climaxing at the drop of a hat it becomes tedious to read. I put it down for several months before I finally picked it up and finished the book. The ending was good enough to get me to buy the second book.
B00866H7SS|5.0|Loved it! Brilliant. Get the series and settle in for the weekend, lock the door and turn off the phone! You won't put it down!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|You can only describe sex so many times and this book gets old fast. At the beginning I liked the character development but found that the sexual theme is relied upon too much.  The writer seems to have a juvenile approach to writing her books.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Brilliant book, worth reading, remember the girl is only young and therefore a bit pathetic and then go with it. Great fun
0385344333|2.0|I certainly hope that Reacher..the real Reacher..shows up soon. This was one of the most boring audiobooks I have ever listened to (and paid for). Hours of driving????<br /><br />I have all of the Reacher books, most on CD and I have to say that I couldn't wait for the end of this one. Makes me nervous about paying about $30.00 for the next one.
B004XZR63M|4.0|Worth reading, give it to your kids to read, wish I'd have read this as a teen, hike recommend it to all
B000VE439Y|4.0|In their usual comical way of mocking different groups, organizations, etc, religion is no different. While some people may find the movie offensive it was funny and enjoyable.
B004KA9VGA|5.0|Brilliant story, so well written, I was on the edge of my seat. Get a cuppa settle In And keep reading!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Great book!  It is a little hard to get into at first, but after the first 50 pages or so, I couldn't put it down.  Awesome story and great descriptions.  I loved it!
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Loved it loved it loved it! Highly recommend it. Worth staying up late to read, get the series and settle in for the weekend!
0399224459|5.0|My grandson loved it as a little one and we gave it as a gift to a new mom to read to her son..
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A show that makes you think a bit...doesn't spell every detail out for you and keeps things moving right along.  Fun to watch and get to know all the characters.
B000MX7V5M|4.0|There is only one thing I don't like about this move and never have.  The &#34;fireworks&#34; that explode as Grant and Kelly &#34;make sparks&#34;.  :)  They special effects fireworks have always grated - even when watching this as a child.  I guess Hitch had special effects limitations - but they look cheap and nasty in comparison with the rest of the movie.  I even don't mind the obviously dubbed French actor, whose English it appears was unintelligible in his scenes. I just wish someone would do something about those damn fireworks!<br />Action, suspense, pretty scenery, Cary Grant, Grace Kelly - a good movie for a lazy weekend.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I downloaded it and loved it untill all the sudden it wouldn't open. tried to redownload and it failed. I was very disappointed.
B0034G4OXQ|1.0|I can see the inspiration for Clint's talking to an empty chair after enduring this movie which has no substance.  It's a movie that needed a better script and in my version at least - the english subtitles stopped working in the french scenes early on and refused to turn back on - so those scenes were so much \\"gibberish\\" to me.<br />Save your money - read a good book instead.
B00000K3D4|5.0|This was a gift that was well received by a Bowie fanatic. It came in great condition and we have no complaints.
B009VA1FN6|3.0|The Secret Keeper....I found the book hard to get into but really enjoyed the second half.  Well constructed mystery but I did not find the beginning believable.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|It will not load and it is hard for me to say I like this app.<br />But maybe that is just for me and not everyone else
B001P06GX4|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and we play it all of the time.  My son joins us sometimes as well.  It is a simple premise, to fit all of your diversely shaped pieces onto the board while blocking opportunities for other players, but it involves thinking ahead and strategizing.  It is easy to learn, and all ages can play, although the younger players will probably just enjoy placing their pieces, without thinking ahead as much.  It is a game we play every week, and I recommend it highly.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|&#34;Defending Jacob&#34; is not the run-of the-mill mystery.  The author grabs your attention from the first page. Each chapter draws you further and further into the drama unfolding for a normal family, loved by everyone in their community, who suddenly find themselves in the newspaper headlines because of their 14 year old son. I will not disclose any more details because I don't want to ruin this book for you. Read it !  You will find yourself staying up later and looking at your teenager differently. Leave it to Amazon to change your life!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Good but ending blew I wanted them to stay together but I guess not boo maybe the next one they will
B00A757EFW|3.0|Not really holds my interest the kids love it. So I let them play sometimes.<br />My kids are adults and played this years ago.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game and its very entertaining. but I just wish it was a lot easier to get money.. and easier to buy tack and stuff.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|It is helpful in finding what I am looking for. I do a lot of research. Like my kindle very much!
B000I9YXKG|5.0|This movie is funny, sad, utterly charming. Love Audrey Hepburn!<br />A story of the changes that occur, naturally in marriages- even those not in the south of France.
B004ZZS4CC|2.0|Sad story, and Jaycee certainly spares no detail. It is poorly written, a lot of fragments. Disappointing to say the least. I wish I could get my money back!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow!  What an awesome book. Dean and Sky are amazing, strong characters.  This was by far the best first everything all wrapped up in one powerful story.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Good app add me F/12 cute boys with swag add me 12-14 only a body over that will be blocked I mean that nobody over 14 ! Thanks my kik : kimkim01
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Wow!  A wonderful book.  I hate I have finished.  I have found my new favorite author and have to read more of Jodi Picoult.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Das Spiel macht eigentlich viel Spaß und bietet eine Menge Möglichkeiten. Einziges Manko meiner Meinung nach, daß man um Pferde zu kaufen die Edelsteine braucht. Diese muß man für reales Geld kaufen. Im Spiel selbst bekommt man zu wenig,was ich sehr schade finde, da es ansonsten wirklich gut ist.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I taught my elderly mother this game to keep her mind stimulated. she loves it! The color and clarity of the board make it easy for her to see and challenge her.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Very sensual.  Surprised by the age of the main character.  Initially upset because it seemed like a teenage romance story.  Excellent expression of consequences of sexual abuse/incest.  Quite suspenseful.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I downloaded this game for my 6 year old grandson but ended up playing it myself.  Once we figured out the you need to cover the stars with the pudding monster the game made sense and became fun.  Some of the levels were super easy and some were very challenging.  The more challenging levels test you sense of logic and how to do things in a certain order to reach your goal.  Even if it were not free game I'd give it 5 starts.  The graphics were good and it was fun.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|It was a very good story,  but David could have gotten to the end sooner!  That being said, I do like reading his books.  I hope he brings Will Robie back.
B008FTAAG2|3.0|You can tell they idolize Kitty and Flyleaf. If you combined them (30% Kitty and 70% Flyleaf) In This Moment is what you would end up with. Every song comes in 1 of 2 sounds: lame or slighty forced anger. The album's best moments are due to skilled studio mixing, but it does have it's moments. Why is it so hard to find genuine aggresiveness and originality in a female band? I guess Otep won't be loosing it's crown any time soon.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I have only used it once so far but I like the assortment of sounds and alarms. It took a little while to figure out how to use it. One suggestion would be to allow mixing the sounds.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|Gave this as a gift for Christmas - really don't know what the person thought about it, but I am sure it will be OK&#62;
B000N2HBSO|4.0|I cannot truly rate this book because I have not finished it yet.  I am reading it more for education than pleasure and I find myself having to go back and reread whole chapters in order to understand the politics involved here.  There are so many characters mentioned that I have found it helpful to write short biographical notes on the different people mentioned and oftentimes refer back to my notes to refresh my memory on how they fit into the picture.  I cannot read this and absorb any of it if I am tired or preoccupied  I saw the movie which piqued my interest in the history of that era.
B007N8RULO|4.0|It is ok. I like it and play every now and then. I wish the cards were bigger, it would be more fun
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read some of the review. Maybe the book should say it has abuse in it. However, I loved every bite. I mean really, fifty shades, bared to you, and I can go on and on and they all are sexually abuse.<br /><br />Yes, it is so hard to read about what happened with Hope, and Les but there is so much love in this story. I makes you feel love Karen has for Sky. The love these to teens have for one another. I loved this book, very well written. Thank you Coleen.
B008AWBQIU|5.0|Arrived promptly and in condition as stated! Good greatest hits for a heavy metal band. Has most of their greatest hits so far!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I had a lot of fun with this game. The graphics are wonderful and the storyline sucks you in. Was worth the money. More fun when set in expert mode.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|I have no clue &#34;how&#34; this game works but my 5 year old figured it out in a couple hours and has been playing it now (weeks later) all the time. She loves taking care of the pets (washing/feeding) and accruing points to trade for new houses or fun equipment for them to use. It's cute that every pet has it's story and she thinks each one that she un-locks is cuter than the last. I asked her what she likes best about the game and her response was &#34;I love it - all of it and the best part is winning a new pet&#34;.
B00AKO93JK|1.0|I have repeatedly tried to get this app to work,but all I get is a black soundness screen where the workout should be. Very disappointing.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|WOW ONCE YOU START YOU CANT PUT IT DOWN! MY HUSBAND IS GETTING A BIT JEALOUS! HE HE HE! LOVE IT!
B00AVPYT8I|1.0|As other reviewers noted, what you click is not likely what you will get. I never was able to get \\"Safety & First Aid\\" despite nearly 20 attempts. What I did get was nearly every other category in \\"Health, Mind & Body\\". The categories looked great. If they could fix this rather serious issue, this would be a great app. Currently, this app is extremely unreliable and frustrating. For sanity's sake, avoid this app.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is actually lots of fun, but I would like  if they made it easier to get gems though that's why I put it as four star.
B00008973A|5.0|Good movie, lots of memories and was great to see again.  Would make a great gift for anyone out there who enjoys musicals.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this game is wonder ful I love to play it every day why you ask because it's so fun and it's 3d awesome right
B000I0QL82|5.0|I really love this movie and it just wouldn't be Christmas without a viewing.  I don't like having to wait for TV.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|I love it. it feels like I'm taking care of a real horse!!! such lovable creatures. It reminds me of another horse game I had once; but it wasn't really that great.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I definitely needed to own my own copy.  I like to watch it whenever I need a Christmas pick-me-up. Enjoy!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|this is very amazing. nothing  like  first addition.... so  you can watch this without watching first.  dark, but smart story.
B000NA28I4|2.0|I read the book and was disappointed with the movie.  So much more could have been done.  Boring, long and dull.  Would not recommend this movie.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I play it all the time it.s a fun game I think a lot od people should check it out
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This is a must see. A real eye opener on the food industry. It definitely makes you want to reconsider what you pull off the shelf when you're shopping.
B004UID2LC|5.0|this works great i can get any song i want from youtube, but the cover art isnt the same it is usally the cover art of the last song that you were lisening to
B009JZTOG8|4.0|So many twists in turns in the plot and subplots. This production is well done- well acted, well written and well produced.
B008OOYALE|3.0|When I was playing on Dragon Story the screen blacked out and I couldn't find anything and I couldn't find my Dragon nests
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|Not really my kind of game.  Most kids would like this but it got boring for me after the first few times.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|The cover photo hints at the supernatural,  and the book won't disappoint; just don't expect a ghost story. Like Steven King's From A Buick 8, this tale is far more a mature read, asking the reader to challenge the preconceived notion of the text based on the cover or some childish expectation of what YA lit offers.<br /><br />A thouroughly engaging read, stylistically well-written, will engage both those looking for action but filled with an enjoyable character development, as well as tinged with hints of romance.<br /><br />Definitetly worth the time spent. Looking forward to next \\"peculiar\\" chapter.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game has gotten hold of me.  I have played all but 200 of the total boards and it can keep my mind engaged for a long time.  Like Sudoku, it keeps my mind sharp.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This was one of the worst books I've ever read.  It's totally unrealistic and so NOT SEXY!  The dude is a total FREAK!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I would give Downton Abbey 5 stars but I am very upset that Amazon is now charging Prime Members to download Season 3 Episodes. Seems a bit greedy since there was no charge for the previous seasons. Now that the show is a hit, Amazon seems to be trying to reap the rewards. While $2 isn't much, it is just the principal of it. I wasn't going to pay it but was unable to download properly through PBS website and am hooked on the show! Now that I'm caught up I will just watch the weekly program.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Never thought I would like a book about hiking, but to my surprise I couldn't put &#34;Wild&#34; down.  Loved the way the author wrote.  Cried when she talked about her mother dying and killing the horse.  Great book.  I have recommended it everyone I know.  Great story of discovery and redemeption.
B0053IOZBE|5.0|This series never gets old. A favorite for both teenagers and parents. The realistic life dramas that unfold from the characters are believable and hit home with all ages.  Experiences everyone has either dealt with or know of someone who has.  It's a clean, funny series for tweens and older.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Utterly mind blowing acts of gallantry, chivalry, compassion, aggression and ultimately, friendship. Would be an amazing work of fiction if it wasn't a true story. Get this, share this and never forget what a generation of heroes these men were.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game had me playing for hours. It is incredibly fun, and a good way to burn time. It has interesting new features like a zip line, coal  mine, and different obstacles. I highly recommend you get this game.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Really useful little app. Look at every time I turn my Kindle fire HD on.  If you have to monitor your battery this is the best way to do it.  Recommended.
B0002EXH5O|2.0|Don't buy this version, you're better off with the original.  I don't see how they could've been happy with this but from a fan's point of view, it is never a good idea to remix something that was fine the way it was.  The added demos are a nice plus though.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like to pass the time with this game... funny thing is I don't really even like horses hahaha but I am wan animal lover
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I've been a fan of R. Moody books since early 80's. This is another wonderful validation my spiritual beliefs for the last 30 +/- years.
B008NW67E0|4.0|I really like Mumford. That being said, they do have a habit of producing a sound that they like to repeat over and over again. I don't mind it but some might find it a bit wearing. Check out the songs on youtube before investing. I actually bought this as a gift for a far more diehard fan than I and she was over the moon about it. Overall, it's a great album and makes some wicked paper-writing music.
B0086DBE62|1.0|Why would she do this movie?  What a terrible script, terrible twist on this classic story!  I expected at least some modicum of entertainment here but it was awful!  The attempts at humor were pathetic, the prince was irritating, especially when a \\"puppy love\\" spell was cast on him!  Really?  There was absolutely no reason for this movie to be made.  Also, the end of with the singing was ridiculous... sounded a little like Bollywood?  Utter waste of time.
B009EAO38C|5.0|Ah, the Piano Guys. Youtube sensation and homework time destroyers extraordinaire. Once you start watching their videos on youtube, you just can't stop. You tell yourself you're just putting it on for the music but the videos are so fun and creative that you just can't help yourself.<br /><br />I believe you can preview  all of the songs on this album on youtube, but I highly recommend purchasing the album not just to support the artist but to restore productivity in your life. Once you start listening, you won't be able to stop, if you buy the CD, then at least you can try to work while listening to their energetic renditions of Adele and Beethoven and some of their original compositions. Totally worth the money, it makes me smile every time I pull it up.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|It's easy to use and always helps get my 1 month old daughter to stop crying. I also use this with my 2 year old daughter and it helps her fall asleep faster.
B00A3CVFMM|4.0|I admit it, I'm a sucker for LOTR, and Howard Shore can do no wrong in my mind. The soundtrack is quite enjoyable but very reminiscent of the previous three movies in the franchise. It certainly has it's own strengths and that very recognizable underlying melody that the dwarves establish in Bag End. I think it's a great addition to my collection but I am the fan's fan. If you're just looking for that goose bump raising song, buy the Misty Mountain track. If you're a collector or a music enthusiast like me, go for the whole thing and pig out on the delights of instrumental music.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|pefect cd! My grandson loves Taylor so I bought this cd for him! he loves to dance to her music
B007SY3CEW|5.0|I wanted the fire kindle for reading and going on the internet. I downloaded this app in the first days. I play it and the Mozart piano master every morning. At least an hour.I never realized how much I missed playing the piano, It a great way to learn and I am getting better every day. I love it! I would like to see more Piano apps come along.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a game that i can not put down. this is one of the best games of all time loving it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses but cant afford one.. ;) now I can with this app... its a really fun experience... iv had a horse before but had to give him away..
B0068C9W44|5.0|When it comes to stars like Rihanna, who release an album at least once a year it seems I'm usually skeptical as to their quality.  But this is such a great compilation of songs, I find most of them (if not all) are enjoyable, dance-floor anthems or hits I'll be jamming to for many months.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|it was working great when I first downloaded it on my kindle and now it won't even open. plz fix and it will be a awesome game
B008XG1X18|5.0|this is one of my favorite apps to use. i think i use it  almost everyday! i dont think i have had any issues loading or in use of the app.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|I don't dealt understand it but its an Ok game. I got confused a lot but I like it. it keeps my 4 year old occupied
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|My one star ratting is for the movie it is for amazon instant video. I could only ever get the first 20 seconds of the video to play and most of that was just the add for the company. It may be a great movie, I just couldn't watch it :(
B00785P2QC|5.0|the game has kept my attention but is slowing down now after one day. I love it either way. peace
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Quick, easy read for an afternoon. Slightly predictable, but made me remember how great innocent love can be.  Inspired some romance for me as well.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got this app because people were talking about Minecraft at school. I tried it and I could spend my whole day on just this one app. It's really addicting. I totally recommend this app.
B002N5N5R0|5.0|It is great if you follow the series the sons of anarchy and blu ray is such a great quality
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I like it, my 4 year old loves it to the point she dreams about playing it. She has become an offical &#34;Angry Birds Addict&#34;
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The graphics are incredible. There aren't any glitches. It's so addictive I have to argue with myself to stop playing. It just draws you in and next thing you know you've been playing for over an hour! It's just crazy!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was excellent! I read it in only a couple days because I couldn't put it down. Now I can't wait to see the movie!
B008BYXQJY|3.0|For the past several years, Maroon 5 introduced and continued to keep there unique style of music.<br /><br />However, I am guessing that they wanted to experience different styles, Overexposed is different from their previous albums. Overexposed focuses greatly on pop. It was somewhat dissapointing since Maroon 5 had their unique tone in their music. If songs such as \\"Lucky Strike\\" had a cover by a different singer, I probably could have not tell if it was written by Maroon 5. When the rapping in \\"PAYPHONE\\" started it just made me cringe. Whether you like the rap or not is personal preference; however, I did not expect it from a Maroon 5 song.<br /><br />To be fair there are some songs that still has the Maroon 5 vibe such \\"One More Night\\" and \\"Ladykiller.\\" But for the most it's slightly different. You might like the change, but for me it's taking time to get used to.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|We got it in time for Christmas, it's a great movie - talks about relationships, love, and friendship.  Highly recommended - even my husband enjoyed it!
B0047DVHV2|5.0|Really enjoyed this book, an inside to some of the stories you hear over the years. I think that Keith was pretty brutal in his descriptions of events, but somehow I feel he was still sugar coating things a bit.<br />A frank and pretty open life story. enjoyed it heaps
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is awesome! we love taking care of Beauty &amp; entering competitions :-)<br />looking fwd to many more experiences. this is a great app &amp; game.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|This game is great but i have reported bugs and other problems and nothing has changed. There have been no added updates.  I am unable to view my friends' homes and when i try, the app crashes. I also cannot view my friends list. If i try, the app crashes. When i open the app, it crashes. It takes me 5 or 6 times to actually be able to open the app. Sometimes when I'm playing, the screen will freeze and then the screen will unfreeze but be divided into two and one, one side upside down and the other not. My sister has an iPad with this app on it. She doesn't have any of the problems i have on the kindle version PLUS she has all new ponies, new items, and a snow edition. Why is the kindle app full of so many bugs and lacks ponies and such in the store? Ugh.. great app but so many problems
1451627297|4.0|The whole premise of time travel was well thought out and fascinating in its layers.  I loved the characters and the thoughtful interactions.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|George kills it once again.  But this time it is about all of the characters that you care about.  Hello Daenerys, Mother of Dragons...
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|We enjoy the characters...history....and the fun of Downton Abbey.  Though I haven't received my copy of Season 3 - we are enjoying watching it piece by piece on PBS until our copy has been released!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book was a great, fast-paced read. I would definitely read again and I look forward to reading more of John Green 's books. Relatable characters and a believable story.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|This is a treasure endeavoured by competent and brave producers, who knew it was to expensive to go on forever, but did what they could putting their hearts on it. A luxuriously soap opera located in ancient Rome, mixing factual events with fiction. A veru enjoyable history lesson (for adults only, since the XXX rated way of life of romans was carried on here too).
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|I like this app because it is an app you can free draw on it. I have drawn a lot of things.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I noticed this on the free kindle app of the day section and decided what can a free download hurt?  I was pleasantly surprised.  decent selection of sounds for when you're trying to sleep with a simple to use timer both for shutting off the sounds and use as an alarm clock.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|Fruit ninja is a fun game to slice fruit in, you can also change slicers in. But I don't play it that much.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|If you liked the first you will probably like this one.  There's a few new features that feel like they add a bit of &#34;depth&#34; to the game.  It's a bit harder than the original though mostly because it throws in curving paths and you cant usually see too far ahead.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it. It is so addicting I can never stop playing it you have to get this game. If you get this game and you don't like it then you are crazy because this is a awesome game. Well get this game right now .BEST GAME IN THE WORLD
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Couldn't wait to get to this one.  The author is out of this world.  I'm sure I'll be running for the last book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Those game is really cool and very addicting. You should really get this game oh and the best part is that it's free
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is one of the best Trilogies period.  E L James is awesome.  I look forward to here next book (or movie).
B008M721MS|4.0|just want to have try, and I like it ,it's very  good! it's convenient talking with my good friends !
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The characters are beautifully drawn and engaging and each season distills the changes of the era. Characters either grow willingly or are forced to grow, and the best arks frequently involve characters forced to change, like poor Lord Robert dealing with the consequences of his daughters' adventures. There are moments that are so dear I think about them for days afterwards:  Illustrating the winds of change and one of those distilling moments, Mrs. Hughes purchases and uses a bread toaster. The introduction of that little piece of technology takes Mr. Roberts by (unwelcome) surprise.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Great add on to the rod Stewart series. He is getting better with age and does a great job on this album.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 will work on my kindle fire only if I install it over and over again each time. I can get one good play before it loads up the Imangi Studios symbol and exits back to the kindle home. I love this game but I feel like because I'm playing on kindle I'm not up to par with everyone else's privilege to play.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|A fine story. An exceptional Sandra Bullock. Although the plot has something fron a science fiction, nevertheless it is very interesting.
B006TLFPKO|3.0|But in practice, it still needs a bit of work.  There just doesn't seem to be enough bandwidth (and I have a fast broadband internet connection) to have a smooth even play throughout the movie - there are still areas when it has to pause and then pick back up.  There's also one or two scenes that seem so dark I cannot make out what's going on, regardless of the platform (computer or TV).  But it's nice just be able to decide, &#34;I'd like to watch a movie&#34;, and shaZaam, there you go!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I like the game, which is very neat, but I started playing for twenty minutes and then it will not turn on. And I really want it to work, it seems like a really cool game.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love this game ,but it is a little to slow for me. Definitely it is better than the first.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I love Godfather 1 and 2, not so much 3, but who doesn't?  I jumped at the chance to get all 3 movies in a Blu-ray set.  First just to have all 3 movies together in a blu ray set, but this collection shines with extras.  I devoted a whole night to watching the extras! And if you don't need another set of these movies, then buy this for a family member or friend - maybe someone who has never experienced them.  The violence is tame by today's standards, and the story telling is Coppola at his greatest.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This movie is a great addition to his collection and possibly my new favorite! Great acting and a very fun plot.
B004VOBIE8|3.0|have a kidle fire and am still getting used to using it  thigs are getting better as I use it
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Huge Big Bamg fan so this was a no-brainer!  Highly recommend to anyone.  You don't need to undrstand the science to get the humor!
B007RQ6WCA|3.0|have a kindel fire and am getting used to using it. I am a slow learned but it will help
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|great time waster! really enjoyed the puzzles and story line. really cool for a free game. good price all day long man!
B007NESBK2|5.0|I have been a fan as most of us for many years. I fulfilled a life long dream by seeing her live in Denver on her latest and I hope not her last tour.  It was my first time seeing her.  I have two of her DVDs, but got this latest one. It brought home my experience.  I have seen so many shows from so many groups in my 48 yrs on this planet, different genres.  Nobody comes close.  One of the happiest moments of my life was seeing her.  GET THIS DVD.<br />JL
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is pure genius. With all the upgrades and New downloads, it seems to reflect with real life. ( other than a giant demon monkey chasing after you and flying islands). ITS AWESOME!!!!!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is fun. It cost $3 after the free part, but it is still fun! You should totally play it.
B001LXKIOS|5.0|The first season of Star Trek has the best written episodes ,along with the second year . As a kid I remember watching about the first 6 episodes, later in my teens I was a vivid Fan . If You notice in the first 4 episodes the camera angles an the lighting and the stories are very cool an they were written by some of sci-fi best. One episode called \\" what are little girls made of \\"  involved a Man from Nurse Chapels past, who is hiding something on a planet Kirk talks to one of the imates who name is LETHE, means river of foregoneness  , Ted Cassidy plays a Android an a scary one at that/ Dagger of the Mind episode brings the Enterprise on a routine pick up turns up at a penal colony but  something going on down there. In this episode Spock performs His first mind -meld  . Balance of terror The first time they encounter the Romulans ,  both play like a submarine  tactics against each other until one survives . These are just a few of first season Since HD lost against Bluray, this box set has HD on one side the other standard DVD . One other thing , each disc isn't labeled , so its  hard to hide each disc , but there is fine print on the rim of the disc. Watching this remaster  discs brings a new flair to each episode , no more stock footage of the Enterprise , and she looks lovely as can be. The planets are more defined and detailed , slight added scenes with the shuttle craft such as the episode Galileo Seven , when Spock ignites the fuel as a flare around the planet is awesome looking. The price on these sets are a lot cheaper when I bought mine , Im now thinking Bluray , though nothings wrong with this set , but since I have Netflix , I hardly watch it on DVD. If You haven't witness the remaster sets an are a Fan , the digital enhancement is outstanding its worth buying .
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a very fun and entertaining game. It challenges the mind.<br />It is not difficult at all. Great family game. Everyone will be able to play.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Love being able to access this from my kindle! I travel quite a bit and use this app often to plan how  I pack.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|In my opinion, Pride and the Prejudice is a work of art.<br />From a teens point of view its quite beautiful. That leaves you in tears. Some might say its in a old time theme, but I would like to think the romance in this story is so typical every 2000 kinda day. We live in a world where men and women play the \\"I don't like you card.\\" Even when we have already fallen for that person. Instead of realizing right of the bat they were meant to be. Anyway, if you're looking for a nail biter, empty box of tissues, this is an amazing book. Don't over look it because of the title or date written. It's really a piece of art it's self.
B002ZG98FU|5.0|I love this movie--Rachel McAdams is superb in her role, as is Harrison Ford.  Harrison Ford is in his element as a crotchety News reporter.  It's good clean fun--a light-hearted comedy with great actors and actresses.
0143038095|5.0|an awesome book, especially for immigrants or first gen americans like me. i read it first as a class project, theres a ton of symbolism and metaphors, but you can read it without analysing too :) i got it for my mom, because i knew she'd understand. you dont have to be from china to understand it. its hard to name, you know? too hard to explain just read :)
B002DD67XG|5.0|This album is classic James Taylor, with his smooth, mellow voice singing his best songs.  It's a &#34;must have&#34; for any Taylor fans.
B0093OGBL6|3.0|I just do not understand the basic concept of being an enthusiastic `fan' of anybody (or anything) or the need for aggressive paparazzi and was vaguely interested to discover any logic to the phenomenon. The author is a self-confessed fan of Jackson ... but I still don't understand the rationale.<br />The book is rather long - is not chronological and jumps around so the author tends to be regurgitating the same information over and over...I was skipping sentences, then paragraphs, then pages. There is a consistent tendency for incorrect use of the apostrophe (such as: 1970's and DVD's).<br />There seems to be no doubt that man was unjustly vilified and misunderstood.<br />Any `fan' would probably know all the content in this book - but I did glean some `facts' I did not know previously (about `the trial' for instance), but information on the business side of Jackson would have been more interesting?
B0058YPG1G|5.0|When I first started watching Breaking Bad, it was hard to tell a difference between this series and Weeds.  I say this because they are both about drugs, but after watching all four seasons I now see the difference.  The first season I felt was really slow and boring, but once you get into season two, you cannot stop watching.  The plot is set up greatly.  The episodes will start off with a flashback or a flash forward.  This makes you want to see more because you do not know when you will be able to view this clip.  The storyline makes sense.  A high school science teacher who has a pregnant wife, and has recently found out he has cancer, needs to make some money fast and easily.  When season four hits, Walt is willing to do whatever it takes to keep himself alive.  Thinking about it, who wouldn't try to keep themselves alive?  When you get to the last episode of season four, it leaves you hanging.  You know that the bomb was significant and caused a lot of damage, but it saved Walt and Jesse's lives.  My question is will Jesse ever find out what Walt did?  If he was to figure it out what would happen to their relationship?  Knowing that season five is out there, I want to view it right away.  I suggest this series if anyone is into watching action.  It is never ending and always keeps you hanging.
B004I744AS|5.0|Fast and clean. No adds to bother you!!!<br />No wander why this app has already five stars.<br />Thank you for the quality!
B006LSZECO|1.0|Gone Girl is so painfully slow and boring you just can't get through more than a few chapters before you literally have to start reading a different book.I forced myself to finish it desperately wanting it to have a great ending to make the effort somewhat worthwhile but everytime you think its starting to get good it just disappoints you more.I don't think I would have written a review if there had been any kind of resolution in the ending but I wouldn't want my worst enemy to have to suffer through this book like I did.
B008XG1X18|5.0|i love this app! the pinterest website wasn't easy to use on my kindle fire so i was so excited when i found this app!
B008VBYN80|1.0|messes up my device whenever I open it. it is hard to progress without spending real money. just not worth my time
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|another amazing book by an amazing author, actually can't get enough of his books! the ending leaves slot of questions still, but I guess most books to that, but yeah loved it
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I don't know what it is about this show, but it's gripping. I love all the characters and the hard choices they had to make. I had to stop watching after Ireland (...watchers know what I'm talking about, I just don't want to spoil it for anyone.) Because I was entirely too emotionally invested. I'll pick it back up next season, though.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Much better than the iphone Pinterest app. look forward to using it!  think I can definitely use while at the grocery store for all the recipes I pin. thanks again for providing.
B005NFW0U0|5.0|This show is great. I thought it would be cheesy and dumb and a rip off of Twilight, which I'm not the biggest fan of to begin with. But if Twilight was a series, VD would beat it hands down. All of the characters are necessary and like-able.  Watch it.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Absolutely loved this movie. Fast pacing, interesting plot, and strong acting. Watch this if you enjoyed: In Bruges, The Matrix, Brick.
034580404X|5.0|Good read!! Couldn't stop after one, so i bought the set. Best price i could find worth every penny, i never know where mine are now because someone always reading it or has borrowed it
B00992CF6W|5.0|5 stars comes from my 10, 8 & 5 yr olds. They love minecraft on the computer & even more excited by the app for their kindles. Now I just wish they can create an app like this so they do schoolwork with no hassle!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|the presleep theta wave thing works great. i work on ships oo hearing the sound  of home was impossible before i got this app. works best with high quality bluetooth speakers
B008602KQI|5.0|Very interesting dialog. This movie makes it hard to believe that you were watching for over 2 hours 20 minutes.
B00ABXA1HI|4.0|Splashtop will change the way you use a computer. Not only can you access your files from anywhere (if you upgrade to the paid version), you can also enjoy the power of desktop computing with the convenience of a mobile device. I was thrilled with how well this works with Windows 8 running on my PC, which effectively makes my tablet work like a Windows tablet and a Kindle Fire all in one.<br /><br />I definitely plan to upgrade to the full version for remote access from anywhere, not just the same WiFi network. It's more expensive than most apps, but this is a seriously powerful tool.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This app can keep you preoccuppied for many hours. Very fun challenges through all skill levels. I would reccommend this app.
B006H5120E|5.0|I'm so grateful, guys. This is my daughter's Xmas gift. She loves it, We couldn't believe it when it arrived home, so my girls watched it and enjoyed very much! Nice picture and sound for a classic!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This should be a standard feature on all kindle fire's. Very easy to use. I use this for many quick calculations while traveling.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|It completes the series and shows Bruce Wayne's Human side as well as having a successor. It also sets it up for a new Heroe series.
B008764ZQ4|2.0|These versions of the song do them no justice....not to the original artist or the actors trying to sing them now.  Do not spend your money.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|It is an excellent background for the 'Alien' series of movies as well as the origins of 'The Ship' from the first two Alien Films. It is a MUST HAVE for any Sci-fi Enthusiasts.
6305754969|3.0|The first time I saw this movie was in the theatre.  I spent the whole day there watching it over and over and over again. It's a classic and when I find myself in the mood for a western I curl up and entertain myself with it. Two BIG guys that have such a presence on the screen with lots of humor and fun. They don't make them like this any more. :(
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Lots of fun for my daughter and me- thanks! A few hours and we're looking forward to another game. Very well done, visually appealing and interesting story.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|This is a good refresh for those of us that don't get out much. I usually don't have a problem but this had some tips I forgot. This book was a really quick read and super easy to follow.<br /><br />I recommend this book.
B009X00E18|5.0|It works great!standing case for kindle fire.works just like they said it would. Marwarelightweightmicroshellfolio. It was a little expensive. But I'm glad I got it
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I am so glad knowing that I have books such as this to read and enjoy.  It is such a great book.  The fact that it's free makes it even better.  Huge fan!  Love this copy.  I enjoy everything that is free.  This is a must get!
B008XG1X18|5.0|LIKe it, not sure how it works though, can't figure out how to open it and get the directions yet!
B004L07KWQ|1.0|I can't make a picture and I don't think you should get this app it doesn't do what u thought it does by looking at the picture.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is free isn't it? Sure hope so, that was part of the reason I got the kindle fire. Only problem was it has no directions.
B002PEP4SC|3.0|I throughly love the TV series.  So of course had to at least try reading a Richard Castle book.  However, I found myself stumbling over the character names over and over.  HOwever, the story line was well written and easy to follow.  I'll try another and see if the characters don't gel better.
B007N8RULO|1.0|Didn't order this either sure not playing it.. don't have the time and sure won't pay for it either.Honestlydidn't order, don't care for games!
B000FA5STS|4.0|&#34;Total Control&#34; keeps you in suspense....a page turner.  Once I started reading this book, I had to know &#34;what is next.&#34;
0765325950|1.0|I've been waiting years for the end and even purchased \\"By Grace and Banners Fallen: Prologue to A Memory of Light Jordan, Robert, Sanderson, Brandon\\" on October 6, 2012.  I was ecstatic that it was available on my Kindle and presumed the final version would also be made available on Kindle.  I was disappointed, sad, and felt like I was a victim of bait-n-switch. At the least the Prologue should have mentioned the final version was not going to be available in the same format!  I will NEVER buy another book by Brandon Sanderson.  I will however purchase this one if the Kindle version is made available, if not I will not purchase the paper version.  I'm sorry my review of this product is based on media rather than content, your choice publishers not mine.
B00B2EWNWG|1.0|I went and saw this at the movie theater.  It was the worst movie ever made.  Bad plot. Bad acting.
B004Y042N8|5.0|My granddaughter - 6 years old- loves playing thi game and.  I think it is good for her thought process....
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|The game is Amazing not to hard and not to easy. I highly recommend this game to everyone who likes point and click game.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|My grandson just loves all this Karate and Kung Fu stuff, I love this one because it teaches more then fighting.
B00APUQPX6|5.0|Another great addition to the Ice Age series. Great animation, with a funny story line, cast of characters and good family entertainment.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|One for the kids and one for the adults.  The first Alice in Wonderland was of the younger girl and the Johny Depp is of the older girl and more for adults.
B007FJFDXS|4.0|This is a cool game for gaining touch control when you have some time to kill. I like all the different levels though sometimes it is difficult to figure out how to get around the obstacles.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft pocket edition is on our Kindle Fire.  My kids can share this game, they absolutely love all the different things they can do while playing.  They use their creativity and there isn't violence.
B00ATCVA4O|5.0|This is a must have album for any true rock fan!  love the harmonies and Martin's guitar work is outstanding!
B000E8QVWY|5.0|I bought this for me. It arrived in great shape and just what I expected. The package was like new.
6305922756|5.0|I don't have anything else to say than my headline so I'm just filling up this space to get it posted!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This app is easy to use, does exactly what says it is supposed to and does it very well. You can download youtube videos and watch them off line. It also has a &quot;as music&quot; option,where youcan just listen. Very very good app. 100% happy with it
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Hears much about this book from both men and women. Was not the page turner it was made out to be. Ending was somewhat predictable but did not build to it.
B008MM9630|5.0|I like this app because it doesn't matter how old you are to enjoy this game. My friends would like this app too.
B007NESBK2|5.0|Another Good Concert but this one from the sultry Sade is in Blu Ray, i just wish that hher other Concerts on dvd were also in Blu Ray, maybe it will happen. Buy it!!
B000N2HBSO|4.0|A long, detailed account of Lincoln's political career. I found this book very helpful in understanding the underpinnings of the Civil War.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|This is perfect for scribbling and basic sketches. The tip is firm and the weight of the stylus provides most of the pressure necessary to get the touch screen to respond. Great for use with gloves in a colder environment. If you're looking for a precision art device you may want something with a smaller footprint, but for everything else this is perfect.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This free Solitaire app is great. This game is simple, fun and I would recommend for people of all ages.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I wanted a quick way to check the weather as we get a lot of SNOW and lake effect storms.  This fits the bill.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I enjoyed it very much awesome graphics! Addicting.<br />Get it get it get it. you will truly enjoy the game.
B00005JKGO|3.0|I waited many years before seeing La Dolce Vita. When it came out it was considered very avant-garde and scandalous. It was discussed and advertised as a movie about people with too much time and not enough to do, pampered wastrels. Once the DVD became available I found the price prohibitive and I'm still not convinced that it $35 this movie is \\"all that\\".<br /><br />This is a young Frederico Fellini clearly a rising director but evidently not interested in telling any one particular story. I've always admired his willingness to use people and places that are not obviously Hollywood perfect faces or perfect sets. Marcello Mastroianni is young, handsome, performs well but, ultimately his character is not very likable. One wonders if this character is worth so much of our time. Anita Ekberg is also young more than just beautiful also performs as directed but if you haven't figured it out yet the story is such a muddle it's hard to judge why any performer is doing anything.<br /><br />The opening scene is brilliantly conceived. A helicopter, a rather exotic piece of equipment given that this film was shot in 1961 is tracked as it flies over Rome carrying a statue of Christ only to have the news photographers flying in trail and led by Mastroianni get distracted by the sight of bikini'ed bathing beauties. The imagery of religion, tradition and history in conflict with the pleasures of the flesh, compromises of modern times and so forth, were probably very new and exciting concepts for the motion picture goer of 50 years ago. Parenthetically this same opening is brilliantly satirized by Steve Martin in his opening of LA Story.<br /><br />From here on the movie turns into a series of short more or less connected scenes mostly of the womanizing time waster played by Mastroianni, the various hangar on'ers, actors and actresses alternately emoting and posing and enjoying the good life while not being very happy. Again very experimental and perhaps very exciting 50 years ago. I found all of this a mix of sometimes interesting visuals and storyline and sometimes wishing Fellini would get on and get over with it.<br />La Dolce Vita is one of the classics and will hold its place on that list with or without my support. A student of film, a serious collector or simply a more thoughtful viewer is justified in considering this film. In this case I am not in any of those categories.I found all of this a mix of sometimes interesting visuals and storyline and sometimes wishing Fellini would get on and get over with it.<br />La Dolce Vita is one of the classics and will hold its place on that list with or without my support.

0547884591|5.0|This book is one of the best. Tim Ferriss is an awesome author. Ive learned so much from this book and I would highly recommend it to anyone trying to learn ANYTHING. 5stars+
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked the book and will be discussing it in our book club.  There are parts of the book that are disturbing, but I guess that is the intrigue of the story.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The second part of this trilogy was better than the first. I can't wait to read the third and final book.
B007EECSFA|5.0|We chose this book for our book club.  This is our second Kate Morton book that we chose.  The author didn't disappoint us.  It was a wonderful read and we had a great discussion about this book.
B0001I562I|5.0|It arrived on time. And it was in excellent condition. We have already watched<br />it, and enjoyed it very much. It was as advertised.  Thank you.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I had to read this book because everyone was talking about it.  I didn't want to feel left out.  It is not great literature.  People read it for the shock effect.  I did read the whole trilogy.
B008MM9630|5.0|I like that you can raise animals and planet crops. It's really addictive. I just spent 20,000 of the money you get on  a cowfly. I was really worth it though!
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|This motion picture brought the sentimental hatd ass in me, right out.  Wish I lived back in the day.  Simple times.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Have played this for years! was very happy to find it for my kindle! this is my go to game to unwind after work
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run is a terrific game! The graphics are amazing  i mean finding a free game for a kindle fire is not the easiest. My friend recommend this for me and im obsessed this game.

B0090P98Z4|5.0|Love this game great on my iPhone and kindle fire!!<br />Been playing since about August needs more updates and double coin bonus
B003O86FMW|4.0|I'm not much if a reader but I really enjoyed this book.  It kept me wanting more. Looking forward to the next one.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This novel is magnificent. It's witty, sarcastic, but most of all thought provoking. I couldn't put it down and I loved it because it make cry and laugh often at the same time.
B0096PYUE2|1.0|I haven't been able to figure out what it does for my kindle fire.  Still cant get some videos or pictures
B000FC1KBG|5.0|Secrets of a Baby Whisperer is a must read for new parents!  I would love to have had this book when I was a new Mom, but now I am Nana and appreciate the clarity and honesty of a nanny with much experience.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I really like this product as it has great sounds that I like to hear as relaxation.  Great on my kindle fire
B00288KNLS|2.0|Coraline is an excellent movie that is best viewed in 3D. We looked carefully to find a version that was NOT analgyph, that did not come with special glasses. As of January 2013, this item did not show it included such glasses so we thought we had the right one. WRONG. It comes with the inexpensive glasses. So...it may work OK with standard TV, but it is not optimized for the new 3D TV/DVD/Active glass combo. Other complaint: the movie disc is two sided - one for 3d & one for 2d viewing. BUT, it is not labelled, so you have to insert it in the player to figure out which side it's playing on - big annoyance and time-waster.
B002FOQY2W|5.0|First off, Fun. doesn't get the credit they deserve on this album since Some Nights really brought them to popularity, this one is often looked past. All the pretty Girls and Walking the Dog were my first impression of this album like most people and they were both solid and my favorites for awhile. Then I bought this and really listened to the songs and noticed many more were better. Fun. really put their best into this album with Be Calm, Benson Hedges, At least im not as sad (as i used to) and Barlights. Some Nights while great is personally not close to how good this album. I don't regret a second for buying this vinyl, and they even included the Audio CD. Well worth the money and all the Artwork is amazing. If any part of you is thinking to get this, get it. Great Album.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is the most refreshingly different and exciting book I have read in the last five years!  I rooted for poor Nick,  to no avail. The characters are so well written.  Though it is fiction, the insights into male, female relationships give one food for thought. I loved this book. Can't wait to read other books by this author!
B004QX07G4|4.0|I love that book! I love the show to so if u like the show you will love the book!I also love how there are crosses on some of the last pages Ian christian…if you are not you should be. But anyway this book is great
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I used ebay quite regularly to sell items as well as purchase items. I love the ebay app for my phone. It is so convient to use to check on my auctions. My favorite feature is when I have an item sell is give me a little &#34;cha-ching&#34; tone. The interface it nice and it make it easy to list new items for sale whithout having to sit at my computer. Wonderful app!
B006X5L6VS|1.0|This was all off and no matter what I did.  I would point it to a group of starts and north would be off so I had to delete it.  I would love to try again and see if it would sink in but really don't think I want to spend the money.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The best  book  ever Awesome five stars very very good book I loved it so very entertaining and so sad
B001O9BB3G|5.0|Get novel quite refreshing and the development of characters is just... lovely. The end make me so happy it's exciting to see the bravery of both characters express it self and also the love which seems to always be there. I wish there was more though especially at the end like I knew what happen but I wanted to how the relationship between both characters progressed and developed. Great story in all I read it all the time now.
B004EPYZU8|5.0|This is a great movie!!! Effects, punch line, it's just a good movie!!! And for the price you can beat it
1449410243|5.0|I read &#34;The Oatmeal&#34; online whenever I need a little &#34;cheer me up.&#34; He is so clever, the drawings so adorable, and the cats! Hilarious, especially when they're wearing ties. This guy is a cat & dog lover, you can tell by the way he writes about and draws them. A bit of the book is online but that does not detract from the book. I love to read this stuff over and over – it's that funny. And sweet. And funny! Can you tell I love The Oatmeal? The book does have a &#34;hard spine&#34; and doesn't lay flat but that's the only criticism I have about it. I bought this book as a Christmas present for a co-worker and after he read it he brought it in so we can all read it. It's our &#34;office book.&#34; When we get stressed, we reach for the book and it brings us right back to our &#34;happy place.&#34;
B001UV4XHY|5.0|this was a Christmas present, cost of product was excellent and it was shiipped out right away, very happy with purchase
B007BFSYMS|3.0|No help- how do you exit? Downloaded a new sound via app, tried to import using app controls but says no sounds to import.  well, where should the file be saved to then? other functions took a lot of trial and error to figure out.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is a fun game for horse lover's.  it is a lot of fun.  I love this game it is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I love horses
0553801473|3.0|*SPOILERS AHEAD*<br /><br />I was prepared for the worst while reading this, based on some of the reviews, but it isn't as bad as people make it out to be. It's true that a 'bad' GRRM book is much better than most out there. Still, I can't help but feel disappointed that there's very little plot advancement after yet another 1,000 pages and hours of reading. The first thing the reader will notice is that the book begins about halfway through Feast for Crows and those who are dead are not and events that have happened are still to come. It can be a little disorienting at first, and a bit of a waste of time.<br /><br />There are three main issues I have with the book.. the first is the shock of main characters dying has worn off because, well, they don't stay dead. So anyone who dies might still come back and haunt the rest of the book. Character deaths therefore lose their punch; I keep waiting to hear about Robb leading another host. The second issue is the rush of new characters. Aegon, really? The Prince of Dorne? Are they necessary? Why do we care? And therein lies my biggest critique -- we've emotionally invested in the characters only to see to them killed off, marginalized, and/or supplanted by new ones. Tyrion is probably the most glaring example of this. He still seems to have the smarts that made him a central force through the first couple books, but here, he's a shell of himself, a caricature of himself, and half of his travels are wholly unnecessary if they did away with the Dorne subplot. And Jon........<br /><br />I'll finish the series if GRRM sees fit to finish it. And I recommend the book but didn't feel the need to power through with sleepless nights. Not that there's any rush, anyway.. there's no timetable on the next one, so pick your way through the world and settle in for a long ride.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I and a lot of people have waited a long time for this app on amazon.  now that its here it is amazing!
B008K3HRF0|5.0|This is a great movie for the entire family! Good story, good characters, and a good lesson about taking care of our earth.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|This game is so fun I really recemend it to people that dont do much. I play it all the time over the weekends even in the car get this game!! :)
B00330UFQS|5.0|Some might say Country music has lost its soul, and others are glad for the progressive sound as more artists target the pop audience. Lady Antebellum is a crowd pleaser across both ends of the spectrum! Their superior harmonies and incredible musicianship does not come at the expense of articulate writing. To keep it short--more depth than Taylor Swift and fresher than Rascal Flatts.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|the horses are so pretty!!! I love taking care and competing my beauty!!! dgb gib Gibb gbbfdhczx ghvc fvv ggv
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This was honestly the best book ive read in years and ive read a lot. The characters were extremely likeable and easy to relate to. I found myself getting attached to them and desperate to find out what happens next in the story. I would cry when something sad happened and get angry when something was unfair or someone was hurt (emotionally). I actually found myself venting my own frustrations into poetry and realized what an amazing outlet it is. This book is inspiring and an amazing read. Definitely worth every cent
B0087EVHVW|5.0|Great Processor for the price. does everything i need and more... upgraded from a i5 760 and couldn't be any happier.<br /><br />i5 3470<br />MSI Z77 GD-55<br />G.Skill RipjawsX 1600 16gb<br />MSI Twinfrozriii GTX 660
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is sick soooo realistic. i love all the horses.i don't like that everything is sooo expense<br />ather than that it is sick. i loovvee it so much
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|game had really great graphics. was worth the money. I like that you got to sample it before buying it
B00AY7Q01C|2.0|I love the man's music and I have his two albums, but this sound track isn't right, sounds like background music...I'm not sure how to describe it, but I won't be playing it again .<br />I've also downloaded the video and loved that too.
B00AYQNOU8|5.0|This film was exquisite. It was just breath taking and mesmerizing but at the same time super sad and depressing. I got so emotional at times and cried. This film just  brought tears to my eyes. It was overall great and I loved it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the story and the characters.  I thought that certain things would occur and then I was surprised when it wasn't as predictable as I thought.<br />Great story
B008TMA1LY|5.0|Good ap for all ages, we do not purchase the extra tokens so it makes it a little limited, but even without the tokens it still enjoyful for my daughter.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This is a great book for a great price.  I felt that the book was way better than the movie -- as is usually the case.
140053271X|5.0|It got here very quickly. It was a gift for my mom and she uses it all the time. She loves it. It was easy for her to learn how to use and she reads off of it almost everyday. It is a great product.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|i knew Nicholas Sparks was a good writer but never imagined this. i found my self falling in love with the main characters!.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|this game is fun and all but I have to wait so long for it to load don't buy this app its not worth it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I couldn't put the book down!  Every chapter kept you wanting for more.  Waiting until the very end is a killer for me, but what a smart thing to do as a writer.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This game is fun to play.  I recommend it for all ages.  Bonus: it is free. We play it all the time.
B00005JPD0|5.0|This movie is very intense. You'll be talking about it for days after you watch it. You'll even want to watch it again!
B005LAJ23A|5.0|I am addicted to Walking Dead!  Usually I watch a show or movie and then it goes on my shelf.  I could watch Walking Dead every day!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app! it is a little confusing at first and kind of boring when you don't have money and XP. but I would suggest this game to everyone! and believe me; all is worth it once you get a high level
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I love love love this book. It made me laugh,,be angry,and cry my eyes out. This is one of those books that will stay with me forever
B003XZ0WPM|3.0|I was entertained and would watch a sequel if one is ever made.  I used Instant Video to rent this.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I really like this game! You cant help but want to play it all the time! I am constantly playing this game!
B009SCRERI|5.0|We had been waiting for this to finally become available for rental with Instant Video. The kids loved this movie.  They laughed quite a bit.  Tears welled up as a story of love and sacrifice was revealed.
B003MC5N28|5.0|We purchased for a school read and love it on the kindle fire with the feature of touching a word and it giving the definition so she understands what she is reading.
1594487154|5.0|Daniel Pink is great at taking scientific evidence and using it to challenge &#34; accepted wisdom&#34; ( do check out  &#34;Drive&#34; if you haven't read it)... and again he has taken accepted wisdom ( who sells, how they sell) and tossed it in the air... I love the idea of a one word pitch... in relation to this book I would say &#34;essential&#34;.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|A good read.  The story gave me a lot of new ideas that I have not thought of before.  Just the idea of a genetic soldier is fascinating.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|It is a very nice app, I recommend it for everyone and it is super cool and stuff but I don't always want to read the bible but it is still awesome and stuff so ya you and every one else should get the app it is not bad at all.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|I'm absolutely thrilled that they decided to record a performance of Phantom on dvd, as it is my favorite musical of them all.  I don't understand the negative reviews.  I've seen it in person about a dozen times, & watching this dvd felt like being right back at the theater again, experiencing the myriad of emotions I felt during each and every live show.  Simply wonderful-Bravo!
0375869026|5.0|Beautiful story! I would share this book with students in grades 3 and up and their parents - many adults can learn from this book.<br />Thank you for reminding us that, \\"It is only with one's heart that one can see clearly. What is essential is invisible to the eye.\\" From The Little Prince and R.J. Palacio's remarkable novel, Wonder.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I started reading it to see what the hype was all about and I couldn't finish it.  It made my skin crawl.  I know a lot of other people like it, but the storyline was not for me.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I am so glad I bought the Kindle for this book. I read it in record time. Can't wait to see what the next generation does.
0792844890|5.0|One of the more all-out hilarious movies ever made. This one is up there along with Top Secret and Leslie Nielsen's movies :-D<br /><br />Every few years we gather a bunch of friends for a movie-weekend, and this is on the list! THIS is what a parody should be made like!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Me and me kids have so much fun w this, we don't even need an extra camera app its got everything in one package! It's for sure the most used on my kindle, an I have recommended it over and over and will continue to share the fun me and my kids have with pic art studio with many more friends! I would recommend it to anyone!
B00B2V66VS|2.0|This is just a spin of of survival run. When people found out about sr and what you could do in it they had to download it. Imangi Studios was just trying to get back to the top of the popularity list. I will not get this game and I think you should try sr before this.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. The characters were refreshing, interesting, and well-developed. Thought-provoking, entertaining, and \\"real\\". Would enthusiastically recommend.
B003O86FMW|4.0|not as good as the first one but kept you interested and wanting to read the 3rd book straight away/
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Kids liking it!  Even I'm liking it.  Haven't been playing long, but so far it is going good with no problems.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I did enjoy the third book better than the first two.  They are all a little disturbing so read with an open mind.
B005K2LNZ4|1.0|Let me say emphatically that this review relates to this particular vinyl release, and not the music itself. If you've not heard Mark Hollis, do yourself a favor and cozy up to this incredibly sensitive and heartfelt production. It truly is some of the best music ever recorded.  That being said, this vinyl edition is very poor.  I have been embracing and buying lots of new vinyl to play on my new turntable/pre-amp system in my studio, and unlike everything else I've been listening to and been blown away by, this pressing is very noisy - it sounds worse than well worn/dirty vinyl I've played for over 20 years, and this was fresh out of the sleeve.  Given the quiet nature of this music, it's disappointing to point of being unlistenable.  I purchased Laughing Stock (Talk Talk) from this very same manufacturer, and it has identical problems.  It amazes me that this would have escaped quality control, so it seems to me that there may be a specific problem with this batch of pressings.  I can't recommend it at all, and feel I wasted my money.  For shame.  PS - for what it's worth, there are vinyl editions of Spirit of Eden and The Colour of Spring released by a different company and they both sound stunning.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|Works like a champ. Upgraded from a quad core 2.6 GHZ processor. Love that if my GPU goes, I have a backup!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this app several times a day to keep up with the weather. Full of very helpful info with this app.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I started it late last night and finished it this afternoon, I had the hardest time putting it down!!! Highly recommend this book!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really enjoy this.  my husband also enjoy s this game<br />Thank you for creating a fun game.  I first used it first on my cell phone and now use it on my kindle too.
B005FISBV2|5.0|So intresting! Always has an amazing season! The best tv show ive seen! I recommend this show to everyone!! Action, drama, sex, gore and love!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I enjoyed the book because the characters were so believable. The writing is so good that I could imagine the sights, smells, and tastes included in the story.<br /> Isolation is hardly ever written about and this author does a beautiful job wrting about what it is and what it does to people. What goes on behind &#34;closed doors&#34; can be hellish nightmares beyond all our wildest imaginations, as this story captured so well. Isolation is so painful,it can only be medicated by intoxications of any sorts,whether it is drugs, alcohol, sex, or even abusing people.<br />.I also believe the author does a great job with the on going silent division between the races (African American/Black & Caucasion/White). Deep down people want to break down the barriers that separate us, but the &#34;bad apples&#34; or the ones with power, seem to ruin the chance of reconciliation. The division carries on throughout generations.<br />The different characters and each of their tragedies were all very believable and written in a heartfelt manner. My heart ached for each of them. What tragedies!
B0013FSL3E|5.0|So this movie in the theater and liked it. Bought this to have a personal copy. I always buy a dvd of movies that I like.
B009POCG5Y|5.0|Very good movie.  Clint Eastwood does a great job.  It was sad to see him geting older.  The movie had a good ending, but I am not going to ruin it, so buy the movie.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Action, adventure, romance, and the super natural.. What more can a girl ask for? I read the complete series as well as the infernal devices in one month, thats how much I loved it.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|This apps starts out fun, fun soon the glitches made it VERY annoying. I would put heart chests in a friend's village and they never show up.  The more annoying glitch happened MANY times was when I would play the games to level them up, which soon got old, and after even paying more to have the points for more, the game wouldn't give me the points.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Who does not want a free game to play?  Angry birds season is the bomb and it keeps my little one occupied when we are in the car driving.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|The storyline sounded so good I was willing to give it a shot even though I don't often do the subtitle thing. Within 15 minutes, I had forgotten I was reading subtitles and stayed &#34;in the zone&#34; for the rest of the movie. Outstanding. One of the best movies I've ever seen, and it's not one of those that, a year from now, I'll say &#34;Yeah, I saw that...I don't have a clue what it was about, though...&#34;. A cautionary tale of what happens when corrupt government gets too big and intrudes in every aspect of your life; how good people can wake up one morning and realize they are a part of the corruption without ever having intended to be. A story of quiet redemption, self-sacrificial heroism, rewarded only by the knowledge of doing the right thing. I won't ruin the ending, but even with subtitles I had tears running down my face, and I'm normally pretty stoic. See it! I went out and purchased it after renting it once.
B00AVTMB4I|5.0|I thought this movie was fantastic. Had a little something for everyone. Also cool because it was filmed in my High School
B008ELUEQC|5.0|One of the best christmas albums to come along in many years.  Smooth, light and excellent choice of songs. Thanks Rod!
B00136NVH4|5.0|GREAT ALBUM. NEVER GOES OUT OF STYLE. WILL LIVE ON FOREVER. WHAT MORE CAN I SAY. IT IS GREAT GREAT.
141659521X|3.0|It was good, although not up to Flynn's usual standard in the Mitch Rapp series. It could have benefited with better editing---there was a long spell in the story filled with characters that were not so interesting or crucial to the story, during which time Rapp was absent, slowing down the tension necessary to move the story forward.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This is the best thing for my Kindle. Just as good as the more expensive ones. Would recommend it to everyone.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|Downloaded this 3 times to try and get it right! The app only works if I turn my Kindle upside down! Called to get help, my connection was lost, no call back...Guess I'll pick up my ipad to search.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|just got this today, its fun learning..challenging to play until u Learn the different parts of the game. graphics are great
B0063IH60K|3.0|Really?  An ad before every deal??? I can &#34;deal&#34; with an intro ad but too many is a pain.  Game is enjoyable....
B007REV4T8|5.0|Skyfall is hugely entertaining.  Production values are of course very high.  Acting first rate.  Saw Red Dawn a few weeks back, another patriotic action shoot'm up.  Skyfall stands head and shoulders above Red Dawn, in a different league.  Daniel Craig has a very distinct and appealing Bond style.  Not wry and witty at all.  Just very firm and stable.  Never flustered, never afraid.  No love interest, really no Bond girl.  Action packed, fast paced and deferential to the James Bond 007 tradition.  They normally don't make movies like they used to.  They have been making great Bond films for 50 years.  Skyfall is among the best.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this game is awesome but it gets glitchy after a while. ill be in a game ill try to revieve myself and it sometimes exits. ill jump and my player wont jump. I think temple run (the first one) is more accurate in my opinion. but over all it's very fun and adicting.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a cool game. It is more challenging than the first one, but it is more fun. My favorite part is when you ride on the mining cart.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My brother pointed out this game and I love it!  It starts out slow and gets faster.  Haven't got ads yet so thats great. Best game I've ever played! Thanks!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Should give you a break and make stages ,you  know like save areas.are there? Haven't gotten to far yet. Nice new graphics and  obstacles
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Good storyline, nice graphics. Sucked me in,  and kept my attention during an otherwise long and uneventful  car trip. Would reccomend it.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|We were looking for a comedy on prime, so I first sorted the list by rating. This movie - one I had never heard of - was on the first page among old  TV shows and other movies I had no interest in watching. Could it really have 272 5-star ratings?  I was suspicious.<br /><br />This movie was much better than we had expected.  Definitely a pleasant (ok, perhaps not the best choice of words) surprise. Tears-in-eyes funny.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|This is a must own if you are a fan of the FF series and if you are not, still get it, the graphics are amazing and it is a wonder why DC or Marvel do not try and make a movie in this style.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The winning tributes of the Hunger Games must inconceivably go back to the arena.  President Snow is more evil than ever.  Katniss must deal with a lot of stress and her feelings for Peeta.
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|A man of his convictions, a wonderful story. It is possible to do as I have done it in my life.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was absolutely riveting.  I turned the pages as quickly as possible.  The ending was a complete surprise.  Just the concept for the Hunger Games was wild.
B00884GR0W|3.0|Look if your reading this this game ain't half bad the graphics are awesome it looks like real life but the controls aren't good they get really annoying the quests you get are easy ,but the first one is but the rest aren't so I would get minecraft pocket edition because it's way better than this game and the other versions are awesome they are on Xbox and the computer  so if you like graphics and don't care about controls good luck<br />P.S joshua David gonzalez wrote this
B00APUQJLO|4.0|We couldn't decide if we loved or hated this movie. It is certainly thought provoking. But watching it is a little like watching a Quintin Tarantino movie crossed with Bad Lip Reading You Tube flick. Sometimes the dialog is so out there, you think they can't possibly be serious with this??!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|ok so its good for a while then 5 hours later it wont let you on. you have to uninstall it then install it again but I think it erases all your progress so get it if you must but I'm warning you.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|fun....and addictive love the storyline behind it. use of strategy is good, great for mindnumbing as well. i suggest it for any age
B000VDDDVO|5.0|This is an awesome movie that I searched for ans happy to own. This will now be added to our family tradition at the Christmas.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Absolutely fascinating read, couldn't ask for More, I am so in love with these characters...amazing. can't wait to read book 3
B004WGIXX4|4.0|This movie offers exactly what I was expecting : nice characters, sweet love situation with not much suspense (but who cares), and good dialogue, sometimes truly hilarious. All of it is highly un-probable, but who said it is supposed to be (was Pretty Woman' s plot believable at all?)
B003DZX3SA|5.0|Brand new packaging.  Updated sleeve.  Updated sound. A lot more expensive when then when I was a kid, but what you gonna do..
B005ZTFPFQ|4.0|Its a pretty good app.  The controls are a little weird since its a touch screen but it still brings back old memories.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I don't know what others are complicating about. I can't find anything wrong with this app other than it doesn't have an &#34;exit&#34; option. Great deal for free!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  Highly recommend reading it and tkaing the information for what it's worth.  Overall SEALs are amazing

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I am a big fan of diary of a wimpy kid,and by far,this book was really good,i just couldnt turn my head,it was that good
B0073XV2W2|3.0|I really liked the author's previous books - they were sort of Silicon Valley tech books.  It looks like he tried to broaden his market and target more of the Michael Crichton market.  Perhaps he succeeded, but in doing so, he distanced himself from the more uber geek culture.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Excellent!!!!!now to find a grey for myself!  I really liked how she falls back on her inner self for guidance
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice... Well, I actually gave this app three tries, and it got me good. What a waste of time. This game resets itself after you have achieved every possible goal and unlocked every possible upgrade. Never again will I play a \\"Temple Run\\" game. This latest time I lost every upgrade, 368,000 coins, and 765 Gems. No other app has ever done this to me, and TR2 has done it three times. Never again!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book made me cry, made me laugh, made me wish people would leave me alone so I could just read. This is one book I will keep to read again. I will be looking for other books by Colleen Hoover.

B009GEFXLC|5.0|Haven't been able to watch so this has let me catch up and keep up.  I was afraid I was going to miss the whole season.  Plays great!
0810989956|4.0|My son begged for this book. Once its done its done so beware. If your kid goes through it fast then thats it. But he really liked it.
1401322786|1.0|I have really enjoyed Mitch Albom's previous books, so I decided to try this one.  I really love to read, but this book was so boring that I stopped reading after about 50 pages.  I regret wasting the money on this purchase.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Great time waster for those that have the time.<br /><br />I suggest that people buy the DJ Barry clothing option to change the music. I also enjoy the game more for fun when I purchased the counterfeit coin duplicator.
B006P3HXZG|1.0|the original Puss character from Shrek was fantastic, but this movie was a total disappointment. Trite with poor taste. Stay away.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Another free app of the day pickup.<br />If you like those bridge building type games, you'll love this.<br />Different types of &#34;goo&#34; have different building characteristics.

B00APUQH0W|3.0|Typical late era Eastwood. Slow moving but always seems to have a payoff at the end. Casting could have been better.
B0081SPK0I|5.0|Picked this up as a free app of the day.<br />Plays like a perfect upgrade of the old Arcade/Genesis game OutRun.<br />I'm not a fan of the tilt to steer controls in a lot of other games, but it works well here.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This book started slow, but I must say I ha not read the first book- after I figured out what was going on it pulled me in-  I laughed, cried and  enjoyed the entire book-  it's not often that a book can pull me in so deeply-  so-  I bought the first book (I buy audible) and it really comes together-

B000641MB6|5.0|I've loved this movie for years and it's a must-see every Christmas.  I had it on VHS (I know that dates me lol) and finally decided to upgrade to DVD.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I had a hard time at first trying to put the story line together, but as usual Mitch tied it all together and it was a great read!
B0053O89KG|5.0|I had to have this set to complete my &#34;Castle&#34; collection.  This show keeps getting better every year.  The stories and characters change and evolve but everyone stays true to who they are--and the have the most interesting cases while still keeping the human element involved.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Maybe it's my age or something, but this story really touched me.  The book has so many levels to it and each one just fascinated me - I really related to them.  On the other hand, I don.t think one has to be 70 years off age and be married for a long time to enjoy this work - not at all.  The author clearly has a long and successful literary career behind her.  Her tale is woven in a masterly way and full of life, love lost and re-found,sorry joy,struggle, failure and success.  I really liked it
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I bought this along with season 3 to coninue to fill out my &#34;Castle&#34; collection.  I love the show and think everything about it is great, from Nathan and Stana to all the supporting cast.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I love G5 games and this one follows suit.  interesting. story line not to challenging. puzzles are are not too difficult.
B003L77FYS|5.0|I love &#34;Castle&#34; and wanted to continue adding to the dvd collection.  I purchased season 3, along with season 2 when I did not get them for Christmas.
B00B0U8ROK|5.0|This show is by far one of the best if not the best series I've seen on television in a few years. It's intriguing, interesting, full of action, adventure, romance. The story line and ongoing suspense make you crave for more show after show. I have both season 1 and season 2 and I'm anticipating many more to come.
B00973902K|5.0|kicky, upbeat.  Appealing to many segements and the orchesration is good.  The kid really has it going on.  Wow and boom.
0312853238|5.0|I will read anything that Orson Scott Card writes.  His characters are engaging, his settings imaginative, his insight into the human condition riveting!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|The app will not open after a few times of play. Get the bugs fixed and i will re rate it 5 stars!
B007A4SDCG|5.0|I liked the ideas so much, that I gave it as a Christmas gift to my son-in-law!  That by itself is a huge recommendation.  He is a blogger, actor, and IT guru--all reasons he will love, The War of Art.  But, that's not why I gave it to him.  He's the father of my Grandkids!  That's why I gave it to him.<br />I had been using Steven Pressman's book with my clients, with remarkable success.  I recommended it to one of my clients to assist him in his relationship with his spouse.  I knew I was on to something when he called and told me hated me!  Seriously, it's a  compliment when a single book can stir up a marriage, a partnership or a writing block in such a way that major shifts occur.<br />I want that kind of information for my clients, I want that for my grandkids and I want that for you.<br />Get your copy, read it twice and watch the magic happen.  You'll hate me for it, too! I hope.

B00A8ECU24|3.0|Although this fun, it would be more fun if there were more than three games within the game and if you didn't need friends to complete a task. I know nobody my age (32) who wants to play this with me, but it brings back some nostalgia!

034580404X|4.0|I only read the first one. I'm not really into that rough stuff. Didn't really do it for me. Was a simple read.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game because of all of  The new things like big monkey zipline and mincraft. It is just as fun as temple run
B0034G4P80|5.0|Ok movie. Cheeper to buy than go to the movies. I like pop corn and butter with my movies. Thank you.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is really cool and gets very exciting but I have to say that there are some problems with it... sometimes it doesn't save your run and it freezes sometimes, but I do still recommend it and ITS FREE!!!
0547258305|5.0|Graceling is a story about Katsa, a rare individual Graced with a supernatural level of skill - in her case, the Grace of killing.  Although previously the king has used Katsa to enforce his often cruel will on his subjects, in this novel she begins to question her place in his plans and discover her own identity.  There is also a handsome prince (a supporting character who complements but doesn't overshadow our heroine) and of course an evil villain.<br /><br />This book has pretty much everything going for it.  I loved the characters.  Katsa and the prince really do complement one another perfectly.  Katsa in particular develops a lot as a character and I personally like novels where the characters grow into better people.  We also got to learn the back stories of a decent number of the side characters, enough so that they don't feel too one dimensional, although the focus is definitely on Katsa and the prince.  The plot was fairly straightforward and there was never any difficulty distinguishing good from evil, but as a YA book I don't necessarily expect that.<br /><br />The backgrounds of both the characters and the kingdom blended well with the present-day plot.  At the same time, the mechanics of the magical Graces were well thought out and well explained.  Although the idea of in-born magic isn't new, I found the variety of ways it could manifest itself relatively novel.  I also really liked that each individual's Grace followed particular rules (we mostly learn about Katsa's and the prince's) and once those rules were established they weren't broken.  They were also fairly believable rules, with no odd little restrictions added just to steer the plot.<br /><br />In summary, this book had a well-developed, believable world with great characters and the writing was excellent.  I would particularly recommend this series to Tamora Pierce fans.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Breath Taking Story That I Couldn't Put Down For A Second!!! Definitely Deserves 4 Stars. It Was All Inspiring To Me The Way Katniss Stood Up For Herself And Wouldn't Get Proved Wrong, All Through Out This Deadly War The Was Meant For Only One To Survive. This Book Should Be Recommended For Any Age That Can Handle It. It's Touching And Can Send Chills Down Your Spine !!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this app. But I think at the end of every level you should be awarded more that just one jewel.
0525952926|5.0|I enjoyed this book and thought it was a good second book for the century trilogy. I think it stands up to Follets previous works.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|What a great read!! I finished it in less than a day. It's funny, intelligent and highly entertaining. I mostly read thrillers, but this was way different and I just loved every bit. some of the things were so funny, I laughing so hard. I wanted to get to the end at the same time not finish it. I am going to see if there are more books by this author.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I adore this series!  Maggy Smith is fantastic and Shirley McClain should have been on longer. Will there be a season 4?
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This was an amazing book I could never put down. I was fascinated to  no end. The characters were amazingly developed and I loved each and every one Of them. The photographs were a fabulous addition  to the book and I enjoyed the visual help. This book was perfectly peculiar.
B0091REZMW|4.0|its a cool game if ur into object searching but its kinda repetitive. my sister loves it so I keep it anyway, and play it sometimes when I'm bored.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it! Great way to spend time. I have  this  on my phone and Kindle, and I love playing on both.
B007SGM084|3.0|I found the author did not keep my attention.  It took me a long time to complete Fifty Shades of Gray, I just lost interest.  To me, it became same thing over and over.  It just was not a good read for me.  So, back to my spy novels and murder mystery type books. I donated Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed without reading them.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Loved the final book. It was captivating right from the beginning to the exciting end. What a exceptional saga. I never have enjoyed reading a series so much  before. Can't wait to see the movies. Didn't want the story to end.

1400079144|3.0|I really enjoy reading Dan Browns work. I absolutely loved \\" davinci code\\" and also like his other four books. I think he's a great writer and my favorite. I see some reviews say Brown is a mediocre, or weak writer. My question is, if he's weak then what do you consider \\"great\\"?  I'm curios and would love to read one of those authors books.

B004YM6JK0|5.0|If you love the show, you gotta get blu-ray. The scenes are amazing.<br />The only thin I didn't like, the controls on this one is similar to the season 6, which is a little bit harder to use.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|i am only a few chapters into the book and thought i should read it b/c everyone has already read the book.  it is alright.  i think if i was a young woman in her late teens or early 20's, i would enjoy the book more.  it is very juvenile and i am almost 40 years old.  it is an easy read and very light and fluffy, which is good, if that is what you are looking for.
B000YXMMAO|5.0|One of Radiohead's greatest in my opinion. A great one to have as an LP. A decently clean pressing, and slightly hard to find. Pick it up, and you won't be disappointed. It's a great addition to any collection.

B00007KWHO|3.0|`Time and a Word', the 1970 second album release from Yes, has a distinct character different from the rock-pop feel of the debut and different again from the 1971 landmark `Yes Album' where the young band found its definitive sound. Some see TaaW as a kind of ambitious but failed experiment and for sure it doesn't float every fan's boat, but it definitely has its moments and is in many ways a lot more interesting than Yes' first album.<br /><br />TaaW has the founding Yes line-up, i.e. Peter Banks on guitar and Tony Kaye on keyboards replaced within 2 years by Steve Howe and Rick Wakeman respectively. The distinctive sound of TaaW is the ambitious and not always successful use of orchestral strings on most of the tracks, a Jon Anderson initiative which instigated a row with Peter Banks leading to his departure from the band the day recordings were completed. Generally the strings get in the way more than they augment the sound, though they work well on `Everydays' and on the explosive opener, an imaginative re-work of Ritchie Havens' `No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed' which is for me the album's star track.<br /><br />The standout musician is Chris Squire, whose inventive and busy use of bass guitar in the treble register drives along the more rock-based numbers (like `Sweet Dreams' and the aforementioned `No Opportunity...'). Anderson's song writing is one of the album's weaknesses: not yet developed to creating impressionistic lyrical landscapes so characteristic of the `Yes sound', `The Prophet' and the title track `TaaW' in particular sound naïve, new-agey and dated.<br /><br />But overall TaaW is interesting as a historic oddity, with more ambitious multi-part compositions like `Everydays' and `Astral Traveller' (you can hear the musical origins of `Starship Trooper' in this song) signposting the band's future direction, which they were to declare unambiguously with the follow-up, the international best-selling `Yes Album.'<br /><br />This re-mastered CD has 4 bonus tracks: the version of `Dear Father' originally on the B-side of the `Sweet Dreams' single, and alternate takes of `No Opportunity...', `Sweet Dreams' and `the Prophet' - none significantly different to those featured on the original album.<br /><br />The usual 16-page booklet insert completes the package featuring a retrospective penned by Mike Tiano, all the song lyrics and period photos of the band. The B&W surrealist painting of the naked girl which graced the original UK album cover was deemed too prurient for the US market, and was replaced by a photo of the band. There are plenty of good photos of the line-up featuring Peter Banks, but the decision was made to use a photo with Steve Howe in place of Banks on the US album cover, as Howe had already joined the band at the time of release of TaaW.stered CD has 4 bonus tracks: the version of `Dear Father' originally on the B-side of the `Sweet Dreams' single, and alternate takes of `No Opportunity...', `Sweet Dreams' and `the Prophet' - none significantly different to those featured on the original album.<br /><br />The usual 16-page booklet insert completes the package featuring a retrospective penned by Mike Tiano, all the song lyrics and period photos of the band.

1416550534|3.0|I'm in the minority here, but I didn't like this book at all. I was sure I would, given all the glowing reviews, and I love the time period. It certainly sounded promising - but I felt though that this novel never lived up to the cover blurb: \\"In the summer of 1924, at a glittering society party held at the house, a young poet shot himself. The only witnesses were Hannah and Emmeline and only they -- and Grace -- know the truth.\\" In the end the much-hyped glittering society party is barely described, and the reveal is rather anticlimactic. (No spoilers here, it's all from the cover blurb...). Perhaps because Robbie, the \\"young poet\\" himself is absent for most of the book - not only physically absent, but not even mentioned that much. By the time he shows up again I couldn't see the point of him - he seems to exist only to sound mysterious and interesting in the blurb - and couldn't muster up any interest in him. As for Grace's mother's \\"secret,\\" once revealed at long, painful last (this reader having \\"guessed\\" it ages ago) nothing much is made of it, either. The \\"glittering society party\\" itself is barely described. It's as if the blurb was thought of first and the novel fabricated around it rather than the other way `round. The narration structure of having Grace, as an elderly woman, telling the story of her days at Riverton in flashbacks, also seemed interesting at first, but I thought the story dragged and became actually boring. I skipped ahead wondering if something would happen soon. Secondly, I didn't think the author captured the period all that well, especially the language, or the depiction of how people of that class spoke and behaved - the formality, the interaction with servants, etc. (If you do read on to the bitter end you'll find the author cites some of her source material - much of it secondary or fictional e.g., Upstairs, Downstairs tv series - and its integration into the novel is a bit obvious. \\"Oh, she must have been reading about the Mitfords\\" I thought at one point, and sure enough one of the sources is a book on the Mitford sisters). I hope for two things in a novel: good writing and a good story. If I get one out of the two I'm happy enough. Good writing will make me forget the story is maybe not so great. In this case I have to say it was zero out of two.\\" I thought at one point, and sure enough one of the sources is a book on the Mitford sisters).

B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple Run 2 is a lot of fun. In my opinion, it's better than the first one. And the game could be practically flawless; however, I find myself cheated out of a new high score, several hundred, even thousand, coins, and a gem or two because of one thing: the \\"Save Me\\" bug. What the \\"Save Me\\" bug is is when you meet your demise in-game, but you want to push forward more by using one of your gems. Using one is fine, bringing you back to life to run again. But when I use a second (or any one after that because I've had a few instances where it would go through for a second time), the whole game would crash and I would be exited out of the game. What would this entail? Well, recently, a loss of a 5 million or more points, a couple thousand coins, and every gem I used, plus the ones I picked up. I don't know if it's because TR2 is still a relatively new game, and it's common for a lot of games to have some flaws after their release, but this flaw is very daunting and it presents the idea of an unstable game.<br /><br />It's a big bug, and I wish the creators would've tested out scenarios like this over and over and over until they were 300% sure something like this wouldn't happen.<br />BUT if this doesn't happen to you, and I hope it doesn't, then you should enjoy TR2 for what it is: a fantastic sequel to a fantastic game that's loads of fun.

B0076DELIG|5.0|Harry Bosch is a flawed man.  He manages to screw up relationships, encourage the enmity of his superiors, and hangs on like a pit bull to his cases.  His sense of justice is his moral beacon, and he follows that light through all of these books.  I always look forward to a new Connelly book and this one didn't disappoint.
B0000E2FLC|5.0|I'd like to summarize why I chose the rating that I did for this product in one simple word - ANGUS!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|PLEASE MAKE THE UNICORNS 1000 COINS!!!!!!!!&iexcl;<br />I would really like that if it were possible! I still like it though
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is the app I've been looking for. It does what it says, soothing sounds that helps you rest. You can't be to picky about to many things. I use it every day to help me rest and sleep. Like I said before it does what it is supposed to do... 5 stars.
B002GU5V24|4.0|I just received this in the mail a few days ago. I'll try and be brief and give a short list of pros and cons, IMO.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Having the 1973 Rainbow concert, especially in 5.1 is amazing. There's never really been a great live Peter-era album, and this is tremendous to have. Energy, humor, and great sound.<br /><br />- Seconds Out sounds terrific. I never had a problem with this album, but it sounds even more clear and more &#34;live&#34; somehow. It feels like the older versions had you sitting in the nosebleeds, and now you're in row 10. Very well done<br /><br />- All the stereo copies of the albums sound MUCH better than the stereo versions of the 1976-1982 especially. That set contains some of my favorite Genesis records, but they really killed those stereo mixes with a ton of compression. In these, sure there is probably some, but the music is still very dynamic.<br /><br />- Having a cleaned up Genesis Live is awesome. I remember an old friend playing me this record on vinyl in the 8th grade, and it was so murky sounding to me that I just couldn't get into it. Now I can.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- I understand, in a way, the decision not to include the 5.1 mixes of Three Sides Live and The Way We Walk, but I'm still a little irked by it. I have no intention of ordering The Movie Box, because 1981 is just about the time in the band's history where I become much less interested. I really love all the 5.1 mixes, so I'm bothered that I can't get those last two live albums on DVD here.<br /><br />- I'm not really sure how bad Peter's vocals on parts of Supper's Ready on the 73 Rainbow Show must have been, but to replace them with mid 90s gruff Peter Gabriel is a) apparent and b) hilarious. There isn't much that old Peter had to overdub, but when it's there, it's silly sounding to me. Just let the thing be a historical document, warts and all. A small issue, but it distracted me for a bit and made the whole live album experience a little less authentic.<br /><br />- Also, even though there is a space for the 2007 When In Rome CD, I have no interest in that item. I saw that tour and I'm not interested in hearing all my favorite songs tuned down a minor third again.<br /><br />That's about it. The mixes are great, and those albums presented in 5.1 (the first 3, and the most important IMO) sound killer. Sure, there are no extras/videos/interviews like on the studio album sets, but that wasn't make or break for me. Recommended very much for big fans and collectors.s authentic.<br /><br />- Also, even though there is a space for the 2007 When In Rome CD, I have no interest in that item.

B000VHMF0A|5.0|This album is a classic and I am happy to have found and purchased it.....Listen and sing along everyday since it arrived.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|all it does is try to get money out of you, don't waste your DL time on it, rip off
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Great app reaaly helps me fall asleep.Some of the sounds I completely understand, but others make no sense at all msybe it's just filler?
B000PEX1IE|5.0|When my 5 year old granddaughter wanted to download this I said, &#34;No.&#34; I thought it was too adult and scary for a 5 year old, but when she started quoting lines and told me there were inappropriate words that she knew she wasn't to repeat, it was clear it was an acceptable movie at home. That being said I purchased and we viewed twice over the weekend. I was pleased that there were no associated nightmares and I was entertained by this blast from the past. The script just seems like one big, extended SNL sketch, but what campy fun. Bill Murray at his dry, deadpan best. The young Dan Akyroid reminded me of a modern day Matt Damon. Love. Plus, although I first balked at the download price tag, so much cheaper and convenient than going to the theater.
0783229526|5.0|The movie is great. Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro are really funny in it. Terry Gilliam is a  fantastic director and  Hunter S. Thompson's writing is amazing. The scene where Depp is typing &#34;We had all the momentum, we were riding the crest of a high and perfect wave&#34; is one the best scenes of any movie i have ever seen!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|about the story days after I read Hopeless. I did not see what was coming.<br />I have recommended this book to family and friends.
B005LAJ17M|4.0|This was a good way to watch this entertaining and interesting TV series because lit was void of commercials.  This is a great series and to watch it without interruption except when you decide made it even better.
0375836675|5.0|This is one of my favourite books.  Markus Zusak became one of my favourite authors after I read this book - some might call it magical realism.<br /><br />This is the story of Ed Kennedy, a taxi driver, who doesn't have much to show for his 19-years.  His life is adrift and average and boring.<br /><br />So it is a wonder that he is caught up in a bank robbery along with his friends, Marv and Ritchie.  In a game of luck, a thief loses his nerve and drops his gun, which Ed ends up getting, along with the praise of all concerned. That is all well and good until Ed receives the first of a number of mystifying playing cards; in his mailbox is the Ace of Diamonds along with a message for him to deliver.<br /><br />So Ed follows a mysterious trail of 12 messages through his otherwise run-of-the-mill town, delivering messages and doing random acts of kindness.<br /><br />This changes simple Ed's life as he is enough of a pure person to be affected by the beauty of people and in their lives.<br /><br />The wonder of Mark Zusak's story is for the reader to discover with Ed, the raw power in delivering messages to complete strangers, and discovering that we are all connected by our insignificant experiences and family relationships. It is something everyone can connect to.  While some could be cynical or mocking of the 12 messages and their pat outcomes, I would say that they embody inventiveness and originality.  There is the thrill of the difficult passage that challenges and takes Ed out of his comfort zone, which moves the story along.  Ed gets threatened physically.  It is all part of the message that there are no easy answers in life, even if you think you are doing someone a good deed.  We are not immune to life even while we may pity someone their lot in life and lend a helping hand. At the end of the day, we have to come back to our own life and our relationships and make the best go of them that we can.  This is a standout book.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|Dear John is such a great book. I would recommend it to anyone. What an interesting book about war, family, and love.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Très bon jeu j'adore, jolies graphismes. Fait bien passer le temps. Ça évolue assez rapidement.<br />Le meilleur que jai pu voir en gestion de ville.
B001BR5NN0|4.0|I watched this movie for the first time ever. I was impressed the only down fall is that it is a little shorter than expected.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|This is a hard game it takes a lot of free time.<br />But dont get me wrong its a fun game.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is just one of my favorite games to play on line so I was happy to see that I get it on my kindel fire
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The creaters of this really did a good job at making this.<br />If you liked temple run one u will like this.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I don't do my e-mail here very often but since I do not have lap top I find that I can check my e-mails when  I am out of town.  I have been using this for about 8 months now..
B000005RU2|5.0|It sounds way better than the original two album set. It was soooo good to listen to all the songs in the live format. My LP copy &#34;died&#34; many, many years ago from overplaying.<br />I espically enjoyed the encores. These were not on the original. &#34;Black Knight&#34; is one of my fav Purple songs.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My granddaughter has this game on her mother's IPAD and wanted me to put it on my kindle. She assured me I would like it and she was right. We have alot of fun playing it together.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It gives you bookmarks and highlighters. Also you have a it of versions to choose from. You able to download them also so when you are off line.
B009X011UQ|4.0|It fit my Kindle Fire perfectly.  The front flap felt a little flimsy at first, but it covers the screen well and the easy elastic strap holds it in place very securely.  it also folds into a nice stand for easy access. It is very light and secure.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|A lot of channels to choose from. You are able to save your favorite songs and channels. Also you can buy songs from the app.
B003O86FMW|3.0|If I could I would give it 2.5 stizzars yo. Katniss annoyed me in this one but it was still a decent read.
B00881VLCE|3.0|This puzzle game is not so great. Pictures for the puzzles are not that great and there is not much of a selection.
B005R32L66|5.0|Very goth working and goth connection Skype<br />  Goth softener , easy for uses , and clearly voes. I am very happy.<br /><br />  Thank,s
B008I43DYU|5.0|This was a great buy. Numbers are big enough to touch without the stylus. Easy to access . I would recommend to buy.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|The is game involves intense but fun strategy. You will spend hours playing and unlocking new plague types and genes. The and add-ons are great too! I recommend this game to everybody!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This book is all information about a dictionary. Are they stupid? This is not a dictionary it is an informational text. Not a dictionary. I would complain to that company for making a book about a dictionary & calling it a dictionary. Seriously calling a book about a dictionary a dictionary. Who does  that? Oh wait it's the people who made this book.Yes I  am complaining about this book. Next time this company needs to put some words and definitions to those words.I`m 12 almost 13 and I know the difference between a dictionary and  an informational book about a dictionary. I may need reading glasses but I know how to tell what types of books without reading it the title with my reading glasses. I would advise you people who make this book do something to make this book a dictionary.
0765324857|5.0|This novel goes in depth to the story behind the recordings found in the games. Recommended to all plot-line fans of the underwater city that is Rapture.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I wish there was a second book to continue the story I don't want it to be over with. But now I  Can't wait for the movie to come out!(:
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy playing games and like solitaire. It's convient to carry the Kindle and read a book of play a game of solitaire when ever I have time.  I do not like all the commercials that pop up.  Very distracting.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Really don't want to say anything to give the book away. But I loved it! Having Christian and Ana become so much closer was the best. And finding out so much about him! What a cliffhanger though... Seems like the third book is going to start out rather interesting :)
B005HSG3VK|1.0|The cover is to small for my Kindle Fire HD.<br />You web site did not offer different sizes.<br />I would like to return the cover, but I do not know how best to do this.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wonderful, devastating book whose first chapters pull the reader though the difficult, emotional journey of a teen girl with cancer. The book is raw and fresh. Worth your weekend.
0345404475|4.0|You can clearly see the inspiration for Bladerunner, but the world is a lot sadder and the main character is a lot less likable than in the movie. The androids themselves engender more sympathy, even though they lack the grand reason for being that they had in the movie. They are simply there, and they're not supposed to be. While the movie ended on a note of hope and redemption, the &#34;hero&#34; of this book has a lot less satisfying ending, leaving the reader with a dreary image of the future.<br /><br />I like the fleshing out of the bounty hunter profession and backstory, the additional androids, and the complexity of the Rachel character as more than a cross-species love interest. I think they could easily make a movie based on this book that follows it more closely than Bladerunner and still be its own movie and a sci-fi hit.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I love the character of Harry Bosch.  You get the sense that you are learning more about this character with each new book.  I like the evolving character of Harry's daughter-she is very def gearing up to folllow in her dad's career footsteps.  I can see an whole new generation of novels based on Harry Bosch's daughter!  Bring it on Mr. Connelly.
0385334206|3.0|I read this based on a recommendation from a work buddy. I've only read Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five, but BoC is basically written in the same style. The main characters are bizarre and the things that happen to them are random and senseless, so it's hard to identify with them. So much of the story is truncated with what I guess is Vonnegut's thing: &#34;and so on.&#34; Parts of the story were humorous, but I'm hard pressed to remember much if anything about this story because it's so senseless and transitory. I recall the central theme of the story made it worth reading, but writing this review 9 months and a few books later, I can't remember what the point of the story is.
B006IYG5HE|3.0|I love the more recent Jo Nesbo novels.  This Harry Hole story seemed a bit too contrived to me.  An entertaining read, but not my favorite Harry Hole novel.  I think Nesbo gets better with each story-and this book is one of his earlier Harry Hole novels.
B007HACDLK|4.0|This was much better than Flynn's last book about Rapp.  There was action, believable subject matter about current events, and showed research about current warfare technology and intelligence.  However, if Flynn is going to continue with his character Rapp, (he's no Corey by DeMille), he needs to crank him up to another level.
B009738XXM|5.0|My daughter loves Call Me Maybe, so when this album when on post Christmas sale, I jumped on it, and I am glad I did.  It has several other really good, fun songs.  I wouldn't say it is &#34;art&#34; but it is a lot of fun!
B00AECGQF2|4.0|I bought the game because all of the good reviews for my little cousins & they ended up liking it since its simple enough to play but before the company made an update it was just four players! Now they added two more characters and therefore I've change my first opinion and I must say it's (now) worth the cost. My cousins are happy playing the game both the boys and the girls so it doesn't bother me as much as it did before that the characters won't even turn around...I expected too much. But at least it makes us laugh from all the silliness of the game which is the only thing that matters to me.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|I found the game to be quite compelling. There is a zoom however you get penalized for using it. This should be addressed. Most of the time I didn't need it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Me and my niece can sit for about an hour just playing this game! She loves it and it's VERY addicting! Would recommend for 6 and up.
B0036G8IQS|5.0|I have dyslexia and bought this book on audible for immersion syncing with the kindle. It is amazing. I got totally sucked into the story and couldn't put it down. I will definitely read the rest of the series.
B005NPCUC8|4.0|It really makes rating an item hard when you can not just select stars and be done without writing war and peace about the item.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This is a great little game! It makes you think and problem solve with adorable little blobs. My only complaint is that I wish there were more levels. It says more to come though, so lets hope it happens soon!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I have had this game since the day it was released for the Android system. I've had to reinstall the game three different times because it would completely glitch out and forget my high score, upgrades, and level. That is super annoying. They definitely need to fix the glitches before it can be a 5 star.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|If you were forced to read \\"the lottery\\" by Shirley Jackson in high school, and after finishing it thought ~ damn that was brilliant and way way to short for such an interesting story!  Well if you did, does Hugh Howey have a story for you. Wool is the best book you have never heard of.  Buy it, enjoy it, and thank me later.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this was definately one of the best games I have ever played that was were you have your own animal. usually it makes me so mad cause it takes forever to load.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Hello I am Booyah reviews and u will see me on reviews more often.From the good reviews i saw i rated 3 stars... i would have rated 5 but its not working! When I press the app it will just show a horse ( the same horse as the app icon) and stay there like it froze... Maybe your having the same problems
B009VB7QQA|1.0|Seriously?? This movie was a true waste of money. Never again will I listen to my kids (or husband) when they give their take in which movies to rent. Thought the movie was a complete waste of time.
B005HSL626|4.0|Hello I am Booyah reviews and u will see me on reviews more often. We will talk about Fruit Ninja. It's not the best game but... it can be fun. It used to be the &quot;popular thing&quot; but now its *bleh*. well its a good game if your just bored on a weekend or after school.<br />BOOYAH REVIEWS ARE ALWAYS RIGHT!!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|lots of sounds to choice from.help me sleep fast.was an awesome app recommend to any one who needs back round noise to sleep at home or on the road.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Hello I am Booyah reviews and u will see me on reviews more often. Draw Something is very fun! The free is awesome too its not different because on full you only get more words but no big deal! Its super addicting and i always like to add a little color to it! Writing is cheating!!! You guys should remember that!<br />BOOYAH REVIEWS ARE ALWAYS RIGHT!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|this app is great for lulling you to sleep or just relaxing to munks chanting.  I find it helpful in lowering my stress levels as well.  great app!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Hello I am Booyah reviews and u will see me on reviews more often. If you are a minecrafter like me you will enjoy Minecraft Pocket Edition! Not such a great price but its so worth it! My friends Nicole and Megan are minecraft maniacs like me! Its great because sometimes you get headaches from strong graphics and i do all the time but this one doesnt! So you should get this app!<br />Booyah Reviews always says the truth!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|i like the game because it teaches you the idea of caring for a horse. and it is vary fun.
B009O5CLZY|1.0|My kids love to play this on my phone so I bought the kindle fire edition...however this version won't work if it can't sync over the internet when it is opened.<br /><br />I'd give it zero stars if I could. Love the game NOT the kindle fire edition!!!
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|I love to read mysteries and unusual suspense stories.  It does keep you interested until the end but the ending was disappointing.  The audio reader was a little slow the accent was a little &#34;corney&#34;.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game. the first temple run was ok but this is GREAT! its fun, Harder; different and super fun.I would delete the first temple run and get this one. hope this helped
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great app. Its solitaire. I haven't had any issues as of yet on my Kindle Fire. Pretty great way to kill time.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I didn't hear much about this movie when it was out in theaters, but now I'm sad I missed it.  It was a very entertaining, visually stunning, and action packed movie.  If you're expecting Citizen Kane, you may be disappointed, but this movie is awesome for what it is: an action movie.  I'll definitely buy it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is awsome and is really cool and extremely fun on.ipads kindles and other tablets but still fun on phone
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Great movie for a family with a wonderful message! Disney has done it again! They always seem to make me cry!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I have been playing this for a while, now.  I went through the whe.game once with the aim to just finish the levels.  Now I am repeating it with the aim of getting the minimum number of moves for each board.  I certainly makes you think about your moves this second time.  Simple, clear presentation and a good puzzle for figuring out sequences of moves
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It is a Great book! I definitely recommend this book! Did not expect the ending! Can't wait to see the movie!
B008PO8PG4|1.0|not at all what I expected, very dissappointed.  Not cheap either ! Bought as a present., so dissappointment all round
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Such an amazing book. I caught my heart racing in fear or full of joy, along with tears flowing when they needed to be. and It felt so real with every detailed description.  The ending was completely unexpected.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|As anticipated great special effects but this story had a tender side that was well played! I would recommend this to anyone!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I like my Facebook  I love Facebook  I like Facebook and my friends<br />I like Facebook I like Facebook I like Facebook
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|play this on the laptop, love any mahjong game<br />easier to paly with a stylus though, would recommend getting one
B0017SWPXY|2.0|Truly a book for dog lovers. I loved the story and Enzo. Loved that DENNY got his daughter back. Enzo was so insightful especially in his description of the Evil Twins. Dog knew so much about people. Truly a wonderful friend. Book was funny ans sad. I truly enjoyed this book
B007N8RULO|4.0|play this on my laptop, now can play it on my Kindle<br />was a free app & easy to play
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Is easy to use can edit and share photos to almost anything. Is useful and is fun to see other photos people post
B00A7CI82I|4.0|Don't let the fact that Matt Damon isn't in this movie keep you from watching or buying it!. It holds up to its predecessors.
B003Z0BWR2|5.0|So far a really good series, can't seem to put the book down. Real enjoyable to read sends you into your own lil world..
B0012HF5NC|5.0|One of my all-time favorite sci-fi movies.  Will Smith is excellent; hilarious yet convincing as a Marine doing all he can to save the Earth's population from annihilation by invading aliens.  Cool special effects and great supporting roles for Jeff Goldblum, Randy Quaid, and, to a lesser degree, Bill Pullman and Mary McDonnell.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|It's fun, keeps you entertained, and keeps you thinking. I'm looking forward for the next game already. I'm recommending this game to my daughter and my sister. :-)
B0086HGW42|5.0|This album is amazing! His voice is so soothing and his lyrics are great.<br /><br />I went to one of his concerts and it was so fun and he sounded amazing. You can tell he's passionate about what he does, live on stage and when you listen to his album. Amazing. My favorite solo male artist, no doubt.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I enjoy playing both temple run games. But now it's causing conflict with both games installed on one device, that's conflict I can deal with. Thanks for the great game.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|keeps you turning the pages at all hours-if you read one book of hers then it turns into a soap opera and i like to keep up on all the characters.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love the game and it is actually like I have my own horse. I am always on this game.
B0076DELIG|5.0|harry bosch is one of my favorite-must be his personality! keep writing and i'll keep reading. i feel like i know him.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I used to try to use the oven timer or just try to remember to go shut off the water or whatever.  With this, I can carry the timer with me, and never overflow the pool again.  Yay!  Works easy, and just right.  I changed the audio indicator to a rairoad crossing sound, so it was even harder to miss.  Love it.  Easy to set time in minutes, or set a specific alarm clock time.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is what great TV entertainment is all about. Thrilling. fast pasted and great character development. Nothing compares to it.
B005H29GSI|5.0|My 5 year old is nuts for angry birds, but i like to limit his screen time as much as possible.  This is an excellent way to get him away from the screen and getting him to build something with his hands.  He LOVES anything that gives him the opportunity to build stuff.  He loves following the patterns laid out by the cards to create the different towers, and he also loves making his own configurations.  We rarely adhere to the actual rules of the game, but no matter, we still have a great time messing with it.<br /><br />Contrary to other reviewers, i found the design to be reasonably solid.  The pieces can stack somewhat precariously, but i think that's the point, as the catapult is challenging to use, so they try to make it a little easier on you.  We're still trying to master the aerodynamics of the yellow bird!<br /><br />All in all, a fun translation of the popular app.  Highly recommended.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Excellent book! This author does not disappoint. It was everything expected and more! The \\"Fifty Shades\\" of Christian Grey's character will leave you breathless and wanting more! Can't wait to read the last of the \\"Fifty Shades Trilogy\\"!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|one of the best games I have ever played. So much harder than the first one. So amazing I had to buy it.
0545265355|5.0|I could hardly put down the books,  and I could see why all the Middle School students were absorbed in them. I love Science Fiction and even though I am a grandparent, I loved reading them.
B002CPMB9O|5.0|But a great film none the less...Densel Washington and Russell Crowe are awesome...a modern gangster story...well written and acted...throughly enjoyed it
B0055SWM08|1.0|I bought this game and it Sucks. it is crap. 99 cents wasted. I thought it was going to be lots of fun. it wasn't at all. it is the most retarded game I have ever played. stupid people made this game. they are fallen trees
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent book. A definite page turner, read in two days. The end was unexpected. So glad there's another book to continue the story.
B00A7ZWUJC|3.0|This album is ok, it's not her best album, in my opinion Diamonds is the best song on the entire album. I probably listen to 3-4 songs on the whole album.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|it's very fun and good. super fun to record and play with when bored. this is super great love it!!
B008EKOO46|4.0|Vintage Jared Diamond. The World Until Yesterday is scholarly, informative, with fascinating anecdotes. Sometimes tedious detail, but otherwise excellent. Really enjoyed it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is the best game ever on my phone never freezes or lags and I'm never going to be bored of it
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|love playing majhong but have sight issues that make most mahjong apps impossible for me to use.  Am able to see the designs on this one though some of the characters are initially difficult to discern.  don't play this as much as other games but will still recommend.
B004UID2LC|4.0|this is super food for watching videos just force closes a lot and doesn't have log in to watch your subscriber  videos
B0000C6K09|5.0|I cannot just help but share how wonderful this purchase was. It relaxes the whole family, brings us back to really good times, and creates a good mood in my home as we just go through our chores.
B0046W5E0Y|4.0|2 year old and 3year old love it, but not their favorite Tink adventure. Definitely holds their attention. But they rematch the other movies more.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|A real page turner. Even though it is over 800 pages long, I finished it in 3 days. Even though it is a work of fiction,if you like history, you will love this.  It brings back memories of how turbulent and violent the 60's were. it also brings back the memories of how simple life was. It was before the really violent times of 9/11 and nuts like the shoe bomber.It reminds us of how simple and fun it was to look forward to taking a plane ride without worrying about all the hassle of planning ahead of which piece of luggage you had to think about where you should pack your nail file (too sharp) or put your hairspray (is it more than an ounce over the required limit). It is unlike any other book Stephen King has ever written.  If you shy away from King because you do not like horror stories please read this.  You will be pleasantly surprised as well as totally enterained.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is very useful to me.  I like the way it announces the battery level at customized intervals, and how it shows the amount of time left to perform various functions before the need to recharge.  Kudos!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I will go to the app and it loads then it brings me back home and there is nothing to do about it and I want to play it right now
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was an outstanding read.  Totally blown away by the ending.  Nicholas Sparks brings you to the edge of your seat.  You just do not want to put the book down.
B009UNGYHG|3.0|Nice Idea - The power connection does not like to stay connected into the case - I had to giggle the power cord to get it to work
0596805888|4.0|This morning my wife and I ate perfectly cooked pancakes and sausage, because as recommended by this book we got an IR thermometer -- a device that measures surface temperatures by sensing the infrared radiation they emit.  So we could keep the skillet temperature between 375F and 400F throughout the cooking time.<br /><br />This book is full of practical tips that I have not seen elsewhere.  For instance, to check your oven thermometer, put a small amount of sugar on some aluminum foil.  Preheat the oven to 350F.  Once the heat has cycled off, put the sugar in the oven and let it sit there for a few minutes -- it might brown slightly but it should not melt.  Now raise the temp to 375F, and soon the sugar should melt and caramelize.  If the sugar melts with the oven set to 350F, or does not melt with the oven set to 375F, then you know your oven temp is not quite correct and you should adjust your settings accordingly.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Just as good as the first. EXCELLENT! The ending gears you up to launch into yhe last book. Can't wait!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Masterpiece Theatre: Jane Eyre is worth all 5 stars because it is by far the best version of Jane Eyre I have seen! This version of Jane Eyre has the most emotion and passion, which is what makes it so great. Many other versions of Jane Eyre lacked emotion and intensity. I would recommend this to anyone who loves Period Dramas and Films.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|good app. it does force close sometimes. but everything except for that the app is good. I love horses too
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book was a little hard to get into the beginning but that was only because I was recovering from reading The Host. But after I got to the 2nd chapter.... I was hooked!
0156030209|1.0|I ordered what was described as a Mass Market Paperback in New Condition. The order was sent out several weeks late, is NOT a Mass Market Paperback, and is anything but new. Looks and smells like it's been sitting in someone's basement for 10 years. I will drop it off at Half Price Books and purchase a new one from a local book store. Shameful lie.
B00AECGQF2|1.0|I don't have this app, but my friend showed me it and it is DISTURBING. they made me try it out, and I did not like it at all. the characters have elongated necks, and freaky features!!! Don't get this app!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Large print and a wonderful app for free, will be used a lot by me. The application has advanced mathematical calculations.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|Ive guessed millions of things. sometimes I was the first one to have that character in mind, but akinator the genie got them any way!!!!! AAAHHHHHH!!!!! I am determined to have one that he wont know!!!!!!!!!
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I like it whenever it includes a lot of stuff in a lot of free stuff in it be a lot of fun
B008EL4YX6|5.0|This app is so much fun!! Its fun to make my own levels and share Thekla's with others who can rate them. :&bull;)  :{)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I read that Sky was only 17 I thought I'd made a mistake my being 38 but I read on and couldn't put the book down. I laughed out loud and cried with Sky. I wish I had a Holder of my own.
B001M4YZ90|4.0|I really like Guy Ritchie movies!  I wasn't too keen on this one right away, but watching it a second time has made it another one of my favorites.  I look forward to the sequel!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Amazingly annoying game.  Fun to play and alot of different varities to choose from.  I like the space one more as it has gravity to deal with.
B00003CXS4|5.0|I really like this movie!  The characters and writing was SO entertaining!  Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro, and the other actors were wonderful!  Fast paced and funny!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Great game, hard to put down at times easy way to learn how to build habitats and to make money.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Great read! I hope Mitch Rapp goes on for as long as Vince Flynn continues to enthrall us with his great writing!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a as big as Xbox edition fan buy application if you don't your a jerk<br />Minecraft is the BEST game ever
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I can't say anything different than all the others who've rated this 5 stars but I just had to rate it so I will be counted in the thousands who have reviewed this book and loved it.  I'm also rating it on behalf of Colleen Hoover who deserves the hugest recognition for such a heart wrenching, emotional, poignant and amazing story... Colleen I don't know where stories like this and Slammed and Point of Retreat come from but you have such a gift and I'm so glad you decided to share it with the world.  READ this book.... you won't be sorry.  I'd rate this higher but unfortunately amazon only gives you 5.  So very good!!!!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Dragonvale is an amazing game. I check this game at least five times a day because it is so fun. I just love to breed cool hybrid dragons and to take care of them. It is so addicting, and it should definitively have more than 5 stars. Great game for people of all ages. If you are having trouble to breed the right Dragon, I suggest that you either buy the Epic Breeding Island, and/or search &quot;Dragonvale breeding guide&quot; online. You also need a WIFI connection for this game.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|The first season of homeland was great. The acting is fabulous! Can't wait for the second season to watch with my husband for date night !!
B008745B32|5.0|It was one of the books you just could not put down.<br />The way the story started out with the war, and captured my attention. All of a sudden, it  changed completely to the perfect ending.<br /><br />This was my first Kindle book and will order more.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Overall, not a bad little game. Only downside is that it doesn't take long to beat. If you enjoy puzzles or games like Myst, you will probably like this game.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Over and over again, there is a virtually endless limit to the 're-play-ability' of this wonderful and eerily realistic game. Five stars all the way! I can't put it down.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I don't know if it's just me or what, but I have signed in several times with this program an every time I try to gain access I have to sign in again! What does it mean? Could be I just don't git it, but life is too short to keep trying to gain access to a program that I'm not even sure will interest me! bored.....
B004UNX1LS|4.0|I think this app is great for people who like music but the bummer is that the videos are blury
B0063IH60K|5.0|always have loved the game solitaire, and this one is no different! in fact, it's way easier to play an re-stack the deck! I find that I use up all my power time on this game an highly recommend it to others!
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I've tried several of the piano apps in the Amazon app store, and \\"Pianist HD\\" stands out as one of my favorites. With so many possible settings and options, the app can be customized to suit almost anyone. The one feature I like most is to play the included musical works at your own tempo and not be forced to follow a bouncing ball or colored lights whizzing by. It makes it a lot more fun for us non-musicians.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I love it, and haven't had any problems with it so far...highly recommend it to any other customers that want to work around the kindle product.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Easy to use.  No problems thus far.<br /><br />I like awakening to the music of my choice from my mp3 library.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|what can I say, I'm already a facebook member so, all had to do was carry my facebook account over to my kindle! how simple was that? highly recommend to anyone an everyone else!
B0027MJU00|5.0|The twists and turns in the plot were awesome.  Just when you think you have it all figured out,  bam, something new is revealed.  You've got to read this book!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 far exceeds the first game and is extremely addicting while staying true to the spirit of the first one.  I love it!!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Really like the brain exercise of analyzing each screen and it's birds.  Also, since time spent can be moments or hours, paused and replay make it versatile for time available or interruptions.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|Best DVD version of the film out there and it shipped promptly.  Double check that you have the 2-disc collector's Edition!
B0054VVRBQ|4.0|Installation: Leaflet tells you to go to Taiwan-based Transcend website into folder /downloads But drivers are very well hidden in Product Family &#34;Card Readers & Accessories&#34;, Product Line &#34;Accessories&#34;, Product Subtype &#34;RDF1&#34;, Part Number &#34;TS-RDF1&#34;. After that download and driver installation went smooth, and card was recognized on first insertion into my Dell d830 running Windows XP.  I expected this product to read/write fast on my SanDisk Extreme SDHC card, which is rated UHS-1 (45 MB/s). The Transcend Express Card Reader (TS-RDF1) gives me 25 MB/s write and read speed. While that still falls short of the possible UHS-1 speed, it is at least passable as a solution for computers lacking USB-3 ports.  Recommended when you're looking for something faster than USB-2 based card readers!  Update 2015-09-20: After upgrading to Win7 (and installing the manufacturers driver) 18 months ago the speed remained the same. However in the last 4 months something changed and now I'm getting only 1 MB/s read speed. I have been unable to pinpoint the cause, but as I hadn't changed anything low-level except installing Windows Updates, at this point I have to assume a Microsoft patch caused the slowdown... :-(  Update 2015-11-08: I finally figured out the &#34;Windows Search&#34; service is messing with transferring photos from SD Card to harddisk. When I stop the &#34;Windows Search&#34; service before copying JPG files from memory card to my harddisk, the transfer speed is 25-30 MB/s again!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I bought the book for a 5 hour plane flight. Loved the book. Stayed up late that night at the hotel reading it. Just saw the movie &#34;Zero Dark 30&#34;, and the assault on the Bin Laden compound was exactly like the book.<br /><br />It is amazing understanding the the training the US Special Forces undergo, both initially, and ongoing. One of the best books I have read in ages.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Love it great very fun. It take a long time to get pass them. I only have 5 more to win. Needs more gamed
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|If you enjoy military history, you will love it. If you don't care anything about military history, you will still love it. A great account of men rising above themselves, and their situation.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game was really fun. I liked all the mini games. Only down fall is i beat it rather quick. For 2&middot;99 it could of lasted longer or maybe could of been a little cheaper.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Excellent book , could not put it down. Makes you want to hike  to experience  all the adventures that the author experienced.

B004FRX0MY|1.0|This app was great at one time. I was able to download all mp3 files directly from amazon to a micro sd card. For some absolute unkown reason they've disabled that function altogether. The limited internal storage of the phone coupled with the brutal data allowances of verizon handcuff the use of this app at all.<br /><br />I loved having quick and easy access to my mp3 files from virtually anywhere, but now find this app almost useless.  Even went as far as uninstalling the app updates to strip it back down to the original version; which actually allowed the files to be saved directly to the sd card, but found that amazon has completely shut down the ability to sign in.<br /><br />In short....a year ago or less this app was a 5-star. Today it's less than zero.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|He thinks they are AMAZING.  He would highly recommend.  Haven't heard anything but great things from him about them.  They were a Christmas gift.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|This movie was good for the action, even though the storyline was out there if you know what I mean. But was caught up in the action and how he was able to work the axe and yet kept it balance. Final line, it was ok.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Tragic, suspenseful and well written. I love the hunger games series by Suzanne Collins. Don't read this book before bed though! :)
B002SQ364Q|5.0|This movie gives a great sense of the feel from that era and the pulse of the landscape in Upstate NY at the time.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|like a mobile pictiionary but needs more work by developers. Not enough words after you've played a lot; no way to delete people who start playing but then quit; no explanation of bomb use limit ; in fact, hardly any explanations Will be a Great and POPULAR game for all ages once bugs are worked out.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Skeptical at first, but willing to try it because it was free. Turns out I was pleasantly surprised. The competitions are starting to become challenging, and all I want now is that stinking rainbow unicorn! This game is definitely worth a look.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is definitely worth the money. Good mix of mini games and engaging plot. I'm looking forward to more.
1451627289|5.0|The story he tells here is different yet still has the same feel and enjoyment of my favorite Stephen King.  Still a mystery as always.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is great for all horse lovrers. I would recommend it to anyone who has the slightest interest. over all it is amazing! although it could be quicker to do competitions.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Always the best, great American classic \\"xxxxxxxxxxxxc. X\\"xxxxxxxxxcccc xxxxxxxxxxxxx \\"xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxcc 9oooooooo x\\"xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxcccc.  Too many words needed for review.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|best game ever I just love this game I love it so much personally if you love horses like I do this is a great game to have
B002GHIPYI|5.0|I have the [[ASIN:B008CS9O8Q Beats Tour In-Ear Headphone (Black)]], [[ASIN:B0007N55NM Sony MDR-XD100 Stereo Headphones]], [[ASIN:B001K3ENEA AKG K 44 Headphones]] and the [[ASIN:B002GHIPYI Superlux HD 681 Dynamic Semi-Open Headphones]]. These are definitly the best pair i´ve ever had, the sound quality is great, they sound a little bright at first. but you have to let them \\"heat their self\\". In two or three days they will sound amazing. BTW they do leak much sound, so no porn with these headphones.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i luv the game its like harder than the first one thats wat i like like like like like about it
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I didn't like the normal temple run, but I like this one!!! It is a little more exciting. It is the same objective but not the exact same. They just added a few more things so over all it is good for when you need something to do!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Wow this game is amazing.if anybody doesn't have this game  I will scream.it is super duper fun and funny game  :-) yay:-) :-) :-D
B00ATPVA78|2.0|I'm stunned that nobody has mentioned the 350MB datafile download that's not mentioned anywhere. I know phones and tablts have GBs of memory these days, but your description only says 13.7MB.  Come on guys, please be honest about things like this.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very helpful in keeping track of how many hours remain for all apps and functions. Plus you can change the colors on the battery so that makes it even more fun!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Awesome book. Sexy, fun and heartwarming! Christian Grey is every girl's fantasy.<br />Great story line with awesome plot twist. Much better writing than the first in the series.
B002ZG974W|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my son-in-law and daughter.  They watch it with their 3 year old over and over and find it to be an excellent film. Not only is it &#34;historically&#34; a fine look at babies the world round, but it is also the kind of film that generates conversation in a family.  My purchase was the Blu-ray version and I ended up having to buy them a blu-ray player to watch it- so make sure you buy the appropriate version.
B00973902K|4.0|Purchased this song so that i could play it for my girlfriend because she loves it so much and she absolutely loves it, the sound quality allows every tone to be heard clearly and crisply (depends on speakers) but also the download was quick and simple
0061122416|5.0|When I heard Will Smith praising this book, I filed that info in the back of my mind somewhere and knew that because he had endorsed it, I wanted to read it.<br /><br />WIll Smith is not only a phenomenal actor, but he is also a great inspirational and motivational speaker as well.  I am happy to announce that I was not disappointed.<br /><br />By the time I was seven, I knew that one day I wanted to be a writer.  When I was seventeen and my father asked, \\"So Lisa what do you want to do with your life?\\" and I said, \\"I want to be a writer\\", it took great courage to admit to a secret truth I feared my family would not appreciate.<br /><br />Again, I was right.  My father's response went something like, \\"A writer? You don't want to be a writer.  You'll never make any money as a writer.  Become a nurse.  People always die.\\"<br /><br />In one swift instant I, like many of the characters spoken about in this book gave up on my dream and tried hard to forget my Personal Legend.<br /><br />In fear of disappointing my father, I entered nursing school only to be told by my English professor that my talents would be waisted as a nurse and that I was born to be a writer.<br /><br />I did not realize it then, but my English professor was put in my path to help me remember my Personal Legend.  Because of my families issues with codependency--it was all too easy for me to not see what was before my very eyes.<br /><br />Three years later, I quit nursing school in my last semester...and never went back.<br /><br />Fast forward about  twenty five years later--and I am now a bestselling author.<br /><br />This book represents much of my own personal trials and tribulations as I set out to fulfill the truest desires of my heart.  The author does an eloquent job at weaving many spiritual, as well as scientific reasonings behind creation and successfully delivers a story worth reading.<br /><br />This story will inspire the desires of anyone's heart to remember that in us all is the coding for our own Personal Legend.<br /><br />I loved this story--and I know you will too...<br /><br />Yes--buy this book...I read it in one afternoon curled up on my couch with a cup of tea...<br /><br />Namaste...ing for our own Personal Legend.<br /><br />I loved this story--and I know you will too...<br /><br />Yes--buy this book...I read it in one afternoon curled up on my couch with a cup of tea...<br /><br />Namaste...
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It was very interesting to learn the meaning behind flowers. I would recommend this to my friends.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I fell in love the first Temple Run and now Temple Run 2 it s just the best game ever
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Definitely allows you to understand the life of a confused teenager…It can be a little difficult to get into at times but certainly worth reading.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is awesome but it takes a while to load and its has awesome pictures. This is a great game don't believe the other peoples review
B005EHQGTS|5.0|Splashtop is the best remote desktop app for Android, PC, and Mac.  It works directly thru your wireless router so you don't see the huge lags that you get with apps that work over the internet, (tho it does have the option to pay to unlock the function that allows you to access your other computers over the internet, but I've not used this feature). It's very easy to set up. All the quick key functions work. The sound and video stream smoothly, unlike the over-the-internet apps which fail due to internet traffic and bandwidth issues.  I love Splashtop and would recommend it to anyone. I'm using Splashtop HD. I paid $9.99 and it's worth the investment.
B000YH6YG8|4.0|An excellent movie, it belongs in everyone's collection!! Some of it may be hard to swallow, probably because of it brutal honesty in it's characterizations.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved this book, even better than the first, \\"Bared to You\\". A lot of excitement from love, jealousy, old flames, and now murder. Many nights I did not want to stop reading, but had fallen asleep from the lack of sleep. Can't wait for the third book!
B004S3MB2U|5.0|This program will do what super computers of a decade or so ago were needed for.  Well, that might be a &#34;slight&#34; exaggeration, but seriously  for 10 bucks plus tax this is an extraordinary product.  Am using it on an Kindle Fire 8.9&#34; HD.  I'll never use all the functions, but it makes math fun again, and it's fun to show off too.  Might even be helpful in getting the grand kids math interests  perked up.<br /><br />Highly recommended even if your math endeavours are limited to balancing the check book.  Might help you learn there's more to math than a check book.  I taught junior high math back in the 60's.  Have long since forgotten how to do many of these computations on paper or blackboard.  This computer program has rekindled some of that flame.<br /><br />If you routinely use 75% of the capabilities of this product, you should be in an income category where $10 is a tip for a well served cup of coffee.
0446554995|1.0|Authors P&C threw everything and the kitchen sink into this shameful mess; I suppose that's easier than using good writing to tell a story. Better to amaze the readers with 21st century Nazis, genetics far advanced from anything known in America today, a great-great uncle who discovered the secret to immortality, Fourth Reich laboratories hidden deep in the South American jungle, the usual blundering law enforcement, spooky old mansions hiding bizarre secrets, unexpected offspring, deviant twins ...<br />Maybe no one will notice a severe lack of storyline and plot. I kept expecting funny-looking aliens from another dimension to make a cameo appearance. The chaotic action and pretentious characters became quickly boring; I lost interest by the third chapter and had to force myself to finish the book.<br />If P&C continue in this vein, I predict their next in the series will involve Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast's wife being dug up by coyotes and reincarnated as the Goddess of Bad Judgement for being unwilling to tell her husband (who has more than his share of weird relatives and is hard to shock) that she's been part of an experiment by a group that, historically, held all the cards once upon a time and still managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, thereby losing a world war.<br />And we're supposed to believe that bunch of failures is not only capable but in the process of redesigning the human race?<br />P&C need to put the kitchen sink back where it belongs and expend some blood, sweat, and tears on good writing, rather than throw a load of crap up in the air and base the book on where it lands.
B006LSZECO|2.0|The characters are not only unbelievable, but totally unlovable as well. The plot is unoriginal and the ending... well there is no real ending. If the author has done this to leave room for a sequel, count me as the gone girl.
B002SEW5WW|5.0|heard a song in the mall playing and called them to find out what the name of it was love this cd
B00AKKS278|4.0|I met Hal at a seminar in Santa Clara,where he spoke of his new book. To be honest I wasn't interested but a friend asked me to read it with her so we could be accountability partners. I<br />Have not adapted to and implemented everything in the miracle morning yet but intend to do so. I enjoyed the book so much I am going to buy copies for my children.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Still have the CD in my car and play it everytime I get in my car very talented woman congrats on the baby
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I think this game is fun but I only got to play it once then after the first time playing it it wont load for some reasion. I suggest don't get it if you have to pay
0345803493|3.0|bought cheap here and sold on Ebay for a profit when it was a hot item never read it heard there is a movie coming out one I will pass on
B00APUQPX6|4.0|Overall the movie was entertaining, but it was not quite as funny as the other two we watched. 3.5 to 4 stars
0345803507|3.0|Did not read them got for a good price and sold them on Ebay for a profit I hear there is a movie coming out oh joy
B007B6VOG0|5.0|To be honest I've spent less time listening to the album in its entirety than I have listening to the first several songs, the singles.  But I love their approach to big, epic sounding music.  The lyricist has a brilliant, instantly recognizable voice.  He's sure to be a contemporary legend.  I'm reminded a little of Queen, and Freddie Mercury,  Can't wait to hear more from these guys.  The music video for Some Nights is also one of the best I've seen recently, in terms of production value and narrative integration.<br /><br />The use of auto-tuning may turn some off, but rest assured it is no crutch.  It's a stylistic choice only, and one used by them in the best possible way, in my opinion.  It gives a postmodern, electronica feel to the music.  It's also in large part.. just a really happy album.  Add any of these songs to your &#34;psych-up&#34; mix and get ready for an awesome night out on the town.  Cheers, Fun.
B000AUD5XY|5.0|I will never get tired of this CD or the movie outstanding on both such a shame about the loss of her she was very talented and a voice that was angelic

0446580848|5.0|This novel has such a ring of truth to it about terrorism. Nothing in this roller-coaster ride seems far-fetched or impossible, given today's headlines  Scary.  My only complaint is that the book ended!
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|Could not get it to download. Tried to down load it 3 times , but still wouldn't work. Uninstalled it.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is one the best temple run having fun using every where people around me loved itt amazon is one of the best place to shop for apps
B00AFROVQC|2.0|I am not sure where all the four and five star reviews are coming from.  Save your money. It has many spelling and editing issues, but the main problem is extreme and illogical behaviour from the characters. Spoilers to follow...<br /><br />As the hero moves through the story, everyone he meets immediately becomes either his enemy or his friend.  On his first day of arriving at the castle, a prince becomes his best friend and the King announces that he is part of the family for saving the life of a knight that is not related to the King.  He is thrown into a dangerous patrol on his second day during which he runs off to rescue one of his \\"enemies\\" without waking his other friends for help and results in his havng to be rescued himself.  For this the King throws a celebration to honor him as a hero where all the experienced battle hardened warriors look at him with admiration. I won't even start on the awkward scenes with the princess.
B005LAII08|5.0|My daughters (ages 4 and 2) absolutely love this movie!!  They were recently sick, and I think we watched it at least a dozen times that week.  Great movie!!
B004UID2LC|1.0|This so called &#34;app&#34; is a total waste of time. I have removed it from my Kindle. It is so much easier to go to you tube direct.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I hate the graphics,they are better on the regular temple run.it's a little hard to control if u have a kindle . If I were u I would not get it even though it's free.but u can still try it.
B000J1AGQI|3.0|I truly felt PLATOON is much more believable.  Im sure the battles where just like what I saw on WE WERE SOLDIERS, its the other things I don't really like about it.  For example:<br /><br />-the reporter guy getting in the battle and he kept talking to the Major (Mel Gibson), I think the Major has MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO!!!!<br />-the reporter guy acted like he was an expert in battles after the battle was over, that's kinda lame!!!<br />-In PLATOON, it wasn't all about religion, it was about staying alive.  Im WE WERE SOLDIERS, there was way too much of guys giving eachother loving/caring looks and religious talk<br />-I doubt in battle its a good idea to not stay down, the Sargent Major stood up the ENTIRE TIME!!!!!  and nobody shot him, WOW is that luck or just dumb Hollywood crap???<br /><br />  In summary, it was a good battle scene and it spoke about families back home and death but I liked PLATOON and FULL METAL JACKET better when it comes to Veatnam War movies.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It really brings together all the unanswered questions of the last two books. It also ends with the answer to who katniss really loves
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game shows you the full responsibility of owning a horse. The more love and compassion given to this creature the more closer your bond will be. The best thing though is you don't just have to have any plain old horse you could also own a unicorn zebra. How rocking is that? Get this game and you'll be entertained for hours .I'm positive!
B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|This is one of my hands-down favorite books of all time. Bill Bryson will appeal to anyone and everyone's reading tastes.
B003F3FJQO|4.0|The beginning is very slow, and it didn't get interesting until I had read half of it. I really liked the book, however, and recommend reading it.
B009MCRHH6|3.0|not enough intro to enjoy the game , but once you get the hang of it not to bad to play
B001DPHDCY|5.0|I think Jim Carrey and Steve Carrell's voices are perfect for these characters.  It's a cute movie that my family enjoys. The price was reasonable on Amazon.
B008L1DNGI|1.0|not for me maybe more for the younger generation, plus to small a graphic for older people eg over 60
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Well written. So enjoyed this book. Colleen did it again. I am a total Dean Holder fan. Loved these characters.
B0063GORYU|4.0|something you can just play when you have a few minutes to kill so I play often while waiting for school kids bus to arrive
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I jave only used the music so far,  and some games,also Scottrade,  all are very good....I will try the movies next and the books.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Cool to a ball of the kindle is a REALLY hope cool work girlfriends that the good work with the gun and
B004H399PI|5.0|Great production and a lot of energy, we think the numbers sound better than the originals.  Phil Collins is amazing and soulful, the back-up singers have great energy, beltin' brass...its got it all.  The bass guitar rhythm from &#34;Papa Was a Rollin' Stone&#34; will replay in your mind for days.  This will take you back to your youth.
B003ODIZL6|2.0|I really like this one that is not responsible for the good news for the first Christmas and the first place for the kindle fire in the first place in the good work with the first Christmas tree of life in your area and the first Christmas and the first Christmas tree of life in the good news for the good news for the good news for the good news for the good news and tomorrow is that it would take to be a way to get to be a REALLY good work with a REALLY nice to be able to get a ball of yarn for a REALLY good reason why you have Hanukkah.i think it was a REALLY good work with the kindle fire master plan for the kindle fire master the kindle fire in your life and the first time since I really like to be able to get a ball of yarn for your shop and tomorrow night at the kindle fire master's lair to be able to get to be a ball.enjoy the kindle fire,master.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I always enjoy Mitch Alboms books and this one is no exception. Highly recommend this book. Love hope and faith always a lesson to learn.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I thought this game would be better than the first one but turns out this is just as bad as the first one. I wouldnt waste my time on this game.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It is very addictive and requires concentration to kept from crossing over the pipes. it is one you can lose time on.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I loved all 3 books in this series! Enjoyed the movie as well. Stieg Larsson is an awesome storyteller. Highly recommend the trilogy!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|It is takes a great deal of concentration and thought. It is very challenging with all the different levels and shapes.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I read it twice! Will probably read it again in a few years! Jodi Picoult is one of my favorite authors!
B008NABUU8|5.0|Basic civil engeneering and it's fun. Building stuff is much more rewarding than blowing stuff up.<br />Easy and flawless install. No issues with playing the game either.
B005413UZ2|5.0|The third album by Jason Pierce's project Spiritualized, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE ARE FLOATING IN SPACE is a therapeutic record, meant to help Pierce get over a doomed relationship and offer some solace to listeners out there. Indeed, the remarkable design of the album, worth carefully admiring before playing the record, has it matching a box of medicinal tablets (the limited edition went one step further by placing each of the 12 tracks on its own individually wrapped disc).<br /><br />The album consists in the main of three types of material: droning rock guitars, grand string or choir arrangements, and free jazz-like jamming. A few tracks are dominated by one particular sound (\\"Come Together\\" the first, \\"Stay with Me\\" by the second, and \\"Cop Shoot Cop\\" by the third). Generally, however, Pierce has created his songs from massive layering of elements that reconcile elements one might consider heterogenous. Underneath the rigid structure of most tracks, there's a guitar or saxophone line that is complete pandemonium. The contribution of the Balanescu Quartet, the London Community Gospel Choir and Dr. John give the album a memorable grandeur, and Pierce merits praise for keeping the tradition of Phil Spector \\"wall of sound\\" production alive.<br /><br />I come back to LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE ARE FLOATING IN SPACE quite often and can recommend it to listeners looking for psychadelic music of recent times.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I'm only half way through but I've gotten to the point where I can't wait to find out what happens next.  I'm excited to finish it.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I'm sure there are a thousand reviews of this novel out there already, so I'm not going to give a book review, per se.  Who am I to critique Victor Hugo, anyway?<br /><br />This is a very readable English translation of a well known classic, well transcribed to digital format, with some active footnoting available.  And it costs $0.00.  What more can you ask?
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|My review is based mostly on Susan Boyle's voice.  She has such a clear voice and she has great control.  She must have been rehearsing for years before she was discovered.  The songs are nice, I especially liked her rendition of &#34;Memories', great job.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book was well written. I had no expectation when<br /> I started reading it but was captivated to continue and glad I did.
B00454U1NS|2.0|Don't get me wrong, I'm not prudish, and I do like Pink's music, hence buying a CD and not just song by song.  That said, I'd only ever heard the tunes on the radio and didn't realize that every song has a curse word in it.  I thought it would be great to have some 'female empowerment' music to play in the car, but no way I can let the kids listen to this.  Disappointed!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game its fun even more than the first. I hope they make a 3rd one also love the zipline!!!!!!!!!!
8866130907|5.0|Great yearly journal.  Nice hard cover with elastic band closure and ribbon for marking your page.  The notes side of the week is a fantastic idea and comes in handy very often.
B001U3Y5XE|4.0|Fun game but a bit challenging for the younger ones. The instructions were a little vague and once you unpack all the pieces the box gets small very fast!
B001GKJ2FW|4.0|I'm not always into musicals, but it is a very good one. Meryl Streep was fabulous as always and I would recommend this movie.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|first off it is very fun and highly origional, but it took away the money I EARNED. after I put the graphics on &quot;best &quot;, I could not open it. it showed me &quot;imangi &quot; and force closed. I had to redownload. now it took away half my coins, AGAIN! I am very irritated. if you choose to get this,  dont put the graphics on &quot;best &quot; and prepare to lose your coins.
B004JZBGWI|3.0|I wish they would make it easier to put in your texts and they need more color variety to choose from.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|awesome and super fun! has new obsticles and different. colored gems and people that you can buy in the store.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like how you can go on ziplines and I like the giant monkey chasing you instead of a bunch of little ones, but too many obstacles
B0076DELIG|5.0|I always enjoy a Harry Bosch novel. The story line is feasible and interesting. It is suspenseful and the plot moves along and maintains my interest.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play it all the time. I love it because you don't have to download the upgrade, it just upgrades it for you.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Just got it and haven't tried it yet, but it's supposed to be better than the first one so I don't see why I wouldn't like it.
B001KVZ6G6|4.0|This is a really good movie, I didn't think that the previews gave it justice, almost didn't go see it on the big screen, but glad I did.  Worth owning
B008AIGWVA|5.0|grandchild liked the free version so I decided to get her the full version and she likes it a lot.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Sometimes it gets a little frustrating, I think they need to give you more birds and more tries, I obviously need it.
B00594XOZU|5.0|got this one for my daughter and she loves it. Now she can chat with people and I can limit her use.
B0086700CM|3.0|I like the second version better and it is really hard to operate on a kindle fire, because you can'[t tilt it as well and it is harder to swipe, than Temple Run 2.
B0086700CM|5.0|My tablet came with this one already on it. It accidentally got removed so I had to have it back.
B008YU0AOE|4.0|It is a basic calculator and it does basic functions, I just wish it had a f to d button.
0307277887|5.0|If you like Dexter, how can you NOT like the books. I still need to get the rest of them but it's definitely going to happen as soon as possible.
0385535147|5.0|If anyone thinks that lawyers never consider how to create and perpetrate crimes, they need to read this one. Even though the character in the story was wronged, he goes way beyond that to extract revenge and make money out of it.  Grisham at his gentle and devious best
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|Had to buy the full version because my grand daughter loved this one so much. it's a must have here.
0446582778|5.0|twists and turns,  Harry Bosch at his best, nail biting, couldn't put it down, Connelly nails it again. Looking forward to more Bosch novels.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it's fun and great for the kids you should get this app. I think they should make a dog one
1455519650|5.0|I'm a big fan of Harry Bosch books by Michael Connelly..especially ever since I became a huge Castle fan and enjoy the episodes in which Connelly is playing poker with Castle
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it so much! It is so addicting and I play it whenever I can! This is also my favorite version! I like the others but this is the best! You should totally try it! So FIVE STAR RATING!
B008EQIK90|4.0|Nothing like the TV series. This was played more for laughs.<br />Watch for special cameos of your favorite original 21 Jump Street TV stars!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|WOULD LOVE TO SHARE ON FACEBOOK TO BE ABLE TO SHARE WITH ALL OF MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY! I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO OWN A HORSE AND THIS APP ALLOWS ME TO DO SO
B005PK553C|2.0|I'm a big fan of horror but this show disappointed me.<br />I was expecting more scariness and chills but it just did not do it for me.<br />Maybe I was expecting too much since it was a TV show and not able to show the shock and gore of a movie.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|Disappointed with this book. I have read the first few chapters and keep putting it down. Can't seem to get into it. Probably will not finish reading it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Beautifully written, addictive, a wonderful primer on the attitudes, history and social structure of the period. Engaging characters with skillful casting.  What TV and movies should be!
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I wasn't sure I would like the &#34;ads&#34; that show up on my Kindle, but if not for the ads, I probably wouldn't try some books that I have ultimately enjoyed.  Night Circus was a book I wouldn't have purchased if not for the ad on my Kindle.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|If you loved Temple Run, you'll love Temple Run 2!! There is a lot more than the first one, and... its just awesome!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved it. It was a great read and I can't wait to read the next one. And I can't wait to see the movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. Keeps you entertained. If you have ever dreamed about owning a horse, than this is the game for you.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is just what i wanted.  it is large enough for easy to read and the &quot;buttons &quot; are large enough for easy use.  i recommend.  besides,  the price is right!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|each time i try to download this it won't download!It takes a long time to be almost done downloading then it fails!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|A great series.  This is the third and final novel of the trilogy and it doesn't slow down.  Action from page one to the last.<br />Stieg Larsson keeps the details coming without weighing the story down.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This is a good, detailed app for weather.  Alerts work great, and the information is plentiful. I got this for my tablet, and it will not orient to landscape view, so it is a bit ackward since I use a keyboard attachment.  Probably great for a phone or smaller tablet.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|I may be biased because I think Deftones can do no wrong, but for some reason it always takes me a couple listens to get into the last two albums.  Poltergeist is my favorite track, and I hope they keep making songs for a long time, Deftones are one of the last alt. metal bands really kicking ass.
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|Once you were lost but now you are found. Great true story. great music, Great film making and a lesson in humility.
B009GQ57ES|4.0|I liked the album and always hope that these types of artists will make it to the mainstream and be heard more.  Even though the writing is smart and the rapping is well rounded and not dull, somehow the tracks lack a bite and sharpness.  Thrift shop is funny and the beat is fun but listeners hear funny songs and forget them because they do not effect you and stay with you.  Other songs take on more heavy issues but never make you cringe or really question anything.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have never been the kind of person who enjoys reading \\"literary porn\\", so when everyone was talking about these books I really wasn't all that interested.. Now that I have read the first and second books, I am enraptured! James has made a believer out of me, and I cannot wait to finish the trilogy and read all the other books that I have so quickly misjudged in the past.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|Born to die was a fantastic album and left me wanting more, so when ride came out I was really looking forward to the follow-up.  The sultry voice and provocative lyrics make for a hypnotizing duo, leaving you needing to hear the songs over and over.  I can listen to the album the whole way through without having to skip songs and those kind of albums are few and far between.
B006H5120E|5.0|Titanic is one of the biggest movies off all time and see it on HD and 3d is just  breathtaking, the sharpness the sound and the 3d its amazing, felt like in the cinema in 1997 but bigger, it becomes one of my favorite movies realeased on blu ray.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Everything about this book was amazing. I loved all of the characters and how they were all perfectly flawed. The way the story and the suspense unfolds, a little at a time, was absolute perfection. Dean and Sky have an undeniable connection and I couldnt read the book fast enough to figure out the reason behind that. I laughed, I cried. I was mad, I was happy. This book was unbelievable good. I'll definitely re-read one day.
B005TQACLC|5.0|Britney Spears looks hotter than ever,  feminine, stronger, sexier and a true women, if one pop star has the power to surprise us in every single show that is miss Britney Spears.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|\\"Trouble with the Curve\\" is Clint at his best<br /><br />This along with \\"Gran Torino\\" are the best Clint Eastwood movies ever!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I could not put this book down. Not a dull moment, always interesting and/or exciting. Very well written and eye opening.
B0012FB2MW|4.0|Some songs better than others, but all are good. IMHO, funkiest white boys to come out of England fo sho.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is great for kids and adults there is a lot jumping and sliding and exploring it is a great game you should by this app
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is a must read!! I found myself rooting for the characters.. frustrated when Abby kept making the same old mistakes & refused to acknowledge what was right in front of her eyes. It held me captivated. I am immediately buying Jamie McGuire's other books! Hope they don't disappoint.
B009O2XY12|4.0|Easy to play when you want to keep your mind going. My grandkids will love playing with this one, especially knowing they love playing with Grandma's electronic toys.
B009IF82SK|4.0|Very well-written and well-acted comedy series. The writing is as strong as ever in season six, as are the laughs.<br /><br />The number of quotable lines (and T-shirt slogans) grows.
B007W7P5L8|4.0|I saw one after I had ordered this one and I like it better. It covered the sides of the kindle and I think it would protect it better.
B00785P2QC|2.0|Guaranteed crash+won't load after Trash Compactor goal completion... have to Force Close it + Clear both Cache &amp; Data before attempting to re-launch the APP /  GAME. This =clearing= resets you back to square one, so do NOT bother making any ''real money'' purchases until this (and more) is fixed. Aside from the additional restriction of this APP/ GAME using Energy *sigh*, it is at least as entertaining as Virtual City.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love playing this game.....very exciting!<br />It sometimes really makes you think.  I try to get groups of five so I get the magic ball!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy the game is just don't like the pop up ads. I like the fact that it was free.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|just play it you will be surprised on how fun this is. and if you don't like it just delete it but there's a small chance of doinfg that
B000W93CHC|5.0|This is one of those books you don't want to put down when you start reading.  Follett writes in a manner that puts you in the story.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Just got this game and found it to be really fun. I definitely recommend it for anyone who wants a good puzzle game.
B0053O89JM|5.0|My husband loves House. This is a great series, I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys watching the House series.
B004Y042N8|5.0|I love this game. Most of the screens are challenging and you aren't tied up for a long time playing a game.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I can't wait to start book number two. This book had me making time to sit down & read. Excellent.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|the horse gas energy, once it runs out u cant do anything till it refills. otherwise its really fun and will keep u busy.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I have to think my household isn't the only one with multiple kindles. I say that bc maybe that the issue.  My daughter and I are experiencing this. I collect 2000 while she gets 5000. We got to bed and the next day she's got 1000 and I have 350. Likely a game circle issue not tested when porting app to Amazon platform. Glad we did not have to pay.<br /><br />update Jan 27. started the day with 2300 coins and after one run I now suddenly have 230 coins. wtf?  glitchy app. deleting now.
B007P4OTHO|5.0|A wonderful reissue of the first ALBUM I ever bought.. and by all means , follow the request on the lower left corner of the rear cover!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Omg this is an awesome book. Romance, sex, and unpredictable. I love this book, I could never put it down! I can't wait to read the next book. Will definitely recommend it!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Very much enjoyed this thinking-person's game, after getting over the squeamish-feelings of annihilating all of humankind.  Unlike some other strategy-type game apps, this one provides a nice balance between time-pressure and the development of a personal strategy.<br /><br />As a female, I'm not at all into games where the objective is simply to kill, maim, and destroy. So, being afforded the chance to engage my intellect while formulating an ever-evolving game plan is both fun and refreshing.<br /><br />With so many choices to make  from start to finish, Plague, Inc. is both \\"deep\\" and stimulating. Will keep you engaged and intrigued for hours... all for a mere $.99!<br /><br />-C.C.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|THE BONE BED -- Her books are always interesting, exciting and a fast read.  Hard to put down.  I recommend it.
1601254679|5.0|This book is pure magic. My DM loves it. It is also great for a player to see a little of what is possible.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another winner by Nicholas Sparks.  His stories really touch the heart.  I want to see the movie now.  This was an excellent book.  Recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I honestly like the game it's just that it's kind of copying temple run. I mean it is good but wouldn't you what a game that's original?
B0010T0OCY|4.0|A new approach as far as I know in the \\"we are being controlled\\" genre. Fresh enough to seem new. Entertaining.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|:D This game is so much fun! A great way to waste a few minutes at a time trying to whack at the fruit, dodge the bombs and unlock new weapons and backgrounds.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is the kind of game I really love - great story without too much talking to slow you down. Very creative, complex play. Taps and zooming work well.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I was out of town, so I was so happy to discover that  I could access my Facebook account on my Kendle.  It kept me in contact with my friends while I was gone without getting on a computer.  I'm a senior citizen and am technically challenged, so I don't have a smart phone.  I love that I can use my Kendle.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my daughter loves this game! the only downfall is that you cant name your own horse . everyone begins as &quot;beauty &quot;
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I bought it when it was first offered!  It didn't arrive until after Christmas, so I wasn't home when it came.  I have it in my car CD player and I enjoy listening to it.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|Very pleased with this Malware case for my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\" purchased through Amazon. It's attractive, protects effectively and works efficiently.
B000H30B2C|4.0|I love anything directed by Peter Jackson and I decided to give Jack Black movies as a christmas gift.  King Kong was a perfect gift,as it fit both my requirements.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|So convenient &amp; easy to use as a shopper.  I have no camera on my Kindle  to upload  photos, so selling on here is impossible,  but if you use your Android phone app, selling is so fast &amp; easy..
B002BI6SMI|4.0|I recently saw Taken 2, so I bought Taken after seeing it and really enjoyed it.  This time, I bought it for a friend who is a Liam Neeson fan.  I know she will love this movie too.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this games is fun and educational. it teaches you how to train and care for your own horse. it also has these games were u can compete and last of all some minigames that will make your horse happy
B000T433CO|4.0|I had seen it several times.  I love the cast, so I thought it would make a great Christmas presant.  To me it is a Christmas Classic and I reccommed it as a gift for those you don't know what to get.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I loved the format and really being able to see the timeline of events. Charlie is so relatable for me, and in some ways, I felt as though I was reading about myself. I wish I knew more people who understand the way that Charlie does, even if he does cry too much. This story touched me to the core, and I think everyone should give it a chance. It is my favorite, because it the last one I read.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This year I bought DVD's as Christmas presants.  I choose Love Actually because it is one of my favorite movies of all time.  It has a wonderful cast and is really enjoyable.

B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Good modern take on the classic Dr. Who of the 70s. Enjoyable, fun and ..well british! Check it out now
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book got me hooked to continue reading book 2 and 3. This one is my absolute favorite. I read this one the fastest. It was so captivating.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|the game is good.  its just that after playing it a few times it wont open. also very addicting. I would play it for hours if it would open.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was not a book I would have normally read but I kept hearing everybody talk about it so I figured I would see what the big fuss was about and it was very good. My favorite is still book one though! I am currently on book three and have not been able to finish because of work.
B007KOLNXC|3.0|Story line seemed strained at times.  While there were interesting character twists we didn't think the development of certain key subplots (eg Lane's issues) was very strong.
B008M721MS|5.0|It's so great to reach out & see those that are to far away....<br />We shall be using it very often!!
B001NHNG64|5.0|Liked the book a great deal.  Keep you in suspense through the entire read<br />  Would recommend it to anyone that likes military suspense.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I wish I could apply what I read here. It was very good and I loved the illustrations. I would like a reader's guide to  understand even more.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I would like to ride the horse and actually clean thing. overall its okay. I also would like for you to be allowed to name your 1st horse.
159448385X|4.0|This is a moving story.  It was read as a book club selection.  The relationship between the two women is strong & sad.  Well-written & a good read.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I always am on this app checking to see what the weather is going to nice like for the day and also up coming week, so I know how to dress or what to do. App works wel and is easy to navigate. It has up to the minute weather and advisories.
0811821846|4.0|My 4 yr. old loves to look at the pictures.  We used some recipes for his birthday this year.  Pretty simple stuff, with fun names, basically.  I recommend.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really didn't know about this book until my friend told me about it,but may I just say...bravo Stephen Chbosky.you have  outdone yourself.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|I love this movie.  WW2, Brad Pitt, Guns, & making history into something a little more satisfying.  I recommend this movie.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|great cast!<br /> twisted plots!<br /> I can' t believe this is shown on regular tv and that<br />some of this passed tv sensors but I love it!
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Loved it!  Made me think about watching baseball with my dad.  Clint Eastwood, Justin Timberlake, and Amy Adams are fantastic
B006O3MU96|4.0|This was added by one of my grandchildren.  I never really had a chance to play it.  I guess I will.
B0076DELIG|4.0|this is one of our (wife and i) favorite authors. theme kekt you guessing about the bad guys. more about non funcitional police depts. would help.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is an amazing game. No, wait its MEGA AWESOME TIMES INFINITY! Temple Run 2 has better graphics and ziplines, whoa now that 's the definition of MEGA AWESOME TIMES INFINITY.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Slightly generic story but nice writing, cute chemistry and of course, the happy ending. If only this were truly real life ;p
B005HSG3U6|4.0|... only thing is that the groove where the folded cover fits to form the stand/base slips easily, making it easy to knock over. but it is grippy to hold for reading and the elastic strap is easy to secure or open. Great case for the price!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game! I wish invest points were offered more often for completing jobs instead of energy<br />but still I love it!
B0058VW36U|5.0|... it starts to demand a lot of creative problem solving. As you advance, some of the challenges are really funny.
0440245931|2.0|This is a \\"guy\\" book.<br />A divorced 46 yr. old Law Professor is dating his female law student, who just happens to be the smartest, prettiest, \\"long-legged\\" sexiest thing you've ever seen.  AND ... she's ONLY 24!  Not only is she as smart as Albert Einstein and sexier than Jenna Jameson, but she can write a brief (the Pelican brief) faster and better than Perry Mason .. or uhhh Alan Dershowitz, or Gerry Spence?  And, OMG!  Did I tell you, she can solve a crime quicker than the FBI and the CIA put together?<br />Oh pull-eeze!<br />First of all, if I were that girl (Darby Shaw), I sure wouldn't be going out with an ALCOHOLIC professor old enuf to be my father.<br />Why would I, if I'm .. \\"all that\\" ..? Sure, I like to \\"eat out\\" and although, they \\"never went out to the same restaurant twice\\" -- it was always \\"dutch\\".  Dutch?  L*rdy!  Callahan was old AND cheap.  Oh well ... he DID have a porsche.  BTW, I love porsches.<br />I must admit, I WAS sorry when the car blew up.<br />I almost got to 40% on my Kindle, when I decided \\"this ain't real interesting\\".<br />The characters are ruthless and shallow; people I wouldn't care about.<br />Some might call this a \\"political thriller\\", but since I don't like politicians nor politics in general, this book could not pique my interest.<br />This was the first Grisham book I've attempted.  I understand there are better ones out there.<br />I HOPE so.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|My wife and my daughter play against each other on separate tablets... in the same room. Sad but fun...pay extra for more colors.
B0086700CM|5.0|I first started playing this on my Samsung Galaxy S3 Android phone.  I quickly got addicted to it, but very often it seemed that the processing power couldn't keep up and the game would stutter a bit, and then it wouldn't recognize one of my swipes, and that would cause me to lose the game.  I haven't had that happen on the Kindle Fire, so I play more on the Kindle now.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|it was so bad, i had to force myself to finish it. have no interest in books 2 & 3
0071636080|5.0|Gallo's insights into what produced Jobs' &#34;magic&#34; is spot on.  I have enjoyed this book and have implemented some of what I have learned from it into my own presentation style.  Results are evident on the faces of my audiences.  Recommended.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I LOVE this show!! I hope that they keep the American horror story series going.. Each year it gets better and the actors and actresses are awesome! This show is unlike any other and I am a horror movie freak!! Seeing it is worth every penny!!!
B004SEUJVO|5.0|Everyone has had one.  The job that they really did not want, but took nonetheless.  This is by the same group who made movies like Superbad, Knocked up, etc.  It is not a traditional comedy however.  It is a combination coming of age, romance, some comedy and even some drama.  Jesse Eisenberg's character is stuck having to get a summer job at an amusement part when his plans to take a summer trip to Europe before starting school.  While there he falls for Kristen Stewart's character, and the story eventually follows their relationship.<br /><br />The acting in the movie is top notch.  Even Kristen Stewart who has a tendency to be very wooden and monotone does a good job.  Bill Hader and Kristen Wig are great in their roles, as do the rest of the cast.  The film is set in the late 80s so those who grew up at that time will also appreciate the soundtrack as they came up with a lot of old 80s songs that will bring back memories for those old enough to remember that time.<br /><br />The movie looks and sounds great on Blu Ray, although it is not really the kind of movie that you necessarily get that much more on Blu Ray as opposed to DVD.  If you are into coming of age movies, this one is definitely worth a look as long as you do not expect Superbad or American Pie level comedy.
B005Z9MH98|5.0|I truly enjoyed this movie and plan on purchasing more items from Amazon.com in the near future.  Before seeing this movie I had no idea that it was a true story to most of its content.  I do enjoy Matthew Brodrick and most of the movies he has played in.
B006O3MU96|4.0|I added this free video game to my Kindle Fire.  This is a fun game to play and actually can be addictive.  A good game for all ages.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I am not a big fb fan.  I do go on and see how friends and are doing and that its
1481251880|5.0|I picked this book out because of its 4.5 stars review. I thought, after reading a few chapters, that the book was a pretty good read with likable characters, but didn't understand why the rating was so high...then until I reached to about 60% of the book. The surprising twist literally took my breath away. The story got so intense and gripping that I couldn't put the book down and was crying at the end. The great thing about the book was, all the details were very well tied together. You can look back and see how all the events were linked and how Sky and Holder became who they were. The last chapter was a brilliant ending to wrap the whole story together. Loved it.
B00127RAJY|3.0|It defintiely makes you sweat and loose weight, but I needed to put it on mute, her voice is annoying and she constantly sounds like she is yelling.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|I downloaded this for on my tablet for my 4 year old and she can't get enough. I love how realistic the cooking process is because she has actually been able to do some of it in real life when helping with dinner.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I've only had this game for 20minutes and I love it! The only thing I don't like is if you want to get free gems you have to download stuff or do stuff that has to do with companies and I don't mess with that stuff. It is realistic too. If you don't have a horse and you can't get one then this is as close as you're going to get. :D
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Fun game just wish would earn peanuts in gameplay. why must we have to pay money to play? other then the peanuts I like this game.
B000YI7MRM|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  Good setup of the characters and great acting.  Highly recommend this movie for the adventure loving moving fans.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love this game better graphics better gaming the only problem is is that I am loosing money but I don't know how otherwise great game.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|After ya get through the first film its smooth sailing from their. This is great for a person that doesn't have time to read the books and still wants the message to sink in while having fun! The price is beyond great, ended up being less then $4 per movie for me, what a deal! I've seen them all and I'm re-watching them all with a person that hasen't seen them all and its been enjoyable. Great gift too!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really like playing this game and it really is a lot of fun, but it takes almost 15 min. for the game to even start up! Fix this and I'll rate it 5 stars, but for now the app only gets 4, because it truely is incredible.
B004HD61KE|5.0|I love being taken along on the story and this book took me all over. So intriguing! I now have a whole list of subjects never before considered that I want to learn more about. Wonderful book. Highly recommended.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this app is cool you should play it buy be careful this game once you start you cant stop .if i could play this game all day I would.  this game is great you should play it.if I would have to play this bane all day as a job it would be my dream job.trust me its a great game just play it and you will love it.

B009M1QRM8|5.0|I have read all the Agent Pendergast novels and found this one as intriguing as usual. i hope this is not The last in the series.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book over the rest. The entire series was better than the movies. The books made the movies better. Beautiful ending.
B00062PN6I|5.0|A durable headphone at a amazing price. I still got mine for a month now and still going great. These headphones are a keeper.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I would recommend this alarm clock to anyone.  The numbers are big and bright enough to see the time . Very pleased with it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book because it talked about a lot of things that other books would not touch on such as sex, drugs, and gays. Through the letter format, I was able to connect closely with Charlie and think of him as a friend. Unconventional topics are used to portray the theme of growing up and finding ones self. It opens your eyes to the world around you and makes you want to be a better person. I would recommend this to anyone who wants an unconventional, but good read.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|Bought the kindle fire and it fit into the zip sleeve nicely with room to spare.  It also protects the kindle well.  I would recommend for the kindle fire (the HD kindle fire did not fit into it).
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Product lets me know how much time I have left for reading or playing games.  East to use.  Very useful.
B005LAIIJY|4.0|\\"Django Unchained\\" is Quentin Tarantino's homage to the spaghetti Westerns he grew up with.  It is a classic revenge tale packaged for modern Western political sensibilities:  A runaway slave partners with a German bounty hunter to rescue the slave's wife from the clutches of an evil plantation owner who is despicably violent and worse has really bad teeth.  It's a film that ought to be satisfying to watch, and indeed it is.  And it ought to be a film in which violence feels good, and it does but not without leaving a sour taste in the viewer's mouth (in light of all the recent mass shootings in America).<br /><br />I think the film does not implode into senseless violence mainly because of the romanticism and chivalry of the German bounty hunter, played brilliantly by Christoph Waltz, who played the villain bone-chillingly brilliantly in Tarantino's \\"Inglorious Basterds.\\"  Waltz, who has made a small fortune for himself shooting down violent despicable men in the most violently despicable manner (he kills a sheriff in front of the townspeople who elected him, and he guns down a farmer in front of the farmer's son) decides to help Django rescue his wife Bromhilda because the name conjures up for him the legend of Siegfried, and he's determined to help this black Siegfried rescued his beloved from the hell in which she's imprisoned.  That's why when he ultimately dies defending his romantic and chivalrous notions of justice and honor it feels gratuitous and unworthy.<br /><br />There's something raw and exciting about Tarantino's film-making, but perhaps his film-making is too raw and exciting.  He perhaps lacks the intellectual capacity, rigour, and discipline to turn his films into something more refined and everlasting.  That's certainly the problem with his latest creation.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Loved loved these books. sucks that I have to wait a really really long time to find out the very end. :(
B008X9Z37A|5.0|I would recommend the Belkin Classic Case for anyone who would protect their Kindle Fire from the elements, dust or spills.
B0064W652A|5.0|So back in the day my brother worked at a comic shop. He wasn't payed but he got store credit. And believe me, Store credit was more precious than any form of salary to him. He would read comics all day at work then come home and read more. He was extremely fascinated with the dark knight. He would give me the run down on what was going on in each series he was reading. And in a way he would theory craft what would happen next. I would play along with him and to me it was just that... a game. But for him it was his passion.<br /><br />7 years ago for some reason he decided to take his life. It devastated  our family and still continues too. Not a day goes by where I don't think of him or the Times we spent together.<br /><br /> For Christmas this year I received a kindle fire hd. Scrolling through the books I immediately locked In on \\"hush\\" . So many memories sparked In my brain and it was a definite buy for me.<br /><br />The story was amazing. Every page filled with awesome artwork and colors that completely set the tone. From old villains to catwoman looking so seductive, from the twists and turns and brutal past to the beauty of a love story intertwined in such chaos.<br /><br /> Each twist and turn had me smiling just thinking of the time he probably spent trying to dissect the story and predict what was to come. Paying so much attention To the minor details. This story is more than a story for me. It's precious memories and thoughts of my brother being reawakened and relived<br /><br /> And I loved every minute of it!
B008ZOHCKE|3.0|Just wish there were more choices for cover design & color, as well as the fonts actually coordinating to the lines. But overall, it's a good app.
