B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|This is a very good movie that  brings to light some things most of us would never even think about....and rarely could imagine. It gives a whole new perspective on disability AND sex, and does it in an effective and loving manner.  Cast is remarkable. Helen Hunt is a brave woman.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|I am really enjoying the Lost series DVD's. Too bad its only 6 seasons! Too bad its only six seasons.
B00003CX8N|5.0|Once again, life proves to be vastly more interesting than anything that we can make up. What a beautiful telling of a true story, and lives that crossed from across the pond. If you like books, if you like England, if you like reality, you'll like this story.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Those ads are very annoying. I love the game, but it glitches when I x out of an ad and I often have to go and open the game again. And who would want to buy those carnival games? GET RID OF THE ADS.
B008JFUUIA|4.0|It is nice to see a modern day movie in which there is singing.  It will never be a musical but you go away feeling good and some of the actors can really sing.  There were a few scenes that I did not thing were necessary but overall I really liked the movie.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I liked everyone in this movie...so it was a triumph for me.  I've actually ended up with quite a library of works by Judy Dench.<br />I love English movies/tv ....the English don't mind their characters ageing naturally and their actors/stars not being picture perfect.  We could learn ALOT from the English in this area.  I also love their sense of humor.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game it is so fun just building and creating. I just lobby it so as you like this game please get it it is so fun
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I'VE READ MANY OF DEMILLE'S BOOKS, AND ENJOYED THEM, AS I DID THIS ONE. IT JUST WASN'T THE BEST OF THE BUNCH, BUT A GOOD READ AND, IF YOU ENJOY JOHN COREY'S HUMOR, YOU'LL BE OK WITH THIS.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My son loves this game. It's so fun to hear him laugh so loud when the player he's playing runs into the bus. Lol Yes, I know. Really?!? But it's fun for him and I love to hear him laugh. Cool game.
0385751532|4.0|This book is also great for a holocaust unit.  The story tells about life in the concentration camps and outside.  I would recommend this to anyone doing a unit on the holocaust.
B00B99KJR0|1.0|I was so excited to see a new game from Playrix. I have downloaded this game 4 times and it still wont install. Restarted my Kindle Fire twice and still got an error upon trying to install. Please fix because I would so love to play this!
B00BB8PWSK|5.0|This movie is one of those that just totally satisfies your funny bone. I was very intertained with the whole thing.
B0090SI3ZW|5.0|My husband and I both loved the movie by RZA. A lot of action. Can't wait to see if RZA puts out any more movies.
B0030F5W5K|5.0|this movie is one of those movies that you just have to see at least once a year. Always a joy to watch
B0011Z31V8|5.0|Great songs for a great price. Love the amazon album deals! I will definitely keep my eye on other deals like this.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I can get to my emails a lot easier and faster.  It is also a lot easier to download attachments.
B002X3V4P2|4.0|Great songs for a great price. Love the amazon album deals! I will definitely keep my eye on other deals like this.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|This App is not what i thought it would be.  I don't really have a need for it and probably should have read the description better.
B008GAXUYE|5.0|This box set is a true tribute to Brilliant Classics. The packaging is adequate. The labeling is very good. The recording quality is first rate. The sampling of the composer's music is representative and comprehensive. Needless to say the cost is a bargain. If you are new to classical music and you want a great introduction to good Russian music, this is perhaps the best available place to start. If you are a devotee of classical music, this box set ought to make a very welcome addition to yours and to any collection of fine music.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|A short book, but very well laid out, with common sense suggestions on communicating with new people.  A helpful book for those of us who are uncomfortable in social situations.<br /><br />This book would also be useful for a manager to use as a primer for employees in customer service industries.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I would recommend this game.  Very addictive and fun.  I have only had it for about a week but really enjoy it and I think others would too.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|THIS IS REALLY GOOD APP. GREAT TO CHECK OUT WHAT TO EXPECT FOR THE DAY IN THE MORNING. TRY IT!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Best of this genre I have played from any vendor.  Detailed and challenging it is also quite long.  Highly recommended.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|i PLAYED FOR AWHILE THEN RAN OUT OF FREE COINS, U EITHER  WAIT FOR MORE TO ACCUMULATE OR BUY MORE, DONT WANT TO HAVE TO KEEP BUYINGCOINS!1
B000003BZ4|5.0|I've followed Govt Mule ever since this first album came out and I have the cd somewhere in this house,this trio kicks ass with each song from beginning to end,Warren's soulful voice and and searing guitar solos really make this album come alive. My only wish is that Amazon make this album available as a download so I can put all these great tracks on my iphone. It doesn't get much better than this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so cool. You always get a new mission and new tasks in addition to that you get upgrades and new characters in the shop with the coins that you previously collected. So it's a buy for me
B00ABXA1HI|1.0|I could not get the APp to work properly with my dessktop. The next time I downloaded on  my new Mobile device it wanted me to pay for it!  What a bait and hook KInda App company are you!  Have a nice Splashtop Day! Opps make that 2!<br /><br />Thanks
B0083Z614S|5.0|This is a wonderful story of hope, joy, learning and discover. The characters seem to leap off the page and draw the reader right into the. Misrepresents manor setting and into the secret garden itself.  This is a wonderful book for young and old alike.  It teaches children to have faith and reminds adults of what it means to have the faith of a child.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|I really enjoyed both books..... however I am SEVERALLY DISAPPOINTED at the authors release date for the third book.  The only reason I started this series is because after reading the second book in August I only had to wait till December for the third.  Then she changed it March , now I think its June.  At this point I dont even want to read the next book.  I think she did this so people would read her earlier books !!!!!!!
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|I read the other reviews and feel sorry for the customers that didn't like this.  They lack all sense of musical criticism and should be omitted from the \\"Review\\" section.  This CD was fantastic!  This is a collection must have!  Hendrix sounded innocent and not produced.  I usually listen to bands \\"live\\" to judge their musical talent before I listen to their studio product because it gives me a realistic view on their talent and on what the musicians are all about.  This album made you feel like you were there with Hendrix live (this is not a live album where you hear crowds of people, this is more or less of a candid Hendrix experience).  These are the kind of albums we all wait for to be released.  Do not hesitate on buying this...overall the quality of the sound is perfect for what this CD is all about!<br />MIFF
B004SIIBGU|4.0|it was not fast in development for the kindle fire but thhey got it right and there are no bugs
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A book I couldn't put down and kept thinking about after I finished it. Two people who saved each other, what a great love story.
0895292211|5.0|It's thrilling to find this gem!  A life changing read!  It's difficult to imagine this being written in 1985 and not be common knowledge for all to benefit!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I love this ap.  Easy to use, and I found all kinds of radio stations locally and globally to listen to.  Very nice.  I can listen to NPR anytime I want!
B00ATU5JRA|1.0|oF COURSE IT WOULD ILLEGAL TO DO THIS ... I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THIS BEFORE I DOWNLOADED THIS TO TRY TO RECOVER MY PASSWORD.  SO I'M STUPID TOO.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I got the free version of this.  Other than having to skip an advertisement each time you deal, its great.  I love the sound of the cards shuffling, and especially love it when you win and the cards dance around.  Great.
B0050DZ8J0|2.0|The app worked on my phone, but everytime I sign in to the web LinkedIn pops up on a tab. Haven't figured out how to make that stop. So I deleted the app. Very annoying.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It says its Facebook and it is.  I got this Ap for my new Kindle Fire.  Works great.  Page looks a bit different than my computer, but its facebook
B00APJLX8E|5.0|Our whole family loved this, from grandparents and aunts and uncles to parents and children. I think there was barely a time where there weren't giggles or laughter. This made for a wonderful family night film, and helped us also to open up discussions with our kids on how discrimination is bad in any case. We also had a fun discussion about how parents have to learn to let go when it is the proper time, but also how children need to show respect and patience, too!
B009LXEBD4|4.0|Purchased this for my daughters, as b/c it had popular songs and KC doesn't seem to get in to the sex oriented songs that plague the radio airwave's now days.<br /><br />She also doesn't slink around in partial clothing, so if one of them watches a video, they won't be shocked at what they see.<br /><br />Overall, her songs are strong and to the point.  would recommend.
B009VB7QQA|5.0|My husband and I both dearly love almost anything Steampunk, Vampiric, and Historic. Oh look! This hit all three! What a fun alternate history! It was wonderful to watch the fighting and listen to a lot of tongue in cheek witty banter. We also loved the sensitive parts, and how the writers dealt with turning this into a &#34;realistic&#34; fantasy. Well done, writers!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|its an epic game that i could spend hours playing, best app ive owned so far thnx for a great free game
B00BETX5PS|5.0|My husband and I have 4 kids, so it's pretty hard to find baby sitters. This was a FANTASTIC night in, especially since we're both Bond fans! The return to the classic, suave, sophisticated Bond from the gritty, low-brow stuff was a total sigh of relief from both of us. We loved the music (Yay Adele!) and loved the movie. Can't wait til the next one!
B00A5052YE|5.0|\\"As many people who know me know, I am a dedicated Alicia Keys fan. I don't know her personally, but I know that she is brilliant--a musical genius. And from what I do know of her through what she portrays in her music, as well as her philanthropic quests and undertakings, I can only believe that she is a classic diamond in the rough.  My goal here, though, is not to extol the greatness that is Alicia Keys, but to review her latest album, Girl on Fire.  There's been a lot of publicity surrounding this album, and she's done a lot of promotion in the months leading up to and since it's release on November 27th.  And yes, I'm ... late with this review (give me a break, I'm a full-time grad student!), but I assure you that I was very eager to very quickly purchase the album on its release date, and I can't think of a better way I could have spent those 8 bucks....\\" for the rest of this review, please go to [...]
030746363X|5.0|This book arrived and I was pleasantly surprised by the large amount of content.  It's a fascinating book that provides information on a bevy of topics.  I'm currently following Tim's slow carb diet and I love that you can still drink wine! This book would be appealing to a wide variety of readers, athletes, and dieters.  I'm glad that there are visuals and pictures for exercises and everyone's favorite: the before and after photos.
1401937519|5.0|What insight...I was sorry when I finished it.  Gives one a lot to think about.  I would recommend it anyone.
1572814136|5.0|This is the first deck of Tarot cards I have bought and they are fabulous for beginners.  They do have a slick coating but, I haven't found this to hinder any readings.  You just have to be a bit more careful when shuffling the deck.  Another great thing is that the cards will still bend slightly when handled by someone with strong hormones and the slick coating helps stabilize the deck so that they will return to being flat.  The art is beautiful and colorful.  Great price and well worth the buy.  My friends love getting readings and I know this deck will be around for a long time.
B008OOYALE|2.0|not happy with the game. it is always out of sync and it cant pick up the Internet half the time.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This was a GREAT movie! I see why it won director of the year. I highly recommend watching this movie
B00AIQP9DE|1.0|I downloaded n u cant finish the game -n looked into other free games all same misleading story so I'll stay away from G5
1936719010|5.0|While Resistance may not be a total bad guy, Steven Pressfield has given us a great gift with this book!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Very good show for anyone with a passing interest in science and the supernatural. Top-notch cast and incredibly good writing. I should actually give it 4 stars though because of the over-use of lens flare the director favors....all the time.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|It does a very good job of holding my kindle in place securely.  I can position it at different angles when I wish.  The only drawback is that I cannot &#34;twist&#34; the kindle in order to stand it vertically.
B00846WWVM|5.0|Lots of fun some are real brain teasers, great for young to old. Grandson just loves it can't get enough.
B008NEVP1S|5.0|Aimee is singing better than ever and I like the occasional feel reminiscent of previous work, including 'Til Tuesday.  Very catchy songs.  Glen Pickle  Sunday, March 17
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is a game of skill ;mind power; and just straight fun. I loved as soon as I played it. If you wa t to play game to pass time this is the one! Give it a try you wont be disapointed; I promise!
B009FZFONO|5.0|Great Series- I am catching up before the new season starts...Amazon is easy to order from and I like the way it keeps track of what episodes you have already purchased.
0316017930|5.0|Very thought provoking book that is a really fun and enjoyable to read while providing some unique insights into many subjects.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I got some extra features with this 11 disc set as this is the British version.  Truthfully I don't know why they changed some of the wording from the British edition.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Wasn't able to catch up on TV and loved every minute of it. Can't wait for the new season to start
1400069807|5.0|On some level, we all probably knew the dangers of processed foods, salt, sugar, fat, etc. But they are easy and delicious so it's easy to downplay the affect on our health. Moss has laid it all out on the table with thorough investigative reporting, deep analysis and a novelist's eye for drama. An excellent book--it'll be hard to look at a Hostess Cupcake the same way again.
B005LAIIA8|2.0|I was disappointed with this B&W film.  I was also disappointed with the level of the 3D, which is virtually non-existent.  The story was okay but not gripping at all.  I expected a lot more from Tim Burton, one of my favorite directors.
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|Much better than the first two and I'm hopefully for the last one. I feel like the story actually gets moving in this book. There is enough action to keep you entertained and it doesn't drag.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This was a chilling story that kept me hooked until the very end. I felt Catherine's anxiety as I was reading. The scariest thing about this story is that it's something that can happen to anyone. The perspective  is amazing in this book, you see Catherine during two different periods of her life, a few years apart, and feel the haunting affect that Lee had and still has on her throughout the story. Marvelous story!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this app is really fun app becouse it is a challenge to get the stuff you have to I really think you should get this game.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|works really quickly and easily<br />much easier than going on the Internet and searching it<br />very convienient<br />one of my favorite apps
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This is the free version, so I have ads.  They just pop at the most frustrating times.  As far as the game itself I rate this a 5 star.
B00AZL3PBK|1.0|I absolutely hates this game! Yes it may be free,  but it stinks it is just a cheap knock-off of Mario and Luigi.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|wish it would play videos then I might give it five stars. pretty good for free though, better than mobile versions which I hate.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Enjoyed the suspense and can't wait to start the next book. Love the series. All the characters are wonderful and all are favorites.
0790729733|1.0|used -very good rating means dvd works perfectly? not in this case; dvd hangs and crashes when played on three different parts of movie even though the dvd is nearly pristine in appearance; cleaning and buffing the dvd did not<br />fix the problem; guess this dvd slipped by the Round3's quality evaluation; the very low price of dvd lead me to conclude<br />that it was not cost effective to contact the seller for a replacement or refund.
B004OT6NJU|5.0|have been searching for this lego kit since christmas we will be building it and displaying it in our carribean theme room :)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book.  As usual, it was way better than the movie.  Very glad I read it, looking forward to more Nicholas Spraks.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|This game is a bit addictive, but I would enjoy it so much more if there were different levels of difficulty, different challenges, and such.
B00BKTFABE|5.0|my only problem is I can only take pictures of myself.  I would love to take some of my family. (you can lnly take  pictures from the front of my kindle)
B0059R5Q08|5.0|I'm an avid reader of classical literature and &#34;Jane Eyre&#34; is one of my most favorite books. The actors in this film do no disservice to my views of Jane and Mr. Rochester that I held in my head throughout the entire book; in fact, the actors' portrayals here enhance the book. I just wish this beautiful film were longer.
B0095P33IW|4.0|Would I want to see it again soon, I think not.  But, it was a real slam banger with a somewhat believable plot.  The hero wins and the villains loose.  What's not to like?
0525948023|5.0|What can I say, this guy is an Ascended Master upon Earth, wonderful book, with wonderful expression of spiritual help especially for combating the ego!
B0049J3QAY|5.0|My 3.5 year old sat through the whole thing AND noticed the Woody and Nemo cameo. The real joy was him not being scared by the first few scenes
B000W089XS|5.0|What a way to showcase three great silver screen actresses in an all time Hollywood classic laugh a minute movie!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love how it gives you many options and you are able to choose many different sounds at the same time. It's perfect! We like to use it to rock our baby boy to sleep. He really likes it as well. We especially like the Zen sound mixed with the flute.
0060090367|3.0|I like the Marian Keyes writes but I found this book to be a little slow getting through. I got a little irritated with it dragging on & on. It does have a good plot & it will &#34;hit home&#34; if you have been through a broken marriage.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|With all the good reviews I decided to download it and after I beat a few levels the game started getting intense but really fun. I loved the Romeo one the best that was the easiest to beat. I've downloaded many 100+ games before but none as fun as this one. I hope there will be more games with harder levels keep it up!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's plain awesome! Way better then temple run. You MUST download it! I highly recommend it. Here's a hint for the game: dodge the trains in mid-air.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|2 down 1 left to go.. I read the 50 shades and loved them.. But  these r pretty close to begin  better.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Easy to download and works perfectly.  Needed this for the new tablet to read service manuals in the field.  Will be getting more apps from Amazon.
B000YMM3CC|4.0|what a great chick flick!! so adorable and amazing I would watch it ten more times! so so so good!
B0063M22QO|4.0|I love solving puzzles and this one was an &#34;old&#34; favorite of mine!!  Relaxing...takes my mind off all the chores I have to do!!!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This book finds Christian Grey and Ana getting married, going on their honeymoon and working on having a good married relationship. The freedom referred to in the title comes from Christian working through his self hatred issues and learning to accept love from Ana and from his family. Ana continues to challenge him by not doing everything as he wishes and he tries to protect her by keeping her in the dark about threats that may endanger her. Both of them learn that they have to trust and communicate or their marriage won't work. I found this trilogy to be an interesting study in the psychology of people who are wounded at a young age. It certainly validates Maslow's hierarchy. There does continue to be graphic sexual scenes, but they are more consensual than in the first book and more joyful. This still makes this a book for the over 18 crowd.<br />Heat factor hot.
B00B3MN65K|5.0|If you like Josh Groban you will love this album. His voice is so amazing, the music is wonderful, and the lyrics are beautiful. I absolutely love this album and have listened to it over and over since downloading it.
B0083Z614S|5.0|The most beautiful book ever!  If I could choose to read any book again, for the first time: it would be the story of Mary, Dickon, Colin and the Secret Garden.
B009DJB8I2|5.0|Almost a must-have for any Portal fans. It has all the music from Portal 2 (great background music for pretty much any game, as well as generic Internet browsing), and quite a few of the best songs from the original Portal. I was pleasantly surprised to find 4000 Degrees Kelvin on here.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|FUNNNN!!!!!! IT HAS SO MANY DIFFERENT GAMES IN ONE APPLICATION... so convient and nice just a game ... its totally worth it.... greatest game everrr
B0071XO8RA|5.0|My first Hugh Howey book, and it certainly won't be my last! Characters were wonderfully developed and each very unique. The plot kept me reading chapter after chapter, eager to uncover more. And lastly... I don't know how to describe his writing style, but what I love the most, is that each sentence feels like its been well thought out. I never felt that a word, or phrase, or even the structure of the writing was repetive at all.  Not only is that hard to come by nowadays (since everyone thinks they're a writer worth publishing), but it's also extremely refreshing and appreciated. It's a pure joy just to read his sentences, even if they didn't tell such an involving story.  :)
B000MQ54OY|5.0|Blu-ray is SO much better than just a regular CD.  This was shipped quickly and was well packaged.  Highly recommended.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Now I can see all the classic Rocky movies in a high definition resolution, great package and a superve collection
B000G03S94|4.0|Love muse, love this album. It's got some classics that sound great on vinyl! Mine came warped but i was able to un-warp it by setting it on our hardwood floor and stocking several heavy books on it. My floors are heated so the warm floor helped loosen it up. I've heard of people doing the same but placing it in the window where it can get warmed by the sun.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|An unusual story told in a captivating way.  Every few pages I set the book down not only to contemplate and digest the many vivid images that yann martel has a true gift of describing, but also to postpone the book's ending as long as possible.
B000E6GCJS|5.0|I love this album, the music flows well and it caters to my style of music. The vinyl came in excellent condition!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I downloaded this app because i thought it looked cool. I love the smoothness of the crystal graphics! Don't know what else to say about it. I guess its cool. I don't have much of a significant reason for it...  love it or hate it I suppose.  =-/
B004UPANGM|4.0|For me, best 80's horror movie.  Haven't seen it in years and looking forward to revisiting the original.  Wastes no time getting into it with a de-cap in the 1st 5 minutes.
B008I3RARW|1.0|Consider three game modes, awful music, a small number of cars, and most importantly, ONE TRACK!! I do NOT recommend this game to anybody!
B005EWDA3I|5.0|Was worried about how it would end but it was perfect...just sad to say goodbye to Aomame & Tengo :)
1939416019|5.0|Bought this book on Google Play Store and I'm instantly hooked to this book! Finished reading it and bought the 2nd + 3rd edition right away! Definitely worth the money.<br />I've never liked reading books before but this one really got into me. Some grammatical errors here and there, but I still enjoyed it a lot.
B00BDNCXTE|5.0|I used to have this on tape from WNEW and lost it over the years. It was always my favorite and I'm so glad it came out on CD. If you like the Jerry Garcia Band, this is a must have.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I chose a five star rate because i am the type to enjoy the romance filled stories filled with heartbreak ,love triangles ,backstabbing,secrets,sorrow,depression,and incredible action i also loved the series gregor the overlander so go suzin collins i hope she will write many more novels.tosum EVERYTHING up i reccomend this book to everyone who knows how to read .p.s this nothing like twilight so if you heard that the person who said it as never read the book.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|I'm not sure if we'd purchase this movie to keep, but I was surprised at how much my husband and I liked it, and of course the kids thought it was hilarious. We're not a big gamer-family, but really enjoyed the story of a video game &#34;bad guy&#34; wanting to change his life's course. It was a fun family movie night!
B008I3RARW|4.0|that’s  right this game takes full advantage of your ability to tilt in all directions.<br />I do have to admit it does take some time to get use to.<br />with great sound and great graphics Race Rally 3D  is a game worth looking in to .<br />one plus is that this  game does not fall in to the “ I completed it in one day category'’<br />cons<br />price is a bit to high – I think it would be a steal at 2 and fair at 3
B0074QGGK6|2.0|The theme of the book is good. However, the author couldn't write as a book without repeating the title concept several times. It is a one page synopsis than a book
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book allows the reader to get a small glimpse inside the life of a real American Patriot. I especially appreciated the input from Taya about the affects of war on the family.
B000SEIDR0|5.0|Mr. Pollan has written a book full of facts in a friendly folksy way. He describes some wonderful food experiences and some horrid experiences.<br />Should be a required book for high school. Very informative.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|great product with great timely arrival. kept in good condition through transport and due to a rainy day was placed in a plastic bag to protect the product!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Uninstall version 4 from your phone! You may half to clear the data first then delete it.<br />Install Amazon Appstore and then install<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/The-Weather-Channel-for-Android/dp/B0064X7FVE<br /><br />this is version 3.9!<br /><br />I started it and it crashed and I went to my app settings and cleared the data and then restarted it and it works great!<br /><br />Thanks Amazon!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Excellent.  Truly absorbing story.  Can recommend reading.  Never have I read such a book and really hoped for a happy ending.
B000O77SRC|5.0|The is one of my favorite movies!  It is hilarious, well-written, and exciting.  Alan Rickman is such a awesome villain.
B000N4SHPS|3.0|I loved the Rocky movies growing up. I purchased the sixth one to complete my set. I didn't like this one as much as the others. However, I wanted to own all of them.
160774273X|5.0|Absolutely fantastic book!<br />If you like great bread and pizza and have the desire to bake at home BUY THE BOOK!
B009OXS8RQ|5.0|I am very happy I bought Paradise by Lana Del Rey on vinyl. Already had the digital copy.  Don't regret it.

B00A8MGLAI|5.0|I imagine there will be many 5-star and 1-star reviews of this movie.  It is wildly ambitious, unconventional and occasionally flawed, and it will evoke strong positive and negative reactions from the film going public.<br /><br />Because it explores what some may consider to be weighty or arcane existential themes, and does so in a non-linear fashion, many viewers will find Cloud Atlas confounding, boring even tedious... unless they soldier through the first hour and begin to feel the stories coalesce into a master symphony.<br /><br />I had some issues with the make-up and stilted dialogue, but after seeing the movie a couple times now, I chose to overlook the flaws because the movie is so mesmerizing from both a cinematographic and emotional perspective.<br /><br />Cloud Atlas reminded me of Stanley Kubrick's movies, so if you happen to like Kubrick, I think you will also enjoy Cloud Atlas.  If not, then you might want to stay away.  Regardless, if you approach this movie with an open mind and heart, I think it's thematic and storytelling power will wash over you.<br /><br />I loved it.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|I'm very happy about the movie Sinister is a creepy and disturbing movie, is a good movie, I really appreciate it!
B008RA3X5E|3.0|The alarm is basic alarm clock function.  The additional faces are only about 3 extra.  I prefer to wake to music so I felt the upgrade was worth it.  The functions are very simple and that's all I wanted.  Reliable if I keep my kindle charged and the volume up.  Wish it had a volume override if I forget to turn my volume up before bedtime.  Multiple alarms is nice

0670023329|5.0|My grandfather fought in the Korean conflict as a US Marine. He was part of the &#34;Chosen Few.&#34; I heard a few stories from him about the actual experience and saw short video clips of marines charging up and down steep mountains, but never did I even begin to understand the totalitarianizm of the North Korean government or the implications that this kind of culture has on the people it breeds. This is an excellent and informitive book. Assuming that the book is acurate, I learned a lot by reading it. Thanks Blaine!

0156030306|5.0|Review: this is a seminal work of the 20th century and should be required reading in every high school. Scroll up to some of the wonderful five-star reviews for a synopsis.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:<br />I wanted to touch on the philosophical issues the book raises. Is what happened a tragedy? Keyes opens with the Allegory of the Cave. Do we pity the man who, having seen the light, is cast back into the shadows? Or do we rejoice at the opportunity he had, however brief it was? For a brief time, Charlie could see beyond the shadows. Imagine if we could rise up for a moment and realize what life, the universe, and everything mean. Nirvana, if you will. Who would turn that down, even if you couldn't remember the revelation afterword?
0375831002|5.0|It's well written and deals with the difficult subject of the Holocaust through the eyes of Death.  Enjoyable for readers of any age although younger readers should be cautioned.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|It sure doesn't help when you set the bar pretty as high as the incomparable Ian McEwan does.  When you consistently turn out stellar novels, little margin of error is left to fall short of greatness.  McEwan is certainly one of my favorite writers and, even at his worst, writes some of the most beautiful English prose.  While \\"Sweet Tooth\\" is definitely not one of his masterpieces, I'm a bit surprised by some of the awful reviews people have written.<br /><br />This Cold War era spy/love novel centers around Serena Frome, Cambridge mathematics graduate, who is recruited into MI5 and works on secretly funding writers whose politics lean in the same direction as the government.  The obvious love entanglement that ensues from her \\"mission\\" is the central plot line.  While several of the characters lack the depth I would have preferred, I also thought of this as an artistic touch.  The shadowy world of Cold War politics and espionage provide a world of intrigue and uncertainty where nothing is what it seems to be.  In many ways, McEwan reflects this in his opaque treatment of many of the characters in the book, particularly spurned love interest Max.<br /><br />Is this McEwan's finest effort?  Certainly not.  However, even if one found this novel wanting, McEwan writes better than 99% of other novelists out there and while it doesn't rise to the heights of \\"Atonement\\", \\"Chesil Beach\\" or \\"Amsterdam\\", it still is a very satisfying and enjoyable book.
B000FA675C|2.0|I am an avid reader of many genres and time periods, from simply entertaining pulp fiction to serious literary works to informative and interesting non-fiction. After reading The Da Vinci Code, I was greatly disappointed on almost all levels. Yes, it was a 'page-turner' that persistently begged you to read 'just one more chapter.' However, rather than this being the result of high quality writing, mesmerizing characters, or compelling plot, the effect in The Da Vinci Code was achieved via a literary version of the cheap parlor trick: make sure that all of your chapters are uber-short and end abruptly, incomplete, and blatantly on the verge of adding some new key piece of information in just another paragraph or page. Also, while the plot is quite intricate in at least some respects, the writing is incredibly simplistic.<br /><br />On another note, although it is a novel(and it is categorized as a fictional novel)claims are explicitly made in the foreword that it is based on researched and verified facts. Rather, it is in fact quite the opposite. The claims about the driving plot points of historical events, documents, etc. are astoundingly off-base. This wouldn't be such a problem if it was clearly presented as a non-fiction \\"what-if\\" or \\"alternative history\\" tale, but that is not the case. Everything in the foreword and even within the novel itself clearly at times states and other places strongly implies historical accuracy concerning the 'true' biography of Jesus, nature and workings of the Catholic Church (and, no, I am not Catholic, have never been and do have my own disagreements and issues with the organization and some of it's history).<br /><br />Positively, the plot is imaginative, the descriptions of the locales are striking, and the various codes and clues are inventive and interesting.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|it stinks because I cant even play it!!!! every time I go on the app it loads and then just sends me back to my home page.
B00932AA5G|4.0|While it is a foreign movie with subtitles, it has a twisted story that is easy to follow. Very captivating
6305609705|5.0|Apocalypse Now is Francis Ford Copella's visually stunning retelling of Joseph Conrad's anti-Imperialist novella Heart of Darkness.  Set against the backdrop of America's darkest, most nebulous foreign conflict, the Vietnam War, Apocalypse Now tells the story of Captain Willard, a burned out Airborne officer is sent in country to dispatch an innovative military genius, the mysterious Col. Kurtz, who has gone native. The deeper Willard and his Navy patrol boat crew travel into the dark recesses of the Vietnam, the more the landscape and the risk of madness threaten to engulf them.  As Willard witnesses the madness of war and learns about Kurtz from his dossier, he begins to question both his mission and those who sent him. The startling climax will leave both the protagonist and the viewer forever changed.  I would also recommend &#34;Hearts of Darkness,&#34; the documentary about the filming of Apocalypse Now and the effect it had on both cast and crew.
B00A14SQBU|5.0|She clearly has the best voice around - doesn't need all the voice-box/electronic tricks to sound good.  The songs are mainstream pop, fresh/creative, and very catchy.  You really can't go wrong with a Christina album!

B000000Y26|5.0|I recently overhauled my 30 year old Yamaha YP-701 turntable ( new belt; new Audio Technica AT95E cartridge, and recalibration) and was glad to see that vinyl recordings are available. I primarily like Blues, Jazz, Classical and Rock , but also enjoy many other forms of music. I'm not, I suppose, a true audiophile, but I do enjoy vinyl recording of music over cd's for  my primary music interests. They seem to sound better to me. I have an NAD 7175 PE receiver; Yamaha YP-701 turntable; Teac A2340SX reel to reel tape deck and JBL88 speakers. An old system, yet I enjoy it over some newer technology, This is a fine recording and I enjoy Wes Montgomery's easy style of Jazz.
B0070Y46UY|1.0|I liked the first part of the book about Pi's early childhood, the zoo, his spiritual yearnings. But eventually the story turns grim, dark, bloody and gruesome. I've read about castaways before but never read anything so gruesome. After seeing a few movie previews with a boy and a tiger on a boat, I thought I might like this story, but I am sorry I read it. If you don't like blood details and guts this book is not for you! Its sickening.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  In the beginning I didn't quite understand why it kept going back to the child, but I certainly didn't expect the ending!
B009LDMJGA|5.0|Purchased as a gift for a Soundgarden lover who was thrilled. Top quality and price. In this digital age, it's awesome to have vinyl available.
B009I2UH2W|4.0|Good and reliable. It does what it promises. The fact that it lights up, hepls you when you are driving and charging at night. No surprises, I recommend this product.
0061336459|5.0|My SCORE counselor recommended this book to me plus some others and it was really helpful in changing my attitude toward money. The free seminar that comes with the book didn't hurt either. It's coming up in June and I can't wait.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I love this book and the way it weaved the past and present together by alternating chapters.  The book was enlightening in the way flowers make us feel and in expressing our feelings to others who are special in our lives.<br />One of my top 10 books!

B00BHMETKC|4.0|John Goodman was great. Alan Arkin was great. Ben Afflect was very good.<br />The other characters weren't fleshed out much at all.<br />The ending was a bit over the top, although maybe it actually happened that way. I don't know, but it wasn't very believable, the plane lifting off the ground while the Iranians were chasing it down the runway.

B00338QENI|4.0|I really liked how this book moved back and forth between fact and raw human emotion surrounding the use of HeLa cells. I would recommend this book to anyone that has a curiosity in how our medical advancements have evolved as a result and the ethical concerns that accompany it.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this everyday from almost every device for capturing notes from meetings on different projects, pictures of recipes or ideas I want to come back to later. Great layout and interface !
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had to see what happened, in book 2, after book 1, of course.  Steamy parts, some I didn't love, but overall the story is entertaining, educational in some ways, and I liked how the main character was written (her thoughts, her development, etc.).  Woo, makes you wish for your own Christian Grey...or perhaps CG minus a little of his character - but wait to read book 2 and 3 to see how they develop.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|The game is super cute and super fun. You raise your monsters from babies and watch them grow up. At first it is hard to get money but then you enter competitions and you can quickly and easily become really rich. The game is super fun and I highly recommend it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I liked the storyline as well as the steamy parts.  I didn't love some of the &#34;scenes,&#34; but they were key to the story and development of the characters.  Overall, I really enjoyed this trilogy - I re read the whole trilogy again!!

B006VFLIYK|3.0|For those who enjoy fast-action, espionage, and a &#34;James Bond&#34; stereotype hero, this book will keep you entertained to the end. Will Robie has all the skills and macho one would expect to find in this complex plot. The twists and turns throughout appear improbable and unexpected. Nevertheless, the lurid details Baldacci created were not completely surprising nor unexpected. Although the details may be different from book to book, the outcome and resolution takes several chapters to unwind and explain. It isn't until the last paragraph that the title rather weakly makes sense.  The story kept me reading to the end, but it was so similar to the other kinds of stories Baldacci has written that I was neither enthralled nor overly satisfied with its outcome.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun mini games. some are slow, but for it being a free ap its pretty awesome. Definitely a good time killer.

B00B23O96A|4.0|I like to scan the upcoming release schedule and was excited to see that a new Clapton CD was on the way.  Tuesday being release day, I checked Amazon throughout the week to see what the fans were saying prior to my weekend shopping.  I'm glad that the reviews I read did not deter me from the purchase. OK, this is not Cream Eric and it is not Journeyman.  This is not wailing electric guitar solos. If that is what you want, it is all out there for your listening pleasure. This is an artist putting out a document of where he is today. It is laided back Sunday morning listening. You might describe this, and the last few studio releases, as adult contemporary. Though criticized for not being what some fans expect Clapton to be doing, I've enjoyed them all.  They are albums of finely crafted songs and are performed with the highest level of musical talent.  To say that Clapton phoned this in is an outrage.  This is an artist going where the muse is taking him at this point in his life and I hope that it keeps coming.
B0060MYM3S|1.0|Shipped on March 7th still haven't got it was suppose to have it by the 12th it's now the 18th. Frustrating I could of just gone out and bought it already.
B00BMVTS1S|3.0|Has Peter Jackson spent the last few years studying Steven Spielberg? The goblin chase in the mountains was four times too long and reminded me of many other blockbuster movies. Ho hum, at least a production such as this creates a lot of jobs for artists.

B00B5HQKNI|1.0|this movie is so un-bond ! I don't know why it made so much money at the boxoffice? Daniel Craig is a great actor, but he is no James Bond. worst Bond ever.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Even though it's a book about kids with cancer it does have really tender happy moments.  The characters are wonderful.  Very well written.  Once I got into it, I couldn't put it down.  Definitely worth a read!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My kids watched it twice!  They loved it! Parents enjoyed it too, lots of laughs.  Would recommend it for anyone!
B002Y0TGOU|3.0|while it was entertaining, there were too many special effects, not enough character development - actors seemed to be too pre-occupied trying to be their predecessors so was glad I was at home instead of paying premium prices in the movie theater.
B00A8307BG|5.0|there are no downsides to this outstanding piece of work. Everyone digs this production. Its a given that trower will touch the strings just right to convey the emotion in his soul. What a gift. As a bass player i immediately targeted the bassline. Cool. If it causes me to close my eyes drift and sync with the drums im trippin. Little red rooster and see my life top my list. Turn the lights out, headphones on, max bass, and fire it up! Chill out. Lifes good
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|I'm a guy who has enjoyed David Bowie over the years without being a huge fan, for no particular reason other than I was listening to other artists.  Because there's not much else going on these days, I ran right out and got \\"The Next Day\\" just after it was released, however, and I've listened to it a couple of times.  It's very, very good.  I'm not giving it five--it's not going to change my world--but this is solid, interesting music, very well sung and performed.  It sounds very edgy, very modern and very Bowie.  I won't listen to this a thousand times, but I'll listen to it a couple dozen at least, and I'll enjoy it every time.<br /><br />It's nice to know that this guy still has it, and he still has it, big time.

B000FC2KL0|5.0|Not being too big a fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers I was hesitant to give this a read. The first description of shooting up drew me in and I was hooked. it's fascinating to read about the evolution of the band and the conception of their songs. highly recommend this book to anyone that likes a good biography.
0385349947|5.0|I found this book to be a thought provoking inspiration. I like that is short; I was able to easily read it on a recent business trip. It drew me in and the books writing style is very engaging. Sheryl is very honest about her privileges, her strengths and her faults. Yes, she has advantages and connections that most of us don't have, and that might have gotten her in the door, but it didn't keep her there. She has found success the old fashion way, by working hard. The stories in the book are fascinating and I liked having a first hand glimpse into Silicon Valley and the people that make it work. Someone else suggested this be a read to high school students. I agree wholeheartedly. This book shows the power of making the most of your connections, the people you meet along the way, and reaching for what inspires you.

B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Hello<br /><br />I would like to comment on a few points about Disney's latest release...<br /><br />First of all, this a beatiful movie that all my family enjoyed, as it is expected from any Disney movie, it made us laugh, gave us a healthy dose of thrills and adventure and at some point, brought a little tear to our eyes...<br /><br />When I was in a drawing class at college, the biggest prase that I recived from a teacher that didn't liked me very much (I allways suspected that I reminded her of some exboyfriend or something like that) Was that she couldn't believed that a particular assigment that I presented was made by me...<br /><br />I guess the same can be said about \\"Wreck-it Ralph\\", the movie is so good, that still there are a lot of people that think that this movie was made by Pixar.<br /><br />The past efforts by Disney of venturing in the CGI field away from Pixar had ranged from fairly entretaining (Chicken little,Meet the Robinsons) to just plain awfull (Dinosaur,The wild), but this is the first time that they have achive true greatness, by giving us a movie that can proudly stand shoulder to shoulder with the best of Pixar studios gems. This I suspect would have a lot to do with having as a producer non other than John Lasseter, who in a great display of sportmanship, steps out of his role of Pixar's main chief and director, and helps Disney hit this homerun finally by their own.<br /><br />From here I would like to adress the plot of the movie, so if you haven't seen it,be aware that the next paragraph will contain SPOILERS...<br /><br />I am still confused about the exact point of the message that the movie tries to get thru...at the beginning, it is pretty obvious that the main character feels that he can be more than what he has been all his life...he wants to be and live better, and that there is a straight and praceble motivation, but then by the middle of the movie the direction turns and it seems that the message changes and now it feels like the best that he can do is stay the same because it is his place in life and he should be happy with it. I think at the end the message that mostly came thru for me was that, like Dean Martin said, \\"You're nobody till somebody loves you\\".<br /><br />Some people on amazon's reviews have complain about the humor and themes (the \\"putting nana to pasture\\" joke, the bulling by the racers, for example) but you have to remember that art allways reflects the society that produce it in the first place, so if you feel unconfortable with this things, may be you should take a good look at what we as members of our society are doing in real life.<br /><br />One final tought, and this is in regards of the packaging of the 4 discs version of the movie...<br /><br />I can't believe that after the tons of millions of dollars that Disney makes with this and all of its other products, they have put the 4 discs in a 2 disc case, thus increasing the possibility of damage to the discs to almost certain, how many cents do you save by doing this ?, where are the sturdy 4 slots packages that you used before ?<br /><br />Thank you for reading... :-)ke the best that he can do is stay the same because it is his place in life and he should be happy with it.

B00BHU9BV6|1.0|Did not like how it was presented and left way too much of the actual character building out so it was VERY hard to follow the plot.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I found the book difficult to put down. It was riveting, educational and perhaps best of all presented genius of Lincoln in very human terms. I couldn't imagine a &#34;modern&#34; president assembling his cabinet from his/her rivals. From an historical standpoint it shows how Lincoln's thoughts and ideas regarding slavery evolved over time making  him one of America's greatest presidents.
B0039TAHMA|5.0|First time we used Amazon for movies.<br />Worked great with no issues.<br />Will use again.<br />I would recommend this to all.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Simple, easy to use...love the fact that it also has a history so I can glance back at past configurations.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Entertaining, decent mix of puzzles and hidden objects. I finished it quickly without using many hints, but worth the $1.99 that I paid for it.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Love it! Colin Firth is the Mr Darcy. The series does a great job of capturing<br /> the biting wit of Jane Austen's characterizations better than the other vesions.
B00AJLHU3K|4.0|Very good - quite a bit of variety to the choice/style of songs and a couple that will become favourites. Like all good albums it takes a few playings to really apprciate and get into. It's Richard Thompson doing what he does best.
B000244FDW|3.0|This version is stark and bare compared to the others. The lack of budget shows. Its pace is a little slow as it adhers to the book almost too much. However this  version has the best and funniest Mr Collins!  Jane, Charlotte, and the Gardeners are also better represented in this version.
B00A14SQBU|3.0|Christina's voice is beautiful, if not overwhelming the music, but that's okay since the music is nothing extraordinary. The lyrics are not really inspiring for me, nothing we haven't all heard before. The sit on my finger and spin song seems a bit Jersey Shore-ish. Ugh. She's a grown woman, who I would love to see evolve with her talent.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|This version has more romance and passion then other versions and cinematography is stunning. But this version lacks Austen's bite which is the best fun. Also Mr Bennett is NOT a pig farmer and many other inaccuracies drove me crazy!
B007MAETA8|5.0|This has become my favorite album of John's, the lyrics really hit me- though most of his do, and with a classic rock feel, it's different than his other stuff. The more I listen, the more I love it.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I love this book...it was sweet and sad and had a very good ending..like all Nicholas Sparks books do. I recommend this book to everyone who loves Nicholas Sparks.
B009738XXM|4.0|This is a fun album, although I've heard 'call me maybe' a million times on the radio, I still don't mind it when listening to the album. I am surprised more of the songs haven't gotten any radio play. It is an upbeat album that is great to take on a run.
B0015DYIH2|1.0|No wonder they changed it in the movie, it was horrible. This would probably be the worst ending to a book I have ever read. Such a snoozer, I read that whole book just to get to the ending and It disappointed me so much. It didn't make me cry, happy, or even sad that the series was over. I recommend reading every book in the series except this one, don't waste your time just go watch the movie.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Held my attention and was vivid and inspirational. I also liked the twists that it had with the characters. Good read
B00AO2P3GA|1.0|I just bought this game for 6:99 a couple weeks ago now you lower the price to 99 I cant believe how these apps rip people off<br />in the end
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I started reading the series after watching the Hunger Games movie and when I found out my students were reading it in their humanities class. Took me a bit to get through the first book (I think because I'd already seen the movie of it), but once I moved onto the second book I was hooked. The story picks up right where the last ends and the characters are consistent. A few unexpected twists. Overall an entertaining read. I'm curious to see the movies of books two and three.
B003MWHVLY|5.0|Another must have for music collectors. Unique, fresh, and so relaxing to just kick back and relax to. She speaks a message of love, life, and relationships. I think every one will relate to this CD.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I love this song and the CD came and I am playing it over and over again.  The CD was in great shape.
B007CKNX28|5.0|I saw him perform on Jool's Hollinds show (VH1).  He performed with both of his bands, blew me away!!! He is an amazing musician, writer and  emits never ending charisma. If he ever comes to Buffalo I will be front and center. What scares me, is I see myself throwing myself on the stage and screaming like a school girl. (I'm 57, how sick is that?) Read about him on wickopedia, interesting life.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Riordan has done it again.  He has carefully woven ancient mythology and the modern world with wonderful characters and non-stop adventure.  Anxiously awaiting the next book!
B008S8PPPG|5.0|I caught her performance on Jools Hollands show, fantastic!. I encourage every one to purchase it, you will not be disappointed.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I liked this game. Not to confusing, or to hard or to easy. Good story line, and the game didn't lag or stall on my kindle fire. Only thing I would have liked is if it was a bit LONGER before you have to buy!
B008HK3XOU|3.0|If you're just looking to cover your kindle than this is just fine. But if its a stand you need this is not for you.
1616550414|5.0|Its an amazing book highly recommend for all the true fans. The only let down is the binding is not super secure, I just get scared its gonna fall apart on me someday. Other than that its a great buy. :-)
0817439390|5.0|This is an excellent book on the basics of digital photography. It is well written, easy to read, and pleasantly illustrated. Well done Bryan.
B0063IH60K|5.0|The game is easy to play, but I do wish that it had a feature where you could play 3 cards on the draw.
B0011UJMK2|4.0|Exciting. Well written. Lots of good insight into the Russian culture and police state.<br />I did not want it to end.<br />But I had to find out how it comes out.<br />Recommend.
B009VB9VKY|5.0|I rented this movie because my adult daughters kept talking about it.  It was ok. Needless to say there wasn't much of a story line. But if you like to look at nearly naked men, you will like the movie.  As always, MMC plays a good part.
B002OMZTSU|5.0|Never self pitying or maudlin, Craig Ferguson demonstrates a rare honesty and remarkable good humor in recounting his twisted path from the Scottish lowlands to successful, American talk show host.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game was really fun. It has wonderful graphics, an interesting storyline, fairly easy puzzles but a great variety and good hidden object games. There are just enough to make it interesting but not so many as to make it cumbersome.<br /><br />The game play is fairly quick but worth every penny in its three dollar charge to unlock the full game.<br /><br />There is bonus content which allows you an extra chapter of story so that just when you think you are done, you can keep going for another 20 minutes.<br /><br />You can also go back to all the hidden object and 'domino' games and play them over, with slight variations each time.<br /><br />A great game. I'm looking forward to getting more G5 games.<br /><br />Just a little warning, some of the graphics may be a little scary for younger children (like 7 or 8).
B0013POLS8|1.0|I ordered what was clearly described as a three disc set. It was only two. Then begins the drama calling returning getting the wrong one again calling again waiting to hear back. What happened to just ordering something and getting it?
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I could not stop watching this! So many interesting twists and turns. I now understand why everyone raves about this series!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this heartbreaking story of love, hurt and redemption. Highly recommended you will not be disappointed. Based in the San Francisco Bay Area.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|This was a great movie which, with it's time-travel element, raised some thought-provoking questions.  We like Bruce Willis as an actor and action films in general, so this was a good combination for us.
B009EANE3M|4.0|I own all three of THE SCRIPT's albums and consider this one their 2nd best after their self-titled debut album in 2009.  If you loved their first album you should love this one too.  If you liked their 2nd album (Science & Faith) then you should like #3 even better.<br /><br />Stand out tracks for me on this album, with the rest all enjoyable -- I have not flagged any tracks as sub-par on my iPod for this CD.<br />* No Words<br />* Broken Arrow<br />* Give The Love Around<br />* Six Degrees of Separation
B0094D462M|5.0|YES OF COURSE!<br /><br />If you are a person who enjoys breathing air, then this movie has EVERYTHING YOU HAVE EVEN NEEDED IN YOUR LIFE.<br /><br />Sorry for the caps, this movie takes me right to the.....danger zone....
B007REV4YI|4.0|Daniel Craig is the best Bond ever. The movie was exciting and it was one of my first to watch on Blu-ray, which made it more enjoyable.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am really hooked on this series! So much in each program and so many interesting characters. Love it! I would definitely recommend this program.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|Girl  I loved this book so much and it was really good. Written very well and I just like it
B008K8VDPU|5.0|My grandson got this app for his Kindle Fire, and he plays it all the time.  He is musically inclined and does very well with it.
B00168OIOE|5.0|Great movie, but terrible purchase.  What was supposed to be a 4-disc set was a 2-disc set!  No Blu-Ray was included adn the DVD that was included was a &#34;Damaged file&#34; that my player could not recognize.  I ended up buying a new set from the Disney Store.
B00BVYQ832|3.0|TWD started as an excellent pass-time, a creative--if creepy--way to unwind at the end of the day.  The increased focus, though, on Woodbury and the Governor's sadistic regime are making me wonder how much more attention I'll give to the series.  The point of zombie fiction is that it's just that, fiction:  unreal, most likely impossible, but scary and thrilling.  The Governor is too much like too many politicians ravaging our world to be  fun, and the continued elements of overt torture feel like today's news reports.  I say move on from the Governor storyline and back into a different sort of survival mode.
B002QH2NUA|3.0|I was there in that concert and it was great! The DVD itself is defective and I can not return it because the return window expired!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a fun game for people who like horses. The horses are fairly realistic and customizable. You can buy tack and other items for your horses with coins and gems you earn or buy. The one really negative aspect of this game is that a lot of items cost a lot of gems, and it is very hard to earn gems through playing the game. Your only real choices are to buy them with real money, complete some third party offers, or wait until you level up.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I wouldn't know what do without this app. It is awesome. I wish they had left in the NIV1984 version. But I still have my hardcopy.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|My grandkids got this on their Kindles - they loved the movie and wanted to read the books.  Now they want to read the entire series.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a Bible Tool that I have with me all the time.  It is easy to use and I love that I can listen to the Bible being read.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is one of my little boys' favorite games (2 and 4 years old), but is also challenging enough for the rest of the family, too.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|it's not what I thought it would be a little boring and not believable. I would not recommend it save your money
B007W4OZ76|5.0|I just wanted to get dropbox files on my Kindle Fire.  It works just fine.  It takes a bit of random clickery to figure it out but once I got the hang of clicking on the root and changing it from device to cloud all fell into place nicely.  I have not tried to setup auto sync.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I'm not fond of stories written in the first person. I like to get an incite into all the characters. To be fair, I haven't read too much of the book.
B007KYQIEQ|5.0|This is one of our favorite movies, with two of our favorite actors.  I bought it for my Kindle so whenever I am bored, waiting in a Drs office or whatever, I have something to take my mind off things.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I LUV this game! Its SO fun!! You'll find it super addicting. Trust me, you regret it at all!!!! I have 1 and 2!!
B005HSL626|5.0|Action game that is great fun, and doesn't encourage violence (just very efficient food preparation).  If you haven't seen it yet, look up the live-action Fruit Ninja video on YouTube... CLASSIC !!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I had just finished a large, dense read, and craved something light, yet not trivial, and this book was the perfect thing for that. There was enough trauma in the main protagonist's life that I felt I could become emotionally vested in the course of events for her. In all this was a delightful, relatively light read for me, but once again being light does not mean lacking anything.<br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT***<br />**The one The one minus for me in this novel is not just how well, but how easily everything seemed to work out for the girl. People seemed drawn to her, everyone just seemed to like her immediately, and while this is fine, it does have something of a &#34;perfect story&#34; or fairy tale effect. There was no pathos of the rejected person, or the misfit, struggling with those issues along with others; but once again, in spite of the &#34;perfect ending&#34; way everything worked out, I felt engaged with the characters and enjoyed the book.**<br /><br />I would recommend this for younger readers or for anyone looking for an easy but still engaging read.
B005LAIH9K|5.0|As you may expect, this reunion is funny as previous versions. Cast is a little older and alot more responsible. But, they still bring the crowd to a roar.
B009GX6SSK|5.0|I like the interpersonal relationships, and Chris O'Donnell is one of my favorite actors.  Of course, Linda Hunt is great.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said already, this show totally rocks, I highly recommend it. Regarding the issues that a lot of people are having, I did not have any problems watching all the Blu ray discs, I just used the first disc to choose the episode I wanted to watch, and the switched the disco when the player ask me to, this also solved the problem in the first season set.<br /><br />WINTER HAS ARRIVED!!!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a very good game. The only thing I would change is that in order to purchase mane and such for your horses you could use coins instead of gems. But all in all I love this game!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Whole family loves this game (although my daughters wish there were the option of female avatars).  Lots of fun vehicles and gadgets.
0525953590|5.0|Sean Carroll does an excellent job of weaving the history of the search for and discovery of the Higgs with the science behind the Fields and Particles associated with it. For years I have been reading popular science literature hoping for a glimmer of understanding of why the searh for the Higgs was important. Dr. Carrol has delivered this glimmer of understanding to me with this book. I would recommend this book to anyone who like me lacks the mathematical expertise of a physicist but still wants to understand the foudations of our universe.
B00BVYQ832|5.0|I must say that I am no fan of any tv series, but this show is great. It's like an ongoing movie.
0385535147|4.0|I just finished the audiobook.  I haven't read a Grisham novel for a long time, and decided to give this one a try.  It's an interesting, if implausible, story which would make a good 'caper' film.  It took a while for it to 'unwind' but it kept me interested, wanting to find out just what was taking place.  I don't want it to be a 'spoiler', so I won't give away the ending.  I'm still trying to decide, but I think I liked the ending.  It was different than the usual 'crime' or 'courtroom' story.
B0073CCYAM|3.0|It's cute, but is in no way as big as the pictures appear.  Think of a Matchbox car. Although well put together, it's too expensive for what I got.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|The Hyper 212+ works great. I got it at the same time I got a new case (HAF X 942).<br />Combined was about a 15 degree drop from before.<br />Another computer has a very similar build to this one (case too), but with the stock Intel cooler.<br />My CPU was about 7-8 degrees cooler under load with the Hyper 212+.<br />It only comes with one fan, so I got another fan, set up push-pull, and now it is 10-12 degrees cooler under load.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Pretty inexpensive.<br />- Works very well.<br />- The fan that comes with it pushes a good amount of air.<br />- comes with parts to mount a 2nd fan, if you choose to buy a 2nd one (or replacement parts for the stock fan mounts)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Stock fan is notably loud. Not CRAZY loud, but it's very noticeable.<br />- Only comes with one fan. If you want 2 fans for push-pull, you'll need to buy a 2nd fan.<br />- One of the fan mounting brackets broke. They're pretty fragile. It still holds the fan on though. Can't knock a star, since it still works.<br /><br />Other:<br />Be sure your case is deep enough for it to fit. Kinda tall.<br />It's louder than expected, so if that is an issue for you, you might purchase a quiet fan to replace it (or 2, if you choose to).<br />Comes with all the parts you'll need.<br />I can't speak on the quality of the thermal paste that comes with it. I have some Arctic Silver high-density that I used.
B001DN7IX0|1.0|The only reason I gave it this rating, and we love the movie, is because we accidentally got the version international version where you have to put a code on the blu ray.  Now that made us mad.  We were looking forward to seeing it remastered.  Now we have to see if we can get it decoded or something to that effect.
0670020745|5.0|This book has made a profound difference in my life. I saw Jill Bolte Taylor's Ted Talk and wanted to know more, so I bought this book. It was written so well, that I could not put it down. For me, it was a scientific page-tuner. It was also a book written directly from the heart.<br /><br />This book has taught me to connect more with the right side of my brain. I now gain great joy out of just feeling, listening, and being in the moment. In particular, I love to take long walks around my neighborhood letting my right brain delight in finding all the big and tiny patterns that surround us in everyday life...like Jill recommends, I start seeing the spaces between things rather than the things themselves.<br /><br />I've recommended this books to many of my friends.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book is amazing! It is so full of action and it keeps you on the edge of your seat! Everyone should read this book!;)
B000SEIBB8|5.0|I did a complete reread of this book on my iPad using the Kindle app and a stylus to highlight. Now I can flip through and pick up the important pieces fast. What's more, in book links allow Wiki style browsing of the book! Love it more and more.
B000AXSN5G|5.0|Money well spent.  This album is one of is more recent works based on his acoustic style (as opposed to his electric work), kind of a modern-day &#34;Harvest&#34;.  Neil Young re-introduces trademark elements that have been part of his music since the early 70's, such as Ben Keith's steel guitar, and adds some brass sounds that seem reminiscent of those from his only blues album, &#34;This Note's For You&#34;.  He also incorporates some choir vocals, which we've seen from him a handful of times starting in the '80s.  It all gets tied together extremely well in this album with his own brilliance, and is definitely a must-have, particularly for fans of his earlier work.<br /><br />Incidentally, if you enjoy this album, it's also worth seeing &#34;Heart of Gold&#34;, which is a video recording of the Memphis show during the &#34;Prairie Wind&#34; tour.  It features the songs from this album as well as some great renditions of earlier work and a really beautiful cover of &#34;Four Strong Winds&#34;.  It's a bit pricey, but I found it available at my local library.  After watching &#34;Heart Of Gold&#34;, I immediately ordered &#34;Prairie Wind&#34; and haven't regretted it one bit.
0446547573|3.0|To me, it took a while for the story to develop. Things were a bit slow and there wasn't much dialog. Even when there was dialog in the book it was boring. The conversations were laggy and I just felt bored (I didn't sense any chemistry in there what so ever). The sad part of it was that I started to get interested in the book during the middle of the book up until the very last page, and that was because we started to get a glimpse of what she left behind or what made her run away. The ending is my favorite part although it was somewhat predictable, it was justifiable. I really like the whole \\"Jo\\" situation, (for those who do not understand, it's a friend that Katie happened to befriend in South port)I won't say anymore than that but it did bring tears to my eyes at the end.<br /><br />What I didn't like? *CONTAINS SPOILERS*<br />Okay. First of all most of these will probably be spoilers depending on how much you already know about this book.<br /><br />The \\"Ex\\" Husband:<br />From the first time he was mentioned until the end...all that went through my mind about him was \\"Psychopath\\" or \\"What a crazy a** b****!\\" Honestly, he disgusted me. This was basically what was going on in his head:<br />\\"I wanna beat her and kick her because she deserves it. But I love her and I want her back. I'll say sorry, but it's her fault! She deserved to be thrown across the room and slapped. She was asking for it.\\"<br />I mean come on! First of all, if my husband had hit me and pulled a GUN to my head. I'd kick his balls, take the gun and run and NEVER go back no matter what (use it as my shield!). I'd make sure he was unable to reproduce. I mean how is he going to hit me if my own parents don't even hit me? (If I was the main character)<br /><br />Alex (the Good guy):<br />Alright. I don't know if it was just me but I didn't find him appealing. I may be the only one but I didn't see any \\"sexiness\\" & I didn't read anything \\"dreamy\\" that he did. Sure he was sweet and he was caring, butI want full on chemistry and passion. And he just...wasn't for me.<br /><br />Over all, the book was okay. If you've got time to kill or have nothing else better to do...sure I'd recommend this book for you. It's not your usually \\"lovey-dovey\\" Romance novel. There's a lot of abuse and even at some parts I couldn't sleep because I'd stay up thinking about it (I read before I sleep). There's rarely a 'romantic' moment and it's all about 'her past'.<br /><br />But if you're a gal like moi and you want the chemistry, the passion, the intense relationship argument that almost breaks up the couple...this isn't it. I've read better from Sparks and I had to admit I was a bit disappointed. The ending of course, was the best but it was very short and it required you to use your imagination.<br /><br />Not the best book ever, but it did open my eyes and made me realize that sometimes the person who you 'think' is your prince charming could be your worst nightmare.
B0001ADAVK|4.0|Highly produced quality film.  Very good story, very good actresses combined.  This is a must see movie for Instructors, Teachers and Professors.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|this is a cool game. very cool to see a blob get bigger. the music is very relaxing. the game is challenging
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Super fun. but it is a bit difficult to control whether you choose touch or tilt controls. I use tilt and reccomend it. it takes a few runs to get the hang of the controls but you can adjust the sensetivity and that will make it easier. also you don't need to buy anything if your patient enough to get the &quot;coins&quot; you need to buy things. there is nothing you need to buy.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|I loved this movie. It's packed with action, and while it's probably not realistic to believe that one well trained ex-CIA spook could best all these bad guys, it sure is satisfying to see the bad guys get what's coming to them! He is more than gracious to his snotty ex-wife also. Great performance by Liam Neeson!
B00B9366VO|4.0|Very detailed musical  documentary about the history of this famous studio. Lots of excellent old footage and new interviews. Really seems geared more  for musicians than the general public, but I loved it.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Tom Clancy's latest book is well worth the read. The scary part of the book is that it a pausible scenario. The question in my mind as I read it was; \\"Are we prepared for this type of attack?\\" The answer in my mind was probably not. We face a determined enemy that is willing to use the technology we invented against us because we are too lazy to think about it. For sure we don't have a President like Jack Ryan to combat this kind of threat.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Nice puzzles, great storyline, ample help if you get stuck on a puzzle or task. A great value for the price! I enjoyed this game immensely.
B008NMT684|5.0|My 2 year old son loves this game! He did want more than just the free puzzles though so I ended up buying the full thing, but it was only $1.99, totally worth it. The sound effects are great and he LOVES to pop the balloons after he finishes the puzzle.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Nothing special offered and the free version ads are the type that you would not want to click on for fear of getting taken,
B00384NXX6|5.0|Very nice, no scratches on the disks and the packaging only had one corner with damage.  Great value for the price!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I Love it.  It was bought as a birthday present. It was the best one that I received. It's Great!!!!
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|This is a very fun game and I would recommend it. I spent many hours this weekend playing Jewels Star. I have several &#34;Jewels&#34; games on my phone and this one has some nice twists.
B00A83075M|5.0|Did you ever wonder what goes on inside one of those arcade video games?  How about inside the arcade itself after hours when all is quite?  This marvelous film takes you inside the drama and problems of being a video game hero or should we say villain.  Wreck-It Ralph is really depressed as he realizes that no one within the game loves him or even cares for him.  Fix-It Felix Jr. who repairs all of the damage Wreck-It Ralph does gets metals for being a hero, love, admiration and even cake while Ralph lives in a dump and the tenants living in the building he damages all hate him.<br /><br />Going to group therapy doesn't help so Ralph decides to leave the game and get a metal for being a hero.  He thinks he can do it, after all what harm can a giant villain do whose only talent is destroying everything he hammers with his massive fists....<br /><br />The movie is fantastic and it is a great family entertainment film that adults and children will enjoy.  The CGI graphics are spectacular and the storyline is unique and funny while also containing a lot of action.  There is even a good moral to the story where everybody has a job and they should be respected for their contributions to the whole.<br /><br />The film features some great characters and the voice cast for the film is just perfect.  The real live actor's personalities just match up with the characters of the film.  The film is entertaining and it never fails to hold your attention or keep you amused. We liked it and our grandson really loved it.  Break out the popcorn and set back and relax and enjoy a great film.  I rated this one 5 stars.
B004HD61KE|1.0|I almost never stop reading a book once I start it, but I didn't finish this. Maybe it has a great ending that makes it all worth it but I couldn't get that far.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is such a cool game. When I first started it I was shocked on how cool this game actually is. Love, absolutely love it. If you are a fan of temple run... this is way cooler.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|awesome game. I really enjoy killing time with this one. Eben a little addicting. a lot of fun though. great for all ages too.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|It's Great!!!!!  I Love all the songs.  I listen to it everday in my car.  It is wonderful. Best gift....
B00138CSLM|5.0|Roy Orbison was a unique talent in rock or whatever his genre of music was called in his day.  The album is an excellent illustration of his talent which was augmented by the many &#34;friends&#34; who were headliners in their own right.  I have the CD & the video & no matter how many times I play them, it never gets old.  It is one of those events that I wish I could have been there.  The brillance & execution of the arrangements along with the fun that everyone seemed to be having makes it one of the best (if not the best) rock events ever!<br /><br />Susan Appleby
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|I loved this movie because of the relationship between Alma and Hitch. Watching the dynamics between the two left me understanding that although Hitchcock may have been brilliant it was the Mrs. that brought it all together. It was fascinating to see how Hitchcock was able to maneuver around the studio and the censorship that prevailed at that time to make the movie he wanted.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is totally addicting! Even the kids can do the simpler ones. My only complaint is that with the &#34;one click&#34; purchasing my kids buy &#34;hints&#34; whithout my knowledge so you have to keep an eye on that.
B009YX02T8|5.0|Of all the movie soundtracks in the saga I liked this one the best! Variety of artists is amazing and quality is great!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I didn't expect much from an app whose sole purpose is just to generate white noise or ambient noise, but the developers clearly did an amazing job on this.<br />The user interface is clear and looks great, and the ability to mix noise loops together is probably the best thing about this app. I would highly recommend this app if you need help sleeping at night or just for studying or relaxation.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|I think that it is way to hard in the beginning, but after you get used to it, it is a fun game, but I also wished that there was more time to race, agreed?
B00127RAJY|4.0|I would give this DVD 4-4 1/2 stars.  After going through all 30 Days and combining this workout, morning runs a few days a week, and eating a clean diet I noticed a lot of definition and strength.  I wasn't too crazy about the music and not being able to skip parts of the introduction, but that's not such a bad thing.  Some people have complained about repetitiveness in terms of doing the same level everyday for an extended period of time, but you can mix it up.  However, the advantage of doing the same level for a period of time is that you allow yourself to learn proper posture and build your strength depending on your level of fitness.  I tried this DVD as a gateway to Insanity and found it helpful.  For just twenty minutes a day, this is an awesome workout!
B00BEZTMQ8|3.0|A strange thing happened to me the other night when I watched \\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\\" on Blu-ray in the comfort of my own home. I actually enjoyed it much more than I did seeing it in the theater in its \\"intended\\" 48 FPS. I'll confess I never gave it a chance in 3D for fear that I might embarrass myself by blowing chunks in the person's hair seated in front of me.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. There are still many things wrong with Peter Jackson's first entry into his new Middle-earth saga. However, it was easier to be forgiving when viewed in 24 FPS.<br /><br />\\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\\" tells the story of Bilbo Baggins and his adventure outside his comfort zone of the Shire in the wilds of Middle-earth. The wizard Gandalf and his band of dwarves need a master burglar to accompany them on their quest to retake their kingdom from the evil dragon Smaug. Along the way they run into a number of different obstacles including orcs, goblins, and a strange creature calling himself Gollum.<br /><br />Re-visiting my earlier theatrical review of the movie, I found opinions of certain aspects swaying a bit. The backstory for the Wizard of the Woods wasn't nearly as tedious as I remembered it being. It was actually quite entertaining and humorous this time around. The CGI wasn't nearly as noticeably awful as it was on the big screen, although there was still an air of artificialness to almost every frame of the film.<br /><br />The biggest problem with \\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\\" is its structure. I can't shake the feeling that the film has no real rhythm. It's just a series of actions and cause and effects with no real organization.<br /><br />The high-definition transfer is top notch for the most part. I was surprised to notice some banding in one night scene, but that was the only complaint I can think of. The audio is stunning and will please home audiences with its 7.1 surround sound. You'll feel as if you're sitting in the center of Middle-earth, which could be good on a peaceful day in the Shire or bad if you're in the thick of a battle with Gandalf and the dwarves.<br /><br />Bonus material for the Blu-ray version of \\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\\" is contained on a separate disc from the feature film. They include 127 minutes of \\"Behind-the-Scenes\\" video blogs addressing everything from location scouting to filming in 3D. There's a tour of New Zealand's countryside, also referred to as the \\"Home of Middle-earth.\\" Six full and alternate trailers are found as well. Trailers for \\"Kingdoms of Middle-earth,\\" \\"Guardians of Middle-earth\\" and \\"LEGO LOTR\\" will excite gaming fans. A Sneak Peek Access Code for \\"The Desolation of Smaug\\" rounds out the special features.<br /><br />If you had issues with the 48 FPS and 3D presentations of \\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,\\" I would give it another chance on Blu-ray or DVD. It's a great deal easier on the eyes and doesn't highlight the limitations of the CGI as much as the theatrical viewing experience did. I was pleased with my second trip to early Middle-earth, although I'm fairly certain it will be my last until \\"The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug\\" comes out.rth, which could be good on a peaceful day in the Shire or bad if you're in the thick of a battle with Gandalf and the dwarves.<br /><br />Bonus material for the Blu-ray version of \\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\\" is contained on a separate disc from the feature film.

B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Good app! Good good good cool good cool good cool  go get it its good really to the had it is cool for sure
B0075LTOR2|5.0|\\"The Complete Studio Recordings\\" boxes up almost all studio stuff RM ever released. There are no remastering credits, all laminated mini-LP album covers have gatefold presentation (even those that weren't gatefolds in the first place). There are no original inner sleeves reproduced (so you miss any lyrics and information reproduced originally).<br />Now for the sound. Simply put, this really does sound great. It's NOT harsh (a term usually reserved for having a piercing upper midrange of treble quality). It is easy to listen to. I guess many people bought this blind at first release date and word of the excellent sound has slowly spread.<br />Well worth buying.

B004SIIBGU|4.0|This app is good.  I mean I'm just hooked on Ebay.  I really need to delete it from all my devices because I'm constantly spending.
B0044XV3R8|1.0|Received the DVD's in a timely manner. However, was very disappointing that both discs were severely scratched up to the point they were unwatchable. I had to return them.
B002YVAT72|4.0|The turntable is very cool. It is sleek and very attractive. It set up in minutes and I was making my first vinyl recording within 10 minutes to MAC running OS 10.6.8. When recording was completed and EZ vinyl Converter S/W said it would transfer files to iTunes after I had named each track and Album name etc. I checked in iTunes and yes, each track was there but NO names...?<br />So I had to rename each track, Artist etc. The saving grace was in iTunes I could easily convert each file to MP-3 with a click of the mouse if desired. I have since D/L &#34;Audacity&#34; and getting to like it better and file naming is accurate. The ONLY issue with this S/W is I have yet to figure out how to hear my recording as it is being done, by internal speakers or headphones..?? With EZ Vinyl I at least could hear the live record at anytime. Go figure.<br />But the Turntable works fantastic. 5 stars if S/W was easier to use. YES, I was using the USB connection.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I'm not a gamer.  I roll my eyes at my sister who plays games nightly on her IPad.  Well, once I got the hang of it I couldn't put it down.  I played through all my favorite programs last night while recharging as the battery ran out from constant use.  &#34;Free&#34; always sends up warning signs for me, but I've had no issues.  Love it!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I like the challenage, and the fun of the game. My grandson (7yrs.old) loves playing it too.I would tell everyone I know to play it, and most of my friends do play it.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is an awesome calculator and I would recommend it to everyone.  I like the fact that it takes up my entire Kindle screen.  I find myself using it all the time.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|well written, acted and directed.  I honestly did not expect a lot, but was presently surprised. It was a good story and engrossing.
020161622X|2.0|It is hard to say what annoys me about this book, but I find I cannot pick it up without getting irritated.<br />It is not that I disagree with what these guys have to say, but it is their way of saying it.<br /><br />If you want to be treated like a child and novice programmer, rush out and buy this book!<br />If you don't mind an overbearing and condescending attitude that says \\"only we know how to do<br />things right, and anyone who disagrees with us is wrong.\\", this is the book for you.<br /><br />This book would be much better if the authors gave you the feeling \\"we are all in this together,<br />so let us show you some things we have learned\\".  Instead you get the impression that they think<br />all other programmers are idiots.<br /><br />As a contrast, I have recently been reading photography books by Joe McNally, who is among the<br />best of the best among photographers.  He generously shares all his tips and secrets (or so it<br />seems), and his books are a joy to read and a treasure to own.

B004XJRQUQ|3.0|Quite a story, it is sad to think of the way that power dehumanizes us. Absolute power does corrupt and we forget who we really are. This book is very graphic in its portrayal of people in power.
B007EECSFA|5.0|If I could give a rating of ten stars, I would do it in a heartbeat. This is one of the best reads that I have read. I highly recommend it.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|I thought that the series was better than Terminator Salvation.<br />The advantage to the TV series are story arcs that are introduced and completed, many series especially SCI-FI are cancelled be for you get to the 'end'.
B002ZG9774|5.0|This movie is so great even with xtinas horrible acting.  Love the first song cher does on stage with the girls and bound to you.  Stanley tucci!!!  I want to be in that bed with you!

B002NXOQF2|5.0|I read this book when I was a kid and it was one of my favorites.  I just reread it 30 years later and I loved it just as much.  You just fall in love with the characters and feel for them on every step of their adventures!
B004EPYZV2|5.0|Tom cruise & Jeremy renner together???  Badass!  I knew when I saw renner in Swat that he'd be perfect for a spy role.  Awesome movie and the views from the burj... Amazing!!

B008JFUTUY|5.0|I love the story and grew up with his music.  One question remains after viewing this: What happened to his wife???<br />Please make sure your blu-ray player is able to play this.  It is region locked and my cheap player was not able to play it... Totally worth the money!!!!!!!!!

B000JMKTLO|5.0|That was quite a good story. Love this author. Will look forward to more in the future. Lots of twists and turns.
B004LZFWJO|5.0|My daughter-in-law, I know, DNL, had an app on her phone that is called Candy Craze Sega, correct me if wrong title, and I liked it. This is the one on Kindle that I just enjoy playing. She got the free one, as I did, but then I bought this one. We compete. Remember to keep it on &#34;normal&#34; when playing....I put it on &#34;never ending&#34;. NO! LOL<br />Yes, I do read books on my Kindle Fire too!  ; )<br />Paula
B00B99KJR0|5.0|If you played Call of Atlantis then you will enjoy this app. It is a lot of fun and mostly the same as Call of Atlantis with a new story. There are a lot more levels and it is entertaining.
B00000IREA|5.0|this is a good show.  it is not a Disney.  typical of the space travel. a bit of porn in here, so don't get this if you are offended by porn.<br />it is a little far fetched.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Love to read if I cannot put the book down....The story is easy to follow, and quick to read, binding!!
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Should tell you it's not free first!!!  Otherwise the game it'self is propably O.K  Only played a sample.  Typical mystery hidden object game.  Took FOREVER to download.  VERY large file.  Would not have \\"purchased\\" it because of size and only  a sample.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|i hope they have a 3rd cause I really love this series.  It's great - won't say anything else.  Love it.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|This is an interesting look back at the 50's when psychology was divided between behavior and drugs for mental health solutions.  We all see the world as filtered through the psychological perspective of our own mind.  The story as told by a US Marshal visiting a mental institution has an unexpected ending that ties together loose ends in the story.  The ending is the meat of the story that kept me thinking long after I reading it.  This is a good insight into the minds of the mentally ill.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|what I wanted to see in a weather app. More like I have on my pc. Easy to use and read.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|super fun matching game (like bejeweled) but with a story.  nice graphics and music. tons of levels with ever evolving difficulties.  great game.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Waiting on bated breath for Season 4! and the Seasons to come after that....<br /><br />glad I bought this as I may have to rewatch it prior to Season 4 coming out not until Jan 2014!
B006LSZECO|2.0|This story does nothing but make you lose faith in humanity, love, marriage, decency, you name it. The only reason it got two stars was because it kept me reading, wanting one twist to finally lead to some justification for anyone, but no. Dead end to a dead beat story.
B00846REIS|5.0|Wonderfully written, very explicit and to the point.  I was so happy they had the 2nd book.  I loved it.
B007WOFXB8|1.0|If you are looking for remastered versions this is NOT what your looking for.  The only great remasters are still Tres Hombres and Fandango reissues w bonus tracks. You can find original mix remasters in the Chrome,Smoke, and BBQ box set(must buy) but obviously it doesnt have it all.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Not at all what I wanted to see in a weather app.Just couldnt get it to show like I wanted.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|If by some chance, you have not heard of &#34;A Song of Ice and Fire&#34;, GRRM's excellent adult fantasy but based in a scarily real medieval world. The author's keen interest in medieval history is obvious with the level of detail. Whilst there are fantasy elements, the first books are mostly firmly grounded. At the same time, the story pulls you in, but beware, GRRM is not afraid of killing off major characters to advance the plot and one problem with four books, is that you can read straight through. Lastly the series is a keeper, there is enough depth to merit rereading.<br /><br />For those starting late with &#34;A Song of Ice and Fire&#34; perhaps brought here by the TV series &#34;A Game of Thrones&#34;, this is an excellent and economical way of catching up with the first four volumes. The only disadvantage is that this edition isn't as well annotated on the Kindle as the majority are on the individual volumes (if only Amazon could combine the info between editions).
B008ASGP3U|5.0|The latest installment of the John Rebus police procedurals is another winner. Rebus rubs everyone the wrong way but he stays true to his own ethics when working. The new police guidelines mean he works outside the department, but he is officially retired now anyway. Good characterization and evocative descriptions.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|The game reminds me of the old Mario games.You know with the little bugs are like goomas on Mario you jump on them and stuff.
B004R1164C|5.0|I loved this movie.  I can't recall the last time I watched a movie and felt I was about to be arrested in real life...
1576754227|3.0|Unfortunately, I never finished reading it because I got a job and got too busy!  Never got the chance to finish.
B004UFEJVW|4.0|Good movie, reminds me of the simple but very effective small dialog movies of the past like Dumbo. Lots of feeling and passion expressed in non-verbal.
B0002BO05S|2.0|I am a Christian, and I love watching movies about my faith, particularly ones portraying Jesus' life. I adore Jesus of Nazareth, I find Passion to be passable, and I find The Last Temptation of Christ to be garbage. This one, however, I had not seen yet, so I purchased it and sat down to enjoy The Greatest Story Ever Told.<br />I was asleep about 90 minutes later.<br />I have not finished this movie, and I doubt I ever will.<br />My problems with this movie is not because of it's story; on the contrary, the story is fine. It contains the right details, it respects the source material, and everything is in place. My only problem with the story is that it glosses over many different parts that they really should have included in the movie: feeding the thousands, the wedding at Cana, and many other miracles are mentioned in passing, and aren't shown. That frustrated me because this movie is plenty long enough that they could have put these things in instead of scenes of people walking.<br />Next, the performances. Some are good, like Charlton Heston as John the Baptist. He's like a wild beast, like John should be. Some are bland, like most of the women roles such as Mary and Mary Magdelene. And then you have Jesus, who is quite possibly the worst actor in this movie. I don't know if it's the fault of the direction, the script, or Von Sidow's natural acting, but the Jesus in this movie is portrayed as indifferent almost to the point of uncaring. He just kind of wanders from scene to scene, quoting bible verses, to be sure, but doing so in such a bland, bored fashion, that I couldn't invest in the man who's supposed to be my Lord and Savior. It made it hard to believe this blank slate of a person could inspire so many people to follow him. Especially when he just shoots a glance at Matthew, blandly says \\"follow me\\", then wanders off. No one would follow a guy just like that. It proves this Jesus does not have the charisma and magnetic personality to pull that off.<br />But the worst offender, by far, is the camera work and direction. This is one of the worst-shot movies i've ever seen. For some bizarre reason, 90% of the movie that I watched was either statically shot really far away from the actors, making it nearly impossible to see who was who (and the camera never zoomed in or anything), or the actors were faced away from the camera with really obvious voice-over work being done. I continually zoomed the image up on my television and still could not make out what was happening, and my television is pretty large. It impacted the movie badly because I couldn't follow what was going on, who was where, or what was happening, and I know this story already!<br />As soon as the intermission card came up and the overture started again, I stopped the movie saying to myself \\"I don't want to waste my time with this anymore.\\" That's never a good sign. I popped Jesus of Nazareth in to remind myself how tell the story right, and promptly forgot this movie.<br /><br />Definitely not recommended, pick up Jesus of Nazreth instead.
B002SSUQFG|2.0|No batteries, I really like the strap, keeps good time, looks terrific, I like the heft, no need to wind manually,<br /><br />Now that I've been using this watch for a couple of months, it loses a minute or two a day. That's a pain. I can't find warranty service for this watch. As much as I might like other aspects of this watch, a watch that can't keep accurate time is useless. It's way too late to return.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a fun, colorful game and can be very tricky. Easy to play (sometimes not) and enjoyable to look at all the colors
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I love this app! I have it on my Kindle Fire &amp; my iPhone. It really is helpful for restless nights and guided meditations. I especially like the option to mix sounds. GREAT PURCHASE!!!
B006FO3ERQ|2.0|A very hard book to read. I read about twenty percent of it and put it down. My wife read the book and told me a little about it and sounded like it got more  interesting. I picked it back up and struggled through it. It may have been well written but it didn't hold my attention. I had to speed read it to find something interesting. Boring. I wasted my time. To wordy with every situation being analyzed.
B006HL9G10|2.0|I guess I wasn't ready for this. If you meditate, this is a good thing. But for me, the sounds drive me crazy.
B005H9B44A|5.0|Love this movie one of my favorite movies in the Marvel Collection.  Cant wait for the sequel.  A must watch
B00B92ZO3G|5.0|In this summary of Daniel H. Pink's To Sell is Human, the author seeks to shift the focus of selling, claiming that we are all selling in one way or another, and that the tried and true sales methods no longer apply in a society where the consumer has access to just as much information as the sales person.<br /><br />This book did an excellent job of summarizing the material. Of course, the full version of the book has many more examples and covers topics in a deeper fashion, but if you are looking for a quick read that will give you the key points and the author's thoughts, then I highly recommend this title.<br /><br />Rather than the \\"Always Be Closing\\", hard-charging sales tactics of the past, the author recommends Attunement (seeing things from the other person's perspective), Buoyancy (self-talk, balanced positivity, and realistic optimism), and Clarity (problem finding instead of problem solving). Since we all need to move people on a daily basis, what Pink recommends is a shift in how sales is viewed, moving from a profession to an everyday activity.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Very clear tiles and easy to match up but can be a challange too. Easy to spend time with this game
B007ZD17XO|4.0|This is the game for you if you like match 3!  I really enjoy the 'puzzles' at the end of the levels.  All and all real fun. Once you start you are hooked.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The Misremembered Man - Kindle Prime Version: I am so glad I came across this ebook. I'm not going to dissect this book other than to say the story is quite engaging, the characters are beautifully developed, especially the Irish brogue they converse in and there are some parts that are simply hilarious! Then there is a dark side that is very crucial to the storyline, but is nonetheless disturbing. This aspect is well protrayed without delving into unsavory details.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|will leave you thinking about it for days. Also very approachable for kids (be mindful of the ship wreck scene, somewhat violent). Very interesting to discuss with children afterwards.

B00AU2B0DE|5.0|Got this for my daughter and wife who are big Bieber fans. Overall a well produced CD. Doesn't play like an afterthought of acoustic walk thrus.  The songs stand up on their own.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Very interesting to be back in the 50's and 60's. How easy it is to forget what it was like. It was like visiting an old friend meanwhile the story was gripping. Very very enjoyable read.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Excellent quality visually and aurally. Took the sting out of missing the theater showing. Of course, got to play back the missed lines. Aloha, Q.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|At first I must admit that although a Ray Charles fan, I was not big on of some of the other artists on this CD.  After several plays the mix of voices and styles grew on me.  Now it is one of my favorite music collections.  I understand that this was the last recording before Ray Charles passed away.  Knowing this, you can almost hear the pain in his voice in some of the selections.  Great long counrty road music.  Enjoy!

B00BEPVAV8|4.0|the game is fun bate that I have to speak so many damb words just to say I like a game
B00BESNKB8|3.0|The action in this movie is fun to watch. However, do not expect a good story. The acting by some of the stars isn't to bad but the script is just horrible. I like the underlying permise of the story and would like to see it retold by a better script writer and directed by someone with more ability.<br /><br />Still it is worth watching on a rainy day just for the action sceens which are the only saving grace in this film. If you enjoy action films this is fun to watch.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Great story for a zombie apocalypse , this pretty much covers season one of the show, but the story has some surprises comparative to the show. Read it!<br /><br />The only downside is the price you pay for 136 pages.

B00B49L7JY|5.0|Why is the film “Searching For Sugarman” relevant to a health and wellness site such as The Ganious Report?  It’s because the movie indicates something we all have in us–a skill or gift if you wish, that can affect a grand scale of lives, whether we’re aware of our affect or not.  The story of Sixto Rodrigues, who was a song writer and performer in the late 60s and early 70s who captivated very few in America.  He dissolves into the life of a working class man who finds solace and integrity in doing a hard day’s work, taking care of his family, and actively participating in the uplifting of his community.  Little does he know that across the globe, his songs were becoming the charge for a movement.    [...]
B005VPRFSY|5.0|Bought this as a gift for someone who claims to be as big a Star Wars nerd as I am, but who didn't even have a LEGO C-3PO in their collection. Your typical Star Wars LEGO set, not overly complicated, but a great addition to anyone's collection.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book is absolutely great. I decided to begin reading it after watching the first two seasons of the TV show. It's laid out in a manner that continually gives you the point of view of a different character while still advancing the plot.
B00407PNY2|4.0|This did not have the impact on me that it did when it was new, but it's still a heckuva flick and McQueen is as cool as he ever was.  Recommended!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|So far, I really enjoy this game! Nice graphics and game play is smooth on Galaxy S3 and Asus TF700.
B000BCKFWK|5.0|I saw a part of this vid on TV and immediately fell in love with it. The video I rec'd was completely to my liking! It will become a film that I will watch over and over again. As I am currently writing my memoir, I will adapt some of the narrative features I heard in the movie and continue writing my memoirs in this fashion. Love this Flick!!!!!!
1616550414|5.0|An excellent price for a luxury item. This book is made for fans by Nintendo itself, and Dark Horse Comics made it real for non japanese readers.<br /><br />A true luxury book for a marvelous price.
B005J4ASDG|5.0|This is not the official soundtrack, it is a symphony comprised of the music from the Lord of Rings movies.  It contains all the themes you would expect: the shire, black riders, aragorn, etc.  You can practically see the movie in your mind as you listen.  Highly recommended.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|it works super well on kindle fire and I don't see any porn ads at the bottom of my screen.<br /><br />&quot;
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This is a very good book. However, parental discretion is advised. This is not for every one and I would only recommend it to adults.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I think this game is awsome I cant put it down. Download it and have fun you wont regret  it I promise
1616550414|5.0|Big, with a very nice hard cover, beautiful design and very complete. It accomplished my expectations. A must-have for Zelda fans.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|The book was very well written and the change of times from the current to the past was done so well to keep you reading. Very enjoyable read.
B0013AZLP0|5.0|Highly recommended.  The songs are rousing and exciting.  My only gripe is the beginning of Fogbound.  Someone decided to put in some violins that don't belong as a sort of introduction.  Other than that, its great.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I continue to enjoy this great show because of the action and always wanting the characters to succeed. keeps you guessing around every turn. love it
B001BR5NN0|5.0|Fast ship. This was exactly what my wife was looking for as a birthday present from me and the kids
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My 6 year old daughter and 4 year old sons love this game. I enjoy it as well. They all gather around and take turns petting the horse.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This program is an absolute exceptional one.  Thanks to all who brought this all together from the writer and all of those who made it come to life.  Would highly recommend it to everyone.
B00A85EMVK|5.0|Unlike many movies that were shot in 2d and then processed into 3d this one is absolutely excellent. 3d is often used for depth and they painstakingly did a 3d transfer for this movie. So comments that the 3d is bad are not accurate. This is not 'clash of the titans' ,or \\"i robot' which were ok at best in their 3d processing. They did this one for Imax and it just shines in 3d , in fact the film looks much better color wise than the 2d version because that was put on blu ray in 2006. There's a huge difference in what they can do on blu ray in just those seven years!. The movie is a classic action movie from the 1980's and watching it transports you back to the late cold war period and the 80's too. The music was better than todays pop music for sure and it was varied and fun.  This movie features hot performances from the stars involved too. It's a sizzler and it made tom cruise a superstar. He was already a star though. Kelly mcgillis also shines as the romantic lead. part of the magic of movies is that even 30 or  forty years later we can see people as they were and the woman had star power. which lasted at least five more years. (for female leads that is not a bad run). Still the movie is wildly exciting and the late tony scott really knew how to make a action film with interesting characters. This was the mid80's biggest hit and for good reason. Everything just smokes in this movie. The planes, (some of which are now retired!, just as many of the sailors of that era are now retired too!). still tear up the sky and this was the pre drone age all the way. when pilots were still the gods of the sky and were used for every mission. get the 3d version the film has never looked better. and it can now be said that a movie mastered on blu ray 5 years ago can look much better today with a new remaster.
B000PH40HM|4.0|It's an action movie that makes fun of being an action movie, in a family friendly'ish way. It's very well done and I at least, still find it entertaining twenty years later.
B0076DELIG|3.0|I like Michael Connelly's work. I enjoyed this book even though it was different than expected. Not my best but pretty good read all together.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I saw this game and bought it for my kids but I am the one who has got beach buggy fever. :) It is truly an awesome game. The graphics are really neat and I'm going crazy collecting coins to upgrade my car and get powerups. Like I said, great game!
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|switching clips has never been easier! this gun provides room for 4 big drum mags, or 8 18-mags (not the alpha trooper edition)
B008LC8TJI|5.0|best cd from best band ever. althought the &#34;autorip&#34; feature is a little misleading and disapointing. it doesn't &#34;instantly&#34; download to cloud, it downlaods in 1-2 AFTER the cd ships...
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Love this take on what it is like to be different to the extreme. Wish everything could turn out so well in the real world of bullying gone wild.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Loved the humour and balance of this. The technical stuff was so necessary to the story but wasn't too much for those of us who aren't rocket scientists. The pace of the story and ups and downs kept it interesting all the way through. Good enough to make me post my first ever review. Loved it, hope Andy has written more!!
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|I found the subject to be very directly and sensitively presented (but recognize not appropriate or acceptable to or for everybody).  The acting was superb by all the actors and especially by Helen Hunt who surely had the most difficult part to portray in a most sensitive and tasteful but accurate and truthful manner.
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|The story was great.  I liked the acting and the costumes.  I did not like how it was portrayed as a play on a stage. It would have been better  shot on location with real scenes.
1400069807|3.0|I really cannot tell who is the intended audience for this book.  It's chatty, and filled with anecdotes that don't really add to the general argument, and it's repetitive: it really, really needed an editor. In addition, readers who know much of anything about nutrition or the food giants won't learn much from this, if they learn anything. There are much better books out there: Marion Nestle's come to mind.<br /><br />Finally, the author's parting advice--that people's best course of action is to read labels and make better food choices is a cross between painfully obvious and ridiculous.  Of course people ought to acquaint themselves with the elements of good nutrition, read labels, and do the necessary calculations.  Not many readers will regard such advice as a revelation.  But--equally important--it's clear that this 'individual responsibility' mantra is inadequate, and misleading.  The food giants spend millions of dollars investigating all the fine points of consumer psychology, and thus frame their marketing strategies so that there's a 'gotcha!' effect that overrides (and undermines) people's naive resolutions to eat better.  It's also true that not everyone has the time or the money to implement the better eating plan.  And that's why there needs to be a solution that invokes regulation of the food industry, not just eaters' personal choices.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works quite good serves its purpose. Not much different than a cellphone calculator really. It's pretty much what I expected.
B007P7UF0G|5.0|I was going to see Camelot when it first came out, but our seats were in the first row, so Sue and I left. I have been listening to the music lately, and I am glad that you had the film. I completely enjoined it, and thank you so very much..<br /><br />  Regards,<br /><br />  Stan Schaeffer
B007N5YIUS|5.0|The whole family loved playing it... we are hooked on all angry birds!  This was fun for my 4 year old too to think about how the bird will &#34;fly&#34; differently... not just up and down, but around the planets!  FUN!
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Another Woody Allen home run batted clear out of the park, and sheer fun.  The sound track fits beautifully and can stand alone also (see my review of the CD).  I could also wish for time at table with Owen Wilson at a Paris sidewalk cafe because he comes across in every role he plays as someone who would be the type of friend that would make every moment with him enjoyable.
B005LAII12|5.0|Ted is just such a funny movie i have not laughed at a movie this hard in a very long time.
0062238868|5.0|Great story and an easy read.  I couldn't put this book down once I started reading it.  It gave a view into war that the news just doesn't give you.
B000L53D4O|5.0|My son loves spinning all the toys on the front and is using it to learn how to walk. I would use it supervised at all times for safety.
B0058YPILY|5.0|I love this show. I would recommend this dvd. I received my dvd in just a few days. Can't wait for the next one.
B008I3RARW|4.0|I downloaded the game because it was FREE that day.  My 4.5 year old (who has limited time on the kindle) has taken to it very well.  Its a little weird how the screen flips one way and then the other while it loads on my kindle... but its not that big of a deal.  We like how you have several options on how to control the car, and overall its a good game.  He likes it!
B009CPJHY4|4.0|First, What A Cast!  They are renown for bringing elegance to comedy and humor to drama; and manage to achieve both feats in this movie.  I personally had a little problem keeping some of it straight as things start out moving so fast from one character to another as far as their situations which will propel them to the rest of the story which brings them all together for their ultimate relationships for the rest of the story.  But don't give up!; for it does all become clear and I found it helpful to watch it more than once to fully appreciate the beginning seeming chaos leading them all to the resulting hilarious chaos.  I found in it a &#34;quote&#34; which has become a favorite of mine (&#34;It will all be alright in the end, and if it ain't alright; it ain't the end)!
B007REV4T8|5.0|It s bond and it is a great story. Craig is cool and Badem makes a great villan. What else is there to say?
1401937268|5.0|First off, I have to say these are some of the most beautiful cards I have EVER seen! The love and care put into this is immediately apparent. Nothing but positive and empowering messages as well. Highly recommended for beginner and collectors of tarot decks. Namaste!<br /><br />PS. They're also available in an smartphone app. I have them on both my cellphone & tablet.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I was very pleaed withe quality of voice when it was replying to a question answers were brief a nd helpful search was Also good when directing<br />To  needed websites
B005LAJ212|5.0|I thought this was a great show. It is nice to watch without commercials. Can't wait for the next season to come out on dvd.
B00AQMSJI2|2.0|My son is only 4.5 and this game was just to hard.  Must know how to read to play.  He is beginning to learn to read, but htis was just over his head.  We saved it, he'll try it again when he is reading better...
B0039TD7PY|5.0|Loved the classics done again by two great musicians who have stood the test of time.  The duets are fabulous.
1475143389|5.0|I read this book pretty much having a decent knowledge of nutrition and exercise, I see a personal trainer, and he talked to me about pretty much everything he goes over in BLS. It was a good refresher for me, and got me more excited to hit the gym every day when I wake up. Ill be recommending this book for sure. Good job Mike.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|Second time i ordered a movie from amazon video stream and i can access my video library from anywhere but my fav i playing it on my ps3,,, the picture quality is amazing,,,
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Really enjoyed the book.  The two main characters were very complicated but real.  Really enjoyed the dynamics of the families trying to cope with a mental illness.
034580404X|5.0|I brought this as a gift for a friend for their birthday and the love the series. They were done within a few days.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|We LOVE IT... and we love how we can actually save pictures!  My four and half year old, and even I have fun this this... so many colors and such a variety with ways to draw and create!  LOVE IT!
0316228532|5.0|For a modern reality read - this was entertaining!  I would suggest it if you enjoy getting to know characters and don't mind the raw nature of life.  While I didn't read J.K. Rowling's other books, this was well written and it was a book both my husband and I enjoyed.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|It was done very well and we really enjoyed it.  I do recommend it to others.  I love the history of it.
B0012C27JC|4.0|I'm a fan of his, so I was sure to like this.  Fave song on here is 9 Crimes.  Quite similar feel to his previous album &#34;O&#34;.
B0034JKZ86|4.0|Excellent for older children, but my daughter found the story a bit scary, but if you can get over that great story!!
B0068FYZZW|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and I watch it all the time. This release was excellent I love the blue-ray and the features that came with it.
B0050DZ8J0|3.0|I like the app, just woudl liek to use the job search module while in the app, I can review suggested job posts from LinkedIn but these are never even in my area where I live, they are very related to what I do, but usually not even in teh same state, so I am not interested in those.  I'd like to be able to do my own search (like on the computer) even if it is just basic occasionally.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Gone Girl was a real page turner until the last 15% of the book (I read the Kindle version) - even then it was OK - just got to be a little repetitive. I was disappointed with then ending though. I had to go back and re-read the last page again to make sure that's all there was and that I hadn't missed something.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really enjoy this app. Play it all the time and I have not ever had any problems with it at all. Worth it.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Love this show.  It's got great writers and actors.  Great comedic timing.  I have the whole series.  Definitely a show you can love
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show. The cliff hangers pull you in.... wow is all I have to say... an my wife loves it also.  .
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|I will be very reluctant to pay to see any new James Bond Films.  This was just not as good.  Iwatached it once and have no desire to see it again.  I have watched the other James Bond films several times each and enjoyed them each time.  This was just an OK movie if you have nothing better to do.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Use it all the time for lists and notes... like it!  Very simple and basic, but works great.  Like it a lot.
0385742886|2.0|It was too &#34;over the top&#34; with killings, etc.  It didn't connect well with the other books that were mainly about Thomas.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved the suspense. Kept you guessing. Didn't want to put book down. Keeps your interest. Can't wait to read another one
B00BHU9DUK|1.0|It was foolish pap made with a very dim view of the audience. It is a very thin pastiche from a crass mind only after the money he/she was paid to produce/direct.
B002361MLA|5.0|This book is a life-saver! I don't understand how anyone could say this book isn't anything other than helpful. If only I had this book years ago when I was still counting sheep or running timetables through my head to clear the noise! I hope the author of this book has received many accolades, as I feel she has exhausted herself in every sense of the word to help us, put simply, 'cope' with our minds and use them to our best advantage. A powerful book and money well spent. This book will remain with me forever.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|Beyonce never disappoints.  The tracks are fantastic and great for singing along.  I also happen to love dancing to it when I clean the house!  Great stuff.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Doesn't glitch... shows most everything... use it every day.  No major problems, like the layout to navigate through... easy to use.  Works good on my kindle.
0385738765|4.0|Exellent book.  Kept my interest to the very last page.  I would recommend this book to teens as a good read.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|This is a great movie.  I watch it again and again and enjoy it everytime. The music and images are breathtaking.
0385344228|2.0|I grew tired of this repetitive novel. But I continued to read because I wanted to see what the plot twist was that the 5 star reviewers were talking about. NOTHING is resolved. No answers are given. Just a sad ending for characters I didn't like in the first place.<br />I did not like this book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very suspenseful; even though I saw the movie I couldn't put the book down. All the detail in the book was much more exciting.  I found my self drawn into all the events wonding what would happen next, even though I knew.  This was very easy reading.
B000FBJFSC|1.0|It was written with talent and drew me in, which made it unfortunately hard to put down. But the book is so miserable and devoid of any hope or redeemable qualities, it left me depleted. There are hard books with difficult content that might be draining to read, but leave you thinking and growing in understanding. This book didn't leave me with anything. It took from me.<br /><br />In the beginning, it inspired disgust in his parents. It moved on, leaving me disgusted with his priests and teachers. In the end, it left me disgusted with the author himself. By the end, the deepest theme to stand out was that the author likes to have sex. Noted. Thank you. Those are hours I'll never get back.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|While it takes a little bit of effort to immerse yourself in the narrative of cloud atlas, I found the conclusion satisfying.  The stories show themselves to be a interesting journey through time, different from H G Wells' Time Machine but shown from the same sensibilities of characters.
B004856SQ8|5.0|It is hard believe that they are not making a second part of this movie, i just don understand. It is the best Action movie ever made!!!!!!
0374532125|5.0|This is what every American and European needs to read.<br />We have lived on the continent of Africa and have seen first-hand the destruction of the giving of money.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I find this game to be ok. I don't hate it but I don't love it either. I do like it though. I can not play it for more than ten minutes at the time.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Book could have been five star if it had a clear ending. Great story material with a lot of suspense but it just fell flat in the ending chapter.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|I just like his style of writing so there.  I wish he wasnt so wrapped up with shock value and could mellow in his forthcoming books.  The dvcode was a fluke and was controvesial that doesnt mean his other bools arent as good. Peace out.
B000FBFMFW|5.0|Very few authors can make you feel like you know the characters like Robin Hobb. Not only do you get to know them, but you come to care for them. Her tale is so realistic that you feel as if you're there.
1616550414|5.0|For all Legend of Zelda lovers, this book is worth every penny, The chronological order shown in the book is just so amazingly explained and the quality of the pages are great. I strongly recommend it!
1439190275|5.0|Orderted this for my mother-in-law and she loves it. Hoping to get her on a healthier lifestyle with this product.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Okay, it's a really fun read.  However, I think it suffers from sequel-itis.  It's just not as good as the first book.  It's great in it's own right, but it felt like it dragged a little here and there.  Where the first book in the series really grabbed me and took me for a ride, this one sorta ... didn't.  As much.  Good, a solid 4 stars.  Just not the 5 stars from the first book.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I think it is a great app. Besides the fact you only have like 5-10 minutes. But when you get the actual app and not just the demo you have to have unlimited time I think.
B006XF5BTG|4.0|This book might not be everyone but that is one reason I liked it. There are no promises of going from a fat slob to being shredded in 8 weeks or even a few months. Instead the author challenges us to make a committment to follow him in making some real lifestyle changes over the course of a year. Not necessarily what people want to hear. Though that is what it takes for serious physique developement. Other books give some useful tips and insight into fitness but this is a concrete plan of how to get ripped. Though it is a bit unrealstic to follow for anyone who has a family to raise. Committing to 5 days a week in the weight room is tough to do for some of us. I am not sure I am entirely convinced of the \\"bulking and cutting\\" approach. This might be more feasible for those preparing for the next superhero blockbuster coming out. Nonetheless I found the advice on nutrition, weight training, and supplements to be very useful.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Fantastic storyline! Great actors! Suspenseful and keeps you on the edge of your seat you never know what is coming next.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I gave up on Stephen King after Cujo, but this was so different, I decided to try it. Fascinating to the end!
B005HSL626|5.0|I like it. It runs well. unlike other games that crash after a minute of playing, fruit ninja does not.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|It's been a while since I have seen the original Star Trek movies but for me this movie took the series to a whole new level with action and drama that seem to match if not do better than Star Trek 2, which for me was the best Star Trek movie for a long time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great app, one warning is its really addictive so just be careful not to play it to much at one time. its a lot like the pc version to which is cool. I highly recommended this app!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm only halfway through the omnibus edition and I'm giddy with excitement at finding \\"Wool.\\"  Now, I'm 54 years old and \\"giddy\\" is not a way I get these days.  My pleasure reading is mostly non-fiction history these days but back in high school I devoured sci-fi.  I was transported in the typical teen way to all those fantasy worlds.  Three novels stood head and shoulders above for character development, prose and the richness of the world they created: Dune, Dhalgren and Gravity's Rainbow (not sci-fi but you get the picture).<br /><br />Wool is now in that pantheon.  It has recreated the excitement I felt exploring Dune or Bellona.  The prose stands out for special mention.  Calling it a book about post-apocalyptic silo dwellers might be enough for a movie elevator (ahem) pitch but it misses the fine craftsmanship of writing available in nearly every paragraph.  The ache of human longing is vividly expressed.  It stands out all the more because of all the dreck out there.  I couldn't make it past two chapters of the Da Vinci Code because the writing is so terrible (and I love conspiracy theory plots).<br /><br />Oh, and did I mention Wool is a ripping yarn!<br /><br />On a side note, kudos to Hugh Howey for succeeding on his own terms!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|great and easy User interface. easy to access across all platforms. I can easily save articles, pictures, and documents from one device to another.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I liked it, especially as I am old enough to remember the countries embarrassment over the taking our our people and embassy.  But, best picture?  Not in my mind.  Should you watch it?  100% yes.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Full of drama and suspense, it's a great story and well worth the time.  It is a true testament to the better side of human nature...hope and love while in the face of fear and trials.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Ibi think this is the best gsme ever my grandaughter always plays it on my kindle and i cant get her off it so i sugest tht u install this game now !! X
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I liked the characters in this book and the storyline was great. This series has a resemblance to 50 shades of grey but still different enough for me to continue reading the series. I can't wait for the next book in the series.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It was a page turner and even though I knew the outcome from watching videos of the author, I was captured by his story.  I  recommend it to everyone.
B009GEELDS|5.0|I bought the season, when do we get to see 17? Does it just automatically upload to watch on demand?
B00181YT9S|3.0|I ordered a set of these from Amazon and while they are meant for the US 120v 60hz they were shipped with a European 250v plug. I returned the set and just today recieved the replacement set. SAME THING, shipped with a European plug. I called the clearing house that handles Behringer support/warranty and at first they said they could do nothing but finally agreed to send me the correct plug. This is the plug that comes in the box (which is wrong)<br />[...]<br /><br />Do not buys these speakers from Amazon unless you want to call Behringer for the correct plug which will take another week or so to get.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It's just so great to use as a alarm clock when I first used I'll liked it a lot , because  every time I wake up in the morning it actually workz
B00A77II0U|5.0|I absolutely love this game. It is one of the best hidden object games. It has a great story line and you ain't just finding objects. There should be more like this one.
1400069289|5.0|Thought Provoking and useful. I recommend it for those who are interested in changing a life long, destructive habit. Use of data in predicting behavior is fascinating
B005VPRF0M|3.0|bought it for my grandson and he enjoyed it.  i dont have patience for legos or puzzles so for me it is ok.  for him it is great.
B002RI9UBS|3.0|I enjoyed this book as I was reading, but was never really compelled to pick it up. Some books I can't wait to get home to start reading again, but this one I read on the train only....<br />I got halfway through and felt it wasn't going anywhere and finished 4 other books since....
B004IF8TLU|4.0|Good clean family fun.  Classic.  I could not believe when a friend told me they had never seen it so we rented it.  She really enjoyed it.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|I chose this movie for the name, Brave, and the girl on the cover with that bright red hair... I laughed, through out the movie, and cheered, and cried...

B006RJTEIC|4.0|This is a circa 70's horrible graphics imagining of a future society ala 'post apocalyptic' theme.  The writing is bad, the visuals and models are silly, stunts laughable.  That being said, it has an odd charm that still works.  York is so earnest that he almost knows he has 2 acting tricks in his book, and uses them too often, but tries so hard you can't help but root for him.  Jenny Agutter has a vapid 'vulnerable but loose' (per the age of promiscuity) feel, and wanders jiggling throughout adhering to good adolescent fantasy.  Supporting cast is decent.  Richard Jordan is doing the best with the one dimensional dialog and character he has to cope with (mad dog killer hell bent on maintaining the system), but Peter Ustinov is the only person you end up caring for.  Failing memoried old man who vaguely remembers a simpler and more equitable time.  A fun film if you put it through 70's attitudes, in that day a thirst for Sci-fi (at any LOW cost because of the Star Wars phenom), and the end of the 60's rebellion which called into question everything that you consider 'norm'.  Crack a bottle of Garnache, and have a few giggles at at bygone era's expense!
B00BESM14U|3.0|I'm not sure how I feel about this film. Everyone I know hyped it up like it was something fantastic but I found it boring. I liked the main character, but I didn't care much for his &#34;friends&#34;. They were all very shallow and stereotypical. (Although the male friend who is gay was outstanding, acting wise). Emma Watson was boring as always and her accent kept creeping back into her dialogue, which was off-putting at times. The last 20 minutes of the film were the best and I wish they would have had that pace the whole time. Meh. Can't say I recommend it, but at the same time, I can't say I don't recommend it either. Watch and judge for yourself, I guess.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I bought this as I just got my new kindle and bought a couple of things that came up as 'recommended'. I read half of it, but it's a bit too young and angsty for my liking. I've enjoyed a few younger adult novels like Hunger Games and Divergent, but I think this one is less cross market than the others.
B008Y73940|4.0|This was not a typical lawyer movie.  It was interestingly different. I did not get bored while watching this movie.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|It was slow, in the typical sense of action movies like this, but it did pick up... I'm a Bond fan, and will be till the end or they stop making bond movies...
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|The book was ok but not as good as all the other books.I thought it was funny and exciting as well.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|I've been using this thing nonstop! It has produced much better images than ambient lighting. I wish i would have started flash photography sooner!
B004IF8TLU|5.0|I love this movie because it takes me back to when I watched it over and over again as a kid. I hadn't seen this movie in at least 15 years but once it started I found myself knowing every word and every scene. The acting is incredible and completely believable. All the kids deserve kudos because even know I found myself cracking up and seeing what a great job they all did. Totally pleasurable and if I had kids I'd totally make them watch this film. Who cares if they cuss? They're gonna hear it somewhere. I watched this when I was just a kid and I grew up totally fine. (I think.....)
B00192KCQ0|3.0|Here's what you need to know up front: I first heard of \\"Kill 'Em All\\" and \\"Ride in the Lightning\\" in the early 1980s during the burgeoning thrash movement. I started tuning out on the black album, but got a bit energized by some stuff on St. Anger (not really). I'm an old-school, hair-losing Metallica fan.<br /><br />That's all background for this: If you like thrash Metallica, they're gone. The first cut on this album gives hope that the band will bring it, but the rest of the album is a rehash of the last 20 years.<br /><br />If you came to Metallica via Load, this is great. If you're a fan of earlier Metallica, Iron Maiden, etc., this is pedestrian.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|A#1 Jack Reacher If you love the man, you'll love the book. The action will keep you hanging in there
B0091XRL0E|3.0|When I saw the trailer for this I thought it would be fun, Claymation which I have liked since it first came out... I guess I was hoping for something a little bit better...
B007W7P5L8|5.0|This stand is great ...it works well and is your money's worth.IT may cost a bit.. but it's great and cool
B0044XRIMW|5.0|if you watch this movie 30 times ... you will look forward to watching it again ... It is simply timeless ... the story is condensed but basically true ... and it is the story of good verses evil ... &#34;to join them is unthinkable&#34; .... if this was not part of your childhood ... you have some catching up to do ... and if it was ... you need to share it ... always ...
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I love Downton and my only complaint is the space between when the show runs in the UK vs. when it runs in the US. Because during that timeframe I already know the entirety of what happens in the series, since the UK news blasts headlines without putting spoiler alerts. Because of this I didn't get through half of season 3 before stopping, as I found it almost boring since I knew what was coming. Definitely takes away the impact of the great show Downton is. And I do love the ease of ordering it from Amazon.
1250006341|5.0|I gave this to my wife as a gift and she loves it.  She started reading it that night and finished it in a couple of weeks.
B005VPRG10|5.0|The lego set was reasonably priced and we recieved it quickly!  Thanks for being so on the ball!  My son loved it!
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|i ran for my life. i didjt take no shoes or nothing. i thought someone was barbequing.<br />it was ok
B00B7G3Y4U|1.0|I rented the movie via streaming but it would not play through, I have never had this problem before but it was annoying. So I paid and never got to watch the whole movie.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|I wasn't sure I would enjoy this, but I have already purchased it since renting it and have bought the soundtrack as well. I really enjoyed this much more than I thought I would. Sure, some scenes are campy (must we have two shots of projectile vomiting?!), but the majority of the film is upbeat, fun and has you enjoying the music. Fat Amy was wonderful, as well.
0062014536|2.0|The first book in the series, Delirium, was beautiful. The ending was my favorite part - really bittersweet. Lauren Oliver had this great storyline and she welded it well in the first book. She really should've stopped there. Instead of being creative, she did what every author does these days: created a trilogy with a love triangle and focused too much on publishing short stories about characters than writing the real story. Seriously?!<br />I really, really wanted to like this book. But Lauren rushed the book, shoved information at the readers, and didn't make anyone care about the characters. A lot of them were truly forgettable. She was in a hurry to finish the book- and clearly didn't have a well thought ending. I'm all for leaving things up to the readers imagination, but I'm not buying this bs she gave us as the reason for the random ending.<br />I could go on, but I think you get the point. I think its disappointing when books nowadays have to be in a certain cookie-cutter \\"format\\". I just want to pretend I never read books 2&3.
B003UYUP58|5.0|From the title, you'd think this would be a morbid read and at times it is sad.  But, it is just fascinating.  Dr. Mukherjee is an excellent writer and shares the history of cancer very well.  I could not put this down.  I have an engineering background with very little prior interest in medicine or biochemistry.  He explains concepts well, keeps the reader engaged, and strikes a good balance between the technical, political and social aspects of cancer.  He ends on hopeful notes.  He shows the changes in thinking and approaches well over the years.  Great book!  A must read!
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|Another amazing Tolkien story brought to life by Jackson! My favorite book now another favorite movie. This is a must see.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised how quickly it arrived. It was a factory sealed, original box set with all menus etc.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|One of the top Bond Movie ever made.  Great from strat to finish.  Love the soundtrack &#34;Skyfall&#34;.  The ending was unexpected.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|The whole Harry Potter series was great,  Another popcorn munching experience.  Wish it would continue with the later years. It had a great message.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|my six year old loves this game. hard to get gems though.......she keeps playing and wants to get new horses. great entertainment
B009EEFTMC|2.0|I downloaded this game and it doesn't work.  I can't get it to do anything at all.  I have downloaded other games without problem.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|The movie starts a bit slow, but once they get on the cargo ship to go to Canada, the movie really picks up.  Gives you a lot to think about towards the end.  Interesting, funny and captivatig.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Seen for play on my PC for some time now. So glad I added this to my tablet. Tapping is way more fun the a mouse. Everything I expected and more levels that I first thought.. Tranquil music and mind boggling game play. Just love how the day melts away wile playing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very interactive would love to see more of where they live and decorate. Design their stalls the stables flowers etc.
0545265355|5.0|I love the Hunger Games trilogy and the hardcover books are worth investing in because the will last much longer than paperback.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The twists and turns in the plot kept me interested by not glued to the book.  At times, the characters are tedious and disingenuous.<br />I will read her other books in the future just to see her earlier novels.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|This book was really awesome and how ever reads this next will love it. It was one of the best books in the world.
B0007Y89ZM|3.0|The foremat is hard to figure out! It just doesn't start as most other DVD's. Maybe like a bad copy!!
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Denzel did a masterful job of portraying an incredibly skilled pilot who was also a very troubled man. His final admission of being an alcoholic was the truth that ultimately set him free.  Excellent movie, though it may make some a bit squeamish about flying - especially in bad weather.
B001ER4CNY|4.0|The \\"I Dream of Jeannie\\" display bottle was damaged and the DVD sleeves came apart.  The DVD's are okay so far. Played several of the discs and they play without any problem. I had to place DVD's in individual cases because of the damaged sleeve set. I bought the DVD set to watch them and I'm satisfied with that. The picture card set was in good condition too.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|If you loved the musical you will love the soundtrack. I just wish the song 'Look Down' had a longer introduction.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Many of the challenges in the book are ones that a lot of parents can relate to.  You must be sure to read this book to the very end.
B00AE2J93I|4.0|Great movie for kids over 10. We really liked it. We hope others like is as much as we did.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|It's a classic for a reason, and just as relevant now. I was most intrigued with the anecdote toward the end of part one, about the Hungarian prisoners who protected an SS officer in the woods for 3 days after liberation, because the officer had been kind. A more poignant example of &#34;there are decent people everywhere&#34; cannot be found.
B00B10DZQE|5.0|This was a very good movie, enjoyed by the whole family. Kids love to watch it. I would watch again.
B004LWZVZC|4.0|great story - very intriguing - good movie making....a good choice for a mystery for the family. Plan to buy it.
B005QUQP76|4.0|Purchased this mouse after extensive research to replace my first gen Death Adder. Did a lot of research because I'm not only picky about my electronics but also because I'm a claw/fingertip gripper on my mouse and wanted to make sure I would get one that was comfortable for extensive gaming use.<br /><br />This thing gets the job done and then some. It's the most comfortable mouse I've used ot date (razer, logitech, microsoft) and it fits my hand/grip like a glove. All the buttons are within easy reach and easily reprogrammable through the software. It also has the option to save your settings in the mouse hardware so you can bring it with you somewhere or plug it into a different computer without the need for the software. The construction/weight is great as well with it's aluminium innards and removable weights (which I havent removed any of and it's fine) The laser in it is great with no tracking issues whatsoever (I use a $10 supermat as a mouse pad, nothing fancy) and again the software makes it super easy to adjust the sens.<br /><br />BUT... my one and only gripe with this mouse also has to do with the design/construction of it. ON the right side of the mouse, the part you grip isn't molded so it's attached to the mouse along the upper edge and rear. This creates a very pointy edge which I found poked me incessantly in the meaty part of my palm almost to the point of me trying to return or replace the mouse with something else. I attest this not so much to the mouse itself but the way I personally grip it so some people may not even notice this at all, specially if you palm grip your mouse. This is the one and only reason I rated it 4 stars as some may also run into this issue, otherwise it would have been 5s all the way.<br /><br />All it took was about a minute (literally) of filing the point down with a model file and some sandpaper and now it's like it's not even there and 100% happy with this mouse. Glad I purchased it and if it ever dies I would buy another in a heartbeat.
1451620829|4.0|This is a book that you read if you want to know about the real Peter Criss.<br />A warning though the language is explicit & the imagery is very graffic. I don't recommend this if you are sensitive about certain<br />language because Peter Criss does not hold back. He tells his story how he lived it. If you are still a Kiss fan then maybe you<br />will be upset by the way he describes the relationship he had & still has with the other members of Kiss. It's not good let me tell you<br />but it's how he felt. If you read this you might change your mind about certain other members of Kiss but that's up to you.<br />I found this book a hard read because of the way it was written. I think there are things we don't need to know.<br />Peter says he is working on his emotional state & hopefully he gets rid of all the negativity.<br />Read this book if you are a true diehard fan.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|a good challenge. kept me entertained. I like how clues were not obvious and items could be held on to until deep in the game. you really had to have a good memory.
B00BESJYAY|4.0|The actors where excellent in it. Gerard Butler is one of my favorites. The story was great and the fact it was based on a true story made it all the more better.
B0096HHZGK|5.0|Great movie!  The music awesome! Acting was great.  Great actors. more people need to see this movie its not your typical musical. It's not a Movie with just singing. Its a whole story.about. this musician who's life becomes typical rock star life.totally cool! Five stars from .me liked  it so much I. Bought. It.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like the ease in which the weather forecast comes up.  You can tell at a glance the current temperature and wind chill and then quickly switch to the extended forecast.
0345529057|5.0|All of these books are amazing. Once you start you won't be able to stop. Plus I got all four books for such a great deal.
B002RKSZKI|5.0|If you want to read a classic book, this is it!  Downloaded it for a friend to read on her down time at work.  She enjoyed it!
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|The story was very fun, just a little too much new age for my liking.<br />I ate the meat and spit out the bones....;O)
B00846WWVM|4.0|It was easy to learn and was fun to play challenging as well! I did not like the soundtrack but I never like them
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Read this book after I found out Chris Kyle had been shot and killed back in the states. Very sad that after what he went thru his life ended that way. I enjoyed the book. It gave a person some first hand information about what these people went thru before, during and after there deployments.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Great writing and just enough geekiness to make it fun. A show worthy of 5 stars and a lot of fun to watch. Funny!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This book kept me entranced for three days as I worked with the characters to find the secrets of silo 18. The plot moves along at a nice snap and every chapter ends with a hook that makes you want to turn the page to find out what's coming next. Although the story continues in several other books, which I haven't read, I find myself wondering how long this story can be carried on. Most of the questions are answered, at least to my satisfaction, by the end of this book. I may jump into the next one to see if Howey can sustain the momentum.<br />Entertaining, fast-paced, this is more a plot-driven work than a character driven work with a strong underlying political theme. Overall, a great read.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Words of life and truth from God Almighty Himself....just does not get any better!!!!!!!!<br />When all else may fail you....He is totally faithful and trustworthy!<br />His love is unconditional and He never gives up on me!!!!!!!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was a very touching book, it taking place in a city only 2 hours away from me made me connect to it well. And in my opinion it shows the reader a lot about how to love and live life even when you have been through a tough time.
B00AF6MF9I|2.0|I downloaded this game and played it for a few weeks. It was fun. However, it began to seize up regularly. I got fed up with it and deleted it.
1451695195|5.0|not done with it but a great personal experience.  Getting closer to God and understanding how screwed up we have made it.
B002VRZEYM|4.0|A good analysis of the food industry as it existed in the early 2000's and probably how it mostly exists today.  I would have liked to have seen some details about some positives they see the market and what they think could change to fix the problems that exist.  Seems like subsidized corn is a huge issue and causes lots of the mess they talk about in the film but why did that occur (historically) and what keeps it going today?  That's not really mentioned in the film and I would have liked to see more of that.  Overall, reminds me of a modern day 'The Jungle' and hopefully it has the same impact to change regulation and create a better food industry with less concern about pleasing the companies so they get a larger profit.
B004T4LUPW|1.0|Don't understnad the sync part.  Cannot get it to open and accept new data.  So, I just got another type.
B003NHRGSQ|5.0|Shiver was very good way to start the series but then Linger. It kept you wanting to keep turning the page and just never stop reading . It was absolutely amazing. It was one of my favorite books. It definitely is a MUST read. You will not be able to put the book down.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Absolutely awesome! A must read! I couldn't put the book down. Romance with a little suspense. A relationship that I could definitely relate to.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Wreck it Ralph is a very good family movie.  Lots of giggles. I recommend it to anyone of any age.
B000FBJF6Y|5.0|i would highly recommend this book.  cant wait to read the next one  tears of the giraffe and the next  and the next
0141439734|5.0|Atty. Mr. Utterson is worried, as the keeper of Dr Henry Jekyll's will. The will gives everything to Edward Hyde incase of Henry's death or disappearance.  Mr. Utterson met the hideous Hyde once and does not trust him. Well it looks like Henry's will will have to be executed as the housekeeper; Mr. Pool thinks Hyde hid Henry's body.<br /><br />Once again, I saw Spencer Tracy before I read the book, so I was anticipating a different type of story. I read \\"Treasure Island\\" so I am familiar with Stevenson's writing style but I did not realize that this story was more of a mystery that draws the conclusion and revelation in the end. The explanation of man and his duel personality is excellent and I suspect he draws on personal experience.<br /><br />I also read the kindle version. It was sparse and strait forward; there was not a lot of fluff and speculation from other personalities. I made sure that the text-to speech was activated before purchasing. This helped but I had to keep reminding myself that the names were mispronounced.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0000EYUD4 Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde Double Feature (1932/1941)]]
B007FY9ZWI|1.0|It was great the first few times but after I opened it sounded like a cow getting murdered by a robot. Just terrible.
B008HFWF3U|5.0|While clearly a tremendous technical achievement, this 2CD set is at the same time ranging and intimate in its expression - both explosive and contemplative. I love it!
0451228375|5.0|This one was great.  Anxiously awaiting the paperback, easier to take on plane trips.  Follett is a great historical novelist
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I don't need the proof but this book did reinforce my belief of something far greater. What an experience indeed.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|I don't know when I became a Merlin fan because I was a King Arthur fan before. I only liked the first season a little bit. I tend to like my history... or mythology... to be in line with early records, but this is NOT the Once and Future King. It's about Merlin and I think that is actually what makes it work. With each season, we see both Arthur and Merlin grow into men, but Merlin definitely outstrips Arthur in wisdom. Merlin is the wind beneath Arthur's wings. And he has to be to live up to his place in mythology.<br /><br />If you asked me how a story with magic, dragons, juvenile pranks, knights, and fights could appeal to both tweens and adults, I'd have said it wasn't possible. Merlin does it. Everything blends together so well. It's become one of my favorites. So much so that I didn't even mind when they made an INCREDIBLE diversion from the original storyline in this season. Ah, well. Guess you have to see it to know what I am talking about.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Ha...a little repetitive but the storyline is fun. On to the third book. I can't stop reading them. Easy read.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|It's incredibly refreshing to see a solid Platonic relationship between a man and a woman on TV. Lucy Liu and Jonny Lee Miller are both excellent in this show. The characters are fully realized and interesting. While the show manages to be far more than a mystery of the week.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This movie is definitely a keeper for any gamer family, but I think anyone could enjoy it. My kids (2 - 9) all loved it. We watched it at the theater on Christmas Day and rented it right when it came out on DVD. The kids must of watched it 5 times before we returned it. Very cute and all the little details they thought of were impressive. I think mom and dad laughed more than the kids. ;) I highly recommend.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This game is a great way to occupy the time. The game has lovely graphics and  while it is another match 3 game in the style of bejeweled it doesn't feel like a knock off. It also offers so much more than just the match 3 and win, each city offers quite a few levels and you collect the needed items once you collect all items from each city you then are offered a mini puzzle to complete before you go on to the next city. There is a skip option for the mini puzzles. The music is fun as are the characters. I got it as a free app of the day but I believe it to be worth the amount of normally costs.
0307744434|3.0|The Night Circus lacked a linear storyline, a steamy hot romance, and dramatic tension. There is way too much description about ladies' dresses, clocks, and chocolate mice. Some of the circus tents contained exhibits or rides that seemed like a visit to Disneyland on acid. The red-haired twins and their marmalade kittens were almost as creepy as the evil ageless magicians. Yet, various parts of this story held my interest. The night I finished the book, I dreamed I was on a train to nowhere...
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|the first time I played this game I loved it I like the part that I get to raze a dragon
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I was astounded with this book. You'd think there wouldn't be much you could say about being stuck in a boat with a tiger but Yann Martel does an amazing job at keeping you captivated
B001R3YRG2|5.0|Now this was a surprise - this is a hidden gem, one of those movies you can relate to the character but wouldn't take the same course.
0345803493|5.0|I received these items and everything was great. It was a great read. Everything was in very good condition. And plan to order more in the future.
B0096PYUE2|1.0|confusing, YOU ASK FOR MY INPUT BUT PLACE A REQUIREMENT ON IT, THAT JUNK.  I'm not a talker, so I'm not a writer, Time is the most valuable thing in life, spent doin my wants
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|I didn't think I would enjoy reading another Reacher novel but I must say that each one I read is as entertaining as the last one. Lee Childs knows how to keep the reader interested.
159514188X|5.0|My daughter (15) read this book in about 4 days... she could not put it down or stop talking how much she liked it.  Probably not a book you want to pick for a really young reader...maybe 13 and up due to content, but it is relavent to the topic.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book has amazing detail. I think Ruck Riordan is one my most favorite authors of all time. He really knows how to create and bring alive an awesome story.
B00BHMETKC|1.0|I still have not seen the movie. I rented the video for 48 hours and in all that time I was unable to view the movie. About 2 minutes in, the audio slowed to something not recognizable and the video completely halted. I stopped and restarted the video. Thereafter, every 1.5 minutes into the playback, the audio stalled or the video stalled or both. I watched a total of 6 minutes of the video. Repeated contact with customer support was unsatisfactory. I rebooted my router numerous times as well as my streaming player, according to customer support suggestions. I was consistently able to view other videos from both my personal library and from Amazon Prime selections. It was only this one video that was problematic. I suspect that Amazon has a defective digital copy of this movie and I was unlucky enough to obtain that particular copy from that particular server. Good Luck.
B002PEP4SC|1.0|This book is just silly. The writing is pedestrian at best. The characters are caricatures. The conversations are sophmoric. A true waste of time. Watch the T V show, it is written infinitely better.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator does everything I need it to do and more.  You will love it too, try it.  Has all the basic functions.  I have never had any issues with it.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|kindle fits snug in it. love that i can turn it to stand up or just hold it. even my kids were impressed,lol
B008YRTWM8|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies... great perfomances and defenitly a must see in my book. Those kicks made the movie
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft!!! my friend told my I should get it and when I did.....I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN!!!! ITS FREAKING AMAZING!!!! thought I do wish it had more features on it like the PC version does but IM DEFINITELY NOT COMPLANING!!! my mom gets mad at me cuz I play it sooooo much!!! its just addicting!!! &lt;3
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I'm playing this game on my Samsung Reverb phone and it works great! It seems that most phones now do not allow native App2SD - which means apps HAVE to be installed on the phone instead of a microSD card. My phone is rooted and I use Link2SD to move all of my non-essential apps to my external microSD card. A 32 GB card and you are virtually unlimited for storage. (Well, limited up to 32 GB.)
B00A2BTCM4|5.0|Plays and sounds abosultely amazing on my Acura DVD audio stereo. This is a must have for any Rush fan. Yes, I've sat in my car in the driveway listening to this classic album at full sonic glory. Kaboom!
B0040YFR1Y|5.0|This one of the best Predator movies I have seen. Its full of all the action you would expect from this movie. Its pure Awsome If you asked me !!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|it is challenging but i still have a lot of fun with it! I love all the ponies! I can't think of any pony that's not on there. you should really buy this app. it was worth every penny!<br /><br />Note: This review suddenly appeared through my amazon.com account, courtesy of my 2nd grade daughter. Nice review, Sweetie. Watch those capital letters. :)
0765316994|3.0|Admittedly being a trekkie I had high hopes for the book. And although it did entertain me, I think it fell a little short. It could have been more defiant if it had tried for the serious implication of the premise, or it could have been funnier if it would have embraced fully the comedy side of it, as it was it stopped kind of in the middle and that is precisely its shortcoming.<br />If you are at the very least an initiated in star trek you will find amusement in this book, at least I did, but  Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is still  the best example for sci fi humor.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Hmm, Led Zep back together with the hard pumping right kick drum of Jason Bonham?...Sign me up!  I've listened to the CD's and watched the DVD many times over, and it never gets boring. This is a must have desert Island set. Yes, a desert Island set. If I had to pick 20 CD/DVD to take with me to a desert Island, this would be in my bag. I pass this around to family and friends quite often.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|On one level this is a spectacularly filmed survival tale, but it is much more than that. It follows the book very closely. The attempt of the character as a boy to integrate all the religions of the world is put to another sort of test by the voyage--how to integrate the human and animal dimensions of himself, to see beyond his mother's and father's competing and contradictory visions of an irrational and deep world of spirit versus a rational world of learning skillful manipulation. The pacifist, vegetarian boy must move beyond those beliefs to find the ferocity of survival within himself, the intensity of the carnivorous Richard Parker--his traveling mate tiger, who brings him into a confrontation with the depths and expanse of a larger universe under the night sky and mirroring waves. What the rational and calculative world represented by the Japanese ship-owners can see in this tale is only one of human manipulation and competition, but what the man can see as  greater depths of this story and its reality is a cosmic coming together of dimensions that are archetypal and the expansion of spirit grounded in the earth and the animal. It is not an untroubled vision, where carnivorous islands of the soul float in the depth of the night to disturb us.
B000FC10IO|4.0|I'm still mad about not knowing what happened to the disreputable dog. Why didn't she go all the way to the ninth gate?
B005HIREJK|5.0|Este reloj tiene un estilo muy elegante como casual, lo recomiendo mucho, tiene presencia donde vas. Un punto importante, estos relojes deberían tener un kit de limpieza.
B007XNAQPG|5.0|I bought the Blu-ray and it's amazing.  Perfect picture and exquisite audio.  This is a no brainer purchase if you want to experience the tour one more time or for the first time.  The energy and visual of the performance is fantastic.  It's a gem.
B002NWRMVS|5.0|Sound quality is exceptional, with more bass in the background than her other work. Less perky thematically than all but her most recent album, little broken hearts.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Pretty decent game. not too hard but not too easy either. I enjoyed it enough to actually leave a review
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Awesomely excellent series stands head and shoulders against anything else. You'll be glad when it ends, after 4 seasons, since it is so addictive you'll want to watch nothing else. It makes Hollywood Blockbusters look like amateur attempts. Finally, a tremendous and imaginative story gets the full treatment, such that a 2 hour movie could never achieve. The detail, realism, acting, and video quality are outstanding. Watch it in 1080p if you can. I used a Roku during the day, and my iPod Touch during the night (and no, I didn't get much sleep until the last episode was over). You'll never forget the experience of so human drama that sheds light on news we often read about but never know the real facts. Congratulations to the team that brought this tremendous series to life. It is full of life lessons that are so raw that you'll not want to miss a minute. It doesn't glorify drugs, but contrarily illustrates their devastating effects that ripple through society. You'll actually be a better person for having watched this incredible series.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|its pretty good and fun-ish. but can get a little boring at times. others say that it looks realistic, and yada yada. its realistic in a way, but eh. . . idk what else to say
B004BLDD9Y|5.0|I often fall asleep lately with the light next to my bed on, so I wanted something that wouldn't use a lot of electricity.<br />This is my first bulb of this type, the energy efficient type.  Only 6 watts sounds good to me, after havingt a 60 watt bulb in my bedside lamp for years.<br /><br />Some of these energy efficient light bulbs can be pricey here, and I couldn't see spending over $20, as some of them cost.<br />So when I saw this one for around $8 on sale, I grabbed it.<br /><br />I like that I could choose from either a warm light, or a daylight type light.  I chose the warm light, and it casts a very nice soft glow at night.  Had I wanted a light that would be used in the daytime, to read by or work by, I would have chosen the daylight version, which I assume is more of a bright white light, as opposed to this softer, more yellowish light.<br /><br />I  am pleased with this purchase and intend to find more of these bulbs for around the house.  But I will only buy them on sale, since many seem to cost an unreasonable amount for just one bulb.
0739366408|5.0|This is one of my favorite books. I've read it at least 12 times. Now in this format, being read by the actual survivors of the War, really emerses you into the story.<br />I think this would make an excellent radio play, a la &#34;war of the worlds&#34;. perhaps a new tradition on halloween night?
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I'm sooo addicted....Temple Run 2 is part of my morning routine :) I'm in the top 3% for high scores....
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app works great.  it never has any problems.  it gives you a lot of information about your kindle like temperature of your kindle, how long it will take to charge and excetra.  I would recommend it. :)
B0027MJU00|4.0|A great read, but very dark.  Impossible to put down during the last hundred pages.  I liked &#34;Gone Girl&#34; a little better.
B00A85EMVK|2.0|Purchased this in 3-D.  Movie was grainy.  Not as clear as more modern movies.  It is not real 3 D.  The most 3 D in this movie was on the front of the DVD.  I was very disapointed in this move.  There were 3 D effects added, but not good.  Only a few on the airplane.  Like told before.  This movie was sized for a square rather than regular screen (sized for TV's before Flat Screens.  They cut the sides off, and then the top and bottom.  No much left.  This is such a good movie, I would like it back in Theater format.  After a movie is released and then reworked as 3D they are usually limited with the effects.  A movie has to be made using the 3D Technology.  I notice that they started putting the words \\"Real 3D\\" on some of the movies.  You cannot take an older movie and make it 3D and have the quality as a \\"real 3D\\" i.e. Avatar.  The most I got was a decent HD movie.  But with the picture cropped so bad it is still a waste.  I had this on VHS tape and there was more picture.  Also the volume (depth) of the sound was missing.  I have a bose system and the sound effects are not as good as the VHS.  That is bad.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is in the top ten of the best TV entertainment for all time...in my opinion. I am a 57 year old woman so maybe not who one would think is a typical fan of this type of programming, and you would be correct, most zombie movies that I have seen in the past are your typical B rated type of entertainment and not my thing. The Walking Dead is completely different. The special effects are amazing, the story line and acting are superb, the whole package delivers awesome, riveting entertainment every episode. I believe in these zombies and this apocalypse and that is the hallmark for this genre. I am hoping for many more seasons of The Walking Dead!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I enjoyed the movie. Fat Amy kept it going and the singing was very enjoyable. The last part wrap everything up nicely - as one would expect. A very nice chick flick.
B008M36EEI|5.0|Remarkable romantic comedy but with an underlying theme of faith.  Not at all religious per se but surprisingly deep.  A real \\"feel good\\" movie.
0765334798|3.0|I agree with another review's description of Redshirts as \\"a short story stretched into a novel,\\" but Scalzi navigates the inherently tough territory of being referential to Star Trek and other sci-fi without really ever elbowing you in the ribs, which I appreciated a lot. Imagine Galaxy Quest sans the transparent synonyming of races and characters, and you're halfway there. I enjoyed the first half of the book more than the second; the dilemma resolved itself a little too cleanly, and there weren't many surprises in the last quarter.
B008MEM24S|5.0|We bought it for the kids and they like it... but my husband and I are hooked!!! :) were always arguing over who's turn it is! We love this app!!
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|This is a cute movie little kids will enjoy.  Three out of five stars.  Rent it instead of buying it.
B00AYE8C70|1.0|This does not work for Motorola Defy. Too bad since this was my first choise before Skype. Now I use Skype whenever I'm overseas.
B00A14SQBU|5.0|I do not understand why this album did not have comercial success.  It is freaking awesome!  Mi favorite song is Cease Fire!
B00BMCLCG6|5.0|He stay s true to his music. It is Bon Jovi to the core. His lyrics are full of hope and positivity for our country and future. Not to mention the love ballad Amen! Wow! If you are a fan of Bon Jovi .... amazing... If you are expecting New Jersey or Slippery when wet...or whjat people call rock music today... prolly not for you. His music is timeless and classic! Ill never get enough!
B004HD61KE|4.0|I found this book entertaining because of my fascination with secrets in history. The way secret societies, religion, Native Americans, and our founding fathers are all rolled into one book keeps you interested. If you like Lamen or Dan Brown books then James Rollins books are most likely a good choice for you maybe better.
B005R32L66|5.0|As long as wifi is available, this is one of the best ways to get connected with someone having Skype as well.
1400069807|3.0|Good book, but it's already been said elsewhere by Dr. David Kessler, even with almost the same title. Do we really need another repeat?
6300182770|4.0|This video is weird but we have heard of it many years ago, but couldn't locate it and when we did we thought we would watch it. I wouldn't buy it again for my collection but not the sellers fault, Seller mailed on time, no complaints!
B00BHMF578|3.0|About 15 minutes into the movie the movie stopped, I could not restart the picture.  I had to get out and restart the movie and then it ran without a problem.
B000AGTPUU|4.0|We love this movie because of the story and the message it gives to children. The workmanship put into the graftics.
B007M45PMU|5.0|You dont want to miss this band; you will be sorry if you do. The next mumford and sons or so.
B003M7BLOW|5.0|Always difficult to find a CPU to fit a older motherboard.  Just what I needed to boost the performance of a budget ZT ... good for another couple oy years.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awsome. The new update 0.6.1 is cool and I  can not waoit for 0.7.0 to come out in April.I recomend this app for anyone with an open mind and imagination.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Well designed, but I wish the developer had offered it for pay rather than free, so you wouldn't have to deal with the constant ads
B008NAFU9A|5.0|Recommended by me for a good read. Enjoy!!!! I got it free btw. That was even more awesome. Yah me.
B008I3RARW|2.0|I love racing games but this is not really that challengingI don't believe that it is as good as pole position back in the day
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|As outstanding as the first two seasons ...... lets just hope for a fourth season .....<br />The English are winning the TV wars....
B0089LOKHG|3.0|I did like this series for its recurring action and emotional detail. You start to feel what the characters feel I just felt the ending could have offered a little more.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Excellent book. Didn't need so much exposition , though. It just made the book longer, not not  interesting...the story didn't need it.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|Beautiful music, lovely arrangements and Diana Krall's participation is just sweet frosting on an already delicious cake. Great for listening or background music for dinner.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This movie was enjoyable for those that read the book, as well as those that had not.  Great family movie.
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|The ending leaves you wondering what is left fir lena and what could possibly be next for her...a bit of a slow start but it is worth it. I started the 2nd book immediately
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I love short little books! This one wasn't too short nor too long (I would have liked a bit longer).  I loved the characters and the way the story was executed true most of it you knew before it happened but still worth it!
B002M9WW30|5.0|If you like Rocky and have a blu-ray player you can't go wrong with this set at this low price.  I got mine for $20 on the gold box deal.  While the disc's aren't remastered or full of bonus features, you are still getting all 6 movies on 6 disc's.  Really Rocky 1-4 are the classic's that you and your family can watch multiple times.  Looking back at the fights compared to real boxing, there's no way anybody could survive the fights in these movie's, but still they have great action and drama.
B008469DGY|5.0|If it is raining or the wrong season for playing, this a great way to fine tune your game Enjoy
B005MMJ84K|4.0|Again there was a bit of a slow start a  well a  the first book but in this one you get a chance to feel what Lena is feeling and watch her personality change as she takes the wilds as her new home. The ending however made me jump right  into the 3rd book.
1594203334|5.0|I read this first and forward it on to my granddaughter as she is a new mom. To me is was a less stressful way of dealing with a new mom's worries that too many parents have here in the states.
B00BESCJII|4.0|I sat down to watch this movie with my teenage daughters over the weekend and let me just say that I was somewhat less than excited by the choice, but it was their turn to chose.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by the movie that reminded me of coming of age movies like the breakfast club of my generation.  I would recommend this movie!
B0063IH60K|5.0|reallyy good iz jusst like playing real solitare really fun you should. get it so you can have fun too
B0086HGW42|1.0|I purchased this album and tried to download it. After several attemps to get it downloaded (it kept saying I needed to download the MP3 downloader even though I did it at least 10 times) I gave up. My husband called the help number and talked to someone who tried to help us get it, but after at least 30 minutes on the phone, it was not successful. Finally he imported my songs from itunes and from Amazon which took 5 hours! I still cannot get my album I purchsed on my itunes account so I can put it on my ipod. I give up and will just take the $1.99 as a loss. The album itself sounded great from the tracks I listened to.
B005K17RU0|5.0|it is easy to use and very accurate. i like to use it more than the wc app. it took some messing to get what some symbols mean, but allis good now
1475972350|5.0|Caught my attention right away and kept it the entire book.  Quick and easy read.  Good story with a few unexpected twist.  CHeck it out!
B0067R0APK|2.0|Radar map does not show legend nor does it rotate. PAID for app and still reflects sale banner.  Better app's out there
B00BESM14U|4.0|Sweet movie with all that high school angst and young love.  Kind of a modern breakfast club.  I'd watch it again.
B002S0OBMS|5.0|There is no better pair than Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess, they have such magic together.  The story is amazing.  So glad I purchased it.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Very good book, surely a page turner.  I almost read the entire book at one night.  I wonder if there will be a sequel?
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Love the characters. Love the humour. Just plain love it. It's the only sitcom I watch. Period. Give me more BBTH
1476733953|5.0|I loved this book!<br />My husband recommended it to me several times, but I thought...Internet published...probably bad writing. Not so! I read a ton, across a wide spectrum, and this is the best book I've read in a long while. Great story. Characters that stick with you long after you've finished the book. I was sad it was over. Buy it! You won't be sorry.
B008476HBM|1.0|I hated this book!  It is like a Victorian Keeping up the Kardashians.  How superficial can you get?  I realize that in that era the only hope for a woman was to marry well.  Why promote that idea as a romantic one in our present day lives is just stupid.  I see nothing romantic in the book whatsoever.  The snobbery is almost unbearable.  This is one of those situations where you read hoping it will get better, it never did.  What a waste of my time.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Loved this book, I know it is written for teens but as an adult reader I have recommended this too many friends!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I first started reading the book, I thought it was for a younger audience.  Since it was well written, I forged ahead and continued reading.  I am glad that I did, I thought the book was awesome!
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|GOOD QUALITY AND SOUND, THE MOVIE PLOT IS INTERESTING TO SAY THE LESS. BLAKE BLAKE BLAKE, WOW, I AM A BIG FAN.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|My first taste of LM was thru videos of this concert.  Then the videos were removed from the internet as the movie came out (hate that, it was stupid) so I purchased this DVD.  This is so much better than the movie!  Alfie and Ramin are unbelieveably amazing, the man that plays Javert (forgot his name) is so perfect for the role, I can;t imagine anyone else as Eponine except for Samantha.  The casting for this is just incredible.  I warn you this will spoil you, you will never be able to listen or see LM with any other cast than this one.  The latest movie with all those actors suck in comparison.  I couldn't even watch it, LM is a musical.  Getting all those actors that can't sing was an insult.  Forget the movie and watch the concert instead.
B008M87GJK|4.0|Many times I watch this news app first.  I feel it presents its stories honestly and reliably, and that is what counts.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Wonderful show wonderful scenery ready for the suspense ready for the intrigue and since I know nothing about the Vikings it should be a glorious voyage!
B00511PTWM|5.0|GREAT DEVICE, I LOVE THE WAY IT BENDS. IT IS JUST AS ADVERTISED. THIS IS MY SECOND ONE BECAUSE CAR WASH PERSONNEL BROKE THE OTHER ONE.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|good Coplexity and various levelsm<br />. could use an online feature to rank your times.  this would add to replaying the same games to imlrove your rank.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|We loved the first series and can't wait for series 2 to be released.  Top notch acting, and an edge of your seat storyline.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like this game and I wish I could play it twenty-four seven. When I have spare time I always play it.this is a great game and you should get it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I caught up on season 3 of the walking dead! It was awesome I can't wait for the next episode!
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|The Hobbit is an amazing adventure that I saw twice in theaters and I stayed up until midnight on the 12th in order to buy the digital copy because I couldn't freaking wait to see it again. Peter Jackson did amazing, as usual! I won't spoil the movie but it's worth watching if you are a Tolkien fan but beware there are two more movies to come so the story is not finished! At the end of the movie there is 110 minutes of extra footage from the blogs they have been making to keep fans informed of the progress of the filming, so stick around after the credits! Enjoy!!! ^_^
B0079R8IYW|4.0|It's a simple black case. The stand works just fine. Nice material. Inside pockets, for what I don't know, but they are there if you need them. I would recommend it.
B004S3MB2U|4.0|I needed a calculator that could perform conversions as well as basic calculator functions. The NeoCal Advanced Calculator proved to be able to handle the tasks I required plus the ability to perform an amazing number of other calculating functions I will never use! This is the 800 pound gorilla of calculators! I'm not a scientist, but if I were, I'm sure I would find this calculator very handy. It is actually too much calculator for me, but I will keep it until I find one that is &#34;dumbed down&#34; enough for my needs.
B00B99KJR0|2.0|We have a Asus transformer and this game won't work on it. It starts but after we tap play it tells us the amazon appstore is outdated. It was updated today after having to reinstall the appstore.<br />The game works fine on my galaxy nexus.<br />Can't give a good review if it won't load on a perfectly good tablet
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|Since I like Bruce Willis naturally I liked this movie.  It certainly had a different twist to it.  I would recommend if you like Bruce.
B000SEJHRA|4.0|If you like David Sedaris, then you should enjoy this. It's not as laugh out loud funny as I found &#34;Naked&#34; but was still quite enjoyable. He has a knack for making even his bad days interesting and comical.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Definitely one of the most unusually crafted books I have ever read!<br />Led to a lively discussion in our book club!
B00B23O96A|2.0|This was a waste of money! Title almost says it all. They forgot to say there were a lot of holes in them OLD SOCKS!!! This is the last CD I buy before I can hear samples.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I love having this app on my Kindle. It is easy to use and has large clear buttons and multiple functions.
B0076DELIG|4.0|A little slow to start but about a 1/3 of the way through, I didn't put it down until finished.
0792839749|5.0|I love this film!  This fun, lively musical film is a great film for the whole family.  From the time it starts to the time it ends it keeps your attention fully engaged through laughter, color, music and adventure.  This feel good film is as fun to listen to as to watch.  I highly, highly recommend this film!  I loved it when I was a child and I love it as an adult.  Great film.....
B000NTPDSW|4.0|This was a Gold box deal otherwise I'm not sure I would have forked over the money for it. That being said it's a wonderful set of the three films. I'm only a moderate fan of the series, but I couldn't resist this deal (plus I haven't seen them in a while.) But if you're a big fan I guess this would be necessary for you to own!
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I began this book because Amazon recommended it. I had no idea that it was written as letters. It was very interesting and there was a twist I couldn't have seen coming. I didn't hate it but I didn't love it either.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Like most Stephen King novels, this one was a bit long, but altogether very enjoyable. Next on my to-do list: fan the flames of my love for well-told conspiracy theories, and rewatch Oliver Stone's JFK...
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of scary or gory type of movies/shows; however, this show is so awesome in that is so full of suspense.  I have watched all the episodes and I feel like I've been on the edge of my seat the entire time.
B00AVASSZ8|5.0|Great album all the sounds are smooth, music to make you happy!  I can't enough of &#34;Trouble&#34; Jose will have a long career
1416955070|5.0|I am a lover of YA fantasy, even though I can no longer consider myself a \\"young adult\\".  It is still, by far, my favorite genre.  I was drawn into this series from the very beginning.  Cassandra Clare possesses a writing style that always leaves you wanting more.  I have read all of the books in this series, and each time I reached the end of a book, I immediately could not wait to find out what would happen next.  She is one of those authors who conveys so much emotion that you can feel the joy or heartbreak in the story.  She manages to create a beautiful world which houses shadow hunters, vampires, warlocks, werewolves, angels, and demons.  Clary is a wonderful main character, full of fire.  I could feel her emotions as she discovered herself and her new world as if they were my own in the first book of this series.  If I could describe this book to other readers, I would say it is an urban blend of Harry Potter and Twilight.  I highly recommend it!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Definitely a page turner. The writing is creative with engaging characters and plot twists that keep leading you on. I can't wait to read more.
B00270WH3Y|5.0|Could not pass this deal up.  I loved listening to them growing up.  It is a true walk down memory lane for me!
0307744434|3.0|Entertainig 3/4 of the way then the ending fell short.<br />Recomend teens and up for targeted reading, Fun for bookclubs tat enjoy theme parties afterwood
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Easy and fun<br />My daughter loves this game. It's fun to have a pet horse without all the real hassle of a horse.
B00BLGDFH2|5.0|The movie is fantastic and after watching it I decided to pick up the sound track.  You will hear parts of all the songs in the movie, but the full songs are on the album.  I just finished my first full listen of the tracks and can say without hesitation that if you like rock you will like this.  Each song flows so well into the next one that it seems almost like one long jam session.  If you needed to get just one song I would say that personally the stevie nicks is the best so far.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Fast paced.  A depressing insight into the judicial system especially  for minorities.  Only criticism is that it reads like 2 stories.  One follows the other.  Keeps you guessing.
B00BEZTMWW|1.0|This does not come with an iTunes code for digital download.  Only Warner's crappy UltraViolet.  You cannot put this in your iTunes library unless you rip it.
B001TCHDPS|3.0|I listened to Cold Fact about 10 times before I listened to Coming From Reality.  The songs on CFR were poetic but less profound.  I still enjoyed it and am still enjoying it.  It is in my car cd player right after Cold Fact.  I think he is an exceptional talent and a character that I will always think about in terms of &#34;what could have been?
B000FBJFSC|4.0|Although it sometimes full of sad memoirs, it reveals that life is full of good moments, no matter what the external circumstances of a life are.
B009O2XY12|2.0|Uses too much memory time.  Doesn't last long enough with continuous playing for this reason.  Why do you require so many words for a review.  I don't have anything more to say
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think that this app was the best! I learned all about horses. Playing on the app was entertaining. The app was fun because I met new friends.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked the book, but not as much as I wanted to.  I put it down a number of times and read other things.  So it was not a page turner for me.  Her collusion with Judge West had an undercurrent of sliminess, that left me baffled about the nature and purpose of their arrangement or understanding.  I need someone to explain that to me.<br /><br />  I liked the main characters of Alex, Bonnie,Rossi and Bradshaw.  Being my first Gillian Flynn, Alex Stone novel I will read the previous novels first to get a better understanding of how her and Bonnie became a couple.  I truly appreciated the normalcy that the author gave to Alex and Bonnie as a couple.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Creates expectation and emotional bonding with the persons involved in this story. The ending is not what is expected when the story begins. It takes you back and forth in time which also leads you on wanting to know more.
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|Fund but uses too much memory time.  Same as the above.  I don't have anything more to say.  I took it out of my Kindle Fire.
B00AJLHU3K|5.0|This is a bold album, with self-observant and courageous lyrics, as well as tremendous virtuousity in the composition and muscianship.<br /><br />Robert Whitehill
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Since I got the cd I have played it eveytime I get in my car.  I know most of the words to the songs and i love the lyrics.  This was a time when lyrics were meant to inspire us.  (I have turned off talk radio and am listening to good music again.)  His lyrics are poetry and philosophy, put to music.  I think of his unique voice as a cross between Bob Dylan and Don Henley.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Simple calculator that delivers everything you need and want it to do. I use it daily for all my little tasks and even some big ones. It's my handy dandy calculating machine  :)
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This book follows the pattern that most Grisham books follow.  Lawyer in trouble and gets out of it in some fashion.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|Loved it because it was as much a love story between Hitch & Alma as it was about Ed Gein.
0307352153|4.0|What I Loved: In reading Quiet it was reaffirmed for myself, yet again, that yes, I live up to that statistic. I am that 1 in 3 person, but I am not just a statistic. I am an introvert who prefers listening to speaking, and would gladly choose staying at home with a book in hand over of going to a crowded place out in public or to a friend's party. That said, I was really excited to hear that there was a book out there (Enter: Quiet) that doesn't gawk at my naturally quiet nature, or tell me that there's indeed something wrong with me because I am not super outgoing or utterly talkative.<br /><br />It was quite interesting to learn about how our country is run on the idealism that everyone should be more extroverted, especially in the work place; and it was also refreshing to read about the lives of different introverts, like Rosa Parks and Steve Wozniak, people similar to myself, who shaped our American (and sometimes non-American: think Ghandi) society/culture by being true to their naturally quiet selves. These soft-powered men and women were the ones who paved the way for us quiet ones.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading through the Introduction and the sections on Collaboration, Soft Power, Communication and Cultivating Quiet Children.<br /><br />This book also debunks many myths about how introverts really operate. For example, introverts are not anti-social, they're not all shy and yes, though they sometimes come off as being extroverts they are usually just masquerading their innermost personality traits to make others, like their friends and coworkers, feel more at ease. Chances are there are introverts in your family, your workplace and in your Church. You just have to look hard enough to see them for who they really are: quiet, thoughtful, creatives, writers, scientists, poets, photographers, engineers, etc.<br /><br />This book was definitely not meant to be read by introverts alone. This book is for the extrovert and the extrovert-masquerading introvert who longs to be unleashed into the perfectly acceptable quiet life that they were born for.<br /><br />What I Didn't Like So Much: The mid-portions of Quiet focused more so on introducing us to the aspects of introversion in business and in the work place, which is great for those of us who are heavily business minded, but it leaves those of us more creative introvert types, like myself, left mind-wandering and wanting. (The earlier portions and latter third of the book totally make up for this slower too-much-business-talk midsection though!)<br /><br />Also, though I knew that this book was not necessarily a Christian book when I first requested it, some unknowing readers might find it helpful to know that this book discusses sexuality and uses curse words on occasion, though neither subject matter was used in a vulgar manner.<br /><br />I'm Recommending This Book . . . If you are an introvert who wants to learn more about yourself and your personality, or if you are a curious extrovert who wonders why your friend Sally would rather stay at home on a Friday night after work and read her book than come to your super-fun friend-filled parties, then this book is for you. You will learn how valuable both introverts and extroverts are; and hopefully you will find your place along the way.<br /><br />*I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group as part of their Blogging for Books program. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own.t who longs to be unleashed into the perfectly acceptable quiet life that they were born for.<br /><br />What I Didn't Like So Much: The mid-portions of Quiet focused more so on introducing us to the aspects of introversion in business and in the work place, which is great for those of us who are heavily business minded, but it leaves those of us more creative introvert types, like myself, left mind-wandering and wanting.

B003CFBQBW|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Twilight saga. I now have all the movies and the soundtracks. I enjoyed the collection of songs on all the cd's. Nice price and quick delivery.
B005EWDA9M|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I have the (heavy) hard cover paper copy. Since I had to go on a trip, I downloaded the books onto my Kindle.  Before I had finished the first 2 books I had downloaded the 3rd one.<br />Absolutely loved them.
B000A6T1JU|5.0|An innocent group of guys trying to get to there own turf, while every gang member from different groups are trying to snuff them out, thinking they took out a leader of a gang.
B00A85EMVK|5.0|However corny may it be about the 80's it may seems, it still produce enjoyable movies and throughout the years those cheesy movies becomes classic loveable movies !!! TOP GUN is one of those movies that standout throughout the test of time and with 3D it is simply amazing. It may not have all the gimmicky trickery of 3D but it does bring fresh life to the movie. A good buy for those who loves and can't get enough of the 80's !!!
B0029O08WA|5.0|Huge fan of this saga. Own all the movies and now the soundtracks. Cool mix for all tastes. Listen quite frequently.
B004TACMZ8|3.0|it is not good product.  I try in different environment. The scanner didn't  detect all  2x4  or metal studs even I  new exactly where they are.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|A fascinating story, very graphical. on a first couple of chapter i thought of reading it with my kids (9&12), but further down in the book i changed my mind on that, it's not for kids under 13. It's an interesting read, but slow at times, the ending was a bit of a disappointment for me, but overall this book definitely left an impression on me.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Great graphics. Love the race against time. This is the kind of game that you tell yourself &quot;Just one more round&quot;. :)
B00005AWMF|5.0|Love her voice. Thought she did Miss You, but no. Love her others songs and have been loving hearing this cd on the way to work!

B00APJLFEG|5.0|My eight year old son and I watched this.  It was great for the both of us.  Great movie.  Now I will buy it.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|The problem with this series is that its so good, you'll drive yourself crazy waiting for the next season to start!!!
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Huge fan, wanted to watch again and again at my choosing. Enjoy being able to watch when I want, love the story and the actors.
B003MC5N28|5.0|OH MY GOSH THIS BOOK IS SOOOOOOOOO GOOD. WHOEVER READS IT WILL LOVE IT. THE MOST AWESOME BOOK I EVER READ OTHER THAN HUNGER GAMES
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Had pretty good graphics and storyline, but then I've always been a sucker for a good mystery game. Free version only lets you play enough to hook you in, then it's $1&middot;99 to finish the game, but worth it. Had some trouble with touch screen responses, but that's probably more on kindle fire, not the game itself.<br />Pamelaniz@att
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We heard so much about Downton Abbey but tried it and couldn't get into it.  Thank goodness we tried it again and are hooked!  We couldn't find season 2 or 3 anywhere but finally found it on Amazon Prime.  We watch at least two shows a night so hopefully we'll be caught up by the time season 4 starts!
B003RV43X4|4.0|This is a very well done movie.  There is a lot of violence, it is the story so I would not recommend this for any kids under 16.
0345803493|5.0|This is a great series. Easy to become addicted.  I read the book in just a couple days.  Keeps your attention.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Great game! Keeps you occupied & interested. Only bad thing is that I finished the game in like 4 hours. I have played The Haunt which is excellent. Very similar to this game but a little harder and longer took me about 2 weeks to complete.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Mahjohg is fun no matter what. The variety of boards and tiles definitely keeps it interesting, and this game includes tiles I have ot seen before.
B00B99KJR0|1.0|I have tried 3 times and rebooted my fire twice - still says there is an error on install please try again.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|a quick and easy calc. I don't do much high math but this is easy a quick. It is good for work too so i don't have to use my phone
0765325950|5.0|This was a Christmas Gift. Of course the book was not released until January 8th so I Pre-Ordered the Book. I love that I can do that.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I say &#34;almost&#34; because you do have to consider moves and spacial relationships, but you don't have to ponder every single move.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|The second season of Game of Thrones is just a wonderful to watch as the first season.  My wife and I can not wait for the next DVD to come out.
B0030MM68O|5.0|The first time viewing this movie it was pretty intense. The second viewing didn't have that air to it, of course, but the wife wanted to see it.
1878424505|5.0|Sin palabras. Hay que leerlo y además ponerlo en práctica para lograr un cambio sustancial en nuestra vida. Es un libro para leer y re-leer...
B00AA0U05A|5.0|Heard Emmy Rossum on a television show.  She sang without auto-tune or any other artifice.  She is simply wonderful and I only wish she would do another album with older jazz type songs.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Small kids enjoyed story.  Parents enjoyed it too.  Some adult humor.  Had a good message of believing in the good of people.
B00ARAN9JW|3.0|I was disappointed, because the sequels keep spinning off from itself, but remaining stagnant in the telling. Too many movies within a movie, within a movie. It's way old to keep taking this route. How about starting with a fresh story, rather than keep telling the same one?
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I have had this book for years but never got around to reading it.  Finally, after seeing the movie ads, I decided to just do it.  Downloaded it to my Kindle and thoroughly enjoyed the book.  Would recommend it to anyone.
1592407889|5.0|This book isn't anything I had anticipated.  I've been a Shirley MacLaine fan for years.  I've bought every book she's written, but this book has the ring of truth.  It has caused me to wonder about Ms. MacLaine.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|This movie has an interesting storyline and graphic scenes.  The end has a good message, sacrifice for the ones you love.
B00APUQT7I|3.0|I'm no movie critic. The movie was ok for an animation. 3 out of 5 stars, because it wasn't mind blowing good.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|It was so engaging and adveturous I could not stop.  I would have liked a sequel ha ha! but I will definetely look for some more books from this writer.
1594488886|5.0|I've never read a book that touched me this deep. It talks about a woman's struggle in life... it is filled with strong emotions that make you create this bond with the character. I remember crying in many parts.. I talk about this book all the time.. and I bought it as a gift for some of my friends.<br /><br />It is DEFINITELY a MUST READ. It makes me can't wait for Khaled Hosseini's next book in May. His writing style is just so different from anyone else. And his books has a unique splendid taste that makes you wish they are so long that you'd never reach an ending.<br /><br />I wrote down some of my favorite quotes from this book, which I found so touching and inspiring.. I go back to read them often... they give me goosebumps everytime I read those words...<br /><br />- Learn this now and learn it well, my daughter: Like a compass needle that points north, a man's accusing finger always finds a woman. Always.<br />- He liked the enchanting sounds the Arabic words made as they rolled off his tongue. He said they comforted him, eased his heart. \\"You can summon them in your time of need, and they won't fail you. God's words will never betray you.\\"<br />- Mariam always held her breath as she watched him go. She held her breath and, in her head, counted seconds. She pretended that for each second that she didn't breathe, God would grant her another day with Jalil.<br />- Behind every trail and every sorrow that he makes us shoulder, God has a reason.<br />- She remembered Nana saying once that each snowflake was a sigh heaved by an aggrieved woman somewhere in the world. That all the sighs drifted up the sky, gathered into clouds, then broke into tiny pieces that fell silently on the people below. As a reminder of how women like us suffer, she'd said. How quietly we endure all that falls upon us.<br />- She saw clearly how much a woman could tolerate when she was afraid. And she was afraid. She lived in fear of his shifting moods, his volatile temperament, and his insistence on steering even mild exchanges down a confrontational path.<br />- Laila had learned a fundamental truth about time: Like the accodrion on which Tariq's father sometimes played old Pashto songs, time stretched and contracted depending on Tariq's absence or presence.<br />- Laila came to believe that of all the hardships a person had to face non was more punishing than the simple act of waiting.<br />- Boys, Laila came to see, treated friendship the way they treated the sun: its existence undisputed, its radiance best enjoyed, not beheld directly.<br />- She would never leave her mark on Mammy's heart the way her brothers had, because Mammy's heart was like a pallid beach where Laila's footprintes would forever wash away beneath the waves of sorrow that swelled and crashed, swelled and crashed.<br />- She remembered all too well how time had dragged without him, how she had shuffled about feeling waylaid, out of balance. How would she ever cope with his permanent absence?<br />- There would come a day in fact, years later, when Laila would no longer bewail his loss. Or not as relentlessly, not nearly. There would come a day when the details of his face would become to slip from memory's grip, when overhearing a mother on the street call after her child by Tariq's name would no longer cut her adrift. She would not miss him as she did now, when the ache of his absence was her unremitting companion- like the phantom pain of an amputee.<br />- 'One could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs,<br />Or the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls'.<br />- And for the first time, it was not an adversary's face Laila saw but a face of grievances unspoken, burdens gone unprotested, a destiny submitted to and endured. If she stayed, would this be her own face, Laila wondered, twenty years from now?<br />- Her eyes watered, her heart took flight. And she marveled at how, after all these years of rattling loose, she had found in this little creature the first true connection in her life of false, failed connections.<br />- Mariam had hardly noticed, hardly cared. She had passed these years in a distant corner of her mind. A dry, barren field, out beyond wish and lament, beyond dream and disillusionment. There, the future did not matter. There, the past held only this wisdom: that love was a damaging mistake, and its accomplice, hope, a treacherous illusion. And whenever those twin poisonous flowers began to sprout in the parched land of that field, Mariam uprooted them. She uprooted them and ditched them before they took hold.<br />- She didn't dare. She didn't dare move a muscle. She didn't dare breathe, or blink even, for fear that she was nothing but a mirage shimmering in the distance, a brittle illusion that would vanish at the slightest provocation. Laila stood perfectly still and looked at Tariq until her chest screamed for air and her eyes burned to blink. And somehow, miraculously, after she took a breath, closed and opened her eyes, he was still standing there. Tariq was still standing there. Laila allowed herself to take a step toward him. Then another. And another. And then she was running.<br />- Mariam saw now in those same eyes what a fool she had been. Had she been a deceitful wife? she asked herself. A complacent wife? A dishonorable woman? Discreditable? Vulgar?<br />What harmful thing had she willfully done to this man to warrant his malice, his continual assaults, the relish with which he tormented her? Had she not looked after him when he was ill? Fed him, and his friends, cleaned up after him dutifully?<br />Had she not given this man her youth? Had she ever justly deserved his meanness?<br />- And yet she was leaving the wold as a woman who had loved and been loved back. She was leaving it as a friend, a companion, a guardian. A mother. A person of consequence at last. No. It was not so bad, Mariam thought, that she should die this way. Not so bad. This was a legitimate end to a life of illegitimate beginnings.<br /><br />Dima Faris Omarhe first true connection in her life of false, failed connections.<br />- Mariam had hardly noticed, hardly cared.

B00A3T5CGU|1.0|This application is ok for the average navigation. I live in New York and take public transportation and that isn't an option here. Very disappointing.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Good story and very easy. Keep wanted to see what happened to see there was a happy ending. Full of surprises.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|My son is 2 and instantly caught on to the game. There are 5 games for each letter including building the letter, building an animal that starts with that letter, and matching games. Overall fantastic game that has really helped my son identify his letters! Would recommend for any toddler!
030758836X|5.0|This book is so captivating. Everything about it is just so captivating. Starting with the cover, the title, first couple of paragraphs and ending with the last page. It is a page turner that is twisted in a unique way.. you'd sleep, wake up, eat, talk, and think Gone Girl!<br /><br />I will always remember this: 'When I think of my wife, I always think of her head. The shape of it, to begin with.'<br /><br />I remember the effect that this sentence had on me, and how it made me want to read more, know more, and never stop.<br /><br />I just loved the way this book describles a bad - unstable marriage, I also loved the sequence of events and the way the author makes you go between the past - her version of event, and the present - his version of event. Until they both meet in one point. The book ends in a way that you would never expect.. and I hope there is part 2. Gone Girl - part 2. I'd be the first one to buy it!<br /><br />My only problem with this book however, is that now my standard is getting higher when it comes to the psychology thriller category. It raised the bar too high. Whenever I read a book, i keep thinking, but it is not the 'Gone Girl'.<br /><br />I hope Gillian will write another book. This book will stay in the memory for years to come. It is definitely the book of 2012.<br /><br />Dima Faris Omar
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Awesome game. Went pretty fast but again, it was awesome. Have as much as I did with it! (two more words required, BOOM, got em now)
B002LC8HF0|5.0|If I could rate it a 4.5, that would be more appropriate. Capitivating. Enough twists to keep me guessing. Some light religious philosophy to go along with an excellent fantasy adventure.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I was excited to play this game but when I try to open it, it starts to download an update then closes when done. tried uninstalling and reinstalling but same problem.
0316223239|5.0|When I think about this book it makes me scream ... 'CREATIVE'<br /><br />I was often thinking while reading those pages.. how can an author be thinking with the mind of a 5 year old boy and talking with his language. And how can a reader get this attached to a novel that is narrated by a 5 year old boy.<br /><br />Then I explained it with one word... creativity.<br /><br />This is creativity at its finest. It is a uniqe book that can be seen as a piece of art. One that would stay in the memory for years and years to come.<br /><br />Highly recommended for those who did not read it yet!<br /><br />Dima Faris Omar
B004OC07F8|5.0|What they write is something that anyone who wants to innovate in business should consider.<br />It is a good challange with a lot of possibilities of success
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|It moves along nicely. Not totally predictable. A good adventure. Enough main characters to keep it interesting while not so many that you lose track.
0385512104|3.0|This author has Asperger's syndrome. I was interested in learning how the author thinks. The story is hard to follow and not as descriptive as I am accustom. However, if you want to step into the life of someone with Asperger's syndrome this is your book.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|I have a Sprint Samsung Galaxy S3 that normally does very well for it's battery life. As soon as I installed this game my battery life was reduced, probably by about 75%. I love the game, but it SLAUGHTERS my battery. Probably. Maybe someone can help? There aren't many bad reviews for this game so I've gotta believe it's just me. When I reset my phone, even if I haven't played the game at all it says \\"Osmos HD has crashed.\\" Why is Osmos trying to run in the background?<br /><br />The game is great and fun and all, but I can barely afford to have it installed on my phone in light of what it does to my battery!
B00AFEY354|5.0|This movie was moving, emotional, touching, relate-able, entertaining, fantastic, heart-warming, and all around a great flick. I would recommend it to anyone.
B0013USZHG|5.0|This disk has a variety of moods of South American music, played expertly and passionately by an orchestra that I would never have guessed is a &#34;youth&#34; orchestra. Top notch!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|It was a process to download, the game was okay but not all numbers would mark after I hit it. I never received my 20 bonus credits for downloading and the high stakes tournament room will not unlock.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This series of books was both entertaining and more than interesting. I need another book to pick up where this one ended.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book and look forward to reading the rest of the trilogy. This is a futuristic look at what could be the way we might survive the world economy.  I hope we never have to survive in our world like the main character s had to.
B00170I7GG|5.0|Such a funny movie. Bill Murray at his best.<br />Non-stop laughing. Thought provoking. Very good story.<br />I recommend watching this movie.
B000002VCQ|5.0|I will always be a Whitney fan no matter what.  I been saying for the longest I was going to purchase this cd and now I have.  I have already listened to it.
B004SDEP38|1.0|It doesn't do anything. what's the purpose of it<br />trying to create a doc says you need to buy full version. a bunch of nothing if you ask me. it just says you need to buy more don't download it
1476733953|5.0|I'm sure there's not much I can bring to the table after nearly four thousand reviews.  Just know it was worth the five stars.  I INHALED this book, and nearly cried aloud when the focus switched from the semi-cliffhanger of one character to a new chapter from a different POV.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A down home Texas look at what it's like to be the best sniper in American history. A look inside what happens to the family of a true  patriot
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I choose this rating because the action was always going and you didn't get stuck with all the talking. So when you turned the page you had to keep turning or you feel like you going to miss the parts of the book's
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is one of the best games that I have on my Kindle Fire! It's so much fun. It's worth five stars and then some. The graphics are terrific! Everything is soooo realistic. As a child,I had always loved horses,and wished that I had one. I think that this is as close to the real thing,in a game, that anyone, adult or child can get to. Anyone of any age will love playing My Horse!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We were not too hip on the ending and thought this could have been a series finale but we are still geared up to watch Season 4 when it comes out.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|A movie too long, too loud and too 'LOTR'. Given this and 'King Kong' PJ seems to have come away from 'LOTR' with the firm conviction that nothing succeeds like excess. More length, more action, more orcs, more hairbreadth (and, to be honest, harebrained) escapes. He really has tried to turn the Don's sweet sad little book into an epic to match 'LOTR'. But this time a lot of his additions and changes (except for bringing in the Necromancer and the prologue to the War of the Ring) don't really work. They look more like padding. I reeeally got tired of hordes of orcs showing up everywhere for more mind-numbing ear-busting CGI action, and the obligatory Miracle Rescue by the Eagles. Being a bit of a Ringer myself, I'm still irritated at PJ's separating orcs from goblins, when all the goblins were, were early versions of orcs, before Tolkein renamed them. Kept seeing bits of 'Fellowship' and 'Return' here, thinly re-imagined, especially in the goblin's caverns, and double-especially when they go riding on collapsing bridges just like the stairs in Moria with zillions of goblins nipping at their heels. AGAIN. I can see why del Toro opted out. In the late 60's Rankin-Bass did an animated 'Hobbit' that I much prefer. It starred Orson Bean as Bilbo, John Huston as Gandalf, Richard Boone as a truly nasty Smaug, and some creep named Brother Theodore as Gollum, who, unlike Andy Serkis, remembered how Gollum got his name, and it wasn't from an asthmatic cough. They got the whole story done in an hour and a half, and did right by it. And unlike the trilogy, I CAN wait a year for the next episode.
1601251505|5.0|Solid book, very quality made. Could probably knock out a raging horde of goblins with it no problem. great buy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love my horse it just gave me 20 gems for playing it I would give it five stars.Love it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We did like Season 1 better but this was still great! We did like it enough to  purchase Season 3.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my mother, who is a lifelong and obsessed fan. A must-have for any true Trekie.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|the entire hunger games s**** on twilight one. by. one. loved hunger games 1, 2 and 3. like how twilight is for baby teens, hunger games is for late teens/early 20s. good story.
B003DKJ5ZU|3.0|The bluray dvd was in great condition but the dvd was badly damaged. I wish the dvd would have been listed as damaged was interested in both the bluray dvd and the dvd of the great fairy rescue, not just the bluray dvd.
0882709194|1.0|This copy has been edited by Ray Comfort, a delusional christian nut job. He tries to insert creationism and flawed/failed intelligent design in this book. Do not buy this version!!
B002Z0TPFE|5.0|I'm pretty much a typical guy who likes lots of action and special effects in my movies and this one delivered on both counts.
B0015DYIH2|4.0|they go into soooo much detail. but this isnt a place to talk about the book but about the seller. got this book in 5 secs.
B0096HKZ1M|5.0|This movie is great and i really enjoyed watching it again.  I had no issues with the streaming of the video
B000NI8F5G|5.0|We recently have been watching old musical with our kids. We knew that this was a classic so gave it a spin. The kids loved it. The singing and dancing are fantastic and it has a good story. One of the best musical movies out there.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|Terrible storyline and entirely cliche. The review by Allegra Skye includes a list of names. I wouldn't pair this author with any of them except for Christopher Paolini in terms of unoriginality. The entire plot-line in one sentence: A boy has a terrible life until age 14 when a bunch of good, miraculous, and amazing things begin to happen to him. Sound like an interesting read? I'd think not. You could draw a straight line with this plot. Definitely should not be compared to George RR Martin. You will not find that kind of depth of plot.
B009X012XM|1.0|Does Not Stand Very Long Before It Falls Flat<br />Face Cover - Poorly Made<br /><br />Stay Away From It - Buy An Amazon  Bland Case
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I've finally finished the game and it was great.The game had great hidden objects games,everything I collected was used to complete a chapter in the game. Great voice interaction with the characters.this game is well worth buying.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The item was just as described the kids like it. I will purchase from this company in the future, thank you.
B006TJXZ30|5.0|I don't always like logging on to my personal computer, but thanks to this app I can log on easily without the whole typing in MSN and everything just to get to my email.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Comes with everything including blu-ray, dvd, and digital download. couldnt ask for much more.  Great product, have to order season 1 soon
B00992CF6W|4.0|I really like minecraft, but I found one big problem NOBODY CAN COME TO MY WORLD I have the kindle fire second edition and I can't let anyone come to my world. So if you have a kindle fire second edition and you want this game, make sure you don't want people coming to your world
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This is one of the best games for children. It is cute and is very entertaining for children and adults
B00632HWOG|5.0|Again, I love the fact that I don't have to log on to my PC just to check my email. That app is great to have if you have a Yahoo Email account.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I found this novel to be a little slow moving but I stayed with it and it was worth the wait.
B00000DGUY|4.0|I love Dire Straights. I was pleased to be able to buy a best-of CD of their songs.<br /><br />But- I am not fond of the fact that some of the songs on this are edited... just like I am not keen on buying the music video DVD when the \\"Walk of Life\\" video is the stupid sports-bloopers USA one rather than the brilliant one that was filmed in the London Underground.<br /><br />I'm only giving it 4 stars because their music is that good. I HATE the pandering editing.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|Every level has 30 sec video commerical that you can't escape . Game play is eh, but its nothing but adware now which steals info and loads commericals and ads every level. Don't DOWNLOAD, SCAM
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Excellent. History was very interesting especially dealing with the fighting on the eastern front. Characters meshed well together.Labor situation was very informative.
B007CGU34I|5.0|I bought this book to replace (the one my minivan damaged) a book checked out from my child's chool. It was in perfect condition! Thank you!!
0446580848|3.0|I would love to say this was a great book, but unfortunately that's not the case. It delivers all of the smart-ass nonsense one expects from John Corey, but it completely wasted Paul Brenner -- and maybe that's because those two are nearly identical. Perhaps it's time for Mr. DeMille to back off of the Corey character, and go a completely different direction.<br /><br />I've been a fan of Nelson DeMille for many years now, and I would hate to see him get bogged down in what struck me as automatic writing. Yes, all of his lead characters are smart-asses. And that's fine, I enjoy that. If I didn't, I wouldn't like any of his books, and that's not the case. But Corey came off as more irritating than funny and, as I said, Brenner was wasted. I'd been looking forward to seeing that character again, but he was barely there. There's only room for one alpha male lead in a DeMille novel, and it wasn't Brenner's turn.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|This movie was a let down, and certainly the worst of Daniel Craig's bond movies (or of Javier Bardem). It was lacking in action (more drama, less action), and missing on all the regular bond gadgets and bond one-liners. MI6 may have been cutting its budget, but why did the producers of the film have to?
B007HACDLK|4.0|Good book. Ending a little too quick.Book is for fans of Vince Flynn and those who like action packed novels.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This note program is great! It's well designed and easy to use. I like that you can reuse your checklists instead of having to create a new one every time, and I like the color coding, and I like that you can have checklists and text notes. Truly a great app! I use it every day!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|My daughter and I love to play this game.  We like to challenge each other.  We really like this updated version too.  Keep it coming.  Lots of fun.
B0034G4OYK|5.0|I pre-ordered this combo pack for my daughter since she loved it so much. I loved how it arrived the same day it hit the shelves and how great condition it came in.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and felt everything was fairly plausible with the exception of the economics and politics involved. Didn't quite believe that the money required could actually happen in today's world. It was an exciting read though, and kept me engaged to the end.  If you've enjoyed any of Ben Bova's books, you'll love this one.
B004U8VUUC|4.0|I watched this movie late one evening, not really knowing what I was getting into. I couldn't stop watching it, as it's similar to a train wreck: very disturbing yet captures your attention to the point where you can't turn away. It is a well acted, solid script. The fact that it's based on a true story makes it even more disturbing yet intriguing to watch. Ryan Gosling did an excellent job in the lead role. However, if you're expecting to see him in another love story like the Notebook, you will be sorely mistaken. This movie is dark, but it grabs your attention and makes you think about being more cautious when it comes to love and relationships.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Very worth every dime paid for this DVD collection. The only complaint is it doesn't have the original music, but it certainly does not take away from the experience.
B00BGDF1FO|5.0|I was sold on the soundtrack pretty much as soon as Rules of Nature kicked in during the Metal Gear RAY fight.<br /><br />It strikes a perfect blend between alt. rock/metal and electronic, which is normally a mixture I'd step away from. But Christopherson does a marvellous job combining these elements.<br /><br />Highlights are pretty much all the boss themes (Rules of Nature and A Stranger I Remain especially), Dark Skies and The War Still Rages Within.<br /><br />The downside to this album is it lacks the incredible instrumental-to-vocals mixing that the game offers, but a bit of judicial audio editing will solve that.
B0010T0QO0|5.0|I bought these one size larger than I normally wear because I read a bunch of reviews saying that they run small and that they make your feet sweat if you don't allow extra room. That was a huge mistake. I now have giant white clown shoes. The shoes themselves are awesome. They are nice and wide (which is why I bought them) and the nonskid bottoms work great in the kitchen. I see a lot of people complaining about the ventilation, but that is actually a feature IMO. The first time you spill a pot full of boiling soup or oil on your foot and it pours right through the holes in the top of your clogs onto your socks, you'll be wishing you had toughed it out in some less well ventilated shoes like these.They are rubberized clogs that can be run through the dishwasher and / or soaked in bleach etc, so cleaning them when they get funky is not an issue at all. They are so comfortable that my girlfriend steals them all the time even though they are huge and covered in food droppings from the restaurant.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Good graphics, fun power-ups (Little Stomper is my favorite) and a slot-machine style bonus at the end make this a very addicting game (and it's FREE).
1881273873|5.0|get it to always keep on hand.  everyone should  really buy a couple of copies to share with their single friends
B008N1V11U|5.0|Graphics are really cool I don't review many games but this is a must have<br />for batman fans only flaw is that it takes a while to load,but after that your<br />ready to go!!!!!!I think it's great you'll have to try to see........
B004EKCNMA|5.0|A very dark, yet fantastic take on this classic story. Download / buy this. Don't just stream it. You'll want to watch this every year to come.
0312330537|5.0|Best novel I've read in a while. I must warn that it is around 900 pages, but it has everything to keep you reading until you cry &#34;uncle!&#34;.
0525478817|5.0|I recommend &#34;A Fault in Our Stars&#34; unconditionally. Although, it is a love story about two teens with cancer and their families it is not a gratuitous tear jerker in any way. It is a real story with real life loving characters whose wit, humor, and love override the underlying struggle. Some stories just cut to the essence of life and relationships; this is one of them. You will love it too!!
B00B2G4O2G|5.0|Terrifying! I love this series. Hats off to Kevin Bacon. Excellent supporting cast of crazies. Always waiting for the next episode
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Good movie.  I like the story line, beginning was kind of lame.  The singing was amazing, good cast of characters.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I feel a kinship with the Irish for no known reason, so I am always looking at books set in Ireland. This is what attracted me to the book in the first instance. The plot sounded very interesting. And I am not disappointed.<br /><br />It is a beautifully written book full of pathos and heartache, but also moments which made my laugh out loud.<br /><br />This is a book of fiction but the parts describing the main character's incarceration in a Catholic orphanage are based on the accounts of real orphans. And those accounts are harrowing. I can't believe the things that were done to these poor children in the name of religion! However, I do not wish to add spoilers. Suffice it to say that despite the desperation and heartache there is, in the end, hope for a better life.<br /><br />Well worth the read.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Perfect!  It is just perfect for the Kindle Fire!  A must have if you own the Kindle Fire!  The grandkids love watching movies on it!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I am thoroughly enjoying West Wing. I use to watch it when it first came out but as I was working and was involved in other things I wasn't able to see the whole series. So glad the complete series came out on DVD.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I use to neglect and avoid my 9 children, now we all take turns playing Hungry Shark. All eight of my inlaws enjoy it too.<br />Question - Is there an option to stop or minimize the blood that oozes out of the sides of my Kindle HD Fire when I chew on the swimmers? Currently we use a kiddie pool and just collect the blood for soup and making blood sausage, but it would be nice to be able to turn it off on occasion.<br /><br />Also I heard that they are making a similar game based on a pack of wild dogs that allows the gamer to raom around neighborhoods and playgrounds feasting on human flesh.  Can't wait for that one to come out. Sure hope the oozing blood option is still offered.<br /><br />Drip Drip sip sip
B001AR44MW|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies and I love the sound track as well<br /><br />One of my all time favorite movies and love the soundtrack as well!
B008RTE08E|2.0|I'll skip Magical Mystery Tour since I found it terrible...and I'm a Beatle fan. I'm waiting (and hoping) for \\"Let it Be\\" to be re-released on DVD. That is a more interesting movie of the Beatles.
B001RCD2DW|5.0|Product arrived in excellent condition. The sound will make you sell your dre beats.the only issue is if you do want the perfect sound quality along with some worth while volume, you'll have to purchase a headphone amp(20 bucks)
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I love this film. Very insightful and exciting. There are, sadly, too few films with the intelligence and foresight wherein it allows the audience to think.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This is the first game I have purchased in quite a while. The colors and characters are very interesting and easy to work with. It requires more interesting moves than the other Jewels games I have played. All the Jewels games are so addictive! I enjoy all of them.
B007SGM084|5.0|I have to admit, I loved these books.  Interesting story line and characters, not to mention the other stuff.  Interesting.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Entertaining throughout. No slow parts. Thoroughly enjoyed it, especially knowing it was based on true events. If you like documentaries you'll love this.
B00AF6B22E|4.0|I really liked this movie, it made me re think about how we look at pilots when we fly. Denzel was great as usual one of my favorite actors. I strongly recommend seeing this movie.<br />I thought this movie was going to be about something else and caught me by surprise what the story line was about.
B004WMKSH2|5.0|My grandson just discovered the Harry Potter books. The movies just support his continued interest in reading.! He will continue to see all of the movies I am sure.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway suffers is a fun game but there needs to be cheeper products because who is going to have 180000 coins
B007FG9LIE|4.0|A book that cannot be put down for any length of time. Kept me on the edge of my seat. Excellent read.
B0084670FU|5.0|Had to pay attention to the movie, but very different and very good in my humble opinion.  What a role for Brad Pitt.  Nice to watch when you just want to hang at home with a adult friend with a good glass of wine and not think about anything else.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game. It's one of the best games I've ever played. It's really really fun. Can't get enough of it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I wasn't very good at the first temple run, but I liked playing it.  So, I didn't expect much from the 2nd version. Boy was I wrong.  This game is amazingly fun to play.  I'm a disabled vet and my reflexes aren't what they used to be, but that doesn't seem to matter.  The creators of this game must of had guys like me in mind when they made it. It's easy to play and doesn't require you to do more than pay attention.  I love and can't seem to stop playing until my battery goes dead.
B0011TMOIK|5.0|I downloaded this to my Amazon Instant Video, and had no problems with that whatsoever.  The movie is a classic and anyone who loves the books should really own all the films.  I did, but my grown children have made off with them!  :-)
B004Q3UL2O|1.0|Was looking for some adult mvie watching and this was just a dumb movie without any interest.  Was a waste of $$ and did not make it thought more than a few minutes.  There was no interest as the movie was so bad.
B003AKLFAG|2.0|Did not like the story & ending at all.  Very sick and twisted.  I don't recommend this.  Also the casting was odd.  The brother in the movie seemed way younger than the main character.
B000IDGDPA|5.0|for all women to see. The era added to the overall flavor of the story. Helen Hunt was perfect for he part.
0525953728|4.0|I have read both No Easy Day and The Finish: The Killing of Osama Bin Laden.  They are differing viewpoints of the same raid.  One from the point of view of those tasked with carrying out the raid and one from that of those involved in the decisions of what to do, how to do it, and when to do it.  Where the two accounts overlapped there appeared to be good agreement for the most part.<br /><br />Much has been made about &#34;secrets&#34; revealed in this book.  As I was reading through this account I found that there was almost nothing that surprised me - most of the operational information I was already aware of through various news accounts and because I am quite interested in military hardware and tactics.  I have never been in the military so all my knowledge came from just reading common books or materials I can find online.  The only things that I found new were details on exactly how portions of the mission were carried out such as the number of participants and their assignments.  And I don't see that revealing that information will compromise future missions because every mission of this type is different and will have different operational parameters.<br /><br />One portion I did find quite interesting was the contrast between the account of the waiting for a decision to go forward in this book and the description of those making the decision in The Finish.  Both books are worth reading to get a more complete account of the raid.
B00AHGH6XQ|4.0|Despite plotholes that everyone points out, I found this film a lot of fun. The pacing is decent, the story is well written and composed, and I think the acting was good enough to leave a decent impression of the characters. I really want there to be more, but I respect the idea of an open ending.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Anyone who buys this, already owns another, so you know what you´ll get... It´s perfect, just as you would expect.
B008220C38|1.0|I turned the movie off about half hour into it thinking it would get easier to follow. This never happened.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|It seems to help in all aspects of life. It is great for married couples but dealing with others helps you understand them better if you know what love language they speak.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Even though I was connected to the internet, I tried many times to register the app and all I got was a message saying there was no internet connection (even though there was a connection).
0307887448|5.0|This is a spectacular book. I'll start with the concept... the idea of a benefactor decreeing his life's earnings to a fan that can solve the riddles he left behind is intriguing. The world that Cline builds in order to do this is entirely believable and world-spanning. Every one in the world has a shot. The near-future setting where the hints are hidden in a virtual worldwide web is perfectly written.<br /><br />The fact that James Halliday, the OASIS's creator, was a fan of 1980s pop culture makes this a must-read. Numerous references to '80s music, tv, movies and general nostalgia flow off the page, and the way it's incorporated into the contest and the culture that has come out of it thanks to all the research into finding the treasure.... wow. Well done.<br /><br />None of this takes away from the actual writing. Cline is not only a creative writer, he is a great one. The characters are instantly likeable and multilayered. They are believable and engaging. And, I will read this again. I encourage anyone that is a fan of good literature to read this... and anyone that grew up in the '80s? This should be required reading.
B002RS7HGI|4.0|I have seen this movie twice now and love it just as much as the first time.  Any interest in this era will give you pleasure in the film I think.  Though not exactly accurate, it gives a glimpse of Elizabeth and her era.
B0093ST02E|3.0|Couldn't understand what the girl wanted, always crying even after they tried to make her happy! Maybe it is something I missed!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Great price, fast shipping, one happy customer!
B002WCLG48|5.0|Fantastic short stories, I fell in love with this movie the first time I watched it. It is a great movie, I recomend it to my fellow Halo fans
B00B9366VO|4.0|I have waited for this documentary for a while.  I love the history of the bands and the studio as it once was.  As an audio engineer I can appreciate the love for a good piece of gear.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Ofcourse, I love this whole series as apparently does the rest of the world. The dvds were in very good condition and delivery was as fast as i could be, due to the popularity of the product.
B00BSBY38A|3.0|The movie was ok, I am happy I did not spend the money to see it at the theater. It was an interesting but but not exciting enought to have won the oscars that it did. Would not add it to my library at home. Ihave seen it once that  is enough
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I would strongly recommend this product. after purchasing three months ago i have no issues and the price was reasonable. It runs all my games without any problems with settings on high/ultra e.g. Battlefield, COD, Starcraft, need for speed; also it can run these games with other applications (another game, downloading etc) running in the background. Its stable no random restarting as well as no overheating issues.
B007IGG0IA|5.0|love it. awesome collection of  songs. makes  you forget what the  regular versions sounded like. highly recommend if  your a fan at all
B003KKBPXI|5.0|I would recommend this record to anyone who is a jazz, contemporary jazz, R&B, soul, Blues and/or Classical jazz music lover or anyone who likes to relax and listen to a good album here and there. I love every song on this album and the vinyl record makes your nostalgia take over. I am very young and this album came out before I was born, but growing up listening to contemporary Jazz reminded me of this new wave that took over in the 80's.  Miles Davis's sweet melodic horn playing is very pleasing to me and the musical phrases are so intelligent and creative. He uses a mute in the majority of the album that provides a high pitched soft sound. I'm no music genius, so please don't butcher my musical descriptions. I just enjoy good music and this is exceptional. I think this was his last full album before he died in the 80's.This album had the fusion of synthesizers, soprano sax and a great percussion section.  I can't pick a favorite song but I would name  Portia, half nelson and backyard ritual as the top, but all of them are amazing and great for any mood. Please buy this album if you can find it and support good music. I would listen to this album over any crap that is flooding our radios.  TuTu is the best album I've ever heard.
B002APU580|5.0|This film is a perfect showcase for Keira Knightly's talents.  The great story, her accent and the period costumes make this a most enchanting film.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app has worked well since it was downloaded. Never had any problems. Cards move quickly, and app is easy to operate. If you like solitary, I recommend this app.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game rocks so many cool things happen during this obstacle course.I highly reccomend this game to anyone and everyone.No one could dislike this game
B000PMLFRA|5.0|There are a mind-boggling number of reviews already available on Star Wars, so this will be brief.<br /><br />At the time of this writing, this Blu-ray set is listed by Amazon as: \\"Star Wars: The Original Trilogy (Episodes IV - VI)\\", however, the actual title on the spine of the box is simply: \\"STAR WARS  IV  V  VI\\".  The word \\"original\\", as used by Amazon, is ambiguous.  You might think these are copies of the first three theatrical releases of the Star Wars Trilogy, but they are not;  these are the \\"upgraded versions\\" of episodes IV, V, and VI.  It appears the purpose of Amazon's use of the word \\"original\\" is simply to distinguish the first Star Wars Trilogy ( IV, V, and VI) from the second Star Wars Trilogy - the prequel set of episodes ( I, II, and III).<br /><br />Picture (Blu-ray - 2011):  4.5 to 5.  Measured Aspect Ration:  2.35:1.  Subtitles:  English, Espanol, Francais, Nederlands, Portugues, Suomi, Svenska, Norsk and Dansk.
B00846REIS|4.0|The book had a plot and steamy scenes that kept me reading.  A guilty pleasure and  an easy weekend read.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I thought this trilogy was all about sex but it's a great story. I'm so looking forward to the next.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the best game ever.  I think everyone in the world should get it. I really really love it!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the word of God, and any reference aid in helping with studying is is so wonderful. Thank you for this app.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It is worth the money!!I loved it!!<br />I would rate it on a scale<br /> 1-10 I would rate it 10 !!
B00BESFWBY|5.0|I thought this was a very inspirational film and was surprised to find out it was a based on a true story. I really enjoyed the story and the amazing cinematography during the surfing scenes.
0743243153|5.0|Fantastic book. Read this book right after \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" by Victor Frankl. After finishing Frankl's book, I remember thinking this book will probably be a let down. Man, was I wrong. This book is good right from the beginning and just gets better. While reading I had so many \\"aha\\" moments. The book was painful in parts because it guides you through introspection at a level that reveals some dark corners. But Peck doesn't just reveal, he helps you understand and heal. Unlike other reviewers, I don't want to give away much because, for me, the book was so enjoyable partially because the concepts were somewhat mysterious - unfolding like a great novel (but true). This book gets my highest recommendation.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I think that this app is AMAZING! It is a lot of fun.  I love to play it on my free time and try to find and figure things out. If you have ever heard of the game Clue, and you like it you probably would like this app. I think it is fun because you get to find and solve mysteries.
B001QJUX24|3.0|A new book which dealt entirely with the subject of John Ford's version of true events was just published.  It rated this movie as one of  John Ford's finest and probobly one of the finest westerns ever made and a big influence on Spielberg and Scorcese.  Sadly,  I found Jeffrey Hunter acting atrocious as were many of the secondary roles and they detracted from the movie.  Vera Miles' character should have been institutionalized she seemed so far outside normal behavior.  My daughter and I found ourselves laughing in the wrong places.  I Much more prefer Fords The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance to this movie and disagree with the author of the book &#34;The Searchers&#34;
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Always knew I was an introvert but her study of the subject and it's impact on so many aspects of our society is truly impresive. Read it if you are an introvert, read it if you are not but need to understand your friend, mate, co-worker, are an educator, run a business, in other words, anyone interested in knowing oneself better but more importantly, how introversion/extraversion shapes society.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Fun and entertaining app. Each run only lasts a few minutes so its easy to find time to play, though the leveling system is deep enough to keep you playing.
B001992NUQ|4.0|I bought this movie cheap, it got shipped, it arrived, it works. Yay. The disk was is new condition as advertised, and plays well.
1476715904|5.0|Colleen held me breathless with Hopeless. Now I've gone back to read anything else by her and here I am again, sucking a book down in a day. In the last few hours, I've swiped away tears, grinned like an idiot, and resisted punching my fist and yelling \\"YES!\\"<br />You did it again Colleen. You didn't write a story, you wrote an experience.<br />Now I must go buy music... by a certain Brothers.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is that the writing itself is okay but not worthy of a 5. Now the information about his personal experience of an NDE from someone with as much medical knowledge as he has and the &#34;miraculous&#34; recovery of one who should be either dead or brain dead is powerful and should be at least considered as validation of the NDE experience. But as one who has &#34;been there/done that&#34;, I am a believer. Try it, you might like it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|In a weird switch for a second book, I daresay this book was better than the first.  I came for the battle and bloodshed, but happily stay for the characters and the world.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This Book is so interesting....and a great Read.....i can say also the kindel book reading system is great also...nice deal
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|I purchased this after watching seasons 1 and 2 of Downtown Abbey.  The first two episodes of season 3 seem off-paced and disjointed.  Except for the wrenching deaths of two major characters (due to the actors wanting to do other things), the rest of the episodes were as absorbing as the first two seasons.  There was a story line through the season concerning the social and economic changes occurring during the early 1920s, after WWI, that I found absorbing.  Much more love lost than new love in this season, if that matters to you.
B0015DROBO|2.0|Sorry but I am not a mystery lover and found it boring. Only read about 3 chapters then fled to the end.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Super fun when you're bored or want to pretend like you're texting. Easy to  play and quick to restart a game which saves me a lot to of time and hassle. I would definitely reccomend this game to others
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Loved the movie but video kept stopping and I had to reset the whole thing twice.  I have had the same problem with the movies freezing up do that is my only gripe.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I loved Atlantis. This has many of the same elements with a British story line. The only drawback is the large file size. Fun and it exercises the brain!
0312330537|4.0|I read this book in a relatively short time, less than three weeks, considering I was working and traveling for work.  Roberts' fictionalized account of his 10-year odyssey in Mumbai's nether regions is gripping and compelling.  He draws most of the characters fully, and I developed an attachment to a number of them - Prabkhar, Didier, Vikram Patel, among others.  The sheer number of people described in detail is impressive, as are the experiences of the protagonist as he descends into Mumbai's underworld.  The rendering of the city of Mumbai is vivid and alive and the experiences described are palpable.  I engaged with this story fully, and felt the depth of the relationships formed and the intensity of the situations encountered.  I was struck particularly by the theme throughout Shantaram of the conflict between opening oneself to experiences and opportunities while simultaneously making sure to protect oneself and survive.  There are so many facets to this work that it is impossible to describe as merely an adventure or a fictionalized account of a real-life experience.  This is a one-of-a-kind read.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Fun stuff, swimming around eating fish, crabs, turtles, people, other sharks.<br /> Shark level up is cool, and everything is easy. Finger control takes practice, though.<br />So
B009RWRIKM|5.0|An inside look at such a fine artist.  Her company of extremely committed and creative individuals dazzles in every scene.  This is about so much more than dance; it's about acting, staging, environment, presence, total commitment, excellence, life.<br /><br />See it!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Very good story.The characters are so raw & endearing.<br />Couldn't put it down and didn't want it to end. Heartbreaking and funny!
B0042J6VUS|4.0|i love it i use it a lot for indoor photos.<br />plus the legs extend longer, for more effect on the distance
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I loved this movie.  It was a great adaptation of the book - which I also really enjoyed.  Very well-acted and a great soundtrack!
B009K0OL06|5.0|But it would be fine if all the loose ends are wrapped up by the end of this season...even the key actors are getting tired of the whole revenge thing... LOL
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Written in the plain language of a woman reporting her horror story, without dramatic or detailed emphasis on sexual abuse she, instead, captures the wind and water erosion of the spiritual abuse she endured daily. She exemplifies the strength of the human spirit. The reader witnesses her emotional hardiness and how, enhanced by the love-connection for her babies and animals, she finds divine connection with love in spite of growing up in a &#34;family&#34; where such a feeling-action-behavior-belief was non-existent. Amazing story!<br />Thank you for sharing, Jaycee .
B004SIIBGU|4.0|The portability factor is most important since one can stay on top of their eBay sales or purchases from anywhere. As a research tool, again, the availibility of information anywhere is a great aid for determining value when out and about. I would, however, like the color coding to match exactly (green is a bid, red is starting price). There in no blue among pricing and it is a distraction when fast viewing. All in all, a handy tool and free is always good!
B008I3RARW|2.0|The simulation engine has potentials, I have to admit (that's why the 2 stars and not one...), but seriously? The rest is non-existent.<br />One car, one track, max 3 laps...<br />Game is also poor of variations of what you can do with 1 car and 1 track.<br />You can race against two other losers (seriously, even if you never played this game, you overtake them at the first turn).<br />You can do one lap by yourself<br />You can do one lap by yourself with a timer going down...<br /><br />... wow.
B00899ES5C|4.0|If there is a fourth season of this, I won't likely be watching.  These girls never learn anything from their mistakes, and never stop lying.  It it time already to get to the end of the mystery, before these chicks all have to go off to college or whatever.
030759565X|5.0|I have been a fan of Deb's blog for quite some time now, and have made several recipes from it. Deb has the unique ability to take an intimidating recipe, break it down with spunk, common sense and experience, and bake it into something understandable to a &#34;chef&#34; even as utterly novice as me. I was super excited when she released her new cookbook and couldn't wait to get a peek inside. Thanks to the thoughtfulness (or was it simply hunger?) of my husband, I received it for my birthday this week!<br /><br />Per her traditional style, Deb begins every recipe in her new cookbook with a delicious description that leaves you convinced of your immediate need to consume it. You can literally sit down and read through her cookbook and come away feeling satiated. And her photography is mouthwatering. The range of colors and textures in her recipe photographs is quite tantalizing.<br /><br />Her instructions are clear and understandable, rarely requiring the use of any special kitchen tools or know how. . With skills as unimpressive as mine, I enjoy making dishes that include exciting words like &#34;rugelach&#34; or &#34;bechamel.&#34; It makes a week night dinner feel fancy. I appreciate the flexibility she allows for in her ingredient selections and in her preparation methods. Her no excuses attitude encourages you to make what you already have, work. I was thankful for the section she included at the end that listed her staple kitchen &#34;must haves.&#34; Her practical favorites helped me better outfit myself for every day cooking.<br /><br />Like Deb, I am a mother of a toddler and an apartment dweller with a small and unimpressive kitchen. Thanks to her encouragement and gung-ho attitude, I have attempted many dishes, while tripping over a busy little person in a space that felt far too limited a canvas for creations that seemed well beyond my scope. Surprisingly, I have yet to fail at one.<br /><br />My kitchen holds new intrigue and potential, largely due tothe Smitten Kitchen. I would definitely recommend this cookbook for anyone, but especially the intimidated, relatively new to the kitchen types. Deb will get them on their feet!
B0061S073A|4.0|I love this app. I downloaded it after my 2 year old was able to factory reset my Kindle this morning.  I thought that the Parental Controls that already exist on the KF would keep it from being factory reset but I found out the hard way that it does not.  This app does everything I would ever need it to do and so far it is working as I had hoped.<br /><br />One suggestion I would make (maybe for a feature in the future if possible) is the ability to add not just apps on the main screen but also books.  On my KF I have at least 2 dozen digital books that I read with my 2 year old son.  That is how he got interested in the KF to begin with.  If we could also have the ability to select books to appear on the main screen I think that would make this app that much better.  I would even pay up to $5 for an app that does that.  I have yet to find an app that provides that feature.  If you could go a step further and also allow certain videos to be added to I think that would be awesome as well.<br /><br />Overall, great app and I will be telling my friends and family about it too :)<br />Thank you!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book makes me proud to call these men &#34;shipmates&#34; and thank them for the many sacrifices they have made to keep this country free!  Go Navy!
0634022296|5.0|I used to have the Beatles Complete Scores book, but I actually prefer the Beatles Complete Chord Songbook. Usually when I sit down to play guitar, I'm not interested in the scores for all the instruments. I just want to know the chords and lyrics; this songbook fills that need. My only complaint is that with the way the book is bound, it's impossible to open it flat on a music stand. To fix this problem I took it to a local office supply chain store, where in their print shop they cut off the binding and replaced it with a plastic spiral binding. With this new binding, it's easy to keep the book open flat on a music stand. With the original glued binding, the book was basically unusable because I had no way of keeping it open so that I could keep both hands on my guitar instead of holding open the book.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|?  So far I like it.  Have purchased other G5 games and enjoyed them.  Sofar this one is ok.  Graphics are very exceptional._  I will purchase additional games in the future.
0763644765|5.0|My son loves books and i leave this one out in the livingroom with his toys and he loves to open the book up. Hoping it will help
B00A14SQBU|5.0|This album is awesome. I can listen to this whole album without wanting to skip any of the tracks. This album is so well rounded and definitely worth the purchase.
B009RH973I|5.0|Great case for the 7&#34; kindle fire HD.  Very light, the strap makes a handy holder, cutouts for the speakers, and you can charge it when the case is closed.  Kindle 'klicks' in very securely.  Would definitely buy again.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|If you are in the mood for a good romantic book, this is it! I started to read it one Saturday afternoon and I couldn't put it down! I read it in one day!! Such a great book!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was a heart warming book.  I wanted to read it before the movie came out.  Then I didn't get a chance to see the movie.  It was a very good book!
B0013FBS20|4.0|This review is for the blu-ray transfer only and not the film itself.  The blu-ray edition of I Am Legend looks fantastic.  Details are very sharp and colors are rich.  This enhances the CGI shots of post-apocalyptic New York City.  As some other reviewers have pointed out, the CGI characters look a bit cartoonish.  It is not so much the appearance that troubled me, however, but rather they way they move.  They run, jump and attack at speeds that defy physics--like the early Spiderman movies.  This makes it all the more obvious that they are CGI.  Apart from that quibble, I enjoyed the movie very much--more than I did the first time I saw it in the theater.<br /><br />This edition did come with an optional alternate ending.  While it was interesting, I prefer the ending of the theatrical release.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I expected a light, okay kind of story.  I have never enjoyed a book more.  After staying up late to get to the ending, the next morning I felt like I had lived that ending with them.  Looking forward to seeing the movie soon.  I liked everything about it.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|This is by far my favorite tv show!! If you are looking for a good laugh this is a must have!!!!
B007MB5OCE|1.0|In a few words -- It was not the kind of book I like to read.  Very strange to say the least!  But then, I like murder mysteries and love stories so I wouldn't want to blackball the book----but my husband didn't even finish it.  He thought it was terrible too! LOL
B008OW1S3O|5.0|! Simply the best album I've listened to in a very long time.<br />## ## ## ## ## ## ##

B00BHMETKC|5.0|I had been looking forward to seeing Argo even before the Oscar.  It lived up to expectations and the very beginning is enlightening for anyone who is unfamiliar with history in the middle east.  True stories don't leave any surprises as to the ending, but the ride on this one is still full of tension.
0307895475|5.0|Arrived quickly and it's amazingly full of surprises that I didn't even know existed in the game! I would recommend to any Skyrim fan.
B003UESJ9M|5.0|I am one of those who has, well issues with Paltrow, I tend to find her a bit sanctimonious and well, yeah. It effects how I view her characters and movies. This movie, though, is fun and interesting, the characters are engaging and its just a good movie to watch, heartbreaking, but good. I was able to get enough into the plot to actually watch the movie and enjoy it for what it is. Plus I love the music!
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|she is a very controversial star but she is human!! her music always reflects her life and what it is meaning to her when she records, kudos!!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|This was definitely my favorite of all  the books with FBI Agent Aloysious Pendergast. I couldn't put it down, and I expect the next one will be great as well.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|After the big crash in 2008 I gave up even looking at fashion magazines. But after a friend reminded me about ebay I have discovered so many wonderful treasures that make me feel like the queen of everything when I wear them. The best part is nothing I have purchased has cost over $40.00!  I LOVE EBAY!
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I purchased this boxed set because I had never owned all the Beatles albums.  The re-mastering is great and the sound very crisp.  I highly recommend this set to anyone.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|This was every bit as exciting, gut wrenching, entertaining as I expected it to be. Now I just have to save up enough money for season 4.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome! This app rocks I absolute love it! Especially if you like animals it gives you the oppurtunity to experience the challenges of taking care of an animal.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green has done if again with this book! Absolutely amazing. Just the right amount of mushy love paired with existential thought. You can't help but love Hazel Grace and Augustus.
B0039TD7RC|5.0|I had this album on vinyl and bought it to improve my cpllection of Stones' CDs.  I particularly like the supplemental CD because it gave some clues to the evolution of the album.
B009XY97VC|5.0|As always, Two Steps From Hell has produced an amazing album! I love all of the tracks and listen to them frequently at home and at work.  If anyone wants to add a little bit of EPICNESS to their life...then listen to this CD!  :-)
B005IDXIL2|3.0|The only drawback is that it does not save your games. Needs to have a way to look back on your scores.
0446581356|5.0|Bobbi makes makeup easy to understand and I love that she uses ethnic models. Her products are fantastic and you can go from an every day look to an evening look.
B00AGKH6D8|3.0|I bought this CD on a pre-order special and didn't get to sample any of the music first.  It is an interesting set of instrumentals and pointed out how closely related the funk groove can be to jazz formats.
1608955702|5.0|this book really opened my eyes to ''seeing light'' in a way I wasn't seeing it before. This book is full of ideas, that will improve your work 100 times.. Use these ideas to build on your normal photos and you will see a huge difference
B006YTTVHO|3.0|Have to read more and try some of the tactics from the book. Some good tips Jury is still out.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I was shipped a fake product. It was not a real Lifeproof case. I lost all of my money on this company.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|If you love period dramas, you will absolutely love this.  Every actor was made for the roles they play at Downton Abbey
B008I3RARW|2.0|Very boring game. Not a good as others I have played before. try any other game please and a good 3d one.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I love this game. I enjoy the hidden picture games and the various puzzles. I wish it was a little more involved though...
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This is a great game,gets your brain working and can certainly improve the eye sight!!Keeps you wanting to play the game without a break, great graphics and a wonderful story.
B00BJZJXWG|5.0|And coincidentally, both albums are produced by Robin Hannibal, who is quite possibly the best producer in the industry at the moment. If you don't believe me just google \\"Dirty Secrets\\" by Louie, or possibly \\"Løb Stop Stå\\" by Boom Clap Bachelors. If you like these songs you will love this album. Also, if you have not yet heard Quadron's album, do yourself a favor and purchase it immediately.<br /><br />To put it simply, nobody is making music like this currently. NOBODY. This is actual music, not vapid synthetic fluff. If you want many successive eargasms I would suggest listening to Mr. Hannibal's music ASAP.
B009MO5E10|1.0|\\"Premium Rush\\"<br /><br />This was easily one of the worst films I've ever seen, in any genre. I mean, it's not quite as bad as \\"Jade\\" or \\"Showgirls\\" or \\"Poetic Justice,\\" but it's pretty close.  In fact, the lack of that extra layer of pure awfulness makes this less of a classic than those steamers, since this film suffers more from mediocrity and poor direction than from pure, cosmic-level stinkiness. My wife and I went into this with low expectations, anticipating a not-great-but-watchably-mindless action flick with two actors we admire (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who has been doing amazing work recently in films such as \\"50/50\\" and stone-faced Michael Shannon, who was riveting in \\"Boardwalk Empire\\".)<br /><br />From the opening first few seconds, it was apparent that the director was playing this for laughs, with the character stereotypes so broad and the plot and script so brazenly bad that the idea was hey, just relax into it and enjoy the ride. Sadly, though, there wasn't enough substance behind the nudge-nudge, wink-wink to sustain any real interest, and the laxness of the filmmaking infects the entire project. The performers clearly quit trying early on: Gordon-Levitt goes all Keanu and blank, happy to cash a check for just riding a bike round and getting a good workout, while Shannon barks and shouts and glowers his way through bad scene after bad scene -- an actor who thrives on restraint was told to over-emote and chew scenery, and it was a huge mistake.<br /><br />At its core, \\"Premium Rush\\" is simply not a good film. It could have been an okay popcorn-muncher but it wound up being a worthless dud. Like, shockingly lame. There's one fun scene with James Hong speaking unsubtitled Chinese, but that's about it. There's really nothing else worth watching in the entire film. (Axton)
B006N38104|4.0|Seal does a wonderful job of showcasing his voice on this one. I love his rock and roll sound applied to these soulful classics.
B00284G2IA|5.0|It´s beatiful, i love the band so this concert sound an looks so good and teh quality of video and sound is pretty good
1451695195|5.0|Having read about out of body experiences and afterlife for many many years, this book is the #1 must read book.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I purchased this app. I have 4 people that I care for for the state. Each person has so many things that need to be done for each. I made a notebook for each and titled each with their names. So now they have their own notebook, with to do lists, medical lists, progress notes, etc.
B004NS710C|4.0|A great fun entertaining movie about a runaway train.  Trains are always great to watch and this is well done.
1610454812|5.0|I've never been in the military, but I highly value and respect our military personnel. Unfortunately, the left-wing liberal \\"drive by\\" media usually limits their news coverage to sensational stories of injustices, cowardice and body counts. Here is a story of a true military hero, one that understands and underscores the value of human dignity in time of war. Adam Brown doesn't delight in killing anyone, his goal is the protection of the innocent, including those in hostile territory.<br /><br />Although the writer is not a Christian, he treated the spiritual context with great thoughtfulness, consideration and honesty. Eric Blehm does not shy away one bit from exploring the relevance of Adam's faith and the spiritual imprint he left upon those close to him. He chronicles his spiritual journey, which includes time at a Teen Challenge facility and his intense ongoing struggle with drug addiction. I found it interesting that he mentions one of his friends having spent time at a Christian commune in Switzerland, Francis Schaeffer's L'Abri, no doubt. He takes the reader through the rigorous training of the seals, spotlighting Adam's fearless, unquestioning determination to get the job done. There is also the time of Adam's youthful ruckus, which is as entertaining as it gets.<br /><br />This is clearly a book that can be shelved with biography, Christian inspiration as well as Guns and Ammo. Well written and well read. Highly recommended. I noticed a complaint about the language. There were less than ten profanities in the 10.5 hour audiobook, none of them included misusing God's name.
B0066W1AZK|2.0|Chess takes a while to play a match.<br /><br />This game does not retain the current game when you leave and come back to it. Thus I personally find it useless.<br /><br />If it did retain your game when you leave, I think it would be quite a good game. But that lack, makes it of little value to me.
B006GKHE6G|1.0|i tried to buy it but an error came up on my screen saying that it was unable to download
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|This game is kinda hard turning is  really hard so if your good at advance games this is the one for you I'm not very good but ya know it happenss :)
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Very exciting start.  The Denzel's character is a loser despite being a great pilot. Classic story of redemption.  Well worth watching.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Great read. First Lee Child book that I have read. Will probably read more. Better to start the series rather than jump into a middle book. Love reading on Kindle.
B004ZA9HB4|2.0|You might have better luck, but this didn't work with my smart Samsung blu-ray player and my ASUS transformer prime.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Greeeeeaaaaaaaattt!!!!!!!! book!!!!!!! I really recommend it to everyone. Some parts of the book almost made me cry . Totally worth the money!
B002LFVE4I|3.0|Too formula. It almost a spoof of a &#34;who done it&#34;. Some good actors, some bad dialog. Got kind of boring.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Just had to read it since I loved Gone Girl. I'll be watching for her next book! Love reading on Kindle.
8866137626|5.0|I have to type 20 words, but Evernote & Moleskine did just Great the combination. And also have 3 months to have Premium Fun at the cloud...
B00B2064IY|5.0|I am always skeptical of &#34;new&#34; material released from the vault - if it is so good then why was it in the vault in the first place? Not true here - this material could easily have been a hit back in the 60's and deserves to be a hit now.
B00B2YH7BS|5.0|Great insight into some of the most historical albums of all time! You can watch this over and over again.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone. It is a fast paced read that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I wish Robert could grow up, get realistic, stop being so rigid.  I don't really like Shirley McClain (sorry about spelling), but otherwise the series is thoroughly involving and wonderfully cast.  Sybil and Matthew were favorite characters, both trying their best to be as fulfilled, as socially beneficent,  as possible, but the actors had to leave--I understand, but am very sorry--I was disappointed by both deaths.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Great descriptive story. Builds slowly from book to book, but overall has a good pace. Epilogue seems a bit out of place.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|I thought I could just tilt instead of dragging my finger, but no. that's the only bad part. besides that this is a fun game and feels like an adventure
B00AREIAI8|4.0|So far it's cute and easy to use. Suited for all ages. My nieces love it and use it more often then me lol.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|this is a great series.  i love all the actors and am really sad there are only five seasons.  again, just like the first and second seasons, it is truly science fiction and not occult.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|great game with a fun story line.  gives you tools to help at every level.  some of the boards seem quite easy, others are very challenging.  would recommend this game to friends.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I liked how the plot became more interesting as the book went on. I can't wait to read the next one !
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Recently tried this on Kindle and it was worth every star! Would recommend this to anyone who relies on this app for day-to-day productivity. The UI design is made fir for Kindle devices.
B002M2N9JI|5.0|The cd came in great condition and was not scratched and worked perfectly. Case was intact and the album cover was in good shape with the manual and everything.
0316228532|2.0|I knew it wouldn't be a continuation of Harry Potter, but I thought it would be interesting.  After reading far enough to have brushed past a whole book's worth of characters (and I understand I didn't meet them all), I hadn't found one in whom I had any interest.  I didn't care about any of them.  There was no one I wanted to spend more time with.  So I didn't.  I am now able to put a book down unfinished, and this one qualified for that.  I'm sorry.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think the game is very fun and interacts well with people especially young kids. It's . Nice to play 4 stars
B004UNX1LS|3.0|It is a good alternative to Youtube on Kindle. But there is no option to view the videos in HD. It seems the video quality depends on the connection speed which is a downside to this. Otherwise this limited app just for music videos is a delight to few.
B008M36EEI|5.0|Well written and well acted this movie delivered a great entertainment value. It has enough depth and character to make it believable yet fantastical enough to give it a story book feel.<br /><br />This kind of movie can easily miss the mark and seem trite. The quality of the production and performances keep it out of that realm and plant it firmly in a promise delivered of elevating entertainment.
B00BESLHEA|2.0|True to Chinese movies.  Too much blood and gore for me.  I love a good Chinese fight movie but one that does not contain a lot of blood.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|My 5 year old granddaughter and I love this movie. Of course it's a great story by Roald Dahl, his humor transcends generations. Clooney, Streep, and Murray are a bonus, amazing personalities they bring to their characters. Wonderful music. So funny. It's a cuss of a great movie.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|For your facebook fix, this app does all that ever a facebooker needs. Would appreciate if the app didn't lag at a point of time. UI needs to be little more responsive. Other then that, its all great!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this site. So many ideas for my home and garden. I could spend all day on here.  Definitely worth checking out.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I like the changes, finally taking Ms. Moneypenny from behind the desk and kudos for making her a woman of color.  Sorry to see M die, but at least her character left on her own terms and not forced to retire. Glad to see Q has gotten younger, means he will be around for a while.  Also, glad to see it was not about sex but action.  Love the action. Kudos Daniel Craig.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Even though you know how the story ends, the author manages to build an in depth portrait of the main character, Lincoln, and of each of his &#34;rivals.&#34;  Thoroughly researched, the author weaves quotations into the natural language of participants in the drama.<br />The only distraction was the poor copyediting and proofreading by Amazon in producing the Kindle Touch version.  Misspellings are profuse [and not in quoted material], with hyphentions appear-ing within the text with their hyphen-ated sign.  There has to be a way you could correct that, Amazon.  Otherwise, this is an excellent read.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Good app for those who relay on the weather before they travel to certain places or would like to keep updated about other places. Would appreciate if the background on &#34;todays&#34; section be lighter as one can't easily see the weather of the local location at a glance.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This is a fun game to waste some time. Couldn't stop playing but wish you could go farther without having to pay. I Love the hidden object mini games.
B0015DROBO|4.0|i like this series, it helped when i watched the movie. it is a good series, i would recommend it
B007REV4YI|5.0|The latest Bond delivers spine-tingling excitement and overpowering sensations!  Daniel Craig gives an intense powerful performance!  Loyal Bond fans will love this as well as everyone else!  Overall &#34;Awesome&#34; rating!
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I like the movie However I was offended by Hollwood bashing the USA's policis in the middle East. This is typical of Hollowood and is to be expected.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|Saw it in theaters, kids loved it.  Shipped very fast.  It was a Great price and I would purchase again
B000NY12CI|4.0|Ayaan speaks candidly about her life raised as a Muslim, living in several different countries and the struggles she encounters as she realizes her faith and own ideals of equality don't match up.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|It was very funny I thought it would be a little better but worth a watch not really for kids.
0307711773|5.0|Both my 5 and 7 grader love listening to this books in the car. Makes all our time in the car go by faster.
B0027ZCQ4E|4.0|I already submitted this part. So that is all I'm going to say.  You can't get anything else from me.
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|Story was very well written! Great movie for all ages. Definitely recommend this movie for any time of the year.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Saw this originally on the big screen and knew that I would buy it for my own movie collection. Beautifully filmed and poignant love story (not your typical &#34;fluff&#34; piece).
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great quality on Amazon Video. best way to keep watching and rewinding when needed. Able to take on the go and a great season full of entertainment!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it!There is one flaw though.I can't find out how to change my skin.Other than that it is awesomly amazing.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|This app does what it says on the tin. It has really helped my daughter manage her kindle use.<br />Definitely a good buy.
B004JZBGWI|1.0|updated my droid RAZR and lost my sticky notes.  Downloaded this one and love it!! Like that it automaticly saves the changes.  Would recommend this one.
0810989956|5.0|My son loves this book. He had the original one and filled it up with his own pictures and writing. He liked it so much, he asked for another one, so I got him this revised and expanded edition. This is the perfect book for a Diary of a Wimpy kid fan who likes to write. It would also make a nice gift.
B00B2064IY|5.0|This is great music.  Must have in your collection if your a Jimi Hendrix fan.  The two stand out songs are Easy Blues and Somewhere which can be played on the radio today and sound fresh.  Do yourself a favor and buy this masterpiece.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Everything about Downtown Abbey is perfect. The acting, storylines, custumes, set and scenery, historic references, well like I said &#34;everything&#34;. I couldn't stop watching once I started, and had to limit myself to 2 episodes a day or that is all I would have been doing. I am glad to have this on DVD so I can replay parts and use the subtitles. This is indeed quality television at it best.
B0084IG7KC|3.0|My girlfriend and I had the same reaction. It was just a fair movie. I guess I set my expectations too high.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Good book, if a bit too predictable at times. I would have liked to have some of the other characters' perspectives.
B0077EBWVI|4.0|Initially I was skeptical to know that they were remaking Footloose.  However, I was pleasantly surprised at how well it turned out.  Williard MiGHT be even better in this remake......MAYBE. :-)
B00A72989U|4.0|I think you all should give Mrs. Keys a shot by downloading her new albulm.  If you a truly a music lover, pay attention to the tracks that seriously display her music ability to play the piano. If, you isolate all of the other stuff & listen to her play thoses keys --&#62; then you should be greatly satisfied ;D I know I am.<br />T.E. White
B0037VNX44|5.0|I've been wanting to watch this movie for a while now.  After seeing a preview for it, I immediately downloaded Bronson and was not disappointed. Tom Hardy owns this character so well that you forget it's him. The movie is simply amazing.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|Unfortunately the ending spoiled what could have been a very strong argument about the importance of a father figures for boys.  Otherwise, great sci-fi flick.
B007OV9EYG|5.0|Great movie and good to have the combo pack for multiple viewing options. I ended up buying the sound track to keep my kids happy.
B003Y5HWGI|3.0|I have not had a chance to watch this yet. I am collectings all of the seasons to watch when I retire.
044042335X|5.0|Slight spoilers....<br /><br />Bad Luck and Trouble is a reunion book of sorts for Jack Reacher. While most of the series is about his solo cross country vigilante actions, this time we see him as a member of a unit as he works with the former members of his special investigation team in the army. The book opens with a tortured man being thrown out of a helicopter 3,000 feet into the air above the desert. We come to find out that the man was a member of Reacher's old MP investigation team.<br /><br />Reacher's former teammate Frances Neagley tracks him down through his bank account and informs him of the death. Immediately Reacher decides that the perpetrators are dead man walking and he will find them. Neagley convinces him that they need to get the old band back together as they wouldn't want to miss out on a chance to reunite to avenge their former teammate. When they begin to have trouble locating the rest of the group they begin to discover that their deceased teammate wasn't the only member of the team to be taken out. Now as the surviving members of the team slowly join them they begin to work to figure out who was able to get the jump on his old teammates and take out the people that Reacher held in such high regard, who he considered even better investigators than he.<br /><br />You also get to go with Reacher as he explores the lives that his teammates, dead and alive, have gone onto live since leaving the army like he did. You actually get to see Reacher embarrassed and uncomfortable for once about his lifestyle as he feels like little more than a bum next the rest, especially Neagley, who have mostly gone onto successful careers and appear to live comfortable and domesticated lives, everything Reacher has tried to avoid. They pity him so much that they even pay for Reacher's meals because they don't think he has a lot of money (and he doesn't).<br /><br />Its a very entertaining, one of the best Reacher books that I've ever seen. You get an adversary who is a real match for the special investigators. Someone who was already able to defeat the special investigators before Reacher was even involved. Its a mystery that challenges even Jack Reacher's abilities and he comes up lacking more than once in the book, for this case he needs Neagley and co. to help him solve the case.<br /><br />Its a great novel and you finally get a taste of the way life was for Reacher when he was an MP, moreso than you do when you read a prequel book like The Affair.

030758836X|5.0|Gone Girl is the third novel by American author, Gillian Flynn. \\"She was the girl that every girl wanted to be: beautiful, brilliant, inspiring and very wealthy. He was the guy that all men admired: handsome, funny, bright and charming. But on July fifth, their seemingly perfect world came crashing in when Amy Elliott Dunne disappeared on their fifth wedding anniversary.\\" Flynn alternates narrations from husband Nick Dunne starting the day of the disappearance with diary entries by Amy Elliott Dunne starting when she first met Nick, and later, narrations by Amy, to gradually lead the reader through a tense, clever plot with some breathtaking twists and turns. Along the way, she touches on the power of TV and social media, the influence of good (and bad) parenting and whether anyone can really know their spouse. With plenty of black humour, Gone Girl is witty, scary, funny and brilliant.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is the best game ever I just got it on my new ipod touch that I got for my birthday and it is certainly not boring at all not one bit!!

0679735909|4.0|Possession: A Romance is the second stand-alone novel by British author Antonia S. Byatt, and winner of the 1990 Booker Prize. Roland Michell is a literary scholar whose special interest is 19th century poet, Randolph Henry Ash. When he happens upon drafts of letters written by Ash to an unnamed woman, his investigations lead him to another 19th century poet, Christabel LaMotte, and the expert on that poet's works, Professor Maud Bailey. Using a fascinating combination of folk tales, myths, sagas, memoirs, journals, letters, fairy tales, biographies and many poems, Byatt tells the stories of the romance of Randolph Ash and Christabel LaMotte, and, eventually, Roland Michell and Maud Bailey. As she slowly builds up this romance, Byatt also comments on faith and religion, the dissection of literary works, lesbianism and feminism, writing, reading and the ownership of literary treasures. Parallels abound between the two romances, although the action doesn't really hot up until the final 80 pages, with an exciting graveyard climax and a lump-in-the-throat epilogue. While there is an abundance of verbose old letters, virtually impenetrable text about poets' works and long tracts of 19th century poetry, these do give the work authenticity and some readers may enjoy these even if others find them tedious. Certainly, Byatt manages to craft characters whose fate the reader cares about, be they 19th century poets or 20th century scholars. Worth persisting with.
1616550414|4.0|This book is a book that you should read right away, or it ends up sitting under the rest of you \\"to-read\\" literature. Don't get me wrong, this book is a great in-depth view at the never-before-seen pre-production artwork and character design. If you are interested in the production of the games, the story line, and why this is this and that is that then you will read this book in a week, a day even. But if you expect any more, or any less, don't purchase this book. Or, you could always buy it and let it sit for a while.
0425210480|3.0|Rated okay - older book but as always Clive Cussler delivers highly readable books to the public who follow his work.
